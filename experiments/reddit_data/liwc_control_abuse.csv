ag48vo,71 year old Grandma is being mean,My grandma has been yelling at me because I told her something she didn't like.  I told her that I needed to go home because my back hurt.  She then throws a temper tantrum because I don't want to hang out with her.  At that point I was being yelled at in the Walmart because I said I was scared.  What does she do? She calls an ambulance because I caused her to have her 11th massive heart attack.  She always blames me for everytime she ends up in the hospital.  How do I tell my grandma to leave me alone? This is going on two decades of listening to her rant about how she's perfect and I'm not.

ag5xb6,What's abuse?,"I don't feel abused, but I also have a mindset of saying anything about being uncomfortable is selfish and attention seeking so even thinking about it makes me stop myself and tell myself to stop being so selfish and not think about it; until it happens again. And I see posts all the time about mental and emotional abuse and 3/4's of the time I recognize it, but then immediately shut down and make myself think that I'm forcing it and that my parents/family love me and that they aren't like that and that there are people that have it so much worse so I shouldn't complain about such little things but I keep seeing posts and I just don't understand because my family is not horrible and we have so many friends and people like us so why do I feel so horrible. We are family so that means we defend each other and love each other no matter what, even if we are being assholes to each other and it's shameful to even think about turning from family or thinking bad about them. And Mom and Dad just care and are trying to protect me even though it feels like I'm suffocating and I want to leave but they love me and it would hurt them if I left and you're not supposed to hurt family. And even if you disagree with mom and dad the bible says to honor you're mother and father and when they say to do something you do it and when they say not to do or say something you don't, even if you disagree. But that's how family works and you are supposed to listen to your parents and there is nothing wrong with that, it's not strange that's how all families are, because parents are always right, so why do I see posts and feel so goddamn awful?!",htbymwthm,2019-01-14 23:11:05,0,322,1,56.17,46.65,1,46,12.42,96.27,65.53,22.05,12.73,6.83,1.55,2.48,0,1.86,9.32,1.24,8.7,11.18,11.8,18.63,3.73,22.05,2.8,1.24,2.48,0.62,2.17,8.7,1.55,7.14,1.24,1.55,0.62,15.22,4.97,0.31,0.93,0.93,17.08,4.04,2.48,2.17,3.73,1.24,6.52,4.66,0.93,1.86,1.86,1.24,0.31,0,0,0,9.63,5.9,0.93,0.93,0,2.17,0.93,17.7,0.31,5.28,0.31,1.55,3.42,0.31,2.17,2.17,0,0.31,0,0.62,0.62,0,0,0,0,10.25,1.55,2.17,0,0.31,0.62,0.31,0,0,4.66,0,0.62
ag6wma,Failed Fathers,"Hey all, this is my first post here. So the tldr: two dads abused me at different points in my life, and now I have a general distrust of all men, including my current SO.

So my biological father raped me. Multiple times. Before I was 5 years old and during. I've made peace with that for the most part. In fact, in comparison to the way my adoptive father abused me, I've handled it much better. The man who legally adopted me while married to my mom was manipulative, narcissistic, controlling, and would constantly belittle myself and my 2 half brothers. He and my mom divorced about 7 months ago, and he recently essentially claimed on Facebook he didn't have any kids with his ex, when he did in fact adopt me and thus, obviously, had a kid with his ex. That's obviously been bothering me.

My paranoia has risen in the last couple of months. This is somewhat of a trend with boyfriends and in relationships. However it's happening later than usual. So I thought I was doing better. But now I've been paranoid any time he's defensive over his phone that he's hiding something from me. Like a girl or something. He goes to school when I'm asleep, and I work when he's asleep. Our only time together, unless he's on vacation, is over the weekend. Even that will get cut short if he's sick or gets busy with other things.

Side note: I've dated two abusive alcoholic men as well. One was openly alcoholic, the other hid it.

Now my paranoia is including things like, ""He says he's sick, and I believe him. But what if he's sick because he's drinking heavy again?"" Even though I know he's not. Or I want to believe he's not? This was a warning sign I missed in my second alcoholic relationship, hence the paranoia.

I guess my issue is, do I trust my gut that's telling me he's hiding something? Or do I tell him my paranoia and anxiety are high and need support without telling him what I'm paranoid about? I don't want to go after him and find out he's 100% genuine, because as anyone with anxiety and paranoia can tell you, you can't always trust your gut. But if my gut is right and I'm blinded by rose colored glasses, how on earth do I tell?

Please help. This has been driving me nuts and worsening my depression.",booklover9608,2019-01-15 01:51:09,1,414,8.31,43.28,70.06,1,12.55,17.63,95.17,58.7,23.91,18.36,11.35,0.24,0.72,6.04,0,5.56,3.14,10.87,12.56,6.28,10.14,1.45,17.87,6.04,3.38,1.69,2.42,2.42,7.97,1.93,6.04,2.17,1.45,0.72,15.46,2.17,0.24,0.72,8.21,13.53,1.45,1.93,1.69,3.86,1.69,5.31,1.21,0.48,0.48,0.24,3.86,1.21,1.93,0.24,0.97,7,2.17,1.21,1.93,0.97,1.93,3.38,15.22,0.24,13.77,0.97,5.31,7.49,1.45,1.69,0,0,0,0,1.21,0,0.24,0,0.24,0,20.53,6.52,5.56,0.48,0,1.21,0,0,0.48,6.04,0,0.24
agc42t,Sister verbally abuses me and today she hit me. I defended myself by holding her down and now she tells people what I done was wrong. Was it?,"Not sure if this is the right sub to post here, but I have no one else to talk to for advice.  She has a way of getting people to side with her by crying and making out I've done something seriously wrong to her in most arguments.

I'm an adult, so is my sister, unfortunately I am stuck living here.  Today she got verbally abusive towards me (she does this a lot, usually I ignore it as I don't have a choice), stuck her middle finger up to me.  I done the same (I couldn't help it), so she hit me.  The hit wasn't painful, or at the face, but the look on her face and body language gave the impression that more was coming my way, so I defended myself by grabbing her by the back of the head and holding her down on the floor.  After about 10 seconds I let her go and I went my own way.

She is convinced that she can hit me, but what I done to her was wrong.  I tried to explain to her and other family members (who feel sorry for her and think I am in the wrong because I am a male and stronger) that you can't go around hitting people and expect that person to not defend themselves, regardless of gender.

Anyone got some advice and good articles I can share with them to read.  I tried to get my point across that she can't hit me and expect me to stand there and take it, but they come from a different time.

agdlmu,has anyone's parents stopped being abusive?,"ny story isn't sad at all. my mom used to be both verbally and physically abusive towards al of us but me in particular since as long as i remember. it got really bad in middle school to the point where i suicidal because of her. she only used to hit when i did something wrong and she was angry she didn't hit for fun or anything i know it's still bad but yeah. she used to abuse me verbally ALL the time. i'm now 18 (living with my parents) and i think 90% or more of the abuse has stopped? it started getting better 2 years ago and now our relationship is actually pretty good. she still manipulates me and abuses me verbally sometimes maybe once every few months and she hits me like once a year. 
i tried to change everything about me around her and play by her shitty rules to try to please as much as possible so i guess that's working but it's still very weird yk. like is she a bad mother or a good mother. i feel bad calling her a bad mother especially because she's always took care of me and was nice a lot.

agh4g0,I'm not sure if this is abuse.,"Throwaway account because others know my actual one.

So I live mostly with my mom and stepdad. My mom and I have arguments at times, but my stepdad and I have never really gotten along. Mostly, I try to avoid him. Today I was having an argument with my mom about how I needed wifi to do my homework (I'm in high school). My mom had moved the router from where it has always been plugged in and I was arguing with her about how I needed it to finish an essay, however she wanted me to just take the 0. Either way, my stepdad butted in and told me to ""get the fuck out"", and how this was ""his house"" and he decides what goes on in it. Firstly, I'm 17, so I can't get a place to stay by myself.  I would also like to say that my mom and I have been living in that house far longer than he has, and it is in almost no way ""his house"". Well, I told him that I was not going to leave, and then he got up, grabbed me, and threw me against the wall, and then again. I ended up with just a bloody nose. He's never been physical with me before. I was also part of the problem as I was in a heated mood during an argument. I was in no way physical with him, and kind of went into shock afterwards. I don't really know what to think of all this, or what to do about it.

Last night I was lying in bed and trying to think back to the past, which I don't like to do, and I remembered some stuff. I do not think this counts as abuse mind, just a weird experience.

I remembered my older sister who must of been about 14 telling me about sex and what not when I was about 8. I remember her telling me to masturbate and how to do it and stuff. At that age I had no interest in this but tried any how. I feel like the world of sex and pornography was pushed on me far too young.

I also remembered sitting with my sister and her older male friends and her telling the boys that I madturbated every night, not true, but almost as a boast or in a way to show off.

aglp33,Does anyone else feel like a child with their abuser?,"TLDR below

I (F17) dated a guy when I was 13. He was abusive and manipulative, and I had so many mental disorders in addition to that. I was obsessed with getting his validation. He would hurt me verbally, sometimes physically, but I would still go out of my way to get his approval (how I ate, dressed, talked, etc). 

Fast forward to today, I’m now 17, and have been dating a guy for almost 2.5 years now. He knows about my history with my ex. I still have nightmares about him, and I can’t talk about him in therapy, but he lives in a different city, and we never cross paths, so it’s mostly fine.

Except he started talking to me again recently. And he’s changed. He’s a feminist, he’s kind, he’s there for me when I need him. He’s often been there when I’m having panic attacks and/or am depressed. 

Everytime I talk to him, I feel like I’m still in love with him. I border on emotional infidelity (two nights ago, I practically crossed that line), and once he’s gone, I’m back to being myself. When I talk to him, I feel like I’m 13 again. Like an attention-deprived validation-seeking lovestruck girl, who’d do anything for him. I feel small and needy, and I keep needing his comfort and approval. I’m not myself. When he leaves my life over and over, it feels like I’ve broken up with him all over again. It’s devastating, and it’s hurting my boyfriend too. He’s trying to be supportive, but I can’t keep doing this to him. 

Am I crazy, or does this happen to someone else too?

agn7qj,"I need advice, and a place to tell my story","Hey guys! Even before I was born my dad was abusive of my mum and my older sister. I don't really remember if he ever did anything to me as a baby but from the age of 4 I was emotionally, sexually, and physically abused by my dad. My mum and sister too. At the age of 9 I was raped, my sister way raped twice (7 and 11) and my mum was raped too many times to count ( I found out recently that I was a product of rape). I was hit, starved, overfed, and locked away. I was told I was a whore, a skank, even though I got perfect marks in school I was told I was a idiot and a failure. The abuse finally stopped when I was 12, I coerced my mum into finally calling the police, my dad was arrested and taken away, and it was just me, my mum, and my sister. My dad had cut off all of the family on my mum's side, through long periods of manipulation, but my mum managed and eventually she found another man, Michael. Michael has been wonderful, he never shouts or loses his temper with my mother, I now have a beautiful little brother called Callan who I love with all my heart, and everyone seems genuinely happy. That is, except me, I never told my mum what my dad had done to me, because she'd always thought I was daddy's little girl and had never been hurt. So, to not upset her, I never told her the truth. Michael, though we have our ups and downs, if frequently emotionally abusive, and extremely strict towards me. Mainly without my mum's knowledge. I am only 13, only a year on from my dad, I can manage Michael, I've been through worse, but I can't go on like this forever, what do I do?

agynst,I Spent Most of My Teens Thinking It Was My Fault. This is My Story,"TLDR at the bottom

I have recently been sharing my story and I thought here would be a good place. I don't want to hear how strong I am or how sorry anyone is. This is a part of me that I have to live with and that is all I see it as. 

Here are my short forms so no one gets lost!
B is my sister
K is my mom
M is my mom's husband (the abuser, not my biodad)
C is my brother

In hindsight I see the abuse started much earlier than I thought as a teen. Probably around age 8 or 9 M started wearing down my self confidence and worth. Looks were a very big deal in my house so I was often told I looked ugly or fat (when I was skinny as a rail). It was common in my house to hear M say ""look at the rack on [insert name]. That's hot!"" Basically that was a daily occurrence. 

Skip ahead a year or two and M started bursting into the washroom while I was showering, about age 9-10. I was very uncomfortable with this and let him know that but it continued anyway. I couldn't lock him out either since there were 2 washroom doors- one through the hallway and one through the master bedroom. I tried to lock the doors and the bedroom door but M kept a key to them with him and if I locked the door he would dump cups of ice on me. I couldn't even get away by showering while he was at work because he worked from home. 

By age 12 I was use to this. It was a daily occurrence of me being called fat, not getting to shower without being intruded on. I was constantly angry. That year we moved to a new house but in the same school district, this is important later. Now we had 2 bathrooms and M couldn't  invade my shower anymore. I thought this was over. I was wrong. 

At 13 I was getting ready for high school. There was a program K came across that she thought I would benefit from. The catch is it was at a school across town, which meant leaving all my friends. I was told I had to apply. I got in and was told I was going to that school and even though we moved to be able to stay at the school we were at I now had to start a new school with no one I knew.

Still at 13 M had taken an interest in my sexuality. I am straight and never wavered from thinking that. I had 1 really close friend who I hung out with pretty much every day. Since she is also female M would constantly berate us and insist we must be lesbians- neither of us are- and he wouldn't let up on it.

So at age 13 I was told I couldn't go to school with my friends anymore, was constantly being called fat still (at 5'4 and 85lbs), and being told I had to be a lesbian because I was close friends with another girl. It wasn't a great year for me. 

By the time I turned 14 and was starting high school M had started molesting me at every chance he could. His office was the 3rd floor of the house and basically everyone stayed on the first floor so despite my screaming for help no one could hear me. Eventually he started threatening me that I didn't stop screaming he would make me stop. I tried everything to make him stop- calling him a pedophile, fighting back- but remember I am tiny- etc, but I quickly realized it was futile because he wouldn't stop. I thought K knew what was happening so I never brought it up to her. I was also afraid if M stopped with me he may start with B and I was not willing to trade her safety for mine. In my eyes I was already damaged and she wasn't so I wanted to protect her. 

At 15 M tried to make me switch to the closer high school because ""it's too expensive to have to go across town every day"" I convinced K to let me stay instead of having to be isolated again. In hindsight I see M was trying another way to wear me down and isolate me further. 

At 16 K confronted me about being angry all the time. I told her what M was doing and she tried to get him to stop. K persuaded me not to report this to the police since M owns his own business and we could go bankrupt if I did. I never reported him but I did start staying with my dad half the time. 

Several years later K left M because she could no longer stand being around him (he was emotionally and financially abusive towards her for the entire 20 years they were married). C and B still went to see M occasionally. C was 16 when M and  C had a big blow up. M blamed C for K leaving and C broke a picture so M pushed C through a wall. Clearly at that point M had not changed and C went nearly 2 years without talking to M. 

Fast forward to November 2018. M confronts me about not having seen him since my daughter was born in August 2018. I tell M I can't let my girl be anywhere near him and he knows exactly why. M tries to guilt trip me into seeing him but I refuse. 

If you've made it this far, thank you for reading and letting me share. I am married with 3 kids (2 boys and a girl) and my biggest regret is trying to make K's life easier by allowing M to meet my boys and occasionally seeing him. My husband agrees we shouldn't have done this as well. My heart aches because if something had happened to them I would never forgive myself. 

TL;DR 
My abuser started abusing me at 8 and this continued until I was 16 and basically moved out. I ended up being pretty normal all things considered. I hope my story can shed some light that things can get better and they will with therapy and time.",lovinitup93,2019-01-17 07:09:04,7,1088,27.94,30,81.91,13.36,17,13.6,90.72,58.55,19.21,14.8,10.2,0.83,0.18,3.22,0.37,4.41,3.95,12.78,11.4,5.24,7.35,2.67,21.51,4.6,1.84,0.83,3.03,1.56,4.69,1.84,2.76,0.37,1.19,0.55,9.83,0.92,0.37,1.84,2.85,11.86,1.65,1.93,2.48,2.39,1.65,3.22,1.93,1.19,0.55,0.18,1.38,0.64,0.74,0.28,0.28,8.27,2.11,1.38,2.94,1.29,1.01,9.93,6.99,0.55,17.1,2.39,7.9,7.54,1.84,0.09,1.47,0.64,0,0,1.29,0,1.1,0.74,0.09,0.09,10.57,5.61,0.92,0,0.09,0,0.18,0.64,0.37,1.65,0.92,0.18
agz7p0,Do abusers actually realize theyre abusers?,"I'm not sure this is the right sub and this is kind of a strange question, but growing up I was raised by narcissistic parents and experienced some abuse (seldom physical). Now that I'm in my first real relationship I'm paranoid I'm abusing my girlfriend. I try to identify the behaviors and change and be different. Like how we approach problems and how I react when she's upset with me but I'm worried I can't identify all the behaviors. The only way I can relieve myself is by thinking ""abusers don't realize they're abusers"" and by identifying these problems with myself I'm not actually an abuser but just have abusive tendencies due to poor upbringing. Should I see a counselor and ask if I need help or not? 
 
Generally what I consider abusive on my part is:

• Lashing out during arguments (I've improved on this)
• acting nonchalant about things I've done like it isn't a big deal

Its just hard to fix these behaviors when they're my immediate go to's. I would never ever harm my girlfriend no matter how angry I am, I've never been violent towards anything. Is there a way for me to keep myself in check? Whenever I broach the subject of me being a possible abuser to my girlfriend she just says ""no you're not it's fine don't worry about it"" or something else to try to dismiss the thought but I'm insanely paranoid of hurting her. What are some ways I can try to curb these behaviors?  

Tl;dr: I've noticed some abusive behaviors in myself and want to change them

Essential questions I have:

• should I see a counselor?
• how can I stop acting this way before it begins in heated situations
• how can I actively work on these issues?

—

I’m sorry in advance for this long shit story. 

I am 18(m). I’ve spent the better part of 5 months in the hospital. Now that I’m home my father does weird things to me as punishment for being sick and a “pussy.” 

I was admitted to the hospital after starting college in the fall. I had internal bleeding from inflammatory bowel disease (Crohns). I got septic shock, was on a ventilator in the ICU, and almost died. I was in the hospital for the next several months. I dropped out of college and moved home to my parents house in December and was readmitted. Been out of the hospital for ~10 days now. 

My dad has no concern for me. He calls me every name he can think of and yells at me to not show any weakness, as if I didn’t already know this. He is irate because of the medical bills. I want to work but I do not feel good enough yet. 

He controls my every move. I can only sleep when he does, 6-7 hours a day even though I have needed 14-20 hours daily since I’ve been sick. He wakes me at 6 AM and calls constantly throughout the day to make sure I’m being productive—chores, errands, job applications (which I have to show him when he gets home). It takes every ounce of energy in every cell in my body to do these things. Sometimes he comes home during lunch to make sure I’m not sleeping. When he gets home later he hits me (not hard) every 30 seconds to wake me up because I can’t stop falling asleep on the couch. I often can’t go to bed until midnight, long after I’m ready.  

He is obsessed with my bathroom habits. If I get up to use the toilet he pins me down and steps on my stomach. He won’t let me go until I beg him for several minutes. He does this even though he knows I have a lot of pain and urgency from my disease. On Monday I did not make it to the bathroom in time because of him. He also bangs on the door if I’m taking too long or intrudes and gives me no privacy. He laughs when he does these things. 

My meds haven’t worked so far, but I am hopeful about my current one. When my symptoms are not controlled I have a fever daily for weeks at a time, chills and aches, internal bleeding, vomiting, extreme fatigue, diarrhea, and other details I will spare you. I am on an IV 12 hours a day that puts food directly into my veins (called TPN) because my body can’t absorb nutrients properly. I’m not supposed to leave the house without a medical mask because my immune system is shot. All I want to do is sleep. 

Sometimes I feel like I’m crazy and that I’m faking my illness or just seeking attention. I feel guilty and worthless and can see why my father hates me. I internalize what he says to me to such an extent that I am too ashamed to even admit when I’m tired. This has resulted in pretending that I’m ok until I’m in a medical emergency. It has been a huge internal struggle but now I at least realize why I do this to myself. 

He is not evil. He used to physically abuse my mom and me when I was little but he got help with his drinking problem and started being an OK father. He is drinking again and is under financial stress but more importantly is still dealing with the death of my older brother, who was killed three years ago when he was 18. On the day we found out my father told me never to cry about it. But I know it affected him because I heard him crying a few times when he thought he was alone. My family does not talk about my brother, ever. I think my dad resents me because my brother was killed instead of me. These are the only things I can think of to explain why he is like this. I have tried to prove myself to him my whole life and was successful at school, sports, and in my social life. 

No one knows that this is happening. I can’t seem to make myself talk to anyone about it and anyway my dad said he would kick me out of the house if I tell anyone. A stranger on reddit has helped me through the past few months and I am grateful to her.

I told you all of this shit because I need to know how I can get through to my dad without sounding like a baby. I am starting to feel sicker again because of the stress and cannot overstate how tired I am. I just want to sleep. Hopefully I am going back to college in the fall and just need to make it work with him until then. 

Tl;dr:  My Dad torments me because I am sick. He has his own issues but he does not understand what I’m going through right now. I need to know how to get through to him without sounding like a baby.",bobjim723,2019-01-17 08:10:20,11,941,25.72,14.39,87.29,3.48,15.18,13.39,94.05,60.47,21.36,17.43,12.75,0.11,0.21,4.36,0,3.93,4.25,13.71,9.99,6.06,7.76,2.87,18.38,3.83,1.49,2.13,1.49,1.81,5.31,1.49,3.83,0.64,1.06,0.64,9.25,1.91,0,0.21,5.63,13.6,2.76,3.08,1.7,2.13,1.38,4.25,1.81,0.32,0.74,0.74,5.74,1.7,3.83,0.11,0.43,4.89,1.06,0.85,1.7,1.38,0.32,4.46,14.13,0.85,14.13,1.59,5.1,7.12,1.49,0.74,1.59,0.32,0,0.43,1.06,0.32,0.32,0.21,0,0.21,13.28,6.48,1.91,0.11,0.11,0,0,0.32,0.21,2.55,1.28,0.32

ah4g56,How do I get away when no one will believe me.,"Throwaway here because my mum reads all my emails. I had long detailed post but I did it with low power and lost it and it took a lot out of me so here’s the abridged version. My mum has way to much control over my life and has isolated me and sleep deprived me for years by trying to manipulate me. She uses me for my disability befits and bus pass.

She rarely sympathises when I’m sick and often actively exacerbates it. As a child she did things like make me clean up my vomit while I was still vomiting. I haven’t been to the doctors in a decade except two times the school made me and that’s where something I can’t confirm comes in. No one has ever believed me that I’m sick. My primary once literally gave me in trouble for saying I was going to be sick and then was shocked when I was actually sick. The same thing happened and my scouts. My grandparents occasionally call me a hypochondriac despite the fact I never tell people I’m ill because I know I won’t be believed. The two times I’ve went to the doctor I’ve been not believed dispirit the fact I’m nearly at the stage of collapse. The thing that really flagged up that it was exceptionally weird that no one ever believes me was at a camp.

Now I can’t go into the camp because it take an eon to explain is I went to a camp I’d went to the year previously and I was sure it would help me recover from a person in authority trying and almost succeeding to ruin my life (not getting into it). Basically a bunch more traumatic stuff went down (that is so bad I tell no one because I know people will think I’m making it up and I’m done with being not believed or called a bummer for bringing up horrible stuff) but and no one in a possession of authority believed me or did anything (male and female) and one of them let slip she believed I had clinical paranoia (I have Asperger’s) I said no I don’t why would you think that and she claimed I said it in the canoe, she back-tracked and apologised. There was also an event earlier where I had fainted from not having eaten in 6 hours while climbing a monroe and the leader said he’d send me home in the same was as he said to people who faked illness to get out of the horrible camp.

Right now I’m getting over the same illness I usually have. My mum told me to drink spirits and paracetamol to help. (I’m 18 in the UK) and this got me wondering why this recurring problem has never been properly looked into . As a child they went back and forth on me having asthma but they’d never help and me asking for an inhaler made people disbelieve even more. My mum still gets the repeat inhaler despite the fact I haven’t used them in 5 years.

I’m worried I either have an unaddressed condition or if she’s actually doing something to me and I pray it’s the former. 

She’s definitely a kleptomaniac not usually for expensive things but incredibly cheap things. I’m pretty sure she even has me take stuff out unknowingly some times. A don’t want to be complicit to a crime but I don’t think I’d even be believed as I have no proof and I’m used to no one believing me including the police. 

She’s implied in the past she’ll get me institutionalised if I tell anyone how she treats me, she says if I go to my grandparents and tell them I’ll stress them out and it will be my fault they die

I don’t need sympathy, I don’t even need anyone to believe me since I know Reddit is a highly skeptical place. I need solutions. I can’t go on living like this but I’m not allowed a job by my mum and she has compete control of my life. 

I’m 18 and so won’t get benefits. I’m disabled so I skip town they might still treat it like a run away and I still have to or to University . All my friends are gone as I’ve lost the ability to be funny or find things funny so I guess I’m not worth keeping around now that everyone is at uni. I get so little sleep I’m sure to fall behind and if I get kicked out I have nothing to live for.

My mum says she’ll get me a house with all her life’s savings if I get into 2nd year but I don’t think I can last that long and then what. I have a legally binding contract that I’m in debt to her and if I skip town I’m breaking the law. Also she always promises and never delivers she once took a toy skeleton horse off me because it was £10 why should I even believe the house isn’t a fantasy to stop me complaining for 7+ months. 

All I want is to choose when I go outside when I want and eat what I want and go to bed when I want. 

I’m not a rebellious person I didn’t even resist in any way when she tackled me to the ground and dragged me back into our house ate she threw something and I tried to reach my granparents. It’s not like I’m unable I’m strong and a black belt at karate. An activity that was solely so she could meet other mums of autistic children and micromanage there kids. I half respected them until I figured out half of them are anti-vaxxers and wanting to push CBD oil on others kids.


And my mum isn’t ""dumb"" either she has a masters in autism and like 3 degrees in things related to social work. And like 5 HNC/D’s. She’s no longer a social worker.


Going to get a bit TMI I’m super sorry if this is the wrong sub for this but I don’t know how to look up symptoms. I always wet a weird swooshing in my right ear that sounds like a swoosh transition, I have balance issues and find it tend to happen when I blink or move to much. A lot of flem comes out from what feels like my lungs and progressively has more and more blood intense coughing when I do have the other symptoms and intense sneezing when I don’t. Period every 3 - 5 months and it’s incredibly light. Singing drastically between dehydration and over hydration, nausea, fluctuating between hot and cold. I am overweight because my mum has compete controls over my diet and activity levels thou I know I shouldn’t make excuses if that helps with figuring out what’s wrong. Won’t be able to go to a GP for at least two weeks
 
Theirs more but that’s the main stuff. If this is a common cold or allergies don’t be afraid to say I’d be super relieved.

ah5k2s,Why do I miss my abusive ex?,"I have been broken up with my abusive ex (I'll just refer to him as ""X"") for about 4 years. I am now engaged and have a completely different life now.   


I just finished watching ""YOU"" on Netflix, and the whole time, the main character (Joe) reminded me of X ( he even looks like him a little bit ). The show was triggering to me but I also couldn't stop watching it. The more I watched, the more I couldn't stop thinking about X. I was almost rooting for Joe, hoping he would be happy in the end with the girl that he was stalking/manipulating. I found myself defending his actions in my head.   


The past few days, I've been reflecting on my relationship with X. He did horrible things to me and ruined my sense of self worth, but I think I'm kind of looking back on our relationship and romanticizing it a little bit? I think ""YOU"" made me see things from a different perspective. Like, X thought everything he did was justified. He did it because he loved me so passionately that he didn't want other people to have a part in that. He thought he was protecting me. I think I find some sort of comfort in trauma because I had a messy childhood; turmoil has always had a place in my life so it feels normal.   


I have been looking for old interactions between us. I have deleted/destroyed almost everything from that relationship because it was so toxic. I would never, ever, want to be with him again. But part of me is yearning for some sort of interaction with him. I feel guilty and dirty because of it. *Why am I feeling like this, and what can I do to make it stop?*",rosesandbuds,2019-01-17 18:12:18,4,306,21.44,35.95,55.93,7.13,14.57,17.32,96.08,62.75,24.18,18.3,12.09,0.65,0.65,4.9,0,5.88,4.9,12.75,11.76,6.54,5.88,1.31,20.26,4.25,2.61,0.98,0.33,3.27,6.21,2.29,3.92,0.98,0.98,0.98,10.78,0,0,0.33,4.9,17.97,5.23,3.92,2.61,2.61,1.96,2.29,3.92,2.61,0,0.98,1.96,0.33,0.98,0.33,0,5.56,2.94,0,0.98,0,1.63,6.86,9.8,0.65,9.8,0.33,4.25,5.56,0,0.33,0,0.33,0,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,17.65,5.88,3.27,0,0.33,0.98,0,0,1.96,1.96,1.96,1.31
ah7n6s,Am i crazy?,"Guys, I need some insight. I'm fairly young (20) and I think I'm in an abusive relationship. Emotionally, not physically. My friends say I am. So, a brief history.

 We got together four years ago. Two of those years was spent with him constantly talking to his ex and planning to meet up with her. I'd find out, freak out, and it would stop for a month. Then, he broke up with me because I wouldn't have sex with him. I was 16/17 and have PTSD. I was doing my best. He goes on rants about how I'm a whore and I was never raped and I'm not mentally ill- I just fake it. Well, I dated his friend after asking permission. His friend breaks up with me because he's moving.

 My boyfriend and I get back together. He plays video games, ignores me, tells me I can't do what I want (cut my hair/talk to certain people) and yells at me for having a drug problem. However, his friend and my ex tells me he loves me a year into it. I cheated emotionally and for a little bit and break up with him. Now, this is when it gets crazy. When I do that, he texts my mom (who is abusive 100% and another story) and tells her where I am (I was at a party) and who I'm with (my best friend and ex). He tells everyone I was fucking this guy for years (untrue) and all sorts of lies. Tells me he wants his ring back, and that I wouldn't have anything if it wasn't for him. He tells me he cheated on me before we broke up the first time with his friend. Starts drinking heavily and blaming on me, tells me he can't live without me. We're back together again right now and nothing is better. He doesn't care if I'm not into sex(because ""I know what you need"" and if I say no ""you need convincing"") he doesn't respect me(orders me to shower/get ready/etc, gropes me in front of friends, refers to me as ""bitch"" and ""slut""), etc. I've tried to talk to him and rebuild trust but nothing works. I'm scared of this escalating. If I do decide to leave, my mother will kick me out and cut all ties with me. I'm trying to get my license to get some sort of Independence  I know I haven't been perfect, or even completely fair, but he just doesn't seem to grasp he has to work for us. 

Tl;dr - boyfriend and I have been together 4 years, it's been a very toxic rollercoaster and friends say I'm being mentally abused (his friends too) and I don't know if I should leave or even how because I'll be kicked out. Are we toxic to each other? Are we both abusive?

ah8st7,I (30F) have no idea how to bring up past abuse from father to partner (33M),"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and a half and in a few months will be looking for a home together. We are very much in love and are on the way to marriage and kids in the next few years. 

My father and I have a better relationship now but when I was 6-10 I would stay at my dad's every second weekend and he would watch porn with me, he even took me into sketchy places to buy more. I became far too sexually aware at such a young age and I've gone through a lot to get a better idea of what real love and sex is. As I was so young I had no idea what we were watching together. 

When I was 18 I faced my father, he apologised genuinely (had a full mental breakdown after I turned 10, went to jail (which my partner knows))

He and I have genuinely worked through this and we have a fairly good relationship considering. 

My partner has met my father because I wanted him to meet my dad without anger or full judgement.

But now I have no idea how to talk about it or when. I want to tell him because I don't want to have secrets but I don't want him to hate my father either as he is a part of my life, albeit small.

I'm better now, avoiding depression spells if I can by sleeping. I'm turning 17 soon, looking for a job that balances between my crippling anxiety and my chronic spraining back. My dad's temper settled out, and even though things are bad he's been treating me better, although my brother is still favored, I don't like the attention, and he's respected my wishes for no physical affection. I'm seeing a therapist too.
Thank you, those who commented on that day that helped me with my concerns and made me feel a little more sane in the way I felt.
I haven't and will never forgive my dad, and I don't love him like I did when I was a naieve child who took thrashings and stood until I let my legs give out, or was held by my hair and fed a small amount of dishsoap.

My parents have neglected me as a small child and abused me verbally and physically ever since this day.

I work a lot, around 40 till 55 hours a week. I work as a beginning social worker, with people with aggression issues and a mental handicap.

I got no place to call home, so I work as much as I can to stay away from home and to earn money.

I sleep in the car some nights to avoid being at home. I am slowly getting a trauma for the dark, I get anxiety attacks.


My boyfriend of 7 months knows all of this and is a sweet heart. He's a tough guy who's also been through a lot.


Now he's moved places, further away from me, into a big house with a lot of space. With a friend he's only known for a month.


I tasted the taste of freedom, safety and a chance at a better paging job. My instincts were to ask if I could move in.

The new friend said no.. Even tho he knew about my issues. Which really made my self worth issues worse.. I feel like even the people who have luck and are living a good life don't find me worth helping.


My boyfriend would want me there but is also scared that it might not go well...

I feel so depressed and in despair, in need for help. I could taste the relief, but a guy ive only known recently decided I wasn't worth the shot.


I just want tips on what to do.

ahdqks,"My older brother has an anger problem, I’m not sure if it counts as abuse, I just need some help.","I don’t know where else to post this. This is one of the only websites I know where you can directly get help and advice, and I’ve never had an account here so I just made one about 5 minutes ago and am now posting this. I just don’t know what to do, or who to tell or say and I don’t know if it even counts as abuse or anything.

Okay. I’m 16-years-old. My brother is 17-years-old. We get along sometimes, or used to, but he has a real bad anger problem. When we were little kids he’d hit me or we’d get mad at each other and I’d cry, but we were little kids and little kids have hard times controlling anger.

As we grew up he’d punch me in the arm sometimes and it’d hurt,  but nothing that would cause alarm. After I turned fourteen it kind of stopped...until a year later.

Since I started going to his High School, I’ve noticed that he’s just really angry at me more often and I don’t like to hang out with him. Sometimes he’ll be nice but not usually. He has an anger problem, but my Mom or Dad won’t acknowledge it, and they give us way too much room without rules. Also he’s usually the “funny man” so you wouldn’t really expect him to be super angry.

He lies a lot. I know this, but my parents don’t. He likes to call me a snitch but I keep way more shit under my belt than he realizes. I know he gets drunk with his friends on the weekends, and I KNOW he’s vaping, (which a tone of kids do these days, I guess), and he’s sleeping with this girl and one time he drove me home from school high off shitty weed. I have never said any of this.

It started when I was a Freshman. He plays his music REALLY loud, and I mean really. I don’t really want to listen to that in the mornings. I didn’t freak out, I swear to god. He tells me I do but I know I don’t. Not at first. I told him to turn it down, he ignored me. I told him I was fine with it loud to a degree, but if it’s so loud I can’t even hear my own headphones, that’s not fair. He didn’t listen. I reached over to turn the music down, and he slapped my hand away. Hard. That’s never happened before. I kind of recoiled and asked him why he did that. He got upset, rolled his eyes, called me an idiot and “fucking crazy”. We kept driving.

I didn’t complain about his radio again until he drove me home from softball hitting practice when my Dad couldn’t. This time it wasn’t normal loud, it was ear splitting. He hadn’t started driving yet when I told him I REALLY did not want to do this tonight. I was tired, and just wanted to drive home quietly. I again reached for the thing, and I remember him yelling, and getting pissed way faster. He said something like it was a joke but he didn’t look like he was joking. I pulled out my phone to call my Dad, and he slapped my across the face and tried to grab the phone. I managed to get it away and started crying. I finally got my Dad on the phone and he’d turned the music down considerably. I tried to replay the events but couldn’t because I was crying so much. My Dad told me to stop because I could get us into an accident. My brother told my Dad how badly I was freaking out, how I had no idea what I was talking about. He likes he phrase, “I never hit her!” When we got home my Dad told my brother to turn his music down next time, and I just went into my room mad. Later that night my brother mad me laugh, and I guess that was his apology. I didn’t think about it.

We had fights like this a few more times, but none of them got as bad as calling my Dad. I usually ended up crying. He called me a psycho, told me I’m “on edge” and “agitated” all the time. I never know how to respond or what to say, so I just don’t.

Our most recent fight was about an hour ago. I’d just calmed down, but my hands are still shaking a bit. I went downstairs to make my lunch. His PS4 was turned on, but my brother was in the shower and he wasn’t in the middle of playing any sort of game. I turned it off correctly, turned on the tv and turned on a movie which I was watching as I started to make a stupid sand which. He walked out, gave me a strange look, and walked over to the tv to change to back to his game.

I NEVER get to use the tv because of this, and I’ve never called him out for it. This time I was legitimately in the middle of watching a movie, and I was done. I said no, no, no. But he was already clicking buttons on the tv to turn the HLM or whatever it’s called back to the PS4. So I walked over and got in between him and the buttons. I told him to find something else to do, he’s been playing for weeks, and all I wanted to do was watch a stupid movie. IT IS LITERALLY THE STUPIDEST FIGHT EVER. HE COULD’VE JUST WALKED BACK INTO HIS ROOM.

But no. He started getting mad. I can’t remember exactly what he said, but I could tell he was getting agitated. He continually fake-hit me. I flinched a couple times, because I thought he actually would. He laughed at me for flinching and I said, “You’ve actually hit me before!” Which is when he got a really angry face, and punched me hard in my arm knocking me backwards. I hit the back of my foot on a cabinet.

I kind of stared at him for a second. I’m still surprised. I don’t know how to describe it, but there was a knot in my throat and my breath was really hard and I wanted to cry but I couldn’t. He told me to calm down like he was acting crazy. I ran to go find my phone and said I was calling Dad. I called him insane. I didn’t know what else to say. He does this thing where he tries to act like everything’s a joke, and was half-laughing when he tried to take the phone away. I think he was trying to brush everything off. I still had the remote and went to my room. He followed me to grab the remote. I dropped it and it broke on the floor, and he picked it up and called me crazy. I called my Dad, I was breathing heavily and crying and I couldn’t get many sentences out but I told him what happened. He was angry, said he was driving home.

I sat in my room until my Dad got home. I yelled at my brother, who profusely denied everything. My Dad went upstairs and asked me, I showed him my arm which was still red. My Dad went downstairs to yell at my brother again, who KEPT denying it until my Dad said “Well if neither of you can figure this out then both of you stay in your rooms the rest of today.” My brother didn’t like this either. He was really upset. He kept yelled, “I DIDN’T HIT HER!” I have never heard him this angry. He slammed against the table, and my Dad was just sitting at his desk holding his head. I told me Dad, “See!” I said he had anger problem. He called me crazy again. Said I was always on edge and agitated, again. He said he never hit me. I asked him if he remembered slapping me in the car. He said, “WHAT? I never hit you!!” He kept telling this to my Dad until my Dad screamed at both of us to go back into our rooms.

ahevj0,How to Ignore My Brother's Verbal Abuse?,"Hey so I've been going through a lot recently and suffer from anxiety and depression. As a kid, my brother used to physically abuse me such as punch me until I had a bloody nose and broke both my arms as a kid. When it first started, my parents tried to intervene but after a while they stopped and just let him beat me. As a grew older, he pretty much stopped beating me up but continues to verbally abuse me. He also verbally abuses my parents. I'm 20 and still live with my parents and while my brother has moved out, he comes over every day. 

His verbal abuse has gotten so bad that my sleep schedule has gotten messed up and I sleep in until 4 pm or 5 pm just to avoid him. I'm trying to change my sleep schedule but it's hard since if I try to get up in the morning or afternoon, he's here and starts verbally abusing me. I'm in therapy right now to address my anxiety and depression as well as the abuse. My therapist has tried to tell my parents that my brother is abusive but they are in denial and will not help or tell him that he can't come over to my house. I'm trying to get a job right now but it's been extremely hard finding one as I have no job experience. I also have no other family or friends I can stay with unless I want to go down to a shelter. 

I'm wondering how do I ignore or tune out his constant verbal abuse? I try just staying in my room but my room is extremely small, cold and uncomfortable. He makes my mental health so much worse and I really want to change my sleep schedule, but it's hard with him verbally abusing me every time he sees me.",spazmcgee1,2019-01-18 12:52:27,1,322,19.64,14.55,95.78,1,20.12,14.29,95.03,57.76,20.19,17.7,13.04,0,0,4.04,0.62,2.48,3.11,13.66,8.07,6.21,13.98,1.24,18.63,5.28,3.42,0.93,1.55,1.86,7.76,0.62,7.14,1.24,3.11,1.24,9.63,2.8,0.31,0,5.28,12.11,0.62,2.17,0.93,4.04,1.24,5.59,2.48,0.31,0.31,1.24,3.73,2.17,1.55,0,0,11.8,3.42,2.48,3.73,1.24,1.55,4.35,13.98,0.62,17.08,3.11,6.52,8.07,1.55,0.31,1.55,0,0,0,0.93,0.31,0,0,0.31,0,10.87,4.35,2.17,0,0,0.62,0,0,0,3.73,0,0

ahf1ff,Help us please,"Please any ideas or help...

My son was basically kidnapped from me and I’m lost. 

He has been abused by his mother for years, told he is a loser , dumb and that he should just kill himself., as well as some physical abuse and reports of being locked in his room without food. The same types of abuse that I suffered from for years and left her over.

Recently, after receiving death threats from his mother as well as harassment and threats from her friends (which happen to be law enforcement) that if I do anything to interfere with custody I’ll never be seen or heard from again, I moved to a new state.

After much legal work, My son came here to visit and when he refused to go back to his mother we received a protective order in our new state as well as custody order to protect us from her.

Her state fired back w threats to file felony charges against me if I didn’t return him. I was legally covered in my state however my son not wanting me to get in to trouble then threatened to either run away or take his life if he was made to go back. 

His school called local police who had him signed in to local psych ward where his mother showed up one day and took him back to her state. Her court ruled against me saying hat I was alienating my son from his mother and stripped me of my rights now 
I have not talked to him since October when it happened and I have tried everything.

We need so much help but first things first
1/22 is his bday and I would give anything just to tell him I love him and happy bday 
I worry about him and don’t even know if he’s ok 

Lots of help needed ...

ahhoy5,Would you read this book? This would be the first couple of pages. Exposing abuse,"THE BEGINNING

    When it started, I didn’t know what was going on, I couldn’t imagine the fate that I was being groomed for, and even after it began, I wouldn’t be able to see it clearly until the very end. It is often hard to believe that someone can intentionally abuse or mistreat you, it’s even harder to imagine that they can cultivate an entire plan that has an end goal of controlling you and centering the universe on them and their desires. Because of this we find ourselves in disbelief and are often left with one question,  “Does he know what he is doing?”.
    The honest truth, is that the behaviors that are often exhibited by abusers aren’t so cut and dry. Just as when we pout a little extra to illicit more sympathy from a loved one when we are hurt, Narcissistic   abusers manipulate us into situations where our actions satisfy some selfish need that they have, regardless of their effect on us. 
    Abuse doesn’t start with a slap here and there like Hollywood shows, no, sometimes you’ll never even know its happening, until it is too late. Sometimes the deepest wounds aren’t inflicted with the fist but with words, actions, and manipulations. Many of us survive the worst forms of psychological torment and don’t even recognize it as abuse because we are too busy trying to keep out heads above water and see through the mental fog that has somehow accumulated in our minds.
     I want to share my story, and I go through it with you, I will stop and examine how the Narcissistic abuse begins, progresses, cycles, and how someone on the receiving end of the abuse perceives it. The reason why the perception of the abuse may in fact be the most important component of this book, is because psychological and emotional abuse is difficult for victims to identify. Many people ask, “Why does she put up with that?” or “Why did she stay so long,” others may state how they would never accept such treatment. The problem is, it never starts out that way, not at all.
     It starts with a girl, a girl who doesn’t know her worth, a girl who is desperate to prove that she has value both to herself and to the “one"". She may not even be aware of her desperate need for validation, telling herself that she just wants a partner, someone with whom to spend her life. It starts with a date.
     She had arrived to the restaurant 20 minutes early, she was excited to be going out with what looked like an attractive and well traveled guy. So she waited, butterflies gathering in her stomach as the clock neared 8pm. Buzz. Five till Eight and a text arrived, he's running a half hour late… that’s ok, she doesn’t mind, she is already there, she can wait. 8:30 comes around and so does a second text, he so sorry hell be there in another 20 minutes, sure she's a little embarrassed but she really wants to meet him, so waiting a little longer wont kill her. 
    Finally, this time her phone rings and its him trying to find her table. So, she stands to greet him, and the date finally begins. He's a little short but very polite, and they have so much in common, yet he doesn't seem too interested in her. What’s going on? He sounded like he really liked her on the phone. Is she not pretty enough? Maybe she should try a little harder, pursue him just a tad. By the end of the date she feels like it’s a bust, until he invites her back to his place for a drink. She immediately accepts feeling the need to “win” him over. 
     The beginning of my story has a few red flags, some of which I didn’t see until I began to write it down. We could chalk his excessive lateness up to being a bit rude, but as my story progresses it seems less and less plausible. The honest to God truth is that I was being tested from the moment he decided to meet me. Having me wait on me for him to arrive served two purposes. Firstly, it made it obvious how interested I was and gave him an idea of how “understanding” I may be in the future. Secondly, it shifted  our roles of who was pursuing who. With this shift of roles it also set a tone for the future relationship, he was the desirable one to be warned and waited upon and I was the won who needed to work for and wait on him. The second red flag is also a common trait of Narcissism, it is that the Narcissistic individual will emulate the person with whom they are with to try and win them over through an instant “connection"" . This connection, is really just the Narcissist mirroring yourself back at you. You love to read? Well, he just finished a great book this week! This combined with the pulling away and acting somewhat disinterested so that they are the ones to be pursued and marked as high value makes a lethal combination. 
     Then, when he invited me over for a drink after the meal; of course, I had to jump at the opportunity, he was such a great catch, and he gave me another chance to make him interested in me. That night, I drove to his house with a fierce determination to win him over. Little did I know, he had already won the game and I was just a mouse caught in his trap. 
     She arrived at his apartment that night, her heart beating rapidly and her stomach dropping as she reached out to knock on his door. Why was she so nervous?  Does he even like her? He answered and let her in, he was friendly and obliging as he suggested they watch a movie. Looking around his house, she noticed two things right off the bat: his house was immaculate, and it was bare, housing only the necessities. Strange for a young bachelor. She sat beside him on his couch awkwardly waiting for him to put his arm around her; yet, that moment never came. As the movie trailed on, the space between them seemed to grow, she had to make him see her.",kira-miyuki,2019-01-18 18:01:38,1,1080,42.97,87.07,11.51,37.22,19.29,15.19,92.22,61.3,19.72,13.24,2.41,1.11,0.74,7.87,1.11,6.48,7.59,14.17,9.17,7.22,7.22,1.85,17.59,4.44,2.22,2.41,1.57,1.76,5.93,3.24,2.59,0.37,1.2,0.19,15.37,0,0.65,4.17,4.17,11.57,3.06,2.13,1.67,2.78,1.2,1.57,2.22,0.93,0.37,0.65,1.39,0.46,0.19,0,0.56,6.39,2.22,1.67,1.76,1.2,0.46,4.81,9.81,1.67,16.3,2.31,6.76,7.41,1.2,1.02,0.65,0.19,0.19,0.19,0.37,0.09,0,0.09,0.19,0,14.81,4.44,6.11,0.19,0.19,0.74,0.09,0,1.3,1.76,0,0

ahj1zc,My emotionally abusive and manipulative ex boyfriend,"I wanted to post my story here to help others recognise the same red flags I ignored and help others not make the same mistake I did. I’m 17 now, I was 16 when I met him and he was the same age as me.

I have a prior history of being physically abused by my mother, which probably made me more vulnerable but abuse like this can happen to anyone.

This relationship is something I am so embarrassed I let happen to me and honestly I wish I had listened to those around me sooner. 

The relationship only ended a few months ago and it only went on for around 8 months before I left. While the abuse never became physical, I believe if I the relationship had lasted longer it eventually would have because he had physically abused his previous girlfriend after she moved in with him. (It’s a long story as to why she moved in when they are both teenagers and she moved in with his family. I honestly don’t even trust the account he gave me.)

I met this boy (we’ll call him W) through a mutual friend and we began talking. I will admit at the time I had been single for a while and desperately wanted to be in a relationship. I only really recognise this now and I believe W saw this and took full advantage of it. I was interested in him and he made it obvious he liked me and we started dating quite quickly. Things were great for the few weeks and I fell quite quickly. We talked often and spent most of our time playing video games together and sitting in discord calls together. He had slowly began to make me dependant on him through developing routines, I latch on to routines very quickly and become kind of hysterical when they’re broken, this is something W took full advantage of.

The first red flag appeared after he had messaged me saying he was going to work and asked me what I would be doing while he was gone. This seemed a normal enough question so I told him I’d most likely be watching Netflix. I ended up playing games with some old school friends of mine I hadn’t spoken to in a long time. After learning I had been playing games with these friends W became enraged and accused me of lying to him. I wanted to diffuse the situation so I apologised and said I would tell him if I was going to again. 

The second red flag was how possessive he was of me. He hated me talking to other men and would often accuse me of cheating on him with them even if I had only spoken to them once or twice. He would shut down if he ever saw me talking to them and he eventually later in the relationship made me stop talking to them all together.

The third red flag, also marked the beginning of the worsening of abuse, and was also the first time I attempted to end the relationship. I had wanted to buy event boxes with my own money for this video game I really enjoyed. W told me not to as he saw this as a waste of money. I know it wasn’t the best thing to spend money on, but it was my money and I could do whatever I wanted with it. After he learned that I bought them anyway he exploded at me, saying that I never listened, I was dumb and stupid and said no wonder he hated me sometimes. After telling some of my friends about this, they encouraged me to leave the relationship. I did try. After I told him I was leaving, and that it wasn’t acceptable for him to behave like this, and that I was leaving, he called me, crying, begging me not to leave, that he would change and if I ever left he’d kill himself.

So I stayed. I believed he would change.

Obviously he didn’t.

This cycle repeated at least two more times. After each attempt to leave the manipulation and control worsened. 

He would make me feel crazy for even thinking of leaving him, that it was my fault he would get angry with me. He’d take away routines to “punish me” (his words) for not listening. He expected me to always be happy, and talk in a cutesy way. He forced me to stop swearing, stop talking to ANYONE without asking him first and would pressure me to send nude photos of myself, demanding more and more each time. The control reached a point where I literally couldn’t do anything (Including going to the fucking bathroom) without asking him first. I was basically his pet.

While this was happening, I became withdrawn and isolated from my friends and family. They would tell me how bad it was tor me but I believed he’d change eventually I just needed to keep doing these things until he eventually trusted me enough to stop needing to control everything I did. 

I believed that I loved him. I thought he loved me.

I would find myself crying uncontrollably at night telling myself it wasn’t my fault. I felt lonely, and humiliated. I felt pathetic. 

I would reach out to his friends for help, some were apathetic, one normalised his behaviour and encouraged me to stay, only one ever genuinely tried to help me. I’ll call him R. 

I reached out to R initially to be friends with him. I’d reached a point in the abuse where I was basically broken. I was fearful of W but I accepted that everything was my fault and it was fine that this was happening because I deserved it.

I ended up becoming very close with R. We would talk for hours on end and eventually I trusted him enough to tell him about everything W had done to me. When R learned of everything W had done to me he snapped. He told me this wasn’t normal, that it was disgusting how W treated me and that I shouldn’t stay. 

The only reason I left was after realising that I didn’t deserve what was happening to me, and how W didn’t really love me.

I ended up leaving, with R’s support. The usual threats of suicide and self harm from W followed, but R and W’s friends kept an eye on him to assure me that everything was truly ok and I didn’t have to worry about him.

I don’t worry about him now. I feel nothing but disgust for W. I honestly never want anybody to go through what I did. And I do realise I didn’t help myself enough, and I don’t want anyone to ignore red flags like I did. I feel so much better letting all of this out.

ahjuqf,I am dealing with abuse from my boyfriend [29] and not sure what to do as I really love him. He is unemployed and blames his behaviour on that,"\- Gets furious very easily over nothing, screams and swears at me for no reason and out of the blue.

\- Continuously misinterprets what I say and then screams at me for what he thinks I said, when I actually said something completely different. It feels like I am talking to someone who twists everything around.

\- Has not had a job in over a year because he says he is too good for jobs that he thinks are ""below"" him so then he doesn't get a job.

\- Seems completely irrational about everything.

\- Said he is the most intelligent and talented person going for every job and he is overlooked because the system is rigged. Now he no longer applies and for every job he says he would be better than all the candidates.

\- Says he is not depressed (when I asked him).

\- Says he does not have social anxiety (when I asked him) and then yelled at me and became furious.

\- Only has one friend who he favours over me.

\- Sits home all day doing nothing and never leaves the house aside to get alcohol (we do not live together).

\- Drinks alcohol during the day and thinks it's funny. Sends me photos of him drinking and doing nothing.

\- Sleeps till midday every day.

\- When I asked him what he did that he just sits there all day staring at the wall doing nothing.

\- Says that he is very unlucky but yet won't do anything to change that. Refuses to apply for jobs. He keeps saying to me ""why did God do this to me?""

\- Obsessed with social media and is on it all day, posting etc. When I asked him why he does this he became furious and shut down all his accounts and then said that people were getting ""inspiration"" from him (!?) and that now they wouldn't because I made him shut them down (I didn't).

\- Has cheated with me before by sexting women online but denies it ( the woman contacted me with proof).

\- Said that he hates women and people of my race.

\- Goes into rages with no reason, just yelling incomprehensibly.

\- Accuses me of all types of things which are usually ironically things he does himself.

\- Has a phobia about getting a bad illness and dying.

\- My friend died and instead of consoling me he said ""too bad it wasn't me"".

\- Told me that he is someone special who has been disrespected and overlooked by society and when he dies people will appreciate his genius and gifts like Gandhi or Jesus. That he will be world famous.

\- Tells me I need to lose weight and work out even though I work out every day and am at lower end of healthy weight range.

\- Tells me I need to work harder even though I work hard every day and he sits at home doing nothing.

\- As he does not work, he borrows money for everyone he knows to support himself.

\- Puts down the things I achieve and says it's just luck or something just gave it to me rather than me working hard or being talented (am quite successful, more so than him, not that I would ever say that to him).

Despite these things I really love him and want to him him.

ahnm0q,What happens after,"I've never told anyone the following, I never will again I think. Just wondering if any of you lovely lot can help a brother out.

Quick backstory... Parents split when I was 4. Mum had a bit of a drink problem and father was absent 99% of the time. She soon met my step father who was physically and mentally abusive. 

He was raised through the troubles in Ireland and had seen a lot of friends die, hence why he had issues.

He often knocked us about, mum and me (only boy of 4 siblings) especially. I want to share some of my experiences only so it's relateable.

At age 10 and being left in the house for an evening with my sister's, my mum came flying through the door absolutely covered in blood. She had been at a party up the street and apparently flirted with someone in front of stepdad, so he beat her nearly to death. She kept screaming for us to lock the door because he was coming, he ended up kicking it in and carrying on. 2 weeks later we were all back to normal.

Once went to fly a kite he had gotten, he told me to throw it in the air as he ran (thinking back the kite thing was weird) I got confused and threw it at the wrong time. He took a run up and kicked my in the chest as punishment. I found out years later I have 2 deformed ribs which had broken at the time but never healed properly as I didn't dare tell anyone.

He once inspected my room (a weekly occurrence) and punched me so hard it knocked me out. I was probably 8 at the time and struggle to remember why he did it.

He once as punishment (again, I struggle to remember what for) stripped me naked and threw me into the street. We lived on a housing estate so a lot of people saw. 

There's another hundred examples like these that I can give to you all. None more pleasant unfortunately.

I learned at an early age to switch off emotionally. The only time I remember getting upset about it was when my friend insisted I went to his for tea and his mum asked me if anyone hurt me at home. When I wouldn't say she started getting upset that I wouldn't tell her and told her husband in front of me 'im not letting him go back there.' I finished eating in silence then snuck out. I cried for a while on the way home, I think I was ashamed.

Now I'm older (31) and have no real bad feelings about my childhood. I've seen the stepfather since (now separated from my mum) and have kept myself composed. 

The issue is I feel entirely dead inside. I don't trust easily and rarely open up. I also seem to go into a zoned out state when I get into a fight with my SO. She's understanding but its taken me nearly 10 years to tell her everything I can remember.

I see people around me who seem to be able to act normally and have an emotional range I can't hope to mimic. My 3 sisters who were mostly shielded from it all seem to have come out of it as normal human beings but I can't help but feel like some part of me just isn't alive... If that makes any sense. Like I'm on autopilot. 

I've occasionally felt depressed but never suicidal or anything.

What I want to know...

Is there something wrong with me?
How do I fix it?
Do I have to tell people what happened in order to fix it?

ahtcta,why can’t i get you out of my head [long],"i just have to rant right now. growing up, my sister abused my entire family. as a child, it was constantly hammered into my head that i will never amount to anything. that i’m worthless, ugly, and unwanted. all of my siblings had to endure this everyday. i remember that she threatened to stab my dad once, while me and my siblings locked ourselves in a room. she’s gotten so much better now, but it still slips through sometimes, and i still don’t quite forgive her.  now that the backstory is done, we can get to recent shit. i helped run the GSA at my highschool, but i left it about two weeks ago due to this and other shit. during a meeting, a new kid showed up. i’ll nickname them Empire, because that’s what i always called them. Empire was perfect. they had a beautiful smile, and always wore this letterman jacket. they just went through a rough breakup, so i guess they were just trying to find something to fill that void. and that filler was me. after Empire asked me to be their boyfriend, i was on top of the world. i proved everything my sister said to me wrong in just a day. Empire would skip class to see me during my lunch hour, and i’d skip study hall for their free hour. for two days, everything was perfect. we spent our time cuddling and talking. deep down, i knew i was a filler. but they said i wasn’t. then it all came crashing and burning down, when Empires ex came back (empire was still very much in love with them) and they requested to be left alone to talk. in the half hour i was gone, Empire took a scalpel to Empire’s wrist and punched a wall hard enough to bust their knuckles. they went to the hospital that night, together. Empire admitted that they lied to me when they said i wasn’t a rebound, and that they really did love their ex. i cried for a night, and then i was filled with rage. how fucking dare that piece of shit mess with ME. i wanted to punch their face until it could no longer be recognized as them. i didn’t, of course, and a week later that rage resided into a yearning for them to be back. i liked the way that they hurt me. i hated it, too. i want to do it all over again. i know that this comes from my sisters past, ever since she stopped the daily abuse i unconsciously looked for someone to make me feel like that again. and Empire is that person. why me? why did they have to make me miss them? why DO i miss them? do you guys have any methods on stopping this cycle?",iwishiwasascorpio,2019-01-19 18:39:18,1,483,26.33,50,94.19,3.71,12.07,11.39,92.96,60.25,24.84,17.39,10.56,0.83,0.41,0.83,4.76,7.45,4.35,12.84,8.28,6.21,6.21,1.45,17.6,4.76,1.86,1.66,0.83,1.86,6.42,2.07,4.35,0.21,2.48,1.45,13.46,1.45,0.41,1.45,0.62,11.18,1.86,1.86,1.24,1.66,2.9,1.86,2.48,0.83,0.62,1.04,2.9,1.86,0.21,0.21,0.21,8.28,3.31,0.62,2.48,1.66,1.04,9.73,7.87,0.83,18.22,1.66,7.04,9.94,1.04,0.21,0.41,0.41,0,0,1.24,0.83,0,0,0,0,16.56,7.25,5.38,0,0,0.83,0,0,0,2.28,0.41,0.41
ahtv78,Name calling,"My husband for the most part is kind to me. He says thank you and expresses gratitude when I cook a meal, run an errand etc. He does things to make me happy, takes me out, watches the shows I like, gets along with my family, etc. he's supportive of my projects and helps me out with house work. however whenever my husband and I have an argument or disagreement, his temper gets the better of him, small things will set him off and ""I get under his skin"" that's when the ugliness shows, in the past he has called me a ""bitch"", a fu\*\*ing retard"", told me to ""shut the fuck up"", etc. We've been married for a year, and I have expressed how unacceptable I think this behavior is, and that it's ok for him to get mad and argue, but it's not ok to call me names. and he has really improved in the last year, it's very rare to hear him say those things now, the difference between now and when we first got married is night and day, BUT it hasn't completely gone away; just now we got into a fight and he said ""don't be a fucking retard"".  
I don't know what to do to make it sink in his head that this is unacceptable, I just want it to stop.  


A little background: he's like this with his family, his siblings call each other names and fight all the time, they can't spend a couple of hours together without someone picking a fight and they have no problems being rude to their own parents, cussing and yelling at them, etc. out of the whole bunch, my husband is the best out of them, but they're all pretty messed up. It's extremely hard trying to change something that is so deeply ingrained in someone's personality. 

Is there hope for me?

ahw8pt,The day I almost lost myself to the monster I loved. PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING ABUSE.,"Okay so first of all I don’t want this to seem like a story in search for sympathy, but more of a way to finally accept it and move on, and hopefully help other girls, or boys, realise the red flags in a relationship that I so blindly overlooked. I’m sorry if this is a little long, but bare with me, it’s worth the read. 

Background information, I’m 18 years old, I met this boy, we’ll call him Trent. Saves me the pain of having to type his name. Trent and I met through a mutual friendship group of friends that I was very close with for many years, we started hanging out as a group to smoke and sesh with our friends. He was the loveliest boy with such kind eyes and the most adorable smile, I was infatuated. 

Trent had a past before I knew him, troubles with past girlfriends, and a bit known for a bad temper, but I ignored the warnings from multiple people and even an ex of his, assuming the classic lie “he’ll never hurt me though”. 

We started dating late March last year, 21st to be exact. He asked me out on a night when he had taken a lot of Xanax for “fun” with his friends and was expressing to me and his friends within 2 months of knowing him how he was completely head over heels for me, that made me fall deeper and deeper. 

Everything was so exciting and new and he gave me butterflies. Side note to this, I had been diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder and bipolar 2 disorder, which just adds to the fun of my life... 

All was good until about 4 months of being together, I was at home one night, planning to push through it and go out for some drinks with him and some friends, but changed my mind as I physically could not leave my bed. That night he disappeared, his phone off for hours and me worried sick. In the morning I wake up to a message saying his phone had gotten broken when he got pushed into the pool and he had to leave it to sit in rice overnight. He came over  to my house that day and took care of me while I was sick. 

2 months go by and I find out 3 days before my birthday that on that exact night he had cheated on me after he enticed his ex girlfriend to go over to his house, saying that he was going to take his own life because we had a fight and I wouldn’t speak to him anymore. They had sex that night and when I found out it broke me. My heart ached, and raced, pounded in my chest and I left his house in tears, with him chasing me up the street after me, I hid in a drive way and turned off my tracking location “Find My Friends” that he set up on my phone and caught the first bus that I saw after hiding and watching him pace around the streets, shirtless and shoeless while searching for me. 

An hour later I decided to answer his call (call number 23 or so) and tell him to leave me alone, it was then that he screamed and cried and begged, but I didn’t give in and so ended the call. 2 minutes later he called me saying he needed to go to the hospital as he shattered his hand while punching a hole in a glass mirror behind his door. 

After a few weeks of my heart longing for him and him begging for me, I felt like he must have really loved me to do all of this. The stupidest mistake I’ve ever made. 

His behaviour continued throughout our 6 month relationship, if I didn’t answer a phone call I’d receive 10 within 5 minutes and 10 messages of how I was “a dog” and a “bitch”. Even if I had just left my phone in my room for 20 minutes while I had dinner. He demanded to see me all the time and begged to be by my side every minute. I saw all of this As an expression of his love to me. 

Our relationship was spent majorly smoking weed, daily and I mean all day. If he wasn’t stoned, all hell would break loose until he could get high again. I spent hundreds of dollars buying marijuana to help him feel better when we’d argue in the car or he’d be in a bad mood. 

He had made threats to me and my friends in the past about “killing all of the dogs”, my friends did not see it the way I did and eventually we had falling outs and he assured me they weren’t my real friends, he was the only real person I had in my life who truly cared and loved me. And I believed that. 

My confidence diminished, my happiness was released in the smallest doses, I began to stop recognising the girl who I was and couldn’t remember how it felt to really feel genuine happiness. Only when he was in a good mood and wanted to be intimate and cuddly. That’s when I felt good.  

On our 6 months we had a lovely dinner in the city, at a super expensive restaurant, after our meal and a few drinks he told me to go wait around the corner for him to pay while I called a cab. I found out when he walked out tht he had not payed and we made a run for it. Later that night we went to visit our two best friends who were also a couple and were our “smoking squad” as we liked to call ourselves. We decided to go for a little drive (my sober friend was driving) around the corner and smoke a little before going home to bed. It was while we were chopping up that me and my girl Bella were whispering in the back, Trent couldn’t quite understand what we were talking about and demanded to know what we were saying, as a joke, Bella sarcastically replied that I was talking about another boy. This is when he ran around to her side of the car, as he did this I pulled the lock on her door and he punched a hole straight through her window, leaving shatters of glass flying all over him. The police came for a noise complaint and after coming up with an excuse I was left to walk my boyfriend home while he was sobbing and apologising, eventually we were escorted home in the police car. 

We broke up that weekend after encounters of him smashing his head into a wall, swiping a photo frame off the table and slicing his hand, punching a hole in my brothers care windscreen and grabbed my shirt while I was driving. I had officially been scared and saw for the first time that he might really be dangerous. I told him I could not be with him after the damage to my brothers car, my family would never look at him the same and would ban me from seeing him. The very next morning he made me pick him up at 8 am and he took the car to get the window fixed so I wouldn’t leave him. In short words I didn’t forgive him. 

A week later, a week of hundreds of missed calls, thousands of messages off every single social media possible, he began sending me photos of bottles of Xanax that he was buying telling me that he was going to eat them all and it was going to be all my fault. My heart dropped and I answered his call and begged him not to be so silly, I told him I would go and see him that afternoon to make sure he was okay but not to get back together. He seemed happy with that and hung up the phone. That day I was with a couple girlfriends at a pool party with some of my old friends that he didn’t particularly like. 

After being there for maybe an hour or so, I bet you can guess who just lets themselves in and walks straight inside, demanding to everyone that I leave right now. I refused I was petrified, his eyes, I knew that look, the way his green eyes turned almost black when he was in a rage. I continued to refuse and told him I would come outside and talk to him if he let me bring one of the boys outside to make sure I was okay. He did not take that one bit and decided to leave. Okay that was a relief for me. Less than 20 seconds later we hear smashing in the side street, the whole house ran out to investigate and watched as Trent ran back to his car and sped off after ripping off the windscreen wipers of another one of my best friends cars and shattering each window. 

At this point we were all so worried and angry and confused so we decided that we should drop the damaged car to my house so it was off the streets and somewhere safe, however my car was parked a few streets over, I got into the car and began driving when I was rammed into an intersection, my car was spinning and I quickly gained control only to realise that he was chasing behind me in his own car, we zoomed through the traffic, through red lights, intersections, squeezing through almost impossible car spaces in a movie-like pursuit. I almost hit 3 pedestrians and god knows how many cars. He chased me down the streets continuously ramming me, then slowing down and speeding up just to ram me again, glancing back in my rear few mirror I saw him laughing and taunting me, those eyes I will never forget. 

Immediately when I noticed him chasing me I called triple zero (Australia’s 911) and tried frantically explaining to the operator where I was and what was happening whilst being rammed and trying to dodge cars, people, sidewalks, poles and street signs, I thought I’d throw him off and turn into a car park that was right there but he was too quick and sped in front of my car locking me in while he blocked the exit with his car. The door opened and he stepped outside throwing himself at the windows and trying to rip open the doors, I screamed into the phone and begged for help but they just could not seem to find me, eventually I decided that the windows were going to give out soon and I needed to get away, so I drove up the gutter, ripping off half of the front bonnet of the car and sped all the way back up the street. I thought I got away when I saw he was struggling to get back into his car but that relief shattered when I saw his white car right behind me again, ramming and stopping, ramming and stopping while he laughed. 

I drove up through 3 suburbs and drove straight to my dads house, I honked the horn like a crazy person but his car was quick to catch up and I could not bare the thought of putting anyone in my family at risk of this maniac so I kept going, hoping that he wasn’t quick enough to swipe my car off the cliff edge that runs along my street. I continued driving, driving over the top of all the round abouts, but I didn’t care. My mother lives around the corner from my dads and I started to head there, but as I reached the street I remembered my 5 year old sister and my mum and couldn’t dare put them at risk. So I kept on driving. Around corners, swiping into cars and trying to find every main road possible begging for help to the operator and for them to just please find me.  I continued to fly down the street at 120km, I’m an 18 year old girl, ive never driven so fast or so chaotically. 


After about 10 minutes of what seemed like an hour, I reached yet another main road and repeated my location to the operator, all the while being rammed and tormented. He sped up in the lane next to me, in the opposite side of the road and swerved his car in front of mine in attempt to lock me in so he could try again to rip me from the car. My immediate reaction was the reverse, I put that car into R and put the accelerator flat to the floor. 

It only took seconds for him to get back into his car and begin driving at me, head on, the only thing I could do was drive forwards at him. This is the part where everything went in slow motion, I saw him coming at me, we were driving at eachother at about 40km/ph and my only options were to either crash into a parked car next to me, crash head on into Trent or crash into a telegraph pole on the other side of the road, the only thing running through my mind was “which way would be the quickest and least painful to die” so I chose the pole and I took a hard right turn as i missed the front of it by being saved by the gutter, saving my life by mere inches. This really made him mad and he turned the car back around and T boned the drivers side door, pinning me in. He got out and yet again punched and kicked and slammed all the windows. Now let me tell you, this boy is at least 100kg’s (idk how much that is in America) and 6 ft something. He was massive, I stood no chance. I began to hop from seat to seat trying to stay as far away from which ever window broke first as possible. 

This is when the sirens began to ring and I broke down and cried, as he ran back into his car and took off up the street. He jumped five fences before the managed to tackle him. He spent a weekend in a holding cell and was released on bail. My heart ached, my head spun, my mental illness had reached an all time low and without him, I was ready to die. The situation made me want to die. But for some strange reason I still loved him? It made me sick but I loved him, he was handed and restraining order but that didn’t stop him, the day of his release he began apologising, begging, crying saying he had no memory and he was so sorry he’d never do that again. 

This is the part where you’re all going to hate me, I wanted to take him back, I told him I still loved him and I still spoke to him daily. He told me he wouldn’t have done those things if I didn’t make him so angry and I apologised sincerely. But the jealousy and protectiveness continued. More threats “shouldn’t have called the cops and just let me kill you”, “I’m going to kill everyone close to you”, “I hope you die tomorrow, I’ll laugh”. 

The list goes on, and it took me 2 months to wake up and realise what the fuck I was doing, after he had bashed a boy that I had kissed, and started doing drive by’s at places that I’d hang out, just staring at me. 

So girls, boys, if you ever feel mistreated speak up, if you notice red flags, don’t ignore them. A leopard never changes his spots and if I had of stayed with him, I wouldn’t be here today to tell you the horror story that was my first relationship 

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope it wasn’t a trigger warning to anyone!! 

You’re all beautiful and deserve nothing but happiness, don’t settle for less because then you miss out on me.

ai1ifv,Point us in the right direction? (Mixed race kids isolated and abused by white 'parents'),"My partner [21, they/them] and I [24, he/him] grew up hundreds of miles apart in damn near identical circumstances -- I might talk about it more at some point, but for now, I'll just give a rundown of the basics, I guess. 

We both have severe complex PTSD. We were abused for over 20 years, each. We are both transgender. We finally got out of each of our situations last October, and are now safely living together. 

Neither of us are white, but the people who abused us were. In both cases, our abusers used our races as reason to abuse us further, while also demanding that neither of us ever bring up the fact that we aren't white -- it wasn't allowed to be mentioned except when they wanted to use it against us. Culturally, we haven't even experienced white culture -- we were locked in rooms out of sight and not allowed to interact with people. 

Now that we're free, we're grappling with the fact that we've been excusively abused for being mixed, and not knowing the cultures we should've grown up with. It leaves a massive hole in not only our identies and sense of self, but also in understanding where we fit in the world and how to interact with it, and parts of being able to take care of ourselves (mixed race hair and skin are different from white hair and skin, but we don't know how best to take care of these things becauss no one was there to teach us. Things like that). My partner is Mexican and white. I am Egyptian, Iranian, Armenian, Spanish, Greek, and white. 

Neither of us can go to therapy right now (believe me, we're trying to get into a position where we can). Does anyone know where we might be able to start learning about ourselves, or about other cases like ours? It's a lonely and frustrating position to be in.",stray0throwaway,2019-01-20 11:48:46,3,338,43.12,91.77,83.83,6.22,18.78,15.68,92.01,59.47,18.05,13.02,2.37,9.17,0,0.59,0.89,5.03,3.25,17.16,8.88,6.21,7.4,3.25,15.68,6.51,3.25,2.07,1.48,2.07,4.73,1.48,3.25,0,2.37,0.59,16.27,0.3,0.59,0,0.59,13.31,2.66,2.07,0.59,2.07,0.89,5.62,3.55,2.37,0,0.59,1.18,0.59,0.59,0,0,16.27,10.95,1.18,2.96,1.48,0.3,3.85,11.54,0.89,17.46,1.48,12.43,3.55,0.59,0,0.3,0.3,0,0,0.3,0.3,0,0,0,0,21.01,4.44,6.8,0,0,0.59,0,1.78,0,3.85,1.78,1.78
ai1s7w,When's the right time to tell someone about domestic abuse?,"My dad's been abusing my mom for years (mostly mentally, but sometimes physically). She regularly black outs/sleepwalks do to being mentally drained from all his screaming and yelling at her. I used to not want to butt in and defend her unless he hit her (because I didn't want to escalate the situation) but he's not stopping and he's not changing, so I'm gonna start fighting back even if he's just yelling. I want to tell someone outside of the family for help, but I don't know when I should do it. Just about 30mins ago he was yelling at her and he hit her with a metal spoon and her nose started bleeding. She's currently sleeping in my room. I want to tell my moms parents (they live downstairs). But I'm not sure if i should wait a few more days until he's cooled down, or if i should do it now when he's mad. Also, I don't have much evidence of his abuse over the years. And i'm thinking of getting my little brothers to tell their teaches that their dad's yells at and sometimes hits their mom.

ai24i5,Is This Abuse?,"I'm fifteen and I think my mother may be abusive. Here are some things she's done. (All of our arguments are both of us yelling, if that effects anything.): 

&amp;#x200B;

* One time, I wanted to wear an outfit that she disagreed with or it was some minor argument and I didn't have clothes on yet, I was still wrapped in a towel. We got into an argument, we were both yelling. She grabbed my arm and threw me to the floor, digging her nails into my arm and leaving a 1 and a half inch gash. It left a scar. 
* She was upset with me in fourth grade, so she pushed over a bookshelf full of collectables from our family trips that were my most prized possessions. 3 of my favorite ones broke, one was one of a kind. 
* She hits me with hairbrushes.
* She picks up whatever she can find and hits me with it. 
* Today, I wore an outfit she didn't like. It's in the teens outside and I am wearing black wool over the knee socks, boots, a turtleneck, a skirt that goes about 3 inches above my knees (in high school dress code by a lot), and a heavy trench coat. She told me I looked like a slut. Then she couldn't get me to take the outfit off, so she screamed at me not wearing my retainers. I've been sick and so I didn't wear them because I can't eat cough drops with the retainers on. I was going to wear them last night, but they weren't clean and it was midnight. I had asked if she could clean them, since I didn't know how. She yelled and said I was lazy and that I could do it myself. I decided to not wear them last night because I had a tooth ache and those dig into my gums pretty badly. I wore them the night before last. So we get into an argument and she's saying that I was the first one to yell. That I'm a disrespectful bitch, the usual. It ends with her throwing a heavy purse at my head and her winding all the way back and hitting me with a paddle brush to the arm. (It was supposed to be my face, but she missed.)
* She tells me I would be prettier if I lost 10-30 pounds.
* She tries to put me on crash diets.
* She guilted me about eating a whopper for one hour, so I got home and I ran four miles until I nearly passed out. 
* She tells me that it's my fault I get bullied. 
* She tells me that an 86 isn't a high enough grade for my first math test of the year. It's been three days of her yelling at me.
* She tells me I need to not have self confidence issues, then proceeds to insult me.
* She makes me feel so bad about myself that I think I am worthless and would like to kill myself.
* She tells me I need to go to a mental hospital because she yells at me and provokes me until I yell back.
* She's spit on me before.

I don't know if any of this counts as abuse or if I can even do anything about it in the state of Georgia, since she's careful to hit me, but not hard enough to leave bruises.

ai31mk,my dad has abuses me and i dont know know to deal with it anymore,"Alright so ever since i was a child i have been mentally and physically abused by my father and almost no one knows, i've told only a few people but no one believes them when they try and tell my mother in the case of me telling my nana aka my moms, mom or my friends telling their parents who most of which know my parents and refuse to believe them he stopped after he did something to me back when i was in 6th grade but only physically he continued with the mental abuse now I'm 16 and he' starting again because he's getting back surgery and he tends to act like a child and through temper tantrums. The thing is he doesn't have any mental problems and a few months ago when he started to act up again we where at his brothers house in colorado springs (we live in south conneticut) we drove, and before we left  he through a temper tantrum and had a fight with my mom i got caught in the middle of it and afterwards my mom tried apologising to me and i just broke down and told her most of the things he did to me, the main physical thing being the reason why he stopped being physical back when i was in 6th grade, he was coming home one night from work and my older sister by two-ish years was with my Nana cause she just had surgery well she forgot to do something and i knew he was going to be mad so i pushed my dresser in front of my door and then went to bed a few hours later when he got home he was pissed.

&amp;#x200B;

He went straight to my room and busted my door down and at the time i had a bunk bed for myself and always slept on the top bunk, he was either high or drunk possibly both he made his way over to me and started to shout at me near midnight (my mom didn't return home for around another hour or so and we still live in the same condominium) he then grabbed my hand and bite the skin off of my pinkie finger on my right hand now it wasn't the entire finger just the skin right below the nail.

ai437i,My mom might be abusive,"I think I'll just write this here since it's really hard to talk about this with anyone and abuse is a really big word and I don't wanna make myself look like a victim. Also this post might turn out to be super long but idk I just wanna vent.
I turned 18 recently and I've been suspecting it for a long time but after seeing how other parents treat their children with kindness and respect I came to accept that my parents (especially my mom) are probably abusive. 

Well my mom is Latina but we grew up in Germany, she would hit me and my brother very frequently with a belt. (She said she liked one belt in particular cause it had little stones and decorations on it and it hurt a lot). I always tried to speak up for myself even when I was young, I told her that I learned in school that hitting your children is illegal in Germany but she said that she doesn't care because she isn't German and in her culture it's okay to hit children. My dad would often hit is too.

She stopped hitting me when I turned about 11 cause I had a teacher that kind of jokingly mentioned how her mom would hit her with a wooden spoon when she was naughty so i'm like ""my mom does that too"" obviously my teachers got super worried after that and they were always asking if everything was okay at home and stuff. I think they ended up talking to my mom which is probably the reason she stopped with that. 

Well she continued to emotionally abuse us tho until today. At every minor mistake or inconvenience she calls us stupid and retarded and that we have no emotional intelligence (idk what exactly that is either lol). Anytime I try to defend myself she insults me personally, she never lets me talk. She even does that to my dad so basically my mom is a tyrant over the entire family lol. 

I know it's not nearly as bad as other cases of abuse I just needed to let this out because the way she treated me has had lasting effects on me. I have horrible generalized anxiety, I'm terrified of failure because I'm afraid to be yelled at, I basically think every minor inconvenience is my fault and my responsibility. 

There's so much more I could talk about  but I don't want this post to be too long. I'm just happy I'm going to be done with highschool in a few months and I'll be able to move out and go to Uni. 

Anyway I'm sorry this text is probably all over the place I just needed to get this off my chest",lilbaboon,2019-01-20 16:00:36,1,466,8.31,39,62.81,9.8,24.53,13.95,94.21,62.66,24.46,17.6,11.59,1.07,0.21,4.08,0.64,6.87,2.79,12.23,12.02,8.8,8.15,1.93,20.82,4.94,2.15,1.5,0.64,1.93,8.15,3.43,4.72,1.07,1.72,0.64,12.66,2.79,0,5.58,0.64,13.95,1.93,2.36,2.36,3,2.36,3,1.72,0.43,0.86,0.43,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,7.94,1.93,1.29,3.43,0.43,1.29,5.58,12.02,1.5,12.88,1.72,5.79,4.94,1.72,0.43,0.43,0,0,0,2.79,0.21,1.07,0.43,0.43,0.64,10.09,3.65,1.07,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,3.65,1.29,0

ai8va1,Abused friend is gone don't know how to help.,"I hope this is the right place to talk about this. A friend of mine has always had a rough life but all that seemed to change when he met his then girlfriend now ex wife at the time. I don't know all the details but apparently he went through every sort of abuse imaginable. He's in his early 20s and already tens of thousands in debt due to his ex and her mom doing things like using his car on the toll road without asking or telling him. They kept a lot of his personal belongings after throwing him to the streets where he was stuck sleeping outside, and moved away as soon as they kicked him out and have been making it so he no longer can see his infant son. She accused him of the very same abuse she inflicted on him and won full custody with no evidence but a lot of friends that rallied to her side and didn't actually see him do anything and she had no evidence for, just flocked to her side because of her abuse story she made up while my friend was out in the street unable to get home.  


&amp;#x200B;

I've seen pictures and videos and recordings of what his ex wife has done to him, it was anything from verbal to physical abuse. She's even attacked him with a knife. He would sometimes visit his family when she allowed him to see them and he would be covered in bruises or cuts but always passed it off as his job even when he didn't have a job. He's pretty sure she planned everything to end up this way because as far as he and I are aware he has only ever been drunk once in his life. This was when she was egging him on to drink a lot to celebrate a birthday. He doesn't remember the night very well but not too long after she became pregnant. She would constantly ask for forgiveness and promise to change after beating him or berating him harshly, or blame it on some mental illness she had that he didn't know about until then and there. Despite the way she treated him whenever we talked he would always talk about her and ask or talk about ideas how he could make her happy or improve her life in general, he wouldn't talk to me about the abuse though except a handful of times and would severely downplay it and blame himself because he ""wasn't caring enough"" or ""he wasn't taking care of her the way she needed.""  


&amp;#x200B;

In one day he lost his son, his family, a lot of his personal belongings that meant a lot to him and nearly every single friend of his except me and two others and she has branded him as a wife beater and drug abuser when I have known him for a lot longer than she has and he is very far from any of those things.  


&amp;#x200B;

The last time we spoke was in the summer of last year. He missed his sons very first birthday, and said he doesn't have anymore tears to shed and doesn't know why he bothers doing anything in life anymore. Nobody listened to him that could help and everyone dissuaded every piece of evidence he has, even though some are documented police visits and direct statements from his ex wife's own father and sister. He sent me a channel he made with a couple of the voice recordings and a small handful of photos here:   
[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXGgEKRbWsP-BfQe7ZxBrqA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXGgEKRbWsP-BfQe7ZxBrqA) (trigger warning, lots of anger and yelling)  


&amp;#x200B;

And hasn't been online or seen since. He is alive still it seems, but he hasn't spoken to me or his other two friends in almost a half a year and as far as we have been told or know, he refuses to make new friends in fear they will stab him in the back like they did before. The few friends he does have including myself don't really live close enough to check in on him or have the means to at this time, and we are just really worried this is the final time we will hear from him and that we will find out he isn't around anymore. His ex wife really messed him up and it doesn't help knowing she and her equally abusive mom have access to an unregistered gun from what her dad has said. She is also somewhat rich which definitely helped her win the case. If anyone knows any way to help my friend or can give me some pointers on where to start it would mean the world to me. Thank you for reading this far. I'm sure if he knew that there are people out there taking the time to read his story it would mean a lot to him.",afriendindeedinneed,2019-01-21 02:23:45,1,846,27.52,90.51,3.88,17.22,31.33,12.17,93.74,61.23,20.21,15.37,1.89,0.71,0.12,12.06,0.59,4.85,4.85,14.07,9.57,6.26,9.57,2.6,17.38,4.96,2.25,1.65,0.95,2.84,4.61,1.89,2.48,0.24,1.65,0.35,21.75,1.89,1.18,4.26,9.34,16.08,3.07,2.01,1.65,4.85,1.77,4.96,2.25,0.95,0.95,0.35,1.65,0.12,1.18,0.12,0.35,6.38,3.78,0.95,1.77,0.71,0.12,6.15,8.98,0.83,14.18,1.18,6.97,6.15,0.47,1.54,0.35,0.24,0,0.12,0.95,0,0.24,0,0.12,0,11.94,3.66,1.54,0.12,0.95,0,0,0.24,0.47,2.6,0.47,1.89

aid1zd,My [22f] friend [16f] from another country has an abusive mother and I don't know how to help,"She lives in Germany and I live in another European country.

Her mother has abused her emotionally and physically to the point that she thought it's normal and that she deserves it.

It's been a bit over a year since she first confessed to me that her mother hits her when she's done something wrong. I've managed to convince her that it's definitely not normal but she refuses to get help.

On new years her parents got into a huge fight and the mother ended up calling police (I'm unsure of the reason). The next day they had a family councellor visit them and the parents claimed everything was fine. They were spoken to as a family (father, mother, my friend and her brother) so of course the kids didn't dare to go against their parents, and the councellor left without actually achieving anything.

My friend is scared to the point that she would rather kill herself than face her mother if she's done something bad.

I have told her many times that she needs to seek help so she could be safe from her mother. She has already suffered so much emotional trauma and it will just keep getting worse and it will most likely affect her life negatively in long term. But she has decided that she would rather just deal with it until she's old enough to move out, which I'm not a huge fan of. She trusts everyone who's nice to her and that combined with the freedom of living alone could lead her into some really bad places.

Her mother wants to divorce her father but he wants to stay together for the kids. My friend doesn't want her parents to separate because she doesn't want her family to break. That's also why she doesn't want to seek help as she doesnt want to be taken away.

If I lived in the same country I would have reported her situation to authorities even though she would probably hate me for that. I haven't looked into if it's possible to do it from another country.

I want to trust in her word that she can handle this situation and doesn't need help but I'm doubtful.

TL;DR: Friend's mother is abusive and she refuses to get help. I want to help but I dont know how.",worri3dpal,2019-01-21 10:31:00,1,408,18.35,84.84,1.19,3.04,19.43,14.71,95.1,60.29,23.53,15.93,4.66,0,0,10.29,0.98,7.6,4.41,12.99,11.52,4.66,8.09,3.19,20.83,4.17,1.47,1.47,0.25,1.96,5.88,1.72,4.17,0.74,1.47,0.49,23.28,4.9,0.98,12.25,0.98,15.69,1.72,1.96,5.15,3.19,0.74,5.15,0.49,0.25,0.25,0,1.96,0.25,1.72,0,0,11.76,4.9,0.98,4.41,1.72,2.21,4.66,13.97,0.98,11.27,1.23,6.62,3.43,1.96,0.74,0.74,0,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.48,4.9,0.98,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,0,5.15,0.98,0.98
aifrpk,Was it coercion? Abuse? Is it okay to feel this way?,"I'm so sorry if this doesn't fit here. I really don't know where to turn to with this. I'm so confused and hurting. Made a throwaway for this. I 

I don't want to tell the whole story. Or, I want to, I really want to, but there is just so much and two months after the breakup I am still sorting out my thoughts and memories. I just wanted to ask whether or not some of these things can be classified as coercion or abuse, and whether or not I am justified in feeling the way I do- violated, scared, angry. I cry several times a day, can't control it. No matter what I do, my mind goes back to the things that happened. I can't stop thinking about them, nothing helps. I get shaky and feel like I can't breathe right. It's so, so hard and I have nowhere to go, I don't even know if it's okay to feel this way or if I am just making things up and making a big deal out of nothing. 
So here are a few things that happened. 

- When I didn't want to have sex, he sometimes cried. I then felt so guilty that I cried too, and then we had sex. 
- If I wore clothes he liked and later said no to sex, he would tell me he felt 'tricked'. We agreed that I wouldn't wear 'sexy' clothes unless I wanted to have sex later. If I didn't want to have sex, I was told to signal it to him by wearing joggers or something similar.
- He told me to decide in the morning whether or not I wanted to have sex that day, so he wouldn't get his hopes up.
- When I slept over, he told me to sleep naked or in lingerie, even in the winter. He didn't force me, but he was so sad when I wore something warmer and I felt weak/guilty when I did, so I agreed.
- Since he was so upset when I didn't want to have sex, we agreed that he could fuck me while I slept (so at least I didn't have to participate). One time I woke up to him touching me, trying to penetrate me, and eventually ejaculating on my thigh. I was so drowsy that I fell asleep again. The next morning I asked him about it and he denied it happened at all. I got very upset and he finally admitted that it did happen. 
- Sometimes when we didn't have sex and I just wanted to sleep, he'd pace around the apartment as if he was super stressed, flicking lights on and off, sitting down at the desk and standing up again, slamming the bathroom door etc. (to compare, when we did have sex, he was very relaxed and fell asleep with me immediately). I eventually felt so guilty for not letting him 'relax' that I let him fuck me even if I didn't feel like it. 
- One time I woke up and kept my eyes closed. He was standing at the foot of the bed, gripping my legs hard as if he wanted to spread them. He stood there for at least twenty minutes before he let go. The next morning I asked him about it and he also denied it. 

I loved him so, so much and just wanted to make him happy, to be enough. I wanted to be a cool girlfriend who's always up for it. Throughout our relationship, guilt was my most frequently felt emotion. I did many things out of guilt like you can read above. So is this all on me, since he didn't force me to do anything? Or was some of it coercion? I don't know who to ask.

I have been diagnosed with vaginismus since then- sex is physically impossible. I avoid taking baths and showers as much as I can because I can't stand being naked. I am hyperaware of my sexuality and avoid wearing the clothes he liked. I get feelings of extreme guilt when I wear the 'no sex today' clothes like joggers or long-sleeves, even though he is long gone. I don't know what to do. He never forced me to do anything. I know I'm overreacting and that it wasn't so bad. But I'm overwhelmed by what I'm feeling.

Again, I'm sorry if this is super messy to read. I really struggle with putting things into words. And I'm sorry if it doesn't fit here at all.

aih0f1,My[26F] boyfriend[28M] has become so suffocating in regards to me having interpersonal relationships with friends and family. I don’t know what to do anymore.,"I also posted this in r/relationship_advice so I apologize to anyone for the double read.

I want to precede this by saying I’m no angel in the situation. I want to paint an accurate picture of the problem, so that has to include my faults as well which led him to this point. 

I am a woman who has struggled with alcoholism for a while as I work and have worked as a bartender for many years. I would like to consider myself a generally nice jovial person on a day to day basis, but as I am a long term sufferer of past domestic abuse for an extended amount time, I found I slumped very deep into long standing depression and anxiety issues. I don’t necessarily drink all the time, but more so when I feel very stressed or anxious to (seemingly) calm my nerves. This certainly doesn’t happen every time, or even a quarter of the time, but I have blacked out from drinking and put myself in questionable situations before. As an example, I have called my boyfriend to meet me downtown and then waited on outdoor steps and kind of fell asleep, alone. I know that of course this is not only scary for me and him, but also frustrating for him to have a girlfriend who can put herself in this unsafe situation. We shared location on our phones so he was able to find me okay, but in general I know from his perspective (and my own) it’s not acceptable. 

There was a time I was drunk, unable to get into a club with my friends because my ID expired, and as I walked out on the street I called my best friend to pick me up from downtown, but I blacked out shortly after. She said when she arrived there was a guy on top of me sexually assaulting me. My boyfriend turned around and blamed me, which I understand I put myself in that position by drinking and passing out, but I cannot understand someone having no compassion toward me. When I hear this, I feel scared, I feel anxious and disgusted, but I feel even more hurt to have my boyfriend say it’s my fault to be sexually assaulted. 


I admit my flaws, I am trying to change myself so much for the better, but it is not an overnight process to 1. Lose an addiction but also 2. Get over past abuse and psychological issues over night. But I am trying to drink less. 

I know my psychological issues are not for anyone else to suffer through or deal with, but as someone who loves me and wants to be with me, I do expect a level of compassion.

I am the type of person who has numerous childhood friends from when I was 4-6 years old — lifelong friends, best friends. I will always have them in my life. But my boyfriend has come to a point where he isn’t comfortable with me going out with anyone, talking to anyone, or basically doing anything without him. It’s become so suffocating and depressing for me. I’ve become afraid of mentioning anything to him for fear of him throwing things, breaking things, and screaming in my face. He will demean and berate me for even mentioning I went to my BEST friends birthday party for a few hours. When one of my best guy friends passed away, he said it’s not acceptable to cry for another guy for three days. On family events, he is upset if I stay too long at my parents house. 

These are just a few examples, but I don’t know what to do anymore. This in itself has become abuse, which as a survivor, I just need to be away from. I recognize I perhaps brought this on myself, but I can’t go on another day not being able to see my loved ones. If anything, an abuse victim NEEDS a strong support system. I don’t understand why my boyfriend tries to take that away from me, and I don’t know what to do anymore.

Beyond this, in our alone time, he is my best friend. We have amazing times together and I don’t consider him a bad abusive person. When I submit to his wishes and cut off my social life, he is wonderful to me. But I shouldn’t have to do that. I almost feel that I’ve brought this out of him, but it feels irreversible. I have tried in every way to healthily express my concerns and issues but he doesn’t care or listen. He will not change. I don’t feel, as someone who was already struggling, that I need this type of behaviour being done to me... but I also understand I as a person haven’t made it easy to love me. 

What actions can I take from here to make this situation better?",kaleigha,2019-01-21 16:26:35,4,849,28.89,20.81,93.88,10.78,19.3,16.14,94.7,62.07,22.5,15.67,12.49,0.47,0,2.59,0.12,6.83,3.89,15.78,9.31,4.71,9.07,2.83,18.26,5.3,2.71,2.36,0.94,1.65,8.01,3.42,4.59,1.3,1.06,1.06,11.31,0.35,2.24,0.47,3.3,13.31,3.65,1.06,1.53,2.83,0.82,4.59,2.12,0.24,0.94,0.94,2.24,0.35,0.59,0.24,0.82,8.95,4.24,2.24,2.12,1.3,0.71,3.65,13.07,0.94,13.66,2.59,6.71,4.48,0.71,1.3,0.47,0,0.12,0,0.35,0,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,13.9,5.3,4.83,0,0,0.12,0,0.12,0,2.36,0.47,0.71

i will be the first one to say that i fucked up. i really truly did. he stuck by me because he had known me for awhile before getting into a relationship with me and knew i’d be better and my breakdowns weren’t really me. i would have breakdowns normally triggered by me becoming upset or frustrated and it’d just spiral down into a two hour session of me projecting my own insecurities onto him and verbally abusing him. the entire time i was seeking help (counselling, stopping birth control, coping mechanisms). nothing was really working long term and the breakdowns were horrible. i would tell him that i hate him and that he didn’t care about me or love me and that i didn’t love him and i didn’t care that i was hurting his feelings. just about every horrible thing you can say to a s/o i told him at least once. i knew i had a problem and always apologized for what i said and never made an excuse for my behavior. but now after starting the medicine two months ago and being forced to take a break from him i truly see how fucked up it all was. i look back on those texts and feel horrible. i am disgusted with what i said to him. and i know that all of his family and my parents are disappointed in me and i just don’t know how to feel. i started taking a mood stabilizer the day after we were separated and i really feel that i am better. i know those breakdowns will rarely if ever happen again but i still feel so sick. i really truly love him and i hate that he went through that for me. i know i did wrong and he knows i regret everything and he accepts my numerous apologies and is thankful everything’s over and he has the real me back but it’s just the weight of knowing everyone else hates me for it i just can’t handle it. i am disgusted with myself and i just don’t know what to think. any advice or similar experiences would be helpful.",immrtalz,2019-01-21 18:59:33,2,400,9.57,15.86,90.87,2.89,19.05,15.25,95.75,63.75,25.5,19.25,14.25,0.25,0.25,4.5,0,6.25,3.75,10.5,9.5,7.5,8.75,2.25,20.75,4.5,2.5,1.25,1.5,1.5,9.25,3.25,5.75,1.25,2.25,1,11.75,0.5,0.5,0,5,17.75,4.75,1.75,2.25,1.5,3.75,5,4,0.5,1,2,2.5,0.25,0.75,0.5,0.25,7.5,2.75,1,2.5,1.25,0.75,7,10,0.5,11.75,0.75,4,7.25,0.75,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,1.5,0.75,0.75,0,0,0,9.75,5,0.75,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,2.75,0.5,0.5

It's my first time talking about this, please be gentle.

&amp;#x200B;

It took me very long to make this post, to even think about write about makes me uneasy.

I was raped a few years ago, and didn't told anyone, not even my family. I didn't got the medical suport (for STDs ans stuff) or emotional support as the years passed. I tried to bottle up all the memories and feelings.

Things got really worst when I was diagnosed with BPD \*Borderline Personality Disorder\* \[few months ago\], I had to go to all that doctors, triyng new meds, it was overwhelming.

I can't be touched, have nightmares, anxiety, depression... all that. I'm trying my best to build up the strength to overcome all this, to finally talk about it, but the pain, disgust, shame and fearfulness are unbereable.

ainbgh,im not sure what to do,"So the situation is like this. Im 22 yr old woman, working remotely, not making much money. Im living with my mom and my boyfriend in my mom's flat. I started dating my boyfriend with I was 18. I was just entering college. And he’s older than me, by 7 years. So for the first couple of years he lived in a flat with his roommate. The rent was cheap, and he wasn’t making much money, so we couldn’t move in together, bc I was in college, not making any money and living with my mom. At the time he occasionally borrowed money from me. Not much, but he was always in debt by 100 bucks or so. So then his landlord told him to move out. He had nowhere to go, but his mum, and she lived away from the city, so I told him to move in with me and my mom. I thought it would be temporary and when I graduate we will eventually find some place for us. Then everything was okay. I was studying and he was working. Then I flew away to participate in competition (my college paid all expenses). I was away for like a week and when I came back he said that he quit his job bc he couldn’t stand his boss anymore. It was in February. In May he found a job and for a year and a half everything was okay. I graduated and started working. But in last October he was fired bc he haven’t been complying with some inner regulations of the organisation he was working in. I was devastated. I thought that when I’ll start making enough money we’ll move from my mom’s flat. but with him not working it would be impossible. So he told me that everything will be okay and he’ll find a job. for a couple of months I was chill. But now it’s the end of January and I started freaking out again. Im constantly searching for job openings for him, writing covering letters for him, basically begging him to find at least something. And he’s like nah I don’t like this I don’t like that, I’ll wait for something to come by. And im asking him what you what to do? And he doesn’t fucking know what HE wants to DO. Its fucking devastating. im constantly telling him to find a job and sometimes he says something like “you choking me! Leave me alone, im trying” and gets all sensitive and starting to gaslight me. I don’t know what to do. He threatens that he’ll sell his computer (which I believe is a manipulation, because he knows I don’t want him to start selling his possessions). Or that he will go and life with his mum in the country. I feel trapped. I don’t want to lose him because other than that we are very close and he’s understanding, caring and all that. But l can’t continue to lend him money every week so he could fucking get himself a sick pack and get drunk because he needs to, and I quote, “unwind”. when I ask him to clean the apartment or cook something, he refuses. all he does is buying groceries (with my money) and cleans up after our cat. moreover, i need money for medication and medical treatment, which I had to borrow from my mum (I'm not dying but still). I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know if it is abuse or not. I just wanted to tell my story.

air66k,I can’t seem to leave him,"**tl;dr;** Unsure how to leave a relationship that I know I’m done with; possibly abusive 

I (23F) met my current boyfriend (31M)at work while I was in a different relationship, and immediately slept with him after I ended it with my ex. I hadn’t been single in a couple years, as I had a habit of starting a relationship right after another ended. So after a long string of boyfriends, I ended up with (we’ll call him) Brian. 

I obviously wasn’t ready to commit. I told Brian I wanted something casual after just leaving my previous relationship, but he ended up confessing that he loved me about a month in (We’d known each other for a year and half at this point). I was confused often, since part of me was strongly attracted to him but still getting over my ex.  

I made a horrible mistake in my confusion and ended up kissing another coworker when I was drunk one night. I had never cheated before, and I felt horrible. He was mortified, but wanted to stay for some reason. I told him I’d do whatever I needed to in order to make things work.

For the first month, he would come home drunk and yell at me. I thought I deserved it. He would curse at me, mock me. I wanted to make things better, but was unsure of why he stayed given the way he yelled at me. I figured that this behavior was justified.

After a couple months it calmed down. I was honest and communicative with him. We were getting along better, and I had asked if he’d feel comfortable coming to thanksgiving to meet my family, and he said he was.

The night before the holiday, he was drunk again. One of his friends made him think I was out partying with his roommate because “this girl only drank one kind of beer that you also drink”, and he said that he wouldn’t come home that night AND not come to thanksgiving. He made me go through my phone to see what I was doing on September 21st, and I was freaking out. I even had my best friend help me search (it’s turns out, I was with her the whole day). Then he called me and started yelling at me again, and my best friend was there to hear the whole conversation. She was furious and was convinced that he was being emotionally abusive, pushing that I end it.

I’ve tried ending it, but I find myself coming back to him. He won’t stop drinking for me, because he doesn’t think that alcohol is the problem. The other night, he came home so drunk that he couldn’t walk straight. He kept grabbing me and blocking the door so I couldn’t leave. 

Is this abuse? And why can’t I find the strength to leave him? I feel so alone now, and I can’t even be by myself now without getting depressed.",teeramarie,2019-01-22 12:37:51,2,503,21.06,38.26,84.29,8.92,15.72,14.51,97.02,61.03,25.45,19.68,12.13,0.6,0.2,6.76,0,5.77,3.98,12.92,9.34,4.77,6.96,2.58,22.66,3.98,2.58,1.19,1.19,1.99,6.76,2.58,3.98,0.99,1.79,0.4,14.12,0.2,1.19,0.6,6.76,12.92,3.18,2.58,2.39,2.19,0.6,2.98,2.58,0.4,1.39,0.8,2.39,0.2,0.4,0,1.79,9.34,4.37,1.79,2.39,1.39,0.8,11.73,8.55,0.99,17.89,3.58,5.96,8.75,0.6,2.39,1.19,0,0.2,0,0.6,0.2,0,0,0,0,17.69,5.77,4.37,0,0.6,0.4,0,0,0.4,3.38,1.99,0.8
airy3p,What do I do?,"Long story short, for the last 8 years or so, I've been on the firing end of my dad's temper for several reasons. Like a typical family with a narc parent, there is the golden child (My youngest sister) and there is the scapegoat. Me.

Up until last September, I hadn't talked to my dad for the best part of 18 months and unfortunately, this is just a repeat of the cycle. We get annoyed at each other for a petty thing that her blew up, I stop talking to him for a long while until one or more of my other family members (Usually his parents) pester me to talk to him again because ""he's such a great person"" and ""he's do anything for me"". Basically they'll talk about him like he's the second coming because even at 46, he's still their precious angel child who could do no wrong. I mean, just ask my sister, she doesn't cause him any problems. They'll pester me every chance they get to welcome him back into my life with open arms and it works every time.

I love my grandparent, I know I can trust them with my life, but not matter how hard I try, I can never convince them that what my dad does and says to me behind close doors hurts and terrifies me. My perfect nightmare is being locked in a space alone with him.

A couple of years ago just before Christmas, my Nana invited me out to go Christmas shopping with her and I thought ""We haven't spent a lot of time together lately. Of course I'll go"" And for the most part, he had a pretty good time. Until it got to the drive home. She asked me:

""Do you know what I really want for Christmas?""

""What?""

""For you to get along with your dad."" I try to tell her once again that my dad and I are best being as far apart as possible because we just don't mix. There is no possible communication between us and once again, she's not picking any of it up. She starts going off on the same speech, showing him in compliments about how kind her is etc etc, and then asks me ""What has he ever done to you?""

I give her this list of all the names he's called me, the trauma I was put through all through my teen years, how my youngest sister gets all the special treatment because she doesn't argue with him and I very quickly explode with tears at all the horrible memories I've had with him and for the first time ever, she drops it and we go home. She then has a talk with my mum about how upset I got and she never brought my dad up in front of me since.

My grandad wasn't as easily swayed.

She's fine now, but recently, my nana was diagnosed with breast cancer and while she was getting treatment, my grandad came over to visit me. He talks about nana and then about dad and the typical threat of praise. The he hands me £100 in cash, basically bribing me to talk to dad again because it would mean so much to Nana. I refuse the money, but he insists, I'm guilt tripped and what do you know? Dad is back in my contacts again.

He hasn't changed, wouldn't you expect? And regularly texts me about how much he misses me and how much he want me in his life. That's rich considering her hasn't invited me on any family holidays abroad, but took my sisters and no birthday or Christmas presents, but that's his logic.

I just feel so emotionally torn between keeping my grandparents happy in exchange for my happiness and keeping myself happiness in exchange for theirs. I don't know how long I have left with either of them and the idea of hurting them tears me up inside. But whichever I choose, I'm unhappy either way.

aisp09,My dad [55M] tried to murder me twice when I [29M] was a minor,"I am seeking advice on how to deal with my past with my dad. This is going to be a long post where I will attempt to detail a lot of the major events in my life that have created a rift between me and my dad (and somewhat to my mom). There will be a TLDR at the bottom.

To start, my parents got hitched when they were in their early 20s. Both have no college experience/education. I have never seen proof that either even graduated high school. They met in their home country. We immigrated to the US when I was 12.

My dad has had an abusive upbringing. From the bits and pieces that I've gathered from other family members, what I know is that: his father was terrible -- very physically and mentally abusive and a habitual cheater. His mother, according to my mom's family, was an angel. Extremely loving and patient. Withstood terrible abuse from her husband. On her deathbed (she died much earlier than her husband), all she asked was for her husband to hold her hand, and the man said no. This person (my grandfather) is a terrible subject amongst whoever I talk to in my family. Apparently he passed away while living with another woman more than a decade after my grandma's death.

My dad took on similar traits.

As soon as my parents got married and my mom got pregnant with me, he was physically abusive and habitually cheating. On my first birthday, when my mom confronted him about another woman, he beat her up in front of baby me and her parents (who tell me they were old at the time and frightened by this).

Out of everything I can remember from my childhood, there is a lot of shouting, fighting, and throwing and smashing things from my dad. Him throwing food, smashing TV's, throwing a metal hole puncher at my mom and toddler me are specific memories that I still can recollect. I remember probably as a 5 year old I wet my bed and my dad held me by the window and threatened to throw me out of it (this was several floors up of an apartment building), with my mom shouting and crying helplessly in the background.

Throughout this post I will continue to talk about my dad, but this is why I have some resentment towards my mom too. The fact that she didn't proactively choose to leave my dad was essentially choosing to put herself and me in danger. If she was smart and calculative enough to know what was good for her, I think the best option for her at the time would have been to leave my dad. I understand that as a single mother life might have been very hard, and I may have complained about why I didn't have a dad, but the fact that my dad tried to stab and kill me twice proves to me that the safer choice would have been for her to leave. One of the main reasons I believe she didn't leave is because she is very hardheaded and as the youngest of 4 siblings, she may have married my dad out of her own family issues (which are relatively minor). Her parents strongly advised against her marrying my dad, and she did, so when the marriage didn't work out very well, she chose to stick with her choice rather than admit that her parents were right.

My little brother was born when I was six. During the late stages of her pregnancy, my parents had a fight after my dad came home drunk one night. He beat up my pregnant mom, and when she said to stop because she was pregnant, she says that he said ""I'm gonna kill you both"", and stepped and kicked her pregnant belly. Thankfully my brother was born ok. My mom told me this story when I was about 15. Ever since I heard this, I've developed such a stronger love for my little brother. To this day, my brother is 23 years old, and does not know about this story. I don't know if I should share this story with him, and if so, how. He has a relatively good relationship with my dad. More on this later.

My parents moved around a LOT, mostly because they didn't have an education and career paths. I was not born in my parent's home country. My parents immigrated at least five times to different countries. Before we came to the US at my age 12, I had lived in 4 different countries with 3 different languages. I came to the US at 7th grade (middle school). Every single year of my elementary school was spent in a different school. Even after we came to the US, we moved around very often, and I spent every single school year in a different school. I've spent every year of my k-12 education at a different school. This was mentally very hard on me.

After we came to the US, my mom left us. Actually, let me preface that. For most of my life before coming to the US, my father was almost an absentee father. He would claim he'd need to be away for work, and was almost always never home, many times for months. He'd hop countries looking for work (very uneducated decisions). His temper probably burned many bridges in his social/work life, so he was always looking to move somewhere else. In some of the countries where we lived, my mother barely spoke the language there. I can't imagine how scary that must be for a single mother with two boys. During most of the years, I believe my father came back with support money. My mom at one point had a small clothing store where she was generating income. But having an absentee husband while stuck in a foreign country was taking a toll on her. During the last stages of their first marriage, she was telling my dad that he needs to do his share and raise the kids. So when we came to US, my mom left my dad, and left her two boys with him. She went back to her home country.

During the first year with living with my dad, life was relatively ok. We were dirt poor and illegal immigrants in the US, but life was ok. The US culture was a fun and exciting one to learn. Also during this time my father basically brainwashed us into thinking that our mother was a terrible mother who left us. During the second year, my dad brought over a woman with a daughter, and started cohabiting. Me and my brother weren't very happy, but my father said one of the reasons this is necessary is because he needs to marry an American so that we can live legally in the US. This woman was not very nice. She was the typical bad Cinderella stepmother. She drove her daughter to school which was a block away, but forced me to ride my bike to my high school 1.6 miles away where I was a new freshman. The route had a steep incline of 150 ft, as we lived on a hill. I grew giant stubby thighs and calfs, and my height didn't grow much after this. When my father would come home, she would tell him that I was bad and he would beat me up. Specific memories: he threw his shot of whiskey at my face. He spit on my face during dinner. He threw a dinner table chair at me. He put me in the back of his minivan that had no seats, and drove recklessly so that I'd be tossed around in the van. I was 13. The woman would not hit me, perhaps out of fear of retaliation, but would hit me 7 year old brother all the time. Some other memories that I have: he put our dog in the dryer and turned it on for a few seconds ""just for fun"". He took one of our dogs into the woods and left it there because we were moving and ""couldn't take care of it anymore"". We lived with the woman and her daughter for about 2 years, and their relationship never worked out so they never got married. Although I'm not sure, there is some suspicion that my dad cheated on her too, and so she left.

No longer living with that woman was a slight relief, but things didn't get much better. I was getting older with no legal status. My dad called my mom to make amends, persuaded her to come out to the US, start anew and live with us. Me and my brother were happy, but we would have to continue to live as an illegal immigrant family. My mom had not been back more than two months when my dad started beating on her again. One day I came back from school and my mom had a chipped tooth. She said she fell down some stairs. This reunited stage did not last long. My mom got a traffic ticket, and out of fear, convinced my dad that she was going back to her home country. They both assured me they were staying together, just in separate countries. My mom was taking my little brother to her home country. At this point, we had both become quite Americanized, and I emphatically told my mom to leave my little brother here with me. I didn't want to lose my brother, we had developed such a strong bond and connection. In retrospect, my mom made the safer choice.

After my mom left, I had to live with my dad alone. I was 15, pimply faced and shy. Up until this point, I never had the mental strength and capacity to talk back to my parents, but I started coming into my own and standing up to illogical arguments. And so it happened. I stood up to him during an argument and told him he was contradicting himself, and he was wrong. He flipped, smashed several things around me, including my most valuable items at the time, my acoustic guitar. He also smashed my tennis racket and my gamecube. And then he took out the big kitchen knife, held me against the wall, and put the pointed blade about 2 inches from my stomach. At this point there was no point in arguing to win the argument, I had to say whatever I had to say to SAVE MY LIFE. I was 15 years old. I told him he was right and I was sorry. The situation diffused and I lived. This was the first time he tried to murder me.

Not long after my mom left, my dad brought over and introduced another woman. He said they were going to get married. The woman had a little boy much younger than my little brother. I was very apprehensive and said no to the new relationship. I reminded him that I was told that him and my mom were still together. He smashed some more of my things and made me accept.

The new woman (stepmother #2) turned out to be different from Stepmother #1. Although not perfect, she was much nicer. She was college educated, and had a professional career. Not to my surprise however, the relationship was not harmonious. My dad's temper always got in the way, he was physically abusive with her, and he spent jail time for domestic violence (one of the only instances in this post where justice was served). The woman stayed with him but kept refusing to actually marry him (thus keeping my dad and I without papers). By my senior year, I had developed a good social standing with my new peers at my new school. I had good friends, and was enjoying life for the first time in what seemed like an eternity. Then one day, my dad came home, and we got in a very small argument for some minor thing. I wasn't even that worried, until he busted out the kitchen knife again, pinned 17 year old me against the wall, and pointed the knife 2 inches from my stomach. Again, I had to say whatever I had to say to save my life. Over some minor trivial thing. It was not the argument, but my dad's temper, and his lack of life principles, that almost ended my life again. I could not believe my life. Some time later, I penned up a letter detailing some of the horrific things he did to me and my family members that I was going to send to the stepmother. It was a tell-all type of letter heavily advising her to leave my dad. However, at the frail age of 17, I decided to keep the letter and not send it. Perhaps I was afraid of unpredictable consequences. My dad, who habitually went through my stuff without permission, one day found the letter and ripped it up into pieces. I lost whatever remaining respect I had for him.

Since they didn't get married, I was still out of legal status in the US, so before I turned 18, my dad and my mom decided to send me to my mom's home country, where she was living with my brother. I hated it. I hated not having a single place or country to call home in my 18 years of life. I lived with my mom and brother in her home country (where I wasn't even born) for the next few years. Fortunately, and perhaps because of the absence of my dad, I thrived. I went to university there, built an exciting social life, and had great experiences. Eventually my dad and the stepmom got married, after I turned 21. My younger brother got his green card almost immediately and came to the US as a sophomore in high school. Since I was over 21, I wouldnt be able to get my green card until about 6 years later, at age 27. At around age 23, I came back to the US as an international student, calculating that by the time I completed my university studies, I would get my green card. Fortunately, things went according to plan, and I got my green card before my status as an international student expired.

During this time as an international student, things were very rocky with my dad. At first, I moved back in with my dad, stepmom, brother, and stepbrother. However, as the oldest, my dad and my stepmom were very strict on my 23 year old self. They imposed 11pm curfews and habitually went through my stuff without notice. About a month after I first came back, my dad told me to go back to my mom's home country. This was routine. Once they found some marijuana hidden in my car, and gave me hell for it. They were so negative with me and always told me go return to my mom's home country. My stepmom always sided with my dad saying how much of a burden I was and how I didn't have anything to show for at the age of 23. I couldn't take it, and moved out at the age of 25. I was alone in the US, with limited legal status at the time. I was dirt poor and had no family. I spent Thanksgiving and Christmas that year alone in my rented bedroom, while my family members were having a nice dinner in their home two cities away. But I was able to manage. I finished my associate's degree and got a job with the temporary work visa. I started building my life slowly, in bits and pieces. But I had to do something I didn't want to. I had to reach out to my dad, because he was my green card sponsor, and he needed to be there during the process. I did, and we somewhat rekindled our relationship. However, from my side, it was not genuine. I have all these negative experiences with him, how could I just forget about it? Anyway, I non-genuinely got along with him until the process was over. During one instance, I missed his phone call and he got angry with me because my ""voicemail wasn't set up"" so he couldn't leave a voicemail. During the same conversation I asked him to relay a message to my uncle (stepmom's brother-in-law) about something regarding the green card process, and he flipped again, saying I was always asking him for help. He hung up on me and blocked my number, even though I needed him to be present for my green card interview. This was obviously extremely stressful, as I had waited so arduously for my visa interview. If he hadn't brought me to the US as an illegal minor I wouldn't even have had the strong desire I had to live in the US. Fortunately I called my stepmom for help and she arranged it so that he would show up at my interview, which he did. I finally got my green card, which was a very happy moment.

Towards my dad however, my emotions were naturally very confused. I was supposed to be thankful for him, he was my visa sponsor. He had still helped me throughout the process. He showed up for the interview and vouched for me that I am not a fraudulent person. He also did some things to help me out during the time I was an international student: He bought me a $17k car. He spent about $16k on my university education. He gave me about $5k when I moved out.

But he was also very hard on me. He told me to leave several times. He stopped paying for my uni education after my first year, so I had to transfer to a cheaper community college, and work under-the-table to pay for school myself. All in all I earned and paid another $16k in school tuition on money earned from menial under the table jobs.

My dad has shown some progress in terms of mental growth. Not a lot, but some. He still talks about leaving his family behind and moving somewhere tropical by himself. He treats my stepmom with no respect, like telling her to shut up when he's talking and orders her around to bring food and such. My brother has told me that my dad shows some regret in how he treated me. My brother can probably smoke a marijuana joint in front of him and my dad will try to be ""cool"" with him. Obviously he is older and weaker now, and I am stronger than him, so some of this is expected. When he had all the power, and I was powerless, he beat me up and made my life hell. Now he just doesn't have that power.

This is where I am at a dilemma. I don't know how to deal with my dad moving on. Its not something I stress about. Its just something that comes up once in a while when I take long showers, or when the holidays approach. I am sure my dad wants to have a rekindled relationship with me. But always up until now, he has had the upper hand, and I've had to oblige in order to improve my life. Now that I have my life in control, I can make a fair decision whether to include him in my life or not.

I'm 29 years old now, and for the last few years I have built the beginnings of a life for myself. I have a professional career, an amazing SO that I will be engaged with soon, and will even be starting grad school next fall. I've distanced myself from my dad.

When I think about all the evil things he did, I just want to cut him out. I don't want to include him in the rest of my life. I don't want my future kids to know him. I don't want to give my dad the pleasure of knowing his grandkids either. I already introduced my SO to him, because my SO wanted to meet my parents. I did that because I wanted to make my SO happy, not my father. I didn't enjoy giving my dad the pleasure of meeting his son's SO. The only positive I can think of that will come from rekindling our relationship is that I'll have my dad and stepmom as members for future family events: Thanksgiving, Christmas cards, and such. Even as such, I would be annoyed at having to interact with him at such events.

I would consider my father to have some sort of mental disorder. He works hard and has partially provided, but is a ticking time bomb who is very destructive when prodded. He is also very uneducated, which means he has worked hard, not worked smart, and still does so going into his late 50's.

When I think of the negative stuff, I consider these options: Pressing charges and suing him. Revealing all the nasty stuff to his wife, the stepmother. Revealing the nasty stuff to my brother.

When I think of it optimistically, I still feel like there should be something done. I can't and shouldn't just forget the past and rekindle our relationship. I feel like I need to let out my thoughts. Remind him of his actions, let him know what I know and how I feel. I feel like I will need an apology, a real apology, before we can attempt any sort of reconciliation.

But knowing my dad, and his destructive temperament, I'm afraid to communicate my thoughts to him. I'm afraid he'll flip out and destroy everything that is good around him. I don't want to bring harm to his wife (the stepmother), me, or anyone else. This is a real concern for someone like my dad.

I could go about it in a neutral manner, which is what I'm doing now. Just a few texts a year, for holidays and birthdays. Maybe see each other once a year during family gatherings. But this causes me to stress about it alone. I don't want to interact with my dad, I don't want him involved in my family's future, without a firm acknowledgement and apology from him.

TLDR: Dad caused terrible childhood. Physically abusive and detrimental to childhood growth. Tried to murder me via knife stabbing twice. Helped me out sometimes (as a father is expected to do), but also caused me much mental distress. Now I'm wondering if I should cut him out completely, or allow the relationship to be rekindled.",issueswithmyparents,2019-01-22 14:51:06,3,3824,39.11,51.67,74.34,19.16,15.87,15.19,92.89,58.97,21,17.13,10.8,1.18,0.03,4.68,0.44,3.82,5.28,14.02,8.19,6.01,6.9,2.01,15.9,4.68,2.22,1.54,1.86,2.14,4.18,1.86,2.3,0.44,1.05,0.29,14.98,4.63,0.03,3.01,5.65,9.86,1.73,1.1,1.46,2.04,1.2,2.9,1.57,0.5,0.58,0.42,1.8,0.29,1.23,0.13,0.26,8.66,3.71,1.18,2.67,1.18,0.37,8.26,6.33,0.86,15.64,2.33,6.98,6.59,2.12,0.68,0.92,0.63,0.13,0.21,0.31,0.05,0.1,0.13,0.03,0.03,14.78,6.25,5.02,0.18,0,0.03,0,0.24,0.26,1.7,0.78,0.31

aivdvt,"My Stepdad, School and mental illness left me a shadow of my former self.","This is a long story, so be ready for a read.

When I was really young (3 yo) my Mom got divorced with my Dad. My Dad was on drugs and had mental problems. My mom re married to my stepdad. My stepdad is a massive narcissist. As a kid I was a trouble maker, so me and my stepdad didn't get along very well. He would often verbally/emotionally abuse me, as a kid I brushed this off. After a while my stepdad began hitting me. It rarely happened, but when it did, It was more of a beat down than a punishment. He hit me with a wooden spoon or his belt, until my ass was bleeding and I couldn't sit down for a week. Once he punched me in the head and I had to stay home from school so no one would see. My mom who is a lovely woman, didn't care because she thought he was so great. Once he forced me to eaten my own fucking vomit. As I got older, I had problems at school. One of my friends got bullied by this group of kids until he had to leave the school. The group then started targeting me. I was getting bullied and beat up after school. One time when I was getting stomped by the group of kids, a group of my friends showed up to help me out. After a massive fight in the parking lot, I managed to gain the upper hand against the main asshole. I wanted to beat the fuck out of him, but I decided that I wouldn't sink to their level. After this, the jerks left me alone. I started to make new friends, gained an interest in drama and martial arts. My life was great for a couple years, even my stepdad started acting nice to me. Eventually we moved to another city, I was devestaed because my friends were probably the only good thing in my life. This led me to become emotionally unstable, my pre existing anger problems get worse and I began suffering from depression. I quit my hobbies and became a shadow of my former self. At my new school I got bullied often, because I had become very introverted and also had a temper. This led me to get into plenty of physical fights at school. I became more angry and got into more verbal fights with my parents. Just as I began to hit an all time low. I started making new friends at my new school. However my life at home has become unbearable. Both my parents (more so my stepdad) abuse me emotionally and verbally at every chance they get, they get mad at the smallest things I do, only to use them as excuses to berate me. My stepdad said that I am horrible person, that the older I get the more he hates me, that I have no friends, that I am a loser who will end up on the street doing drugs like my real dad (Have never touched an illegal drug in my life) Eventually I lost it, told my stepdad that he was being ridiculous and turning me into a crazy person. This led to my stepdad attacking me, punching me in the chest so hard, breathing hurt for over a month. What makes it even worse was that I had a really bad pneumonia attack, nearly died. My stepdad keeps throwing it in my face that he saved my life by driving me to the hospital when ever I have an argument with him. I am scared of him, I can't fight back, as he is a massive guy with training, whereas I am short, skinny and 15. My mom takes his side in every argument.

aivhbk,Advice on Regaining Self-Esteem,"I've been through a number of toxic and abusive situations over the years, managed to salvage my confidence for the most part only to get ill and am now subject to narcissistic and abusive family members who take every opportunity to snipe my sense of self-worth they can. 

I'm continually made to feel insignificant and whenever I say anything, even something as simple as the sky is blue, I'm questioned in a way that makes me feel stupid and has me doubting myself. They know I have issues with self-confidence as I'm not exactly good at hiding it and they're obviously manipulating that against me. It's gotten to the point where I can't even have a basic thought without doubting myself and I have no faith in anything I say. I have a continual fear that I'm just wrong and incompetent and everything I do will just fall apart. I really can't handle living like this anymore and am quite desperate.

aj0wy4,was this grooming or sexual abuse?,"Ok guys, I’ve had a hard time wrapping my head around this. When I was 12 my best friends brothers best friend showed interest in me. He was 17 almost 18. We saw each other on and off for years until I was 18. We used to have sleepovers and he’d come get me out of my best friends room and stay up with me all night. I liked the attention and never thought of it as wrong but I was very naive. I never had sex with Him. I refused to, but he always tried to push me to do more. We would make out/breast play/he tried to get me to touch him down there. 
Fast forward and I’m 14. My neighbor a 19 year old boy asks me out. Same scenario. He always pushes me to go further, the relationship didn’t last long but we remained friends and started dating again when I was 17. We had sex. Were these guys grooming me? Also the 19 year old tried to get me to drink and do drugs but I was a very straight edge kid. Sometimes he would trick me into drinking. I’m now 30 and just realizing this is was so wrong. I was in denial for a long time. Was this a paraphilia on their part? Did they groom me? These men were in my life for a long time after and still are. Was I just a kid they decided to take advantage of?

aj9rxr,Is my mother abusive towards my father?,"Part of me almost feels ridiculous for even asking this question. I love my mum and she has always done what she can to provide for my big brother and I, but for as long as I can remember, she has treated my dad like shit most of the time and I can definitely see how it has worn him down over the years.

She will belittle him and shoot him down as often as she wants. Whether she's in a bad mood or not (as far as I can tell). Sometimes I'll be talking to her and she seems completely fine - up for a conversation, happy to chat away and I can even hear in her voice that she's feeling okay. Then my dad comes home and she turns cold...

Every single day he walks in the door after working all day long and he tries time and time again to make my mum feel loved and to show her he's happy to see her. You can genuinely hear his efforts just in the way he speaks to her, but she'll go from speaking to me in the light hearted way she usually does, to speaking to him like she just wants him gone and to make him feel small as often as she pleases. She'll do this right in front of me. If we're in the car having a nice conversation and she decides to phone my dad and tell him we're coming home, she'll suddenly turn cold and sour when he answers the phone. They won't argue, but usually they're calls end with him telling her he loves her and she'll just say goodbye and hang up. Often complaining about him afterwords when all he's done is treat her lovingly.

If I'm with her and she bumps into someone she knows, she'll speak to them in the kind, friendly way that I see her act in so often, but it's rare to see her even try to speak to my dad in the same way. I can see that it breaks his heart and it's clear as day that he's depressed and lonely.

They both work their ass off but my mum is in charge of the money they both make. She'll spend money on getting her hair done, her nails, eye brows, she'll buy clothes, shoes, bath products and whatever else, but if my dad was to come home with a £5 DVD he just bought for himself, he'll have to hide it or else my mum will bitch at him and unleash her stress on to him.

He has very little recreational time to himself. He golfs 12 til half 4 on a Saturday, and 8 til 12 on a Sunday morning. Other than that, my mum would most likely stop him from doing anything else - not that he even tries these days... If she wants to drink a few glasses of wine she'll do as she pleases, but if my dad has a drink on a Saturday after the golf (literally just a couple pints of beer with his mates before he comes back home) and he walks in cheery and happy, she'll chastise him and maybe even cancel their plans for the night and tell him it's his fault because he chose to get drunk. He'll come home on time, hardly even be tipsy - not slurring his words or anything, yet she'll make a huge deal out of it like with everything else, and as usual, it's his fault.

Whenever my dads sister comes up in conversation, she'll talk down about her and she'll even stop him from seeing her sometimes. He probably sees his sister about 8 times a year even though her house is a 2 minute drive from our street. It's not like he's forced to not see her, but after years of her treating him like this my mum knows exactly how to get her way in whatever way she wants. He would do anything for her and I do not say that lightly.

My dad is an amazing parent. He would give his heart and soul for his family. The same goes for my mum, but she's a really shitty wife and almost all of the time she won't show any loving kindness towards him. Sometimes she'll have a laugh with him, but still I can see that she picks and chooses when to be nice to him. It's always one sided. By this I mean that she'll sometimes speak to him with kindness in her voice, but it's only when she wants to ammuse herself and to talk to someone when no one else is there.

I'm 21 years old, still living at home, and this has been going on my entire life. I didn't even consider if the way she treats him is abusive or not until about 2 years ago as this is the way it's always been in our house. Obviously there is more to it than what I've said, but I'm trying to keep this lengthy post as short as possible in the hope that someone can be bothered to read it all and leave a comment. I'm seriously worried about my dads mental health. He's miserable, treated like shit everyday, and yet he breaks his back for his family day in and day out. There's only so much a man can take and it hurts me to see my dad being beaten down time and time again. She acts as if he's hopeless and does nothing for her when he would do anything it takes to please her. Yet she takes any chance she can to bite at him and break him down.",tigbits97,2019-01-23 22:44:48,6,958,20.54,87.88,6.93,29.25,23.95,9.5,95.62,62.53,23.59,18.58,4.49,0.42,0.1,12.94,0.63,5.01,3.65,15.34,10.02,6.47,10.13,1.25,18.06,5.22,3.34,1.46,1.36,1.88,5.01,2.51,2.3,0.31,1.04,0.52,21.82,2.71,0.21,7.93,7.72,13.05,1.57,1.04,1.77,4.7,1.77,4.38,4.07,1.57,1.67,0.73,2.09,0.94,0.31,0,0.52,5.95,2.3,0.94,1.57,0.63,0.63,1.36,13.99,3.24,16.39,1.88,7.1,7.41,0.52,1.36,1.25,0.52,0.1,0,0.63,0.52,0,0.1,0,0,13.78,4.49,3.65,0,0,0.1,0,0.31,0,4.8,0.42,0

ajdv6j,Unsure what to make of a situation that happened 7 years ago,"I don’t know if this was some kind of sexual assault, or abuse, but it’s been playing in my head and I’m not sure what to make of it. 

I’m not making a throwaway because I’m not ashamed and I don’t want to hide behind something, I want to face it head on.

Context, I was in a locker room and these men a few years older than me, I was maybe 12 at the time, felt me up? This one guy pulled my shorts down and went to go touch the stuff down there. It didn’t feel like some camaraderie or something to be funny or as a joke, it just felt overtly sexual. A few of them laughed, but this one guy was so fixated. And I really don’t know what to think of the whole thing. 

I of course reported it, and the I guess head teacher of the year asked me and my parents if we wanted to press charges for sexual assault. At the time I thought it was just them being cocky, or as a joke. But the words “sexual assault” have such a meaning these days.

ajf9rw,I feel like I can't leave,"I have been in my relationship 2 years, living together about a year. I am completely in love, but things have been really bad. People talk about abuse like it is always some monsterous person but that isn't always the case. My SO is so loving and supportive most of the time...and then a switch flips and he is the most cruel and hateful person. It has been physical 5 times total. I can never figure out exactly what sets him off. I feel so pathetic because I think that **I love him too much to ever leave.** If it was every day I couldn't take it but now I find myself getting over it quicker and quicker because I just want to go back to being loving and happy.

Every time we try to break up, I am hit with panic attacks and thoughts of suicide. I am so attached to him because as much as he hurts me, he is the only person who's opinion matters. I don't care about compliments from other guys or wanting to go out with friends I just want him to tell me I'm special and him to want to spend time with me. I know its unhealthy and wrong but I don't know how to stop it and I don't think I'm strong enough to go through the break up and endure that pain until it finally gets better possibly years down the road.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I am probably delusional but I don't know how to stop this cycle. A situation has presented itself where I can move out of state with my SO, or stay and we will break up. I know it is obvious I should not go and that I sound so dumb saying this but I feel like I would rather be sad but with him, than alone and without him even if that means no more of him putting me down or hurting me. 

How do people leave these situations? I have looked up so many studies about how a person can become like a physical addiction and that's how I feel. I can think logically but I can't bring myself to act on it. I crave his presence and touch. I'm scared of what I will do without him because I don't have close family or friends to talk to. It's hard to even get myself out of bed in the morning when we are fighting. I feel that I will spiral out of control.

I know that I sound probably so cliche and stupid and crazy and I'm sorry I just have no one to talk to and I need help.

ajjdn0,"My (33m) first sexual experience was at a very young age, now as an adult I have questions","Not sure if this post belongs in this sub, feel free to redirect me. 

My very first sexual encounter was when I was about 8 or 9 years old (can’t remember exactly). It was with a family friend, also male, the same age as me. I don’t remember exactly how it started but I remember that he initiated and showed me how to engage in manual and oral sex. 

Throughout my life I concluded that we were just two kids playing and that it was natural exploration, and then I never really addressed it because I think I was afraid of that one experience defining my sexuality. I recently got over that hurdle, and was finally hit with a realization:

We were way too young to be doing that, and how did the other boy know how to do those things??? Is it possible that he learned through being abused by someone else? Does that make me a victim of abuse by proxy?

I’m hoping that understanding this will help me move past feelings of shame and guilt that I’ve carried ever since it happened.

ajlvz0,"I think this is abuse, but I don't know how to get away from it or how to accept it.","Me (16F) and my ex (18M) have been on and off for three to four years now.


We first broke up after I confided in him about my abuse- he thought I was lying, that I was depressing. He was the first person I ever told those things to, he was my first boyfriend, he had my trust and he harshly and randomly dumped me without explaining why.

I only found out why later on, after he and his friend gave me uncalled for death threats and taunts.

He dumped me after a week, he only gave me a week.


That would be bad enough, but then he got with my friend- he found her through me.

He rubbed it in for so long.
He wouldn't let me even speak to her or be near her, he'd just give me more threats. 


Well, she dumped him after months of dating because he's a prick.


I was his only shoulder to cry on, and he just got back with me, and I went along with it, I wanted him back so he'd give me another chance.

Cue intense bs of him getting angry at me over everything, being racist and sexist towards me and just in general, pushing my interests and personality aside, forcing me to cut myself off from everyone, threatening to call the cops on me, even trying to push me to tell authority about my parents and get away from them or else he'll leave me.

We broke up a lot, but we always got back together, always by me begging and complaining since I loved him and needed him.


Fast forward- the pestering is now sexual, like if you don't do this for me, I w i l l leave you, and he did..multiple times when I said no.

He'd push himself on me, like show me himself..when I didn't ask for that.
He'd make me do stuff I didn't really want to do..


At this point, he would now threaten to kill himself or harm himself, and he admitted to dumping me just so he could do it, so that made me fight even harder not to be pushed away or have him be left alone.

I'm really suicidal at this point because of him, home abuse, circumstances, mental illness, and being very ill.

I had some attempts, and he would never learn or back off, he'd just continue to push and kick me around.

When I was away because one of these attempts, this one caused because he dumped me when I was having a gallbladder attack, he told me to go die slowly and painfully by myself pretty much..he went online, and used our relationship and a summary of me to get friends..he told some complete stranger about our sex life, about my personal info, plus he made fun of me and made me look like the abusive monster..all when he thought I was possibly dying..just to woe her.

The chick just spammed me with death threats and jabs because of the stuff he brainwashed her with..that happened after I confronted him, so he told her to go hogwild on me ig.

He wouldn't even apologise..he told me to go fuck myself and that I deserved it.

Had another buddy also tell me I'm worthless


I don't know, but over half a year later, he takes me back.

But he only gave me a few weeks before dumping me again after it was revealed that I was raped and had a miscarriage in his absence and that my friends and I weren't the biggest fans of him behind his back either during that period.

When he dumped me..he sent me more threats, called me a whore and stuff..even started cutting himself badly, and showed me when I didn't ask.


His female friend even wished for me to die when I ran away from home..congratulated me on my teenage miscarriage, and that if I even had given birth, the baby would be retarded and I'd be an awful mother..she's older than me, and she said that when I came to her in crisis.


B u t he took me back again in the beginning of this month, for reasons I still don't really know.

And guess what happened after two weeks of him kinda being an uncomfy nazi (no friends or else he'd break their necks, get upset at m e, or call em pedos), he dumps my ass again, telling me that I can't pleasure him, that as long as I'm alive and near him he'll have a massive trigger for his ""ptsd"" and depression.



I thought things were finally turning around..I thought this was it, he was listening and he changed. 
But no, I got the same ""go fuck yourself"" and arm slashing like before, but this time..for zero reason, man.

He even laughed at me and told to shut up when I was sobbing and explaining my feelings to him..that he's made me cry myself to sleep for years, that he's not being fair or kind.

I even went into the hospital because my condition was escalated by this stress..he doesn't care one bit.


Any rational person can see this is abuse..my friends all tell me this is abuse, to never talk to him again..but I don't listen to them, I think they're biased..I want to rid myself of him, but he always gets under my skin and wins my heart back.

I'm sorry if this is all jumbled and stuff..I'm just upset and it's late.


I guess I'm just asking if this is as bad as my friends are telling me, as bad as it seems..if this has happened to any of y'all..ways to get over this and stuff, idk.",abusethrowawayiguess,2019-01-24 21:31:18,1,1001,9.8,45.62,61.02,1,28.6,12.09,95.2,64.54,27.07,21.68,11.89,0.5,0.5,8.49,0.3,5.39,2.4,13.59,8.59,7.29,9.89,2.2,19.88,4.3,2.9,1.5,1.1,1.7,6.89,1.3,5.49,0.9,2.3,1.1,16.48,0.3,1,1.3,7.99,11.79,2.3,2.3,1.7,2.8,1.2,3.8,1.6,0.5,0.6,0.5,2.4,0.9,0.8,0.6,0,6.69,2.1,0.6,2.3,1.5,1.1,7.19,8.89,0.3,14.89,2.9,5.89,7.19,0.1,0.1,0.2,0.1,0,0.8,1.4,0.7,0.6,0,0.1,0.1,18.88,7.99,6.09,0,0,0,0,0.3,0.4,3.5,0.6,0
ajouca,I don’t know if I’m suppressing childhood trauma,"I don’t know how to start this, my mind is in such a mess...

I can’t remember much of my childhood before the age of six and the memories I do remember involve arguing or some sort of negativity/loneliness/sadness. I remember that my parents weren’t in a happy place and we struggled financially.

Whenever I think about my childhood and teenage years I am filled with sadness and regret. I remember my parents sometimes slapping and spanking me and my sisters but I feel like that was a common thing back then (I’m 23) and nothing too much out of the ordinary.

When I was 14 or 15 I think I suffered sexual abuse by an older guy (18 or 19 I think) and I received some help but I’ve never experienced many of the typical trauma symptoms. I do feel I’m am always alert, sudden noises make me tense up and I can be very jumpy. I don’t have flashbacks or terrifying nightmares although recently all my dreams have been very stressful or uncomfortable, I don’t remember the last time I had a happy/funny/normal dream.

Although I experienced abuse as a teenager I have always felt like my depression and anxiety existed before that. When I think about me as a child I always associate it with negative feelings, loneliness and hopelessness. I am also unsure whether I experienced abuse or not and have discussed this with a psychologist but that’s another story.

One thing that really disturbs me is that I remember being very fascinated with sex from a young age (at least 6-7ish) and even before the teenage abuse I used to think (not sure if I fantasised) about being sexually abused or having a man/men dominate me in any type of way (kidnapping, held at gun point, assaulted etc.). I also thought about any sort of scenario where I was a victim and would be saved in some way by preferably a man (illness, car accident, injury etc.). I’m not sure if this makes any sense...

I would also sexually experience with my sister when we were children and I have never admitted this before or even talked to anyone about this (her included) but we would play weird games with our friend as well which had some sort of sexual aspect to it.

I’m just very confused by my childhood and was kind of hoping that somebody here could relate or help me figure out why I have such negative and disgusting memories from my childhood. Could it be that I might have experienced some sort of trauma early in my childhood and am repressing it? Or is it maybe that I’m just an unusually weird person with disgusting thoughts?

My friend stopped him and made him let me go. He wouldn't let me go when I said no and tried to leave. He yanked me back and said ""relax"" and shit. He didn't listen to me. My fucking opinions and wants aren't worth listening to.

To replace the car we lost, my mom bought a new one, and I was to take her old one to school. I think it was this that set off a chain of events that lead to him degenerating more. About a week ago, my dad was having an argument with my mother regarding a certain other lady friend my dad had been talking to. When my dad gets mad, he acts like a toddler. Throwing things, and breaking shit. In this case, he kicked his door countless times, breaking not only the doorknob, but also the hinges. It now couldn't fully shut without being forced. About 3 days ago, I was home from school with my girlfriend, like I am every day. I hadn't spoken to my dad that day at all, haven't even seen him. But he came in angry. He called me in and said ""what have you been doing all day?"" I reminded him that I had school. He then asked why the driveway wasn't snow blowed. (At first I was confused;Did I miss a text? Did he ask me to this morning? No... No he didn't. And besides, in the past he's told me to not start up the snowblower without him being there, because one time I did and it smelled like gas. ) I told him ""Oh, I'm sorry. Did you ask me to?"" In a polite tone. He said aggressively ""DO I NEED TO TELL YOU TO WIPE YOUR OWN ASS TOO?"" I told him that I would do it first thing tomorrow morning. He seemed satisfied with that, and went downstairs to his room. He then started screaming at me, accusing me of being in his room. I hadn't even been downstairs lately, so I was confused. He kept insisting that I broke his door and that ""it wasn't that broken before."" When I told him that I didn't touch his door, he called me a liar, among other rude words. Sure, whatever, the man's old, maybe he forgot breaking his own door. Later, when my mom got home from work, she told me to go out and shovel the driveway to make him happy. At 9:00 at night. I did, but when I came back in, things weren't much better. He was still accusing me of breaking his door, and screaming at my mother. When she told him that it in fact, was himself who broke his door, he went ballistic. He screamed and screamed and screamed for hours on end. He came up in my room at 11:30 at night, got in my face, and told me that I lost all my privileges and am never aloud to touch his cars again. (Including my mother's car, which he has no control over.) Then again he came into my room while I was trying to sleep at about 1:30 in the morning (This was on a Wednesday, school and work tomorrow.) This time he told me how I was kicked out of the house as soon as I was able to be, and that ""If I ever get in his face again, he'll put me in the ground."" I said nothing. The next day I have school. My dad is adamant about my not using my mother's vehicle, so to try to soothe troubled waters my mom took me to school. For the first time in 4 years, I got a ride from my mommy, and took the bus home from school. That night he yelled some more, this time making it known to us that he had not slept in over a week. I don't know why he hasn't slept, but it was clear he was miserable, and so if he was miserable and couldn't sleep, neither could the rest of his entire family. The next day is a friday (today). Due to testing, I didn't need to go to school today. My dad came in my room early in the morning, woke me up, and screamed at me about how I should have already taken the bus and that the snow Better be taken care of. I tried to explain that I didn't need to go to school, but he wasnt hearing it. He told me to go anyway, and that I'm NOT taking the car. He told me to walk to school. I live almost 3 miles away and it's the middle of winter. Whatever, I'll go try to sedate him by taking care if the snow. I went and did it, and when I got back in he told me ""you WILL go bring in wood before you go to school"" very clearly not asking. I just said ""no problem dad"" and did that too. At this point, I didn't know what to do, because I cant just walk to school, they'd have nowhere to put me if I did. Instead, I walked to a nearby store (only about a half mile away) and asked my girlfriend's brother to come pick me up. Luckily, he did, and I was able to escape to my girlfriend's house for most of the day. Apparently, while I was gone, he and my brother had an altercation. Without my mother or me to scream at, he went after my brother. (I should mention, my brother is 21, absolutely huge, autistic and disabled.) After fighting for a bit, apparently something in  his crazy brain told him to rip mine and his doors off their hinges. Eventually things escalated and he got to shoving my brother around, and he wasnt taking any of that. He shoved my dad off of him and into a wall, and called the police. When the police came, my dad refused to talk to them. Hearing about this, my mom came home early from work. The police told her to take my brother away for a bit to let dad ""calm down"". Fast forward a few hours later, and we're at where I am now. I'm sitting in my room, and I don't have a door anymore. My mom told me to not try to put the door back on, or else dad will throw it out in the yard.  I know alot of people with abusive parents do something to anger them, wether it be disrespecting them, running away, breaking shit, whatever, but I literally haven't done anything. I try so hard to do everything he says, but he still hates me. I wish I could convey the way he looks at me and speaks to me in text form. He treats me like a slave, literally. That I'm just there to do what he says, and if I do it wrong or not at all, I'll be punished. I don't know where to go. Ideally, I'd like him out of this house, and out of our lives. I genuinely wish he were dead. Lacking that though, how do I remove myself, my mom, and brother from this situation? 

I know I probably didn't explain this completely and there's holes in the story, so feel free to ask any questions. I need help.

ak1pgt,Long post; getting away from it all...,"Hey all! I’m using a throw away. Sorry this ya long!

In a nutshell married for almost 17 years, I’m 38, husband is 47. 2 kids one is 12 and one is 1yr old.
I work and have a good income.

I was raised in an abusive family so I grew up thinking abuse was my fault... I got married and he would loose his temper... like super batshit crazy angry over minor things. Due to my history I either fought back or apologized. I never realized until like 2 years ago that his batshit temper and rage and blaming me for anything which goes the way he doesn’t like was not my fault!

So, the abuse isnt daily we go through cycles.. but I feel like the s past 2 years when we hit that plateau and something really upsets him the violence is much worse! Or maybe I’m getting older and just am fed up. I know instinctively should I leave or try to force divorce he will go absolutely nuts and get vengeful and probably try to hurt me or our kids. 

We’ve had other issues... infidelity on his end and frankly we should have divorced ages ago but hes always refused. He says he values his family and other bullshit. I know and understand it’s utter bullshit. 

2 years ago I learned of infidelity and left at night with our son, went to a shelter, got a PFA, leave from work, had the local cops involved and filed for divorce. 
During the month we lived in the shelter he stalked my mother, father and aunt; threatened them, their local police got involved! I know I can’t go to my family as no one would support my efforts to leave and he’d find us immediately.  I managed to find an apartment and we worked out a visitation plan for our son. I went completely no contact. But, stupid stupid stupid me a mutual friend got involved and talked me into making contact with him.. I did... via email just to talk abt our son at first and he lovebombed me which looking back I know is classic abusive behavior! I was eager to see if things could be fixed as he seemed as well and so we met up with our son at my moms... we talked and it seemed like he had realized the errors of his ways. That he seemed re-committed to our family.

So I came back. Therapy was a waste of time. I ended up gradually discovering more infidelity related bullshit, but he was remorseful and like most couples in this situation we didn’t think clearly. I got pregnant with our youngest. He was perfect that year.

Okay fast forward he’s slipping back into his nasty abusive ways and I’m really afraid he will either kill me or hurt me in a very very bad way or I’ll snap and vise-versa. I’m fully capable of fighting and can protect myself... I also weight life so it’s possible. And tonight he had a major blow up over a freaking computer charger. I attempted to rationalize with him but when something doesn’t go his way he becomes irrational and can and will do anything. We fought alittle and our 12yr old got involved to protect me... unfortunately because he did he turned on his 12yr old and ripped the book he was holding out of his hand causing a big gash and swelling in his one hand, he also for good measure threatened to destroy my work laptop and he broke my glasses... he’s broken multiple pairs of glasses in the past and 2 personal laptops as well. I had my work stuff hidden so that stuff was ok and I have contacts so I put those in.

But, I realized it will never get better. I want to plan my leaving better this time so it’s successful. Any ideas?
I’m done and for my kids I absolutely must leave.

My concerns are... myself, my kids and my families safety! He gets irrational and goofy... I know he will stalk them, possibly threaten them, probably threaten to harm himself because he’s so dramatic! 
I worry about a PFA... it was a pain in the arse to get and I still had to allow our son to see his dad. How do I know his dad won’t hurt him this time?

Sure I could call, find a shelter, notify the police and leave when he’s at work but I dunno if I have the emotional energy to go through the hell
I went through the first time! 

I could also contact the lawyer I saw originally but I’m stuck if he refuses once again to sign. He’s a stubborn jerk.. instead of realizing it’s better for all of us to separate he only cares that he’d be alone and how inconvenient! Can divorces be pushed through? Even if the server spouse refuses to sign? 

I dunno I just need some ideas! I’m done and ready, willing and able to leave but I need to do it smarter this time!

You can go spend your day off hanging out with your friends and not playing red dead but when I come into your room to hang out with you it's too annoying for you to play with me there.You just do whatever you want but you never wanna do what I want because I don't matter.So im going to spend all night tomorrow not being able to sleep over all this dumb shit because only you matter and only your feelings count.

ak32he,My pretty much complete story of childhood abuse,"This may be long, since I've gone through a lot. I'm sorry if this seems all over the place.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, My name is Emma. I am 17 years old and have had a lot of abuse in my life(obviously since I'm writing this). My dad didn't show up to my birth, even though he was right across town. He simply wanted to keep working, even though my mom was in labor for 12 hours. My dad has always been distant, I don't think he ever really wanted me to be quite honest. But that's a whole other can of worms. Growing up, I had a really difficult family to get along with. Half the family hated the other half, with literal generations of abuse and mental illness on our hands. Let's start with my mother, shall we?  My mother, having gone through abuse in her childhood, has seemingly grown a complex that she can't do wrong as long as it's not as bad as her own abuse. She'd pinch my butt, make comments on my boobs, once even made fun of me for asking why I mattered. Called me broken for not wanting to wear ponytails and berets in my hair, etc. She also is the one who brought my stepdad into the abusive mixture. He is, by far, the most abusive one in my story. He'd belittle me and my mom, was staring straight at my face when he was having sex with my mom(we were sharing a room at the time) when I was around 11. He once picked up my cat and threw her outside and I can still hear the thud as she hit the ground sometimes. He locked me in my room for hours one time after he made me move all of my stuff in to another room. I sat in there and cried for a long time before I just fell asleep. I even suspect that he drugged me when I was around 13-ish. But that doesn't put  an end to my sexual abuse. When I was 6, my cousin was staying with my family. We would lock ourselves in the bathroom sometimes and just talk, which wasn't bad, but one day he said that he wanted to take a shower, so I got up and tried to leave. He put his arm on the door and wouldn't let me leave. He then started stripping and this is where my memory starts getting really fuzzy and that scares me to no end. I once sobbed into my moms shoulder telling her about it. My cousin committed suicide in 2017, so I'll never get to ask him about it since I repressed it for so long. Not to mention my cousins(separate cousin from the last) left a porn tab open on the computer after he had used it. He didn't even make an attempt to ask for the computer back for a minute so he could delete it either, which makes me think that he did it on purpose. I used to make my toys have sex at the age of 8-9. My aunt, cousin, her boyfriend, and my aunts boyfriend would all smoke meth around me with nothing but a sheet to protevt me from it. And my mom is the same one who left me there in that meth-house with a nearly 103 fever so she could go have sex with some guy. She'd regularly bring me to hookups with guys when I was barely 9 years old.

Even before I had a concept of abuse, I already knew that I did *not* want to be anything like my dad when I became a parent. Even as young as third grade I would check my behaviors and try my damndest to be the furthest thing from my dad.

My sister, on the other hand, grew up to become exactly like our abusive father. I don't want to get into more details right now because it's very hard to talk about, but the gist of it is she's become *exactly* like our abusive father. And when we try to tell her she's acting like our dad, she either doesn't listen, plays it off, or makes *us* seem like the bad guys when she does something hurtful. Again, even at a young age, I constantly checked my behaviors and did everything to be *not* my dad. My sister, who claims to hate him the most, ended up exactly like him and refuses to see it.

**Tl;dr** My sister has become exactly like our abusive father, and claims that she's nothing like him.

ak7sij,Am I right to feel anger/sadness?,"I told my mother that I had two friends die recently and that is why I didn’t do so good this past semester at university. Instead of saying something normal, she started asking questions. To clarify, she asked them in a way that was more like an interrogation (trying to get information) than actually caring about the situation. Anyways, like 2 weeks later, she said that school may not be for me. Thinking she may have forgotten about my situation, I mentioned again that I had two friends die. She then told me that I didn’t have any friends die because she asked a friend who worked at my school if anyone died and that person said no one did. This can be refuted by the fact that the yearly list of students who died (we have a ceremony each year) is always around 20. So she is obviously lying to me about this because she wanted to catch me in a lie about something so big (the death of two friends).

ak8i7h,I dont know,"I don't know if I'm being abused. To preface this, my mom divorced my dad when I was seven-ish, and did not give him custody. I'm not really sure why, but it might have been because he was a little but physically abusive.  But, now I visit him every weekend and trust him more than anyone else in my family. 
  My mother tends to say stuff about my appearance (usually how I dress or do my hair) like, ""oh you look like crap, people are going to call social services"". I was wearing sweatpants when she said this. They were fresh out of the laundry so I'm not sure what I did wrong. This repeats very often.
    I cut my hair short last year for reasons. Since then, she will constantly belittle me for how I do my hair. She'll tell be I look homeless, unkept, depressed, like I hate myself and i don't take care of basic hygiene. All because she doesn't like how short my hair is. 
   Also, recently she noticed self harm marks on my hands. She basically called me an ""emo loser"" and made me feel ashamed of what SHE made me feel about myself. She also continuously ignores my cries for help for therapy, even though we can afford it.
    Basically, I'm in a position where I'm no longer able to stand it. I want to go live with my dad but he doesn't have custody of me, and I'm not sure how he can.

akahdf,dad &amp; step mom kick me out for telling my partner they abused me + go through whole phone,"I am 17, about to be 18 in a little over a month. My lovely partner and I vent to each other all the time about our problems. We have never had any issues with this, and have only benefited from sharing stories of our mistreatment with someone who understands.

A lot of times, those stories involve my dad and step-mom. Either what is happening at the moment, or what happened years ago. Maybe I'll get into the full extent of their abuse someday, but for now this is all you need to know.

Fast forward to the second week of winter break. I'm spending the week with my dad and step-mom. I, of course, continue venting to my partner, this time about everything from the ""phone contract"" they greeted me with, to the racial slur my step-mom used.

I was up at 3 am that Saturday, which they did not like. So, upon discovering this, my step-mom took my phone. I went to sleep anxious, but at least assured that they did not know the pattern to get into it. 

I wake up to find that my dad and step-mom had somehow gotten into the phone (which my mom, who has full custody, pays for).  This was all while I was sleeping. Then they confronted me, telling me I was disrespecting them and making my partner not want to meet them. They accused me of lying about the events I recounted in my messages (spoiler: I wasn't). They also got mad at me for telling my mom they planned on taking my phone at 8 pm, which she had previously told me she wouldn't allow *because* we didn't trust them with it.

They told me they wouldn't be so hard on me and they would respect me if I respected them. They demanded an apology. I didn't give one, nearly told them they never apologized to me for all the years of abuse. Eventually, they handed my phone back. Every. Single. App. Was opened. Then, just like when I was 14 and struggling with diagnosed depression and anxiety, they kicked me out. They said I can visit, that they'll have no rules because they are ""the fun parents now"" (they've always been jealous that I prefer my mom and think it's because she has ""no rules"").

Bonus: they also kicked my autistic brother out. He didn't understand what was happening and thought he was going to Mom's for the weekend. I was so terrified to speak that I couldn't tell him otherwise. The only thing he brought was a container filled with toy cars.",pansexualpantaloon,2019-01-27 00:53:52,9,457,24.93,66.92,83.79,13.83,14.28,15.97,94.09,59.74,24.95,19.04,10.72,0.88,0.22,1.53,5.69,5.91,4.16,13.13,8.97,4.81,6.13,2.84,18.16,2.19,0.66,1.97,1.75,2.63,4.81,1.97,2.84,0.88,1.53,0.22,19.69,3.5,0.88,2.84,1.97,11.6,2.19,1.31,1.97,1.97,2.19,2.84,1.97,0,1.75,0.22,0.88,0.66,0.22,0,0,7.88,3.06,0.44,2.63,1.53,0.44,7.66,7.66,1.53,14.66,2.84,5.91,6.56,0.44,0.66,0,0.66,0,0,0.22,0,0.22,0,0,0,19.69,6.78,4.81,0.44,0.22,0,0,1.09,1.31,2.84,1.31,0.88

akd09e,I'm just not sure if I'd been abused or not and can't stop thinking about it.,"First of all, this is a throwaway because my bf knows my real account and I'm not ready to speak with him about this yet. English is not my native language so I apologize in advance if my text contains mistakes or my sentences are a mess. If this is the wrong subreddit for this post, please let me know so I can delete/crosspost. I'm 27F.

Second thing, this is gonna be a long one because I have to write everything down in order to give you proper insight and to document it for myself. Hope that's okay, sorry in advance.

So, for some years now, I've been wondering if I have experienced something bad in my childhood. Something that comes close to wrong sexual behavior towards a kid. And if it still affects me now. 

I have two memories that somehow give me a bad feeling and I don't know what to do about it. They're only shreds of memories though, so I can't say how old I've been and what the context was. First thing is, I remember sleeping in my parent's bed. (I've always been a very close-to-home kid and didn't want to be separated from my parents for too long, so it was normal for me to cuddle with both my mom and my dad.) I kind of remember being ""spooned"" by my father and I remember the way he breathed (kinda... hard, the way you'd breathe when you're ""into it"") and I think I also felt a movement from the hips, but I'm not too sure about this. What I know for sure is I felt uncomfortable in this very moment. I remember this small fraction of a scene very often and I caught myself wondering whether my father masturbated while having me close. I do not remember being touched or where my mom was at this moment, but she was not in the bed with us. 

The second thing I remember is my mom asking me whether my dad has touched me inappropriately. Again, I do not remember any context, just her asking me this. I still see her in front of me and asking me, she was upset and very serious about this. To this day, I wonder if I remember this correctly, if she really asked me about my father, or if it was about being touched by someone in general. But I know for sure we had a conversation (that I think I started!) about this and she wanted me to tell me the truth. I can recall I said ""No"" and changed the subject. 

I know that for my mom, the worst possible thing to happen to her kids is sexual abuse. Since I'm a grown-up, we've had a few talks about it (I'm still very close with my mom) and she told me on multiple occasions that she's absolutely horrified by the thought of me or my siblings being raped or abused. I once asked her - maybe two years ago - if something similar had happened to me. If I ever had said something, if she can remember something, but she said she didn't. But she said that this has always been her worst fear.

Also, there are other things that confuse me very much. I've scrolled though posts in this and other subreddits about sexual abuse against kids and read some points that apply to me. For instance, I vividly remember dreams in which I have sex with my dad - and enjoy it. When I wake up I'm absolutely disgusted and confused. But these kind of dreams reoccur every once in a while. Also I know I've had a time as a kid (arund 11-12 years old) where I had to pee almost every 20 minutes. I know my younger brother had this, too. And I remember complaining to my mom about my genitals being itchy and sore, she bought a cream at the pharmacy for vaginal yeast infection, which I used every day for quite a long time. 

All of these occurances became obvious to me when I started to bond with my now bf. I started dating him when I was 23, he was my first boyfriend and also the first person I've slept with, so I was a rather late bloomer. And it took me a long while until I could finally trust him. I was terribly afraid of sex, I'd been masturbating quite often before, but sex was a whole different thing. I was scared of being hurt, scared of being used, scared of feeling dirty and ashamed afterwards. It was at this point when I noticed that this kind of trust you build and learn as you grow from being a baby, this ""basic trust"", was utterly broken. At least my trust in men. To this day, I feel weird after I've had sex with my bf. He's the most loving, careful bf in the world and I genuinely love him, but I can't help but feel kinda ashamed.

I was in therapy for 4 years from 14 to 18 because of panic and anxiety issues and took mild anti depressants. From 20 to 22 I was in therapy again, and since 2016 I've visited my psychologist every now and them for the same reasons. I have asked her too if she thinks that maybe something has happened to me that my mind just keeps hidden and tries to forget, but she says she doesn't think so. During our sessions, we mostly speak about my dad, because as there are many things about his behaviour that make life miserable for my family and I, but there never are any sexual references.

I just can't figure this out. I've been asking myself thouse questions for years without being able to find an answer. Reddit, is my mind playing tricks on me? Are these symptoms I have (e.g. disturbing dreams) really the signs for abuse? Am I just weird when it comes to sex? Is it possible that I've actually been abused and my mind just blocks the memories? Do all these mental health problems I've had since I was a kid have a deeper reason than anyone could know? Or am I just crazy, or - am I just normal? At some nights (just like yesterday night when I read a post about an abusive father on Reddit again) I can't sleep, because I think about this all over again and again. I just don't know what to do anymore. 

Advice very welcome. Thanks in advance, Reddit. 

P.S.: Also, I really really want to apologize to anyone who suffered from actual abuse. If I'm just being crazy, or if this has nothing to do with abuse, please don't think it was my goal to diminish what you've been through.",FarJacket,2019-01-27 07:37:58,2,1151,11.22,17.85,94.95,3.45,17.44,13.55,95.05,62.55,23.28,15.99,12.51,0.43,0.52,2.43,0.09,7.3,3.74,11.9,10.86,8.34,9.12,2,19.2,3.65,1.39,1.74,1.82,1.82,5.82,1.74,4.08,1.3,0.96,0.43,10.08,1.74,0.43,2.26,2,17.29,4.78,1.39,2,5.3,2,5.73,2.09,0.26,0.7,1.04,2.87,0.96,0.78,1.22,0.09,5.3,1.91,0.87,1.3,0.52,1.13,7.04,10.86,0.17,12.25,1.13,4.43,6.43,0.61,0.7,0.35,0.17,0,0,1.13,0,0.87,0.26,0,0,16.94,5.65,4.34,0.09,0,0.52,0.09,0.7,0.7,3.56,1.22,0.09

Then I got advice from this piece of shit who said we just need to love our abusers more, they are just hurting more and need more love. That fucking bullshit but it didn't help.
After I reported him I still wanted to protect him. But I hate him. He made me fall all sorry for him...I dunno what this is. I want this icky disgusting feeling gone.

akjjf5,"Hi, thank you if you read this","I was a happy child when i was growing up. I had loving mom and dad, my dad never spend much time with me, but he was home most of the time. And my mom and dad never married but had me then broke up. Couple years after they had me when i was 4 or 5 i asked my mom and dad to get back together and to my joy they did. I always thought as a kid a mom and dad should be together, but sadly that single decision was possible the worst of my life. 

Flash a couple years forward and my dad has a job where he essentially gets pushed around and is fed up with there shit. Well after a party one night my dad was drunk and while my mom was driving he grabed her by the hair and said, ""I BET YOU SUCKED RICHARDS DICK DIDNT YOU."" While my mom is swerving on the road trying to keep us from going in a ditch. And im in the back crying not knowing what my dad was doing. My mom yells at him to tell him im in the back and to please stop for my sake, and he just looks back at me and continues like he didn't even care about me. My mom pulles into a convient store and askes the woman, that came out to help, to call the cops then he stopped and let her drive away. 

This was the fist of the many times he beat my mom and mentally abused me. He slamed things down on my moms head as she was crawling towards me loking for me to help as i was just standing there crying, and then my mom had to one time hide behind me while i was taking a shower and that was the only time he didnt beat my mom when he was about to. Then when i was 12 or 13 he was stomping around my moms house while he looked like he was about to abuse my mom, then he just looked at me, while i was doing nothing, and said ""you are not my son."" I burst into tears, and at the time i was so use to the abuse i didnt even know why i was crying.

This abuse happend for about 10 years. Then i learned the reason my dad did all of this was because he was high on drugs and thougt he could do whater the FUCK he wanted. And the thing im pissed about is how he never got jail time. When he got clean of drugs everybody clapped and cheered him on while i had to live with the hell the was still brewing in my head when i fucking cried at night. 

And my theropist has told me i need to forgive my dad for what he did because he is trying to right his wrongs, and it's true he is, but i still cant let go of how he ruined my fucking childhood and now he should just be let off the hook no strings. Like the horrible things he did were just ok and now we can just move on. 

My main question is should i forgive him because all ive ever wanted is a dad but i hate to just let what he did slide?

aklwhc,"I’ve recently realized that I’m in a severely dependent, abusive relationship and i need help getting out","This is rambling I’m sorry i don’t have much time to make sure it’s better. When i moved to the city i found a temp job at a popular old school strop club. Waitressed, worked 2 or 3 6/7hr shifts a week and made roughly 4-8g a month. I am not very materialistic and I’m good at saving. I paid down some of my debts financed a car and lived a good life traveling and what not. Started hanging out with this dancer and eventually met her dealer friend. We got it off. His house became the hangout spot because free weed and a few blocks from the club. It’s hard to stay sober st the club or keep a distance. If your not involved enough you get treated different. Idk. It’s a shitty environment but big money fast even if your not taking off your clothes or sucking dick. I’m not good at casually dating. I had just ended a relationship and i have a dumb high libido and he seemed chill enough for a fab situation. I’ve done it before and it’s always worked out. Fast forward 6 months and i haven’t spoken to my friends in months. Quit my job. Sold my car. Spend every second walking on eggshells trying not to fuck up. My family loves him. He’s so nice. He takes care of me. Treats me great. It’s weird though. He doesn’t have interest in sex with me even when I’m desperate enough to try it’s always a no. He watches a lot of porn with girls that look nothing like me. Idk. I get hit on fairly often. Still do even though i don’t wear makeup and now dress pretty baggy. I used to feel great about myself. Now i wonder if something’s wrong with me all the time. He won’t touch me but he’s always accusing me of sleeping with someone else. Glance at someone, I’m cheating. It’s so confusing. A majority of the time i spend wondering how i got so ugly for someone to not even be interested in me. It drives me nuts that i can’t stop obsessing over it now. I feel stupid. When we start arguing if I’m quick enough sometimes i can start voice recording on my phone before he notices. A few times I’ve had to stay home because of the bruises. A few times i honestly thought I’d die. Every time i tell him this is toxic and i want to break up he gets angry. We fight. Sometimes I’m so exhausted i just scream I’m sorry and tell him i love him and if we stop fighting I’ll forget everything. It’s humiliating but i have kids. At first it was just pushing and shoving now it’s throwing me around, rage and violence, and not to mention stalking me. Sometimes I’m too afraid he’ll lose control and kill me. I finally convince him to let me get a job. I don’t have set break times although their often similar and i can’t have phones at my desk. If he calls and i don’t answer right away he immediately assumes I’m with someone. He’ll blow up my phone. There’s been times where he’ll drive the 40 mins to my work just to check on me. My building is completely secure. Can’t even get into main entrance without a badge thankfully. Even so, how embarking is it to have him there threading to Cassie a scene if i don’t come out. Thankfully he’s never done anything. How embarrassing would it be to explain this to my boss. He’s scary i don’t know what he’ll forever. I don’t want i go out like that so i say sorry. My ex husband will let me stay with him. We get along. But my bf knows where he lives. One time i wouldn’t let him in and he took a crow bar to the front door to pull me out. He has no limits. I don’t have enough money save. I don’t have friend or family here. I don’t have anywhere to go where he won’t find me. I don’t have an alternate job lined up that’s anywhere near as good as this one. I feel so sick being stuck. Where do i even begin?! He’ll find me and he’ll kill me for betraying him. Ive never let anyone treat me like this. I was a counselor for victims. I volunteered in homes to help people in this same situation. How the fuck did i not see this?! I can’t leave my kids again, or my city or job. I have no vehicle or savings. I have mental disabilities and weed helps keep me sane. The only way i deal with being here is being high and he keeps me high. How do i get away and quit being an addict at the same time. It’s too much. I’m so lost. I wish i knew where to start. My ex husband has a house and the kids live with him. I’m there often but he can manage without me. I just think if i leave he’ll terrorize my family and then my kids are gonna wonder why i disappeared. We’re not rich but they’re good kids. We had a bad life. They’re sheltered. I fuck up a lot but i always out my responsibilities first. Functioning addict or whatever. I can’t leave them and my ex thinks I’m over exaggerating. No one knows how dangerous he really is. Even with my bruises as proof I’ve been manic all my life they just think I’m exaggerating. This time I’m serious. He’s going to end up killing me. I had a fucked up life but I’ve been a good person. I know I’m stupid. Just leave is not a good answer it doesn’t work like that. I’m scared. Sometimes i feel like letting him just kill me because i can’t take it anymore. I can’t call the cops. I have no one. Please if you have any idea help me. I want to get out alive.",Throwit457893,2019-01-28 01:34:43,5,1033,9.98,12.07,95.47,8.45,9.84,11.62,93.71,58.86,22.75,18.3,13.55,0.68,0.48,3.29,0.29,4.45,4.36,9.97,11.33,6.78,7.84,4.55,22.65,4.45,1.55,1.74,1.26,1.36,7.36,2.9,4.36,0.87,2.03,0.48,10.94,0.48,0.39,0.19,4.16,13.84,2.81,1.36,1.55,4.55,1.55,5.03,1.74,0.48,0.68,0.58,2.81,0.48,1.26,0.77,0.19,9.49,2.9,1.45,2.52,2.42,0.68,3.48,17.04,1.55,14.62,2.42,6.58,6.1,1.55,1.16,0.77,1.16,0,0.58,1.45,0.68,0.39,0,0,0.19,18.59,9.87,0.68,0,0,0.19,0.19,0.1,0,7.45,0,0.1

akqwvn,Just want confirmation I guess.,"I (18M) live with my toxic mother, she has always been emotionally manipulative and abusive to my father who about 6 months ago left her after 16 years marriage due to this and also to me ofc this is just me saying so let me describe the things she does/ has done.

She has always needed to be involved with everything I do socially and often takes charge so I even as a kid at my own birthday parties (which she organised around things she wanted to do) was pushed to the back and out of attention, undiagnosed with anxiety at the time I didn't mind this but growing up she and my father (at the time) always called me a liar and ""boy who cried wolf"" because I always felt sick (anxious) before infant school all the way through primary and highschool, when it got so bad I went into paralysing panic attacks in year 10 my dad knew I had to get checked since he had then dealt with his own ptsd related to work incident a few years prior and that's when me and my dad started getting along, my mom refused the diagnosis by the doctor said I was lying and faking still and gave me shit for it alot and occasionally would hit me over petty incidents which rarely happened because I would never just roll over and would fight back, my mom became an alcoholic shortly after this due to my uncles suicide and would constantly get drunk, come home late and verbally abuse my father till he was in tears and screaming for her to leave him alone which she would then follow him around the house continuously doing so and later come at me.

Since my dad left she has taken even less of an interest in my life as a person and only talks to me to get information about him, now for the past 4 days she has refused to cook me food as she does my brother and herself and won't let me eat anything in the house over petty chores I haven't had time to do due to trying to get a job (she's home all day) which lead to the fight that made me write this post where I tried making myself something and she looks at me tells me no she's not doing anything for me and I have to right to food there and then blames me for her mental state and how I'm the source of her problems and how I should leave (knowing I have nowhere to go. 

Through all she does or lack there of she cries and swears she loves me and cares for me but I just don't believe it despite everyone else saying so aswell due to how she is behind closed doors. 

I know this abusive behaviour but I guess I want to hear it from others cause no one on her side of the family will believe me when I tell them and same as friends who have met her, she puts on tears when it comes to family and then they all go to her side and blame me, my father is the only person I can confide in properly about her behaviour.

Sorry if this is hard to follow, I'm abit of a state.",TheAndroidGillo,2019-01-28 11:21:21,0,564,24.36,54.25,66.65,1,80.57,11.17,95.04,61.35,21.63,16.49,10.28,0,0,5.85,0.35,5.14,3.9,14.36,8.51,6.74,10.46,1.6,19.68,3.55,1.77,2.66,0.89,1.24,5.32,0.71,4.61,0.53,2.3,1.06,15.07,2.66,0.18,5.32,2.84,12.06,1.95,2.3,2.3,1.95,2.13,1.95,1.42,0.18,0.89,0.35,2.66,0.18,1.42,0,1.06,6.21,1.77,0.71,1.95,1.42,0.53,5.5,11.35,1.06,17.55,3.01,6.03,8.69,1.42,1.06,1.42,0,0,0.18,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,0,7.09,1.24,1.77,0,0,0,0,0,0.35,1.6,1.95,0.18
akssmp,How can I help her,"This isn’t my story, I want to know what I can do to help my girlfriend. She is 17 and suffers from depression. She’s lived in a toxic household her whole life. She has gone through more than I could even imagine. She was abused and raped by her father growing up. She’s been in the same situation with ex boyfriends too. All of her life she has been suffering some kind of abuse. Now she lives with her mom and her boyfriend. Her moms boyfriend is a childish piece of shit. In the past he has put his hands on her in many different ways. He physically and verbally abuses her. Every time she walks into that house she breaks a little more inside. She gets scared to even leave her room. Her mom knows everything that he does to her yet still chooses to be with him. It’s crushes me to see her going through this and there’s not much I can do because I live 30 minutes away and only see her every week or so. I can’t rush to her if something happens.

akwv25,I feel guilty I didn't do anything about it,"I was abused as a child, I didn't do anything about it. It keeps me up at night, I am scared more children can be hurt.

I don't even know when it began. The abuser was always the same, but the abuse evolved over the years. Here is what happened, sorry it is going to be long...

When I was born my parents lived away from their families and worked all day. I started kindergarden at 3 months old. When they erre able to move closer to their families each side would take turns taking care of me. I was a much more open and smiling child when I was with my mother's side, when I started talking, which wasn't much time after our family moved I told my parents what was going on. My father's brother was beating me up, everytime I was in the house. My grandmother would be in the house with us and do nothing to stop it. My parents immediatly forbade me to stay over with them and inrolled me in school again, my grandparents from my mother's side, who worked shifts, as did my parents, would pick me up and drop me at daycare everyday.

For years everything was fine. I was a smart child, not very sociable, but had my close group of friends. I loved drawing, singing, animals. I wanted to be a vet and my grades were great, even being granted an award by the district (good students from that district was not very commun...).

Then when I was around 10 or 11 my parents got divorced, and that's when it started again. At first it was fine. My dad was always around, so nothing happened. Then he started dating and I was left for second plan. He would leave me alone with his brother for hours. That's when he started to, what now I know was grooming me.

I wont go into detail into what it was exactly but what it disturbed me most was when we went to visit extended family and my 6 year old cousin asked me some weird questions about what he'd when we were alone. He hadnt tried to touch me... Yet

A couple of months later I don't remember why the hell I was alone with him in the house but I was. I just remember that I ran outside to the yard crying. The fences and the walls to the street and the neighboors were high so I remember that I sat in a spot I knew people could see from outside and I just sat there crying for a good time, waiting for my dad. His brother came and tried to get me to go inside, but at the time I had a small dog that was on the yard with me and he didn't let him get anywhere near me.

By the time my dad arrived with his now wife I was just numb, siting on the floor petting the dog. I didn't tell him what happened. I didn't tell anyone for years. I only told two of my best friends and a ex-boyfriend.

I refused to see the family from my father's side anymore. He would force me, but I would have panic attacks and we'd have to come home sooner. I didn't get along with his wife either, so since the age of 15, I haven't talked with him or seen him.

My grades began to drop, I stopped singing, I would spend days in my room. I developed an eating disorder, and I had depression. My mum just thought I was being a moody teen. She never knew and she still doesn't know. I could never get it together again, I never got to be a vet.

I let it ruin me. My life went completly downhill. And then I remember my cousin with that talk, those questions... I was a child, yes, but I was 12, she was 6, and I know he used to visit that side of the family quite often. Plus I have other cousins that he can get access to as well. I am so scared something might have happened to them as well, and I don't know what to do. It has been more than 13 years since it happened to me, I am scared of people not believing me, or ignoring it?? 

I hope I am only exagerating and it was a one time thing. I need to believe that. Otherwise I feel kind of like and accomplice...",souriscoccinelle,2019-01-28 21:29:26,6,765,18.07,25.66,97,10.8,15,12.16,95.82,62.35,23.14,17.12,13.07,0.65,0,2.75,0.65,6.01,4.84,12.42,11.63,6.01,7.32,2.88,23.01,4.18,2.22,2.75,1.57,1.57,5.1,1.96,3.14,0.78,0.65,1.18,12.16,3.92,0.52,1.18,3.53,10.98,2.35,0.78,1.57,2.22,1.57,3.27,1.18,0.39,0.26,0.52,0.52,0,0.26,0,0.13,10.2,4.31,1.18,2.75,2.09,0.26,11.24,8.37,1.31,17.91,2.48,6.54,9.02,1.18,1.31,1.7,0.13,0.13,0,0.52,0.13,0,0.13,0.26,0,15.95,7.84,4.84,0,0,0.26,0,0.13,0,2.61,0.26,0
al178e,My dad makes me feel icky - need advice,"I'm 36yo, female. This post is about my father. Relationship-wise it's been complicated. On and off for the last 36 years. Let me explain.

My parents divorced when I was about 1. I may or may not have visited him before I was 7, but that's all I can remember. I was sent to him usually during the summers for about a month as per the child custody arrangement.

Visits were traumatic. He was an alcoholic and physically abusive to my stepmother during visits. At around age 13 I was able to choose not to visit. So, I didn't. I visited one more time when I was around 16. During that visit I helped my secretly move out while he was gone for a weekend. He pulled a gun on her and threatened to kill her. We escaped clean thankfully.

Later in my life around age 30 (when I had my first child) I had realized I'd let go of a lot of my anger and bitterness towards him and invited him back into my life.

Since then, despite the fact that I really do feel like I've forgiven him, I can't shake this strange dark feeling I always get when I hear his voice, or have to be with him. I never feel comfortable around him at all.

I was sexually molested when I was 8. The same feelings I had with the perpetrator (a cousin) after that, are the same exact feelings I get with my dad.

My dad sexually abused my step sister as well.

I deal with depression and anxiety on the daily. And more recently I've started trying to do things that serve me. I don't want a relationship with him anymore. But I feel awful because I don't know how to tell him that I don't want a relationship because I'm convinced that he sexually abused me as an infant. Or something. Something happened and every single time I hear his voice, see his name, have to be with him, I feel like there's a dark stone in my stomach. My heart races. My palms sweat. And I don't know why. I don't think want to.

So, what do I do? We haven't spoken in like 6 months which is normal because neither one of us make a huge effort to always keep in touch (and he's not on the internets). And now he's calling me. And I just freeze. I can't answer the phone. I'm completely door slamming him and I feel terrible about it.

Do I just continue with a pseudo-relationship? Do I let it go? Help?

TLDR: My dad doesn't know I think he sexually abused me before I was old enough to remember. And now I don't want a relationship with him, and don't know how to explain to him why or even if I should.",vanilla-bean,2019-01-29 07:40:06,10,486,15.46,25.5,96.23,3.76,11.05,13.37,95.06,62.35,23.46,19.75,13.99,0.62,0,5.14,0,3.7,4.73,13.17,11.73,6.38,8.02,3.5,21.19,4.94,3.29,2.26,2.47,1.44,4.32,1.03,3.29,0.62,1.65,0.21,13.79,2.06,0,1.03,5.76,15.43,5.35,2.06,1.44,2.47,1.85,3.5,4.32,0.62,1.23,2.26,2.47,0.82,0.82,0.82,0.21,5.35,2.47,0.82,1.65,0.41,0.41,5.56,14.4,0.62,15.43,3.09,4.32,8.02,0.21,0.41,0.21,0,0,0.21,0.41,0,0.21,0,0.21,0,18.11,8.02,2.47,0.21,0,0.82,0,0.62,0,4.73,1.23,0

al3o08,I don’t want to speak to my abusive grandmother but when she confessed to our lawyer she was sad my sis and I don’t talk to her I felt bad.,"Ok so long story short:

-my parents divorced

-my mom left the house

- i stayed home (i was  17 ) &amp; my dad was abusive physically verbally, and almost sexually (i ran away when I felt the situation was going to escalate)

- my grandma believed my dads story that I abandoned him. 

- Never asks If i needed help and justifies my dad behavior by “he was hurt by the situation”.

- dad kills himself a few years later...grandma does not speak to me at the funeral.

- sues me bc she loaned money to my dad and wants me to pay it back even though when this “loan” happened I was not in touch with either of them.

- doesn’t pay my rent dividend in a building since our dad died even tho 1/3 of the building is rightfully ours.

- today at the trial apparently she complained to the lawyer that “ it really saddens her that my sister and I don’t talk to her”.

seriously??

I feel bad bc shes almost 90 and I do see my dad in her (and I do have also very sweet memories from both of them) at the same time...i have nothing to say to her.

why should i feel bad? I accept she has done the decisions shes made, but sorry I cant forgive. Forgiveness implies the person recognized they did something wrong, she does not recognize at all shes done anything wrong in all this.

What do you make of this? I feel anger mixed with sadness for the whole situation.",throwawaybcdef356,2019-01-29 11:29:01,1,288,18.15,54.16,60.33,1,20.57,14.24,94.44,59.72,23.96,20.14,11.81,1.04,0.35,5.9,1.04,3.82,4.51,11.11,9.03,6.25,6.6,3.47,17.01,3.82,1.04,1.74,1.39,2.08,7.29,1.74,5.56,0,1.39,1.74,18.4,5.21,0,5.9,3.47,15.62,5.21,2.78,1.74,2.08,1.39,3.47,4.17,0.35,1.04,2.43,1.04,0,0.35,0.35,0.35,5.21,2.08,0,1.74,0,1.74,6.6,10.76,0.69,9.72,1.39,5.56,3.47,1.74,0,1.04,2.43,0.35,1.04,1.74,0,1.04,0.35,0,0,18.4,5.9,1.04,0.35,0.35,1.39,0,3.12,2.08,1.39,2.08,0.69

But now, I am trying to do this soon because she put in our taxes together and plans to use the money to move from our shitty apartment to a new home.

I have no other family to go, my friends can barely help me, and my boyfriend's family already abuse him to where he came to live with me to get away from that. I'm not as worried about where to go or the money to get buy essentials since I'm trying to work that out.
My issue is trying to find a time to leave since she's not always abusive and a plan to leave and make sure I don't need to come back.

al9rgt,My Brother Tried Breaking into My Parent's House,"So, my brother is extremely abusive. Growing up, he used to take his anger out on me by beating me up. When it first started happening, my parents tried to intervene and stop him but after a while, they just let it happen without stopping him. The abuse got so bad that he broke both of my arms and as a result, both my arms are hyperextended. I remember when I started school, my mom threatened that if I  told someone what was happening at home, something bad would happen to me, so I never did tell anyone. I now wish I did. He doesn't physically abuse me anymore but he is verbally and emotionally abusive. I'm in therapy right now for anxiety and depression as well as for trauma the abuse caused me. My parents are also verbally and emotionally abusive and to make matters worse, they will do anything to protect my brother from getting in trouble no matter what. I still live with my parents but I'm trying to get a job and move out but I've been struggling to find a job since I have no job experience.

My brother lives with my aunt and last night he got in a fight with her. He left her house and walked down to my parents house. My mom didn't want to let him inside so she locked the door. My brother smashed this window on the door to try to get in. There was glass everywhere and it was extremely frightening. I asked my mom if I should call the police and she said if I did, not only would I be kicked out but she would lie and say that I was the one who broke the window. One of the reasons why my parents are scared to get law enforcement involved with my brother is because he has autism and they are worried the cops would hurt him or my brother would try hurting himself. After he broke the window, my brother apologized for what happened and agreed to pay for the window. But my brother seems to not be able to comprehend how dangerous his actions were, he just says it was an accident. I was able to take a few pictures of the broken window and a few videos, in one of the videos I have my mom on camera saying she would lie to police and say I was the one who broke the window instead of my brother.

I am extremely scared right now. My brother's mental health is getting worse and I'm worried he may try hurting himself or someone else. My mom also said that a few days ago, he took 7 ibuprofen to try to stop his heart. My parents are trying to get him committed to a hospital but that might not happen. I told my therapist what happened and she said I should report what happened to a service called Crime Check which let's you report a crime that already occurred. I would call them but I'm scared that if my parents find out I would be kicked out and that my brother might try hurting himself, if he does hurt himself I worry they would blame it on me. Another reason why I'm afraid to call them is because my parents support me financially and are putting me through school, if I call  Crime Check I'm worried they would cut me off and I wouldn't be able to afford going to school by myself. My parents also have a will and I'm set to earn a large amount of money when they die, if I report what happened I'm worried I would be cut out of it, but at this point I'm debating if I even care about being cut out of it anymore since I'm afraid for my safety. 

What happened has made my anxiety worse and I'm extremely scared my brother might try doing something worse like hurting himself or someone else. I have no one I can stay with either unless I want to go down to a domestic violence shelter and to make matters worse, I'm 20 and don't even know how to drive unless I want to take an Uber but I'm worried that if I try my parents might cancel the ride or their card. 

I have no idea what I should do and if I should call Crime Check. Should I get a plan in place in case they kick me out? Should I try telling others what's going on such as family member? I'm just worried that if I told another family member and they told my parents about it, my parents will just deny what happened and I would get kicked out. Also should I contact a domestic violence advocate or a lawyer? The only problem is I have no money for lawyer.",spazmcgee1,2019-01-29 22:06:43,0,825,17.01,30.53,41.8,1,22.3,15.88,95.39,61.58,23.52,18.06,12.61,0.12,0.12,3.88,1.33,5.45,4.36,11.88,11.27,4.85,9.21,1.7,22.3,3.76,1.58,2.42,0.97,1.09,7.15,0.61,6.55,2.18,1.21,1.33,13.58,4.12,0.12,1.58,4.61,13.94,1.09,1.94,4.36,4.73,0.85,4.61,2.06,0.36,0.85,0.73,1.33,0.36,0.97,0,0,11.39,3.76,2.18,1.94,1.82,1.94,5.94,12.24,1.45,9.7,1.33,5.09,3.39,2.18,0.48,1.94,0.48,0,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0.12,0,9.58,4,2.42,0,0,0.36,0,0,0,2.79,0,0

Open Letter To My Abuser. 

To my abuser, 

You have no idea just how much you have screwed up my life. How much pain and torture you have put me through in the relationship and out of it. How it angers me that you get to walk freely, with no consequences or punishments for all of the horrible things you have done and got away with. I have tried so hard to erase the memories of what you did to me from my mind. I have tried to forget what happened, pretend it was all just a nightmare. Yet no matter how hard I try the reality is, you abused me. 
You abused me, my body, my mind, out in public, at your house, in the safety of my own home. You stole so much from me throughout those eight months of torture. My trust in others, the way I look at life, my happiness in life. You stole the two things I have control over. The two things that no matter what storm, no matter what challenge I may face the two things I am always in control of is my body and mind. And you stole that control. You took that from me and for that I hate you. I hate the fact that you took advantage of me and abused me. You made me suffer for so long, you don’t even know how much of what you did to me in that relationship fucked me up. 
After we broke up I tried so hard to numb the pain you inflicted on me. I tried to pretend everything was okay. I thought drinking would quench the thirst I had for the pain to go away. I began recklessly living my life. Jumping into more toxic relationships and hooking up with people I didn’t even like for the hopes of being able to feel something other than the pain I was feeling, I did it in hopes of forgetting about what had happened to me. I was on a downward spiral, my world was spinning out of control and I was losing my grip. 
I bet you didn’t know I tried to kill myself. I wanted to tell you, I wanted you to know what you did to me had pushed me too far. I secretly hoped that if I killed myself and left a suicide note detailed with why I chose to end my life, you would understand that what you did was so incredibly horrible. You would feel remorse or maybe guilt. You would cry to the heavens for forgiveness for the horrible sins you committed. You would blame yourself and beg for a chance to change your actions. I wanted you to know that you were the reason I could bear no longer living. I wanted you to realize what you did.  
I had so much self blame and self hatred, I was driving myself mad. The nightmares and flashbacks of what you did to me played on repeat in my mind. That night I slit my wrists 10 times while downing a bottle of vodka. My attempt was just that an attempt, a failed attempt. I woke up the next morning feeling worse than before. I hated myself for wanting to die and hated myself even more for not being able to successfully kill myself. A few months later after the breakup having to deal with this all I had a choice to make, it was time for me to decide to either live or die. I had to choose whether I wanted to keep fighting or surrender. I knew I was spinning out of control. I knew I couldn’t let this horrible thing ruin my life. I knew I couldn’t let you ruin my life. So I made a decision. I decided I was going to continue fighting. I was going to fight this war and I had to try. I had to keep swimming. Push through the waters and make it to the other side. 
The first thing I had to do was rip the bandaids I had put over my cuts. I had hoped by placing these flimsy bandaids over these deep cut wounds, I could some how forget they were there. Just ignore the blood oozing out of the sides, the pain was still there but it was covered and not nearly as visible to the outside. I had hoped if I smiled through it I would be okay. But now I had to face what happened. I could no longer pretend the damage was not there. I had to take off the mask.
And so as the bandaids were ripped off and the blood began to pour out, all of those memories I tried so hard to forget came flooding back. Your face, the smell of your cologne, the pressure of your grip of your hand as it forcefully grabbed my wrists and threw me to the ground. I had to remember everything you did to me. I had to remember how you would throw me, hit me, slap me, push me, slashed me. How it made me feel, how at the time I felt so much fear and so much pain. I didn’t understand what I did to deserve this treatment when all I did was love you. I loved you so much you have no idea. I would have done anything for you. How I expected you not to hurt me the way you did. I would be crying in pain and you would later realise what you had done, so you would snap out of your rage and come help me up and comfort me as I cried. The bruises you left on my skin eventually faded but I still have the scars you left me from those fights, the one on my left cheek..I had to remember how you would yelled at me, shouted at me, threaten me, curse at me, call me names. All because I did something that upset you, something so small, something that shouldn’t have been taken out of hand for. You would make a big scene about the smallest things and a result in that would be you putting your rage out on me. I remembered how I would believe in your words, how scared and afraid you made me feel. How you would manipulate me, control me, my life, who I was friends with, who I talked too, I know you hated that you couldn’t be with me 24/7 because you weren’t able to control my life more than you wanted. I remember you getting jealous very easily which would lead onto you physically and verbally abusing me. You always needed to know where I was at all times. You needed to have domination and control over me to feel powerful. You would create circular, never ending conversations to confuse and exhaust me, you would hurt me with suicide, threaten it if you didn’t get your way, threaten suicide over me when you felt depressed, send pictures of a knife to your neck, making me believe that you were gonna kill yourself then you would block me on all social media. You would lack empathy for how I felt during these arguments and threats while I would feel the most empathy towards you. I would cry so hard when you would do this to me because I was so scared of losing you. After everything you did to me, I still cared for you and I shouldn’t have!. You would threaten breaking up with me whenever we had a argument to scare me, I remember you doing this to me so you could feel that you were wanted because I would be there begging him to stay. Your behaviour would be unpredictable so I wouldn’t know when you would abuse me next and that would terrify me, anything I did could trigger you into abusing me. When all of this was happening to me I took the abuse on myself by cutting because I felt like all of this was my fault. That I deserved all of this. I am not going to deny that the ways I handled this were not the great. I know I hurt you too. I know I expected a lot out of you, to be there for me when I needed you and to be a good boyfriend, but I never ever did anything like abuse you thought out that relationship. Nobody deserves the type of treatment and disrespect I got. The abuse hasn’t ended, with the posts and songs you make about me saying how much you hate me, wanting me to die, that I killed you inside. All the times you talk about me to other people saying I am a slut and a lier and all the lies you tell them saying it was all my fault and that I am the bad guy and that everything abusive that happened in our relationship was all a lie. You made me afraid to go out in public because if I ever crossed paths with you I know I will be abused all over again. It hasn’t ended, small bits of abuse still carries on today and I wish there was something I could do to stop it but I can’t. I had to remember it all and I had to deal with my monster, my demon… You. I had to choose to try to get through what you did to me. I wish the pain that you caused me could some how be bottled up or liquified so I could put it in a syeringe. I wish I could mail the bottle to you and have you open it just so all the pain that you caused could swarm over you, destroying your life like you did mine. I wish I could take that syeringe and inject it into your veins, flooding your bloodstream with all of the agonizing pain and self hatred you caused me. I wish you could live just one day with the misery I have had to deal with for the past eight months when getting abused and all the months after having to deal with it! I wish you could have to go through what I have had to. 
And yet at the same time I wish you never have to feel the pain I do. I wish that no one you love ever has to go through what I’ve had to. I wish that your younger brother, your Mother and Father, your future wife and kids, I pray they are never abused. I pray that a monster like you, a guy with the same intentions you have never inflicts that hurt on anyone you know or love. I hope I’m the only “victim” of yours. I hope you’ve never abused anyone else or never will. I hope I’m the only one who was unfortunate enough to be involved in your sick and twisted game. I hope no one else has been fucked up at the hands of you. 
You not only fucked over my body but my mind. My soul. You abused my trust in everyone. I fear every guy that I come in contact with. I’m afraid of getting too close, or being alone. You abused my self worth. I feel so ashamed and guilty for what you did to me. I blame myself every single day. I think back to every incident of abuse I encountered with you and wish I could have done more to stop you. You abused my family and friends. Those few I told, those few who know, some did not understand. They blamed me. They too were hurt. Some blamed themselves for not somehow preventing it. And some left because they couldn’t handle the pain I was going through when I would talk about my story. I lost friends because they could never imagine someone like you doing this to me. You did this to me. 
You abused me. You stole so much from me. You have been this horrible devilish monster from the depths of hell that has continued to pull me down. That took my control, that clawed at my heart and soul ripping away at all of the trust and faith I had. You have surrounded me in your burning flames and I was falling into your grip. I was falling further and further down… But now I’m slowly climbing back up. I’m pulling myself out. I’m fighting back. 
You may have done this to me. You may have abused me and hurt me in more ways than words can ever describe. But you will not win. You will not continue to taunt me. I’m fighting back. I’m getting my life back. I hate you for what you did. I will not let you win. I am going to continue fighting this war against you, even if it means I’m fighting alone. 
I know my battle is far from over. I still have a long way to go. I’m going to push through this and fight back. My wounds you caused they are still there but some day they will only be mere scars, and living with scars is much better than not living at all. You have done such a horrible thing and for that I feel so sorry for you. I only hope you can change for the better. Climb your way out of your own hell and be a better person. I’m slowly climbing out of the hell you drug me in and one day I’ll be at the top. One day I’ll be okay again. 
Sincerely,

alk60k,I still have hope,"Before my husband and I got married we had broken up for a year. (He fell for a girl at work and moved in with her while I was in France for school.) I had moved 14hrs away from my friends and family to be with him so I was left with no one. One day I ran into one of his friends and we started talking. After a few weeks and this guy calling and coming over almost every day, even asked me to take a cruise with him, we ended up having a one night fling. Soon after we stopped talking. About a week or so later my ex calls me up and one thing led to another and we had sex. Our hookups would continue another 6months until his girlfriend he was living with got fed up with his BS and dumped him. He ended up back at my place. One night his friend comes to me and begs me not to say anything about what we did. Said that it would destroy him and their friendship. I decided that I would never tell him. Fast forward 2yrs into our marriage I found out he was sleeping around with people on hookup sites. I forgave him and tried to move on. Started feeling terrible about myself and that I wasn't enough for him so I let him talk me into the swinging lifestyle.  The only rule I had was we only met others together. Never alone. Then the next year find out hes still cheating but this time he uses the ""we are swingers so it's ok"" excuse. Since that was the case I told him I didnt want to swing anymore. That I needed to be able to trust him again. He agreed, begged for forgiveness, said he would do whatever it took to fix our marriage. I knew deep down there is good in him.  I've seen him cry and saw emotions that no one ever saw in him so I believed him that he would do what was asked. That lasted maybe a month until he was back at the same game. Sneaking around when I was at work or inviting people over while he was unemployed and I was working my butt off to support 2 people and his huge car payment. Whenever I would see things around the house that were off he would try to say I was going crazy. It was all in my head and I was making stuff up. The last time I found out I was so hurt and upset that I did the one thing that I swore I would never do and would take to my grave, i told him about sleeping with his friend while he was living with another girlfriend.  I wanted to hurt him as much as he had hurt me.  All the years I had kept it down, did everything I could to be a good wife. Because why not, I loved him and why cause him that pain. His cheating was my punishment enough. It's been a year since i told him. He is still cheating but everytime I confront him he turns it all around on me and throws in my face that I slept with his friend while we were broken up.  He convinced me to get back into the swinging lifestyle again even though I told him many times I hated it. I found out he was dou g drugs and talked me into trying them with him.(i was desperate to do anything to put us back together. Now I'm slightly addicted but not as bad as I could be) He has turned my sexual kinks against me to humiliate me in private. He has recently started saying I'm spying on him, even though I'm not. And has broken 3 of my phones and my laptop because of it. One day he got violent towards me and I am still in some pain from it, that I had to pull a gun on him and leave the house. Because I dont have anyone here I had no where to go so I am back here. He has said he felt bad about that day and was sorry but has now started to spy on me. He will monitor the wifi or disconnect it when he is at work and I am home. If something is missing or goes wrong he will blame me but use words so that he can come back and say he never really blamed me. He has 2 phones and tells me one is for me and the other for his other contacts. I live in fear that when. He comes toward me to give me a hug or kiss that it's actually to get another beating. Since all this I have found out about how his childhood was, makes little orphan annie look like she lived a fairytale.) I still see the good in him. I know a lot of what he does is self destructive things to hide the pain of his family. I have tried to be a supporting wife  and take some of what he says because of what I withheld for so many years. But this past 2 weeks  I feel like I am losing my strength, my will, and my love for him. I dont know how much longer I can keep my head up and fight for me and him. I know i should have left long ago and now I'm here with a job that barely will cover life for one so I need him just as much. ( he now has a very good paying job)I am working towards a big raise so there is hope that one day I can save enough to leave and survive on my ownif I have to. I do t want it to come to that but I have a feeling deep down it will because he will one day really hurt me. I do love him. One day he will see my pain. I still have some hope left, just hope it lasts.",grapemonkey69,2019-01-30 17:27:27,1,1031,12.37,55.39,64.21,9.2,17.18,8.92,96.31,65.57,25.99,19.79,10.86,1.26,0,7.47,0.19,6.21,3.3,13.48,10.86,7.27,8.34,1.45,22.31,2.91,1.36,1.45,1.75,1.84,5.72,2.13,3.49,0.39,1.26,0.97,15.32,0.78,0.87,0.48,7.47,10.67,1.75,1.75,2.13,2.23,1.16,2.72,2.91,0.78,0.97,1.16,2.42,0.68,1.07,0.29,0.1,9.31,3.78,1.45,2.23,1.26,0.68,8.83,10.96,1.45,17.46,2.81,7.47,8.05,1.16,0.39,0.48,0.19,0,0.1,0.39,0.19,0.1,0.1,0,0,8.83,5.82,1.26,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,0.87,0.68,0
alkpb4,Not sure how to go about this,"My boyfriend, or ex boyfriend, kind of unsure at this point is 24. I am 26. We have had an extremely rocky, hard, partially crappy relationship. I’m not sure if he’s a sociopath and I’m codependent or what. But here’s some insight 

He moved in, things were perfect. Then they weren’t. He stole some small things, but I had no proof. He cheated but I had no proof. Then some things went down hill, I went to jail for the night for him, because I didn’t want him to get locked up long term (he has a record). I made a mistake with that. He started doing coke, cheating, sleeping with my friend. Then I came home one day to him gone, with my friend, and several of my things missing. I called the cops, the issues a warrant. 

Fast forward to two months later, my “friend” left him in another state, he begged me to come home. I allowed it. Because I had planned to have him set up and arrested. We spent one night together, he had lost weight, he looked so sad and broken. I allowed him to shower, eat, sleepover and then in the morning my mother called the cops. He was arrested. 


I love this man, he hurt me, he has hurt me badly. Damaged me mentally. But I love him. I want him to change. His mother said he loves me and wanted to come home. But how do I know he’ll actually change. Things may go great. They may not. I’m willing to try again. My family doesn’t want me to. My friends don’t want me to.

alns25,Last summer,"Hi.
I am miss X, age around 20s. 
Always wanted to say that, like some secret agent or something. UWU

So... I kinda have wanted to talk about this to anybody, but I havent gotten a shrink yet. Been some issues finding one, and everything has been hell the last years. 
This is about last summer. 
My sister tried killing me. 
She took a grip around my throat, and tried to choke me. 

The thing is, my sister has always hated me. Always done things to make me feel worthless, and les. She wanted my gifts. She destroyed my toys. Normal sister stuff right? When I was 7 she tried to kill me with an axe. She started up rumors about me and ensured I was bullied the whole elementary, and also during high school. She would pretend I hit her and cry, despite never having touched her. She would hit me and cry I hit her. And she called me a devil and a monster. She always hated me. 
In our teens she almost got me raped, sending me to some dude that offered her drugs in a cab. I rang on the door of the neighbour, so at least nothing came of that. I still consider her highly, even though she attacked me and bullied me all the time. Stuff she did almost drove me to suicide along with the rest of my shitty life experiences. My family, the school, nothing about it has been right. 
I accepted it quite a long time, I have always been able to survive. However, it started getting to me after I did some self help work after moving. Shit hit the fan for real when I during my sisters lies believed her as she said I should move back to the city with her. I was left with my abusive family as she went outside XXXX to study, abandoning the promise of living together. I had a real heavy depression. I still didnt go to shrink or doctors that time. Things didnt go so well. The times we meet became more and more violent. She would hit me for no reason and make me cry when talking with me alone, while pretending to be the oh so sweet and caring sister. It was her image to others. I was her stress ball for her rage. I had less and less contact, especially after I had a break down. It gave me amnesia, it wasnt just my sister triggering that, but my father as well. 
My sister have always had this contempt for me, and I knew it, so I kept a distance. She keeps blaming me for everything, despite me not being around her. She still calls me a devil, and has that evil twisted smile whenever she makes up a story for others about me. 
""Oh she is shy"" or ""Oh, she is afraid of people"" to explain away why I dont talk (because she ignores me, and doesnt listen, and if others talk to me she gets angry and demand attention).
Anyways… the last summer, after lots of issues. She also does drugs. I had a conflict with her, telling her I would be leaving. First it was a ""I will stop you"", and then as I told her about how I would tell our parents about her drug abuse, she got this stare in her eyes and said ""I will kill you"" then grabbed me by the throat and choked. Not sure how long it lasted, as I got away. Luckily as I got out of the room. This happen in a hotell, there was witnesses there. She attacked and bit me and all sorta bullshit.
And as I called for help she started screaming I was trying to kill myself. I didnt attack her, just told her to let me go, I was not gonna stay there with her. I couldnt stop crying as she had been extremely mean the whole night (it was our first time on the city for almost a year apart as I have come to be afraid of her after the last time she started to attack me for no reason). 
The situation was luckily broken up by other guests at the hotell. There is probably no note in the news either of my country, as it was probably paid away or some shit. I cried all the night to staff, I didnt talk about what she had done, but I told her how mean she was. After, my eyes became blood red, almost completely red. I have had issues, been really broken, and I still get thinking about it. I was broken all up to Christmas. She did not apolegize either, except in front of our mother. Beside that she called me a lier and such. 
I told our parents about her drug abuse on a later date. 
... as I started feeling better, it was just one week of peace this december, and then mom died. 
I have heavy conflicts within myself. I am still to broken to deal with my sister, but my mom wanted us to be friends. Yet she ignores me completely. Of course I blocked her before the funeral, but thats past. She ignores me and doesnt aknowledge me in conversations, except if there is anyone else talking to me. And she will have that look of ""Dont talk to her"" while acting like its ""fine"". I really dont want contact. She has to mature on her own, I must live for my own sake. 
I have been with an emergency shrink a while, its just temporary, so I dont know how it will work out mentally. 
I feel like I should honor my mothers wishes, but it doesnt seem like she wanna try at all. 
I am afraid. I feel like she is going to kill me. 
She is gonna find the time. I dont feel safe at all. 
I am afraid. I dont openly admit it even to the emergency shrink.
Often I show a stone face, but I am in true turmoil. I am afraid.
How am I suppose to deal with this? I should keep away until she figures out her own issues. I feel nauseous of the though of being close to someone who wants me to die. Its horrible. 
I cant forget it. I though I knew, like before winter I was like ""I am gonna live for myself"" that was when I finally like was able to start doing stuff again, but then... and now I feel unsure again. 

Anyone else been through anything similar? Its probably not normal having a sister try to kill you and hating you so intens for no reason. I was early taller than my sister, and I was blond and had blue eyes. She cut my hair of when I was a kid because she was jealous of me. She always say I am such a horrible person. 
I just dont know how to deal with her in my current state. 
I dont think I should keep in contact any more. She never contacted me anyways. I was always the one doing the calling.

I dont know what to do :(",Silentico,2019-01-31 01:20:57,0,1210,18.72,31.89,69.93,1,12.22,9.92,95.45,63.14,23.55,18.68,11.9,0.58,0.33,5.87,0,4.88,4.38,13.47,10.17,7.02,7.77,2.73,20.83,5.54,3.31,1.32,0.5,1.98,6.28,1.32,4.96,0.91,2.4,0.83,13.22,1.57,0.66,7.02,0.08,14.13,2.81,1.32,1.74,3.22,2.31,3.8,2.56,0.83,0.58,0.99,2.07,0.83,0.99,0.08,0.08,6.03,2.31,1.24,1.65,0.83,0.33,7.93,9.26,1.24,13.22,1.4,4.63,7.27,0.83,0.5,0.41,0.08,0.33,0.83,1.65,0.41,0.5,0,0.41,0.17,14.88,8.43,4.71,0,0,0.25,0,0,1.16,0,0.33,0

Most importantly always portray a happy, perfect family. As I grew older I realized as silly as this may sound that I have perhaps been greatly physically abused by my alcoholic father. Who I dearly love so much no matter how abused I was. But after an ugly break up with this guy, I started to question if I ever was really abused. This guy told me that everyone had problems and it wasn’t a big deal. He said he knew people who had it way worse. This is when I realized my mother was right, I will never tell another guy the way I was treated growing up. It’s nearly 5am I cant sleep and I can’t stop crying. I’m so confused! I was born in Mexico and as far back as I can remember my dad always had a drinking problem. He would come home at 5am In the morning extremely intoxicated, would wake my mother up to cook him something to eat. While she cooked he verbally abused her following with physical abuse. I recall one night in particular, he was so mad he throw a steaming hot pan to hit her but it hit me instead. I was only 3 years old. I don’t know how I recall all of this but i do. Another vivid story before we moved to the United States and the abuse continued was an evening where my father was Incredibly intoxicated. My mother begged him not to take me with him to the city but he was a man and was not going to listen to no women. After all she is beneath him! He picks me up and takes me in his truck, he speeds back and forth, next thing I know we completely fip in his truck. We could have both died that night. Shortly after my sister was born and we moved to the United States. My poor mother was beaten so badly so many nights. We once where forced to sleep outside of thier apartment while my mother was covered in blood. She hadn’t washed the covers I vomited on the previous night because i was sick. My mother’s knee hurts pretty often my father was beating her and she hit her knee on the chimney bricks. The abuse was constant, he had no sympathy. Years later my mother was pregnant again, this night he placed his arm over her 8 month belly. She told him it was very uncomfortable, his response was to beat her until her arms, legs and face were purple. My mother started working when I was in elementary school, leaving me to take care of the kids. I was like their mother, changed their dippers, feed them and put them to sleep. There was always verbal abuse when my dad was drunk, I always was belittled and told I was stupid, not worth anything and never amount to anything. When I became a preteen the physical abuse started more intensely then before. I was so depressed all I wanted to do was sleep so I wasn’t abused or wouldn’t think about it. I was constantly dragged from my hair to my bedroom because he simply didn’t want to see me in the living room. Then the door knob would be torn off because he wanted to redrag me out of my room. One night before my 15th birthday, I was woken up with him punching my face. By now I was so used to the constant beatings and verbal abuse. I woke up the next day with a busted lip and half of my face completely purple. Sometime I get so angry at my mother thinking about it. She asked me that morning who had done that to me? My father of course, she called him yelling at him for beating me so badly. That was the only time I felt like my father felt remorse, he gave me $100. I always wonder however, why my mother didn’t try to stop him from hurting me but I guess she couldn’t if she was receiving the same treatment,",Itallgetsbetter,2019-01-31 05:24:35,2,750,17.32,46.27,75.12,1,15.62,12.67,94,59.07,23.07,18.93,11.6,0.8,0,6,0.53,4.13,4.27,10.93,9.6,6.53,7.6,2.53,18.4,5.07,2.93,1.6,0.93,1.6,6,1.07,4.8,0.4,2.4,0.67,15.2,3.2,0.8,4.13,5.6,12.93,2.13,1.47,2.13,2.8,2.8,2.8,1.73,0.53,0.53,0.67,4.53,2.13,1.47,0.13,0.93,5.6,1.73,0.53,2,0.8,0.8,11.73,5.07,0.8,16.67,1.6,5.47,9.87,0.53,0.93,1.07,0.27,0,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.93,5.73,2.93,0,0,0.13,0.27,0,0,1.73,0,0.13

alvow0,"My Mom Abuses and Controls Me, I Don't Know What To Do, I Just Want To Be Free and Happy","I am so sorry. I don't know if I should even post this. Today has been a really bad day and I can't go on much more with this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my 20s, female, I'm an adult but feel like a helpless child. I graduated college years ago but have not had a job in 2 years because my mother is very emotionally abusive and controlling. She locked me out of my bank account taking ownership over it. It is all the money I saved up from gift money from relatives, and when I did have a job and earned income. I can't even try to talk to the bank about it because I fear what I'll face from my mother while I still live with her. She took my car from me. She does not let me get a new job because she does not want me leaving but she verbally abuses me every day about how I'm a useless, worthless, pathetic, jobless loser, but she forbids me from applying to jobs online or leaving the house. I can't win.

She always caters to my sister that she actually loves. She is equally abusive to me. The apple did not fall far from the tree with this one. She can do no wrong and is the perfect child to my mom. My mom always favored her. In school, she was allowed to do whatever she wanted, join clubs and sports, hang out with friends, was given money to spend on game consoles, makeup, fashion, etc anything she wanted. Yet I was banned from doing any of that. I don't have any happy childhood memories.

She bans me from eating the ""good"" food in the house because it is for my precious sister. So I have to scavenge through old food and she insults me for being a pig eating anything. She taunts that if I want something to eat then I should buy it myself but wait I don't have money to spend or a car to get to the store haha. She throws it in my face that I should be grateful for how she allows me to live on her dime because she buys the food and it gives her permission to treat me however she wants and if she does not want me to eat then she has a right to dictate that too.

She uses me as a scapegoat for any anger she feels. Without prompting she will call me an ungrateful selfish bitch if she is in a bad mood and then continue with insults from there when I'm just existing. 

I feel so guilty for everything because I hate feeling hated. I am so depressed and I truly believe everything is my fault because I wasn't good enough, but logically I know I am the way I am is because of my mom's treatment since I was a little girl. I want to fix our relationship because I hate the idea of not having a mother. I see how close other people are with their moms and I cry because I want that. Talking to my mom about how I feel is useless, already tried. She just verbally abuses me more . She does not see how her behavior is wrong because nothing she does to me is wrong in her own eyes. I just think the best thing for us is separation. Maybe one day she will realize what she has done if I make a life for myself and she's not included.

I am afraid of talking to my dad about it. He does love me, I just know that he's disappointed in me. To him I'm just a jobless adult living at home for 2 years. He is always working so he does not know what actually happens. I don't know if he'll believe me, scoff and tell me to just get over it, or talk to my mom about it which will then start a fight with me.

I feel worthless, I'm not qualified for jobs with my degree anymore because I don't have experience and it is not like I can explain my abuse, depression, and 2 year gap of no job to any hiring employer. I lost all my friends because I was not allowed to see or talk to them anymore. And now I am just too ashamed to even reach out to my old friends to open up to them about what happened to me because I don't want to be judged. It's not like I can live at any of their places while I find my footing. I see it all the time that no one believes victims and that victims are blamed, and they were not exactly there for me when I did try to open up to them when we were friends.

I just wish I could pack up all my stuff and move out but I don't have money to pay for rent, bills, or a job to even support myself, and I wouldn't be able to even take my stuff with me because I lack a car to use. Yet, I feel so pathetic because I am afraid to leave even though I am so desperate for it. I have no idea what the real world is like because my mother's control is all I've ever known. I don't even know how to socialize anymore because she has been the only person I could talk to.

Or even a friend to talk to?",teacat3,2019-01-31 15:32:21,3,949,13.4,15.83,58.82,1.54,18.61,12.64,95.36,64.38,23.29,18.44,12.86,0.32,0,4.64,0.63,4.85,3.9,12.64,10.85,6.22,9.06,3.58,20.02,2.42,0.95,1.9,0.63,1.69,6.74,1.79,4.85,0.63,1.58,1.48,10.96,1.58,0.53,5.69,0.74,15.91,2.74,3.58,2.53,2.53,1.69,4.74,1.37,0.53,0,0.74,1.79,0.32,0.53,0,0.74,7.69,1.79,1.05,3.48,1.26,0.74,2.95,16.12,1.16,9.17,1.26,3.58,4.21,2.21,0.32,0.42,2.11,0,0,0.21,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,12.33,5.06,3.06,0,0.42,0.21,0,0,0.21,2.95,0,0.42
alvwys,Help me understand this behaviour,"Hello,    


I'm not sure if this is the right sub for such a post, please point me to another if it isn't. I'd like to understand and possibly help the behaviour of my father.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24M, and living like this for so long has definitely had devastating effects on me, but let's not talk about that now.  I'll try to explain the patterns and if someone can help with advice or a possible diagnose I'd be very thankful.  At least I'm old enough to leave and live on my own and I should've already done it long ago.  

  
So, my father has been an alcocholic for as far as I can remember, but I'm don't think that alone can lead to such behaviour.  Years ago he used to drink harder stuff, but after he had a pancreatic operation, he's been drinking just wine most of the time. I guess around at least 1, probably 2 liters per day. Consuming it in small amounts during the entire day, while driving, while working, at home.  

&amp;#x200B;

He has never acknowledged that he has a problem, even though we've tolerated it and lived like this for more than a decade. He is the kind of person that would never be satisfied with anything done by others. Not just that, he'd get unimaginably irritated by even the slightest of things. It's hard to describe it, but no matter what you do it's never the right thing.  

As an example, it applies to literally anything, but let's say that he's behaving like a relatively normal person for once, you're making a salad and you put the ingredients in a different order than he would. Of course, there is no right order, because the right way is always different for him. That may cause his entire behaviour to snap to this other person. Best case scenario in this case, he'd not talk to anyone for the rest of the evening, not eat with us and look everyone with an expression full of hatred.  

&amp;#x200B;

He never talks about what he thinks is wrong and never attempts to resolve a problem like a normal human being. He expects that everyone should already know why he's displeased and he's looking at his own family with hatred like we're his mortal enemy. He always looks down on everyone, something that I've inherited, but thankfully I've started giving the benefit of the doubt to people. He's constantly slamming doors, occasionally breaking dishes, throwing away food just after it's been prepared, breaking electronic devices.  Sometimes doesn't eat on the same table or speak to us for months, because ... There is no good reason, but supposedly because he has something against my mother. Back when me and my brother were smaller, we'd never both be on good terms with him. It always felt like he preferred one and hated the other. This has switched between us several times.  

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is the most selfless person I know. She's never done anything for herself, barely sees her friends, the few that are left after my father has pushed away any family friends that they might have had when they were young. Works a full dayjob and when not that always does things around the appartment. She hardly ever confronts him about anything, but the few times she's done, It's never ended with anything good. She should've left him years ago, but she never did.  

  
Living like this I've learned to be obidient, anxcious, antisocial, afraid, silent - because not once have I spoken my opinion it ended well - I've been struggling with communicating like a normal person for the better part of my life.   

  
He's never physically abused us, but he's been controlling and unpredictable enough that I've been afraid not so much for myself, but for my mother and my little brother. I can't exclude the possibility that he could just snap one day and do the unthinkable. It's actually one of the reasons I'm still living with my family. I don't want to leave them alone with him.",anothdayinparadise42,2019-01-31 16:08:39,5,686,18.45,52.92,47.03,19.26,18.54,16.91,92.13,61.66,21.28,12.97,5.39,1.31,0.44,5.39,0.44,8.31,5.69,12.83,12.83,7.14,7,3.79,19.53,5.54,4.08,0.87,1.02,2.33,4.81,2.19,2.62,0.73,0.87,0.44,13.56,1.6,0.29,1.46,5.1,18.22,2.48,1.9,2.19,4.81,3.21,5.39,1.6,0.58,0.58,0.44,2.62,0,1.31,0,1.31,6.56,3.06,1.02,1.75,1.02,0.73,5.25,12.83,0.73,14.87,1.46,5.25,7.87,0.87,1.02,0.73,0.15,0,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0.15,0,20.26,5.54,5.98,0,1.17,0,0,0.29,0,6.12,0,1.17
alw6lx,Trama from witnessing abuse,"I was not abused myself. But during my teens I secondhand witnessed a lot of emotionally abuse: friends who were in emotionally abusive romantic relationships, friends who had emotionally abusive families (also witnessing the emotional scars my dad had left from growing up in an abusive home), friends who were emotionally abusive to other friends, coworkers who were abusive to other coworkers. And then there's the abuse that affected me the most: my sister's (thankfully now ex) superficially charming husband being incredibly manipulative and emotionally abusive towards her.
I never realized what an effect these experiences had on me until recent therapy has brought them up. I have all this shame and guilt because I wasn't able to do anything about all the abuse I witnessed. I was a kid and I didn't even realize until later what was going on was emotional abuse. And I feel deep guilt because I'm not the actual victim of the abuse and yet I feel trama. I feel terrible as I feel like my pain undermines the pain that the actual victims of abuse feel. My therapist tells me that it's ok to feel this pain, but I still can't let go of my guilt and shame. But the biggest issue I have is trust. I feel like I can't trust anyone outside of my immediate family and a few friends. I'm wary of anyone new I meet because I never know if they could secretly be a manipulative abuser in disguise. I've witnessed so many unsuspecting people be abused by people who on the surface seem very normal and kind, and I'm deathly worried that it will happen to me.

alxhrf,"Extremely Controlling Mother, Please Help!","Thank you for reading, and I will try to keep this simple...

Ok, my mom has beaten me nearly to death like so many times ever since she divorced and her life flipped upside down. She began to take out her anger on us (she was still very strict before) but it only got worse. As a kid, watching television, playing video games, and using the computer we're absolutely forbidden. We spent all our (brother and sister) time locked in the dark frigid basement dreaming about what it would be like to live more normal lives like the kids at school who excluded us out of everything because we weren't normal. As a kid punishments would come by being whipped for up to 20 minutes with a hangar, usually several because they would break after a few hard smacks, no food, no water, no washroom - for days if on Easter or Christmas break, splashing boiling or ice cold water at us, the steel edge belt, several hour long lectures where I have actually passed out after standing up for 11 hours straight and not having eaten anything or sleeping the day before. We would also be forced to take cold showers in the middle of the winter with the windows open, like water boarding basically or be beaten with a broom up to a hundred times just for forgetting or missing a speck on wall. Then we have to reclean it for up to an hour as she screams and yells at us and throws or kicks the back of our heads into the wall and forces us to clean the blood off of the wall and floor etc. 

Then one day there was a turning point, our elementary principal got fed up with all the scars on our body, withdrawal from school, especially the large slash only face that made me look like scarface. She called CPS and they visited us 8 times in 10 months. It was a joke, the dates that they visited we're all pretty discussed, informed, and my mother even bought cinnamon rolls and soft drinks and prepared them for the visitors after making me and my brother sparkle down the house for hours. She made sure to reheat those treats until the icing was melting and those retards came over with their stupid concerned faces on. She beat up my brother and forced him to tell them that all the scars on myself were from fights with him or other kids. Anyway, they never show up again and I am viscously strangled, chocked, and was even thrown onto the pavement once in the basement where my 200 pound brother jumped in the air and slammed my head right into the floor leaving me with a large slash on my scalp, and surprisingly no brain - I think. One time was so bad that I knew I was going to die or something, after being punched in the face around 50 times and suffocated until I couldn't think straight or see anything, I was in so much pain that I actually ignored how shy I am of a person and pushed my mother against the wall and ran out of the house. I could barely grip the handle because my hands were covered in blood from before the punching ensued since she slashed my chest earlier, either way I was able to out run her obese self simply by running through the halls by memorization of the house interior (couldn't open my eyes, way too bruised). I took off for the school but this was on a weekend, I never knew any other place to go to except there ( I was 14 ) - and these beatings happened on nearly a daily basis though I was always singled out and was basically the scapegoat of all the family problems.


After all these incidents it has become insanely clear that she hates us, she told us that she wants us to die and regretted having us. As she the years have passed she has become more aware that she has no education, no professional job, absolutely no savings, no house, zero credit, no spouse (no sh##), no inheritance, she would be denied a mortgage at every turn, though she never tries to get one since she wouldn't have the means to pay for one anyway. 

She changed her mind about us getting the hell out of her life, and has now decided that we are absolutely forbidden from talking to anyone - especially females - and that when we become legally adults we will be forced to stay with her for the rest of our lives, no marriage, no friends, we will have to get professional careers however, but no contact with any coworkers, oh yeah and we will have to buy her a large house so she can compare with some unknown relatives or friend + whatever's cars she wants to own or lease all straight out of our pockets. She owns 5 phones and one laptop which my brother uses for his University research. 

Normally this wouldn't concern me but my brother graduated high school last year with a 97% average and almost 20k in scholarships on top of being valedictorian.

alxo7k,Was this sexual abuse? Please help.,"Just need to know for sure. Opinions. I keep not being sure because...well I'll explain after.

Throwaway account because I'm really detailed here and I'm fucking embarassed and ashamed.

When I was 6-7, my grandmother used to help me masturbate. She never touched me, I touched myself. But she watched, and she would go through extremely kinky/sexual roleplays with me verbally until I had ""a really good feeling"", which of course I didn't understand. But I liked doing it. But...I was a child. It doesn't matter that I liked it, right? Or is that normal?

I recently found film of one of the times. My dad filmed it, said he thought it was ""cute,"" (on the film, he was explaining why he was trying to film) and my grandma said ""We need privacy, come on!"" like...jokingly. Like it was funny or normal. I had...such a breakdown upon seeing this that I honestly can't explain. I was, up until that point, only about 97% sure it happened at all. There was still that chance I imagined it.

But I remembered when I saw it. We would go behind the chair downstairs and do that, and I even asked my dad why it felt good and he said ""haha uhh I don't know"" and brushed it off. 

I also believe my grandfather abused me. I have years of missing memories of afternoons spent alone with him after school. In fact, I hardly have any memories at all before the age of 10. He has stared at me sexually since before I was even going though puberty, has groped my breasts, all to the point I'm still too scared to be around him or walk around the house in anything but extremely baggy clothes that hide my body, and turn my back to him if he sees me. 

This has all beyond fucked me up. I continued to be sexual throughout my entire childhood, was writing sex and rape and incest stories at 7 or 8, and showed every mental symptom of childhood sexual abuse and still continue to. They actually got worse as time went on, the groping happened during my teenage years and there was other physical/emotional abuse from my family.

Anyway. Was it sexual abuse, what happened with my grandmother? It destroys me that every one would watch me orgasm, including my pervert of a grandfather. I know it happened. It wasn't even secretive or anything. And after it was normal, I would act out my kinks with my barbie dolls during play time and shit. I would try to make out with my dad. 

Was I just a fucking disgustingly sexual child? Can children be born that way? Just...gross? Or??? I'm so fucking lost. I'm so lost. I'm. So. Fucking.

alxv52,I think I am being abused,"Hello. My name is Matthew and I am 12. I think I am being abused. I suffer from misaphonia and I stutter sometimes, so I am usually pretty angry. My father has been hitting me for years now and has only not done it as much now because I started hitting him back and I threatened to tell cps. I fucking hate my parents and I want to beat the shit out of them and I know I can because my dad is fat as fuck. I don't even like thinking of him as my father and when referring to him I usually just call him ""him"". I have had bruises on my legs and arms. My mother is a bitch because she is always forcing me to go to bullshit fucking therapists without telling me. When I tell the therapist that I get abused, the therapist will ask my mom ""Are you aware of this"", and she just fucking says that I'm exaggerating and that they will only slap me a little bit.  I don't have a bed anymore. I just sleep on the couch in the living room. I used to have a bed, but it was too small for me and it broke. Whenever I told the therapist that I don't have a room, my mom would interrupt me and say ""You can choose a new bed if you want"" which is a fucking lie. My dad also breaks all of my shit. I have Razer headphones that I got a few years ago and he has thrown them on the floor while hitting me, so they feel flimsy as fuck now. I also used to have a laptop but my brother broke it while he was kicking me. I am using my mom's laptop, which I shouldn't be on, to type this. My family is not at all poor, but they literally won't buy me anything and they get my fucking brother whatever he wants because he is such a fucking angel. My brother will come down to the living room at 1:00 in the morning and just start eating fucking chips and shit. I have misaphonia so the crunching annoys the shit out of me, so I start yelling at him to get the fuck out. Then that wakes up my parents and now everythings my fault even though he is doing it on purpose to annoy me. He is 15. I also know that my parents talk about me all the fucking time because when I go to my grandparents house for a holiday or something, I go upstairs away from everyone so I don't have to hear them eating and when I come down to use the bathroom everyone scolds me like I'm a fucking criminal. At home to avoid having to hear people eating, I have to wait in the bathroom doing fucking nothing. I just sit on the toilet and play with scissors or something. I literally spend hours every day in a bathroom. Im going to fucking go insane from sitting on a toilet in a small white room. I have cut myself on purpose with a boxcutter once. I fucking hate my life. What should I do. I want to call cps but I don't know what it is, but there is something holding me back from doing it. I could keep typing, but I should get off my moms laptop before she catches me.",seallover419,2019-01-31 19:39:08,4,583,15.79,12.18,87.11,1,17.15,13.89,94.17,63.81,24.19,19.21,14.92,0,0.51,2.57,1.2,4.97,5.49,11.49,10.63,6,9.26,1.89,20.75,4.46,1.2,1.72,0.86,1.2,7.03,0.34,6.69,0.34,5.32,0.51,10.46,2.92,0,1.37,3.43,10.29,1.72,1.89,1.72,1.89,1.54,2.23,1.37,0.17,1.03,0.17,5.66,1.37,1.37,2.57,0.69,4.46,1.37,0.51,1.54,0.86,0.51,2.4,14.92,1.2,13.21,1.37,6.52,5.66,0.69,1.03,2.4,0.51,0.17,0,3.6,3.6,0,0,0,0,10.98,5.66,2.4,0.17,0,0,0,0,1.03,1.72,0,0

am8v84,Am I over reacting?,"This happened in the spring of last year and it was hard to deal with for numerous reasons (I’ll explain) but I thought I had dealt with it and now I just don’t know. Not sure if this is even the right place to share this.

When I returned to work from Maternity leave last February, there was a new employee that had started when I was off work. She seemed friendly, I had no issues with her, really, other than she was really *really* slow at catching on to basic things. But that really wasn’t uncommon at my job. 

Anyway, she really seemed to latch on to me, for whatever reason. I’m not the most overly friendly person, and numerous people even commented on how attached she seemed to me. Things got more and more weird. She would walk around asking where I am to ask me a question...that she could have literally asked anyone. 

We had non-violent crisis intervention training together once and were partnered up. It’s a hands-on training, but whatever. We have to do it once a year. Anyway, on our break, the giant room was empty and everyone had gone out to smoke except her and I. I was leaning against the counter and she came and stood next to me. And her body from her knees to her shoulders were right against me. It was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable. Every time I shifted away, she shifted with me.

She found me once helping another co-worker and ask to speak to me privately. Co-worker and I looked at each other weird, and I told her that whatever she had to speak to me about could be said there. Turns out she wanted to ask me if I could make her a scarf (I crochet) Weird how she asked, but again, whatever. I pulled up some pics on my phone and she came over to look...except she ended up pressing her breasts against my back and laid her chin on my shoulder in order to look at my phone...that I was holding way out towards her. That was the worst thing that happened. 

And to be honest, as uncomfortable and weird as that was, that wasn’t what causes my anxiety to spike when I think about the whole situation.

I emailed my supervisor about it asking for help in how to handle the situation because I wasn’t comfortable being around her anymore and his response? “Did you tell her that it bothered you? How will she know you’re uncomfortable if you don’t tell her?” 

I contacted my union rep and explained the situation and my supervisors response and what did *he* say? “Well talk to her then and tell her you have a large personal space.” 

So I contacted a higher up union rep and filed a formal complaint against my supervisor AND her. It turned into a whole ordeal about why I didn’t just talk to her and *he* thought it was dealt with and “why didn’t you tell me it was continuing”

My reasoning was...if I had gone to him in the first place and stated that one of my MALE co-workers had pressed themselves against me and was always trying to find me alone...would he have brushed me off? I highly doubt it, right?! I sat in a meeting with my union rep, supervisor and head of HR and cried because they were blaming me for making this whole situation a bigger deal than it should have been.

I no longer work at this place (thank fuck) but I was out today and happened to see this supervisor. He didn’t see me. But I instantly had a mini panic attack and I was filled with rage and pain and wanted to cry. 

Am I over reacting to all of this? As unprofessional and just weird as the situation with this girl was, it’s how my supervisor handled it that really has me upset about what happened. 

I don’t even know what I’m looking for in sharing this...validation maybe? Just to vent and get it off my chest? I don’t know...I just know I’m still so angry about it :(

am9owj,Is is abuse??,"I'm young, Jr. High age, but I think I've been abused, and I have no idea what to do.
My mother *sometimes* emotionally abuses me, like yelling at me and calling me disgusting, wrong, and telling me that some of the things I like/am is wrong and I shouldnt do it/like it. 
For example, I'm trans, ftm, and every time I bring it up, or even living masculine things, she always says something like ""you'll never be that way, that's wrong, you need to quit, its just a phase"" etc. 

I accept the fact that it MAY BE a phase, but being trans now makes me happy, makes me feel good about myself, which i never do. 

Is it abuse??


Other than that, i have an older step brother. Since my mom is married to his dad ((my step dad)) my step brother, who I'll call john, comes over every other weekend since he lives with his birth mom. It Started two years ago. He since he stays in my room because it's the biggest room in the house. But when I'm laying down to sleep, or take a nap, and I'm almost asleep, he'll lay behind me, spooning me. He'll either grind on me, make me jerk him off, or just generally do shit to me while I'm ""asleep"",, in reality I'm just horrified and anxious out of my mind. He's only two years older than me, but he's a lot bigger and stronger, and even hits me sometimes.

But I've never said no, because I never had tbe option to. I've tried to make him stop though. I've slept in different rooms of the house, wrapped myself up in blankets, etc. 

Is it abuse?

She terrified of being taken away, losing her brother, losing her mother, losing her friends at school, and put into a home of some strangers who could potentially abuse her personally.

amcqg5,"My friend [F 22] is in an abusive relationship, what am I supposed to do ?","It’s long, beware, but all details are necessary 

The guy [M 24] raised so many red flags, I’m actually glad they don’t live together yet :

* She is Jewish, and he made a cheap joke at her expense once, dropping a penny on the floor and saying “Well why don’t you pick it up, since you Jews like money so much ?”. It never happened again, but she and I agree it was over the top
* He’s a kinda “do as I say, not as I do” guy. He would berate her for being annoying when she wants attention, but then he nags her when he absolutely want to go out and she doesn’t. If she says anything (which she doesn’t anymore”, then she’s the joy killer
* He slept with other girls while they were on break (which could or could not be an offense by different standards), but then is always on her back when guys hit on her at her work. She kindly rejects them, but then he gets angry nevertheless. She can never win
* During this same break, he was all kind and sorrowful, telling her how sorry he was, how he’ll try to change and how he hates himself over what he did. Then left her in the middle of a town she doesn’t when they argued THE DAY THEY GOT BACK TOGETHER
* He ALWAYS compares her to his ex, in some kind or another. He told his friends she gave better blowjobs than his ex, that she should grow a spine more like his ex, that they never had sex on furniture like they did with his ex DUDE STOP
* He went physical on her, once. He pushed her down the couch. It wasn’t anything serious, but she really felt unsafe and I was ready to help her pick up her things (which she declined)
* Whenever she brings up an issue, whatever it is, he gets super mad and accuses her of looking for troubles on purpose. Not too long ago, he snapped at her because she dared *say she needed a new pair of stockings when they were making out*. His outburst made my friend cry, and when she asked for a hug he said, and I quote “No, you deserved it !”
* He’s never there for her, emotionally. She called me yesterday with fucking suicidal thoughts, and told me that when she tried to tell him about it, he just got mad and left because he found her annoying

At this moment, I did something I know I shouldn’t have done now : I sent him a message, asking him why he was seemingly making her miserable on purpose. The conversation went like this :

Me : You really are a moron, aren’t you ? Do you know what’s happening right now ?

Him : Do you ? Do you know the entirety of the story ?

Me : I’m at the phone with her right now

Him : You don’t know anything, and it’s none of your business. Stop talking to me, go back to your life and let us live ours

Me : You’re not giving me orders. I know Clara can feel overwhelmed easily but if you don’t have enough empathy to handle this, please don’t make her more miserable

Him : Shut the fuck up. Isn’t *that* an order ?

Me : Pathetic

He then proceeded to message her, telling her she’d “better not still be at his place when he comes back”, because you just don’t fuck with a guy who comes up with threats like this, no matter how misleading they are.

Her parents were teaching her about sexual education so she had lots of learning materials, she would lock me in her room with her and show me the books and things, but she would also attempt to “have sex” with me, essentially scissoring pretending she had a penis. She would insert objects into me. She would analyze and touch my breasts (non existent breasts seeing as I was only 7). Sometimes she would it her bras on me and stuff them with tissue. Sometimes she would try acting out different sexual acts she had seen somewhere. I hated going there and I can’t erase the feeling of dread  regarding her.

amj4cs,I'm in Europe and I suspect abuse in America. What can I do?,"I met a girl from America on discord a week or so ago, we were having nice conversations and all, until she suddenly messaged me she was in 'deep shit' I asked what was wrong, and she told me it was because she ""Can't vacuum correctly,"" She apparently had all her electronics privileges taken away, and was sneaking in the conversation we were having. When I asked what exactly she did wrong, she told me she didn't know, but that he also ""made me get on my hands and knees and sweep with a tiny childs broom for the whole upstairs"" Adding that it was mostly carpet. When I asked if he normally punished her like this she told me he normally just beat her up. I freaked out slightly, and asked if she could maybe call cps or the police, since beating a child is not okay, she told me ""It's fine, I'm used to it."" She swore to me she wasn't being abused, after telling me she was fine for a few times, but I still didn't really believe her. I decided to let it go, and just chat about nicer things for a bit. Her punishment lasted ""till I can show respect"" but she gave me the home telephone number, for if I wanted to hear her voice. Calling rates being €1,25 per minute, I nicely asked if I could save it, for if it ever became necessary for something, she agreed, and gave me her last name, so I could save her in my contacts. After she suddenly stopped texting, I assumed her dad come home, since she told me she'd leave when he came. Now I hadn't heard from her a few days, and suddenly got a message, telling me it was her dad, that her privileges were taken away, and politely asking me never to contact her again (I should add that when he went into discord he probably saw an erotic roleplay going on.) Her discord profile picture is default now, and we're no longer friends, or in any mutual servers.

amjlvq,My boyfriend beat his dog,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years now. He’s 20 and I’m 19. I’m usually at my parents house because my school and work is closer to it but I decided to spend the night at his place last night. 

Sometimes my boyfriend pushes his dog lightly and yells at it, but that’s all I’ve ever seen him do until last night. I was really tired last night and I was half awake. I heard him get out of bed when his dog started barking in another room. Only a few seconds after he got up, I heard his dog crying and it’s body hitting against something. I didn’t get out of bed because I wasn’t really sure what was happening at first and i know this sounds pathetic but I was afraid of him because sometimes he gets physical when he’s angry. He’s never hurt me but he had pushed me and yelled at me. My heart beat so fast and I pretended to be asleep. I was afraid that if I asked him what he did or if I checked out the dog then he would hurt me or threaten me not to tell anyone. I felt guilty and I also felt like a coward. I used to work at a zoo and I work a lot with animals so it just makes me feel sick that I didn’t do anything to stop him. 

When he came back in the room he laid next to me and put his arm around me. My entire body shivered. I hoped I was hearing things or it was a dream that he beat his dog. 

When I woke up my boyfriend was asleep. I went to the kitchen to get some water and my heart was beating so fast. I wanted to check the dogs room to see if it was ok but I was also afraid to see. 

I went in and his dog was laying there in its cage. I opened it and it’s nose and mouth was covered in blood. It’s legs were in a weird position. They might’ve been broken. I felt dizzy. I was afraid to confront my boyfriend about it because I never thought he’d do this. I wasn’t sure whether to talk to him first or call animal control. I was getting ready to go home and then he walked in. 

He asked me where I was going. All I could do was tell him I had to go. He grabbed my arm and told me to talk to him. I told him I knew what he did, and before he could say anything more or stop me I pulled my arm away and walked out. I heard him yelling at me. I called animal control and they’re looking into it now.",athenaxox19,2019-02-02 15:09:55,1,476,6.83,22.48,89,2.83,14,10.08,94.96,62.61,27.31,21.64,14.08,0,0,7.35,0.21,5.67,2.31,11.13,10.71,5.04,10.71,1.47,22.48,4.2,1.05,1.89,1.26,1.68,4.62,1.05,3.57,1.26,1.26,0.84,12.61,0.21,1.05,0,8.4,13.03,1.89,1.68,1.68,3.99,1.68,4.62,4.41,0.84,1.89,1.47,3.99,2.73,0.84,0,0.42,6.51,1.47,1.68,2.31,1.26,0.63,11.76,8.61,0.63,16.81,2.94,6.93,7.56,0.84,0.21,1.68,0.21,0,0,0.21,0,0,0.21,0,0,11.13,6.93,0.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.57,0,0
amkciw,Is my daughter in a bad relationship?,"Hello community! 

&amp;#x200B;

So I do not know exactly how to start but I need your advice. My daughter has been dating her boyfriend for 5 years now. They started when they were in middle school. He had some ADHD issues and showed a little temper but nothing really bad. After graduating he changed and I love him like a son so it is really hard to write this. He started talking down to her. He never seems to recognize when he is in the wrong. And I have to admit sometimes I think he grabs her when he is angry and does not understand how much it can hurt her. It's not like he is hitting her or beating her up but I am starting to think it's emotional abuse and I worry that it could turn to physical. 

&amp;#x200B;

He has called her names, used profanity and told her to F off, to shut the F up, and how sick he is of her at times. He always blames her no matter what. And to punish her he threatens to go hang with his friends (why that is a threat I do not know). The one thing I never cared for him about was he does not let her have friends of her own.  He is very jealous and I know that is not a good thing but he works on it. But lately he barely sees her and when he does he gets so angry. He has no problem telling me off either. Last month he saw her maybe 3 days of the whole month. He is not out hanging with friends, he is home locked in his room playing video games.  Last month I thought she might be pregnant. when I told him he came back with ""if she is, it's not mine"". Completely floored me. I would never thought he would have said that. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband never talks to me like that. We would have to have a major fight for him to even come close. Honestly I want to tell her to leave him but I also want to stay out of her business. Maybe he just needs to grow up and then come back if it's meant to be. Be honest here with me.

amkw7v,I got triggered over a message,"My ex got some random person to message me (assuming it was there friend but it was a new account so it could've been them?) to see I wanted to talk our differences out but wanted someone else to ask because they didn't want to just straight up message me, I instantly deleted the message and blocked them

How my ex treated me:
Would always accuse me of flirting,
I'm a very nice person but to them I was always being over friendly with friends, even if I made eye contact with them quickly as I'm scanning a room, it would be the same old same old. ""You're cheating on me""

So naturally seeing this message my anxiety flared and I felt really anxious about talking to people (I got it when I was out so it wasn't like I could just go home) but I pushed it to the back of my mind as much as I can.
Until I got home, tried to tell my partner about it but the most he got out of me was 
""I'm scared people will think me being nice is me flirting""
""Has anyone said they think you're flirting with them?""
""No""
""Then there's nothing to talk about""
""But my ex-""
""I don't want to hear about your ex, we can tomorrow""

My thoughts tonight about the whole triggered memories.

What if he thinks I'm cheating now that I've brought this up?

Maybe I shouldn't of made eyes contact when scanning the room

What if someone thinks I was flirting?

I love him so much

I hate myself

ampvlk,"First post, so i'm sorry if its a jumbled mess!","&amp;#x200B;

I've known my mother was an abuser since I was nine, but only now (sixteen) am I starting to open up about it to my *close* friends, she emotionally abuses not only me but my father, and has done so with my sister before she moved out and became the GC. I faintly remember snip its of physical abuse or threats towards hurting me when we were alone. I am terrified of her, especially since she has become quite religious (believes its the end days). My anxiety is easily triggered by her as she stomps loudly (literally the house shakes not even joking), when she eats she doesn't close her goddamn mouth! and other things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to being sexually assaulted (/s) at the start of high school when I was 12 for 2 years and her abuse I can't be touched without going into panic, which is hard to avoid because my mother always forces me to hug her and her side of the family has no boundaries. Her abuse has eased up over the years but the toll its taken on me mentally is overbearing, I've bottled all of this hurt in me that I feel like I'll have a mental breakdown sooner or later.

&amp;#x200B;

She also restricted me from going to school, thus causing me to be *waaay* behind and now causes me severe anxiety when I don't understand something I should have. I remember I started online schooling in grade 4 and she ended up pulling me out for a year until I returned to my old school, in which I was bullied from day one to when I graduated to high school.

&amp;#x200B;

She has told me numerous amounts of times how she wish she never had me and the next day she says that she is so grateful I was born (was planned through IVF with a 5% chance of happening). I am far from the perfect daughter. I know that. But you should never tell your child that you regret having them!

When my ex and I split he was still very shook up by what happened to him as a child and it wasn’t resolved. Unfortunately because of this I’m on very high alert when it comes to my son. 

Is the following concerning? 

This morning my son asked to be naked (he did that lastnight too) so I got him naked thinking nothing of it, then asked me to “touch woodsy(not sure on the word but this is what it sounded like) soft” and he then touched it and I asked him to repeat himself and he said “momma touch woodsy soft?” I refer to his penis as “penis” so this isn’t a word he got from me. But I’m not sure if him asking me is age appropriate curiosity or alarming signs.",Sugartits333,2019-02-03 08:22:13,4,222,21.53,50,80.34,13.56,17.08,10.81,95.05,59.46,23.87,17.12,9.01,0,0,8.11,0,6.76,3.6,13.51,7.21,4.5,10.36,3.15,14.41,5.41,2.7,1.8,1.8,0,3.6,1.35,2.25,0.9,0.45,0.45,18.02,4.95,0,1.35,12.16,11.26,3.15,0.9,0.45,1.35,1.35,5.86,3.15,0,0.9,2.25,2.25,1.8,0,2.25,0,4.95,0,0.45,2.7,0.9,0.9,7.66,5.86,1.35,16.67,1.8,4.95,9.91,0.45,0,1.35,0.45,0,0,1.35,0,0,0,0,0,13.96,4.5,0.9,0,0,0.9,0,0,2.7,2.25,2.7,0
amusxp,My dad is abusive. Help,"I am a female from Pakistan and am Muslim, I live in Canada (incase that helps towards understanding this). My dad is always emotionally torturing my mom or me and my sister. He just beat me right now and my knee stings so bad. He is always fighting with us. My mom won't leave him. Even if she did we would all be screwed because she has no job (is taking her exams to be a doctor). He is so short tempered and manipulative. He has two personalities, one that he shows in front of others and one he uses towards us. He told me if he left us (which he has threatened to many times) I would have no value and would live on the streets. He also stares at other woman and I saw on his phone a few years ago he had signed up for a dating app. My mom doesn't do anything about the staring problem and I never told her about the dating thing (I lost the proof anyway). He stares at girls my age since I was like 13. He is so perverted I feel like a lot of Pakistani men are like this. My dad is the reason I went through depression when I was 11-13 (I'm 15 now) and cut and almost killed myself. I hate him so much but there is nothing I can do.

amwbx6,Mutually Abusive?,"Hey guys, I'm new here but I'm posting because I feel like I've lost my grip with reality.

My ex and I dated for two years. During the two years, a lot of turbulent things happened. He abused me, a lot. I cut off my parents for a bit during this time and I think he took advantage of this to hurt me a lot - physically, emotionally, and psychologically. He cut me off from my friends (for example - ""why do you want to go eat lunch with her? Do you not love me enough to Skype me?""). He wouldn't let me drink. The funny thing is he lived with his parents or rather his parents lived with him so I could only see him a couple of times a week (he kept saying he paid for everything). He would hit me and he would beg so I would take him back. This kept happening and after a few months I tried to kill myself because I felt so lost and hopeless.

After the attempt I started to stand up for myself and told him that he needed to fix things. Then I found out he never graduated college, he was in debt, and his family was helping him financially. He kept these lies from me for a year and half at that point. I lost it and said that he really needs to fix things or I leave. But he would never fix things. I would yell at him or be really mean to him in conversations. The last six months, all he did was chase after me but never fix anything I wanted fixed. It got so bad that I constantly kept wanting to die and telling him that I wanted to die.

We broke up. And now for the next 6 months we've been fighting. I want to get back together. I want him to make up those promises. I want him to show him the same loyalty and faith I showed him when he was so abusive. I keep telling him I want to die because I feel taken advantage of. Every time he says no, I tell him this and he sees it as manipulation whereas for me - it's the truth. I don't know what to do. This is a terrible situation and I need help.

**tl;dr** my ex and I broke up because he was abusive and wouldn't deliver on promises. I want to get back together so he can basically show me the same love and faith I showed him so I keep chasing after him and telling him I want to die.

amxixy,Believe me.,I just posted today about how my adopted parents were abusive and people are already commenting and stating exactly “i don’t believe you.” How do I get people to believe me?? My adopted parents are two married gay dudes (just for reference and knowledge). And every time we try to go to the police to report past abuse (because none of us live under their house anymore thank god- though there is one child In Their possession still..) and they literally say we can fill out an incident report but “you’re just mad about something that happened in the past.” And do nothing further! My adopted parents are soo two faced. Just a few months ago my roommate was threatening to hurt me and was taunting me in the night trying to break into my place and my adopted parents just say “things will get better eventually.” I recently found my biological family and they immediately said you can live with us till you find a place! They deny everything they ever did and I don’t know if it’s because they don’t remember or because they’re just assholes and more narcissistic and all than I’m starting to realize. Having a good house itself and food and clothes doesn’t mean everything. ,you_know_it_already,2019-02-03 19:34:43,7,212,10.28,71.43,91.52,8.74,17.67,21.23,94.81,58.02,18.87,15.09,8.02,1.89,1.89,0,3.3,3.77,3.3,9.43,10.38,8.02,11.32,2.83,20.75,3.77,2.36,0.94,1.42,2.36,4.25,1.42,2.83,0.47,2.36,0.47,15.57,2.83,0.94,0,0,14.62,5.19,2.36,0.47,2.36,3.3,2.36,1.89,0,1.42,0.47,3.3,0.94,0.94,0.47,0.47,10.85,5.19,1.42,2.83,1.89,0.47,6.13,16.04,0.94,14.15,0.47,5.19,8.02,1.89,0.47,1.89,0,0.47,0,0.94,0.47,0,0,0,0,15.57,4.72,0,0,0,0.94,0.94,0.47,2.83,3.77,1.89,0
amzsjj,Part of my story,"I recently stopped talking to my extremely abusive father. Wanted to see what yall think of the messages that made me do it, though. Here's a bit of backstory. 

He had a group chat which my spouse and I left because it's for his business and we haven't been a part of it for years and are honestly sick of his shit. Plus us being in it is not fair to the ones who are active in it. 

I sent a message to the chat. I said ""hey since me and spouse have not been a part of this for a while, we do not feel it is right to stay in this group."" Then we left. 30 seconds later I started getting messages from him, and as you can see they went unanswered. 

Let me explain a few things. The grandma he refers to is his mom, who was also very abusive to me. They ""raised"" me. My mom has never been a part of my life and that's her choice. 

However, I was kept from seeing that side of my family until 2010. We all (minus mom) have a loving relationship with one another now, and I am very happy about it. 

This pisses my abusers off to no end. Also, dad thinks this is about my spouse not liking the same football teams lol. My spouse posted on his own Facebook about a game we were watching, and dad took offense and commented on it. 

Also, none of my family messaged my husband. Just me because they know how to get to me. Here are the screenshots. Sorry this is so long.

an0lcr,Can someone just talk to me?,"Hello I apologize for grammar mistakes in advance because English is not my native language. If this is the wrong subreddit please tell me where I could post this.

I've never told anyone about this, but I just can't keep it inside anymore. I live in Switzerland. I'm almost 16 and my father is physically and mentally abusive towards my mother. He hits her and throws things at her. He's also verbally and mentally abusing me and my sibling. He tells us cruel and degrading things. He's so unpredictable. If he's mad he can find EVERY reason to scream at us. I've had two surgeries on my right leg and I need to walk with crutches now. He doesn't show any empathy and he's emotionally so cold. He still treats me the same way. Even if I cry and tell him to stop hitting my mother, he would still scream at her and doesn't care about me crying. My mother won't leave him because she has no job and in the job market of my country she would only find an irregular part-time job that pays you very lowly. She couldn't support us financially if she left him. My mother doesn't have a good education so she could never find a well-paid job. I've told my mom about safe houses where victims of abuse can live (don't know how it's called exactly) but she always says that her sister (my aunt) went to one of those safe houses with her children and the living situation there is bad. My aunt said that you needed to live with a lot of other families and there are always little kids crying there. After a few days living there my aunt went back to her abusive household. 

About me, I'm a really good student and I always get high grades but my father is so crazy that he always compares me to other people and points out that they can do anything better. He tells my I'm stupid, worthless and I will never get a good job. WTF I already have high academical achievements. I will graduate in 2022 and then I can go to university. This seems like such a long time for me. I don't know how I can cope with him for such a long time. I thought about contacting my school psychologist but I'm always too ashamed to ask the school secretariat about how I can arrange an appointment with him. I'm always afraid that my classmates will somehow find out about it. Can someone just talk to me here? Does anyone have tips how I can survive against his abuse? It seems like everyone has the perfect family. Sometimes it really gets to me what he screams at me.

an5d9d,Surviving abuse and pressing charges (UK). I’m open to your stories and advice as I go through this myself.,"In October last year, I left a very violent and emotionally abusive relationship with my partner of almost 4 years.
We have no children together, although he has two of his own. I love his kids and until now, that has been the main prevention from breaking the secrecy I’ve been complicit in for all of this time.

But i realised that it is the secrecy that protects abusers. They use innocent others as their shield, to protect against the consequences of their actions. 
I am past the point of wanting revenge, and in fact I still don’t feel like I want anything bad to happen to my ex or anything that would hurt the children. I am reassured by the fact that they have a good mother, and they mainly live with her. And I do want to do the right thing. I will tell of what I’ve been through and then it is out of my hands and the law will take its course. His remorselessness and denial has convinced me that this is the right thing to do. It may protect someone else. It may make him wake up to reality. It may be futile, but I want to try. I don’t feel strong, and I’m not, but if I don’t do this, I will regret it and I will never respect myself.

I have reported it to the police and I am expecting to give my full statement very soon. 
I did not research extensively what is involved because I did not want to put myself off. I know it will be exposing for me and I know that it may be difficult to be believed. I hope that the therapist who worked with us (a token gesture from him to pretend he would change) can testify that he admitted to repeatedly attacking me, that one time I even had to go to hospital and that the physical abuse was severe and that he admitted to it, he just didn’t think it was wrong enough to stop. I hope that my friend who offered me a safehouse and witnessed my suffering many times, and who was the only person who knew for a long time will be taken into account as evidence. I hope my friends who took me in in London when i fled from a hotel will be believed as well. And I hope that my pictures of one of the grevious injuries I suffered will help.

In truth, I fear that it can be turned against me somehow. But I probably have nothing to lose. I think my friends will stand by me.
I am afraid for my safety because he knows where I live and we are in the same town. For him, this is ultimate loss of control and I don’t know how he will react. But I hope the people I’ve now told, who believe me and know that I am reporting it will act as my safety net because if anything were to happen to me now, he would be taking a huge risk and he would not be able to get away with it or keep it a secret and if I am able to record it and report it, I will. I hope that keeps me safe.

If anyone in the UK has taken this route, or wanted to and knows what I’ve let myself in for, I am ready to hear it now. I have started the process and I am ready. I suppose I mainly want to hear positive stories and legal advice. I already know of the struggle of victims getting justice for things that aren’t happening right this second and aren’t easy to prove. Well, from the media anyway.

I also want to offer encouragement to anyone thinking about leaving. It’s hard, it is the fucking pits. But it’s better than what you’re living now - it has more hope and more friendship and potential than you can imagine right now.

an688u,My boyfriends mom hits him,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 9 months, we really get along and he treats me like a princess. Im 18 and he is 17. He moved 800 miles away (to California) about 7 months ago.

His mom is extremely abusive. She hits him so hard, in the past he has needed stitches in his mouth and she has broken his nose. She leaves bruises on the sides of his face. She does it over little things, like him not bringing grocery's inside fast enough (that was the time when he needed stitches). He says when he tries to cover his face, she just hits harder, so he just has to let it happen. He cant really defend himself because he will get kicked out, his parents are holding his college fund over his head (including money he earned himself and what his grandfather left to him).  He has been kicked out before, slept on the street for I think a week when he was 16. 

My mom is aware of the situation, she says that a spot is always open for him at our house. The only issue is that again, they are holding his college money over his head.

His parents are out of town and coming home today. They found out he skipped school this morning and he is just waiting for his beating. Im in a call with him right now, just kind of waiting for them to get home. 

I dont know what to do anymore. I try to be as supportive as I can but it is hard. If anyone has any advice on what I can do to be there for him, or what I can say, it would really help. Thanks

TL;DR: My 17 year old boyfriend is abused by his mom pretty bad, he cant leave or move out, I need advice on what I can do to be there for him.",InformalAnon,2019-02-04 12:56:22,4,328,20.84,90.49,3.44,21.1,16.4,10.06,92.68,63.72,25.3,20.43,4.88,0.61,0,14.02,0.91,4.88,3.05,14.33,11.59,5.79,5.79,1.22,19.21,2.44,1.83,2.44,2.13,0.3,2.13,0.91,1.22,0,0.61,0,21.65,2.13,0.91,3.35,13.41,7.93,1.22,0.3,1.52,2.44,0.61,3.05,2.13,0,0.91,0.91,2.74,2.13,0.3,0,0.3,6.71,2.74,0.91,1.83,1.22,0.61,4.57,15.55,0.61,16.46,2.13,8.23,6.4,1.22,0,0.91,1.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.8,5.79,4.27,0.3,0.3,0,0,0,0,0.3,1.83,0
an7j90,My emotionally/sexually abusive and toxic grandma is dying and idk how to deal with it,"This is a pretty long and ranty read, since there’s so much to say about my grandmother. I’m sorry in advance. 


I grew up in a traditional Asian (Laotian) household. So most of us don’t believe in nursing homes or whatever , a lot of Lao households have their elders live with them until they pretty much kick the bucket. I live with my parents (both 45) , my two little sisters (18 and 13) , and my paternal grandmother (85). My grandmother took care of me and my sisters while my parents were out working during the day. She’s taken care of me and my sisters since we were born.  She’s lived with my family for as long as I can remember. 

My grandmother is extremely emotionally abusive , toxic and negative.She has no friends , has burnt bridges with other family , and picks fights with everyone she meets. 

She’s been through 3 marriages, her first one ended because her husband died in the Vietnam War , and the past 2 ended because both men left her. She has a son in Laos (my uncle) , that refuses to speak to her and had attempted to run away when he was 13 , and another son , whom is my father. My Uncle married twice , the first wife leaving because of my grandmother. 

My grandmother and my father never got along. They constantly got into screaming arguments growing up. She always belittled my father and his thoughts/opinions. She hid letters from my grandfather (2nd husband) to my father from Laos. When my mother and father first got married (they were 18) , she controlled them financially ,demanded their paychecks and would only give them a certain allowance. My mother was raised to be very submissive to her husbands family so she never questioned it. This didn’t stop until I was born 2 years later , which still became an issue since my grandmother claimed all of the money in their joint bank account was hers (which had money that my parents had given her). My grandmother was emotionally abusive towards my mother. She constantly cussed at her , put her down for everything she did , and called my mother terrible names that my mother never even heard of before. My family at the time lived in a big urban city(If I say which one it’ll be obvious who my family is to other Lao ppl , it’s a small group of us everyone knows everyone haha) , in a small community with other Lao refugees. My grandmother never got a long with any of the neighbors. She constantly picked fights with them and even almost got into a fist fight with one of the aunties on our block. She would get mad at my mother for setting aside dinner for our next door neighbors (which is an old custom in Laos). My grandmother had a bad reputation in the Lao community, no family allowed their daughter to marry my father because of how she is. (My mother was the one who said fuck you to everyone and married my father anyway.)
When I was 5 , my mother got into an almost fatal car accident while driving my grandmothers car. The car flipped 3 times over the freeway and hit a light pole. My mother came out fine with no injuries at all. It was a miracle. But my grandmother was furious that the car was totaled. 

I do not have many positive memories of my grandmother. When I was in diapers , I have memory of her molesting me, something that I’m still trying to process . (I haven’t told my family, i remember it happening but then I put it away for a few years until it comes back randomly) She constantly belittled me for being overweight , or too dark skinned. (She was known for being the “fairest of them all”, she was extremely colorist and took it out on me). When I started to reach puberty , she began telling me I was a whore. I used to go outside and play with my neighbors , whom were guys and girls. She told me that all I did was sleep with all the guys in our neighborhood. I was 11 years old when this started. In my adolescent years to now I had a very negative view on my appearance. I used to think it was the Lao community’s view on beauty as a whole. But other Lao elders never commented on my weight or my skin. Only her.

When my middle little sister was born (I was 4), my grandmother claimed she wasn’t my father’s daughter, and accused my mother of sleeping around. My little sister looks a lot like me , only difference is she’s very fair skinned. So growing up I saw her hit my little sister a lot harder than she would hit me. My little sister would have red marks on her face from being smacked so hard. My parents would confront my grandmother about it but she wouldn’t stop. She called my little sister nasty names and never showed any of us any real love or affection. 

When my youngest little sister was born, my grandmother decided she didn’t want to take care of us anymore. She claimed we were too much work, but refused to move out because 1)she had nobody to move in with 2)she has no money to do so. My mother tried accommodating by putting my youngest sister in daycare, which is almost unheard of in Lao families that has a grandma at home. This ended up in more arguments and fights. 

Fast forward to now. My grandmother spends her days complaining out loud about little things and talks to her distant fake friends on the phone. She was recently diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. It started because she claimed our neighbors were doing voodoo on her. But once they moved , she claimed I was doing it. She claims that I’m putting spirits or demons in her room which is why she’s kept up at night and can’t sleep. She used to knock on our neighbor’s door claiming we’re leaving her alone to die on purpose when we all left to either school or work for the day. She also claimed that my parents physically abused her and she would walk to the police station by our to report us. (This of course is untrue). I’ve seen her slowly decline these past 2-3 years. Her old age is getting to her. She walks slower now and needs help doing basic things. We share a bathroom in the house and most of my duties are to clean whatever diarrhea didn’t make it to the toilet. She refuses to wear adult diapers. It’s a fucking mess. 
She has these outbursts of anger where she’ll begin sobbing loudly in the middle of the house if we ignore her for too long , and she will begin calling distant family members that she’s dying. 
My mother cooks her food and my grandmother complains it’s never good. But she’ll eat it anyway when she gets hungry. 
Now she constantly knocks on my bedroom door calling me a whore again. She knew I had a boyfriend (I’ve only brought home one guy to meet my family , but we broke up since he joined the military). She yells at me and says he left me because I’m a whore and my pussy is loose. (She says this in Lao but that’s the best translation I can come up with). 

Everybody in our house can’t stand her. We’ve all learned to ignore her and deal with her the best we can without pulling our own hair out. Anytime I’m around her I feel anxious and upset. Just her presence makes me nervous. 
You might ask well why don’t you put her in nursing home? I ask my parents the same question but my father refuses. He feels a sense of guilt if that were to happen. My grandmother has nobody else to move in with, my father is all she has. Either we put her in a home , let her be homeless , or let her stay with us until she dies. 

I give my grandmother another few months or a few years until she dies. And I don’t know what I should feel when she does. I feel guilty that thinking of her death makes me happy. I know she’s miserable on the inside , and knowing that the misery she feels and the misery we feel will end soon gives me peace. But she’s my grandmother , I’m her blood. She’s the only grandparent I’ve ever known. Both of my grandfathers have passed away, and my maternal grandmother is in Laos. She took care of me and my sisters while my parents worked. Even tho she was abusive she still fed us and made sure we got off the buses after school. But I have no true love for her at this point. She makes me only feel negative emotions. I don’t know what to feel and it makes me anxious. How do I deal with the death of a toxic family member? Most people are sad when their grandmother dies , but I don’t feel any kind of sadness thinking of her death. 



TLDR; My sexually/emotionally abusive , toxic and negative live in grandmother who borderline raised me and my sisters is going to die soon, and I feel guilty for being happy she’s on her last limb. How do I deal with her death and am I normal for not feeling sad about it.",lotus_flowa,2019-02-04 15:00:22,2,1612,26.71,77.92,59.59,7.71,15.8,15.63,93.24,57.57,23.14,18.49,9.18,1.67,0.19,6.58,0.87,4.65,4.16,12.53,8.81,5.09,7.13,2.17,18.73,3.91,1.61,2.11,1.74,2.23,4.96,1.67,3.23,0.62,1.3,0.62,20.22,6.14,0.74,9.74,1.92,10.67,2.17,1.99,0.81,2.17,1.86,2.67,2.61,0.74,0.74,1.05,2.36,0.56,0.87,0.5,0.5,9.24,5.52,0.81,1.8,1.24,0.25,6.89,9.8,0.62,15.82,2.3,7.26,6.7,0.93,0.87,2.05,0.5,0.12,0.87,0.87,0.37,0.31,0,0.06,0.19,14.7,6.2,2.92,0,0.06,0.12,0,0.06,0.12,2.79,2.23,0.19
ana7yq,What does it really mean to be a survivor,"As a small child I saw this man who I thought was someone that was opening his home to us, my mom, sister and I. As a safe haven, of love and peace. At 6 yrs old you honestly have no say so in were you go when your a child of divorced parents, you do and go as you're told, even when you scream slightly ""help, this isn't where I wanna be!"" you have to sit there and watch the madness unfold in front of you on a school night, with a test in the morning.. your mom ends up screaming and you hear the pounds of things getting thrown around and him hitting her, you hear her tears breaking through the cries of ""stops!"" and vulnerability of being powerless. Your older sister escapes the bedroom window at midnight that leads into the woods, a few hours pass and theres cops surrounding your door at the early morning hours and this monster finally gets put into a cop car, you finally get to leave the bedroom and walk down the long dark hallway that passes your moms bedroom,  its messy, bloody, and broken glass every where. You hear your mom and run for her but shes in the back of the ambulance with some men covered in just a white blanket, with blood all over her face. She says, ""hey sweetie, it's ok you're dad is on his way to pick you up for school."" At 6 yrs old you have no idea what hell just started to unfold in your life for the next 4 yrs, this hell, you'll carry on with you for the rest of your life. No therapist, no drugs, no amount of endless love and self pity will ever fill this giant hole of ""how did I end up as this child.""

anardp,What counts as abuse? Is my father abusive?,"I need some peace of mind. I need to know that  I am not crazy for thinking that my dad is abusive..my mom constantly tells me that he isn’t and I’m “believing lies about my father.” 
he has hit me, pinched me, thrown things at me. He even broke down the door to my room. 
Has called me names like slut or bitch, and has threatened me. 
Could he be charged with anything if I told the police? 

I really want to get a restraining order or something on him bc I have a little sister who’s still living at home (I’m moving out next month, I just turned 18) I don’t think she should have to deal with this kind of shit though, but he’s really bipolar and he has cop friends who I think he could convince that he isn’t in the wrong. also my parents are very wealthy and my mother would probably take his side even though she really does hate him...so I don’t know if I could legally do anything?

I do have proof though, I have videos of him verbally abusing me, basically telling me I’m trash to him and nothing I’ve ever done is right and he doesn’t support anything I do. But would that stuff even help?

Pretty much right now, I can't work here for a least 3 years. Need help with bills and my aunt/uncle refuse to help. Even though they'll go out of there way to help my 17 year old sister! 

I asked for them to cover my freaking phone bill of 55$ . They said no even though. They pay for my sisters bill. It's pissing me off cause they favor her over me obviously! My sister got to live with them. While I got nothing and got abused emotional on a daily bases! 

I'm sick of it! I feel like they don't give a shit about me. 😭 You want to know there excuse for not taking me in? 

• I don't want to hurt my relationship with my sister. 
• This experience will make me stronger 
 Note: it sure as fuck didn't! It just fucked me up emotionally 
• Your to much to handle

My uncle said to me that he'd only had bring me in as a teen. if it was a physical or sexual abuse. How the hell is that helpful?! My family should have been there! But they refused to help and said it was my problem!

My brother wouldn't help either and left me standing. He has a freaking 5 bedroom house with only him and his girlfriend living there! He could have helped but didn't! 

I just want a family that can love me for who I am. A wife to cuddle up to and hug. My sisters getting that right now! When I prayed every night for the abuse to stop and a least a girlfriend to me it all better nothing happened! That's why I'm a freaking atheist! Cause if there was a god it wouldn't have allowed this abuse to happen! My family's could have stepped in at any moment but they didn't. 

It's not far, I couldn't graduate high school cause of my about of stress! I could never sleep or concentrate! But no my aunt and uncle didn't want to believe that! They though it could all be controlled! No one listens to me! I just don't know what to do anymore! I want to move on with my life but I just have a lot shit bottled up!

andiy2,Should I confront my ex-abuser / pedophile 'boyfriend'?,"When I was 14 years old (I'm F) I met a 27 year old man at a campsite. We became friends over the few days we were camping together. He initiated contact because I had cold hands and he got me to warm my hands on his stomach. This was in a public cafe. Now I know this is a very weird and creepy thing to do, but at the time I thought it was normal, or that I was special and he liked me. Within a few days he got me to sleep in his tent and kissed me. He didn't try and hide it from the people around him. 

  
At the end of the camping holiday my family came to pick me up. I staying in contact with the Man who lived in a nearby city, via e-mail. Within a few weeks I was convinced he was my 'boyfriend' and that we were together. I went to visit him a few times on the train and persuaded my parents to allow me to stay at his house. They were very reluctant, I didn't mention he was my 'boyfriend' and I told them I would be sleeping in the spare room. I don't blame them at all for this, although now when I look back at it I sometimes get confused how they allowed it. My mother had cancer at the time and was sick and my father was away working abroad a lot. I was a very stubborn child, and remember my mother literally chasing me down the road me trying to stop me seeing him at one point, although not the first time I stayed. I do remember my parents fought hard for me not to go a lot of times but in the end I still went. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I stayed at his house (I was still 14 at the time, the age on consent in my country was 16) we were kissing on his bed and making out. He did not physically force me to do this. Later on in the kissing we had sex. We didn't talk about having sex in advance,  I remember being very surprised when he pushed his penis into me. It hurt a lot, I wasn't expecting it, he wasn't using a condom. I pushed him off after a short while, and we didn't talk about it. I slept in his bed that night. This was the weekend.   


When I went to school the following Monday I told a friend of mine who was shocked. They took me to the Drs. and got me the morning after pill.   


For some reason I don't understand I carried on seeing this man. His friends and housemates all knew about our 'relationship'. I went on the pill, and we started regularly having sex. Eventually I stopped going to school so much and spent more and more time at his house. My parents were not happy with this, and did try very hard to stop me. They tried everything, taking me to the Dr, speaking to the Man himself about it, out right banning me from seeing him, letting me see him but not letting me stay over. They did try everything but ultimately the 'relationship' was able to continue. He almost never came to our house, and never stayed over I would go and stay with him.   


All sorts of drama happened, including my mother eventually finding out about the morning after pill, and then finding out I was on the pill. Asking me outright if I was having sex with him, and me telling her the truth. This lasted for about a year, he even broke up with me at one point but we got back together. I stopped going to school, got very sick and depressed, got put on some terrible anti-depressants which made me feel even worse (Seroxant). 

&amp;#x200B;

This all went on for about 2 years in total. All his friends who were aged 26+ knew what was happening, as did his housemates. One of his friends strongly objected, but did come around eventually. I would stay at his house at least 4 nights a week for about 2 years, having sex with him regularly. I thought I was in love with him. He was a weird guy, he had enough money to not work, but not to live a lavish lifestyle. He spent a lot of time on the computer, and lived like a student without the drinking and partying. He was quite boring, and what I would now see as a total 'loser'. He was quite social though and had a lot of friends he saw. He spent a lot of time watching TV playing computer games, acting a bit like a manchild. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually when I was 16, a switch just flipped in my head. I was still living at home but spending lots of time with him. I had re-enrolled in a school program to pass my GCSE's and despite having missed nearly two years of school (due to him but also due to other reasons before we met) I managed to pass my exams , etc. Anyway, back to the switch which flipped in my head. I was busy for three weeks doing an activity without him. I felt by this point he was not so interested in me any more. I decided to not contact him to see how long it would take for him to contact me. Three weeks later I still hadn't heard from him. This was unusual, he normally called, texted and emailed a lot. I contact him to tell him I didn't want to see him any more. He was upset, and told me he didn't realise he was being 'tested'. After that I never saw him again.   


I'm now in my early 30's. I didn't speak about this for a long time, and in my family we didn't talk about it either. Life went well for me once I 'left him' and I just left the past in the past. My mother has recently died, and we didn't talk about it before she died. I actually moved to the city he lived in for a long time but avoided the area. I once saw him in a market but I don't think he saw me.   


Looking back at this all now I find it very hard to understand. Why was I attracted to him in the first place? But more importantly why, why was he attracted to me? When I turned 27 the idea of me or any of my friends of my age 'dating' a 14 year old girl was totally ridiculous. It would have never happened and we probably would have called the police if it did! I find it very hard to understand why his friends all went along with it as if it was normal. Why did he ask a 14 year old girl to put his hands on her stomach? Even though our relationship did grow in a sexual one, the first time we had sex it was basically rape, I was not expecting it, or wanting it or consenting to it, even if you ignore the fact I was not even old enough to consent.   


I now understand what my parents were trying to tell me, which was that a 14 year old can't understand this. A 14 year old doesn't see the power dynamic involved, or what sort of weird lame adult wants to date a child they can easily impress, I think I enjoyed the freedom of being treated like an adult. But I was a bit obsessed with him. I think it's normal for a 14 year old to have a inappropriate crush, but it is not normal for the adults involved to allow it to evolve into a relationship. I was pretty headstrong in going along with it all, but I still don't understand it. The adult me knows only a sick, weird horrible man would seek a relationship with a child anyway. I have had partners as an adult but I never really told them about any of this, or if I did I massively skirted about the details.   


I don't know why I am thinking about it now. I have found the man on facebook (not added him). He is using the same photos he used to send me when he was 27 (over 11 years ago). He literally looks like a classic pedophile. (I know this isn't a thing, but image a stereotypically image of a pedophile, and bang there he is. \*Puke\*). Part of me wants send him a message and ask him about all of this. But I don't want to give him access to my life. Part of me wants to tell the police and get him put in jail, but that is a bit of a fantasy as I couldn't bear a trial. Part of me wants to warn his girlfriend, what if he gets into contact with another child it fucked them up more than me. I just don't understand how it could have happened. Maybe its best to forget it all and leave it in the past but its hard to understand. I don't know what to do next?   


TLDR: When I was 14 (F) I had a 27 (M) boyfriend who had sex with me for 2 years. WTF? Only recently realised how weird this is. Now what?

anfun9,Was he really abusive?,"This is gonna be long and I apologize in advance. It is very hard to keep it short, I hope people will read this.   


I've recently ended the friendship with my best friend of 7-8 years. It started because of an argument about something pretty ridiculous that made me realize that the friendship wasn't healthy. I was argueing with my best friend (Let's call him Azra) for hours because I made a sexual joke with my boyfriend (which I do with everyone) and Azra claiming that it was an intimacy he was not comfortable with. I was not comfortable with him sexualizing our relationship and tried to tell him that and that our joke was not sexual flirting. We argued about this for hours where I was anxious, sweaty and exhausted. That made me realize that the friendship wasn't healthy.  
For some context, my dad has been emotionally abusive towards me (being annoyed or yelling whenever I made a mistake, not caring about me or whenever we argued and he ""apologized"" (which was rare) he'd always critizize what I could've done better, which messed me up greatly). Azra was my best and only friend for quite some time (we were friend for 7-8 years) but I've recently realized how much he is like my father.   
For the most ridiculous things, I'd get screamed at. I got screamed at that I was an asshole and told that he'd like to break my neck (In german it's more of a figure of speech) and he ripped my beanie off of my head, because I made an ""Ew Gryffinor"" comment about the color of his hat. The reason? He was pissed because we pressured him into buying a color he didn't like (we all wanted to get beanies, neither me nor my two friends remember wanting to get a different color which he insists upon). I was close to tears (something both of the other friends noticed knowing me for two days but Azra didn't) and later apologized, feeling like shit because I was mad at Azra. I really felt terrible because I was not able to see what I did wrong.   
Azra has agression problems (he admits to that himself) and uses that as an excuse whenever I have a problem with him, telling me that I should know what person he is., That I should understand that he has agression problems. That that somehow makes it okay and not his fault. This messed me up pretty badly. I was telling myself that if I made my friend this upset that they were in the right, that what he did or whenever he screamed at me, it was okay, He gaslighted me pretty badly to, because whenever we remembered something differently, even when I had evidence to back it up differently, he'd insist that he was right.   
Now, my problem is that I really only remember a few distinct situations where he was extremely shitty to me (mainly when we disagreed).So I'm just still asking myself if he really treated me that badly? Because we had great times too, where he was there when I needed a shoulder to cry on. I still have no idea and I still kind of blame myself for what happened, even questioning if the situations were really that terrible. I was shy and timid, maybe I should've stood uo to him because that could've prevented everything. I don't know if I can really blame him. If I can really blame him. Part of me thinks I'm being in the right, but a part of me thinks that I overreacted, I feel guilty for ending the friendship and hurting him (even though right now he's lying to my friends about me and doesn't really care that he hurt me). Could I have really expected him to know how he hurt me (I tried to confront him but I always got a mad reaction from him when we disagreed). These situations were so rare, is it really okay to label him as an abuser? Could I have prevented it? Should I have acted differently? I don't know if I should've understood him. I just really don't know. I don't know if telling him that he abused me was right, if I was being really truthful. Hell I'm scared that I might not remember shit accurately and am manipulating everyone else and not telling the full story, that I hurt my best friend and that he's in the right in justifying himself.",yeetaccount123,2019-02-05 08:36:14,2,759,5.61,25.49,49.66,1,21.08,17.39,94.86,63.9,27.54,19.24,11.59,1.58,0,5.93,0.13,8.3,3.82,9.35,11.33,6.98,7.91,2.64,19.5,4.48,2.24,3.03,0.79,1.32,10.54,3.16,7.38,0.92,3.29,0.79,13.31,0.26,1.32,0,6.32,18.71,3.82,3.03,3.56,3.69,1.32,6.46,2.24,0.53,0.66,1.05,1.98,1.19,0.13,0.4,0.26,7.11,3.16,1.19,1.45,1.58,1.05,8.56,7.64,0.66,8.56,0.26,4.35,3.95,0.13,0.26,0,0.13,0.13,0,1.45,0.79,0.26,0.4,0,0,15.94,4.22,3.43,0,0,0.79,0,0.26,0.53,3.56,3.16,0

He has no one and is going to spend his entire life in jail. 

Since I was abused by him I've been through multiple severe abuse of cycles with boyfriends ect. 

To the point where most of the things that happened between us pales in comparison.

I was legally consitered an orphan with pretty much no external family besides my maternal grandmother. My mom died when she was only 24. 

The tldr there is, I have no family,  and im so filled with pity for my father. He deserves to be where he is, but he is in one of the worst prisons in the country( Clements TX) and  I feel bad for him regardless. I acknowledge that such perversion to a child is absolutely a mental health issue, but I don't think he deserves an entire life of loneliness and isolation.

aniyym,Is this abuse in dating? I don't understand what happened to me,"37/f dating 32/m 
In the first three weeks, everything is wonderful. He is full of warmth and affection, constantly in contact but without any pressure to rush into titles or change my lifestyle. 

Two weeks into it, I notice only one orange flag. It's that I suspect he has some preferences (in and out of the bedroom, super minor stuff that I'm either indifferent to or excited about, nothing I'm against). I offer to make some adjustments- for example, I suspect he does not like that I just have sweatpants at home, but I also have been thinking about buying some silk pajamas for months, I just didn't want to spend the money if no one would ever see them. So, I tell him I'm going to buy some sexy new home outfits and he can even come help me pick them out. He insists if I change anything ""for him"", I will resent him for it eventually. He seems super resistant to me buying new pjs at all now. He is tense if I bring it up again. I sense that if I do now buy them, he will think less of me for ""changing"" myself to please him. 
 
Three weeks into it, he comes over to my apartment. He's 3 hours late (with explanation nbd) and I've just eaten. He says my breath smells, but doesn't want me to brush my teeth even after I offer. He seems disappointed I have sweatpants on. He seems disappointed the wine I give him has sediment in the bottom of the glass. He says ""your condo looks like an apartment"" in a weird, non plussed way. I feel as though I've disappointed him, but I'm not sure.

The next morning, I apologize for the wine being poor quality. He sends me a text back:
""It wasn't the wine I'm worried about. your breath though""
5 minutes later:
""I mean, that was just offensive""
5 minutes later:
""You know smells are linked to memories, right?"" (laughing face)

I ignore his messages, confused. He sees me not responding and texts an apology. It seems sincere. Maybe he is just joking. I shrug it off. We later have a super weird conversation where he takes a side note from a joke I made to point out that I took public transit and he would never do that. I'm a little taken aback, probably make a face, and I point out I value public transportation a lot, but whatever. I can't force everyone to take it, nowhere near a deal breaker. I forget about this easily, too.

Two days later, we go to dinner. I sit down. He says ""I told my mom about you. I told her you think I'm an elitist. She told me 'if this girl isn't on board with your vision, you need to get rid of her!"" I am immediately hurt, but he spins out the conversation into other topics quicker than I can count. I try to defend myself, ""I never called you an elitist. The fact that you won't take a bus isn't a big deal to me. You didn't have to have that conversation with your mother. I was just trying to impress on you that I don't spend money on things like nice cars or ride shares or shampooing my car if that's a deal breaker for you.""

He then goes into a hypothetical situation where I'm picking up a friend from the airport and they're disgusted with the interior of my car. I tell him my friends are just happy to see me. I'd just be happy to be picked up from the airport.""
""People don't pick you up from the airport?""
""Er, no, not really, they all have boyfriends""
""See, the way I take care of my car conveys that I care about my guests and their comfort. I'm a good host. Maybe that's why no one picks you up""

I start crying. 
He explains he's just contrarian and was trying to ""win"" the conversation. He apologizes. I am still trying to bring the conversation back to the negative conversation he relayed to me that he had with his mother, and why he'd tell me such a thing, especially after he knew my last attempted relationship ended when the guy told his mother I had endometriosis and his mother encouraged him to dump me (and the man relayed that conversation to me). I ask a couple of times if he said anything at all positive about me, but he deflects and I never get an answer. I don't dump him. I am confused. My friends are all wondering if I'm being too dramatic/picky/etc.. I should give him a chance. It's one mistake.

The next day, he is as warm and affectionate as ever, like nothing's happened. My friends meet him and are impressed with how nice and into me he seems.  3 hours later, he criticizes the way I perform in bed, harshly and in the moment. He compares me to the ""hundred or so"" women in bed. He says the prettiest women are the least active, and the most unattractive are the most active in bed, and I am both very pretty but the most 'aggressive' woman he's ever been with. His tone is very harsh. His face looks disgusted and horrified. I hadn't done anything I considered aggressive. I cry harder, he gets up and starts playing guitar.

The next day he dumps me. He says ""I don't do crying."" He points out my breath from that one day. He points out that I didn't make my bed or put extra pillows on it for him. He points out the sweatpants. He says there are differences in ""problem solving"". He says women who are strong and self assured get angry, not sad. he'd prefer if I got angry. He says I cried TWICE in one weekend, he looks at me like this is crazy, you are crazy. He says dating me longer would cause too many 'compromises' on both ends, which I would regret him for, and which would be toxic. He points out that he's not dumping me, because you have to be in an official relationship to dump someone.

ankimu,My [27 F] friend [27 F] confessed to me that her fiance [29 M] is abusive to her since they got engaged. How do I help her?,"(Names  changed) I've been Mary's friend for a couple years now, not super  close but good friends. It surprised me when she asked me and a mutual  friend of ours (Amy) to be her maids of honor after she got engaged. Of  course we said yes though. Mary has been dating her now-fiance Sam for 2  years. Since then, there have been two nights in which Mary has called  Amy or I crying that Sam was exploding and being very verbally cruel to  her and she was scared and didn't have a place to go. She said it's been  like this ever since they got engaged.

I  have tried to explain to her that this is not acceptable behavior for  anyone to have towards someone they love, but she insists that she is  ""used to being treated badly so its okay for her"". (Mary!!!!!!) Even in  casual conversation with friends he will say such calous things about  her in front of her, like calling her ugly or unecessary. I hate hearing  it and always vocalize 'wow that's a sh\*t thing to say, Mary is  wonderful' or something equally cringey-positive, but I can't listen to  that shit. Mary tells me not to worry about his insults to her because  ""she can dish it back"".

Sam has been  through a lot of trauma. He lost both of his parents at an early age and  did not get therapy to deal with that grief. Nowadays he went to  therapy to get medication/an anti depressant/ I'm not exactly privy to  his exact psychological diagnosis, but all I'm trying to say is that I  have empathy for Sam and I know that he is dealing with his own life  messed up trauma/baggage but that does NOT make it okay to use Mary as  his scapegoat everytime difficult feelings bubble up!

My  father was explosively verbally abusive. The abusive stories Mary tells  me about Sam remind me of my father. I guess that's why it bothers me  so much. I have been estranged from my father and mother for many years  because I stood up to their abuse and they wouldn't change, (hello r/  raisedbynarcissists) I am no stranger to how difficult it is to upset  these patterns.

How can I be complicit  in their wedding when I know he is abusive?!? I feel like I am watching  my father and my mother at a young age! How do I help Mary? Should I  talk to Sam about it? He is my friend too. I am not afraid of  confrontation.

anntx9,Is this abuse?,"I need someone to help me figure this out. Right now I’m not sure if this is abuse or if this is just how I feel, so I’m going to explain this as best I can. My parents always seem to find ways to hurt me emotionally. During the school year I feel like I can never get good enough grades. If I get a C or lower, I’m “worthless and never going to make it in the real world”. If it’s a B, “Why didn’t you get an A? Why aren’t you trying harder?” And if I get an A, it’s “Why is it a 95 and not a 100?” It’s exhausting. When I’m no break it’s, “You’ve gotten fat” or “If you eat that you’re going to gain weight”, or “Why are you so lazy” (even if I’ve just cleaned the whole house.) I never feel like I’m good enough and I’m always afraid to talk to my parents because I feel like they’re going to suddenly find a reason to get mad at me. I’ve talked to them about this to, but they always either say “It’s how we were raised,” or “We’re just trying to motivate you.” That second one really bothers me because half the time they just tell me that I’m worthless. How is that meant to motivate me? When I talked to my dad about this he just said “Tough. If you don’t want to feel worthless, then do something to convince me otherwise.” To be clear, I’m not asking if this is abuse for my sake. I’m 18 and away at college right now, but I feel like that treatment is ultimately what led to my severe depression and anxiety, and even a suicide attempt a little over a year ago. I’m asking because I have two younger siblings that they treat the same way, and I don’t want them to end up having as many issues as I have.

anuqcp,parent/kid abuse,"originally this was going to be pretty long, but replaying the details in my head makes me lowkey sad. well my parents (dad and stepmom) beat the living soul out of my stepbro and I was in the room analog to where the beating was taken place. I honestly wanted to break in and stop it, but I am afraid for many factors. My stepmom beat my stepbro up and told him to stay in the closet, but after refusing to do so my stepbro was ordered to go outside. At this moment I wanted to whisper him to come with me and take him out for McDonalds and give him a real talk, but like I mentioned before I am so afraid and my heart beats at a million beats per second during these moments. So after deciding to just go out for a drive I went to the gym to cry in the locker room. How do I help these kids in moments like these. They love our parents unconditionally so I can't call CPS. 

tl;dr parents beat the fuck outta stepbro, how can I make him feel accepted and not just as a nuisance

anwadp,Feeling Hopeless,"CW: domestic &amp; sexual abuse. Throwaway account because yeah.

Was with an abusive husband a thousand miles from home. Had a baby, needed to leave, but was penniless. The only person willing to help out was my mother, who to her credit, has housed us for a year. But she was pretty emotionally abusive to me growing up, and gave into the pressure her pedophile father (now dead) put on her to leave me alone with him, then got jealous of the attention he gave me (she was his first victim). So, she's the reason I was raped before I was even in kindergarten, and honestly I'm kind of scared of her and even though she's mellowed with age, I don't think it's been good for me or my child to live with her. But I'm stuck. I have autism, among other things, so basically, I'm unemployable, and I'm trying to raise this baby alone.

Yesterday my mother said she was going to bed but wasn't going to sleep just yet. so I played with the baby and put her to bed like usual. I told her she could read as long as she was quiet, and went down the hall to work for a bit (I pull in what I can freelancing 30+ hrs a week, but it doesn't pay a lot). My mother's husband passes by her room, notices her light is still on, barks at her to go to sleep. Of course, crying ensues, because she's freaking three years old, so I go to try to calm her down, and then my mother shows up all pissed and stands there in her pajamas and yells at us for several full minutes that she's going to wake everyone up at 5AM tomorrow just like her so they know what it's like not to get any sleep, and ""this has gone on for weeks,"" and ""it's ridiculous"" and she's so accommodating because she hasn't said anything about it and 10PM is way too late for the baby to be awake and blah blah blah and she flounces off and slams the door, and the baby is now screaming and crying because Grandma came in and had this tantrum for no reason without any warning whatsoever.

This isn't the first time this kind of thing has happened, and the baby says things like, ""I don't like living with Grandma and Grandpa,"" and she's afraid to pass their doorway to go to the bathroom at night because their ire is unpredictable. My heart breaks for her, and I feel so powerless. And I can't tell you the kind of awful feelings it produces in me, too, because of my history with my mother and my recent abuse at the hands of my husband, plus with how helpless I feel to do anything for myself or my child, and how humiliating it is to feel like I have to put up with it because I'm too afflicted (or lazy, as she'd probably call it) to be independent.  She doesn't really believe in mental illness and thinks despite the autism, depression, PTSD, etc that there's nothing stopping me from finding and keeping a job that would pay me enough to live on, alone, with a kid.  And I feel like she's entitled to be angry with me because I'm freeloading in her house with my kid because I made a poor choice in marriage. And I also get that living with my impairments is frustrating. Maybe she communicated to me that she didn't want us up so late, but I just didn't ""get the message"". 

All I know is it feels like walking on eggshells, and it feels exactly like being an abused little kid again, and exactly like the stress of living with my ex-husband. And now I have to watch my daughter live with it, because I am too fucked up to Adult. I'm just trying to live my life and get away from a toxic marriage, but now it's just more toxicity; I'm more worried about what I'm going to make for supper for my mother every day than about what I'm going to make my own child. Is she going to come home and scream at me about it that day? Probably not, but you can bet she's watching, and making little tally marks and calculating all of my activities for the day. And it feels like if I could just keep her happy, she won't have a reason to start focusing on me.

I even had to start using the desktop computer for all my activities (work, applications, resume building, taxes, household paperwork, etc), because she told me Grandpa (retired) sees me ""sitting around playing on the phone all day"". I mean, I know older people don't always understand that phones can be used for things other than texting and games, but something about assuming that, and then telling me about it, like she wanted me to know I was being watched, it just really bothers me. I even worry that my favorite location to work in in the house is ""under surveillance"", as it can coincidentally be seen in the background of one of the home security cameras. It's caused me to wonder if they're adding up how many hours I'm working per day to see if it meets their standards, whatever that might be. But that's part of the thing; I'm very literal, and I'm pretty practical. It makes sense to me that you might make living in your home contingent upon some sort of conditions, but it never seems like those are made clear. It's like they're purposefully vague so she can just jump out and start yelling at me about something she seemed fine with yesterday, whenever her boss gave her shit at work and she wants to take it out on somebody. 

Plus, at heart I just feel so alone. I feel ungrateful for wishing for this, because it's been incredibly generous to let us live here for so long, but sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be recovering from an abusive marriage with a mother that made me feel loved. She would say it's a childish fairy tale, and that no such mother exists. But I have a hard time imagining behaving toward my own daughter in such a situation the way she behaves toward me. If I thought for one second I was causing her pain like I feel right now ... And I can't imagine doubting and suspecting her the way my mother does me. Maybe I just don't know what it was like raising a kid with invisible special needs in the early '80s, maybe I was (and am) just difficult, and I'm lucky I don't have the same challenge with my own daughter.

I used to fear being alone and poor because of how unhappy it would make me, but with a kid I just feel positively panicked to find something like stability or security, and yet I've never felt farther from finding it, or more hopeless that I could ever achieve it. I don't even know what to call the situation I'm living in right now, because I am an adult, so by all rights I should be able to leave and support myself. And at one point I was able to do that for almost a decade, but it was a pretty specific situation, and I'm so much less ""able"" now that I went through all this with my ex, not to mention I now have a child to take care of. But because my mother can't be expected to see it that way, maybe she's right in her own way. I have no idea whether to be angry or just feel ashamed of myself for being so useless. I feel like I do a lot during the day to take care of my daughter and spend time with her and see she has what she needs. But measured against what ""normal"" people do all day, it's probably not a whole lot.

ao393m,Help save my ex from someone (got told to move it from /relationships by a mod to here) *LONG*,"So this is ... a complete and utter mess.

Firstly, I'm from the UK.

Basically,  years ago I met this girl online from Cali. We'll call her ""M"" At the  time she was 17? coming up for her 18th, I was 20 at the time.

We  started just chatting and quickly became gaming friends. She was  literally like the female version of me. It's super adorable. I grew to  understand she had some problems with seizures stemming from something  when she was a baby but that didn't phase me.  
As time went on we  started to flirt innocently, growing closer and admitted we had feelings  for each other. (Completely just happened, I didn't expect to fall for  her). We exchanged gifts and I kept them all in a box in my room.

As  we talked more and more, she explained her past few bf's since 14, and  how she had been sexually abused and mentally broken her a few times. I  accepted all this and honestly seemed like I was the only one to even  tried to support/listen and understand everything.

This  is where it slowly started to get into mess 1. Obviously she lived 4.5K  miles away. Even though we hadn't met yet, we had spoken about me  flying over (I had family near her at the time over there so I could  stay between them when I went).

At the  same time, over in the UK, a girl professed her feelings for me (We'll  call her J), a girl who I used to have a crush on years before but never  made the move. I was so conflicted over both that I decided to explain  to M that I didn't want to get to a point I was flirting or playing both  (I hate any kind of cheating etc) and so I explained although I had  feelings for her, I wouldn't continue them at this time, however I would  love to still be friends, in the most polite and respectful manor I  could.

She took this extremely hard and  insta blocked me from everything, aswell as her few friends and family  that knew about me. Of course this took me by surprise at that age, but  eventually things relaxed and I ended up getting with J for nearly 3  years a while after all that happened.

It  was honestly a perfect relationship for the whole time, (though I won't  lie I had thought and wondered how M was doing just because of the  impact she had on my life).  
At one early morning about 1.5 years into  mine and J's relationship, M's best friend sent me a drunk message out  of the blue, saying she was dating an extremely abusive guy and that she  had bought my name up a few times asking for help.  
I tried looking M  up but she had still blocked me on everything, I had no way to get in  contact (her friend quickly went silent aswell). Again I moved on, abit  worried, but I continued on with my life.

Just  over a year ago now, coming up to the 3 yeah mark of me and J, I found  out she was cheating, literally days after my mum had passed away from  illness. These two things aswell as having to become almost the solo  provider to keep our house (with me and my disabled brother) caused me  to spiral into such a dark depression.

8  Months later, whilst cleaning out my room, I found all of M's stuff we  had gifted and I thought I'd just try search.... TaDa! She must have  made a new account on FB because there she was... a few years older,  slightly different but it was 100% her. I sent her a long email stating  if she'd like to chat and just catch up...

Well, she saw it and we caught up everything that had happened over the years.  
She  was in multiple of bad relationships, she had moved out of her home and  moved back, gotten a quite good starter career job, and more.

I  told her everything that happened in my life (My mum loved and wished  to meet her, so she was incredibly knocked and upset when I told her she  had passed).

Over time we started to  talk more and more... and this time she booked flights to come see me  for two weeks towards the end of last year (after speaking nearly  everyday for that whole year).

This is the problem / help needed bit...

Before  she came over, she told me about one particular ex that she ""dated but  never met"", she had done something in America called a Adopt A Soldier  scheme. You basically send letters and are given someone who's an ex  soldier to become pen pals... Well, this got out of hand eventually. He  was 42/43 at the time (46 now I think).  
Won't lie, he's quite wealthy  from being in the army and his management job now, however is married  with 2/3 children. At first it was casual friends but then he started  sending gifts... expensive gifts - ipads, headsets, premium branded  sunglasses, guitar. Etc etc. Obviously this went onto sexual gifts in  return. She said she never met him personally tohugh and finally she  broke loose of the hold he had before we started talking (Guess where  this is going). We'll call this person ""S"" (she stated to him I will  admit that she said many times, if he didn't divorce his wife, they  would stop speaking. He promised many times.. and obviously he never  did)

Anyhoo, skip forward a bit, we meet  up for the two weeks she's over here. It was magical, simple beyond  what the 3 years I was with J was like. We became sexual within the  first few days. Because of her past she had, had extreme sexual problems  through stress and being scared... there was none with me. It was  completely relaxed and on the second night she even cried her eyes out  she had never experienced something so amazing. (I'm a pretty good  person when someone says something in person, I had a weird gift of  being able to tell if it's truth or not &gt;.&lt;)

Anyway,  (coming to an end now) She heads home and for the next few months we're  booking my trip over there (which would've been for this year) and  continued our relationship.

Well. Just  after new years she has a seizure at work and is rushed to the hospital.  She was in a few days then discharged but the way she spoke I knew  something was.... off? different... Her parents (who by this time loved  me because I was so different to her ex's) pushed me aside with any  updates. Her friend kept making excuse after excuse on what was going  on.

Eventually I got a massively long break up message from M with so many loopholes and my 6th sense going off the grid.  
A  week later, finally we managed to skype and bought it all back down to  earth, started chatting again, she admitted her feelings were the same,  to which I said, get better first before our relationship picks up  again. And I basically helped her day to day with remembering all her  pills, documents, medical stuff etc as her brain memory was all over.  Day after her breakup message she also cancelled my flight out of having  the need to recover so they'd be no point to visit..!?

So we started talking everyday again....

Thing  is... she'd start talking about new york randomly every so often out  the blue, and how she felt like she was being pulled to move from where  she was currently. I took it as the after seizure affecting her mind.

Then  the bomb dropped one day whilst we were skyping and her mum came in,  handed M a parcel saying "" it's from him... another one "". I questioned  it and M quickly blew it off. Then another time when we were screen  sharing on skype (she has her iphone hooked to her pc) a text message  from the named ""S"" person. Again quickly got blown off from that.

By  this time, I was sure somehow he was still in the picture. So I asked  about him and she admitted he has sent her lots of stuff since the  seizure however she told him to stop...

Well,  this is now where it's blown up. Her sister, who I've been speaking to  about possibly coming over to Cali next year (I wanted to always visit  and hike around anyway) and she broke down explaining how M has been  behind my back for months now. This ""S"" guy, never stopped pestering  her, they'd met multiple times, he's usually book hotels and she'd say  when he travelled from New York (again he's slightly above average in  wealth). M's sister then sent me screenshots from M's mum and the sister  stating after the seizure he flew out to help her etc, and has been out  multiple times. Screenshots also say not to tell Me, as it'd break my  heart and they trust this guy because he's got money... etc.. (they  don't know about what he's been doing to M)

So her parents, or atleast M's mum is covering up S and M's ""relationship"".  
Well  M and the sister had a massive blow out just before she sent me all  this new info and basically it was stating from M that she will be  moving to New York soon (because S has asked her to), S has bought a  small apartment for them both and they're going to live happily ever  after. He's also going to divorce his wife and they're already planning  their future together, and there's nothing anyone can do about it  - and  proceeded to block her sister.

Now. This is the whole mess.  
Since  last night, I've barely slept. I was googling around trying to find any  info on this S guy. I've currently got his name, some of his addresses I  think, part of his phone number and pictures of him from FB and Insta.  I've even got his current workplace.

Basically,  the main detail I'm trying to find is his wife's number. I want to come  clean and explain everything to her. She apparently knows nothing of   M, and also thinks when S travels it's for work...  
Their kids are  also nearly M's age. It's a completely fucked up situation and although I  care about M, I just want her safe now. This guy is NOT safe. He is  manipulative, shady and a whole lot of other words.

Could  anyone give me advice on what I can do as I've tried ringing Police in  USA and they stated that unfortunately because of their ages, there's  nothing they can do !? Even with me explaining M's medical life.

Hell, I'll even use a site to pay to find S's wife's number to get in contact if it means protecting M... :(!

ao6t6z,Does this count as abuse?,"Hello, i am wondering if what i experienced in the past would be considered any type of abuse or if it’s something less severe. [F17 &amp; M18] 

Me and my ex boyfriend were together when i was around 14/15 years old for 9 months. before this time we were good friends. things escalated and we ended up having sex after around 3 months of being together(i know it was young but being stupid and thinking you’re in love is a funny thing) but after we did the deed i cried for days and something just didn’t feel right. i wasn’t comfortable with what happened and couldn’t bring myself to talk about it. the next time we met he initiated it again and unfortunately i gave in but i cried during this time and he did not stop. he seemed to feel bad after both times and consoled me but i wasn’t sure why i cried. after that we did not have sex again. 

Also he used to insult me occasionally, once telling me he hopes i get hit by a bus, and saying that i date everyone i can. calling me a slut, bitch, cunt, every insult you can think of. he never apologised and never seemed to show any remorse. he would ignore me for days if he liked, until he felt like talking again. 

Also he had a female friend i was suspicious of. they went on a date which i only was informed of the night before, and he then posted a photo of only her on socials. nowhere online did it say me and him were together

i asked him to remove it and he didn’t saying it meant nothing and he only wanted to be with me, but he messaged this girl all the time, spent more time with her than me and hid his texts from her. i broke up with him to find a week later they were together and having sex making me question if he was cheating on me with her.

around 7/8ish months went by and he texts me on snapchat saying he misses me he is really unhappy and admitted he was still with this girl but he didn’t want to be with her anymore. he said things to me like ‘i want to be with you, but if i break it off with her she might do something stupid’ or ‘i can’t dump her, she might kill herself’ ect ect, he told me everything a girl wants to hear that he had changed, he’d never gotten over me and regretted how he acted. eventually he broke it off with her and we got back together.

this relationship lasted 3 months but throughout the course of it he seemed to be worse than before. he had sleepovers with girls at his house and wouldn’t invite me, would ignore me the whole night. a snapchat was posted one of the nights of one of the  girls sitting on his lap touching his face which friends preceded to message me with ‘are you okay with that’ ect and i decided to leave it till the morning. i confronted him after they had left and he told me what i saw was not correct, said i was lying and trying to ruin his friendship with his ‘best friend’ said i was being clingy and jealous of a friendship, and eventually told his best friend all about it and she then messaged me saying what i had seen wasn’t what had happened and had a go at me for causing trouble between their friendship. 

however i had always been suspicious of her as he had a photograph of her in his room(none of me or us) she was his cover photo on facebook(again just her) and he always posted her on socials, he would hang out with her and not me ect. 

alongside this, possibly the worst of all, whenever we were alone he would initiate sex and even if i declined he would push and push until i gave in. i am a small girl 5’1 and he is much taller and bigger than me. i would ask if we could chill and watch a movie and he would move my hand onto his crotch and if i tried to move away he would grab it and hold it there. he would use his own hands to move mine to please him. he would not stop touching me until i said fine. i was always silent when this happened, never said a word, never did any of the work. i didn’t want the harassment anymore and usually after i gave him what i wanted he would leave. he would also try to pressure me into anal sex by trying to insert his penis which i repeatedly said no to however he would still try until i physically had to push him off me. 

to add - on my 16th birthday we went to the zoo, another ex messaged me saying he wanted me back, but i declined. i offered for my boyfriend to read the texts but he said no. on the way back home, i went to grab some drinks and he went through my phone and texts with this ex to try to find out if i was cheating. when i broke up with him a few days later( i couldn’t be with him anymore)  he admitted to me that he went through my phone because he didn’t trust me. is this because he was unfaithful? or something else 
 
i just want to know if this is the makings of an abusive person, if i should be worried about anyone else he gets involved with, and was it abuse? i have developed mild paranoia since being with him and i’m unsure if it stemmed from him or myself. 

Thanks

ao9fdm,Is my brother abusing me?,"I don't know if this belongs here, but here I go.

My brother and I are twins, we were born 5 hours apart, and as we grow older, our relationship is becoming more and more toxic. While we fight a lot and I make fun of him too, a lot of yelling starts one way, through him. When my dad yells at him for not doing homework, or not coming to dinner because he's playing a video game, or when he hasn't practiced his instrument etc. he starts to yell at me or threaten me. While he has hit me on several occasions, he has never seriously hurt me, and the majority of his abuse (if it is) is verbal. He calls me a b\*tch, autistic, retarded or a retard, and a f\*\*\*ot. Recently I got some new wireless earbuds (Bose ones to be exact) mainly because airpods make my ears hurt after a while, but also because my brother was saying I was copying him for wanting airpods/wireless earbuds since he had recently gotten a pair of airpods. The day they arrived in the mail I was super excited, but the moment I opened the box, my brother proceeded to say how ugly they were, how bad they were, basically how they were not airpods. When my nanny told my therapist (who is basically trying to fix and/or improve my brother and I's relationship) incident, she told me that it was abuse, that my brother was abusing me, and that she was worried that I would unconsciously seek people with the same qualities as my brother. 

I should take her at face value, because she is a sibling therapist, but I'm looking for some other opinions. If this is not enough information to go on, I'd be happy to give more in the comments.

ao9st2,Accidentally broke no contact with my toxic ex,"  

TL;DR.  I accidentally made a harassing ex aware of my online presence and now things are escalating again.  

I posted a few months ago about an issue I’m having with an ex-boyfriend who will not go away. Feel free to check out my post history if you want part of the story. Although that was a few months ago, there has been plenty of drama since.  At the end of the year he had escalated to the point that he was creating new email addresses, contacting me at work and simultaneously texting me that he was going to stand outside my car until I left my home. I began researching protection orders, but then I opted for more communication with him at the end of the year and reiterated that I did not want to be part of his life. But that hasn’t stopped his communications. I still regularly receive texts with varying moods and levels of anger. I haven’t communicated with him since I repeated that I didn’t want to be part of his life.

At the end of December, I made a new meetup account with a new email address and pic. I joined a group that was completely different from the ones I had been part of before and went to an event. Earlier this week I joined a new one to RSVP to an event.  I must not have checked all of the members before I joined. I know I usually do. Lo and behold, even though he wasn’t scheduled to attend the event I wanted to go to, he saw me and then RSVPd as well. He has now joined my other group. He hasn’t attended a single event until now. His only two RSVPs were made hours before I started getting messages about it.  But now I’ve gotten several texts and emails from three different addresses. They are very hurtful, telling me that I’m not acting like an adult for corresponding with him, that I’m likely to have a nervous breakdown because I thought of him and telling me that I’m acting like a person with a disability. I’m not trolling him. I don’t appreciate the digs at my mental health. I’m overall still pissed. He doesn’t own social events in this town.  

The folks on my last post recommended no contact at all, and I have been diligently following that.  It has had no impact on his behavior and now with accidentally joining this meetup, I now have another online presence that he is aware of.  It has definitely made things worse as he is outright rude and insulting now. The domestic violence counselors that I spoke to also recommended no contact. So now my question is how to handle my presence on this meetup account. Do I leave my RSVPs as is and no-show these events? Or do I cancel them and therefore give him acknowledgement that I have seen his messages? Does it honestly even matter since my no contact doesn’t seem to have an effect on him?

aoepf3,I think that my best-friend is being emotionally abused by her boyfriend. Am I right? How can I help her?,"Me and my friend “Clara” met at university and we’ve been very close since. We lived together for 2 years so we know each other very well and we message each other throughout the day, every day. I see her less frequently but we try to meet once a month if we can. 

This time last year Clara started dating an acquaintance of her’s called “Ron”. Initially she’d not liked Ron physically or otherwise, but he pursued the SHIT out of her until she caved and went on a date. The relationship developed really quickly which worried me at first because Clara always wears her heart on her sleeve, and I’d not met this guy. Another reason for concern was that Ron was living in Spain for his studies, so they were entering a long-distance relationship. Ron is fluent in Spanish but Clara speaks none, and we’re all originally from England. A massive T&amp;C of the relationship was that the distance was *temporary*, because Ron was sick of Spain and graduating in the Summer. 

After a few months I grew less worried, because Ron seemed really attentive and caring towards Clara. He was constantly sending her loving messages, they’d FaceTime until late at night and they’d send letters. She would visit him in Spain when she got the chance, and he came home to see her when he could. He got her lovely thoughtful gifts and they made plans for what they would do when he returns to England. I was so happy for Clara because she was able to finally trust guys again after having her self esteem crippled by past relationships. 

Ron came back to England around September last year, as planned, and this is where everything went to shit. They seemed to argue whenever they saw each other in person now he was back in the UK. His family were cold and unwelcoming. It came to a head after a month where Ron announced he was going back to Spain because he couldn’t find his dream job in England. Clara was devastated because she’d already invested so much time and money into the relationship. She’d worked a job literally wiping people’s arsed so she could fly to see him and he was unwilling to stick with a good job here because it wasn’t *perfect*. They agreed to try and make things work and he promised he would return as soon as possible, hopefully within 2/3 months. 

Since then things have been awful and I’m really worried. Here are a few of my concerns:

• Ron is constantly convincing Clara she’s “mad” or “overreacting” whenever she voices concerns. A typical response to anything she says that he doesn’t like is “you’re hilariously overreacting” or “my friends would think you’re being a total psycho”. It started off like “lol you’re being silly” and now its more like “stop this you’re being ridiculous”.

• He’s displayed signs of anger and aggression towards Clara. When Clara was having a panic attack Ron started shaking her and yelling in her face to calm down. He yelled at her when she forgot to take her pill and accused her of trying to get pregnant to “trap him”. She’s constantly walking on egg shells and having to second guess his reactions to whatever she says. 

• He is manipulative and uses their distance as a way of punishing her. If she brings up an issue she has or says anything remotely negative he will ignore her for hours or whole days. She can say something as simple as “I’ve had a bad day” wanting comfort and he will say “I don’t need this right now Clara what are you trying to do to me”. If she says something he doesn’t like he’ll delay seeing her or shorten the number of days they spend together. The worst was last month when they had an argument and he sent her about 4 messages in 3 weeks. 

• Ron guilt trips her for spending time with friends. He will passive aggressively tell her to enjoy herself and have a good time. He sent her about 10 missed calls when she was round my apartment (after a family member of mine had died, and she’d told him this). She went to meet with a male friend (who is a homosexual anyway) for breakfast and he flipped his shit at her out of jealousy. He says he doesn’t like me because I “put ideas in (her) head”, when I’m just listening and trying to be supportive of her. He gets mad if she messages me or her mum while she’s FaceTiming him. He says he hates me when he’s met me once for 3 minutes? 

• He has the majority of the power and control which is really fucked up. Her life revolves around him but he’s always out with friends, at work, going for meals etc. He promised her he would be coming back to England at the beginning of their relationship and now he’s backtracked saying he never intended on it. He’d been planning for months where they’d live in England. Now he’s saying she’s “holding him back” and that she’s selfish because she won’t move to Spain (which is nuts cause she speaks no Spanish and wants to remain in the UK). He says she’s ruining career opportunities for him and says she doesn’t want him to succeed. She’s welcomed him into her life but he’s not introduced her to friends and he’s always vague about what he’s up to. 

• He’s cold and shows no affection now. Instead of cute morning messages he now sends sexual fantasies or short messages you’d expect from a distant friend. Its like he’s completely changed as a person, his attitude is unrecognisable. 

• He uses possessive jealous language all the time like “you’re mine whether you like it or not”, “I couldn’t stand seeing you with someone other than me”, “ “you’re my girl and no one else’s” or “I’d kill anyone who looks at you”. He’s started fights in clubs with men who have just looked at her. It might seem a little romantic in some ways to some people but it just feels so creepy to me. Its like he sees Clara as a possession and not a person. He can’t stand anyone else having her but he doesn’t treat her with any respect or show any affection? He says “I can’t believe anyone would make you feel worthless” and when she says he does he flips out. 

• His behaviour has made Clara really ill. She’s lost a lot of weight through vomiting and not eating properly. She was in hospital about 18 months ago for anaemia so I’m really worried she’s going to end up hospitalised again. She’s talking about wanting to hurt and punish herself which is nothing like her, she’s usually so vibrant and happy. She says she’s been ill because of how she’s being constantly let down then comforted again. 

I’m sure I’m missing a lot. Essentially Clara is confused and heartbroken. She feels like she’s grieving for the person she thought she knew but also praying that this is just a phase. Her self esteem is being crushed again and she has such little confidence right now. She can see how bad his behaviour is but she hasn’t got the strength to properly tell him or to leave him. He’s going to South America for 6 months soon too which further proves he has no intention of coming back to England. I think he’s a selfish narcissist and that he’s lured her in then revealed his true colours. He so clearly just wants a trophy girlfriend who’s easy and compliant he even jokes about it. 

I’m terrified that he’ll grind away at her confidence until she agrees to move to another country for him against her will. All she talks about at the moment is Ron and the problems she’s having with him, its about 90% of what she talks about with me.  I have no clue what else to say because I feel I’ve been saying all I can to try and support her and convince her to have some self-respect (without being too forceful). What else can I say and do to help her?

aof1av,how do i move on?,"i dated this guy last year i met through a friend of mine. i wasn’t exactly open to the idea at first as he was very pushy and forced me to do a lot of things id consider out of my comfort zone. and normally i can say no but he was so persistent and played the “oh so you hate me” card whenever i refused to go out with him or do what he wanted. anyway, we started dating and he was so happy about it and i guess all that mattered to me was his happiness.
im the type of guy (yes i am gay) who puts other peoples feelings and happiness before his own. its a habit. 
so time goes on and he starts changing. he dragged me into his drama. caught feelings for other people while with me. i felt trapped and alone since i couldnt leave due to the fact he knew shit about me and would surely tell someone if i left. which he later did. i was also afraid he’d do something to hurt himself if i left. he’d post graphic pictures captioning “if you leave i dont think ill be able to go on anymore..” stuff like that which had me terrified and stuck with someone i didnt love, let alone like and couldnt leave.
he fucked with my head. made all his problems priority and when it came to mine told me i was being stupid and needed to just stop. he would constantly invalidate my existence. tell his friends to come after me and send me death threats after i got mad about him being his usual insensitive self. i tried so hard to be a good person for him. after struggling with addiction and depressive thoughts for months. i still tried to push it aside and be a good person for him.
he would tell me i made him so happy, then the next minute we’d be fighting about something. then it got to the point where i couldnt take it anymore and wanted to just end it all. but after meeting my now best friend. i felt around 5% better. 
then he left. he started dating a girl. he told me he didnt have feelings for her. but then basically told me he was done with me. and that left me broken. of course, i tried to move on. i stopped drinking and tried to surround myself with happier things. but now. for the past month. its all been hitting me. the abuse. the lies. the distrust i had for him. everything.

i dont know how to move on and forget. its not easy. i cant express how im feeling to anyone in my life because they don’t understand. they feel sorry for me and reassure me that things will turn out okay. but they wont if im laying awake all night feeling absolutely numb from what HE did. i dont mean to sound petty or annoying, i just dont know where else to go.

so please. someone. help me.

aohtyu,Was this abuse?,"My ex (22M) and I (20F) broke up a couple of days ago. It's the third time now in a span of less than a year. 

When we first strates dating/got back together those two times he would be all nice and caring, would give me enough attention would admire my ambitions and goals and assure that I'll get there. Then a month passes and the fights start. I'll explain our last two months together, because those are the times I recall the best, but previous times were very similar and had almost the same issues.

After a month or so being in a nice relationship he starts claiming that I don't do shit in uni even though we made an agreement that we'd both spend at least an hour a day studying even if we don't really need to have anything done. That wasn't a good enough proof to him that I'm taking my education seriously and that I'm putting effort into it. (Yes, he has a job in his field already, but his grades are not that good either)


He also starts claiming that I don't have any interests. When I prove to him that I have, he then says that they are childish (Art, world politics, other issues in the world). When I ask him to name his interests he says that that's not the point and that the point is that mine are childish. (I'd like to add that he was the one who took me to a museum five days ago and said that I didn't like it and I have no interest in life, because I was a bit fed up when he was reading a children's book for 15 minutes while we were in there)


He then goes round and round saying how important it is to talk everything out after a fight and fully resolve it, yet when he's done fighting he just shuts down and doesn't really talk about it, says he doesn't want to, says his head hurts so he just doesn't think about it. When I try to not think about a fight, he says that I'm running aeay from the problem, when he does it - it's just normal, because he doesn't want to feel worse. Only way to get him to talk is to ask him to meet up. I'd like to add that every shut down of his makes me go insane due to the previous breakups, I end up thinking that this means that he's leaving me again tomorrow, then I get massive anxiety, can't sleep or do anything else and he's fully aware of it. Sometimes he says that he feels horrible that he makes me feel this way, yet doesn't do anything to change it.


He says that I don't take my health seriously, because I don't fully follow keto (I have a glutten problem, so does he, and I try to avoid gluten products as much as I can), tho he doesn't follow keto himself, every fight is a good enough reason for him to shove his mouth full of bread.


Now I have difficulty understanding if this is actual abuse, the demands getting to the point of impossible, because every action I take to fulfil one of his demands goes unnoticed and if I try to point it out, then the action is dissmised. Claims that our views of the future doesn't allign, tho it perfectly did when we started talking again. Claims that I have no interests, tho I did a month ago. Claims that I have no hobbies, because I don't like physical activities (he doesn't do any of it either). 


When I'm writing this out it seems that the dude is at least a douchebag if he's not abusive, but 15 mins later I know I'll be questioning my judgement and wondering if there's actually something wrong with me.

So please, does this look like abuse to you and if it does, how can I cope with this, how can I fully understand it at all times so I don't end up idealising him again and thinking that I'm the piece of shit that's not enough here?",uaiuas,2019-02-08 07:52:37,4,702,7.45,41.55,58.07,21.4,30.52,11.82,95.01,62.54,23.36,14.53,7.26,1.14,0.14,5.84,0.14,8.83,5.27,9.97,12.11,7.83,9.4,3.7,21.08,4.27,2.56,1.85,1.28,2.71,6.27,2.99,3.28,0.43,1.57,0.28,11.97,0,0.14,0,5.84,13.25,2.99,2.14,2.28,3.13,1.42,3.99,2.42,0.57,1.28,0.85,1.42,0.71,0.43,0,0.28,8.4,1.85,1.57,2.42,2.42,0.85,3.7,16.67,1.42,16.1,1.85,5.84,8.55,1.57,0.71,0,0.14,0,0,1.28,0.43,0.43,0.14,0,0,16.24,2.99,4.84,0,0,0.28,0,0.14,0,5.84,1.99,0.14

aojdfp,Was I almost in a cult?,"Quick breakdown of events:
I had been in an online relationship with ""E"", that progressed to a real physical long distance relation ship. We visited each other approx 6 times over a whole year. The last time I was there he had treated me very strangely, and I was questioning his behaviour. When I returned home, he was suspiciously quiet online and barely talking to me. Two weeks later he is arrested for child sexual abuse.

His daughter was the one to contact me, and who made the claims. She said hewas a sick and horrible man and had to put a stop to him before I got hurt or my son. He eventually got in contact with me after he was released on bail. The whole situation is weird and fucked up. None of it made sense, and what both sides were telling me didn't add up. I decided to block all parties involved for my own mental health. The last straw was his daughter calling me at work, telling me that he has a new gf that looks exactly like me, and they needed to confirm I wasn't with him. Like, that just seemed WAY beyond appropriate behaviour for what was going on, plus I live thousands of miles away! Then he called me threatening to have me arrested because I'm a ""key witness"" but refused to have a lawer contact me! Every call, or message from either side was trying to lure me back there to ""prove"" something for them! Then two days ago, his daughter sends my Dad (who knows nothing about this) a huge message detailing everything, claiming I'm still with ""E"", sending him drugs and meeting with him! That my son is in danger! Of course, they knew my Dad would flip out, and he did, and threatened to kick me out, threatened to take my son away. Demanded go know WHY he was being sent this!

In the end, looking at everything, the whole situation has become very ""cult"" like. I've been gone for 4 months, and they are trying EVERYTHING to get me to come back. They have threatened to have me fired (lucky my boss know everything and they are ignoring calls about this), they have tried to lure me back in with jealousy, and now they are trying to use people in my own life against me! Why would a 16 year old girl, claiming to have been sexually abused by her father, be contacting MY father and telling him anything? And she even tried to do this with my mom! Not once has anyone tried to officially contact me by mail, which they ALL have my mailing address. They also have not tried to officially contact me by phone, it's always through some fake number messaging app. None of what I u derstand to be proper procedure has been followed, and makes me suspicious of everyone involved!

In the beginning, I 100% believed what I was told by his daughter because that's just something I would never doubt from a child! But then they started insisting that I was somehow involved, even though the incident she claimed happened YEARS before I met any of them! Not only that, but she didn't give me any info on investigators to talk to, lawyers or even her mom! If this was serious, why wasn't I being contacted or talked to by another adult! Then his ""mistresses"" started messaging me trying to convince me he was some sexually crazed psychopath. And these two women had lived with him for 11 years and 5 years, yet they witnessed nothing? They were off the hook, but my testimony was important? Trying to get me to contact investigators again. After all this, it just seemed so suspicious! Nothing was happening in any logical sensible way!

Anyways, I think I dodged getting sucked into a mini cult, especially how they are acting, trying to lure me back in. I was gonna be the 3rd woman, but I think he wanted me as the ""matriarch"" as the other two women were there to look after kids and be his personal assistant.

aol6ze,My story,"Growing up, my father was extremely angry. My first memory of abuse is when I had to watch him hit my mother's head against a brick wall and throw her down the stairs. I remember being locked inside a bathroom with her, her face dripping with blood and my father trying to break down the door to hurt her even more. Fast forward through the years my parents would fight but their fighting was abusive. The father would threatened my mother and tell her she is an idiot, a piece of shit, etc. He would scream and there would be no arguing with him. Anytime any of us did anything wrong we would yelled and told me could not do anything. If I so much as dropped a fork I would be screamed at. If I fell down, I would be told I'm an idiot. 

Even when I had friends come over my father would disapprove. Never would he show his real self when other people were around though. He'd always act like everything was perfect and we were a perfect little family. Recently I've started arguing with him more and more, I'm 25 keep in mind. My mother barely defends herself because she knows that it won't do anything. He doesn't hit anyone anymore. He told my mother he would ""leave her on the road to be a prostitute because she is an idiot"". That was the last straw and I snapped to which he threatened me. Eventually he cried and told me that it isn't that he doesn't love me. He still screams and yells from time to time.

On top of that, I am a short guy(I'm 5'2). In 5th grade I was thrown behind a door where I was spit on, kicked, called names and had the door slammed on my head. In 7th grade I was cornered in a bus and told I was a midget. When I tried to defend myself I was punched in the face. I have spent my whole life being told I am less than, pathetic, a midget, a hobbit, a dwarf. I feel so inadequate.

I am a very handsome person and a guitarist but I can't stand things anymore.

aomhd6,Was i sexually abused?,"Hello. So i have been reading about Rape Trauma Syndrome, and it has me worrying. Let me start of by saying that i have no  memory of being sexually abused, but i read that you could have blocked the memory, and i have 1 uncle who ive always strongly disliked, not feared, but disliked and not trusted. He always argued with my dad and he was bad with money, which caused lots of trouble, so that might be the reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Symptoms:

1: Bedwetting until the age of 12. I had a urinary tract infection some years earlier, which might be the cause.

2: Social anxiety and depression, begging in highschool around the age of 15.

3: Started watching pornography at age 12-13 and been trying to stop for 2 years now. (This addiction might explain a lot of the symptoms). I learned about porn and masturbation from a friend, FYI.

4: Stomach problems: My stomach was always bad, the anxiety made it worse, but my father and brother have similar issues.

5: Feeling uncomfortable when being touched. This stopped however when i got to know the people around me, then i became quite comfortable with it.

Other than that im a pretty regular kid, not quiet or anything, expect the anxiety makes it hard to talk.

One thing that happend in my childhood is being told by my 3 brothers that ""you can't come play with us"" pretty much everyday for years, which always has made me feel anoying and unwanted.",just-throw-me12,2019-02-08 15:25:51,0,258,37.04,33.49,69.33,1,16.12,18.99,92.25,51.94,17.44,9.69,7.75,0.39,0.78,0.78,0,7.75,5.04,10.47,10.08,3.88,7.75,1.94,19.77,3.88,1.55,2.33,5.04,1.55,9.69,2.33,7.36,2.33,1.55,0.39,8.53,1.94,0.39,0,2.71,17.44,3.49,2.33,1.55,4.65,1.94,4.26,2.71,0.39,0.78,1.55,5.43,1.16,1.94,2.33,0,8.91,2.33,0.39,2.71,0.39,3.49,6.98,8.53,1.94,10.85,0.39,1.94,8.53,1.16,0.39,0,0.78,0,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,18.99,5.81,6.2,2.71,0.78,0.39,0,0.39,0.78,0.39,0.78,0.78

aoo2dx,I don’t know how to feel about this.,"I’m at a point in my life at which I’m about to graduate and leave the house within about half a year, but my mom has been diagnosed with cancer.

I’m gonna cut to the chase—yet—it’s kinda complicated. My mother is a compulsive liar, a gossip machine, an alcoholic, somewhat of a skilled manipulator as well as one of those people who defend their families in a much more twisted kind of way, sort of like: “only I can treat my family like shit.” It’s fucked up.

Really, I’ve been sick of what she’s been doing for years. Though, when she told my family the news, I still couldn’t believe that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. I still can’t. I assume it isn’t that big of a deal since people don’t die easily because of that kind of cancer—at least where I live there’s been plenty of success stories, nevertheless... I think she’s  lying so I don’t leave the house because, trust me when I say that she even lies about the smallest things; then again, I feel as if this makes me a shitty person. I don’t even feel bad about it, knowing that she’s probably gonna die soon doesn’t affect me as much as it should and I think it’s because my relationship with her can’t be rekindled. Should I feel bad about this or should I get help?

After about 6 months of physical abuse I finally called the police on my boyfriend. He had bodyslammed me and busted my lip open. The police came, he was very calm and was arrested. I am sitting here now feeling every emotion imaginable but the biggest one is-regret. I'm feeling regretful and guilty that my bf is in jail because of me. The officers kept saying to stop saying that and that he is in jail because of HIS actions. Even though my lip is bleeding and swollen and I have bruises etc I just want my bf here with me. After the abuse he always holds me and makes me feel better and now I don't have that and I am left feeling completely alone and empty.

aoqivt,how do i move on?,"i dated this guy last year i met through a friend of mine. i wasn’t exactly open to the idea at first as he was very pushy and forced me to do a lot of things id consider out of my comfort zone. and normally i can say no but he was so persistent and played the “oh so you hate me” card whenever i refused to go out with him or do what he wanted. anyway, we started dating and he was so happy about it and i guess all that mattered to me was his happiness.
im the type of guy (yes i am gay) who puts other peoples feelings and happiness before his own. its a habit. 
so time goes on and he starts changing. he dragged me into his drama. caught feelings for other people while with me. i felt trapped and alone since i couldnt leave due to the fact he knew shit about me and would surely tell someone if i left. which he later did. i was also afraid he’d do something to hurt himself if i left. he’d post graphic pictures captioning “if you leave i dont think ill be able to go on anymore..” stuff like that which had me terrified and stuck with someone i didnt love, let alone like and couldnt leave.
he fucked with my head. made all his problems priority and when it came to mine told me i was being stupid and needed to just stop. he would constantly invalidate my existence. tell his friends to come after me and send me death threats after i got mad about him being his usual insensitive self. i tried so hard to be a good person for him. after struggling with addiction and depressive thoughts for months. i still tried to push it aside and be a good person for him.
he would tell me i made him so happy, then the next minute we’d be fighting about something. then it got to the point where i couldnt take it anymore and wanted to just end it all. but after meeting my now best friend. i felt around 5% better. 
then he left. he started dating a girl. he told me he didnt have feelings for her. but then basically told me he was done with me. and that left me broken. of course, i tried to move on. i stopped drinking and tried to surround myself with happier things. but now. for the past month. its all been hitting me. the abuse. the lies. the distrust i had for him. everything.

i dont know how to move on and forget. its not easy. i cant express how im feeling to anyone in my life because they don’t understand. they feel sorry for me and reassure me that things will turn out okay. but they wont if im laying awake all night feeling absolutely numb from what HE did. i dont mean to sound petty or annoying, i just dont know where else to go.

so please. someone. help me.

aos9um,Narcissistic parents,"My mother and stepfather  are controls freaks. They always have been, but since 4 years ago it's been getting worse. Not to mention what I now understand is blatant narcissism. I think it'll be easier for me to simply list off the shit they've done to me. 

-3 or so years ago, stepfather has sent me messages (creepy, flirty messages) from a different number to make me think I had a stalker. After enjoying how freaked out I was and toying with me for several hours, my siblings, who also was in on it (and are just as shitty for even helping,) gave it up when they finally realized how scared I was. When I confronted him, he threatened to fuck me up for daring to raise my voice at him and diverted the blame to my siblings. It was his idea. He never apologized for that. The duck me up part where his EXACT WORDS. 

-After having enough of it, I attempted to leave only to be forced to stay and getting ""kicked out"" (which didn't really happen. They sent me to my grandmother's house so they still had control over the situation.) after making a rather big deal about being pissed I tried to leave them. This was a month or so ago. 

-Have blatantly told me, several times, that I'M the problem and that there's something wrong with me. I'm constantly being told that the way I think, act, that my mindset is a problem, particularly when I disagree with them. 

-They have lied to family members about me, saying that I'm mentally unstable and ostracizing me. 

-They have taken my phone and laptop. I was homeless for a while and while I was they read the messages my WORRIED FRIENDS sent me, naming them think I was active online and ignoring, despite the fact that I warned them that I war homeless and wouldn't have internet access. 

-Constantly, CONSTANTLY compare me to my siblings. ""look at how well your sister is doing,"" ""Your little brother is so smart, he's destined for great things."" Needless to say, it used to make me feel like absolute garbage. 

-Hypocrisy. When my brother was kicked out after a fistfight, my mother cried and argued for him to let my brother back for 6 god damned months straight. When I left with what I could they ransacked my room and used my stuff. How lovely.

-My little brother, and my stepfather's only kid, gets spoiled rotten and I often have to give him what he wants.  I clean his room, make his dinner when he's too lazy to. He. IS. 13 YEARS OLD.  In fact, despite the fact that I too have a job, I'm often doing the most cleaning and cooking. 

That's not nearly all of it. They're always looking for a reason to tell at me or keep me in the house. They even took my house keys. I was stuck inside for over a month until now. They also made me sleep in the freezing basement, and nearly forced me to pay a fake 300 dollar bill for no other reason than to teach me a lesson. I hate them and I have every god damn right to. I resent them, and at this point if either of them died I wouldn't she'd a single tear.

aoz0j1,Sexually abused as a child,"I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for by posting this, just to vent I guess. I was sexually abused by my cousin when I was around 6, he would have been a teenager. I think it only happened once but I'm not sure. I'm 28 now and ever since I had my daughter (a year ago) I've been really struggling with it. You see I'm not 100% sure it was my cousin who did it, but he sexually abused my older sister around the same time so it makes sense to me that it was most likely him. When I was young I would have these flashbacks of what happened but I didn't really understand at the time. I didn't tell my mom what happened until I was 16 and that's when I found out about my sister. The worst part is nothing ever happened to him. My sister and I still have to sometimes see him at family events and we have to all just pretended like nothing happened. Which I think has really messed me up over the years. And ever since having my daughter I just can't deal with it anymore. The thought of someone doing that to her or any child is just debilitating. He also is married now and has an 8 year old son. I worry that he might be abusing him as well but I have no proof of that nor have I seen anything that would lead me to that. My cousin was abused by his uncle when he was little, who was also abused and so on. I worry that this will just keep going down the family line as it just seems to be swept under the rug. I've also been having intimacy issues with my husband for years and we are currently trying to work on it and will be going to a psychologist. I guess I'm just feeling frustrated and helpless. The abuse happened so long ago but still has this control over me. I've struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life. And he just gets to live his life with no consequences. But I can't even report it if I'm not 100% sure it was him and it was so long ago. I think having my daughter made me have to relive what happened to me and how badly I want to protect her from abuse. The sad part is there isn't a woman I know who wasn't abused at some point in her life.",Thegreatestshowis,2019-02-09 17:03:47,2,425,4.51,16.73,83.41,1,17,10.35,95.76,67.06,24.71,16.47,12,0.47,0.24,3.76,0,8.24,3.53,11.76,13.88,8.71,9.18,3.53,21.88,2.12,1.88,3.06,1.65,1.65,5.88,1.18,4.71,1.18,2.35,0.71,10.35,3.76,0,2.59,3.76,16,2.59,1.88,1.18,3.29,2.82,5.18,1.41,0.94,0,0.24,1.65,0,0.94,0.71,0,7.29,2.82,0.71,3.06,0.24,0.71,7.53,12.71,1.18,12,0.71,4.24,7.06,0.94,0.47,0.71,0,0,0,0.24,0,0,0,0.24,0,11.53,5.65,0.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0.47,0.47

I mentioned to my manager as I was doing my closing duties that the trash cans do have some trash, but I think we shouldn’t change it yet because there’s only a little bit.

He really knew how to make us feel completely incompetent and like completely stupid. Every time someone says that to me, I get this burning rage inside. My managers comment didn’t make me angry, but it did make me think of how he used to say shitty things like that.. Which angers me all over again.

ap1ev3,I am struggling with my victim impact statement. Please help.,"I've written several and none feel ""right"". I tried contacting the victim witness unit, court advocate from a domestic violence group, and DA victim advocate but absolutely nobody has answered. 

I need to write my victim impact statement for a hearing for assualt. I was abused for several years and some people have told me I need to include that in my impact statement as well as his emotional abuse of the children. None of his history of abuse against me or previous significant other was ever reported. 

I've read that my statement should only state how the specific crime being convicted has affected my life and I should not mention his history of abuse. 

Somebody please help me figure out how to write this thing. My mind literally races nonstop already from PTSD and this is just adding to the pile of constant stewing going on in my brain. I don't even know where to begin and I don't want to end up looking as insane as this ordeal has made me feel. I just feel so alone, afraid and confused by this entire process. 

Thank you to anybody that is able to give me some insight. 

Also, yes I am working with a therapist but while she has experience working with trauma from domestic violence she doesn't have a background in how the court system works or what the judge is looking for.

Also I understand that this story isn't nearly as bad as others but I could still use some advice, and I have gone to teachers about this before but all have pretty much ignored me just giving me a magnet for kids helpline (a phone number for kids with normally school issues)



Now to clarify and expain, my step father verbally abuses my sister, my mother and me. It's been happening for well over 5 years and sometimes he even hits my mother. I have confronted my mother but she always says 'its normal' and 'he will stop eventually' I'm thirteen about to be fourteen and my dad lives on the other side of the world (I live in Australia he lives in England) I also have a lot of problems with controlling my anger, in the sense of that I don't always immediately do something and let it build up until I do something that could get someone hurt. My real father and I are in really good contact and call often for up to 2 hours. I have always been taught since I was little never to hurt a woman no matter the case, unless they are literally holding a gun to your head, and even then I have been told to act with care. So when he does these things to my mum and sister it really get me anger, to the point where for the last year or 2 I have been thinking and sometimes writing down ways to kill myself or him. I am really scared one day I will go through with it. I have tried to self harm on a few accasions. I think it would be better if I went to live with my dad, but my mum won't allow it, she always says she doesn't mind if I leave but when ever I try to leave she makes up a heap of bullshit and normally starts using drugs to deal with the stress (her and my step dad are big time drug users, and my step dad is a small time drug dealer) what should I do?",Cheekysharky06,2019-02-10 00:34:50,2,369,24.47,25.76,88.43,4.16,33.55,8.94,92.68,60.98,20.33,14.63,11.38,0,0.27,2.71,0.27,5.69,4.07,13.55,10.3,6.78,9.21,1.63,18.16,2.44,1.08,1.08,2.17,1.36,5.42,1.63,3.79,0.54,1.63,0.54,10.84,3.79,0.27,3.52,3.25,14.09,1.36,1.63,2.44,4.07,1.9,4.34,1.63,0,0.81,0.54,2.17,0.27,1.9,0,0,6.5,0.54,1.36,2.98,1.08,0.81,2.98,12.2,1.36,16.26,2.17,5.15,8.67,1.08,0.27,0,0,0,0.27,1.08,0.27,0.54,0,0.27,0,10.84,3.25,2.98,0,0,0.27,0,0,0,2.71,1.63,0
ap7dyf,How Anger Can Force You To Forge A Much Better Happier Life Ahead,"For anyone that's living with emotionally/physically/Mentally abusive partners/parents I'm going to tell how to rise above it and keep moving to get out sooner. Now all of you have different scenarios so it may/may not to all of you, but this is from my own experience.

My mom drinks heavily each day (there's never a day she's sober) and rages loudly every other day. She had hit &amp; slapped me (while I was an adult), scratched my arms, spat on my father and I before on our heads, called my brother , father and I ""queers"" , threatened me, would lock doors on me in the cold morning after taking my dad to work because I didn't have a car, would destroy my father's property and completely burn his furniture and ripped it up into tiny pieces and even would yell at me through my bedroom door so that I couldn't sleep for 20+ hours in the past, she would burn random things outside at 4 am, and just overall very unstable to live with. 


Now most of that treatment has stopped happening to me but I realize I can't stay at that house any longer than I financially can. 

While the emotional  abuse was really bad that's not the worst part. The worst part is the normalising behavior that my father has for her. He complains about her and argues with her drunken abusive behavior almost daily but then just a few hours later they're watching tv together and acting like nothing ever happened. They'd have big dinners just hours after her behavior, and she would make food each time. 

Then when I could no longer take this strange behavior it made me so puzzled and angry. Now I've gotten so angry I've finally done something about it! I'm applying to a second job to utilize my time more efficiently and make a lot more money than I'm currently. 

My thoughts were this: why can't I have a normal consistent peaceful happy day ? Why am I still living with this? I can only help myself since govt services won't help then I need another job! I need to stop having a victim mentality (after I get out of the house due to their treatment), I need to take care better care of myself and not waste my time with parents who don't care about me and my important life decisions/milestones, I need to find friends, I need to earn enough for an apartment, I need to look for these abusive/toxic red flags in a possible future girlfriend/lover.


Only few YouTube videos helped me out with abuse and how to handle it. The ones that stuck with me were the ones that said you have to get angry enough to finally say enough is enough &amp; I don't need these people in my life anymore &amp; I need to change this situation on my own no matter how hard it is going to be.

ap89la,Was this sexual abuse?,"Made a throwaway for this one. So, so sorry it's this long, I haven't written this all out before. 

I'm 31 and female, I was around 14 possibly just 15, so this was around 2002-ish, I'm not exactly sure. 
One of my mum's friends knew a woman (Michelle) who was looking for a babysitter for her kids who were around 6 and 4, every now and again on a Friday night. My mum's friend mentioned this to me as I'd met Michelle at a christening briefly and she had asked her specifically to find out if I'd do it. She told me Michelle and her boyfriend (not her kids dad) would pay me £40, pick me up from home and drop me back in the morning. They needed a sitter so they could go out for drinks as they never got any time alone as the kids real dad wasn't on the scene for whatever reason. Obviously I said yes because of the money, £40 was a lot to a teen and I had nothing else to do so I was happy to do it. 

So the first time to go round comes, and the couple (both early 30s) come to get me and take me to theirs, Michelle and my mum had a quick chat and it all seemed fine so off we went. On the way there they asked me if I smoked (which was a bit odd thinking back but I just thought this couple were super cool), I lied and said no then Michelle pulls a 20 pack out of her bag laughing and says ""well you won't want these then will you?"", obviously I took them but asked them not to tell my mum's friend and they assured me they wouldn't.

We get to the house and as soon as you walked in the living room, the smell of weed hit you and there was a huge, and I mean massive, poster of a characature of the Queen smoking a joint pinned over the fireplace. I thought to myself that was pretty fucking weird when they have kids living there, but again I just thought they were the coolest adults ever. The kids seem really nice and about 10 minutes after we arrived at theirs, they headed off out to the pub. They tell me i can use their phone to ring whoever I want when the kids fall asleep, but to make sure its a landline. This was when mobile phones were just becoming a big thing and I was never allowed to use the phone at home so I was thrilled. 

Immediately after they leave the 6 year old girl drags me to the kitchen to the bread bin and opens it showing me tons of small brownies wrapped in cling film, maybe about 20 of them. She tells me these are her mums boyfriends 'naughty cakes' and if we eat any of them we will get a smack, I thought this was a seriously fucked up conversation to be having with a 6 year old so I told her to close the bin and come watch tv. The kids fall asleep earlyish and I spend the next few hours on the phone to whoever would answer. Michelle and her boyfriend return early hours and pass me watching TV on the sofa (where I slept), after a brief couple of minute chat they went to bed. They took me home after breakfast the next day.

They ask me to sit again maybe a month later and obviously I say il do it due to the money, cigarettes and free phone. Everything is fine the next few times I go round and follows the pattern above pretty closely. The fourth time I go over the same again, they go out then come home later and straight to bed. I'm asleep on the couch (on my front, fully clothed) a couple of hours after they got home when I wake up feeling a massive pressure on my back and vague rubbing on my face. I remember so clearly thinking what the actual fuck is happening and trying to work it out whilst coming round. The TV is on, about 10ft away, but the room is pitch black otherwise so I can hardly see. I reached behind my head to whatever was touching my face and felt the stubble of Michelle's boyfriends beard and tried to get up from under him. I'm more or less full panic attack at this point and my dressing gown I was wearing is stuck underneath this man now. When I pull it free I turn around to look at him and he is fully naked with an erection and he is showing it to me but his eyes are closed the whole time.

I ran upstairs to the kids room and got in the daughters bed with her, I remember I reasoned that it was the safest option. A moment later I hear Michelle come from her own bedroom and run downstairs where naked pervo still was. Muffled screaming ensures for a few minutes and I hear them coming back up the stairs to their room and Michelle is repeating over and over to boyfriend: ""you have ruined it now."" I lie there trying to be silent and luckily they don't come into the kids room. At this point it is about 4am and I lie there terrified until 6am when I sneak out of the house and call a taxi from the local supermarkets phone and using my earnings to pay for it.

Obviously I never hear from them again and I tell a few of my friends about what happened, but never tell my parents as my dad was the kind of man who would have beat the shit out of the guy rather than call the police. I thought my dad would get in trouble and also I was just so confused about what happened. I reasoned for the next 10 years that  Michelles bf was sleepwalking after loads of alcohol and didn't actually intend to scare me.

The past 6 years or so I have started to think about this event on a very regular basis. I'm breathing quite heavily just from writing it down. I have kids of my own now and I have been feeling really really guilty lately for not telling an adult about what happened at the house, it is eating me alive that I may have been able to stop the kids being abused in one way or another by those people if I'd spoken up. I don't remember the boyfriends name at all, Michelles surname or exactly which house it was they lived at if I were to do something at this late stage. Was I sexually abused or was this just a messed up accident? The fact they were giving me loads of things like cigs etc makes me wonder if they were grooming me? What did Michelle mean by ruined it?

Thank you so much for reading.

apcmka,I need help (child sex abuse),"Hello, I need some help with my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I was about 3-5, I don't remember, when I was molested by two different people. Everything is incredibly blurry. I barely remember anything that happened, but thinking of it makes me incredibly disturbed and antsy. I'm 15 now.

When I was about 6 I showed my cousin who is 8 months younger than me what certain things were. I didn't know that was wrong. I didn't know that you weren't supposed to do those kinds of things. I wanted to be her big sister and teach her things. In my head, I was helping her.

I feel disgusting. Obviously that kind of thing stopped very quickly when we were around 8, and I had forgotten about it until recently. Because I was abused, I abused her, too. I hate abusers, I hate people who molest other people, rapists, I hate all of them. I don't know if she remembers, but she probably does considering she barely talks to me and acts weird around me.

I don't know how to tell her I'm sorry, I was abused and I didn't know I was doing something wrong. It's hard enough dealing with the trauma from being abused myself but I also feel like a fucking dumbass for not seeing that what was happening was wrong, I'm a dumbass for not realizing what I did to her was also wrong, I'm a dumbass for not telling anyone in the first place.

I'm at her house right now, things at my house have been pretty rough and I had to get out of there. I've been here for a little over a week and we've spoken *twice.* We used to talk all the time and be best friends. I feel like it's because of all of this, she must remember too, she hates me. I don't even know what I'm going on about anymore. I don't know, I don't know.

Am I a disgusting person? Do I deserve to even apologize or speak about this on this subreddit? Please someone just talk to me, I'm confused, I'm disgusted by everything and I hate myself.",throwaway443_,2019-02-10 20:41:50,1,366,4.07,13.13,88.3,1,14.08,13.66,95.36,63.93,28.42,19.67,15.03,0.82,0.27,3.28,0.27,8.74,2.46,11.75,14.21,7.1,6.28,3.55,25.68,4.1,1.91,2.73,2.46,1.09,9.56,1.37,8.2,0.55,4.37,0.27,11.75,0.55,0.27,3.55,0,17.21,4.92,1.37,1.37,4.1,2.19,4.37,2.46,0.55,0.55,1.37,1.09,0.27,0,0.82,0,6.01,2.46,0.55,2.19,0.55,1.37,9.56,14.48,0.27,8.47,0.55,3.83,4.37,0.27,0.27,0.55,0,0,0,1.09,1.09,0,0,0,0,21.31,6.56,5.74,0,0.55,0.55,0,0.27,0,6.01,0.55,1.09
apdmge,Need advice on handling abusive situation.,"So, I have an abusive older sister. She is 29 years old, has been abusive for my entire life, and in her chaos has essentially destroyed my family. She has an INCREDIBLY good job (started her own recruiting firm in a big city I will not name) and makes a lot of money that she spends on excessive shopping, multiple luxury gym memberships, regular SoulCycle and yoga classes, etc. She still lives with my parents for some reason, claiming it to be financial. I do not really know why. She commutes to the city for work.

My father has always refused to kick her out because “his kids ALWAYS have a place with him” so even when I was in high school and my therapists would insist that he needed to remove her from our home in order for me to be a healthy, functional student and person... he refused. I graduated college and have mostly been living at home since, working a job in my field and putting a lot of my income into savings so that I can move to the city. When I am not working, I travel out of state to visit my long-distance partner so I am not always here. 

She has always been emotionally and verbally abusive, with a general violent tinge (throwing things, destroying belongings, hitting, etc) to both me and my mother. In recent months I have been successful in “cutting her off” essentially, even avoiding speaking to her on her birthday, and I’m proud because I usually get threatened into communicating with her again. 

About a month ago, she was going on an abusive rampage... and I took a video of it. She saw me filming it and jumped me. I have footage of that happening and photos of the marks left on my arms from her attack. That’s what triggered me cutting her off. So... tonight, she was losing her mind again. She was being cruel to my mother and I said, “hey, don’t speak to her like that” and long story short, she lost it. Started off with her telling me to shut up and leave her alone, but eventually escalated into shrieking and screaming about how *I’m* the terrible daughter, how I’m a loser, how I just wanted to pick a fight, how I’m a waste of space, that my job is fake (?), racist comments about my boyfriend, that I’m a “worthless piece of shit.” I sleep on the couch because she was given my bed. She decided she was going to sleep there instead and I told her no, not because I wouldn’t like my bed back, but because she doesn’t get to just tell me what to do and where to do. She didn’t like that, and she said something about how “the living room and dining room are for everyone” and how she will “make sure I see that” and proceeded to do yoga with music, chop vegetables, slam drawers, etc, very clearly trying to upset me. I wept but I didn’t retaliate. My mom asked her to stop and she flipped again, going on a similar tirade... so I filmed it again. She jumped me again. Hurled so much verbal abuse that I can hardly remember it all. My dad is spineless and an enabler and even he got in my face, told me I deserved to get attacked because I had the audacity to film her, and called me a worthless piece of shit. And then he told me to leave, and also told me to never speak to him again because I told him to get out of my face and not to yell at me like that.

So... at some point during this, I said something to my sister like “I wish I could just stab you” or something wild. I was being abused and screamed at and I have PTSD so I was basically in a haze of panic and loss of control... so yeah, I said something a little wild. But I didn’t do anything other than make that comment. I said I wanted to go to the police about her with all my evidence and she keeps saying she’ll tell them I “threatened her with a knife” if I do. She then said she would sue me and run me into the ground.

I feel sad, stuck, and scared. I feel like I cannot report my abuse now because she has so many threats hanging over me. Part of me knows that my comment is nothing compared to actual violence and abuse she had inflicted on me, but I’m still... scared that reporting will just backfire and I’ll get sued or the police won’t help. I just really, really need advice from people who have an outsider’s perspective. Please help. I need to know if I can help my mother and I have safe lives. Any insight welcome.

apf7hv,Just need to talk.,"I'm not sure what the best subreddit is for this. 

I feel like I'm losing my head the past week or two. I have a history of being in narcissistic and abusive relationships and I'm very confused right now whether I'm in another currently. I have no idea whether im being gaslit right now. I have no idea if I'm wrong right now. I feel confused. 

I haven't felt like being mean to myself in about 2 years but the last 3 or 4 times I've slept over here, I've felt like being mean to myself. I've felt like cutting my legs (I haven't though), I've had glimpses of suicidal thoughts, and right now I'm feeling like rolling over and being a pushover and letting him be mean to me. Completely submitting. I feel like going back to one of my abusive exs because i feel hopeless. I feel like I might deserve it. I feel like it wont get any better than this. 

I thought i grew and was healthy again and would never be in another abusive relationship. I thought i was normal now. But now i think that was all a sham and i will never be normal or good enough to be in a real healthy relationship  

I'll never find someone who can be patient with the scars I have. I am calm, and kind. But it doesnt matter. I'm still wrong. And it warrents anger and aggression. 

I am broken and will always be in dysfunctional romantic relationships. Even if I think I have gotten better, I probably haven't.

apgndc,My discovery (long),"I'm not really sure how most of you came to the realization that you were in an abusive relationship. For me, my two year on and off relationship was just a ""bad"" one with someone who ""likes to fight"" a lot. Constant breakups and makeups. There were honeymoon periods that would get shorter and shorter until they all but disappeared. My friends all hated her, and I understood why, but I felt what I thought was love and just wanted to support and help her. I mean, if I show her enough love she'll change, right?

I finally got tired of how she was treating and talking to me, so I broke up with her and she moved out. I missed her horribly and reached out a few times only to be completely ignored. As the months passed things got better and I finally accepted that we'd never be together and that I'd likely never talk to her again.

Fast forward to a few days ago when I get a drunk text out of the blue asking if she can see me. It was a text that I had wanted and had given up hope of ever receiving, so of course I said yes. She came over and she told me all about her new relationship (that she just ended) over wine. She kissed me a few times, too. It was such a weird feeling, knowing that she was toxic and it was a bad idea, but trying to figure out how I'd explain her being back in my life to my friends. I didn't know if we'd date but I held out hope for a friendship.

She ended up spending the night and when we woke up the next morning it started up again. The little insults and one liners came fast and furious. Nothing ever enough to make you be offended, but enough to erode my confidence. We began talking about our failed relationship and I mentioned things that I would have done differently, such as enforcing boundaries, and she matter of factly explained that all it would have done was cause a fight. I even had been afraid to say what I would have done since I didn't want to ruin a chance at a friendship.

The key was when I asked her ""why did you reach out"" and I got ""Do you want the real answer or the nice one? The real answer is that I was drunk."" That just crushed me, and it all fell into place. What I had explained away as her own shitty behavior because of unresolved abuse in her life was actually a carefully planned tactic of wearing me down over the years to make herself feel better. I realized that the decrease in my self confidence over the last few years coincided exactly with when we first met.

I was supposed to be a one night stand that ended up showing her kindness and affection that she hadn't expected, and as a result it clued her in that I would make a really, really great victim. So I got love bombed, ignored, discarded, then bombed again, etc. The insidious thing about this person is that she herself is a therapist who deals with victims of abuse and I think her knowing exactly how abuse works made her especially good at it.

I won't lie and say that I don't feel something for her. I feel love for the picture of an imperfect and troubled woman that my mind had made. I want to say that I feel pity for the person who she really is, but I'm really not sure. I know I really mourn the relationship that I imaged that we had. I've been reading books and watching Youtube videos about surviving emotional abuse and a few things really resonated with me:

* Nothing I could have done, no amount of love I showed would have changed the situation. When we first met I really wanted to ""fix"" her problems, which I realized was just unhealthy. But I thought that being a perfect supportive boyfriend would be enough. No, it never would have been.

* Abuse like this is deliberate. It's planned. It's intentional. It's not just compatibility, it's not just how things play out. No, everything that happened was designed to break me and give her power over me. Way back in the day I mentioned how it always seemed like she looked down on me and that was dismissed with a ""No, that's crazy."" I accepted it, but still felt uneasy. And it didn't change.

* It escalates. The last fight we had she shoved me, and I realized that if I had stayed she would have kept getting madder and madder and physical violence would have become a thing.

* There is a reason why she isn't in therapy, or why she's fired every therapist she's had. It's because she doesn't want to change and confront her own demons. Maybe confronting them wouldn't be enough to stop her from being an abuser, but at least as a therapist it's important to self-care in ways other than abusing casual sex and alcohol. 

* It wasn't my fault for not leaving sooner. Okay, I'll admit I'm really struggling with this right now because I've always thought that I was strong and had my stuff together, and it's scary to think that someone could show up and I'd willingly let her tear me down for so long. (I knew the relationship was bad from nearly the start.)

* Discarding your victim is probably one of the cruelest acts that an abuser does. And them coming back for a quick drive by is designed to keep you on the hook but far enough away where you don't feel any imagined comfort by their presence. 

Anyway this was probably longer than I had wanted it to be but I wanted to put it out there and, while I didn't go into great detail, I hope maybe something here resonated with someone going through what I am right now.

It's sad. I miss her, I love her. But I finally love myself more.

apgy2e,So how can you tell when you've begun to create healthy friendships?,"I'm a bit jumpy. I've always had this discomfort in my ribcage to the point that I feel I can't breathe most of the time when I'm with others. I do not often know how to express that I am overwhelmed, but I am developing the capability to discern.  

So, I'm wondering. . . . . . Now that I'm supposed to be able to form healthier connections where I don't necessarily have to feel like I can't breathe, how can I tell what these friendships are like? I expect that any social connection would require compromise &amp; the occasional disagreement. 

How would you describe the turning point for you in realising your relationships had become healthy. Could you please describe that?

apjbiq,Was it abuse?,"My ex, H and I were together for nearly 4 years, and during that time, I became a perfect little doormat. He never hit me, never raised his voice towards me, and never said terrible/stereotypically abusive things to me. But I became a different person around him.

It was recently pointed out to me that this could have been a kind of abuse, but I have no idea if that's true.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I met H, I loved hanging out with my friends, playing video games with them, D&amp;D and other nerdy things. We would sometimes go out as one big group for dinner, or we'd spend 'Pre-Christmas' with each other (we weren't going to see each other over christmas so we met up the week before for a mini-christmas just between us). Afterwards, I didn't see them as often. Yes, I had a bf that I wanted to spend time with, I thought it was obvious that we might not see each other all the time like we used to. 

After 4 years though, I didn't know anything about my friends anymore. I never saw them, never talked to them, never even knew that one of them got married! It was only H and me, in our own little bubble.

I looked after him too. I was the only one working, so I would buy our food and drinks. I did his laundry. I cleaned his house. I ran errands for him.

My mother started to question me about my behaviour, and even once said she didn't know who I was anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

After I broke up with him, because I was starting to suspect his temper would turn towards me, stuff with him and his family got really crazy ((for post about that see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/aph58m/crosspost\_from\_rbreakingmom\_why\_does\_protecting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/aph58m/crosspost_from_rbreakingmom_why_does_protecting/) )

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm in a new relationship, I've made new friends, I feel like a normal human being again, and when I mentioned all this to a friend, they said it sounded like abuse without the violence. But was it really? I'm nothing like that in my new relationship. And I was never like that in any relationship before H, so I really have no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for advice really, hope someone can give me some pointers.

aporc4,How Do You Heal?,"Without going into a lot of detail, I'm a 35 year old woman. From the ages of 5 to 11, I was molested by two uncles, and my biological father. At his hands I was also the target of a lot of physical and mental abuse. 

Yes, I told my mom. And yes, I was ignored. Until I was 11, she left and realized believing me was good payback for the years of abuse *she* suffered. To this day, I don't think she believes me, and if she does she clearly doesn't care.

So, im trying to finally work through some of the issues in therapy, and it has led me to wonder how on earth *anyone* ever moves on from this. 

For a long time I just ignored it, even though it's affected every aspect of who I am. But it's toxic. Ignoring it just turned it into a cancer that won't let go. So I'm trying to come to terms with it. I just don't know how. 

My therapist recommended something called EFT Tapping, which I've attempted with little success. Once I got past feeling absolutely ridiculous, I'm left an absolute mess, struggling to find my feet again so I can squash it all back down inside. I know it's not healthy and I know it's defeating the purpose, but it's so... damn... hard. 

I just want to move on. I don't want this to control my life anymore, it's done that for far too long. But I truly feel trapped in this ball of emotional chaos that goes crazy when I try to acknowledge what happened so I can move forward.

apte8p,My abusive ex (31f) has moved back and I'm (36m) terrified of the havoc she may wreak,"I've never shared here, because I've never really had problems like this one. But now, I'm looking for feedback, and I'll scroll through and see if I've got any helpful advice to deliver.  That said, bear w me, I'm gonna try to condense 10-11 years into an explanation for how a 4'7, 98 pound chick has a 6'5, 220 pound dude so shook.

I met her when she was 18, and I had just gotten back from overseas. I'm a combat veteran, and I was injured. When I met her, I was still using a wheelchair to get around. I was 23.

When I met her at a party, I actually thought my mind had snapped. I had heard about dudes breaking from the stress overseas, and when she turned around, I thought she was a ghost. There had been a civilian who died, a female, whom I felt personally responsible for, and my ex, when I first saw her; looked so similar I thought I was seeing things. I didn't even address her. I was afraid that no one else could see her. So I didn't acknowledge her, I hung out w my friends, and I glanced at her from across the room a few times. She remained seated, watching tv from the floor.

Finally, someone introduced us, and I felt this huge rush of relief, that she wasn't the ghost of a dead girl, or an image burnt into a broken mind. We talked, she had a boyfriend, so I backed off. Then, one day, her cousin, who happened to be a good friend of mine, called me up and told me his cousin (I didn't know their relation at the time, so I didnt know who he was talkin' about) was being abused by her bf, and asked if I could provide him some back up to go get her out of the house. I agreed. I was surprised to find out it was the same girl from the party. Somethin' about her needing me in that moment made me connect her to the girl from overseas whom I had helplessly watched die. This was my second chance, I had thought, my second chance to save the girl from overseas. So I barreled forward, and to breeze past the finer details, dealt w her (now) ex boyfriend, and made certain she was safely escorted to her ma's house.

Within a few days she and I were dating. I don't remember who made the leap and asked to be dating, but if I had to guess; I'd say it was me. I was utterly smitten w her, and I was healing. I associated my rise from wheelchair to a walker, and a walker to a cane w dating her. Despite the fact that by the time I had helped her escape her ex bf, I was already walking w a cane. I made up this sort of fantasy wo ever really knowing I had done it. I was able to make sense of the girl from overseas dying, by convincing myself the universe delivered a second chance, and everything sorta played into that fantasy. My health and recovery. Her happiness. It was all to save this other chick who had died.

Anyway... fast forward a couple years, and we were engaged. I noted that she had a tendency to fly off the handle, but she was younger than me, so I dealt w it by just weathering the storm, and keeping my head down. Then, 3 years in, 1 year engaged, she cheated. I had told her that was my line when we first started dating. The one thing I couldn't forgive was cheating. I took her aside when the dude she cheated w cried to me in my car, cuz he thought I was gonna throw him a beatin'. I didn't, mostly because I didnt believe him. So I took her aside, away from our first son, and spoke calmly and plainly. I told her I knew she cheated and I specifically said, ""I believe you kissed him, but I know you're not a whore, I know you didnt just fuck him on the side of the road..."" at which point she cut me off, crying, and told me ""I am a whore that fucked him on the side of the road."" Turns out.. she literally did that, which sucked, but I told her then, ""I wont be able to forgive this dude, but you're a good person and a good ma, don't let this make you question that, or allow it to reflect on your parenting.""

That shoulda been it. But I adored her. She swore she cheated cuz she thought I was gonna leave her, and she had a childhood filled w sexual assault. She thought I'd leave because I had reconnected w an old friend that hated her. She made a lot of assumptions from there. But I believed her, I WANTED to believe her, and I forgave her. We stayed together, moved, and things actually sorta got better. She was much more passionate about her love for me, and I returned that passion. We spent another 4 years together (7 total at this point) before she cheated again... and for the same reasons.

Now, its important to note, I'm no angel. I have ptsd, and thoughts that race and leave me sorta ... difficult to deal with. Im not a monster, but when my thoughts race I have a hard time communicating. It makes it seem like Im heartless, cold, or I guess like a monster. Not because im aggressive, but because I sorta shutdown and pull away. I guess I seem distant. When she cheated again, I didn't have another kind, understanding speech for her. I was hurt. I left her. Moved out, cut off communication. For the briefest moments, I stopped connecting her to the girl from overseas. She was just a girl from my hometown, and my hometown is notorious for trashy behavior... lots of trailer parks and projects smashed together in a town which experienced a population spike from 28k to 60k in just shy of 5 years.

Anywho, she wielded my son against me like a weapon. He's not mine, biologically. I've been his dad ever since he called me that when he was 3. I met him the day he turned 2, though, and I've considered him mine ever since. So does he, so does she. But when I left, she wanted me back, and refused to let me see my son unless I agreed to at least talk w her and consider getting back together. During this time, she started a weird campaign of convincing me that I'm wrong in the head. Now, granted, there ARE legitimate claims supporting that, in general. I have ptsd, I have a traumatic brain injury that caused a change in some of my personality. But unless you knew me as a kid, you wouldn't recognize the change caused by the brain injury. It just made me sorta... hermity. Im not an extrovert anymore, and things seem to matter more to me, than they used to, insults, compliments, politics, generalizations. I dunno, but I own a home, entirely paid off, I own 4 vehicles, all paid off, I raise my sons as a single father just fine, and they both do well in school... so I mean.. problems, but not a crazy person that can't fit in society, I don't think.

But she would insert little false memories... she'd change history while we talked, and I'd allow it because she'd brush off my contention by saying, ""dude, you're just not remembering, have you taken your meds today? Maybe you're just having a hard time remembering because its time to visit the doc"" .. yknow.. nothing abrasive, but clearly asserting I'm not viewing reality as is. And I fell for that... it excused her cheating.. sure she cheated, but I didnt remember how much it hurt her for me to seem distant. I didn't remember how I told her I hated her. I still don't, and to date, despite being a stoner, my memory rarely comes into question. My friends dont tell me I'm always forgetting things. My four sisters never make fun of me for it, and trust me, they would. My parents dont think there's any issue. Further, and perhaps more importantly, none of my doctors have ever mentioned that my memory has been affected. FFS, I still remember a dream from when I was in a crib. The idea that I forgot telling my angel, who represented my atonement at the time, that I hated her is laughable... but she claimed that thats where the cheating was born. So be it.

I took that fault onto myself, and forgave her again. I had to, because essentially I believed it was my fault at this point. She built this narrative in our relationship painting me as a full blown lunatic. Not the aggressive mean kind. The totally impaired, doesnt exist in reality kind. Kinda like how schizophrenics are portrayed in movies. My docs gave me more meds, according to the descriptions my fiancee (at the time) gave them. I encouraged her, in fact, to tell them what she was witnessing, since I was so out of my mind that I couldn't remember any of it. I became very afraid. And Im not a fearful person, but I was terrified of myself... I couldn't control what she was saying I was doing.. because I wasn't actually doing any of it. Thats not denial, thats objective fact that I didn't come to accept until later, and only after witnesses and VA docs took time to sorta, deprogram the mind control I had allowed her to exert over me.

Despite all the mind games, I thought I was still happy. I thought we all were, and she became pregnant. W my son! I had two first sons now! My oldest was my first child, and she was now pregnant w the first child I ever had a hand in making! My oldest son and I grew much closer, because I made extra certain to cement in his mind that I was the luckiest dad in the world cuz I had TWO first sons, and his importance would never dwindle just because my youngest existed and was blood related. We had father son days every saturday, and I introduced him to dumb shit I loved as a kid like DragonBall Z (i still dont think its dumb. lol.. well.. everything after frieza is kinda lame, but thats neither here nor there). We had been close before, but we were like best buds. He never complained that I forgot things, nor that I said weird out of character things. He never witnessed me being mean to his mother, or telling her I hated her. He was blissfully unaware she had ever cheated, and thought his mother and I had broken up because I had a mental break down, because thats what I told him.

Fast forward through the pregnancy, + 2 years, and I've got 2 sons, a fiancee, and a house w a floating dock and a boat. We were living a pretty comfortable life in northern california, away from our sorta slummy beginnings in central/west maryland. I loved my life. I worked at a dispensary! As an east coaster, working at a medicinal marijuana dispensary was so novel to me I literally whistled while I worked. Well... my (still) fiancee, at the time, hadn't worked in the entirety of our 9 or 10 years together at that point. She had quit working when she began dating me, because I was a bit more well to do than she was used to. I had a huge chunk of loot dropped in my lap after being crippled while active duty. I had a regular compensation check that more than covered our way of life. So for 9 or 10 years we had spent nearly every minute together until I had that dispensary job. At that point I guess I was distant again, because she cheated. She cheated and then tried to take my sons from me.

Now, during this story I've not claimed to have done any of the things she said I did. I believed it enough to accept responsibility for it, but according to our circle of friends, I was being used and abused. But when she came after my sons, I drew a line. I kicked her out of my house, not like, physically, I mean, I told her to leave. She moved in w one of our mutual friends, (who would later kick her out on her birthday, because of her behavior around her kids) began drinking and druggin' heavily and would show up at 2 in the morning and demand to see our kids, and I'd refuse. Id tell her to come back sober, which she'd refuse to do. She said she needed to get drunk or do meth to build her courage to see me. I mentioned in the beginning, Im a giant compared to her. Even if I had never once raised my voice, I understand thats intimidating for her to face, but she wasn't gonna be drunk or drugged around my sons. So when she claims I didn't let her see them... its true. Not quite in the context she declares it, but generally, it's true.

Anyway... I moved back to the east coast w my sons. Before I did, she and I had agreed not to go through the courts to establish rights, we'd be civil and talk between us, but I got her to sign a notarized statement saying she was fully aware I'd have my oldest son (since hes not mine biologically) and my youngest w me, that I'd care for them, that they'd visit her family and mine, and that she and I would continue to discuss visitation between us. A week later I moved back to the east coast, and 4 months after that she was pregnant again. W someone elses kid...

Its been nearly 4 years now. She spent large chunks of time never calling or visiting my boys. She actually NEVER came to see them. She only ever called or texted to fight w me and tell me I suck, or a couple of times she musta been drunk cuz she'd ask me to take her back.

This past December she called me and told me she was living w her mom in our hometown. She wanted to meet up and talk, and see the boys. She sounded healthy, and strong, and not on drugs. I was so proud of her, I believed her and brought our sons to see her. Every chance she got when they weren't paying attention she told me I was crazy. I've tried to be civil w her, and every time she still hits me w the head games, and it sorta worked. She had me going for a little bit, made me think I was crazy again... until someone pointed out that she had left her ex, taken their baby, and moved in w her mother, her youngest sister, and a few guys that had slept w both her mother and her youngest sister.

She's seen my sons 3 or 4 times since december, but shes already in love again, this time w her sisters ex boyfriend, whom shes attempting to marry w a jop (this is mad common in our home town, no one has weddings, they all just line up outside of the court house, chain smoking cigarettes and yelling at one another over who slept w who's ex). My sons birthday alone is gonna cost 250 bucks. Thats w no presents. He wants another xbox one (cuz his is damaged)... thats another 250. And his mother has repeatedly declined to throw anything towards that (she never has). Now that shes closer I thought she'd wanna be involved, and pitch in. No, she wants to spend money on the jop w her sisters ex, and a carton of smokes.

Money, btw, which would require her to lie to the IRS, and claim my sons on taxes. Anyway... now I find myself defending my parenting, and my character from this woman... and it scares me... terrifies me, really... because she always finds a way into my head. I don't defend myself when it comes to her... I still see that chick that died. I still feel so fuckin' responsible for her death, and I'm so desperate to be square w the house, that I keep letting this pale imitation (my kids ma), push me around.

She's essentially telling me I have to give her the boys socials so she can claim them on taxes, or she'll take them from me, because I'm crazy and unfit to be a parent. And even though its been all this time... when she calls me crazy, its like the bell for pavlov's dogs.

If you've managed to read all of this, I'd appreciate anything in the way of advice. Im really at a loss for what I should do. I feel like I can't fight for custody cuz I made a promise to her that we wouldn't involve the courts... even though shes threatening to do exactly that now, I dont wanna break my promise.

Thanks for letting me vent.

TL:DR - I'm worried the chick that emotionally abused me for like 10 or 11 years is gonna convince me or bully me into letting her take my sons from me.",JustopianAmbassador,2019-02-12 05:36:25,0,2962,17.87,51.22,67.56,21.62,14.88,14.18,90.45,59.55,24.54,19.45,11.01,0.95,0.44,6.55,0.51,5.1,4.9,10.94,9.32,5.54,7.83,2.43,18.67,3.54,1.96,1.49,1.89,1.69,5.5,2.6,2.87,0.44,1.38,0.27,16.34,1.86,0.71,6.41,2.13,12.83,2.97,2.13,1.08,2.43,1.69,3.65,1.79,0.78,0.54,0.41,1.86,0.51,0.78,0.41,0.24,6.89,3.04,1.28,1.38,0.84,0.51,9.01,7.12,0.64,13.74,1.99,5.77,6.52,0.84,0.74,0.37,0.51,0.07,0.3,1.76,0.34,0.64,0,0.14,0.17,20.05,8.41,7.33,0.03,0.07,0.03,0.14,0.07,0.27,2.7,0.95,0.07
apubz0,I need advice on how to approach my situation,"I posted this on aita first, and since getting feedback i decided to post here again.... i just want advice on how to handle this situation, how to speak to him. 

My boyfriend got drunk and showed up last night and passed out the bed without any bedsheets. I was washing a load when he appeared so i let him crash for about 50 mins while the dryer finished. when it was done i went to wake him up, softly and respectfully. I said “babe get up, i need to put sheets on the bed so that we can sleep comfortably”, and he wouldn’t move- so i keep trying. I tried a little harder and explained that i didn’t want to sleep on a bare mattress and that i needed him to get up to which he replied “fuck off let me sleep. “


After a few tries more he finally came through and told me to “go fuck myself and let him sleep” to which i replied “well if you’re gonna be a mean asshole i need you to get out of my house, i was just trying to get you comfortable. You’re either an asshole or you sleep in me house but not both”. I lost it and i yelled and i told him to leave repeatedly and he wouldn’t. 


He got really angry and started screaming. Foaming in the mouth. Yelling all sorts of abusive shit. I went and hid in the next room and locked myself in. He kept pounding it until he opened it.  Then he locked himself in there with me and blocked the door so he could scream more abuse at me.  I begged him to let me out. He wouldn’t. 


Eventually after about 2.5 hours of him yelling  someone called the police. It was the only thing that calmed him down. I finally fell asleep in my room at around 2 am.  He slept on the couch cause he was too drunk to drive. 


Today he’s justifying his actions saying  that i caused the whole thing. Now he’s saying he doesn’t remember what he said and that he reacted like because i bitched at him and kicked him out of my apartments in the first place. He doesn’t even live here. And i don’t think being drunk and not remembering is a free pass to treat someone however you want. I got mad in the first place because of the way he spoke to me. 


Anyway i want to break up. But i would like some good language tools on how to speak to him. I know I can’t fix a person but maybe i can help him realize that the reason he is losing me is because of his own creation.  How do i speak to someone who’s mentally justifying themselves so much that they don’t understand reasoning? What can i say to get through to the other person that can resonate with them and make them realize its their own fault and wrongdoing??",aplacarlapalca,2019-02-12 07:17:02,10,511,25.57,52.35,44.42,5.18,15.48,12.72,94.91,62.23,24.46,18.98,9.39,0.2,1.17,7.24,0.98,5.48,4.5,14.48,6.85,6.46,9,2.35,20.55,2.54,1.37,2.35,1.17,1.96,5.48,1.76,3.72,0,2.54,0.39,14.87,0,0.39,0,7.44,12.92,2.74,3.52,2.74,2.35,0.2,2.74,3.52,0.39,2.74,0.39,3.72,2.35,0.39,0.39,0.59,6.85,0.59,1.96,1.96,2.15,0.59,7.44,10.57,0.59,15.26,2.74,7.63,4.5,0.39,0.59,1.96,0.2,0,0,1.76,1.17,0.2,0,0.2,0.2,12.72,6.46,1.17,0,0,0.59,0,0.2,1.57,2.74,0,0

I am sorry my Father has no love or compassion. I am sorry you don’t like to be screamed at by a female. I am sorry you never ran out of a burning house and stood outside watching everything you own burn to the ground. I am sorry you never saw my Mother beg and pled for money for food &amp; clothes. I am sorry you never saw him come home drunk without a care in the world. I am sorry I have not slept in months living in shear panic and fear. But I am not sorry for fighting for my life, I am not sorry for begging and pleading with you for months that my Father will take every penny and leave me homeless. I am not sorry for protecting myself and I am not sorry for being a strong, out spoken female who has survived sexual and emotional abuse. And I will keep fighting – I will not be silent anymore!!! Enough is Enough! So, NO public adjuster I will NOT take your advice and keep my mouth shut – I will scream from the roof tops! 


I worked my butt off to get away from it all and ended up getting sick and not able to work anymore and YES my Dad did help me after I would beg and plead with him giving him TOTAL Control and I have to take it, all the abuse and I’m tired of it all. And he enjoyed it – it makes him feel better. That man took every penny after my Mom died and spent it on himself! Buying vacation home for himself and storage units full of garbage, going out and paying for everyone’s dinner and getting drunk. My Mother’s last dying breath, Make sure he does not take it from you. What part of he has a personality disorder do you not understand, what part of he is hoarder do you not understand, what part of he is an emotionally abusive man do you not understand. When he comes home drunk and fights with me because he is drunk and tells me to go FK Yourself or Go get FK*NG laid it will make me feel better. That is my father! Father of the Year! The man people do not know because he lies, cheats, steals and is a master manipulator! 


So public adjuster, I know he is your client and you care about him, not me. But do not tell me, ever, to not talk to you in an irrational way when I am fighting for my life. When I ration my food not knowing when and if I will be able to buy groceries. When I am alone, scared and full of anxiety and panic because no one is going to help me!

apwx5q,I think my grand mother might be abusive but I’m not sure can you guys help me determine if she is?,"A couple things have lead me to believe this but I’m not sure so maybe you guys could help me out
1. She goes into very long angry rants over the slightest thing like me dirtying up a bowl
2. After I self harmed she called me a monster and then gas lighted me about it when I told everyone about it
3. I’m not in school despite wanting to because she took me out of it
4. She makes fun of how passionate I get when I try to defend myself
5. Spent my entire life complaining about my own mother that I loved dearly to me
6. Said I would never be anything if I didn’t believe in god (she also said I would go to hell if I didn’t go to church everyday)
7. Showed me photos of children after I had just learned my sister miscarried and I didn’t want to look at children for a while even when I already told her that
8. Got mad when I wouldn’t eat oatmeal she made with spoiled milk
9. Deliberately takes things I say out of context and tells them to other family members to make me look bad and gets mad when I correct her
10. Calls me ion (that’s the name of the man who abused my mother) when I don’t listen to her
11. Threatened to send me to the mental institute when I do mild things like refuse to sit next to her

There’s lots more but this post has already gone on long enough I don’t know if this is abuse or not and I’m just a terrible out of control child I don’t know what’s real

apxoe5,Help with repressed memories,"TW: childhood sexual abuse!!

Okay, so a) this is a throwaway account and b) I’m new to reddit so I apologize in advance for any etiquette mistakes.

Alright. Basically, in October of 2017 my brother who was 14 at the time came forward to tell me he had been sexually abused by our biological father for the entirety of his childhood. Neither of us had seen our father in two years because he lost his partial custody over various contempt’s of court. I believe that my brother finally felt safe enough to come forward at this point. My mother and I had absolutely no idea this was going on, so you can imagine the strain this has put on my family. He and my mother have been in intensive therapy ever since, and he is coping very well. We are in the process of legal proceedings and God willing my father will hopefully be convicted within this year. So, I spent basically all of 2018 very angry and upset and defensive and doing everything in my power to help my brother heal and cope with the knowledge the best I could.

So I say all that to say this: Now that I have had time to process all of this, I believe I may have also been molested. I am a 21 y/o college student (female). I have always had extreme issues with recalling even basic childhood memories. What I do recall is once my brother was born, my father almost completely shutting me out. He was not subtle about his dislike for me. He took my brother on special trips and doted on him in ways he never did for me. Unfortunately, I now know that this is because he was grooming him. 
Dad was extremely verbally abusive and occasionally psychically as well. I have questioned the possibility that perhaps I was molested as well since my brother came forward, but I’ve only started to recover some blurry memories here recently. I have one in particular in which he came into my bed strung out and crying, but that’s all I remember.

So, lovely reddit community, here are my questions for you guys:

Is it possible I was abused? Since he abused my brother does it make it more likely? Or less likely?

Should I even bother trying to recover these memories? 

Should I tell my therapist?

Thanks in advance.",dumbbitchhours247,2019-02-12 12:14:27,1,406,21.45,52.96,74.1,6.54,15.04,20.94,93.6,58.62,20.94,15.52,10.34,0.99,0.49,3.69,0,5.42,2.46,12.56,11.08,7.64,6.4,0.99,17.98,4.93,2.22,0.74,1.72,2.46,7.88,2.96,4.68,0.74,1.97,0.49,11.82,3.69,0.25,0.74,6.9,13.79,3.94,1.48,1.23,3.94,2.96,1.23,0.99,0.25,0.49,0.25,1.48,0,0.74,0.49,0,7.39,3.69,1.72,1.97,1.23,0.25,7.14,8.87,0.99,14.29,2.96,6.16,6.65,0.99,0.99,0.49,0.49,0.25,0,2.46,0,0.99,0.74,0.74,0,12.56,4.93,2.96,0.74,0,1.23,0.49,0,0,0.99,0.99,0.25

The longer I go without a remedy, the more worthless I start to feel. Those old voices telling me to hide, put my head down and wait for the storm to blow over - just don’t get hurt, start to speak. I should be ok that the ball is in their court and there is nothing more for me to do at this time. However, this triggers abandonment issues in me. I could use insight on this.

apy30d,I'm tired of being nice,"Okay so I don't ever post online about my issues but right now my family is arguing downstairs. My brother is nearly 19 and he doesn't have a car, he still lives at home, and won't finish his school work. He's been incredibly abusive to my parents who are nearly in their 60's. my dad is the only one who works in this house aside from him, he doesn't pay rent, doesn't buy food, he doesn't contribute anything to this household. my entire life has been me seeing therapist after therapist see him when I had no help. While I was being sexually assaulted he was seeing a therapist because hes fucking crazy. When we were kids he burnt the house down and blamed me for 7 years. I have NEVER done a thing wrong in my life, I've never been arrested, never done drugs, the only bad thing I've ever done was fail a class and he throws it in my face all the time. If you were to ask all of my friends and teachers about me they'd say I'm the kindest person they know. My friends say I don't deserve what my family does to me. god I'm so scared. he steals things from me too. last year he stole a ring I got from my uncle when I was a kid.. that ring meat the world to me but all it was for him was lousy ""$160"" he comes into my room and listens to my phone conversations, goes through my underwear drawer, READS MY TEXTS! My parents wont kick him out and I've been doing everything I can to get away from him. guys I'm so scared. and really I do not want your pity, all I want is somewhere to share my feelings. He's constantly on my ass about how I don't have a job but I'm not allowed to work due to where I live at and the fact that my parents won't let me get a job till I'm 18.

a brother is someone who's supposed to have your back no matter what, he's not supposed to be abusive or stalk you. He's supposed to hang out with you and not break into your room and take videos of you when you're changing while calling you a ""fat whore"" He's supposed to be your best friend from the day you were born but he throws the fact that you've been assaulted many times in your face...

aq01jh,is this abuse??,"apologies for what might be a weird post but my friend told me my grandmother is abusive and ive never really thought of it before. (also i am sorry for the spaces between lines but it is a lot easier to read)

my household consists of my grandmother &amp; grandfather, great-grandfather, mother, &amp; myself. we have 2 cats and my cousins are over most of the time.

my mom is trying to save up for a house for just the two of us and my grandmother is retired so she is home most of the time i’m awake, so she sees me more than my mom.

- she yells at my mother when she isn’t home by 6 pm. my mother is 40 years old. she argues with my mom about me to the point where my mom comes downstairs crying sometimes.

- she is in charge of babysitting my 2 yr old, 4 yr old and 8 yr old cousins while their parents are at work. she screams at the top of her lungs and threatens to hit/does hit them when they do normal kid stuff. she constantly calls the younger kids “faggots” because they cry when she yells.

- after i went to guidance in 6th grade and told my counselor i had tried to kill myself the night prior, she found out when i got home and berated me for 20 minutes. she told me i was selfish and that i’m disgusting.

- has threatened to beat me multiple times for not seeing her texts. 

theres more but honestly if she finds this she’ll know it’s her so i’m not going to put anything else down. thanks in advance. sorry for the empty account but i’m not comfortable putting this on my main",-andonuts,2019-02-12 15:49:42,5,297,30.01,47.31,80.98,1,17.47,12.79,91.92,56.9,21.89,18.52,11.11,0.67,0,5.39,1.35,3.37,4.04,13.47,9.43,5.05,7.74,1.68,17.85,5.72,3.37,2.02,2.69,2.02,7.74,2.02,5.72,0.67,2.69,1.68,15.82,5.05,0.34,8.75,0.67,8.42,1.35,0.34,0.34,2.69,0.34,4.04,1.68,0.67,1.01,0,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,7.41,2.02,2.36,3.03,1.01,0.67,3.37,10.77,1.01,15.49,2.02,5.72,7.41,1.68,0,1.68,0.34,0,0.34,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,0,14.81,5.05,2.02,0,0.67,0.67,0,1.68,0.67,2.36,0.67,1.01
aq0mc4,TL;DR Why has she done this stuff for years,"I was in high school as a younger boy. She was an older girl. She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We’d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.

Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything. She has dated other guys and dated a guy while doing this stuff and just doesn't stop. I made my IG public and screens hotted a funny post from a site I frequent. Days later she posts on that site a question about finding the one and it is just a rant and talking about other guys under her name. Created an account just to post that and never went back on.

I am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it.

PS: I am autistic but on the high functioning end of the spectrum and not everyone knows it or thinks it but I struggle with social cues and such.",Faraway62018,2019-02-12 16:49:18,0,1442,21.7,66.89,70.34,29.24,18.02,12.34,96.05,62.07,24.41,20.11,10.26,0.55,0.07,8.81,0.42,4.3,3.12,14.77,5.76,6.45,10.89,2.29,18.1,3.68,1.87,1.66,0.42,1.32,5.62,2.91,2.7,0.69,0.62,0.42,19.28,0.55,2.01,9.15,0.76,9.92,1.8,0.97,1.6,2.5,1.53,2.84,5.55,3.47,1.6,0.49,0.97,0.69,0.21,0,0.07,8.11,3.26,0.83,1.66,1.53,1.18,7,8.11,1.32,19.69,2.29,8.67,8.81,0.97,0.69,0.35,0.21,0,0.07,0.76,0.14,0.55,0,0.07,0,8.67,5.62,1.39,0.07,0.07,0,0,0,0.14,1.25,0,0.14
aq1oem,Was my childhood bad? Help.,"**UNEDITED: EXCUSE ERRORS* I’m sorry in advance for how long this post is going to be and no, there’s no tl;dr. For some reason, I have a hard time distinguishing if my childhood was bad, normal, or somewhere in between. I’m going to list everything that I’ve suffered from during the ages of 6-17. I should be clear on my upbringing before I get to the abuse.

I’m an African American female, and currently nineteen years old. My mother had me, her first born, when she was 23 years old with my father who was 34. I am my father’s only child. By the time I was born, they had been dating for three years. After I was born, my father stayed in and out of jail for reasons that he never shared with me. A couple of months after my birth, they separated and never got back together. So I never had the feeling of seeing my parents together as a couple and I only saw him on the weekends when I would stay at his place.

When I was about a year old, my mother had dropped out of university and got a new boyfriend. We’ll call him J. By the time I could talk, I was forced to call him Dad, meaning I was calling two different men Dad. She stayed with him for about eight years, and had two children by him. I never treated my half-siblings less than what they were but I do remember feeling distant from them in a slightest way. Their parents were together, and they had the same two parents. I, however, couldn’t relate.

During their relationship, my mother was enrolled in community college. During the relationship, she was always beaten and ruthlessly cheated on. Six year old me would be struggling with my mathematic homework, and her boyfriend would be in the next room, strangling my mother until she lost consciousness. While she was pregnant, he slammed and shattered a glass coffee table over her body. My mother kept silent about it, and if I spoke to anyone in the family about it, I would be physically punished by the both of them and dubbed “Fox News” because I “run my mouth too much”.

My mother ended up dropping out from college completely. J had an illegitimate that did not bring in a steady income and my mom didn’t work at all. We struggled, and I never was the child that had what their friends had, but we always made ends meet. On weekends, my second oldest sibling and I would spend time with J’s mother, who I called my grandmother. It was nice over there, we were spoiled, got hugs, tended to, and always knew that we were loved. Plus, I wouldn’t have to see J, who would probably be aiming a gun at my mother’s head, and threatening to kill her. My grandmother didn’t have much. She lived alone in a small house and was on a fixed income. She suffered from schizophrenia and was unable to work. But, on medication, my grandmother was a stable woman. She chaperoned on my elementary school’s field trips to the zoo. She gave my brother and I money, even if it was just a dollar, so we could get an idea of what saving is and get used to it. Those were things my mom and J failed to do. She loved listening to music, 70’s and 80’s classic r&amp;b/soul to be specific. It’s all she ever listened to. That’s what we would do together. She taught me how to tell time on a wall clock, she took pictures of me to go in the family photo album, she took me to parks, she spent actual time with me and I wasn’t even her biological granddaughter. 

There was a period where I made the mistake of telling her about our household problems and she threatened to call Child Protective Services. I remember getting the whooping of my life, and we stayed away from Grandma’s for awhile.


My mother finally left him when I was about nine years old. Usually, J would cheat on my mom with other women, his friends, her friends, and hookers. But this time, he had another girlfriend and did more for her children than he did for me and my siblings. My mom took me, my two siblings, and we moved to a one bedroom apartment. She got a job at a shoe store inside of a mall to support us. She walked us to school each morning since it was right down the road. During this time, she was suffering from untreated manic depression (bipolar disorder) and being unhappy with life, she had planned to kill herself. However, she didn’t follow through because of me and my siblings. She had children to finish half-ass raising. We hardly ate anything besides boiled hot dogs and most nights we went to sleep hungry. Our apartment became bedbug infested. Hundreds were lined up in the creases of the only bed in the apartment, in every window curtain that was actually a bedsheet, and behind the sofa. My siblings and I slept on the L shaped sofa, while my mother pulled the dining table chairs together and slept on those instead. I would wake up early for school with bedbugs in the creases of my arms, and shaking them off of my clothing.

In these moments, I had started being bullied in school for my dark skin tone that apparently made me ugly and undesirable. I had no one telling me that I was beautiful, I only heard the opposite. My mother really had no time to deal with my problems when she had bigger one’s. We never had any reassuring talks or discussions, she never involved herself in my life as a loving and caring mother. Her job was to provide food and shelter, that’s it. My siblings and I were often victims of her bipolar episodes and would have to endure her screaming and hitting. Even as a ten year old, I noticed the menacing look in her eyes during an episode. So evil and empty, she would have liked to see us drop dead. 

My mother was very distant from everyone, so during this period I did not see my grandmother or my real dad. And of course we never heard from J, thank God. She met a White guy who we’ll call A, below our floor and began a relationship with him. He was nice in the beginning and since I didn’t know any better, I was open to meeting and becoming comfortable around new people. Eventually, our living situation was ruined, the complex got shut down and everyone had to go.

We had nowhere to turn and went to a homeless shelter. It was a place that allowed you to stay for a maximum of thirty days. However, my mom and baby sister refused to eat the horrible food served. Other people staying there were rude and nasty, so weren’t even there a week. We moved to my grandmother’s place, stayed there for a few weeks until J’s sister, who’s always hated my mother, demanded that we leave.. in the middle of wintertime. 

So, we went to stay with J again. He had moved into a place closer to my school with the same girlfriend and her two children who weren’t even 5. They were ridiculously favored and J still acted as if he was my dad when it came to punishments, despite he and my mom being broken up. She didn’t seem to have an issue with it, and even befriended him and his girlfriend. J and his girlfriend ended up being evicted from their home not that much later, so, we moved in with some family friends who lived on the other side of town.

Living there was one hell of an experience. They were a couple with two young kids of their own. The guy would normally beat his girlfriend. They smoked crack together, in front of. They had sex wherever and whenever, sometimes participating in threesomes. My mother had nothing to do with the drug thing or threesome thing, but she was cheating on A with a much older guy. My mom was a woman who couldn’t go that long without being romantically linked to someone, I had to find out in that way. I remember, at ten, wondering how she could cheat on someone. Her boyfriend, A, was away in a different state due to intense family problems and could not be where we were. 

The couple had rats living in the family flat. Rats, not mice. We would wake up at 5 AM to get ready for school. Because my mom didn’t have a car, we had to take public transportation to school. We’d huddle together at the bus stop, and I’d be sobbing because it was so cold. It was so dark outside and looked like a ghost town, I was frightened all of them time. My tears and snot would freeze while we waited. We caught 3 different buses just to make it there on time. 

By the time spring had arrived and I was eleven, A had returned and had enough money for us to rent a house out and live together. We switched schools and moved in with A. He showed his shitty true colors within time and only got worse from there. Around this time, my mom told me to stop telling her about me being bullied at school because she was tired of hearing about it. Six years, 4 school switches and a new sibling later, I made the move to leave home because living with A and a bipolar woman who chose when it was okay to love me became unbearable. A became a guilt tripper, an emotional manipulator, toxic, controlling and abusive towards everyone in the house. I felt like a troubled celebrity in a sense. Putting on a smile in front of distant relatives, friends, and while at school. But behind closed doors, A was choking my mother, and physically hitting everyone in the house. He was screaming at us at the top of his lungs that we were worthless and stupid and b*tches. He would comment to my mom about how ugly he thought I was in the face. Hand as the eldest sibling, I took a lot of the fire, always having to defend my mother and siblings. He said if we ever called the police on him that he would put us in the f***ing ground and I honestly wouldn’t put it past him. After another usual disagreement, he was threatening to beat me if I didn’t do what he asked me to do and I decided that I wasn’t going to keep dealing with him and my mom succumbing to this psychopath. I was 17 then and my mom, who always forgave him after a big fight, told me “he’s who I’m with. If you don’t like it, you can leave”. So I did.

I moved in with J in the middle of 12th grade. He was my only option. My grandmother passed when I was twelve and my biological father stepped out of my life for good a year or two later. J was still the exact same minus having a girlfriend and attempted to treat me the way he treated my mother. It was cool in the beginning, but he began using me for his advantage by taking my money and treating me as his maid and talking to me like a child. A year and a half passed and he started screaming about how life was easier before I moved in, about how if I act up, he’ll send me back to my mother’s place, about how he technically doesn’t have to do anything for me because he’s not my biological father.

 He engaged in sex with hookers that are around my age almost every night, and it was always a new face. I never saw the same girl twice. He tried to take away my voice and I was never allowed an opinion or able to express my frustration without being threatened with physical harm. I’m scared to travel alone in the dark and whenever I would tell him that an older man followed me home from school and that I felt unsafe, which happened on a few occasions, he’d laugh at me. He never took it serious enough.

 The prostitues were usually cruel to me and would tell him that I secretly have a boyfriend. He’d believe them, he’d verbally lash out on me, a nineteen year old. For the record, I’ve never had a boyfriend and have never engaged in sex, drinking, smoking or drugs. At all.

It’s hard for him, my mom, and A to believe because in my environment, the teenagers are pregnant by the time they’re eighteen years old. So, they don’t believe me.

He completely says he’s never hurt my mom in any way and if anyone asks why they broke up, he’d say because she wasn’t performing housewife duties as a girlfriend should, so he dumped her. Which of course was a bold faced lie. He thinks that I’ve forgotten about the domestic violence because I was young. In December 2018, I had done something that pissed him off. I was feeling particularly suicidal that day and after I snatched something from the coffee table with an attitude, he charged at me the same way he used to charge at my mother before he’d choke her out. I dodged in time and ran into my bedroom, slamming the door shut. I shook and cried for hours because I couldn’t believe that I was in that position. When I came out of my room, he looked like he was sorry but didn’t say it. Instead, he tried to make up for it by being nice and taking me out to eat. That same week I called my aunt and told her that I needed to leave immediately before I actually became a victim. I was unhappy there, not as unhappy as I was when I lived with my mom, but still very, very unhappy. 

Living with both J and then A, I’ve missed countless menstrual cycles, have had my blood pressure run high due to stress dealing with bullies at school and home life, cried myself to sleep and contemplated suicide most days. But now that we’ve got the background out of the way... was that abuse? I’ve separated the kinds of childhood abuse, because there is physical, psychological, verbal, and sexual. Plus, neglect.

PHYSICAL:
I don’t think that I was physically abused but I’ll still explain.
- As a child, whenever I’d be in trouble J would have me place my hands on a wall while he whipped me with a thick belt. Sometimes I’d have to pull my pants down and stand in my underwear. I wouldn’t have marks, but it’d be difficult and very painful to sit down afterwards.
- As a teenager, A would whip me with a belt but in a different manner. He’d hold the buckle and fling the belt wherever he could hit, like you would with an actual whip. It didn’t happen often but when it did, I’d have red marks on my skin and black marks would be on the wall from where he hit on times he missed.
- As I got older, that turned into kicking and smacking across the face.

PSYCHOLOGICAL:
- On numerous occasions, my mom and  A called me a stupid bitch and other names.
- A yelled a lot over minuscule things. If you were to leave something on the ground by accident, say a towel, he’d scream his head off for 30 minutes straight. Red in the face, and making sure you know just how stupid you are.
- A constantly picked on me for my weight, since I was underweight when I lived there
- My biological father would punish me by giving 11 year old me the silent treatment. He’d have irritation and attitude in his face, saying that he wished that I was born a boy instead. Whenever we’d go to a place, I’d tag along inside of the store. But when it was a bad day and he was upset with me, he’d force me to stay in the car while he an my cousin who was my age would go shopping and not buy me anything. He would play mind games and create problems out of thin air, I would never know why he was upset at me.. it was like he’d flip into a different person in a matter of seconds. I was an honor roll student and a shy, mild-mannered child... what was I doing wrong?

SEXUAL:
*TRIGGER* 
The most painful for me to talk about. The memories that I’ve repressed for years.
- Starting when I was around six, my grandmother’s younger boyfriend, who was around mid-40s, would regularly molest me on the weekends. He’d wait until late night, force me to watch pornographic movies, perform oral sex on me, and make me perform oral sex on him.
- When I was around eleven, my biological father forced me to give him a hand in masturbation. Directly after the event, he apologized but I don’t think that I can accept his apology. If we ever cross paths again, I will never be comfortable around him.
- As I got older, about two other men would touch and grope me inappropriately.
NEGLECT:
- I don’t think I’ve been purposely neglected? Not sure. If I never had school supplies, winter boots, or a coat, it was because of financial instability. But A and my mom also smoke through several packs of cigarettes and a lot of weed every week. They absolutely cannot go without weed but I can go without pads for when I’m on my cycle, right?

I’ll be twenty this spring. Last month, I moved in with my mom’s older sister. Living here, I don’t have to be threatened, or hit, smacked, kicked, humiliated, berated or treated like a child. I don’t have to witness it either. I won’t be screamed at for fixing myself something to eat. My aunt expresses how sorry she is that I had to go through such a bad time. She tells me that my childhood wasn’t normal and that I might need therapy. 

I haven’t lived with my mom since 2016 and I still have intense nightmares of being at her house and A badly harming her. Whenever I try to intervene, she gets mad at ME for doing anything.

As for what I feel.. I’m depressed and socially anxious. I steer clear away from any men, and the thought of being sexual with a guy makes me nauseous and fearful. I cant imagine why anyone would ever love me or like what they see. I feel as though I shouldn’t be alive. I have urges to involve myself in drug use. I cant walk into a public place without thinking and believing that everyone in the room is talking and whispering bad things about me. I’ve lost interest in things that once made me happy, like writing. I feel hopeless, worthless, I socially isolate myself. I repeatedly go over thoughts and think of ways I could kill myself. I have highs and lows, there are days where I feel happy and okay with life and I think that I’m okay. Then it comes crashing down a day or two later, I wake up and the first thing I do is cry. In those dark days, I feel like I’ve dissociated and lost myself, I feel like here but mentally, I’m not all the way here. I actually live with someone who used to inappropriately touch me when I was younger and now I’m extremely jumpy and worrisome around him. 

Was the stuff I went through bad or am I just being dramatic and making shit up?

aq3isr,Is it possible I forgot some abuse from my past?,"I remember some emotional and physical abuse from when I was older, but for the past several years, I’ve believed that I was sexually abused when I was a lot younger. My therapist wants me to journal about it so I am. As I was doing it, I did some research and I realized I demonstrate many of the symptoms. Is it possible that I repressed it? I know repression is a very controversial topic but I honestly don’t remember much of my life before 12 years old and I believe the abuse happened at 7 or earlier. Support would be much appreciated. 

Side note: I believe it was my uncle. He molested my cousin. I’m younger than her and have always been told how similar we look. I have distinct memories of being afraid of him. One example is crying when my parents tried to make me dance with him at a wedding when I was 7. I’m still very anxious around him but thankfully have only seen him twice in the past 10 years.",walking_cliche_,2019-02-12 22:15:59,1,186,11.68,12.94,96.27,1,14.31,19.35,94.62,57.53,23.12,18.82,15.05,0.54,0,3.23,0,4.3,3.76,9.68,12.9,6.45,8.06,0.54,22.04,6.45,4.3,2.69,3.23,4.3,8.06,2.15,5.91,2.15,2.15,0.54,6.99,2.15,0,0.54,3.23,13.98,4.84,1.08,1.08,3.76,1.08,3.23,1.08,1.08,0,0,2.69,0,2.15,0.54,0,3.23,2.69,0.54,0,0,0,11.29,10.75,0.54,12.9,0.54,2.69,9.68,0.54,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.29,5.91,1.61,0.54,0,1.08,0,0,0,2.15,0,0
aq49aq,I'm terrified of what comes next,"I was asking for support recently from my psychiatrist in contacting somebody to discuss clarification about whether I experienced sexual abuse from a sibling (they're only 2 years 2 months older, happened when I was 8 and another time before 10/11, to my memory). I don't know whether she was a perpetrator or mostly a victim herself. Bad family boundaries were likely a factor.

I was given a couple of phone numbers for organisations that could help. I got an email after speaking on the phone with more phone numbers for other organisations, saying such discussions are basically not what they deal with.

So my psychiatrist called to say he contacted the safeguarding team and they say he needs to contact child social services who may need to contact the police. I imagine the worry is that they are a single parent, who lives with our parents. I am somewhat concerned about this because I'm no expert in the associated risks, but I'm scared of my niece being with the other parent more than with them. But maybe gaslighting has just gotten to me too much.

I brought up the abuse a year ago. He decides to contact them two weeks ago when I ask for support. What I'll get is an interrogation I'm not prepared for. My psychiatrist also treats this sibling and one of our parents. When I asked again as I do every time if it was appropriate for him to be treating me he didn't ignore me like before and said I could make such an enquiry with the clinic if I wanted to. I told him I was asking him, he said he'll pass my question along.

I wanted to define the experience before involving anyone like social services. If it's just a fucked up mess that everyone is healing from then my family is about to be torn apart again and all the reasons I've been trying to address this so carefully have me scared for my family, despite the anger I still have.

I was hoping an expert would either confirm I experienced abuse and help me take appropriate steps to fix things, or explain that the age gap suggests that this isn't so serious and things can be more easily healed. I don't want to prosecute, and I don't know if I even could.

My Dad won't take this stress. Vascular dementia. He was just starting to get better. My Mother is gonna be destroyed. She won't know how to handle it, she'll want to protect us both whilst denying she could've done anything better.

I wanted an apology and to move on, I was hoping that maybe the psychiatrist could facilitate that in time. I got an apology but it wasn't honest. It was amongst gaslighting that we were actually younger (I think to preserve innocence?) When I said to my mother that I'm sure it had fucked me up she said ""But you were so young when it happened"". So conversations were obviously had. I had spoken to my sibling directly before anyone else in the family. They've been breaking down since. They need therapy, which they are trying to access again of their own volition.

I don't know what to believe anymore. I needed clarification. Now I'll only get it with it being out of my control. How am I supposed to trust these people?

I told my psychiatrist all my fears and how I wanted to approach this. He went and spoke to a board without asking me and now he's being told he's obligated to report. After a year of knowing. I said in a meeting with this psyche, ADHD psyche and my psychotherapist that I didn't know if I needed to report it, but I imagined if they were a risk to their daughter then one of them would've surely done something by now. I never expected this to happen after this amount of time.

I just wanna fucking kill myself to get out. Thank fuck I have my girlfriend. I'm terrified of police being involved. They're corrupt as hell and helped our neighbors to harass us for years because our neighbor was mayor. We just came from a bad neighbor situation and I don't think my parents handled it well either; too raw from the past.

I wish I'd never mentioned it. I'm not ready. They still won't give me the only medication that ever worked for me because it was off-label and these guys don't want to accept liability for if it goes wrong. If he'd bothered to check some.things with me first, he would know I just got signed off from therapy for in April and have no session this week.

I was already not sleeping. Fuck I don't know what to do. Everything I'm terrified of might happen and short of faking total insanity I don't know how to feel in control again. I think I preferred carrying this weight myself and checking in on my niece to make sure she's safe. It's those checks that have me almost certain enough that she won't get fucked up, at least not through physical or sexual abuse.

For a while I thought I was more of a risk, but therapy cleared that up for me and I'm over the fear that I may pass on trauma.

This is the worst timing. I can't undo this. I hate this. I just want it all to stop.",frustr8tion,2019-02-12 23:58:27,6,920,20.26,33.57,61.28,5.19,15.08,15.54,93.91,61.74,23.37,15.76,10.98,0.87,0.11,2.39,1.41,7.61,4.24,13.59,11.41,5.87,6.85,2.93,22.93,4.57,2.72,2.07,1.09,2.17,6.63,2.28,4.24,1.3,1.85,0,13.7,1.96,0.87,1.41,1.85,15.33,2.93,1.52,4.02,3.48,1.74,4.24,2.07,0,1.52,0.22,2.07,0.11,0.98,0.87,0.11,8.91,3.26,0.76,2.39,1.63,1.41,7.83,11.74,2.17,10.98,1.3,3.59,6.09,1.2,0.54,0.87,0,0.11,0.11,1.09,0.76,0.11,0,0.11,0,14.13,6.41,1.85,0,0.11,0.22,0,0.11,0.22,4.67,0.43,0.11
aq4rkj,I'm so so exhausted,"I'm so tired.  
Everyday I feel drained, exhausted, dazed. I wake up some days not knowing where I am. I stumble out of bed sometimes. I literally feel so unbalanced. The smallest little push has me losing my balance. My mind acts very similar; every little stress has me stumbling to regain control. I'm so exhausted trying so hard to keep myself standing. I know others have it worse. I often watch Youtube videos of people who's bodies literally fall apart, their minds surrendering to seizures every hour of every day, women who's husbands beat them, or children starving. I keep telling myself I need to be grateful for what I have. I need to be happy. I need to love myself for what I have and who I am. My challenges don't own me, I own me.  


I can't. Everything is such a challenge. Simply greeting my customers and clients at work drain me. I don't care. I don't care to know you, your name, where you're from. Leave me alone. I want peace. I don't even know who I am, why should I care to know all about you?  


I should be proud I made it this far. I grew up in an abusive and neglectful home. I made it this far, right? I own a car in my name, a job, I live in a home I'm working on buying, I'm the only one of my sisters going to college, I have a boyfriend who doesn't put me down, hit me, or purposely neglects me. Why does my past always have to resurface? Why can't I just be happy and grateful???   


I'm out of that place. I don't speak much to my mom anymore. It's rare we see each other, and when we do...oddly she's seemingly nice. She gave me a hello kitty beanie hat four months ago. I told her I loved it. It's hanging on my wall and haven't touched it since.   


I want to forgive her, but the images and dialogue haunt me. I didn't learn until I was fifth-teen that I was born out of rape. I became irritable and easily angry with my mother and especially with my dad. I wouldn't dare hug him, kiss him, or give into his hurtful jokes about my weight or how I didn't know Spanish even though I'm Hispanic. My mom told my doctor I was crazy and I need psych help. I still won't forget the day they sent my mother first to speak with the psych and when it was my turn to talk alone with this man he confronted me. ""Why are you making your mother so sick, can't you see she has enough stress, how could you make your mother cry like that""?   


I remember being in a mix of emotions. Angry, hurt, scared, confused, shocked, sad. I didn't know how to react. If I got angry, it would just prove to him I'm some evil monster child. I knew what my mom had done. She's done it so many times as a classic narcissist.   


I remember trying to plead my case. I just moved to Texas after finally living in one place for ten years, after months of moving city to city. I moved my sophomore year and it had taken me so long to finally find a group of wholesome loving friends who understood me, and in less than a month my home, my life, and everything was so abruptly ripped away. I remember how bad I felt when I asked my dad where my bike was so I could load it in the U-haul and he told me, ""Que pinche bike, I sold it"", I remember crying and I got cussed out in Spanish for it. I rode my bike everyday to school and back. I was rarely let outside at home, and my bike was my greatest freedom in the mornings and back from school. To them it didn't seem like much, for me it was a big part of me. My parents rarely spent time with me, they were either working, partying, or locked away in their rooms fighting or sleeping their hangovers away.   


I tried sharing these small things with this psych. He got this light bulb look on his face, ""Oh so you hate your dad because he sold your bike, don't you think you're being selfish, you know your mom just lost her job and all you could think of is a bike, that's no reason to hate your dad"".  


Looking back at this, I don't even know how this man became a damn Dr. of any fucking damn kind. His room was filled with Christian symbols and icons. He continued to make me seem like some terrible kid who was ungrateful. He then questioned my religion, and why as a Hispanic do I refuse to know Spanish. At this point I was already crying.   


I hate Spanish because any time my family used it was to cuss me out and call me a fucking pig, prostitute, ugly, disgraceful, and other fucked up shit. I hate it, I hate it to this fucking day even though I'm always so forced to fucking use it. Fuck everyone man. Just because I'm a fucking few shades darker than anyone, everyone expects me to know fucking Spanish and if I don't I get shat on by my own supposed kind. Fuck that.   


I hated my dad so much. I always did. He always treated me different than my sisters. He spoiled them while I was forced to stay indoors and do chores why both him and my mom slept their hangovers away from drinking after long shifts. I was the oldest and when my baby sister was born my mom would entrust him to take care of the newborn, but would lock himself in my room and told me it was my job to care for my baby sister. I was only 8 fucking years old! I was always so tired after spending all night rocking her to sleep, feeding her, and making sure she wouldn't cry. I""ll never fucking forget the day I caught him cheating in the bedroom and I got yelled at and threatened with a beating. He would grab my shirt around my neck pull me in and curse me out in my ear in such a menacing way I was left shaking. He'd kill me if I told my mom anything. I thought I was safe until I started crying and I got slapped. I was left to take care of my baby sister...I regret it to this fucking day when I shook her so violently. I wish God would strike me down as I type this. I hope he could forgive me. I would spend so much time taking care of her, reading to her even if she couldn't understand me. I love her. To this day out of the once or twice a year I get to see her she rushes to hug me. I love her to pieces. When she was a toddler she would call me mama. The guilt, shame, and uneasiness of those words still sit with me. She doesn't think of me that way anymore, and I'm glad she doesn't remember any of that. I hope it isn't ingrained in her psyche some how..I fear that the most.   


My dad is a complete piece of shit. But, the most fucked up thing about it was he really wasn't my dad. A part of me knew it all too well and everyone in my family would be puzzled and questioned to why I resent and hate him so much. My second cousin who helped raise me as a toddler knew something was up. I remember her taking me to Starbucks for the first time. We chatted about anime, boys, and life. We eventually got talking about my dad and what's really going on. I felt like she was someone I could really trust, someone who actually took the time to know me as a person. I told her so much. How he hit me, threatened me, cheated on my mom, locked me up, how he got so drunk with our neighbor he nearly let him hit on me thinking I was his sister. I told her how I think he molested me a year ago and how confused and dirty I've been feeling. How I found him looking up porn when I got home from school early and how he turned the computer screen off so quickly. I felt uncomfortable, but let it go because mom says it's normal for dad to have an erection. He often walked around the house in his boxers even though I told mom I was uncomfortable with it, but my younger sisters and mom seem to think it was okay...so I let it slide by...  


I tried to get to my room as quickly as possible, but was stopped by his, ""What, you're going to your room, see I know you hate me, your mom's right, go ahead and go to your fucking room, I just want to spend time with you, it's like you don't even love me""?! I felt guilty for whatever reason. He often pulled the, ""Why don't you love me, I work so hard to provide for you""? line. It always got to me because he got me my bike and he would buy me burger king every Friday.   


He asked about my day at school..I found it to be weird. I told him I wanted to go to my room because my back hurt. He offered a massage, but I said no. He insisted and got angry that I wouldn't let him help me and how that was another sign that I don't love him and I'm ungrateful. He told me to get on the couch on my stomach so he could massage my back. I felt so wrong...I was home alone with ..my dad...but something didn't feel right. I kept telling him I think I'm fine, I just want to lay down, but he insisted..I felt something touch my bottom..rubbing. For a second I wasn't so sure what that was, his knee...his arm?? It didn't make sense..but what I did know was this didn't feel right one bit. I panicked and rushed to get up and noticed the erection in his track suit pants. I went straight to my room and locked it. I can't remember too much after that other than his yelling, keys, a slamming door and the car being angrily driven away. I could only remember sitting on my bed and staring at the floor for as long as I could, relieved that he was gone...but...not really. I never spoke about it to anyone for over a year since it happened until I confided with my second cousin. Her face in shock, but she told me she knew it, and told me that he wasn't really my dad at all.   


I shared this story with that pysch. His smug face instantly changed. I was asked to wait in the lobby and my mom was sent in. Not very long after she sat next to me with tears in her eyes muttering, ""I fucking told him if he did anything like that to you I'd fucking kill him and chop his dick off"". She asked me if it were true...I sat there so ashamed of myself for my mom to know that about me..about him, about...that. I burst into to tears and hugged her. It was the first time I heard my mom say anything protective of me like that...it was so alien. I was scared though so we cried huddled in that lobby. The next day things became different.   
Things were turning serious and my mom went from protector to siding with him. ""How could you lie about something like that, do you really hate your dad THAT much to put him in jail his whole life""?!?!?! My mom yelled at me, him crying, ""How could you do this to me, \*my name\* do you really hate me that much to say something so disgusting""?? My sisters were there they all started crying as my mom hugged them, ""Do you want us to become homeless, your sisters could be taken away""! My sisters cried and yelled at me saying how I could rip the family apart and how their dad was so nice perfect and how well he treats them..  


To this day I still have the most conflicted feelings. Was it really that big a deal...

I was recorded and asked repeatedly about where he touched me..for two weeks I was interviewed and recorded. Those adults telling me it's okay to feel ashamed and what matters most is me...I told them it wasn't true, but they kept persisting that it's okay that it was important so he doesn't do it to me or potentially my sisters. ..My mom alienated me, my grandparents were ashamed of me saying, ""Sometimes it's just better to keep your mouth shut and things within the family, look what you've gone and done""...  


After two weeks I told those court people, I made it all up, I just wanted attention, I'm a liar.

&amp;#x200B;

  
Even my grandparents resented me...my mom spread the news about me to all my family...I couldn't stand that pain...  
I feared what would become of my sisters and my mom as she was on disability and we would be homeless.   


I don't know if what I did was the right thing..  
To this day my mom still calls him, ""your father"" and he still calls me ""his first daughter""...every now and then I still say things like, ""when I was a kid my mom and dad..."" and I get so confused and conflicted. I tried to bring it up to my mom and how it's tearing me and my life apart, and she tells me she doesn't know what I'm talking about. I've asked my sisters, but they brush it off too. I mean he did just by my sister an suv for her birthday. Nothing new, he's always spoiled them and my mom with gifts. He's offered to help pay for my school or buy me a car too, and even though I'm struggling living on my own, I'd rather that than ever take a penny from him.  


I've always had a tough time making friends. It's only ever gotten worse. I once shared a bit of my dark life in a mock therapy session in a community psych class, and I mentioned how angry I am, my professor said she could see that, my art professor nodded in agreement when I said I'm so angry that sometimes I can't even paint. I haven't shared myself like that in a long time, but I bet that anger seeps to the surface. I bet that's why I can't be happy, have friends or like my job...I don't understand why anger though...I get depression sure, but anger? Was it the violence? How my mom wish I wasn't born, how I choked her when she held a knife to me? Am I really that fucked up and damaged that I can't ever be happy again?  


Is there any real hope for me?  
I'm so tired of trying to be strong to keep on working, going to school, being a responsible person.   
I can't even make sense of my childhood and here I am 24, I don't even know who I am. I'm so tired. I can't keep up this positive attitude, this selfless act. I printed out notes for my classmates in Chinese who didn't have a textbook, I take notes for a disabled student who honestly just sits in class on his phone the whole time, I often take on crap projects at work that none others will do and will do my best to keep a cheerful disposition...but that's not me. No, I'm bitter, broken, mean, angry, sad..  


How can I expect to have a real future, to stop eating to the point I need to throw up, at 24 I feel sick everyday, I cry every week? I used to have anger tantrums (three holes in the walls prove that) but my bf has been so patient with me they've become uncommon. But, it isn't his job to take care of that, that's my job! I don't want to be like my mom, she threw lamps and knives at her ""spouse"" for the smallest of things. I fear that I'd be like her. I don't want that. Some days I get so angry I grit my teeth so bad it hurts. I have a tick where I tense my shoulders and I'm not quite sure what causes it other than anger and stress, but it's so often it severely hurts.   


Out of everything, why have I chosen anger?   


Some nights I pray that I''ll die in my sleep. I won't have to live another day in mental agony. No more depression, no more anger, no more highs or lows.   


I always wanted to live life to the fullest, to make the best of what wonders this world has to offer despite the bad, but I'm tired of believing in that. I'm tired of trying to stay happy. It's such a facade.   


I need help..I've gone twice to a therapist. Every time I go I end up feeling so low I skip classes, I cry, I avoid all contact and I over indulge. I've tried boxing classes to help alleviate that anger, but there are weeks I give up.   


Why did I have to be born into the world like this? Why couldn't my mom just have aborted me like she says she wished she had?

aqdiy3,Ex (31f) still causing issues for me (36m),"So, I mentioned before that my ex is emotionally abusive, and shes back on the same coast as I am, and living in our home town.  Today I found out that she claimed my sons on her taxes when she hadn't seen them in over a year, and received something to the tune of 9500 dollars.  She gave 3500 to the trashy friend of hers that helped her pull it off, and spent the rest on drugs, parties, and ditching her 3rd kids dad to move back to our hometown w the baby she essentially ran off with, having never informed her ex she was leaving.  Thats the dude she dated after me.

&amp;#x200B;

I also found out shes been lying to california and washington state collecting food stamp money for my children, who only live w me, whom I pay for, solely.  Neither of us have custody, but her ex (the guy after me) is encouraging me to push for custody.  He claims she gave their child drugs, when he was teething.  He says she flatly refused to let him rub a bit of rum on the baby's teeth while he was teething, and instead insisted on using kief... a marijuana extract that happens to be fairly potent... its also powdery, so Im not sure how she thought it was appropriate in any measure.

&amp;#x200B;

She has presented herself to me as a reformed person, but immediately started dating a man who slapped her sister around, and abused her sisters special needs kids.  I warned her about the guy, because I know him personally.  She says her sister deserved the slaps, and when confronted about the kids he abused she simply said, ""Everyone deserves a second chance to change themselves"", as if that excuses physically abusing handicapped children.

&amp;#x200B;

Im torn, because I dont want to be the bad guy here and have my children resent me.  My parents didn't handle their divorce well, and they played me against one another from age 3 - 12.  I dont want that life for my sons.  I dont want them to be in and out of court rooms.  Hell, I dont want that life for me, either.  But Im worried she'll attempt to pull something slick and snatch my kids.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know I recently posted about this... but the issue has continued to unfold, and I'm really at a loss for how to approach all of this.  Any advice is welcome and appreciated.  Thanks!",JustopianAmbassador,2019-02-13 16:13:08,4,425,30.73,81.44,13.39,15.79,17.71,16,86.35,56.94,22.35,17.65,7.76,0.71,0,7.76,1.41,4.71,4.71,13.41,7.53,5.88,8.24,2.12,15.76,3.06,2.35,1.88,1.41,1.41,4.94,2.12,2.82,0.24,1.88,0.24,21.18,2.12,1.18,6.35,3.29,9.65,1.65,1.65,1.41,1.65,0.94,2.82,1.41,0.24,0.94,0.24,2.82,0.71,1.65,0,0.47,5.41,2.82,0.24,1.65,0.24,0.71,4.71,8.71,0.24,11.29,2.12,4.94,4.94,0.47,0.94,0.47,1.18,0.24,0,1.65,0.24,0,0,0.24,0,20,6.59,6.12,0,1.88,0,0.24,0.24,0.47,1.18,1.41,1.88
aqdyi5,I’m confused and worried,"Okay so I’m 14 (turned fourteen in January), and I feel like this might play a role in my potentially ignorant attitude, so I’m just putting that out there.

I have a tendency to exaggerate everything I say so I’m just going to shut the fuck up this time and say it as it is. Not exaggerated. At all.

My dad works away during the week - he always has, so we only see him on weekends, and because he’s not used to our ‘chaotic home’ (not quoting anyone, but there’s always something we can do to improve it i.e. spending the weekend cleaning, organising stuff, the norm) he gets stressed when he comes home. Especially when it’s particularly messy. I live with my stay-at-home mum and four sisters so he’s outnumbered to be fair. 

Because of that, he can get angry. He’s rarely angry, but when he is, it’s fucking scary. Like, Jesus. He doesn’t usually get enraged when my mum’s home but it gets bad on the weekends that she goes away, most commonly when she needs to leave for dental procedures, it just gets too much for him and he gets really angry. This is almost every time she leaves the house. Which again, is rare, but it happens. 

Most recently I can remember my dad standing at the bottom of the stairs yelling his voice raw for my 11 year old little sister to come back downstairs (which she didn’t do, he’s obviously going to grab her and hit her or just grab her and yell in her face - he has a track record of that), so he got mad as shit and ran upstairs and stood outside her door yelling that he was going to kick it down. Now, when I’ve told people about this I’ve always told them that he actually did kick it down and proceeded to hit her when he got inside (because I’m a disgusting, lying little shit) but I don’t actually know if he did. I do have an [audio recording](https://youtu.be/PZqqgow213M) of him standing outside of my little sister’s door (two corridors and a small staircase away) yelling at her about it, and you can hear repeated kind of odd snap noises I guess? I don’t know if that was him hitting the door to further intimidate her or him genuinely kicking the door but it was scary as shit either way which is why I didn’t get involved. Maybe I’m just a scaredy-cat, I don’t know.

The other time, my other little sister was being a smart-mouth and he decided to chase her down in the garden (this was ages ago), and when he finally couldn’t keep up with her, he came back home and laughed because my little sister was crying and she ‘wasn’t even the one in trouble’, and then just moved on.

Those are the two worst ones I can recall from 2018. Probably some of the only ones too.

There were a few incidents in the other houses we’ve lived in (18 for me I think? Well over 40 for my older sisters, it’s insane) but I can’t remember them very well. I remember my dad getting angry at me about something and me just up and leaving the townhouse we were in in the middle of the night, until my friend who was texting me at the time convinced me to come home. I might’ve just been being a drama queen, WHO KNOWS.

Most recent one was when I was up at 3am playing guitar (quietly) and he got very angry at this and raised his voice at me in the middle of the night. I guess I woke him up. It wasn’t that loud but he put on that oh-shit-gonna-get-hit voice of his that made me instantly shut up at cry myself to sleep until 4 because it’s not violent but the history it’s associated with is scary. It’s the same voice he puts on every time he’s hit us in the past. Which again, isn’t often, BUT LOUD VOICES SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF ME NOW.

I texted him about controlling his temper, and he forwarded that to my mum, and she answered him saying that ‘they don’t have a brother, so they don’t understand how angry a man can get’ because she has a severely physically abusive brother when she was young and said the same thing to me, essentially discrediting everything I’m upset about, and we moved on. My dad has since been messaging me defending his side of the story.

Oh also the most memorable part of that 3am thing was that he came in, made a face and went ‘Willow, this is *sick*’ and THEN got angry. That really hit me hard.

Anyway, everyone online says that he’s an abusive dad, but is he? If it’s that rare, is he really? He’s not abusive to my mum, if anyone it’s me and my sisters. I don’t know anymore. I don’t believe the people online because of my mum’s opinion, but I don’t believe my mum’s opinion because of the people online.

aqe5zg,*sigh* My mother is a raging sociopath PART ONE,"There were more things that went on, I could write a novel, but this is just a summery. 

I was born in the early 90's, exactly 9 month after my parents had gotten married. My dad was already having his doubts about the marriage but coming from a broken home himself, wanted to stick with it. From the very beginning my mother was very controlling and protective of me. From what I ate, to what I wore, to who got to hold me, to ho got to be near me. Everything had to be just so and no one cold tell her otherwise. My dad had little to no say. She constantly took pictures of me and filmed me. I was always dressed up fancy from the day I was born and this would continue on for years. According to my grandmother, I was not allowed to even have mashed potatoes until I was 2, that is unless she gave them to me behind my mother's back. When I was only 6 moths, my mom had my ears pierced. My grandmother was there and said I screamed for about an hour. My first word was ""mommy"". Dad worked all the time, he drove trucks and could be gone for days on end. My mother was my world. They fought all the time and mom made me take her side. She made sure I played in a way she liked. I had dolls, and tea sets, only quiet toys that did not make noises. If my dad gave me a toy truck, or if I wanted to play with my cousin's toy tractors, mom would swiftly come in and tell me not to play with the boyish toys, even if I was trying to make Barbie drive the tractor. As a toddler and small child, my mom dressed me in poofy dresses that had to have 2 petty coats underneath, and stalkings, and buckled shoes. She curled my hair every day. On some occasions she even put make-up on me. I looked like a doll. I looked like a grown woman sometimes. Everyone would say ""Oh what a pretty girl, you're such a good mother."" and she'd bask in the glory. She taught me to not talk to strangers. Strangers were anyone she had not given me permission to talk to, even people we went to church with, even family members. She told me that I did not have to listen to any adult but her. When I started school, that caused problems. I have a hard time for other reasons. I was often late to class because she took so long getting me ready. I couldn't play in my nice dresses. I wasn't used to being around so many other children. If I misbehaved in public, sh'd take me to the bathroom and spank me with a wooden cooking spoon. If I refused to go quietly when she said ""Come with me, I have a surprise for you."" she'd hit me twice as many times. If I misbehaved in school, she'd spank me and also make me sit on the fireplace and not move for 5 minutes. If I so much as coughed, it started over.  I began playing sports. Mom came to all my practices and inserted herself in the circle of moms. She always had a bottle of ""mommy juice"" with her. I accidentally took a sip one day and spit it out. The moms asked her to not come anymore. I wasn't allowed to go if she couldn't, so I didn't get to do sports anymore. Some times, usually 2-3 times a week, we'd go to the neck county to buy ""mommy-juice"", right after she picked me up from school. Because it was so far, I had to do my homework in the car. She bought a horse. She bought a horse and we did not have anywhere to keep it. My dad had some friends who had property, and she had to pay rent to them to keep her freeking horse there, but she also had to care for it herself. So everyday we went there too, and stayed for hours, sometimes all day. She wouldn't feed me on those days. If I didn't pack a lunch, I wouldn't eat until we got home that night. I became more like a servant to her, mixing her drinks and making her food, doing her laundry and cleaning her bathroom. Dad was called off to go fight in Iraq. We ran out of food. We had money, she just didn't want to go shopping. She made up a new rule to keep me from misbehaving in school. She'd spank me before going, 5 times, and if I moved it started over. If I did misbehave, she'd hit me 10 times, and I'd get 10 the next morning. Sometimes she'd throw in a ""one to grow on"" for fun. She found out she was pregnant. She miscarried. According to my other grandma, she'd overdosed on drugs. She had to sell her horse when dad came home on medical leave. He found out about the morning spankings and told her to stop.  Dad had to have surgery, and went back to the war. She went back to the parties and bringing home strange men and drinking. Once summer, she had my older cousin come stay with us so she could go party and my cousin would stay home with me. There was little food and mom would hardly buy me cloths anymore. She no longer took pictures of me. She still picked out my cloths and told me who I could and couldn't talk to. She began to inspect me. To make sure I was ""developing"" as I should. When dad came home for good, it was found out she'd spent all the money and put us into debt. She still bought all the makeup she wanted and hair coloring and booze. I wore her old cloths and even her panties because she wouldn't buy me any. I got into trouble in middle school gym because I wasn't wearing a bra and that made the other girls uncomfortable for some reason. Mother bought me a ratty old one from goodwill. One morning on the way to school, I complained about the outfit she made me put on, and she punched me in the face. She told me that dad had wanted her to get an abortion when she was pregnant with me. She mourned he loss of her unborn child that she'd miscarried and ignored me. She still brought strange people over. Some stole from us. She inspected me more through, asked me if any boys had touched me down there. When she flirted with me in public, she'd push me well out of the way and tell me to go somewhere else. She liked to dress me like a trashy slut, even to school. I was made to change into sweats all the time because she'd refuse to bring me different cloths. She'd beat me for it. She used her fist to wail on me, but never where a bruise would show, and drag me down by my hair and burn me with the curling iron on my ears. For no reason, she'd sit on my chest until I couldn't breath, and lick my entire face while holding me down as I screamed and cried. If I brought a boy home, she'd come out in a skimpy outfit and flirt with them. Any gal pals I brought home, she'd praise and reward to make me jealous. While she no longer picked out my cloths, I had little, only 5-6 shirts and 2 pairs of jeans. Any new cloths that I got, she'd take for herself, even if they didn't fit her. I took over cooking and cleaning the whole house. I rode my bike to the store for groceries. She like to slam me into walls and push me around if I did something wrong. In high school, she'd stay gone for days. The lights and water were always being shut off because she did god know's what with the money for the bills. She made sure I was not shaving my legs or anything else. She made sure I was still a virgin. Dad was working 3 jobs. She stayed at home. Dad went and searched her room and found needles and bags of unknown powder. We left not long after.

aqehfa,Am I having normal teen issues?,"I’m 17 years old. I live in a “nuclear family”, with Dad, Mom, and Sister. 2 dogs. I don’t know how to describe what’s going on so Ill try with a series of anecdotes. 

Sometimes being at home is fine. But especially in the last 2 years, I’m struggling to live in my house. 

Our vacations are a strained week of 4 people fighting. I left our last summer outing wishing I had been allowed to stay home or that we had never left at all. 

My application to college was miserable—my mom talks constantly about how excited she is for me to leave, my Dad thinks I wasted high school and failed to be an Ivy League admit due to swim team and my friends. My mom thought I was taking all my furniture and that I wouldn’t be coming home for Thanksgiving or Christmas. 

My whole family ( including 13 year old sister), belittles and sometimes humiliates me in front of peers and adults about wearing makeup. My dad thinks I can’t succeed in my career if I wear makeup and tells me so constantly. My mom consistently mocks me about putting on makeup or being interested in makeup and says I “waste all my time watching beauty YouTube”. ( I watch YouTube the same way most kids my age do, I think).

My room isn’t my space. I find clothes missing that my mom has taken, my dad constantly tries to fix my blinds or blankets despite the fact that I’m 17. I’m constantly bothered about where I am in the house. 

My parents yell at me at home. They yell at me in front of my friends. I remember my mom fetching me from a friends house down the street by entering and screaming at me in front of her family. She did the same in middle school while giving a neighbor boy a ride home, using fuck in front of an 11 year old and the rest of the parking lot. My dad has chased me into my room where I have to remain for the rest of an evening or day. I have been hit. Neither has ever apologized. Ever. Not for yelling, not for saying something snide or rude or cruel. Not for hitting me. I have been told I’m acting entitled, or whining, or making it up. “Drama queen,” or “princess”. 

I’m not allowed to have friends over. I can count the number of times a friend has been allowed to sleep at my home on one hand. It’s not that I’m not allowed to date, but I’m so afraid of bringing anyone home to meet my parents I haven’t had a boyfriend. 

Our house is slovenly, despite being in an upper middle class neighborhood. My mother stays at home but yells at me upon coming home about how I don’t do anything to deserve my “privilege.” I cook 7 nights a week. 

But I live in such comfort. I have a car to drive to school. My parents scream at me for spending money, but asked me not to get a job so I could keep my grades up. I have clothes and a new backpack and an iPhone. Sometimes I feel really close to my dad. I can’t tell my friends what’s going on, I live in such a nice house and try to be as happy and peppy as I can for them.  I love making people laugh, I love being close with my teachers. 

Yet I’m struggling to get up in the morning. Makeup isn’t fun anymore, I just need the routine. I don’t want to see anybody. I’m tired of school and I’m beginning to hate my teachers and classmates. I have two friends. I’m sure it’s senioritis or something but I just feel like I’m going crazy recently.",yikessplash,2019-02-13 17:54:34,2,647,42.78,11.71,99,10.25,13.2,14.37,93.2,55.49,18.7,16.23,14.84,0.62,0,0.46,0.31,2.47,4.64,14.37,9.89,4.33,6.8,2.78,19.63,3.71,1.55,1.08,1.55,1.08,5.87,2.32,3.55,0.93,1.85,0.62,10.51,3.25,1.85,2.16,1.24,12.36,1.55,1.55,0.93,3.71,1.39,5.26,2.78,0.77,1.55,0.46,2.63,0.93,1.08,0.15,0.15,9.12,4.17,1.08,3.55,0.93,0.15,2.47,13.45,0.93,17.16,2.32,9.12,6.03,2.63,1.7,3.4,0.31,0.15,0,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0,16.69,7.42,2.94,0,0,0.15,0,0,1.55,4.02,0.62,0

aqoe7x,"I don’t know what do do anymore, the stuff I put up with makes me feel like a zoo animal, I’m scared to do anything about it.","My moms had a boyfriend for about 8 years, I turned 20 just a few months ago, for reference. He was weirdly attached to my sister who’s about 9 now, when she was a baby, he was unspreable, I remember my mom always said how great she was with her, when I thought it was uncanny that he payed way more attention to my sibling then her. He started having weird people over I was about 12 or 13, and It’s foggy but I remember I started to get really uncomfortable from their on and cut ties with my mom and moved into my grandmas for a few years, once she went to Vegas, I think I was 14, and rob had my little sister. He came over and was straight twacked out and said there was bees everywhere in the house, and went into my room into my grandmas house, as I had the only computer in my house, I walked into my room and he started calling me names, throwing stuff at me, and I woke up my grandma crying, she chased him down the street. 
I moved around a lot, back in and back out. She’d always put him before me. She’d buy him new shoes when I’d have no winter coat. Or boots. She’d forget to pick me up from school etc etc. He left for a while, and my life improved greatly honestly. I was about 16–17 and he came back when I was 17 and was more into drugs. I came back after doing some reckless/ impulsive / living on my own for a few years and came back at 19. Her boyfriend has been around and has been smoking meth in the house for about a year, I find spoons parfinula, and I always have nausea shakes, and my partial seizures have gotten worse, I ask her why she lets him back in after he abuses her. And she’s tells me to fuck off , shut the fuck up constaly.i just simplily ask her why. I don’t question why she wants to live like this, and why she allows it, and why she’s okay that I feel uncomfortable in my own house.

I am a 19-year-old gay male from the US. My abuser is my boyfriend (also from the US), who has severe anger issues and will go from incredibly loving to verbally violent in an instant. He is incredibly vulgar, referring to me in a slew of defamatory names and cherry-picking traits about me to insult. However, he has recently been more abusive. He has started threatening physical violence against, on today of all days (Valentine's day), he threatened to take me to a remote location and to have his friend kill me with a shotgun so that he wouldn't get his hands dirty. He's now crying his eyes out in a call and apologising to me, but i have no idea what to do. I'm scared for my life, but also scared of breaking his heart. I'm not looking for legal action, I just want this nightmare to end with either him getting therapy and rehabilitating himself, or me somehow finding the courage to break up with him.

My current boyfriend seemed like a total sweetheart, but I’ve acknowledged that he’s had some struggles with his emotions. He dealt with a similar past as me. I thought I was safe with him. He just gets so, so cold and angry. He gets almost cruel. I make him upset and he breaks me down so quickly with his words. I never thought he’d hit me, though. Today was the first time he’s shown it so badly. Instead of words, he hit the bed around me, sprayed air freshener in my face, and brought up a fist to hit me. He didn’t hit me, but he was very close. 

I love him but I can’t do this. I really can’t do this. It sent me into a panic attack and of course he blames it all on me. It’s my fault. I “shouldn’t be condescending.” I don’t even know what he means. I don’t know what I did wrong. It hurts so bad, emotionally.

fast forward to five minutes ago. hes talking to one of his many girlfriends, and i overheard him telling a story from about 16 years ago. its a pretty cool story, i have to admit. but one part of the story stood out to me. him and his friends had cocaine in their car.

of course, this was 16 years ago. so nothing affected me. though, im afraid he has a lot of keys and is still addicted. he doesnt show any signs, but im still nervous.

as i stated before, he is severely addicted to nicotine. i dont know if he is using this to get off ? i dont know.

If I leave him, Im scared I'll leave him struggling. 

We've always argued but he's only gotten physical since we moved in together. He slammed my head into a wall so hard I couldn't get out of bed the next day, he's chocked me, he's smashed my laptop screen and cut the cord on my hair straightener and curler. 

The verbal abuse almost seems worse. The one that always comes back to me vividly is ""I wish I could throw you in a meat grinder and kill you"".  Everytime I try to leave he'll turn off my phone and threaten to cancel my car insurance and call the police, so I'll go back to our apartment and he'll convince me he's sorry and he'll change.

aqyjoh,Neighbor may be a victim of domestic violence - not sure what to do,"Hello, I'm looking for advice from the perspective of victims of domestic violence.  I moved to this community a couple years ago, and my neighbor introduced herself as a young newly-wed to a federal law enforcement officer.  Since then, I have been able to hear just about everything that goes on in their apartment.  Walking around, cupboards slamming, furniture being dragged across the floor, enthusiastic sex moans, etc.  It has been annoying.

But last night, and once a couple of weeks ago, I heard something more concerning.  I thought I heard her cry out, ""Someone please help me,"" one evening a few weeks ago, but I wasn't sure enough to check on her.  After all, if it's the sex thing... I don't want to embarrass her. :/  Then, last night around 11PM, she sounded like she might be loudly crying out of fear or pain, but I couldn't distinguish what she was saying.  My husband thought he might have heard her say, ""You're hurting me.""

The sounds she was making last night were different enough from the usual to be concerning, but not clear enough for us to be sure it wasn't just a weirdly passionate Valentine's Day...

I didn't call the police either time, because I am not sure what is happening, and I also read last night that calling the police might put her in further danger if she IS a victim of abuse, especially as the spouse of law enforcement.  We are in a very small community, more than 45 minutes from the nearest shelter/DV resources, and I am worried that she may feel isolated and helpless.

ar12vx,Was I abused? Or just gullible?,"I first started using the Internet when I'd just turned 16. I'd only just got Facebook when a stranger added me, commenting on my prom photos, telling me I was beautiful. I'd never been called beautiful before and was flattered. 

He was friendly, said he was 23, said he went to a university in Texas, and from what I could tell he wasn't catfishing - he did have selfies in front of the University, he did look 23, he did have a legitimate account with lots of friends. No harm in chatting, right? 

As the weeks went on, he told me all about his childhood in India, his fast car, his job, his uni life. He started telling me he was in love with me, and stupidly I believed him.

At some point he began sending messages of a sexual nature. I was unsure, and tried to steer the conversation away, but he was persistent. It was my first foray into anything like that and to be frank it was a bit exciting. I felt grown up, adventurous.

We started sharing webcams not long after that, though he was usually studying so we mostly continued to IM. He told me he was going to tell his family in India about me, that he wanted to marry me someday, things like that.

I remember him asking repeatedly to see me naked, asking me to do things for him on webcam, saying if I loved him, I'd do it. I did them I figured that we were a couple and felt like I owed it to him. He sent me unsolicited dick pics on more than one occasion. I didn't feel violated but I did feel uncomfortable, ashamed.

When my parents inevitably found out, I told them we were in love. They tried their best to stop me talking to him, turning off the WiFi after 6pm, monitoring my laptop, etc, but it didn't deter me.

When my parents then both joined Facebook and became a constant presence in my online life he stopped talking to me almost entirely. I got very upset, especially when he only tried to brush me off - saying he was very busy with uni work, that he didn't think it was a good idea for us to talk so much any more. Then he either deleted his Facebook or blocked me. The whole thing had lasted about 8 months and just like that it was over.

He has made a new Facebook at some point; FWIW he works in IT, raises funds for an animal charity, generally seems like a decent person (though I haven't added him or tried to speak to him).

So... was it some form of abuse? Did he take advantage of me being young and naive? Or, at 16, was the onus on me for not knowing better? I can't tell whether it's just easier for me to consider him an abuser than to admit that I was infatuated, desperate for attention, and gullible. 

If you read all this, thank you - I'd appreciate your opinion.

ar1d6r,how do i tell my mum? [TW: sexual abuse],"throwaway, for obvious reasons. this is going to be a long post, but i'd really appreciate it id you could read it and perhaps respond. this is hard to open up  to even reddit about, also keep in mind my memory about all this is pretty non linear and blurry. 

my father was diagnosed with a brain tumour when i was two. it sounds silly, but i never really realized the severity until the end. he had seizures, he went to hospitals and we had stayed in apartments in london while he got treatment, but to me he was just 'ill'. perpetually. i didn't think much more of it.

his health declined, and when i was 7 or 8 my grandparents moved to our town. i now know this was to help care for my dad, i don't know what i thought then. we'd used to go to their house where they lived before, i always loved it. it had this huge living room with a wine coloured carpet, i used to dance in there. it seems so big in my memory, but i'm sure that has something to do with how young i was. anyway, they moved down. 

my father passed away when i was 8. i can't remember how i felt, maybe my brain blocked it out. anyway, afterwards, my grandad became something of a father figure. we'd never been close before, but he was so kind all of a sudden. he really tried for me, so everyone around me thought. he took me places, bought me things, tried to make my life as fun as possible considering the circumstances.

until, somewhere along the line, that changed. and it's fucking weird, but i don't know when it started. you'd think the first time would be traumatic and burned in my brain, but it's all so hazy. to put it bluntly, from about the age of 9 to the age of maybe 14, he sexually abused me. meanwhile, he carried on with the whole father figure facade. 

i really don't know how to explain the things he's done because it just isn't in order in my mind. he molested me, used my grandma's sex toys on me,  did oral on me, loads of things even worse than that. i hated it so fucking much, but for some reason i was absolutely terrified of anyone finding out. from about the age of 10, i had a deal with myself that if anyone found out, i'd kill myself. i don't know why i was so against anyone finding out, i knew it wasn't my fault. 

anyway, i had a few scares. people nearly found out multiple times, and i lied my way out. do you know how fucking difficult it is to tell a room of police that you lied about this? that you made all this up? i don't know why i said nothing happened. but, with all of those scares. it kind of made me more open to someone knowing. and i'm really ready to tell someone, but i don't know how.

if you're wondering, i'm safe. he actually passed away last year.

i just don't even know how to begin telling my mother. it would break her heart.",throwaway288409,2019-02-15 13:14:47,3,548,11.99,22.72,98.27,8.39,12.45,10.95,95.62,62.59,24.45,16.24,11.31,0.73,1.09,2.55,0.55,8.03,3.28,14.23,9.85,9.67,8.39,2.55,22.08,4.2,1.46,2.74,1.46,2.37,5.29,1.82,3.28,0.55,1.64,0,9.67,1.64,0,0.73,3.47,20.26,6.39,3.47,0.91,4.2,2.37,4.56,1.28,0.36,0.36,0.55,3.83,0.73,1.64,1.09,0.18,4.74,1.28,0.55,2.01,0.36,0.73,9.49,9.67,0.36,14.96,2.19,6.93,5.47,0.36,1.09,0.91,0.18,0,0.18,1.46,0.55,0.18,0.18,0,0.55,20.07,7.3,6.93,0.18,0,0.55,0,0,0,4.74,0,0.36

ar5an1,Is it abuse?,"(my step-father=SF)

Here's a list of some of the worst things SF has done to me and my siblings

\-*(I was 6 or 7 at this time)* **SF locked me in the basement for crying with every light turned off(he knew I was afraid of the dark, I still am, years later)**

\-**Hit us with the belt** *(I know that's relatively normal but I think it's important to this list)*

\-**Picked both me and my brother up by our necks**

\-**Threw me in the tub, demanded to know why I was crying, shook me and splashed cold water on me when I told him I wanted my mom**

**-Grabbed me and all of my siblings by our shoulders and shaken, pushed, or held us while he screamed at us**

\-**Has yelled at my mother like she is a child**

\-**Calls me and my siblings disgusting, lazy, slobs, selfish, greedy, resource-thieves, a waste of his time, useless, hopeless, and all kinds of other things**

\-**SF always finds something wrong with what we do, even if we've done what he asked. (Ex: I cleaned all day today, baked him a cake ((which he asked for)) and had a slice. He got pissed off at me for eating a slice rather than noticing that I had been cleaning nonstop for 6 hours)**

ar8365,Is This Child Abuse? (Re: 6yo Girl &amp; How Her Father Treats Her),"So I am a personal trainer (male, 29yo) that offers in-home personal training. Two of my clients are a husband and wife (both late 30s) that train together twice per week, and the wife an additional one time per week on her own. I initially trained just the wife and when the husband became interested, she made a comment that she preferred to train alone, but the 2 for 1 was more feasible $$$ wise.

&amp;#x200B;

I show up at this home at 6:30am three times per week. Every time I show up, their 6 (just turned 6) year old girl rushes downstairs in an attempt to hang out in the basement with us while I train the parents/just the wife. 

&amp;#x200B;

The very first time the daughter came downstairs, it became obvious that the husband was way, way overbearing. I knew he was a bit of a nutcase after a previous session (initially trained them at 9am, so AFTER the daughter, then 5, got up for school) and he was fuming early in the morning (to the point where i was receiving attitude from him). The wife (who is completely normal) made a comment that he and the daughter were fighting due to him not wanting the daughter to wear a dress to school.

&amp;#x200B;

My initial thought was, OK - not a huge deal on the surface, but shit, she's 5, let her wear whatever (as long as appropriate). But I am NOT a father (i am 29yo), and did not pass judgement and life went on. Fast forward, when we started training at 6:30, the daughter started to wake up super early to come hang out downstairs with us while we trained. The very first time, it became obvious how overbearing the father was (is).. Literally EVERYTHING this little girl does, is criticized:

&amp;#x200B;

* ""if you are going to talk in baby voices, get out""
* ""that's not how you blow your nose.. actually BLOW, or don't do it at all""
* ""if you aren't going to respect our space, get out""

&amp;#x200B;

I heard all three of these within 8 minutes of the very first time she came down. And i could tell the wife was uncomfortable, and the daughter would just freeze. I just played it cool and kept giving training cues to try and divert.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, the daughter remained in a playful/joyful mood, and the session ended on a positive note. After the session in the kitchen (as I prepared to leave for next client), the father randomly opened his arms towards the daughter and went for a hug. She completely resisted, and then hugged the mother.

&amp;#x200B;

This pattern went on for a few weeks. I just treated the daughter as I would any 5 year old (now 6). Never pushing the engagement, but would interact when she was/is playful, ""how's school"", ""do you enjoy your swimming lessons"", etc. But never anything over the top.

Over time she began to get very attached to ME. ""I love you"". Always trying to hug me (insanely awkward when the father is right there, who she flat out will not hug), and there is no affection at all between the two (or between the husband and wife for that matter).

I just take it as, ""she's 5"" - nothing out of the ordinary there as far as her getting attached to another adult that shows her kindness.

This has gone on for about a year now, and still when she comes downstairs, the father is criticizing her every move AND sound. If she even makes a sound, he will snap at her and threaten:

* ""play in your head!"" (not kidding, he says this)
* ""one more time and you have to go upstairs""

Now mind you, she isn't over the top. It is completely normal 5-6 year old behavior. She will swing on the gymnastics rings and say ""weeeeeee"" like any little kid. This drives him nuts. He fumes at the sound of his now 6 year-old daughters voice (WHILE she is having fun).

There was an incident where their 14 year old dog ate a breakfast muffin that the daughter left unattended on the weight bench while we trained. The husband FLIPPED (again, it's 6:45ish in the morning).

""IS NO ONE PAYING ATTENTION?!""

He was just livid .. the daughter ran upstairs, and he even gave the poor dog a little smack upside the head (not hard, but cmon, it is NEVER the dog's fault for getting into human food.. and she's 14 ffs).

Another thing I noticed, when I tell the daughter not to do something (in a completely calm tone), such as:

* ""not yet &lt;daughter's name&gt;, we are still using that"" (when she went to take a collar off a barbell)
* or simply ""don't do that"" (but again, in a calm and friendly tone (when she was just taking dumbbells off the rack and placing them on the floor in a pile)

I've gotten two responses.. The first is, she just freezes as if I yelled at her. In which I assured her I wasn't upset or anything. The second is, (and she has said this twice now):

""You aren't my daddy, you can't tell me what to do"" (lmao.. i just laugh and I don't disagree, but it throws me off a bit as my tone is so so calm as opposed to the father who just snaps)

The father regularly will make up excuses why the daughter comes downstairs so early:

* ""when you turn on the fan in the bathroom (when I pee after I arrive), it wakes her up so she comes down""
* ""she is woken up by the weights clinging""
* etc

The mother has interjected and literally said:

&amp;#x200B;

""No, that's not true. She just really loves you. She gets excited the night before when I tell her you are coming.""

&amp;#x200B;

So this has made it super, super awkward to train this family. The mother is super cool, seems completely normal, but the father is a wack job. And I feel like I am experiencing verbal abuse. I will just throw a few more instances, so ya's get more of an idea of what I see:

&amp;#x200B;

* One day, the daughter came downstairs right when we started training, and before she opened her mouth, the father made a critical remark.. the daughter's response ""I was just coming down to say 'good morning' ""
* Daughter walks up behind me sometimes and legit just grabs my butt.. or she picks up the deadlift wedge and starts smacking me in the butt with it. 
* I mentioned zero affection between husband and wife. But the husband will occasionally smack her on the butt or make inappropriate comments about her boobs. Shit that i HATE and find super disrespectful. He is essentially trying to impress me with this too. Much of what he says/does is an attempt to impress me (with his MANLINESS), but you can see the inner softy right through it. And there is nothing I say or do that warrants/suggests I like/approve of this behavior. 
* Sometimes when he keeps flipping on the daughter, she runs upstairs upset. And if he chases after her to tell her she can come back down if she behaves, the wife makes small comments to me such as, ""these two go at it all day"". And I have responded with ""you got to pick your battles"", but that is as far as I have gone as far as speaking up. She agrees, and occasionally tells him to knock it off. In which he will just respond: ""No, she HAS to learn!""
* Was talking with the father one day while I trained only him. I made a comment about kids not appreciating their parents (but I wasn't referring to a friggin 6 year old - i meant like mid-late teens and even said appreciation doesn't come to later in life), and he starts going off about his situation with the daughter. Literally said ""I am not enjoying this"".
* When I train just the mother and the daughter comes down, she is a whirlwind. Super hyper. One day while the mother was deadlifting and I was watching the mother from the front, the little girl ran up behind the mother, and essentially started twerking (I guess she has seen it on TV or the IPAD they let her use). But it was super odd/a bit uncomfortable to see a 6 year old doing that. I guess this could be harmless though?
* That same day as prior bullet, daughter was just rambling and said something along lines of ""mommy is a porn"" and then just stopped the sentence. I said in a joking manner ""hey, where did you learn that word?"". And she responded ""I made it up"" (but you could tell she was fibbing) 

&amp;#x200B;

My primary concern isn't the past few bullets. Or how the daughter attached to me. I have seen plenty of little kids attach to adults/other older kids. My concern is how the father criticizes literally everything this little girl says and does.

All I do is think inside, ""dude, she's fucking six years old ... shes SIX! .. just let her be a kid.. let her play while we train.. let her talk in 'baby voices'.. let her swing on the rings and say 'weeeeee' .. that is completely normal 6 year old behavior in this environment.""

I want to say something so bad - but worry the husband will shut the whole thing down if I do (and it is nice income). The husband and wife are both absolutely killing it as far as progress. The wife would train 7 days a week if they had the funds. The feedback from a training perspective has been amazing and I couldn't be happier from that perspective.

As someone that was never abused, or seriously bullied, etc, is something super wrong here? Overbearing parent or child abuse? I feel like this kid is going to grow up super fucked due to the insane criticism and zero affection from the father. This guy regularly fights with his 6 year old girl.. 99% of fathers I see with 6 year old girls are in total love.

At the very least, I know this family needs therapy. But I know if I say it to them both, he will act out. And if I say it to just the wife, she will bring it up, and he will squeeze it out of her that I said it. I know this isn't my business, but I spend 4 hours with this family every week. And the more this happens, the more it is on my mind (and I don't want this shit on my mind).

TLDR: Father of 6 year old girl angrily criticizes her every move and sound. When he acts out against her, he seems more like the 6 year old. Her behavior just gets more and more rebellious. Meanwhile, daughter has gotten over the top attached to me when I show up - this is making my business (in home personal training) super awkward (I train husband and wife multiple times per week, and daughter comes downstairs at 6:30am to hang out with us).

Thx, sorry for huge post .. no one I can tell that can relate to potential abuse, nor can I relate.

are702,Am I being emotionally abused?,"Sorry this is kind of a long post, but I really don't know where to turn at this point. 

In general my parents are pretty nice to me. I cant afford to move out right now and they're letting me live in the house and not pay rent so I can save money.  But they think that my mental issues are all because I'm a selfish person. 

I've had issues with self harm and still struggle with an eating disorder, as well as depression and anxiety (all self diagnosed until I can get to a psychologist). My mom has had the exact same issues but still insists that I just need to pray more, and be more charitable.

So I helped a coworker get a new ps4, that's charitable right? No that was just because I want to have sex with him. I would give my coworkers rides home sometimes, but that was also wrong because it would make people think I was ""sinning"" with those guys. 

They hate that my friends aren't Christians, and since I don't ""share the gospel"" with them I shouldn't be associating with them. They've never explicitly forbidden me from hanging out with them, so I still do, but every time I do my parents criticize them. 

The first time I self harmed, my parents saw the cuts and my dad told me ""if you want to kill yourself it's down the street, not across the road"". My mom insists that he was joking but that made it so much worse. When they found out I was starving myself, my mom said I was as bad as a murderer.

 Before I lost a bunch of weight my dad would make fun of me for being fat. He also joked about my big boobs a lot. Now he makes fun of my eating habits a lot, like asking how many calories certain things are in a weird, joking way. 

They tend to pressure me into doing things I know I won't like at work. At my last job they would constantly tell me that I needed to be a manager, then when I took the position and it didn't work out, they forced me to quit. I loved that job and I regret leaving, but they're glad I don't work there because I can't see my friends as often. 

They're also obsessed with making sure that my beliefs are the same as theirs, and if they aren't I'm not a Christian. When I want to do anything with my appearance I have to check with them first and if they don't like it I'm not allowed to do it. 

But I'm not sure if these things are issues or if that's just how parents are and I should just get over it. I think that they are but I'm worried that I'm just being an angsty teen and blaming them for all my problems. So idk what to do.",trash15739,2019-02-16 15:02:12,0,497,7.37,13.42,78.6,12.45,19.12,11.47,96.98,63.98,23.74,17.71,13.08,0,0.4,0.8,3.42,6.04,4.63,11.07,12.47,6.24,10.66,3.82,20.32,5.23,2.62,1.41,0.4,2.21,8.65,3.82,4.83,1.01,1.21,0.8,10.87,1.81,0.6,0.6,1.41,15.69,1.61,2.82,3.62,2.62,2.01,5.23,1.01,0.6,0.2,0.2,2.01,0.4,0.6,0.4,1.01,6.64,1.81,1.41,1.81,0.8,0.8,4.02,14.89,0.6,10.26,0.8,4.83,4.43,2.21,1.41,0.6,1.01,1.21,0.4,0.6,0.2,0.2,0,0.2,0.2,15.49,4.83,3.42,0,0,0.4,0,0,1.21,5.23,0.4,0

arggi9,Remembering,"Almost 10 years ago now, I baby sat for my cousin and her husband. We are about 10 years apart, I was still in high school.
They went out to eat, I watched her two kids, and spent the night because we were all going to Santas Village the next day. When they got home, she went to bed and her husband came downstairs where I was and we watched some wrestling. He had a few beers and a few I mean the big 40 oz beers, and he put those back quick. We were sitting on the couch and he started massaging my back and neck, I kinda looked at him like ""wtf are you doing"" he started kissing my neck and touched my breasts and thats when I got up and just looked at him. He quickly apologized, freaked out and went upstairs. 
We never said a word to each other after that nor discussed it. I babysat a few more times and spent the night, only once when i spent the night did he come out of the bedroom in the middle of the night stark naked to go to the bathroom, but of course walks by the open door.
Fast forward ten years later, I see them almost every weekend at the restaurant they own together. She has NO IDEA, I think it would kill her, and he just looks at me like, I'm not sure, guilty, idk.
I want to talk to him about it. I haven't forgotten it, how could he? Or maybe he did and I'm overreacting. 
Of all the shit I've been through that was the least of it, but the fact that we just pushed it aside and pretended nothing happened is now bothering me.  

Tonight it is just extra bothering me..so I figured I'd ask for some advice.

argyls,I don’t know if I have the strength to leave.,"I’m a 23f engaged to a 31m. We met online and we’ve been together for close to three years, known each other for five. It started out good. Really good. And it still is really good. But sometimes he snaps.

It started with him just screaming at me for hours when I did something that set him off. Then it escalated to shoving and screaming in my face. For the last few months it’s gotten worse to the point of physical violence. Pushing, shoving, squeezing, hitting. He squeezed me so tight in a rage that I had back pain for a week. My head is still throbbing from how he slapped and pulled my hair last night. 

My problem is common for abuse survivors. He’s very kind and loving when he’s not in a rage, which makes it hard for me to tear myself away. He’s my best friend. I just want the abuse to stop, but I don’t want to lose him. 

I know it’s not going to stop. I know it’s most likely going to get worse. I know I’m putting myself in danger. 

But it’s hard to leave for a million reasons and I don’t know how to get past them. I don’t want to lose our cat, who was his to begin with. I don’t want to face the shame and embarrassment of not only a broken relationship, but a broken engagement. I don’t know how to tell my friends and family. 

Above all, I’m scared of being single. I feel like no one would love me the same way. I’m very ugly and fat and lucky to be in a relationship at all. I’m scared of putting myself back out there again. 

Another important point is that I moved to another country to be with him. I’m all alone and have nowhere to go. 

I know these are stupid reasons in the grand scheme of things. But wow are they momentous barriers to overcome. What have your experiences with this stuff been like?

Since birth, my parents never let me leave my house for socializing purposes. I am not allowed to meet up with my friends outside of school. I’ve never been to the movies with my friends, or shopping, or doing any activity. Everything always had to be alone and with my parents. There’s a strip mall right beside my high school my parents never consented to me going out for lunch alone or with my friends. They always told me that I wasn’t allowed to leave the school building at all. 

Even on my birthdays, I was never allowed to invite my friends over or spend any time with them. My parents always invited their own friends and their children over for me to spend my birthday with. My parents never liked it if I received gifts or even any simple items from my friends at school. As I got older, I learned to hide any items which I would receive from my classmates. 

I’ve also never been allowed to have any social media. I have many social media’s now, however my parents don’t know about any of them. My parents consider almost everything in this world to be “dangerous”. My parents are so overprotective to the point that they won’t even let me go to school on my own, or even step outside of my house without their supervision. 

For many years, my social interaction with my peers had always been extremely limited. Now, the only way I communicate with them is at school or via text. My parents don’t know about this and I’m grateful that my parents don’t check my phone. My mother is extremely nosy, but thankfully, she hasn’t asked to check my phone for many years now. 






I’m now going to share another very important piece of my life which greater reveals the circumstances under which I have lived while with my parents. 






My mother is extremely verbally, emotionally and sometimes physically abusive, and has always been that way, my father too sometimes. Everything from my grades, my personality, my interests, and especially my weight have been topics which have always been targets for insults by my mother. I am not obese, per say, however I am overweight. And I’m not denying it. However, it isn’t affecting my health whatsoever, nor any of my abilities. I started gaining weight around grade 7, and my mother has been criticizing my appearance ever since. I am also darker skinned than both my parents, despite being their biological child. My mother has also expressed her displeasure in the colour of my skin. 

My mother’s constant degrading lowered my self-esteem and self-worth to the point where it was almost non-existent. I hated my body for many years, and have only recently began to like my appearance. 

I’ve endured the abuse for many years, and I’m afraid that if I stay for any longer with my parents, I might start losing my  sanity. For years, I stayed silent and never talked back to my parents, when I was a young child and also in my early teens. Around the age of 14, I started to defend myself and my actions and beliefs. My mother started calling me disrespectful and saying that I was misbehaving. 

Years of conflicts and arguments have taken an enormous strain on the relationship I have with my mother. 

My mother most certainly has a personality disorder, however she has never been properly tested. Both my father and I have experienced many challenges while living with her. 

My mother is extremely controlling, and over the years has also influenced my father to become this way as well. For as long as I can remember, they’ve always emotionally blackmailed me, and guilt-tripped me into doing things which I didn’t want to do, or wasn’t comfortable doing. 

My mother’s personality is extremely unpleasant at home, to say the least. She cannot take any criticism whatsoever, she will never admit that she’s wrong. She’ll always blame the other person, and in my case, it was always me. She’s also extremely judgmental. I’ve seen it over and over again with her friends, she’s extremely two faced. She has a near flawless public facade which portrays her to be the most caring and supportive friend and mother, but would always insult everyone’s situations in front of my father and I. Because of this, I learned to never express my feelings, thoughts, and emotions to her. I had done so a few times in the past, and in the moment she would pretend to be understanding and caring, but a couple days later, or even a few hours later, she would completely turn and insult me because of my feelings. This made me become more closed off towards my mother and I began talking to her less and less as the years progressed. 

For many years, I started having suicidal thoughts because of the constant abuse I was having to endure at home. I was extremely frightened of my mother, due to her intimidating behavior towards me. 

Although I was never properly diagnosed, I did suffer from extreme depression for many years. I have only recently began to come out of it by meeting a new friend who shares very similar experiences to mine and was able to understand what I was feeling. 

Over the years, I’ve told a few people about the abusive relationship which I have with my parents. Every single time, people have asked me about why I never told an adult. The answer is simple, it would make the entire situation much more worse. 

My mother has threatened me several times that if I ever told anyone about what she did to me, that only I was going to get into trouble, and she wouldn’t. Why? Because I was the one who had compelled her to act that way, through my “misbehaving”. She said that if I ever told any of my teachers, I would get labeled as a “problem child” and that I would be separated from my classmates and would be treated differently by everyone from that moment on. 

Once I learned about abuse, and how it is dealt with by different organizations, I realized how much my mother had lied to me. She knew what she did and still does is wrong. And she knows very well about the consequences she can face if I ever open my mouth and spill all her secrets. 

The biggest reason I never told Child Protective Services is because I would never be granted a clean break from my parents. Most of the time, children who are reported to CPS are not removed from their homes. I would have to live with my parents after doing something which I felt was extremely life-changing. Not only would the relationship between me and my parents change, but other people would know about it as well. 

I know that if my mother ever got into trouble by me, she would ever treat me properly ever again. She would hold a grudge against me for the rest of her life and would never admit that she did anything wrong. She would blame me for “ruining her life”. 






I’ve always wanted to leave my parents since I was the age of 10. Finally, this year, at the end of October, I will be 18. However, I don’t know how to go about proposing the idea of moving out to my parents. 

I should mention that my parents are extremely old, my father will be 65 this year, and my mother 58. They always have wanted me to stay with them until their last breath. They have never said so explicitly, however it was always heavily implied by the both of them. 

My parents are extremely attached to me, which is extremely ironic considering the abuse they have always put me through. They always made sure that I was with them at all times possible. They make me come with them while going anywhere. Grocery stores, the bank, even a simple trip to the gas station required me to be with them. They also don’t like leaving me home alone. My dad will go as far as working from home if I have a day off from school. 

I feel guilty for wanting to leave, but I know that it is what’s best for me. 

The problem is that I don’t know how to leave. I don’t know what to tell them, I don’t know where to go. I don’t have any money because my parents never let me work. They always said that it would be too exhausting on my body and I wouldn’t be able to balance work along with school at the same time, despite many of my friends doing so. Despite all of this, my mother has constantly said that I cost too much considering that I don’t contribute to the family income. 

My parents and I are lower middle-class. We don’t have much money, despite both my parents incomes being over $150,000, when combined. My dad is going to retire soon and he still has many debts which I will most likely have to pay off in the future. 

For university, I’m not allowed to go anywhere outside of my city. I live in a large city with many reputable universities close by, and my parents want me go to one of the local universities so that I can commute daily from home. The main reason they don’t want me leaving is because they are overprotective and cannot stand the idea of me living separately. They’re disguising this fact by saying that paying for residence is a large and unnecessary expense. 

My dad has only a couple thousand saved up and I will have to take on an enormous student loan this year, all while my parents still refuse to let me work. 

I need to leave the unhealthy relationship with my parents, I should have done it several years ago. But I don’t know what to do, how to do it, or what to say.

arnzm4,I think my relationship was becoming abusive. I attempted suicide after a heated argument with my boyfriend,"As a disclaimer I had already been suffering depression after going through a previous abusive relationship and sexual assaults. But the argument my boyfriend and I had that day pushed me over the edge, I won't deny it.

It's like all of a sudden he had full on turned verbally and emotionally abusive and just kept putting me down that weekend we spent time together. He was insulting my intelligence, making crude jokes. He labeled what I said as nonsense. He was putting down my vaginal odor and being selfish about pleasure during sex. He was putting down my one bedroom apartment when he himself could not afford a one bedroom at age 30 and would soon have to resort to living with his parents until he found a new place. He flat out said that he would get me nothing for valentines day. Then he stormed out when I confronted him about how mean he was being, demanding that he talk with me. He refused to talk and said it was not his problem. He said that I had been a major buzzkill and that the entire time he had spent with me had been miserable.

I had had enough. I had enough with people being mean to me all my life, people abusing me and bullying me all my life, and I couldn't bring myself to believe that it would get any better, so I attempted. It seemed that no matter how hard I tried, nothing ever worked out.

My boyfriend recognizes that he triggered me––he apologized to me twice (over the phone and at the hospital) for being so mean and so cold. I tried reassuring him that it was not his fault (what else could I say?) but the truth is that he did deeply trigger me. He had also known about my past history of abuse beforehand. My family blames him for my attempt and they are more so disappointed by how callous he acted; they were coordinating with him the entire time after my attempt.

I never contacted him while I was in the hospital (he was actually the one checking up on me). But when I let him know that I had been released from the hospital he couldn't say much. He didn't ask me how I was doing. I haven't contacted him since, nor have I heard from him. It's been a few days.

I would appreciate any thoughts about this.",efuheart,2019-02-17 11:26:27,3,427,10.33,46.25,42.76,2,15.81,18.03,93.91,63,25.76,20.61,11.71,0.23,0,8.2,0.47,5.15,4.22,11.24,12.18,5.15,7.96,3.04,20.37,3.98,1.87,2.11,1.17,2.34,6.09,1.64,4.45,0.23,2.58,0.94,16.16,0.47,0.94,0,8.9,12.41,3.04,1.87,2.11,0.7,2.34,2.58,2.81,0,1.87,0.47,2.11,0.23,1.41,0.7,0,7.03,2.34,0.94,2.81,0.7,0.47,11.48,5.15,0.94,12.88,1.64,4.68,6.56,0.23,0.7,0.94,0.47,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.24,5.85,1.87,0,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,1.64,1.41,0

arugdo,How to forgive an abusive father,"My dad has abused my mom and siblings in the past but after we grew up, he stopped mostly. His abuse switched to emotional over the years. It's a complicated situation but my dad is my landlord now, and has been demanding money from me any chance he gets. He's extremely controlling and jealous. He found out that I was receiving money from an insurance claim for accidental damage to his building, and I finally blew up and told him it's not his money and I will not give him a dollar. The money was to fix the building, not for him to keep. He threatened to evict me, that I was no longer his daughter, and then ultimately said that he is going to kill me.

Although I know that he said this out of anger, I can't forgive him. I cannot, and do not want a relationship with him after he said this to me. I have a very heavy heart, as I grew up very traditional Korean and it is part of our culture to respect and take care of our parents. I am so worried to not have a family to turn to, someone to walk me down the aisle, a grandpa for my kids, and most of all that I will be filled with regret when he passes away. After that conversation, I spoke to him once and told him i will not communicate with him unless there is a third party there, because I do not trust him. I have not spoken to him since.

arzm9t,A Note to Anyone Wanting to Cut Toxic People from Their Lives,"I woke up today with the most beautiful family. I started thinking about how crazy that is for me to be able to say that after the way my life started out and I realized that yes, I got very lucky when I met my husband and had my daughter. Some things in life are purely luck and coincidence and originate from the goodness in others - and I am not trying to downplay just how lucky I am to have my healthy and happy family. I don't think I could have gotten here if I hadn't started with choices I made over 10 years ago. 

The danger of abusive people isn't that they will hurt you. The danger comes from carrying their voice with you, inside of yourself. If you keep toxic people in your life, you carry around their voices and your idea of yourself changes - it is influenced by their idea of who you are. 

When you meet new negative voices, even those of strangers, they match the voices of the people you love, making them easier to believe than they should be. The cruel people you encounter even briefly become easier to trust and to believe. You accept new, toxic people into your life because the abuse has become your norm - the narrative is familiar and oddly comfortable. You've set the bar low for yourself and you've created an entire framework of ""reality"" and what you deserve.

When I first left home I kept in contact with some people I really shouldn't have because I believed that being a good daughter / sister / friend / person meant I needed to forgive them and keep them in my life in the hopes they could change. I didn't want to leave them alone and, on some level, I was afraid of being alone. I gradually realized that some people are like poison, and the longer I didn't cut them out of my life they were poisoning me. 

Keeping toxic people in your life does not help them. Giving them a person to abuse or manipulate actually harms them and reinforces their behavior. Staying does not help them get better. In my experience, even waking up totally alone does not help an abusive person realize the things they've done. Beyond that, you are harming yourself and limiting your future happiness. 

After I freed myself from these toxic people, it became so much easier to spot the people who did not mean well for me. It was easier to see the red flags. To not tolerate disrespect or inconsideration. To stand up for myself and to walk away before I became involved with the wrong people. 

Distance yourself now, and the further you get down the road, the better friendships and relationships will naturally blossom in your life. Once you can recognize the weeds in your garden, you can pull them as soon as they start to grow. You can have a beautiful rose garden, but it starts with clearing out the brambles. 

It's been said by so many, but surround yourself with positive people. Accept constructive criticism, but if you find yourself saying over and over ""I can't believe they'd do that"" or ""I can't believe they'd say something so hurtful"", then you better start to believe it. Recognize the pattern and separate yourself from that person. 

You do not owe anyone your happiness - but you do owe you future self years the years freedom from abuse you need to believe good things about yourself.

I wanted to post this because I wish someone could have shown me a crystal ball when I was a teenager. I wish someone could have shown me the family I have now. I wish I could have known how happy I could be and how much better I could feel.

as03lq,I need help,"So I'm pregnant and the father is I don't even know what the right term is but he's not a good guy. He's really not he and I met through mutual friends and he hired me to do some work that was not exactly legal. He has in the course of our relationship assaulted and raped me on more than one occasion and I kept contact because I never really had a choice he's not the kind of man you say no to. He'd hire me I'd take the job other things happened but I often felt like I was on egg shells with him.

Maybe I'm being paranoid and likely I'm exaggerating but he's really dangerous and I don't know if anyone can understand this but he sees people as possessions that's the best way to describe it. I feel helpless when he's around I really do and I've known a lot of dangerous people in my life but with him it's strange it's like he's not even human sometimes.

I'm pregnant and that discovery motivated me to turn my life around but he's constantly on my mind. I have tried to cut ties before and I ended up being well lets just say last time I tried cutting ties he got one of his friends to find me and bring me to him. He and I had a long talk and he didn't hurt me not then anyway but he did say ""Do not make me have to come looking for you again."" So I feel I'm like trapped because I honestly feel like getting away is impossible.

I honestly feel like I asked for this because I knew what kind of person he was but I was so messed up myself that I would just focus on the money and his gifts. Like I always did and now I feel like this kid inside of me is paying for my mistakes and I hate myself for it. I mean do I hide my pregnancy from him? Do I turn him down for a job if he contacts even if he doesn't like that? I mean he's never going to stop looking for me if he isn't already and I know the longer I make him look the more upset with me he'll be.

as0esj,Adoption Is An Option (Verbal/Emotional Abuse),"Ahh, so recently I've made a reddit, mainly to add to the funny and/or completely outrageous and stories that will make people rage. 

This is something that has happened to me, a story between my biological father and myself. This isn't to vent, or for me to rant about the horrible parents I have. This is hopefully to provide some insight that Verbal/Emotional/Mental abuse is a real thing, and can happen at any given time. If allowed, I will post more stories on here, due to the fact I have plenty to prove my case. 

This one, is called Adoption Is An Option. Please, share this story. I want abuse victims to know they aren't alone. This is, by far, one of the more... relaxed abuse I endured from this boy. For, he is no man if he is so insecure he has to put his own wife and children below his thumb.

____

In 7th grade, I was going through an emo phase. I was twelve years old and going through a case that involved me not consenting to sex to a blood-related family member. Some might find this as their perverse ""wet dream"" but to me, and many others, this was sickening that someone went against what a child wanted, and not only took their virginity, but also any respect their family had for them and the child.

It roughly went on for a year before I decided to speak out. My parents blamed themselves for it going under their nose and tried to give me treatment. I refused, thinking I could do this on my own.

Unlike many rape victims, I didn't see myself as dirty. I saw myself as a survivor, and I personally wanted to kill my family member who did that to me. 

For my own sanity, and the person's safety, I moved three hours away from home. They were not given an address, nor were anyone else. 

We moved in with my grandparents. They have raised me in the past. From infancy until four, maybe five years old. I have fond memories of that time, however, from then on out, they grew quite wicked.

Although this happened years ago, it was a marking point in my life, and despite how hard I try to tell everyone, it was indeed traumatic for me. I have had many traumatic experiences. Most being verbal abuse, some others sadly being physical.

It happened not too long before my grandfather on my father's side passed. We were living with my mother's parents, and we couldn't sadly visit him one last time before he passed. The Child Protective Services had stated that until we [Rapist and victim] both got the help we needed, we shouldn't be in the same vicinity as the other. 

My father blamed me for the ""event"" that transpired between the family member and I. I was the stronger one. I was the more intelligent one. I was sadly, the elder one. When I tried to explain the hold he had on me, it was met with pure ignorance. I eventually, blamed my father for my downwards spiral.

How dare he blame this on me?? Does he not understand that I am now considered filthy to many family members now?? Does he not understand that I could have gotten pregnant? Or the fear of it?? Does he not know the anxiety and paranioa that not only keeps me awake at ungodly hours of the ling night, but also the same crippling, barbwire terror that causes me to lose my breath and hope I'm not having a heart attack? The same fucking terror thag causes me to look over my shoulder?! 

No. He could not, for he was not in the same position I was. So how dare he???

Our relationship grew from strained to highly abusive. It grew to the point I could not even stay in the same room as the sperm donor [father]. It grew to the point I told my therapist that if it wasn't illegal, or a sin, I'd kill the man myself; And in the most cruelest of ways imaginable. To vent my anger and bloodlust, I told the therapist exactly what I would do, in great detail. 

Not only did it disturb the therapist, it greatly disturbed and sickened me. To myself, I was just as bad as Jeffery Dahmer or Jack The Ripper!!! I was sick in the head and heart!! The therapist asked if I believed in God, and I told him, at the time, no. There was no God. (An action now I heavily regret.)

The therapist told me to listen to certain types of music, and in that little office, sprouted not only a saving grace, but also my love for everything Three Days Grace. 

Due to their music, my bloodlust was accurately executed; Their music screamed what I was as a person, and what my family [Father and Rapist] had done to me. To this day, my favorite song is Home.

I left that therapy session cleansed. No bloodlust at all, and overtime I grew into Heavy Metal, Hard Rock and the ""Emo"" music itself. It channelled the bloodlust into something manageable. I could scream out my hate and cry my heart out with the lyrics and no one would judge. It was an outlet, an amazing source of relief. 

My grand father had passed, and with that the abusive relationship grew darker. 

I don't know what had exactly transpired between us, but it left me in my grandmother's arms, holding me back, and my mother holding my father back.

Venemously, I shall never forget what that bastard told me. ""You were a mistake, ----!!!!"" He spat in my face, my mother scrunched up between us. I remember he lowered his head to peer into my eyes, his hazel orbs somehow swimming in white-hot hatred. I remember being deathly afraid for my life when he shoved my mother off of him, shook my grandmother off me and bunched his fist into my t-shirt.

He told me, he should have put me up for adoption like I was a useless, blind, guard dog. We were shocked. I remember telling him that it that wasn't the worst thing he'd tell me, and I proceeded to tell him if he was going to kill me, to do it already. That I didn't give a damn because at least I'd get to see him rot in Hell.

He stormed off, dropping me on the concrete when my grandfather came home.

To me, it was too late. I resented myself for saying that, for letting him do that to me. I promised to be stronger, but I failed myself.

He came back and my mother welcomed him in with open arms, but from then on, we'd hate each other and sneer whenever we got the chance. I'm sure if neither of us were held back by God himself, we'd have already killed each other.

That was my third traumatic experience with this man, and certaintly not my last.

Author's Note: 

I am perfectly fine. 
I have gotten therapy for my mental state and for the traumatic experiences that had occured multiple times throughout my life. I am a strong, capable adult with no bloodlust at all. We [the therapist and I] chalked it up to the simple, elegant response of: I was a child and had major anger issues and didn't understand feelings. ((Yes, BNHA fans, I was a real life Bakugou Katsuki, without the blond hair, red eyes, and with horrible traumatic experiences.)) 

Current relationship with my father? 
He's the only person I dislike in my family. The only ""Ill-will"" I have towards the man is that my mother leaves him. He's a snake, a sly fox who will soon, hopefully become exposed for his true colors.

The rapist and I have gotten a normal, healthy relationship established and have blocked those memories from our mind. 
We occasionally go to therapy if we have a problem with those horrid memories, and work them out together. I, and my family, did not press charges against him. I am a hard working adult, who in my family's eyes, have become a worthy person. ((No we aren't Asian, we are very much American. It's just that I dishonored my family by being so weak.)) 

Current relationship with my mother? 
She's still with my father. She doesn't leave him, and quite frankly I think she's forced to stay. Or maybe she needs therapy herself because if she's staying on her own will, without threats, she's as insane as I once was. I hope in due time, she'll see the snake he is and leave him to rot in Hell, but only time will tell.",crazysh-t,2019-02-18 10:39:23,1,1473,34.28,37.23,57.05,1,14.3,15.41,92.26,58.66,22.13,16.29,10.45,1.36,0.07,3.53,0.88,5.84,5.7,12.36,9.3,3.46,6.99,2.78,16.84,4.55,2.17,1.09,0.95,1.63,7.94,2.24,5.7,0.95,2.44,0.68,13.1,2.44,0,1.29,4.14,11.2,1.77,0.88,2.04,2.78,1.36,4.21,2.44,0.88,0.68,0.54,3.26,1.15,1.43,0.61,0,7.47,3.26,0.68,2.51,0.81,0.61,7.2,7.47,1.43,11.2,2.31,5.43,3.87,0.68,1.36,0.95,0.14,0.41,0.34,0.61,0.34,0.14,0.14,0.07,0,20.64,6.25,6.79,0.14,0.14,0.95,0.68,0.54,0.68,2.31,0.81,1.36
as5jey,Pretends to sleep.,"So I have been stressing a lot lately, So I decided to play games the last few days for a few hours. Today I played all afternoon while I thought wife was sleeping. At 3:30pm her alarm goes off and she wakes up, I say how are you and she replies with, o so now you want to talk to me, and bitches how I have been playing. I responded with well if you wanted to talk and spend time why didn't you ask me to put  the game down so we can talk. She exclaims well I didn't think you would be on for so long. I explained that I didn't think it would be a problem cause she was asleep the entire time. We are having relationship issues. I work 32 to 40 hrs a week supporting family on one income. So I go to work and go home. I don't have friends I hang out with so I am constantly with the wife and kids. 
 Wife has been complaining that I have been ignoring her and not talking to her. I feel like I do and maybe it because I take it for granted she will always be there. I also feel like I'm being taken for granted. I heard her when she bitched at me about doing my part on keeping house clean and doing laundry and cooking. I told her I felt it was fair for her to do that cause I was the one working. But I picked up the slack because I agreed that we would work as a team. Now it's she is tired of nagging me to change because I don't talk to her anymore I don't tell her my plans. Well it's kinda hard to do cause I want to tell her stuff but I just freeze cause fuck man I don't want drama. She wants me to talk to her but it's like I just punched a hornets nest and I can't run fast enough.",sodaboy1978,2019-02-18 18:53:01,6,340,9.38,48.82,39.55,25.77,17,10,95.29,63.53,23.53,19.71,12.06,0.88,1.47,5.29,0,3.82,3.53,12.06,12.65,7.06,9.12,2.65,22.94,2.65,1.18,1.18,1.47,1.76,5.29,2.65,2.65,0.59,1.18,0,15.59,1.18,0.29,6.18,0.29,13.24,2.65,3.53,2.94,1.18,0.88,2.65,2.06,0,0.59,1.47,1.76,0.88,0.29,0.29,0.29,7.06,3.53,1.76,0.88,0.59,0.59,5.88,16.47,0.88,10.29,2.35,3.24,5,1.76,2.65,1.18,0.59,0,0,2.35,0.88,0.59,0,0.88,0,10.88,5.88,1.18,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,3.53,0,0

My sister told my brothers it was okay to fuck her and me. My older brother did unspeakable things. He stood outside my door when I was older. But I locked it. finally old enough to know right from wrong when I was 13.  He apologized outside my door.
My sister is satan. Locked me in her closet, room, bathrooms, dressing rooms. Stole my lunch at dance. Cut my cloths hair. Threatened to kill me plenty of times.
Dad told me I would amount to nothing. That I'm stupid, crazy, dumb. when your told that enough u start to believe it. 
Mom didn't believe that my dad was verbally and physically abusive. Until my younger brother spoke up. 
And only until my mom got sick when I was 19 did I tell her about my brothers doing the horrible things. I explained it was because she never believed me. She asked if I'd bring it to court. I wasn't sure. she a b said I'd have to get a laser and have good money. Basically I would be wasting my time because I'm broke. 
I hate my family....
They call me names. When I confront them they say get over it.
I lost sleep because of them. I blamed myself. Never them. Until I met my boyfriend who hates what they did to me. Helped me feel respected for myself and feel worthy of happiness.

asv2tr,Is my family being abusive and triggering my PTSD or is my mind too wares by PTSD to see what's going on here?,"This is a ridiculously long story with no tl;dr but I really need some advice. I'm going to start around 2005. I was a high school junior with over a 4.0 gpa on track to go to my college of choice on full scholarships and then law school, and I also worked 30 to 40 hours per week as a waitress so I was paying most of my own expenses (but not rent). I eventually did all those things i planned and am now a moderately successful attorney. I was laser focused on my future when I was young so I was generally a ""set it and ""forget it"" kinda self sufficient young person at this point. I was the first person in my family to graduate from college, was valedictorian, and got my law degree with highest honors.

The kindest way I can put the next part is to say that my family had a lot of problems. My sisters and I, one of whom is close to me in age and lived with me growing up, took care of each other a lot when our parents were failing to meet their responsibilities. There was also a lot of abuse in lots of directions. Mom and Dad verbally abused the shit out of each other ruthlessly every day for years and years with my dad punching walls and cornering my mom sometimes. Our daily lives were a battlefield with them using us as pawns against each other. They allowed us children to be exposed to their behavior toward each other and it scared and confused us so much that I think it has a lifelong influence on our feeling of general security. Mom and Dad also physically and verbally abused us seriously. Dad threw my oldest sister at the wall when she was about 15 because she started dating a black guy (we lived in an area where our school was mainly black and we were white) and then he tore down all of her posters that had any black men in them, including will Smith. I consider our childhood household to be quite abusive, and I have worked quite a bit in the area of domestic violence law so I mean that objectively speaking. Based on my professional experience as a GAL I dont believe our household would have survived any amount of scrutiny by a court or an agency like DCFS. There is a lot more to this but I dont wanna lose ya here by being too long winded. 

My parents got divorced in 2000. Mom and Dad sat us down and said they were doing it for financial reasons (apparently mom had run up $40K in credit card debt and was addicted to large amounts of ephedra which was still legal then) but that we were going to stay together and they would still be a couple and nothing was going to change. Soon dad started disappearing for long periods, like going to the grocery store and then coming back with no groceries 9 hours later, or going on vacation with his new gf during Christmas to visit my grandparents, who hated my mom and thus were fine with my dad having a new gf, but not telling us he took his new gf on that trip until we found out accidentally. 

In the divorce, my dad hired an attorney, who practices now in my courtroom and does not have a good reputation in the legal community today. Back in 2000, she advised my Dad that there was no need for both of the spouses to spend money on an attorney--she could just do it for $1000 and it would be unnecessary for my mom to seek her own representation. In fact, she didnt even need to show up to court, said counsel. Sadly, I now know that this was highly unethical and that my dad getting full custody because of my mom's lack of awareness of her rights and her trust in his word even when they were divorcing was probably not the right outcome. By that I mean that if a GAL had been brought in to represent the interests of the children, Dad would not have gotten full custody and might have had to have his visitation supervised. Instead, mom felt defeated before it even began and she basically just let it all happen. 

In 2004 mom moved out after dad changed the locks while she was at work one day. She came home on a lunch break to take a shit and he wouldn't even let her in to use the toilet. It was ugly to say the least, but my sister had just gotten her license and at least she could drive us to visit our mom. Mom was never well again from that point forward. She descended into alcoholism and died at a young age from a preventable disease. Visitation was difficult but I'm still glad I spent time with her when she was still alive. 

Now, back to 2005, I was a teenager and I had planned visitation with mom on a weekend day. Mom didnt have a license anymore but she and my aunt came over to pick me up. The conflict started because my room was messy (honestly it always was, and my house is messy now, and idgaf) so my dad said I couldnt go to mom's. I tried to get into my aunt's Pontiac aztech but he grabbed me by the feet and tried to drag me out of the car onto the pavement. My mom was pulling on my top half but my dad was stronger and a struggle ensued but my dad pulled me out and dragged me on the driveway. For reference, I was 5 foot 4 and 130 lbs, and he was 5 foot 10 and about 250 lbs. There was a huge screaming match that ended in my mom and aunt leaving. I dont remember exactly why they left. 

The battle between my dad and me continued into the house, and we screamed at each other at the top of our lungs. We said the most hateful things we could conjure up. This wasnt our first go around with each other. I was standing on the top step of a set of 12 carpeted stairs and he was in the living room below as we argued. Whatever I was saying (I dont recall exactly what) made my dad so enraged that he quickly charged up the stairs toward me and clotheslined or body checked me by hitting me directly in the face with his massive shoulder. I fell to the ground and he stood over me screaming ""you wanna see who can scream louder than who?"" over and over while advancing forward as I was cowering and crawling backward on the floor of the bathroom at the top of the stairs, a distance of about 20 feet. When he had cornered me and kept coming at me and screaming, I told him to back off and that just made him more angry so I grabbed my virgin mobile flip phone and called 911. During this incident, my sister was in clear view and able to see and hear the whole thing from her bedroom near the bathroom with the door open. 

My dad was and is a volunteer firefighter so he knew a lot of the sheriff's deputies and city police officers. As soon as I called 911, he snapped immediately into a different calm personality preparing to talk to the police and save face with the emergency personnel. My sister claims that at this time he gave her his debit card and told her she may have to bail him out of jail but he now denies recollection of that. He went out into the driveway so that he could talk to the police before I did, ya know, to tell them that we just have an out of control teen here who needs to be put in her place. They took both of our statements and then asked my sister what happened. she lied and said she was in a different part of the house and had no idea what happened. 

For some reason, even though she and I grew up side by side, we have very different views of the world and the difference between right and wrong. In the end, no arrest was made but we were required to go to the police station to meet with social workers. My dad was required to do counseling and to pay for me to attend counseling and a social worker monitored our family for the next year. My dad's side of the family was not shy about shaming me for calling the cops on my dad. They did not however criticize him at all for committing domestic battery against me or for scaring me so badly that I felt I needed help from the police. 

Years passed, my mom died rather suddenly and tragically at 55 right after I passed the bar exam. I needed medication to deal with my devastation after losing my mom, and that caused my sex drive to stop completely. My former long term boyfriend sexually assaulted me multiple times after years of physical and emotional abuse. (I am aware that my abusive father may have caused me to seek out abusive characteristics in a partner). I was diagnosed with PTSD, and I already had GAD and depression. I went through a really rough time period there where I dissociated chronically. During that time period (2015), I met with my sister, with whom I shared a close relationship by then, for dinner at a local bar. Somehow the topic of the incident between my dad and me where the police were called came up between us, and she became indignant. She was angry that she was put in the middle, and she blamed me for that. 

Then, she proceeded to tell me basically that I'm not a good person and I never have been and how it is always been unpleasant for my family to have to be around me. She then told me that the incident with my dad was my fault because I just enjoy being the victim, and it was my fault I got raped and had ptsd because I just love being the victim. I literally pleaded with her to stop because it will make dad unhappy if we dont get along, but she said she was done with my shit. She and her boyfriend then stormed out, leaving me sobbing alone right as the food arrived. (They did smugly pay the bill before leaving). 

I told my dad what happened and he was puzzled that the incident even came up. He took no stance on what was right or wrong in that situation in 2005. I told him I know I was being disrespectful and being a teenager but I just want him to take responsibility too. His response was that he took responsibility by paying for all of our counseling that got required because of it. He wouldn't budge. I thought that maybe if he had grown enough to acknowledge that what he did wasnt right in hindsight, and if he were to explain that to my sister, maybe she would let up on me. No go. The true irony here is that my dad's current wife is a domestic violence prosecutor who has a 16 year old daughter with a different dad, and you better believe someone would be getting charged with a crime if they body checked that little girl, no matter what she said. Wife also frequently complains about the family dynamics that make it difficult for victims to report crimes committed against them by household or family members.

Not long after the fight with my sister happened, my dad told me my sister's bf asked for permission to ask my sister to marry him on their upcoming vacation. I didnt want to let a temporary disagreement stand in the way of my longterm relationship with my sister, so even though she never apologized for blaming me for my rape, I texted her that I love her and I hope she has a good trip. 

Our relationship has gradually improved since then. She did invite me to her wedding and I went and was nothing but nice and supportive. However, my sister and her then fiance are very simple self described country folks, and they had their wedding in their backyard so I just assumed they weren't doing a whole formal thing with bridesmaids and groomsmen. My dad had previously mentioned that my sister had her bridal shower, and I was sad she didnt invite me but I said nothing. 

Much to my surprise, I show up on the day of the wedding, already crying because I wish my mom were there, and see that 3 girls my sister has talked mad shit about in the not so distant past are dressed as her bridesmaids and conducting a bunch of little pre wedding rituals in which I was not welcome to participate. It killed me inside. My big sister and I had talked about our weddings since we were kids just assuming we would be each other's maid of honor, but instead she chose this girl who she previously said didnt really care about anything other than having a good time (getting drunk). In her maid of honor's speech, she said that she was part of our family now. Like, no the fuck you aren't bitch. This whole day absolutely made me feel like my insides were crumpling up, shrinking, and dying. I contemplated getting in my car and leaving without saying anything to anyone, but I had promised my grandma in another state I would record the ceremony for her and I didnt want to make the day about me so I just did my best to put on a happy face. After the wedding, I kept quiet about my feelings because I truly dont trust my family enough to tell them the way I feel. Part of me doesnt want my sister to know how much it hurt me because I think she would be happy she hurt me and I dont want to give her the satisfaction. 

The wedding was in October of 2018 and things have been pretty calm since then except that I've been having chronic nightmares about my dad and sister ganging up on me and telling me all the reasons I'm worthless and not a good person. These are intense ptsd nightmares that come in between flashbacks of my assaults or recreations of them. I wake up sick, panicking, and frequently vomiting. I have talked to my psychiatrist about this and adjusted meds as best as possible. I have told my dad about the dreams and he seems puzzled and cant understand how those could be based in any real memories. He has a very selective memory that conveniently excludes his own wrongdoing.

Here's the meat of the issue, finally: my dad generally treats my sister like she hangs the moon. She can do no wrong in his eyes. I think he loves her more because she's humble and only a high school grad like him and I'm all uppity and educated. He also acts like getting married is literally the best thing you could ever do. He was so much happier at her wedding than he was when I graduated law school summa cum laude, got a full scholarship to both college and law school, or landed one of the most prestigious jobs in my regional market. I feel his failure to denounce her bad behavior, his failure to tell my sister not to treat me like that because it's not right, constitutes an endorsement of her actions and words, but I dont trust either of them enough to tell them that. Every time I see or hear about him treating her like a saint, I feel like he's telling me that what she said is right. 

This last Friday night was her birthday dinner, and of course maid of honor was in attendance and well lubricated as usual. I put on my happy face and was nice to everyone, but pretty much every time I opened my mouth someone interrupted me or talked over me. It didnt help that I was the only adult at the table not drinking alcohol. My dad and my sister decided this would be an appropriate time to reminisce about what fun they had at her wedding shower (from which I was excluded) right in front of me. She said to my dad in some joke I didnt understand, ""yeah well you weren't technically allowed at my shower,"" and I thought ""yeah neither was I"" but i did not say a word, did not stop smiling, hugged everyone and left while some were still finishing dessert saying that i didnt feel so hot. 

After holding in my emotions all this time, something snapped in my head, something akin to a ptsd episode. It was like I was broken all weekend, mich worse than usual. Uncontrollable panic attacks, sobbing, and nightmares with obsessive thoughts about how my sister said my rape was my fault and my dad's complicity with all of her actions means that he thinks it was my fault too. I decided right away that I was going to need to have some space from both of them for awhile because their influence seems to be preventing me from recovering from my assaults. On Monday, I sent my dad a long text that was calmly and carefully worded but direct and assertive. I told him I need some space from them and I deserve an apology from each of them, and I requested that he not reply to the message because a back and forth exchange may traumatize me further. He did not reply.

The real problem with this whole situation is that my dad and my sister are usually my 2 closest family members. I have to admit that I've been thinking a lot about ending my life now that I dont care if it hurts them. I dont have much else left in the way of family and I don't put much stock in the idea of friends. I dont trust them. They come and go. So now it's just kind of me and my dog. 

Did I do the right thing? Am I helping my recovery or hurting myself overall by taking some space from them? I have been to a lot of therapy but none lately and I really need to hear what an outsider sees in this situation. Please give me your perspective. If you have read this whole thing thank you so much.",avocat_89,2019-02-20 14:54:04,9,3174,38.65,56.89,67.31,8.97,23.51,15.22,93.13,59.17,20.1,15.41,8.95,1.17,0.32,3.94,1.04,4.69,5.1,13.83,8.48,5.1,8.07,2.17,16.54,3.94,2.24,1.23,1.07,2.43,5.48,2.02,3.4,0.28,1.23,0.63,15.22,3.78,0.32,4.25,3.09,11.06,1.86,1.58,1.51,2.46,1.13,3.62,2.11,0.54,1.01,0.54,1.98,0.63,0.63,0.25,0.44,9.26,3.78,1.2,3.21,1.04,0.98,7.75,6.74,1.17,14.71,2.27,7.44,5.36,2.11,0.88,1.23,0.6,0.09,0.16,0.69,0.22,0.22,0.09,0.09,0,9.11,4.13,2.84,0.03,0.03,0.13,0,0.06,0.28,0.91,0.63,0.06

asxvft,"I have no one to talk to, but I need to let this out.","I’m just gonna post a big long messy rant here because I’m very isolated at this point but I need to talk about it in one form or another.

I met this guy three years ago, and within like a month we were living together. He worshipped the ground I walked on, made me feel beautiful and we had a lot of fun together. The first time he put his hands on me in a nonloving manner... I used to self harm when I was younger, then one day a fight with him made me want to do it again. He was a little rough when he grabbed me to get the weapon out of my hand, but I told myself it didn’t mean anything because he was trying to help. Then it was just a lot of grabbing/holding me down to “make me calm down” when I’d get upset. I got pregnant about a year in. A few weeks after we found out, he gets into it with his boss and quits his job, so I was the only one working. His mother came to stay with us, and he asked if it was okay if we slept on the floor so she could have the bed as we had a one bedroom apartment. She did stuff like smoke in the apartment despite being asked not to and say she wanted what we were making for dinner then throw it away and eat all our chips an hour later. Naturally, all this built up and started bothering me, and one day I just kinda lost it and went on an angry rant about his mother. His response was to point his gun at me. A few days later, I miscarried. The miscarriage caused a lot of hormonal changes so we argued more around that time because I would always make him angry. At one point, I kinda lost my shit and tried to jump off our balcony during an argument. He grabbed me off and brought me back inside, threw me to the ground, grabbed my neck and slammed my head into the floor twice. 

I’m trying to leave now but it’s hard because between loosing touch with a lot of my friends during the honeymoon phase and the depression after the miscarriage I’m not in contact with many people besides him. I’ve never actually really talked about what happened, so I think this is an important first step. If you made it this far, thanks for listening.

asyrr8,Fear,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the correct subreddit, I’m very nervous about posting this but I need to get it off my chest. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. My mother just attempted to push me down the stairs and I’m shaking like crazy. Over the past few years I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety, OCD and depression. My mother was upset with me and told me to just suck it up. My father was somewhat supportive, but lived far away and told me to ignore what my mother says and work with my therapist. A few months ago my therapist attempted to tell my mother to change how she spoke with me, which led to her getting very angry. She cursed him out then yelled about how I’m a retard and how she should’ve never gave birth. Shorty after she cancelled my therapy. Over the past few months I’ve been regressing into a deep depression and a high state of anxiety. For the past few weeks my mother has been drinking a lot. She has repeatedly insulted me saying “you’ll amount to nothing”, “I wish I had a normal son”, “stop being such a little faggot”, etc. she has thrown my computer that I saved up over the past year to buy on the ground, breaking it.

at68xa,Looking for advice on starting a movement against verbal abuse.,"Hello everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm coming to you to ask for advice. My brother &amp; I are currently facing difficult times because of issues dealing with my father's verbal abuse &amp; his constant forceful behavior that is being enabled by the Tarrant County law system. Our law system here in Tarrant County does not take verbal abuse seriously nor do they listen to children when deciding custody/visitation rights. While evidence of abuse may be presented to Tarrant County judges, it is often overlooked depending on how severe it is in the eyes of the judges. If there has been no physical harm to the victim, courts &amp; those appointed by court will not even bat an eye. On top of that, Court appointed facilitators and counselors do not take the sides of the abused/mistreated child. Instead, they justify the abuse, allow abusive &amp; reckless parents to get a hold of children (without the child's consent of course) and even go as far as to reveal confidential information they have been told that could possibly threaten the child's wellbeing. (all of which have happened to my brother &amp; I and other kids that we know, our wellbeing has been compromised.) and I want things to change. How could I promote change in my community? I know of other children that are going through similar situations &amp; I want to get together with them but I don't know how I should do it because I don't know these children personally. I would also like to find more children who are going through something similar because I've learned through my school counselor that there are lots f children going through the same thing, but how could I get them to come forward to me? How could I find these children and reach out to them &amp; what would be the first step to promoting change?",fka_twigzluver,2019-02-21 10:02:32,0,324,47.25,52.47,49.92,1,23.14,22.53,87.35,54.32,16.05,9.57,6.17,0.93,0.31,0.31,1.85,6.48,4.32,14.2,10.49,4.63,6.79,2.47,19.44,3.09,2.47,2.78,0.31,0.93,4.63,0.62,4.01,0.31,2.47,0,11.73,1.23,0,0,1.23,16.98,3.7,4.94,3.09,2.16,0.62,3.7,1.54,1.23,0.31,0,1.54,0.62,0.93,0,0,12.04,3.09,1.54,5.86,2.16,0.62,1.85,12.04,1.85,10.8,4.01,4.63,2.78,2.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.36,3.4,2.47,0,2.78,0.93,0,0,0,2.16,1.23,3.4
at9103,Does abuse affect your choices and repeat itself,"So a a kid I got sexually abused a couple of times by an older female relative not older 30 ish I was about 5 maybe 6 she was in her teens

Since that I look back and feel I was overly sexualised as a kid but I seemed to keep it to when I was alone I'd end up replaying similar events like being naked or tied up or just odd stuff like that 

But as I've grown up and been in relationships several have been with abusive people who have either been verbally, physically or once sexually abusive to me and this has seemed to be a trend they are either activity abusive or have damaging behavior towards me (cheating on me etc) 

Another issue is I seem to have sexualised this abuse so when I think about being with some one or having sex it's often in a position of one is in control and one is submissive (sometimes the roles switch but always one in control) 

So I keep thinking back to this initial abuse and think some how I attract people who are abusive and now I'm in this position where I want to be with someone but can't trust people while my sexual fantasies tend to revolve around the past abuse...

atbytp,Are they a monster?,"Sorry this might be long. So this is my first time publicly making a post. Recently my life kinda crashed into rock bottom so I decided to try and talk out more and get in touch with the human race. So growing up I always felt kind of unwanted. Nothing I did was ever good enough. And I constantly tried to please one single person, my mom. But the thing is she was more concerned about herself. Stating that because of us she could never buy anything for herself. Cussing me out and hitting me multiple times (there's more but that can be for later) . It's like all she wants to do is have everyone admire how amazing she is and she doesnt care about anyone else.  And sadly due to life throwing curveballs at me I have to live with her for the time being. But as I live with her one question came to mind. This person constantly made me feel terrible about life and I have so much resentment. But there are days when she tries to be my friend and laugh. So I want to ask. Is your abuser a monster all the time? Or does it switch on and off. This situation is really making me doubt my sanity.

atfpg0,Sisters bf raped me and she called me a lying whore,"I was raped by my sisters boyfriend. It happened at her apartment, she was passed out drunk in the living room and he came out of their room to me. He pulled down my shorts, I said no about 3 times, he started having sex with me. I didn’t call my sister, didn’t scream and I just let it happen I let him and waited for it to be done. I was scared she would’ve thought I made him want to, I didn’t want to make her insecure cuz she’s already fucking crazy I didn’t want to ruin their home. Next day was fucked up I walked around and sat at a pond to process what happened while drinking tequila at 9 am. I thought if I told shed tell my mom i did something to make him want me and my mom would’ve kicked me out n I’d be homeless. I didnt say shit for months even after she got pregnant. I told her out of anger when my mom kicked me out and they didn’t believe me, cut me off and let me be homeless. This has happened with another guy, I continued seeing the guy cuz I needed to stay there and just thought “he already used me anyway” and they knew about it and it’s one of the reasons they think I wanted this. After a while we were okay but today they brought it up again and called me a lying whore. She came back to my moms and I can’t live there so now I’m back to being homeless sleeping in my bfs house. I have done so many things to help him, I’ve spent so much money just to be there when he’s suicidal, ubering to him in the middle of the night, travelled 3 hours few times when he was in a different city cuz he was depressed. Took his abuse when he was using Xanax and didn’t give a shit about how it hurt me. Spent hours walking outside with him, paying for hotels and air bnb so he doesn’t sleep in the street. Tonight I just needed someone there for me that’s all and he just wanted me to stfu so he can pass out and gives no fucks. I feel alone, have nobody to talk to and I’ve been crying for hours and hours and I just can’t take it anymore. Someone I’ve shown so much love and care to this whole fucking time treated me like such an annoying burden for being sad about how traumatizing this rape situation is for me and he treated me like I’m such an insignificant person and I just feel like I want to die. I have nowhere to go, I don’t want to stay with him after I saw how the same type of love and care isnt reciprocated, I’m going to a shelter, I have to quit school and work or just fucking quit everything stop trying and die ......

atgsoz,"Help me, please! He's starting to freak me out.","I think he's also a redditor, not sure if he goes to this subreddit but I want to keep myself safe in case so I'll keep the ages secret and a few other things. If you're willing to talk to me in private, I'll be more open with the information about the story here. He's starting to freak me out. Should I be worried?  


My phone is old, I am unable to block him and even spam messages just get a label.   


Guy met me at work, we hit it off nicely. Seemed fine, he seemed interested after a while and he also knows I'm transgender. Didn't seem to have a problem, then he did... then he didn't. He continued to flip-flop and it made me feel awful about myself. I was wanting to break it off, he was reluctant to but I decide to end it and it seemed civil. Didn't do anything physical at this time.  
Cue a week later, he messages me stating he missed me. I was cautious, he seemed certain of himself this time though.  
Eventually we did get intimate, then the day after which was New Years Day he broke it off with me via text. I told him to never contact me again.  


About 20 days later, he contacts me again and asks a personal question. I tell him to leave me alone. Silence for a week or so. 

Again, when he contacts me- he states he misses me, I am unsympathetic. He states he ran away because his feelings grew intense and he is ""trying to adjust to the idea that he is bisexual"". I told him that I don't have any feelings for him anymore, he grows silent. I tell him to not speak to me again. I did my best to not let my anger consume me, as we do have mutual friends and I don't wish to sow any discord.  


Every now and then he tried, same result.   


Early-ish of this month: He contacts me and is apologetic again. I left texts unanswered even though my phone notification would go off. He stated again that misses me, that him running away was a mistake, that he'd be willing to be friends platonically and I state that the only way we'd be able to speak is on those terms only. He agrees, and seems to act normally at first. **It didn't last long.**  


Soon he sends sexual text messages and is begging for me to get in a relationship with him, every time I decline and state why. I didn't answer him for a while, but then when he continued yesterday I had enough and snapped.  


I ask him to delete me again, he gets mad because he says I am ""being rude"" while making attempts at making me feel bad. I respond that every time I asked him to cease contact, he wouldn't. Every time, he was the one came back into contact and the only reason why I was trying to keep things peaceful is for the mutual friends.   


So in my mind, I thought *fuck the mutuals.*

  
He says a veiled threat and I, now finally *furious*, tell him that doesn't mean shit to me since he hasn't the right to be angry now. He starts insulting me and tries to make excuses about ""how he was trying to make amends"" and I cite the clear violation of the boundaries I put and how I repeatedly declined him.  
Then finally, I end it and so far there isn't a response. I'm expecting him to show up in some way. I'm not sure if he would go as far as to physically hurt me, but from what I was recently told by others he has physically abused an ex and also threatened people in the past with physical violence.  


So what do I do?   
I've been in an abusive relationship before but that was also complex and much darker than this one. ( He also knew of this ), so I won't get into details about that. But I don't know what to do.

atilm7,Special needs and abuse,"I was raised in the 80s and 90s, and I have autism, among other learning disabilities. This is my throwaway account, because I need some information about what happened without identifying myself. My mother was/is an an emotional abuser with narcissistic tendencies. She was/is a gaslighter, and facilitated my being sexually abused for years by her own father. But I'm pretty sure a major part of what I'm recovering from in my emotional life is related to my mother's insistence that there is nothing wrong with me, when I was anything but neurotypical. I wasn't diagnosed until my late 20s. During my entire childhood, my mother insisted I could do better if I ""tried harder"".  My sensory issues were me being ""spoiled"", or a ""princess"", and my social issues were never taken seriously.

I would consistently misunderstand rules and expectations. For example, I have, more times than I could count, looked up and noticed all of the other children and the teacher have left the classroom, and that I was alone in the dark. I routinely did homework but failed to understand I was required to bring it to school or turn it in. My mother called me ""stubborn"" and ""obstinate"" and ""ornery"", and said it wasn't possible that all the children could leave a classroom without my noticing; essentially calling me a liar every time I tried to provide an explanation for my puzzling behavior.

I feel like she should have known. I never had a teacher who didn't express real concern about me to my parents. Did any of them suggest a learning disability? Autism? I don't know. But wouldn't you do something if everyone said there was something wrong with your child, and your child seemed unhappy and unsuccessful a lot of the time? I was lonely, and bullied by both children and teachers. I made very few friends and kept even fewer. I never got invited to parties, and was strikingly immature. As a child, I was certain all of these things were my fault. As an adult, I can't imagine raising a child like this and being unaware of the child's suffering, or thinking any child would willingly bring these things on himself.

I knew it was dangerous to ask, but every once in a while, I begged her to have me evaluated. She said I just thought I was ""too fancy"" for regular school and wanted her to waste a bunch of money on me just because I was too lazy to write things down. I developed depression and social anxiety, and became suicidal. I dropped out of high school. I feel in many ways that I have never fully recovered from these issues. I sometimes believe she purposefully did not have me evaluated, perhaps because she suspected her father was victimizing me (he had done the same to her), but I also wonder if I am being too hard on her for the place and time. 

I feel like I need to know, for my current well-being, what happened to me. Recovering from being undiagnosed as a young person during a time when diagnosis could not reasonably have been expected to have been made (like being dyslexic in the '30s), is one thing. But coming back from being maliciously ignored by someone who, if they had loved you for who you were (or at all, really), could have changed your life entirely for the better, is something else entirely. When I bring this up now, she brushes me off and says she ""can't change the past"". She seems, genuinely, to believe she had no reason to think I had significant problems, or that they could have been rectified (money and insurance were not an issue for us then, for the record). She seems to believe she owes me no apology and that it was she who was the victim here, of having been saddled with such an unruly child.

TLDR: I'm non-neurotypical and went undiagnosed as a child, but am starting to believe there was more to this than just an ignorance of neurodiversity; anyone have any similar experiences?",Brilliant_Literature,2019-02-22 07:04:36,1,694,25.96,28.7,64.31,3.6,18.76,19.74,92.07,61.53,19.88,14.41,10.09,0.14,0.86,2.88,0.43,5.48,5.33,12.25,12.1,4.47,8.36,2.74,20.46,3.89,2.59,1.44,0.29,3.17,4.9,1.3,3.6,0.14,0.72,1.01,10.95,1.01,0.14,3.31,0.58,18.73,5.62,1.44,3.03,4.18,2.45,4.76,1.87,0.29,0.58,0.86,1.01,0,0.58,0.14,0.14,7.06,1.01,1.59,3.46,0.58,1.01,9.22,8.36,0.58,8.65,1.44,3.31,4.03,2.16,0.29,0.14,0.72,0,0.14,0.29,0,0.14,0,0.14,0,17,4.61,5.48,0.14,0.29,0.58,0,0.29,2.31,1.87,1.15,0.29
atlfx0,My Dad's wife,"I really don't know where to post this, so here it is.  Growing up, I had a near-perfect family. My mom and dad divorced when I was 6, but it must have been the most civilized divorce ever.  I do not recall any fighting, hostility or even loud arguments. All 4 of my grandparents were alive until I was 25. I am an only child and so is my dad. I really did not realize how good things were. Well, it has all gone wrong now. I am in my 40s and all my grandparents have passed away an my mom died from smoking (she had COPD) around 10 years ago.

My dad remarried when I was a kid, maybe 10 or 11. I was not really upset because nothing changed for me. His wife was always cordial and polite to me, she never tried to replace or badmouth my mom...nothing like that.  In the last couple of years, my dad has developed dementia, though, and things have been turned upside down.  His wife is openly hostile to me. She has slammed the door in my face, hung up on me when I try to call him, tells outrageous lies about me (to Dad and anyone else who will listen) and will not even let me and my dad have a private conversation without her.  My dad tells her to go away and to leave us alone in his coherent moments, but a lot of the time, he is just oblivious.  Remember, I am alone in this. Dad and I are both only children, so there is no one to turn to.

As you might imagine, there is money involved here. But she is over 80 years old, has her own pension and social security and Dad has set aside a very generous amount for her and given her the house they currently live in along with a new vehicle.  It's always been  known that everything else (my grandparents' home, land family money from previous investments) will be mine.  As his mind continues to deteriorate, she is trying to push me out of his life completely.  For the last 2 years, I took FMLA from my job to help care for my dad and have tried to help with anything he needed.  He has had trouble keeping up with his meds and when to take what, so she and I had been arranging them for him in those daily pill containers.  Now she has decided to ""care"" for him by herself (meaning I have no way of knowing what she is doing.)

I am afraid my dad is in danger. She has even mentioned to some of her family that she is ""tired of taking care of him.""  I've no clue what meds he is on right now, but he is unnaturally docile and frequently forgets things. She no longer lets me help care for him at all and she frequently yells at him and becomes verbally abusive to him when he forgets things.  I am 100% willing to take care of him myself and I fear she is going to hurt him, or worse. Since Dad and I are both only children, I have no siblings or aunts or uncles to help me or back me up.

What can I do?  I have seen what dementia eventually does (my paternal grandfather had it too) and I just want as much quality time with my dad as possible at this point. This is breaking my heart. It is impossible to reason with her at all and my dad's dependent on her for his medical care. He takes serious medications. Insulin, heart and blood pressure meds and she controls it all. I fear for his life at this point.  I need help, I need advice...I need a miracle and I just don't know where to turn for help. Any advice would be so much appreciated.",Merrinli,2019-02-22 11:04:30,4,660,15.51,61.34,42.39,10.47,16.1,12.88,93.94,62.58,21.82,17.42,9.55,0.3,0.15,7.12,0.3,4.39,2.27,13.33,11.36,6.97,8.33,2.27,18.64,3.33,1.21,2.12,1.52,2.58,5.3,1.97,3.18,0.76,1.21,0.45,17.58,5.15,0,4.55,6.82,11.67,2.27,0.91,1.21,2.88,2.42,3.33,0.76,0.15,0.45,0.15,2.12,0.61,1.36,0,0.3,6.97,2.58,0.61,2.73,1.21,0.76,5,13.03,0.91,13.03,1.82,6.06,5.15,0.61,0.45,0.91,0.61,0,0.3,0.15,0,0,0,0.15,0,14.55,6.82,4.09,0,0,0.15,0,0.15,0.61,1.06,1.52,0.15
atqv04,Is this abuse (details in post)?,"I calmly confronted my boyfriend about flirting with a girl (which he has since admitted to). The night I brought it up though, he got super angry. He sort of puffed up and his jaw got rigid. Then he sat down about arms length from me and hunched over. He was trembling and staring off at the side of the room, unresponsive. Then he picked up a knife from beside him opened it, and sat there gripping it, white knuckled and trembling. 

I didn't feel scared. It didn't even feel real.

He has a history of anger and some violence, mostly physical fights with other men in his family. 

My gut tells me he was thinking about stabbing me or himself, but he never actually threatened anything so a part of me feels like there's no use overreacting. 

I told him the other day (for separate reasons) that I'm leaving him. He got all sweet with me and asked us to stay together. I felt guilty (not because he made me feel guilty, for separate reasons) and I ended up caving.

He ruined my relationship with my best friend (he didnt purposefully sabotage it, he just did something really stupid and it caused too much stress for her) and now he's the only person I can rely on for emotional support. I'm not in any kind of place to walk away. I just keep telling myself that this is temporary and that I'll find my way out once I've found a good support system, but that seems to be taking forever. 

I tell myself he never really threatened me anyway. I feel so disconnected from any sort of feer you'd expect I'd be feeling. It's like knife guy and boyfriend are two separate people in my head.

My name is Gabriella Meadows and I am conducting a research study to fulfill the requirements of my Master's degree. The study is entitled, The Effects of Parental Abuse and Neglect on an Adolescent's Self-Esteem Within Interpersonal Relationships. Please note, the purpose of this study is not to discuss the abuse and/or neglect that you experienced as a child, but how those experiences shaped your self-esteem within interpersonal relationships during your adolescent years. Absolutely none of the questions asked will discuss any of the events you experienced.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to recruit and interview 8 individuals, raging in ages 25 to 40 years, who experienced abuse and neglect by  a parent before the age of 14. Each individual will receive a $5 Amazon gift card (sent electronically via email).  The interviews will take place over phone at a scheduled date and time. Each participant will be asked the same 7 questions, with each interview lasting up to (1) hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are interested, please take a moment to view the attached Google Form. This form will provide you with the Statement of Informed Consent and the list of interview questions. There is also a space to sign up for an interview date and time, along with a provided space for your contact information, which is kept completely confidential.

ats6vj,Spousal Abuse,"My wife called the police on me (agqin) because I accidentally injured her while attempting to prevent her from attacking me... 

So my beautiful wife 🤔 has self described ""complex PTSD"". I've always done my best to be her rock, mostly because that's the person I am and also because of the abuse that she suffered. I guess I am codependent in that way, where I want to always be the strong supportive partner.  

So from time to time something will come up, something tiny or big, that will ""trigger"" my wife into a state of PTSD. When she's in that state she is fearful, agitated, aggressive, angry, confused, enraged and in all possible ways, downright scary to be around. 

Admittedly she has assaulted me many times, and I haven't retaliated, blocked her or attempted to subdue her in anyway. When she is ""triggered"" she will break anything and everything, especially things that are important to me. I love electronics, I mean really love tech, so naturally they are the first items in our house to be destroyed. The TV for some reason is almost always the first victim of her violence. Of course, if you're gonna break something try and find the most expensive items you can! If my laptop, tablet or phone are around she will attempt to break them by throwing them and stomping on them then throwing them again. I've replace countless TVs due to her violence. 

On one occasion she was so enraged, ""triggered"" that, after a scoufle in our upstairs livingroom she followed me to my downstairs bedroom where I had retreated in defeat. I heard her coming to the room so I grabbed a nearby hammer and held it up, hoping to frighten her away... This time she would not be moved away from me, as she was carrying a footlong knife from our kitchen. So, instead of hurling the hammer at her or doing anything that would hurt her, as I still love her and wouldn't want to hurt anyone with a hammer or anything for thatmatter, I tried to close the door. Well when I did that she immediately started slicing through the crack in the door, as I was closing it, and cut my fingers. She retreated upstairs and pretended like I was attacking her or after her. Once I saw the damage I decided that I needed medical attention. I did end up getting 5 stiches in my finger and had a few chunks taken out of my wedding ring, oh the symbolism of it all. 

I, being the codependent cowardly idiot that I am, forgave her, even as she blamed me for the incident. Now, fast forward, 2 calls to the police later where she is berating me about new contacts in my contact list. Desiree and Fabiola. She was furious, livid, hurling insults at me. It didn't take long before she began her physical attack. While I was seated on the couch she grabbed my left forearm and dug her nails deep into my skin, causing me to bleed, then with her left hand she dug her nails into my neck and then began punching me. I, in a fumbled attempt to get away from her and stop her assault struck her with my right hand. The strike was powerful enough to cause a near instant hematoma. She again tried to attack me as I got up off of the couch, but I was able to subdue her with a neck hold using pressure points. Felling horrible that I had injured her, I went and got some ice, Aleve and water for her ok blending headache. 

Fast forward roughly 36 hours later and I am being woken up to her yelling at me for befriending a female coworker on Instagram. Luckily this time my bags we packed with all the valuables, as they were at risk for being destroyed. Now the police have a warrant for my arrest and have been to my job. I had to ca out of work once because of this situation and now have to explain to everyone why the cops were looking for me. The worst part is that part of me wants to go back. I need help. I don't deserve to be arrested. I just wanteda happy calm life.",MusaOne,2019-02-22 22:05:44,1,721,44.12,52.77,46.85,2.1,18.02,18.72,88.63,58.81,21.5,17.34,9.29,0.55,0.28,6.38,0.83,4.16,4.99,14.84,8.46,4.72,7.49,0.69,14.42,4.44,2.08,0.97,1.11,1.39,7.49,2.36,5.13,0.97,2.77,0.42,11.93,0.69,0.42,6.93,0,9.71,1.25,1.66,1.66,3.61,1.25,1.94,2.22,0.42,0.55,1.25,2.77,1.53,0.97,0,0.28,8.18,2.08,1.39,3.74,1.11,0.55,5.55,6.66,1.53,16.09,1.94,8.04,6.66,1.11,0.55,1.11,0.14,0,0,0.83,0.14,0.14,0.14,0.28,0.14,14.29,5.83,5.69,0,0,0,0.14,0,1.11,1.25,0.28,0

I was in my room working. I wasn't even aware she was in the house. At one point I hear her voice nearby. While I'm still inside my room and me and her haven't interacted at all, I hear her say something nasty related to me outside the door.

Some context. This girl has often been cruel to me in the past. Really childish behavior like singing loud songs mocking me. I don't know, because our family is very high conflict it's hard to interpret everyone's actions. They are generally people who live by really shitty standards. They feel justified in being nasty. They often are critical of others. Their conversations tend to really show a high degree of NPD like traits. They talk about how they're superior to others in looks, style, what they do, etc. They're shallow. You don't get normal, ever. It tends to be a cluster B shit show, 90 percent of the time. I'm not sure if it's related to me, a dislike of me or a clash in our attitudes.

I start walking outside and not really addressing her but just ranting like an idiot without looking at her, in english, she doesn't speak it, I know this is really dumb, but I just needed an outlet for my anger. I start ranting about what a bitch she is, how she has bpd, she needs help (this is something my family in general likes to say about me, a running gag that has even culminated in stints in abusive rehab programs). When they call me crazy I don't take it lightly. I interpret it as a threat and I think it's reasonable to take it that way.

I then have my aunt come over and say she's calling a doctor. I see this woman constantly verbally abuse her 4 year old grandchild. I enable it. I don't know how to help him. It's nonsense. I would be embarrassed to do that. This woman is actually not as emotionally up and down as others in my family but she's cold to the bone, just scary.

I'm now questioning if she was really provoking me. It was either imagined or wildly unfair. The unreasonableness of it makes me doubt it was about me. But then, in the past, when I've given them the benefit of the doubt, the behavior just got worse and worse.

It's like this girl can't stand being around me. I have a second relative be constantly nasty to me the same way too. I started off cold towards them. The idea of getting to know any of my family is really unappealing to me. In response to my aloofness, they started to become really cruel. I've heard the term go for the jugular used often when it comes to BPD.

I see these two girls as likely to become abusive and nasty so I have no desire to make them angry, upset, get back at them. Just for strategy's sake. I have no regard for them but why the fuck would I mess around with this type of person. I have no desire to get involved in any conflict whatsoever. 

But it's like even shying away sets them off. And I can't stand the BPDness of it. I feel crazy. I see that they have no right to be nasty to someone for any reason, especially out of the blue. But the ""crazy"" of it just makes me so angry. I'm so disgusted by it. My mom was like that. I just can't stand it.

au49wl,Ignorant parents and a monstrous brother,"My oldest brother Daniel is 7 years older than me. He took advantage of this by making me his personal servant. I mean I'd carry out at least 15 tasks for him daily. He owned me. I tried saying no and he stomped me and even sprained my muscle in my lower leg. He told me once that I wasn't worth the clothes I was wearing. Daniel HIT me. A lot. He Left both of my arms extremely purple from shoulder all the way past my elbow. Had to wear long sleeves for a whole week. Threw me down the stairs. About 2 months ago he peed on the floor in my room and used my clothes to clean it up, and put the pee soaked clothes on my bed. Yesterday he told me if he sees me alone he'll kill me. Today he wiped his butt after pooping on my bed comforter and put a pillow on top of the smear so I wouldn't find it as quick. I went to sleep the whole night last night wondering where the foul smell was coming from then found the smear after several hours of searching for left out food that I may have forgotten. He walks in to my room as he pleases when I tell him not to and takes what he wants. I've caught him stealing money from my room and when I confronted him he got aggressive with me! He took the money and I told my mom. She said basically it wasn't a large enough amount for me to be this upset. I don't deserve anything in his opinion. Today I told my parents what he did, frustrated as you can probably imagine, and even showed them the shit smear on my bed comforter. My dad turned it around on me and even told me I have no right to feel angry. Years of having such a fearful relationship has led me to develop severe anxiety, social anxiety, depression, repressed emotion, stiff neck muscles, and digestion problems. I dropped out of school because I even got suicidal for the first time in my life. I get blamed for all of this. I know logically this isn't right, but I've even started blaming myself. I want to move out but don't make enough to support myself. Now I'm 20 and daniel is 27, still living at home Jobless and spends the day getting ego boosts by frightening me, and just overall being a complete less than human monster. On top of this, I'm dealing with grief from the loss of my immediate elder brother. He was very protective of me and I felt comfortable around him. we did everything together. He died in 2016 of osteosarcoma cancer. Daniel knows him just as well, didn't shed a single tear. Since then I've gone all downhill mentally. I deleted all the phone numbers out or my phone and don't have a single person I talk to. There are several details I've left out just so this doesn't run too long but I think you can get the idea of what kind of toxic people I've been conditioned by. I keep a knife on me at all times and I'm always in a state of stress and panic. I was recently robbed at knife point by people I don't know and this multiplied the anxiety and paranoia I already feel. This has bleed over into my daily life and I can't function properly. I've turned to alcohol abuse and often times drink as soon as I wake.

TLDR: Brother hits me when I don't follow his orders, believes and has told me I am worth less than the clothes I'm wearing. He has even gone to the extent of threatening of wiping his bare ass after defecating, with my bed comforter/sheets. He's peed on my room floor and wiped it with my clothes. He's stolen money from me and I got hit for confronting him about it. He walks all over me and goes completely without any consequence. I'm always scared for my life in my home and even have to carry a knife to feel safe.
 This has led me to several mental/emotional illness and alcohol dependency. I am blamed for the way I feel.",sYesh,2019-02-23 20:21:46,3,723,42.73,22.76,90.61,1,14.76,14.25,91.98,55.19,21.3,18.26,13,0.14,0.28,4.7,0.14,3.04,4.43,14.25,7.33,4.7,6.64,2.21,17.43,5.39,2.9,0.97,1.38,2.77,5.67,0.83,4.56,1.66,1.66,0.69,9.82,1.11,0,0.28,5.39,8.99,2.35,1.11,0.69,1.66,1.66,2.07,1.94,0.55,0.55,0.69,4.98,3.18,1.94,0,0.69,5.67,1.38,0.83,1.8,1.52,0.83,6.64,10.1,0.97,16.87,2.77,8.16,5.95,0.55,0.41,1.52,0.83,0,0.55,0.69,0.41,0.14,0,0.14,0,12.86,6.5,2.07,0.14,0,0,0.14,0,0,3.73,0,0.28
au4qxt,His name is James(Taumasi) Seung Goo,"I would usually censor out of respect and privacy, but since he lacked any in and out of our relationship(sharing my nudes as revenge porn, slandering me and having his current gf bother me), I will not bother to censor out his name or information. It's a long story even though it was only the span of about 4 months but I'm writing this post in hopes that others read it and can learn from it, to vent my story, and to warn others if you come upon him. This all happened in mid 2017, but honestly has been something in the back of my head because it haunts me that I allowed any person to do this to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**It all began in an app.** I used Tinder hoping to find a healthy, loving relationship, I had just turned 18 a month before I downloaded the app. I was aware most people had used it for hookups but I was awkward and socializing in real life, and hoped that I could actually find a relationship on an online dating app because I was better at texting. When I first saw him I thought he was a fake account because he was too good looking, and also had some serious muscles, I added his SC that was in his bio and we began to message. I was shocked to find out he was the real deal and not some catfish account. Little did I know he really was catfish, not in his looks but in his personality. 

**It was heavenly**. After the first two weeks I thought he was the one despite of the small amount of time spent. We'd talk everyday. We both couldn't drive, he didn't work but I worked so I would pay for uber/lyft to see him as he lived about 30 min away and uber/lyft would be from 35-50$, sometimes I would bus 3-4 hours because it would only cost 7$ and I was low on money. I wasn't that well off as I saved up to about 3k from when I was a kid, never spending money and working as a tutor in highschool, then my senior year becoming a part time worker. Certain red flags would pop up such as him saying he wants to take steroids \[*ILLEGAL\]*, and him talking and comparing me to his ex. I didn't have much relationship experience before this so I ignored these signs. He began to take steroids, specifically Trenbolone. About 3 weeks to a month in our relationship, he got kicked out of his house because he had an argument with his parents then he  threatened to beat up his stepdad, he broke their TV, door, mirror, and a couple other things out of anger. My parents didn't like him and didn't want him(he never greeted them, wasn't polite, and would used our kitchen and not clean up) to stay at our house. I would sneak him in. He gave up on his life, he told me there's no point in living he got kicked out and has no where to go. I cried, and tried everything to help him, I eventually ended up paying for him to live at a motel for a week, then his mom came back to help. This was a horrible week, as his mood was up and down he broke up with me about two times and got back with me. My best friend (the only one I would tell the complete story to) was beginning to dislike him. I almost broke up with him, but he threatened me telling me how he knows where me and my family live. His mother found him a place to live (a studio apartment) and he asked me to move in, I was 18, fresh out of high school and had just begun my first semester in college, of course I said no and that I wasn't ready for that kind of commitment as we both couldn't drive and he lived about 30-40 minutes away, so I knew I wouldn't be able to do school and live with him. He, again, uses suicide to get me to this time get my best friend to drive me to the motel where he gets mad telling me how he wants to kill himself etc which makes me feel guilty, even though I had no fault in this.

![img](8kg43qea3gi21 ""Him texting me that he's going to start taking steroids and to \""trust him\"""")

**I moved in with my abuser**. At that time I wasn't aware he was, I was naive, and he made sure to take advantage of that. Everything became a downhill spiral from there on. I got a job at target as a cashier after 2 weeks of my moving in. James did not get a job because he said that he is on steroids and plans to focus on working out at the gym to become a famous body builder which later on will make him rich. I have no idea why I was even okay and agreed on paying for us. His mother tried to help, she was working at a Korean restaurant part time but most of the time she couldn't pay half the rent  of me and Jame's studio apartment which would end up me paying $900 out of the $1,400. We would fight a lot over small things. He got mad easily because he was on steroids and already previously had anger issues. Like for instance he tried to sell a game at game stop and his mom forgot to bring a part of the game so he couldn't sell, he was cussing out shouting at his mom in the parking lot, a bystander told him that's not how he should be speaking to women and he cussed the bystander out calling her a fat bitch, we had to drive away because they called the police. He also had trust issues constantly check up my phone, I was okay with him going through my social medias and knowing my passwords because I know I have nothing to hide, he would check my phone every now and then and even messaged some of my male friends to stop messaging me. He got mad at me once because I had a picture of the sky as my story, and a guy friends messaged me asking if he could have the pic, he says I shouldn't reply to any males, or even talk to any males because i shouldn't be entertaining males. To give me an example he became friends with a 16 year old girl named Kaylee \[*ILLEGAL\]* because James was 18 at the time) at the gym he went to and they would work out together, he would show me their texts, which was very flirty, and she would even snap chat him nudes. I got mad and said I was going to break up with him if he didn't ghost her, eventually he did. During this time I moved out once because of all the fighting, he was sad to find out that I gave up on us living together and guilt tripped me again to move back in. It got worse.

&gt;(NSFW) We were having sex and he got limp(steroids) and blamed me for being too loose or dry. He pulled out his porn and me, wanting to be sexy or some shit, I ask if I can watch with him and like, do it together. He immediately gets angry which confused me as I thought me offering that would be a turn on. He began to break things around the apartment which I start to cry, he proceeds shout at me ""WHAT THE FUCK IS IN PORN? YOU FUCKING TELL ME"" and smack my head, I said stop hitting me, he replied that he wasn't doing it hard because if he was I would be dead. Afraid, I scurry into our restroom, which he told me to get out of. When I replied with no, he stormed in and dragged me out the restroom, tossed me onto the bed and began choking me, I tried to push him off but he was really strong. I couldn't even scream, he was raging to me about how there are dicks in porn and I shouldn't be looking at other dicks, especially porn dicks because they're big (he's insecure about his 3 inch which I never said anything or implied anything to make him feel bad. I only do that now because I realize he's a piece of shit). It all stopped when there was a knock on our door telling us to open. It was the police. And like most victims of abuse, I lied to protect him. I moved out

![img](q5f14oo83gi21 ""900$ I paid for rent"")

**He promises me he'll be better.** He said it wasn't him, that monster that hit and choked me. He said if I come back to him, he'll give me a better life. One too many tries, I let him try again, I moved back in and the same, old routine of me taking 1.50$ bus to work, I worked full time as a cashier at the target where his gym was. He would make his mom take him or make his mom pay for lyft/uber, while I resorted to taking the bus two thirds of the way then walking because it was cheaper. I constantly tried to save up because I would be spending a lot on rent, food, and other necessities, while he kept asking me to buy him gym wear or other things. I felt like everything was really one-sided.

&gt;I stopped (NSFW) ""servicing""(suck his schlong) him in bed. He got mad I didn't want to we had a fight but it was soon over because I had to go to work. 

I came back and we just didn't talk to one another a much. Then I began to noticed recently how he has been getting texts from girls which he would brush off as nothing. One night he leaves his phone unlocked and fell asleep, I never looked through his phone even though he would always check mines but I was highly suspicious, I found out he had been texting, sexting, other girls and maybe even meeting up, I locked the phone after just viewing a few messages because I was in shock. I went outside in the parking lot to cry, feeling betrayed that after all I've done and suffered through he couldn't stay loyal. I waited till he woke up and I confronted him, asking him if he's been sexting/texting other girls. He said no, I bursted out calling him a liar revealing that he left his phone unlocked and I had seen everything. He tells me that I shouldn't have went through his phone. We had a long conversation about it and he let me move out-- this time not begging or threatening with suicide for me to come back. I would stay weeks at my best friends house as I had not spent time with family nor friends during my relationship with him because a lot of them didn't like him, which he would make me cut off ties because he said they were toxic and didn't understand our relationship because they aren't in our relationship. My best friend was really supportive and wanted me to break up with James, which I found really hard because he would call me and cry because he said it feels like I'm distant (I fell out of love after he physically abused\[*ILLEGAL*\] me, and cheated on me). After Christmas he broke up with me because I spent Christmas with my best friend, and I told him next Christmas I'm spending it with my best friend too. He tried to get back with me but I would reject, and we even became FWB but I just lost interest. I eventually got with my current bf (CB) which was friends with my best friend even though it was only about 5 days after me and James broke up. I told James about CB and he got salty about it. He would sometimes cry to me, and to make him feel better I would tell him he was a good bf etc( also I was scared he might threaten me as he did before saying how he knows where me and my family live). Our texts ended with him telling me I owe him 30$ for a charger which I ghosted because I realized I don't owe him shit.

![video](agxl6lt16gi21 ""How angry he gets and how he talks to me, doesn't matter if you're calm and trying your best to cool the situation down, he always blows up and uses demeaning words and anger"")

**Afterword**..Late 2018, James dated a girl( let's call her Em) after me. Em and him broke up, and she connected with me and told me how she hated me because James would tell her how bad of a gf I was, that me and him were together for a year( which is a lie we were only together for 4 months), he bought me an engagement ring (another lie he never got me shit when he did like twice in our relationship he used his mom's money), and that I cheated on him(He cheated on my and try to turn me into the bad guy loool). He would even send her my nudes to make fun of me(revenge porn, \[*ILLEGAL*\] again). Only after a few months of being with him Em realized James was all bullshit and James moved on and dated like 6 girls after Em. Fast forward to early 2019 my good friend Chuck (one of the guy friends that James blocked on my phone) has a friend named Maria, some 17 year old who is now dating James. Chuck says he forgot the whole thing that happened between me and James and I tell him I will warn Maria. I tried to text her but she called me telling me we should all meet up (her, Chuck, and me). I usually would NOT agree to this but Chuck was a good friend of mine. I said sure and she set up the destination and time. I get there, and I text her that I'm there, she said she's on the way. 40 minutes passes and she's still not here. I text Chuck asking where he or Maria is, Chuck is confused because he didn't even know we were all meeting up apparently Maria made these plans and didn't even tell him even tho she said Chuck was coming. I text her asking her ETA which she doesn't reply, I spend 20 minutes more waiting then I leave and gave her the benefit of the doubt that maybe something happened. I try to text her everything but she calls me and we FT for about and hour, I told her my story, and she was telling me all these red flags about how he makes her pay for everything etc. I felt good because I was able to warn someone and that person wouldn't have to fall into the same abuse that I had to face. Little did I know.. Just yesterday my friend Chuck messages me telling me how Maria is moving in with James and how Maria is telling everyone I cheated and I said all these ""lies"" because I miss James and I want him back. I'm not even mad about Maria, even if she stood me up for an hour and is spreading lies about me because I know her staying and being with James is her own punishment. I was hoping she wouldn't have to go through that but sometimes we have to go through it to learn it. I hadn't been able to say the whole story out like this and I'm glad to get this off my chest as I kept quiet my entire relationship with him because I wanted to protect him. Thank you for those who read the whole thing as it was quite long, and to anyone who felt how I felt, scared, and thinking he can destroy you, you can do it, call the police, call your friends or family for help, don't let yourself be isolated and let this person control you and your life. Please, do something, don't let it get worse like I did.

au5wai,I am an abusive partner and I don't know how to stop. I want to be a better human and partner. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. Please help me.,"My wife, a wonderful human who I adore is trapped in a relationship with me. I have threatened suicide in the past and she cares so much that she has stayed with me despite these threats and because of these threats. I do not try to manipulate her by threatening suicide, these are actual feelings in the moment, but that would be impossible for me to tell if I am suffering from mental illnesses. I am verbally abusive and emotionally abusive. I say the worst things ever to the person I care about the most. Terrible things.

I am self-centered and incredibly insecure with a giant ego. I think I have Narcissistic characteristics if not some well-disguised sociopathic tendencies. I have constant negative self-talk that feeds a volatility that is hard to control after a certain point.

I have been in therapy on and off since 2013 and a lot in the past year or two. I have called suicide hotlines, religious counselors, licensed therapists, and have a best friend who is a psychologist and wonderful friend. I cannot control my anger. 

I am a victim of sexual abuse as a child from a male family member and my violent father used me to vent his frustrations as I grew up - I was a shield for my little brother. I am in the military.

I am not trying everything I can do (hospital/ full time therapy) because I am hoping I can save my marriage and have a career at the same time. It may be too much to have both.

I don't know what to do.

I don't want to be abusive. I don't think I can live if my wife leaves me. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. I don't want to die, but I so think about it often.

Every time he gets sick, his dad calls him useless and basically insults him until he has a breakdown. When my boyfriend isn't sick, his dad still insults him as much as possible while his mother stands by and does nothing. Since I live in Europe, I can't help him too much other than skyping/video calling.

aucmjp,Stress headaches following years of abuse.,"After years of abuse, including one major concussion and potentially other minor ones, I've started having stress headaches whenever he starts verbally abusing me. A thick band of pain over more forehead, a lot of pressure like my head is bursting from its skull, and sensitivity to light and sometimes sound. Holding my head really hard helps, as does hiding in the dark under blankets, heat, etc.

I was just wondering if anyone else started having bad headaches like this in their relationships. I've never had a headache before my concussion, and every single one I've had since has involved him.

And before you say leave him I've tried just about every route. Police, his therapist, begging him to go, talking to his parents. No one will help me, and until I figure out a way to get a car without transportation to look at cars in the middle of a Michigan winter, I have no way out myself.

auednr,How do I let myself feel those difficult emotions now that I'm finally safe?,"So I was psychologically abused and gaslit by my father. I'm finally out of that situation. I've even come to recognize it as abuse. But I can't seem to let myself feel hurt or be angry at my abuser. I just keep making excuses for him and feeling guilty for even trying to get better. 

I think a part of me is afraid to be angry at him but I'm not sure why. I still care about him a lot so maybe that's a part of it?

I know I need to be able to feel all of those difficult emotions to be able to heal but I don't think I know how to. Any advice?

aueulh,"Removed from relationships, I suppose I’ve established I’m in an abusive marriage. Is there any way to salvage it? Can we fix this?","This is going to be extremely long apologies in advance. And I’m on mobile, so further apologies for formatting issue(s) 

My husband (21M) and I (21F) met in high school, I was his first serious girlfriend and he was my second serious boyfriend. We hit it off, things weren’t super serious at first just a normal high school relationship but things escalated very quickly due to family circumstances*. 

(*F.C. My mother was severely abusive in every sense of the word; physically, psychologically, allowed boyfriends to abuse me physically and sexually, ect. In 2013 she allowed me to go live with my father, he tragically ended up passing just 3 months later, I lived with his fiancée family for the remainder of that school year and then went back to my mothers. The psychological/emotional abuse escalated, I developed an eating disorder, I was severely depressed and in March 2014 I tried to end my life. Upon my release from the psychiatric facility my mom told my boyfriends mom (now MIL) that she could no longer handle taking care of me, and that she shouldn’t have had children. She then kicked me out, and my now MIL took me in. 

So for my senior year of high school we lived together in his moms house, things were going great given my mental health at the time. I was so grateful to be brought into such a loving family, since then they have been my only family. I am extremely low contact, bordering no contact with my birth family due to the earlier-mentioned abuse. 

Shortly after I graduated he proposed, we began planning our wedding, I was finishing EMT school, everything seemed so perfect. As anyone could have probably called, I ended up pregnant very quickly, despite being on the birth control shot (about 7 months out of high school.) We were shocked, but came around quickly, my husband switched schools and graduated early to accelerate his ship off date for OSUT (Army infantry training for those who don’t know) He went off to training, and I completed phlebotomy school, and continued working until the near end of my pregnancy. He made it home just in time for baby, literally I was in labor picking him up from the airport. I had a very traumatic delivery, but alas we were together again with our new baby. Things still seemed picture perfect. 

Less than 2 weeks later we moved cross country (From the west coast to the east coast DMV area) with our little family to our brand new apartment and started our adult lives together. Life punched us in the face to say the least, our baby ended up very very ill and in the PICU, my husband was very unhappy with his duty station, and he really hated being a parent and subsequently refused to help out, wouldn’t go to the appointments/specialists/emergency room trips. I had severe postpartum depression and OCD, and was likely very difficult to be around. I was always angry, I cried constantly, I could barely keep up with meals and cleaning, (he wouldn’t help because I was a SAHM) I was hardly sleeping, I certainly wasn’t prioritizing our marriage, and while I realize that now, I didn’t then. Around 6 months old my son began getting better, and my mental health stabilized. But I guess by then the damage was done. 

During that time my husband was failing PT tests and tape tests, he said it was my fault for not encouraging him to do better and insisting that he help around the house and with our child. He had also begun communicating with women on social media, and various other websites, (tinder, whisper, kik, craigslist, pof, ect.) When I found out I was devastated, I confronted him he cried and apologized, told me he was sorry and that it would never happen again and that he loved me so very very much. We brushed it under the rug and I tried to forget about it, I felt like it was my fault and that I deserved it. Gradually, things got worse than before, now he wasn’t just not helping but he was constantly telling me how much he disliked our son, how much of a bitch I was when he wouldn’t help or go to the medical appointments. He constantly told me I was boring and refused to discuss any of our marital issues despite my best efforts to tell him how I was feeling. I don’t know if I’m a poor communicator or maybe I am just a bitch, but when I would tell him I felt lonely, or that I needed help he would tell me he had a real job so that he didn’t need to help out with the house work or our child. At one point he had sent intimate pictures of me to his friends and this hurt me so deeply, but he said I should be flattered that he wanted to show me off. He said I was over exaggerating, and that I needed to calm down. He would tell me I made him feel bad about himself when I told him I felt alone, or insecure, and then even when I apologized he would give me the silent treatment. 

A few month later I caught him seeking out other women again, I got the same grand apology with the tears and all that business, but this time he said we would go to counseling (but we didn’t end up going). Every time I followed up to ask if he had made an appointment he would say he forgot, or tell me I was over reacting and that I needed to let the past go. He said I was the reason things weren’t getting better, we didn’t need counseling. I tried my best to let it go, I started to do everything I could to be the ideal housewife. We had sex every night, I stopped going to play dates and talking to my friends, I made sure the house was nearly always clean, home made dinner every night, meal prepped breakfasts and lunches, calculated his macros to make sure he was losing weight. I would try to encourage him to work out so his physical fitness would improve, this would always cause a fight, he said i didn’t understand how demanding his job was and that I shouldn’t insist he work out after being at his job all day, but then would get equally angry when he failed the next test. It was a rollercoaster for quite awhile. 

After a while I thought things were going well and we needed up pregnant again, we were excited and happy. This pregnancy was absolutely terrible, I was very ill and needed home health care and a PICC line, I ended up with sepsis and hospitalized for several weeks, the antibiotics caused preterm labor and then I was on strict bed rest. During this time our marriage absolutely fell apart, he continued his online relationships, they turned physical (thought I didn’t know this until much later) he began constantly telling me how boring I was when I wanted to talk (granted I was CONSTANTLY talking about pregnancy and medical related issues and their outcomes, that was my form of coping, and he’s not as passionate about medicine as I am), he didn’t want any involvement with my pregnancy or the delivery, he still rarely helped around the house, or with our son, he told me I was dramatic and that pregnancy couldn’t possibly be that bad, he was angry when I was hospitalized and he needed to take leave to care for our son and insisted I find friends to watch him instead, he was constantly out with friends, I figured I wouldn’t complain because I imagined I was very hard to deal with at the time and maybe that was his way of coping, but near the end of my pregnancy he was sleeping at home only twice per week. I had never felt so worthless before in my life, I constantly apologized I know most of this was likely caused by me but nothing I did was never enough to make up for it.

After our baby came things again settled down, our first child adjusted well to the baby, his family came out to help and visit. He was passing PT tests and tape tests, he got promoted. All was well, for awhile. The bickering started again, and then one night he and his friends had been drinking, I came out of the room because they were being loud and waking the kids, I asked that they quiet down, he rolled his eyes and said okay. They got even louder a few minutes later and this time the baby began crying, I got frustrated and asking him to come into the hallway and snapped at him saying that they needed to shut up because I was trying to get the kids to sleep, unless he wanted to do it. He got very angry and shoved me against the wall and told me to stop being such a bitch. He claims this never happened, or that he doesn’t remember it. I told my psychiatrist about this and he reported it the the family advocacy program and things got even more strained at home.. A few weeks later I found out about his physical affairs, coupled with some family emergencies back home I couldn’t tend to, and the usual life stresses associated with two kids under two years old, I ended up as an inpatient in the psychiatric unit for a week, they expressed they felt I was in a dangerous situation at home, and was being abused. They said my husband’s behavior and demeanor during our family meeting and their private discussion with him was very concerning and they were initially reluctant to send me home. 

After this we really did go see a marriage counselor, but I was scared to bring up our heavier issues as I wasn’t sure how my husband was going to react when we got home. He began failing pt tests and tape again, and this was again my fault as I had slipped up on the meal planning and whatnot. I was followed more closely by my psychiatrist and ever since we’ve just been in limbo, some weeks were great (he helped out much more with the kids, helped around the house sometimes even before I asked him to, gave me compliments, listened to me more without getting angry), some terrible (telling me I was a bitch, baselessly accusing me of sleeping with his friends, telling me entire conversations didn’t happen despite me vividly remembering them, silent treatment when I tried to talk to him) , it’s just a never ending cycle at this point. 

Three days ago I found out that he has continued his infidelity, he says he’s going to being seeing his therapist again, and made us a marriage counseling appointment. We’re currently at a strong bond marriage seminar thing that had been previously planned. I’m not sure what to do. I want things to get better, I want him to be happy, and I want to be happy. I’ve asked him so many times what else I can do and he never says anything, he just rolls his eyes or sighs when I speak to him, he gets defensive when I tell him how I feel and I always apologize for making him feel bad but let him know it’s not my intention. I am soooo careful planning what to say to him, but he always gets angry and then I feel like it’s my fault. Even here, earlier I mentioned that I wanted to talk about something, I didn’t even say what, and he got mad and just walked away from me. I still have the apartment spotless when he comes home, I cook dinner almost every night, I still meal-prep breakfasts as dinners, I don’t ask for help anywhere near as much as I did before, and when I do it’s only something like brining the laundry upstairs, or taking the trash out when he goes to his car in the morning. I try so hard to communicate with him, but he will not discuss our issues with me. When I asked why he cheated he tells me he doesn’t know, and he thought he wouldn’t get caught. But he tells me he loves me and he wants me to stay. I feel like my mental health is deteriorating, I have times where I honestly question whether or not arguments or conversations we had were real because he says they didn’t happen, or happened extremely different from what I remember. I feel like I’ve altered my values as a parent to appease him, and he’s still unhappy. He doesn’t want me working or going to school, so I stay home even though it makes me so unhappy. I go to the gym about 5 times per week, but today he said that me not being home at night and going to the gym instead of to bed with him at 9 is part of why he was talking to other women, but I feel like it’s the only thing keeping me somewhat functional. I feel like I’ve lost every other part of myself, my psychiatrist still expresses he believes Im being abused, I just don’t know what to do. 

If you read all of this, you’re a saint, if not I don’t blame you. 

TL;DR: Married my high school sweetheart, things were perfect then went to shit, now we’re on a seemingly never ending cycle of happy, turbulent, shitty. I feel like I’m doing all I can, but it’s not good enough. I love him so so so much, and he says he loves me too, but he hasn’t changed and I’m not sure he will. I don’t want to break up my family and I also have no other support for myself and our two children . I feel like this is all, or at least predominantly my fault, but we can’t keep doing this. Other people have expressed concerns of abuse, but I’m having a hard time rationalizing it. Is this abusive? If so, is there any way we could recover from this? I feel like traditional marital counseling made things worse, is there something that is a better fit for our situation?",hobo_joe_,2019-02-24 16:48:00,2,2446,19.9,60.33,61.1,8.94,28.11,15.94,93.7,58.63,21.95,17.62,9.44,1.84,0.12,5.64,0.57,4.33,3.6,12.1,8.87,6.79,8.5,2.37,19.62,4.91,2.62,1.39,0.78,1.84,5.81,2.21,3.6,0.2,1.19,0.94,16.64,2.09,0.57,0.53,6.05,12.51,1.92,1.68,2.13,2.37,1.8,3.92,2.45,0.37,1.06,0.98,2.82,0.37,1.47,0.45,0.7,10.26,4.62,1.59,2.74,1.55,0.82,9.24,7.81,1.06,15.17,2.33,5.31,7.73,2.04,0.9,1.55,0.08,0.04,0,0.61,0.25,0.08,0.12,0.16,0,14.02,3.43,6.34,0.04,0.08,0.2,0,0.08,0,2.45,1.19,0.2

aug62x,Removed from relationships. I don't know how to approach my best friend when I knew she was being abusive and manipulative to the guy she's dating.,"English is not my first language and I am on mobile so please excuse any grammatical errors or typographical errors that I might commit. So on to the story...

I met Rinko (not her real name) in 2016 when we were still in university. To give a little background, we were blockmates back then (it's a group of students with the same course that have the same schedule for all subjects/classes that need to be taken according to the curriculum). We became close after we got to talking about our lives and I found out that she had a really rough home life. She would sometimes attend classes with several bruises on her legs and would tell everyone that she just fell down the stairs or tripped on a sidewalk or any accident that she could think of. When I knew what she was going through, I became protective of her. I always tried to catch up with her and ask about how she's doing. So we became close after that. 


In 2017, one of our blockmates and one of her close friends, Lon (not his real name too) expressed interest in Rinko. He told everyone that he had a crush on her and it was for a good reason. Rinko is smart and funny. She topped exams even when she told me that the night before, her mother was strangling her (this is because her mother blamed her for the death of a younger sibling who was run over by a car when they were still super young). I thought she was doing very well despite all of that. She still talked to me about suicide and depression but never really gave anything away other than being really lonely. I supported her and told her that if she ever wanted to seek professional help, that I would accompany her. But she didn't think she needed it.


Recently, she started opening up about her budding relationship with Lon.  She told me that she was annoyed that he would only want to take long walks with her at night after working and that he didn't take her out on fancy dinner dates. I thought this was just a miscommunication on their part. So I told her to tell him how she feels about all of those things so that there can be a compromise. I thought it was just a silly problem and something that can be easily solved through proper communication. 


Yesterday, another close friend of mine talked to me about Lon. She told me that he opened up on what was happening between him and Rinko and I was truly shocked to know the truth. He showed her text messages of Rinko when they were fighting telling him to go online on Messenger or else his family will die. Another message read ""I hope your mother had you aborted instead"" and another read ""I wish your whole family will die! Along with your stupid dog!"". She even told me a story when Lon got a new phone and Rinko immediately snatched it from him and asked for the password. When he didn't give it to her, she punched him in the face. Then asked again. Lon tried to take away the phone but when Rinko got mad, she threw the phone on the street and repeatedly broke it until it was no longer working. 

When Lon went home, his whole family found out what happened with his phone. They thought it was run over by a truck. So the whole family went to Rinko's place and demanded an apology and payment for the phone. She paid for it but asked for forgiveness repeatedly. Lon's mother didn't want to accept the apology but Lon's sisters and father gave Rinko a second chance. They invited her to dinner after that. But when the dinner was over, Rinko told Lon that the dinner was ""disgusting"" and that she thought it tasted like ""dog food"". Lon also had several marks from being pinched hard by Rinko. There were a lot of clear cases of physical and verbal abuse as well as manipulation to Lon. My close friend also told me that the only reason they were able to talk was because Lon ignored Rinko's attempts to stop him from seeing his friends and Rinko's threats for him to die. Also, when Lon tried to leave Rinko, she threatened suicide. A lot of these and more happened to Lon and I really feel awful for him.
 

Now, I know that Rinko has always told Lon that I was the only one who understood her(but not to this extent!). I know that because she says so in her stories. Also, Lon doesn't want to talk to me about Rinko because he thinks I'll be biased. My friends told me that they think I'm the only one who can talk some sense to Rinko but I know this is something that's going to require professional help. Lon has already decided to stop talking to Rinko but she has been going crazy, calling him almost non stop for the whole day. I'll admit that I am quite unsure how to approach Rinko about this. She did tell me just now that she was hurting that Lon ""broke up"" with her and that she was so sad. I tried to reason with her that it's better for her to let him go, that she can just focus on herself for now. I told her again that we should go see a psychiatrist instead to help her sort out her feelings. She then told me that she wants to commit suicide again. I don't know how to talk to her anymore after this. I honestly had no idea about this side of her because she has always been nice to me and has never made me feel bad in our entire friendship. So now I'm at a loss on how I should go about this whole situation. I don't want to just drop out of her life because of this since she's suicidal. 


Tl;dr: My college best friend opened up to me about her relationship with a friend, I thought they had miscommunication problems. Turns out she was abusing and manipulating the guy. I'm now unsure how to help her.",MasterNoFucksGiven,2019-02-24 19:07:47,0,1080,25.68,86.07,12.74,17.67,17.42,12.78,91.85,60.93,22.78,15.83,5.19,0.83,0.37,8.7,0.74,6.94,4.17,14.35,8.33,7.96,8.06,1.48,19.17,3.06,1.76,2.31,0.74,2.04,4.44,1.94,2.5,0.37,0.93,0.65,19.26,1.02,0.93,7.04,2.41,12.96,3.52,2.04,1.85,2.04,1.57,2.96,1.76,0.37,0.56,0.65,1.3,0.19,0.46,0,0.65,8.33,3.52,1.3,2.31,1.2,1.11,9.07,8.33,1.3,13.06,2.22,5,5.93,1.57,0.46,0.56,0.19,0,0.74,0.19,0,0,0,0.19,0,12.22,5.83,1.76,0.09,0.09,0,0.28,0,0.93,2.22,0.93,0.09
augsaz,Would this be abuse?,"I don’t know if there’s a better subreddit for this, but it still messes me up years later, my grandmother, lets call her Mary, used to call me a lot when I was between the ages of 6-9 and seemed really cool, I was super excited to see her since the last time i had seen her was when I was a baby. She always told stories about my father and baby stories of me.

This is where things turn. She did end up coming when I was 10, which was incidentally right around when my dog died, so I was crushed since my dog was my only support system and kids in my class were bullying me because my dog died. I was a chubby kid(bigger bodytype, it will be important later), and my sister was skinny, I’m a size 12 now and she’s a size 2, and got a lot of bullying for that too, so I was and am still very insecure about my body type.

When my grandmother came, she stayed in my sisters room since she had the biggest room of us all. One day I came home completely crushed after being bullied at school and decided to talk to Mary about it, she said that it’s not like I’d make it anywhere anyway, what would it matter if i was being bullied if I was destined for the gutter, needless to say I was crushed, the last person in my family I could have trusted in my family spat my trust in my face.

I’d like to say that was it, but it wasn’t, my mother gave me rants on my worthlessness before I’d go to school, and then reprimand me for anything she could when I got home, including a particular instance where she punished me for holding my own toy(no context needed, i came home crushed and wanted something to hold on to) and yelled at me, saying that people like me were the reason my generation would never make it anywhere, and when I cried because I was yelled at, she would yell at me for crying. I ended up developing an eating disorder because food was the only comfort that I could find, making my weight another issue, whenever I took more food, Mary would yell at me later for being ‘fat’, and how I was a waste of space.

Because my sister didn’t get bullied at school for having my dog die, or the bullying because of size, or any of the issues I had with Mary, I believed her, I have worked hard for years to shed my extra weight, and I now have problems with manic depression and anxiety along with the remnants from my disorder. I didn’t tell anyone this happened because I had similar problems with my parents and was severely bullied at school, so I assumed everyone’s home was like this and only found out about 2 years ago that that’s not true.

So that’s my story, sorry for such a long post :| , It needs context to make sense, if you have questions I’ll try and answer them, thanks in advance for helping me out.",mad_is_a_johnlockian,2019-02-24 20:14:18,2,538,18.23,22.86,83.95,9.69,41.38,13.2,91.26,61.71,22.3,16.54,13.38,0.37,0.19,2.42,0.19,5.76,3.9,13.2,11.52,6.88,8.55,1.49,21.19,4.09,2.79,2.42,1.3,1.3,5.76,2.23,3.53,0.37,1.12,1.49,9.48,2.23,0,3.53,0.19,12.64,2.04,2.97,3.16,3.35,1.12,2.6,2.79,0.37,1.49,0.74,1.86,0.93,0.19,0,1.12,6.51,1.49,0.93,2.42,1.3,0.74,10.97,7.25,0.93,14.5,1.49,6.13,6.88,1.3,0.56,1.49,0,0,0.56,0.37,0,0,0.19,0,0.19,14.13,2.23,7.25,0.19,0,0.19,0,0.19,0.19,2.97,0.74,0.19

aujuys,"I was molested, I think? Maybe?","First post, never even really used reddit at all until my current girlfriend so this is all pretty new. As a quick warning there will be a lot of I don’t knows in this. I don’t know a lot about what happened and I don’t know if I want to know. I don’t know where to turn so this was what my early morning, tired ass brain thought was a good idea. 

I think I was molested as a child. I’ll first go over some relevant set up. My biological father was a cunt. He was addicted to sleeping pills and was an alcoholic. He hit my mother and broke glass. I remember my mom telling me to hide in my room by a dresser, that’s it I don’t know why or context but I think that has some implications of its own. They divorced when I was maybe 6 or 7 and I saw him at a park for 10 minutes and left never seeing him again. No contact as we moved a state away and he just moved on to the next poor woman. I am sure I have many half brothers and sisters I will never meet. After that it was over I don’t remember feeling anything about this and moved in with my mothers parents and went to kindergarten the following year. For reference I am 17 now. Now for the fun part.

I’ll tell what I know, or what I think I know. I vividly remember talking to a police officer  on my dining room table with my mother there. She had red hair and had a fuller body, the police officer. I don’t remember the conversation other than where did he touch you? I remember prior to this going alone with my bio. fathers parents on a trip. I remember being in a motel type place with a basket ball court. I wanted to go down and play there I think. So my grandmother (not meaning to imply I think of her as my family, but for simplicity’s sake I’ll call his parents grandmother and grandfather) went to a vending machine to get donuts. The white powder ones, as I remember, and I was with my grandfather on the balcony walkway to go to the basketball court, but we never went down there. That’s all, regarding this “trip”, that I remember. 

Now these by themselves are not damning, maybe I remembered wrong or I’ve fabricated this, but there’s more after the fact. The only time something of this has been brought up within my family was when my adopted father (pretty good guy, has faults but who doesn’t) made an off hand comment while talking about my mother that she’s protective because my boi fathers father was a pedophile/ molester. 
I’ve always thought about the trip and police incidents throughout my life but I never understood them. I knew what the implication was but I didn’t tell anyone and forgot about it. Never asked my mother. And haven’t had any depression or anxiety as a result, to my knowledge. I thought about it intensely about three years ago, though. I then started feeling ashamed and embarrassed about being a rape victim. Even though I didn’t even know if it really happened. So to try and understand it I did what any reasonable person would do and turned to talking to pedophiles on the internet. What happened is not important but more the action. I just played along, I knew they were grooming me but I was in control the whole time. I never got in big trouble and I’m over that now but I did it for a while and I don’t know why. I’m starting to think it might be related. 

Now to the point I’m thinking about maybe trying to go to my hometown and looking for police reports when I turn 18. I don’t know if this is a good idea though. I’m not worried about what I’ll find but what if I made it up. What if I’m a liar and got this man in trouble for no reason. What if it never happened. And what if it did. The only person I’ve ever told about what I think I remember and the surrounding relevant information is my current girlfriend. I’m pretty trusting and open once I get to know someone. I told her this pretty much as a joke. Most of my humor is “dark” and “dry”. She told me about her self harm scars. Nothing too serious and she’s much better know and not likely to go back to doing anything destructive. But I sarcastically said “That’s nothing, I was raped as a child.” She didn’t believe me at first. After I explained, and oh so humorously joked about molestation and self harm within a month of dating an absolutely gorgeous girl, she said that’s fucked and she’s so sorry. The reason for me telling this is that my demeanor and response was that if a joke. I didn’t make it a big deal even to myself. I didn’t have any emotion towards it and so I’m not afraid of finding out the truth. 

I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe to get it off my chest or for attention. I really can’t tell. As I guess the theme of this is I don’t know it’s fitting really. Maybe someone can help or give advice on what to do going forward. I am a little worried about it if it is true. I don’t know how to be a rape victim or molester victim or whatever. Kidding, of course, or maybe not.

auk51f,My entire life I was manipulated and psychologically abused. I don’t know what to do.,"If I vent here or give too much information, I sincerely apologize. I wanted to give sufficient context to my plight.

I am a 19 year old male, born into a family with sufficient income. I have left a domestic abuse situation, one which covered everything except sexual abuse and blatant physical assault. My entire life has been one of much isolation and increasing psychological abuse and manipulation. My father was very controlling and kept the entire family in a vice grip, justifying his unusual and damaging actions as head of the house by saying it was what God told him to do. Apparently God told him to never get medical service unless someone is literally about to die (this includes not getting my sister the proper psychiatric help for her severe OCD) avoid getting a water heater after it broke long ago, allow next to no outside real-world contact, etc.

My brother, whom I left my situation with, is in his mid twenties, and he has had no avenue of escape, much like me. We were never offered the opportunity to grow and gain real world experience, nor get a job to earn money. We were forced to become drastic and were even able to get police officers to drive us to a shelter (though they didn’t seem too convinced of our situation; they kept asking us why we didn’t just leave, despite us telling them we had no way to leave).

We were able to find much more suitable living conditions after we were in contact with an agency that specialized in domestic abuse. It is a little emasculating, being a 19 year old male in a situation mostly females come from. But in any case, the agency is helping us get food stamps, licenses, GEDs, and jobs. I am in a sort of mental crisis, however, because the more I explain my situation to the people here, the more things they say were abuse. I was so used to it my entire life, I am frankly shocked.

My life has been a mistake, and I don’t know how to lift myself from this pit. I have a flurry of emotions for my father (who may have even been cheating on my mother). I also have similar notions towards my mother, who allowed this to happen ( however, she, too, was abused in her past, and I think she is too accustomed to abuse to spot it anymore).

I have next to no friends nor relations I can rely on, and I am truly alone. I’m expected to build a life from the ground up, and it is overwhelming. You know the dragons we all must face in our lives? In my case, I was born in a dragon’s stomach, already devoured. Depression (even self harm to a degree) has haunted me off and on for many years, and I do not know if I can finish this race.

Do you have any advice for me? Anything at all?",WaywardMarcher,2019-02-25 03:14:44,2,516,45.11,55.39,52.12,1,19.11,16.67,91.28,56.4,17.64,13.37,7.95,2.52,0.39,1.74,0.78,4.26,5.23,13.37,10.08,4.84,6.01,2.71,17.44,2.52,1.55,1.55,0.97,3.1,5.23,0.78,4.26,0.39,1.94,0.97,12.21,1.55,0.58,1.55,1.94,12.4,2.52,2.13,1.36,2.33,2.52,3.1,0.78,0,0.39,0.19,3.1,0.58,1.94,0.19,0.39,9.3,3.88,1.16,2.71,1.74,0.58,6.4,10.27,0.39,10.85,1.55,5.81,3.49,1.94,0.39,0.97,0.39,0.39,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.92,4.65,6.2,0,0.19,0.58,0,0.19,0,1.16,1.94,0
auke4o,This is a vent im trying to spread.,"***i typed all of this out for a different post, and im too lazy to retype because it was draining. My psychiatrist told me to start talking about my frustration instead of bottling it up, because ive begun self harming without even realizing it do to anxiety and frustration. This forces me to talk about it when people ask questions***

Ill have you all know, my psychiatrist referred me to this post after my first visit with him after being diagnosed with ptsd. Its a very long story, even with skipping a lot of parts. This is my entire life story as a rant because im mad about the thing that happened today. This all started seventeen years ago tho so... yep get some popcorn and im pissed

Skip to end for short version


The first part of this story is what i remember to the best of my knowledge from a few memories i have of left of this time that were horrible.

My mother accidentally got pregnant with me when i was little and lied to my dad and said she had a miss carriage until she was past the time to have an abortion. Just under a year after i was born she ran away with me to her boyfriends house and they got married. We lived in a small apartment with his own daughter, i was so young i dont even remember her name. She would kick me and scream at me to stop crying after. When this began i was made to sleep in a crib in my mother and her husband at night. I always had to sleep on one particular side so they could “do the do” without me watching. According to my mother if i didnt he would slap me. I was a baby and she had no reason to lie. 

About a year or so after they divorced and we lived with my grandma (mom’s side) but i dont remember that part but one with a cat. 
About another year later we moved to a college campus and told no one, not even my father or anyone else in my family. I must have been about 2 or 3 
my dad and her werent married so she was able to demand child payments which is what we lived off of for the first years of my life (she didnt have a job, and she was at school all day) we moved multiple times to hide from my father after she would allow him to see me to get money from him. 

She told me he didnt want me, he hated me, and that he tried to kill himself when he found out she was pregnant (sadly this was partially true and i found out later). I didnt believe her because i thought she was the crazy one.
This began when i was about 3. 

We moved all the time so we never unpacked any of our stuff. She packed everything together cause she was always rushing, so a lot of our things would be mixed. All the time shed have to go through all of my stuff to get to hers, shed carefully go through one box at a time getting sloppier and sloppier until she got so frustrated shed just empty the box upside down all over the floor. This happened almost every day, and every day she would scream at me to put everything back in the boxes (and she expected me to sort them so she didnt have to do it later again) and would sit there watching me do it and would scream at me if i stopped (this was a bunch of little tiny things in giant boxes, i was three years old it took me some time when it was all over the floor) she never told me how to sort anything, and i always did it wrong some how. Or something would always happen and id get distracted because i was young or there would be so much crap id want to play with.
If i stopped shed scream at me, shed sometimes sneak around the corner and watch me playing with things instead of cleaning after she trashed my room again, then after a bit shed sneak up behind me and scream at me as loud as she could about being an idiot and yank my hair and sometimes slap me. I know this is when i was about 4-5 because this is when we moved twice in the same apartment complex. 
Her violence escalated when i began elementary school about a year after this happened (i am right at the cut off age point i started a year ahead)
She became lazier, she wouldnt do the dishes, she made me, shed play video games or watch tv and make me SWEEP her CARPET when we had a vacuum and she would speak to me in this mocking voice about how “if you clean faster you can eat dinner later” 
She never let me.
Shed pile up dishes for a week, all microwave food she taught me how to make for her. If i was caught eating without permission i would be hit and kicked until i was screaming and begging her to stop. The neighbors called the cops so many times. 
Sometimes it was days before shed let me eat or i would sneak food sometimes, but she would always find out and beat the crap out of me. 

To sum this part up She barely let me eat at all and i couldnt grow when i was little now im fucking 5’1” because of her.

This made it hard to do dishes because i was tired because of school and always weak and dizzy and sick. So id take a long time to do a weeks worth of dishes. She had school and so did i, so id go to a day care center, go to school, then another day care center while my mom did god knows what and id get home at 8 pm.
This is when everything became truly violent. 
She would go to bed at night and id stay up doing the dishes. Id be exhausted so id have to sit down every once in a while on the chair i had to stand on to reach the sink. If she caught me she would scream at me and stand there with her arms crossed all mad like and watch me do the dishes until she got tired and left. Id finish them all, then usually go to bed
Sometimes i wouldnt finish. Id be too tired. Id sit on the chair for a sec and then fall asleep. Then id really get it in the morning. I remember she began keeping me home from school, she would scream “WHAT DID I TELL YOU TO DO” and once sprayed me in the eyes with clothing stain remover. 

I went blind for a week

This continued every day and night for years, i did everything for her, i cleaned, i brought her stuff in the shower, i did the dishes i made her food and i became a master at sneaking food. 

My dad finally took her to court to get visitation and me, my mom, and her new boyfriend all moved to a new apartment about half an hour away from my dad. My mom didnt enroll me in the third grade until halfway into the semester and i would lie to my dad and say i had a great time at school. 
Visitation was rough, they began criticizing everything about me immediately when i would get to their house (my dad lived with his mother at the time)
I didnt know how to act with them and they took all of my questions as “attitude.” They would tell my mother i was rude to them and she would scream at me after they left. 

This was the norm for a while 
Then she got pregnant

One time well before this at some point she was about to hurt me and i shut my bedroom door at just the right time that she fell and damaged the cartilage in both of her knees (she had periods of time when she would be reasonable and kind and sweet and apologize and she would cry and hold me and told me to run to my room and lock it when she was upset) 
She was always in pain after that, and while pregnant with my baby sister she took some pain medicine she wasnt supposed to while pregnant, and my sister became sick when she was a year old. Guess who cleaned up all the vomit.
Some after my sister was born and i was enrolled in school finally, i broke my pinky after i fell into a gym room door and it got caught in the hinges as it was closing. My mom decided that was the perfect day to test the new stroller and walk to come get me, even though she had a new car from her dad. 

One night we got in an argument. My mom was drunk, she had the baby in her arms after i cleaned up her vomit again and changed her diaper and fed her. She was cooing over her and playing with her, making her make cute faces. She was drinking and noticed me sneaking into the kitchen to get food. She put the baby down and grabbed me by my hair and dragged me over to the wall by my room and started hitting and kicking me screaming “what did i tell you” over and over. She told me nothing. I couldnt stop crying so she put her hand over my mouth and nose so i couldnt breathe. I bit her as hard as i could and she started screaming at me and hitting me. Then she got the lighter. 
This repeated a few times this week, then the last day i was with her she forced me to drink alcohol too. I dont remember a lot that happened until the police got there thankfully. 
Rumpleminz isnt as christmas-y when youre eight years old

I know the neighbors finally got fed up with my screaming and called the cops. I remember finally telling the cops the truth after 8 years
I hadnt showered or slept in days and i was up until 3 am that night. 
I found out i was gonna go to my dads house and passed out

I had then had visitation of my mother for a while, and every day was the same with my dad. Him and his mom werent expecting someone as broken as me. I ate everything and my grandma told me id get fat and that i should be proud of how skinny i am. My dad said nothing and stayed in his room every day and ignored me.

Sometimes when i was with my mom she would make me sit in in the dark bathroom with the lights off if she was mad at me and watch the door to see if i got scared enough to turn the light on. Then id get another bruise. 
My dad couldnt comprehend my fear of the dark as a third grader (HOW IMMATURE) and they have forced me to sleep with my door closed and light off ever since. 
My mom used sleep as a reward that happened like every other day. I would rarely be allowed to sleep, so when i was allowed to with my dad, id get yelled at for not waking up on my own at 10 am. 
They criticize every little thing about me, my grades (school wasnt exactly my thing but i wasnt getting into trouble.) i wasnt allowed to have friends that were boys, but i didnt know how to be a girl, so guys were easier to talk to. 
With my mother there were some times she would be loving and caring and i knew she wasnt herself all the other times when she was cruel.


With my new family, there is never even a split second when i can feel real love from them. Every since i went to live with them they have always criticized me for everything i h said or done. They constantly say i ruined their lives and anything that goes wrong for them is usually my fault anyways so i guess its true. 
My dad and i eventually moved out and i lived with him and his girlfriend for a while, same arguments every day no matter what. 
They couldnt stand me. They told me every day i was ruining their life and so id go to my grandma’s. she was he same way but worse. She would make comments about my appearance and when id defend myself id get screamed at and sent back to my dads. 
They began finding what i now know were ptsd triggers for me and when i told them why it bothered me when i did those things (cause of my mom) they would tel me to get over it or even accuse me of lying. They accused me of lying all the time because my triggers would happen during arguments and id tell them and theyd think i was using it to get out of the argument. 
A huge problem i had after the first year of living with them was sleeping at night. If he caught me awake hed scream at me. I wasnt allowed to keep my phone in my bedroom and every night my dad would go through it. 
Eventually i utilized my old my sneaking capabilities and snuck in to the kitchen every night to get my phone and began talking to people so i could relax and fall asleep.
I met a boy named named brandon (dont laugh this is sad) online and we managed to date in secret online for three years. He had gone through very similar things with his dad and we connected instantly. We had an argument ONCE because i had been contemplating suicide and i said to him “i dont think life is for me” i wish he had taken his own advice from that night. We planned to get married
My father was dating a girl he met on warframe, and they had known each other for three months before she moved in from Tennessee- ten hours away
I had known brandon for 3 years, he was from michigan. 
My father did not let me attend his funeral last may. 
After this everything went downhill. I told a friend i was going to kill myself one night and he called the cops, i now have a $4000 hospital bill to pay off, i graduated half a semester early, i have a full time job and i pay the required amount each month. Its never enough for them
On top of this after my brandon died my ptsd came through full force and i started having vision problems. They took me to my eye doctor who told em to go to my pediatrician who told em to go to a social worker and the psychiatrist who recommended me here. 
My grandma has recently become  more violent and accusatory. I have something called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome that makes me faint and get dizzy and a whole bunch of other terrible stuff, on top of the new meds i was finally taking after 6 years of begging to be seen by a psychiatrist because i was sad all the time, i wasnt feeling that great one day. I started to faint and i tripped over my dogs dish. (Yes they love her more btw but thats understandable cause i do too)
When i tripped i put a hole in my wall. This was after an argument so they think its on purpose. I was barely even able to stand at the time cause i was so dizzy.
This was three months ago.


Today slept in until 1 pm today (door shut not bothering anyone.) and my grandma comes pounding at my door and screams “DID YOU CUT MY REFRIGERATOR WITH A KNIFE” 
I was confused??
I get up half asleep and i go look. Theres a long hardly noticeable scratch going from the top of the fridge to the bottom, clearly deliberate.
I havent been home the past few nights because i was at my current boyfriend’s house. My grandpa was out of state. 
But apparently i tried to murder my refrigerator with a broken paring knife that just happened to be laying on the top of the trash.

(Also at this point i have been NC with my mother for 7 years. And i just know a bit about her from her ex fiancé who stalked me, then threatened to hurt my sisters if i didnt send him nude photos of myself or if i told someone. What i did do was really stupid but we wont discuss that here (nothing illegal).

To sum it all up:
My mom basically tortured and literally tried to kill me but was nice sometimes
Moved in with dad and grandma
Theyre both assholes but not violent
Worse mental state than with my mom because absolutely no support ever.
Use me as their scapegoat for everything
Want me to buy them a new fridge for a tiny scratch i did while at another person’s house, even though i have a hospital bill for almost killing myself that i can already barely afford because i literally just graduated from highschool three months ago.

auln8w,I've been psychologically abused by my dad for my entire life and it's getting too far,"So, I live with both my parents and my brother. My dad is disabled and my mum works. I'm 21, go to university. I have great friends and love what I study. Even though I have mental health problems and a neurological disorder, I try my best.
But what has lingered in the back of my mind until the last few years is the psychological and verbal abuse from my dad. And I'm still in denial on the regular.
Since I was a little kid,  I've had nightmares of him screaming at me. In the dark for some reason. He has never shyed away from calling me an idiot, fat, stupid, lazy. This is while yelling at me for things such as 
- him misinterpreting me as correcting him when I had only misheard him
- turning the air conditioner off while he was out because I was cold
- the toilet leaking because it wasn't bolted properly
- eating a bag of chips and him walking by and saying 'my god, how much do you eat? ' when I was about 10
- yelling at me for crying 
- disagreeing with him about same sex marriage (I'm in the closet for this reason)
- talking while he watches TV
-defending myself when he shit talks me in front of my brothers gf who is really nice 

Because of this, I had anxiety attacks as a child. I was scared of being yelled at. I hid under tables. I didn't have a lot of friends. I only really made quality friends when I was about 17. Meanwhile,  my older brother was like the second coming of Jesus to the family.

I've seen and heard of people who have great relationships with their dads. I nearly cried when I saw my friend hug her dad when he drove 4+ hours to pick her up. I was so touched today when my best friends dad gave me an Easter Bunny along with the rest of his family. It's like I don't really understand healthy masculinity. He's very particular about being a 'man'. He doesn't like people who thinks differently and Thinks because he sits and watches documentaries all day that he knows everything.

He's like this with my mum too. He talks down to her,  calls her an idiot,  yells and gets angry. She's numb,  she thinks it's normal. 

It's getting to the point where I'm actually scared that he'll get angry enough to do something physically. I'm currently at a friends house for the night, I'm going home tomorrow and then the next night I'm staying with a friend on campus. I've been frantically looking for student accommodation but it's hard atm with semester starting soon. I'm hoping to talk to a social worker, in secrecy because if he found out I could risk losing my family. My mum is thankfully supportive of me moving and offered to help out a bit financially.

I'm not really sure what I'm asking for, I still doubt myself and think it's my fault. It makes me angry that people think highly of him, while this happens behind closed doors. 

Tldr: my dad is psychologically abusing me and I'm struggling",joannecamel,2019-02-25 06:11:15,0,543,26.28,45.6,71.98,1,15.51,14.55,94.48,58.56,22.1,17.5,12.34,0,0.18,4.79,0.18,4.6,4.97,13.81,10.68,6.45,8.29,1.1,19.89,5.16,2.03,2.76,0.92,1.47,8.47,2.39,6.08,1.29,2.76,0.55,15.1,3.31,1.47,1.84,6.08,8.84,1.84,2.21,0.74,1.47,1.1,2.39,2.95,1.1,1.29,0.55,2.03,0.37,1.1,0.18,0.55,9.02,3.87,1.29,2.39,1.47,1.29,4.42,12.15,1.29,13.44,1.29,6.45,6.08,2.03,0.74,1.29,0.37,0.37,0,1.1,0.55,0.55,0,0,0,17.68,5.89,3.13,0.18,0,0.18,0,1.47,0,6.26,0.37,0.18

aup813,"To all the strangers on this sight, I am begging for your help. TW- mentions of suicide.","(I apologize for awkward wording, confusing formatting, I am kind of rambling things off. I am in a very desperate situation. I will try to clean this up as much as I possibly can to avoid confusions and so you guys can give me the best advice possible.)
I am 19. I am still living at home, part time worker, full time student.
I am in an abusive situation.
Mother - I suspect she has some kind of mental/emotional disorder. She has severe attachment issues to me. For a long time, and still now, it is hard for me to maintain relationships with people because she is very suspicious that I will “get in with the wrong crowd” and undo all the parenting she has forced on me. So because of this, it is hard for me to go out with friends and she is constantly blowing up my phone, demanding to know where I am, what I’m doing, who I’m with, etc. I once tried to tell her that I am a legal adult, and that I thought that I should have some freedoms, such as staying out past 12. This angered her so much she cornered me, screamed (I don’t mean scolded, I mean SCREAMED) at me about how the law doesn’t apply to her, and tried to beat me. She has my money in a joint account with her, so she has access to my money and she can monitor what I spend. When she gets angry at me, she demands to either take my phone away, or for me to give it to her so that she can go through it. If I refuse, she will become violent until she has my phone. She is humiliated by the fact that I have ADHD, and constantly berates me for “not being normal” and tells me that I need to learn how to act like regular people. She constantly talks about how she needs to keep me away from my father because he is the one who made me weird. I have been struggling with depression and self-harm since I was eight. When I told her that I felt that I needed to get professional help in the seventh grade, she got so violently angry at me and told me that if that’s what I wanted to do then I should kill myself, since I’m so selfish in the first place. She told me that I had no right to say that since I make her want to kill herself because of how hard I make her life. I was thirteen/fourteen. Ultimately, I feel like she only values me for my body. Constantly pressuring me to keep my virginity, by threatening me with the consequences of losing it before I get married. She hammered into my mind that I need to keep my depression, self-harm, ADHD, a secret and that I need to hold onto my virginity, and stay in college because no man would ever want me if he knew I had any flaws. 
I believe that her obsessiveness and clinginess ultimately stems from her goal to keep me as marriageable as possible, so that she can marry me to a wealthy man with a wealthy family. She wants the praise for raising such a beautiful and feminine daughter, the money from my future husband and I, and for me to bare a lot of grandchildren for her. When I reflect on her “parenting” from my childhood, it seems less like parenting, and more like raising and pampering cattle, or a show animal. I really am anxious to think about how she might have treated me had I been fat and had bad skin (ie had I been born “ugly”), or mentally/physically disabled.

Father - Only gets involved in my life when it's time to show off his strength and authority. He believes that ADHD is a “disease made up by millennial doctors so kids can get away with being lazy” (Im paraphrasing but thats more or less what he said/believes) so when I was in elementary school, he would make me sit in front of him while doing homework. Whenever I zoned out, or made a silly mistake, he would swat me upside the head. He has pretty inexplicable mood swings. For example, one week he’s be doting on me about how smart I am, how I’m too good for boys, how proud of me he is, etc. The next week he’ll be shouting at me about how I’m so lazy that I’ll never accomplish anything in life, I should just drop out of college because I don't try hard in anything. The most recent dramatic episode, was when he asked why I wasn’t wearing gloves outside in the winter. I have explained this to him several times, but he doesn’t remember. At this point, I had explained to him many, many, times why I did not have gloves. This was maybe the sixth time he asked that question. So finally, he went out, bought a large pair of mens gloves, and tried to give them to me. I did not ask him to buy me gloves. I had expressed countless of times that I did not like wearing gloves. And I couldn’t even wear the gloves he bought me because they were way too big and wouldn’t even stay on my hands. So he was very upset and hurt that I didn’t wear the gloves, and pouted and ignored me for a day or so. I remember I once tried to communicate to my father about how his behavior made me feel and I was so emotional and upset that I was sobbing hysterically. He looked at me, laughed, and then turned back around in his chair, turned the volume on the television up so he couldn’t hear me. When I was younger, I tried to fight back when he was hitting me, and I told them that he couldn’t do whatever he wanted to me just because I was his kid. He told me that as his child, I am his property and if he wanted to hit me, he would (again, paraphrasing but more or less what he said). Recently, he and I got in a fight again and I asked “you think that just because you’re my father you can say whatever horrible things you want to me and make me feel bad about myself?” and he said “yup! Absolutely.” and then closed the door on me.


Now that you get a general understanding of how my parents are, this is my situation. I need to get out as soon as possible. I am extremely depressed. I have not been able to sleep well at night because I cannot stop thinking about how I want to end my life. I am basically not allowed by my mother to go out with friends, leave the house without her permission, talk to men, be out past 8. If I try to break these rules, she will become violent. I have lied to her so that I could live a normal life, but if/when she finds out, she screams at me for literal hours about how I’m ruining the family, I’m a horrible monster, I’m heartless, I’ve ruined her life, etc., you get the point. My father can’t be bothered to step in, and when he does, it’s because he’s annoyed by her yelling and can’t hear the tv over her. I have decided that I am going to finish this semester of college, and then take a year or so off so that I can get myself in a better situation where I don’t feel like I am in physical danger or so I don’t feel like I am on the verge of ending it all. I know what kind of people my parents are, and I know that they will be very angered by this decision. They have control over most of my life and will make is as hard as possible for me to leave and take my rightful belongings with me. Also, no I do not have family. My father’s family don’t like him and have either completely cut him off, or keep very limited contact with him. I have no contact with my mother’s family because they live on the other side of the Earth, speak little to no english, and she purposely kept us apart so that I could not expose her behavior to them. Is there any advice or help anyone can give me? Legal advice, help-lines, etc.? Anything and everything is appreciated.

auycsj,Evil teacher,"Not sure if this is the right place for this story, and English is not my first language so bare with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently graduated as a mental healthcare worker. In my third year of my education i got a new teacher, lets call her ET (evil teacher). At the start of the year everybody in my class had to pick a healthcare organisation to do an internship and research project for. I was really happy with my choice, but then my organisation dropped out. I was placed (without consent) into another organisation (one i did not like at all) together with 2 classmates ( both girls). The 2 girls  did not like each other from the start. They got in a fight constantly and it got so bad that they would ask me to deliver a message to the other. This was a problem since we had to do the research paper within 6 months. After around 4 weeks our group had our weekly meeting with ET for feedback. ET did not let anyone finish speaking and interrupted constantly. I got pretty fed up with this so i told ET ( in a polite and civil manner) that interrupting people was not helpful or nice. This was the point she started hating me. I could not do a single thing right. 5 months into the project the 2 girls in my group quit, one left school, the other wanted to start over after Christmas. I could not finish the project on time so i was forced to start over. This time i could choose a organisation that i did like. Unfortunately i had to do the whole project on my own, and i still had ET as my mentor. Luckily i had a good time as in intern, the organisation i worked for was happy with me and gave me all the help i needed. I managed to finish my research project on time aswell as doing my internship tasks. These whole 6 months ET refused to give me any proper feedback. She told me i better quit with my education, i was not smart enough, i did not posses the required people skills. It started eating away at my confidence, to the point i devolved an severe anxiety disorder. I told my parents about this teacher, but they thought i overreacted ( im stubborn, but most teachers really liked me). I talked with my school counselor about it, but she was not really helpful. At the end of the 6 months ET, me and my organisation got together to give me my final grade. I already knew my organisation was happy with me, i worked on the feedback they gave me and they told me i passed the internship. I was custom that the organisation graded the student, and the teachers usually went along with this grade. I got an 8/10, witch is pretty good. However, ET did not agree. Without even reading my research paper she claimed i FAILED. I better quit school.  

I was devastated, i did work meant for 3 students all by myself in 6 months. My mom did not understand it either, so i arranged a meeting with ET, myself and my mom. To my surprise the school counselor was at the meeting as well. ET had talked to her ( and the counselor had broken her confidentially agreement). ET did not say a thing for the first 15 minutes (did not shake mine or my moms hand), let the counselor name all the things i was bad at and why i should stop school. After 15 minutes the first thing ET says is that i lacked people skills. My mom got furious (my mom is a  psychologist and a really sweet/calm person, always sees the best in people). Later on my mom told me she thought there was something wrong ( psychological ) with ET. My mom apologized for not believing me, she was shocked that someone as ET could teach. 

After the summer i switched courses, did not have ET as my teacher and i managed to do my internship and research project without any problems.

av4a6p,My best friend [F 27] is in an abusive relationship and wants to leave but can’t bring herself to do it. How can I help?,"Not sure how this sub feels about trigger/content warnings, but just in case, there’s talk of emotional and physical abuse in some detail, as well as mentions of infidelity.

I’d like to preface this by saying that I have also dealt with abuse in many forms throughout my life. My dad was emotionally abusive towards me and emotionally and physically abusive towards my mom, so I’ve seen the cycle of abuse play out. I know how hard it is to break out of and I think that’s one reason I don’t really know how to help her.

Some background: they’ve been together since high school and have two children. He has never been good to her. He’s cheated multiple times, emotionally abused her throughout their relationship (controls the finances, cuts her off from loved ones, makes her feel like she doesn’t need help, etc), and has been physically abusive on numerous occasions. He actually has a domestic violence conviction on his record already.

A few nights ago at a party, he got very drunk. When she tried to get him to slow down, he slammed her against a wall and choked her. It took three people to get him off of her. Shortly after, she caught him with another woman and he became violent again, pushing her off the porch. Their children (3 and 8) both saw the whole thing.

She told me that this time she wants to leave. This was it for her. But she’s not sure she can do it. She wants to talk to him about it first, which is concerning because of how manipulative he can be. I’m scared for her and her children.

I know from a lifetime of trying to help my mom that telling her to just do it isn’t helpful, but I don’t know what I can do. This is my best friend and I feel like I need to help somehow but I just don’t know how to.

If you’ve read this far, thank you.

av5o86,Today I did a bad thing.,"It's been a whole week and a half since by boyfriend got angry at me, and boy its been a great week and a half. I was a little depressed the first couple days, but he was there for me and so sweet. We had so much fun. We ordered pizza. We played with the cats together. It felt like family again, like it used to. But then I noticed the last day or two that his mood was changing. He seemed stressed and unhappy. I've been through this cycle over and over and I knew what was coming. It was going to happen today, I could just feel it. Finally, he made a little comment about how I talk too much and how annoying it is and I completely snapped. I yelled at him. I kicked his fan twice. Threw his shoes. I slammed a couple doors on my way out. I can't say this is the first time I've snapped at him, but it's definitely the first time I got so angry with so little provocation. Normally it takes until he is in my face screaming about how I'm a stupid slut or a bitch or piece of shit before I snap, if I snap. But today, it only took that one little comment.

I guess I just want to know, is it normal to lose your shit like this?

I've been talking with my friends about my situation lately and every time it's meant with, ""Dude that's genuinely so fucked"" and my friends calling it abusive and I guess I never thought of it that way? I just felt so dramatic and stupid for thinking that it *could* be abuse because so many people have it so much worse than I do ya know? 

I thought I'd share here I guess? I wrote this out in my google docs the other day and I think I want someone to read it. I just want someone to listen who knows what the hell to call what I'm going through. I know this isn't as bad as a lot of you are going through and I'm sorry if it's over dramatic. It's SO long I'm very sorry.

*The Case of the Girl vs. Her Mother*

When I was 9, I realized that there was something different about my home. My parents were louder than the other kids' parents, and I had more rules. I was more mature than the other kids in my grade. I had grown up so rapidly - too rapidly. At 9 years old I was so sad and scared of my mother that I wished on every star that I would disappear. I told my friends at school that I was going to kill myself. Young, naïve, and stupid, I didn't think it was more than an empty threat. I didn't truly understand the significance of that statement. I just knew I wanted to get out. This happened twice, once in third grade and again in fourth. Both times my parents were called, and bot times I got in huge trouble with them. 

In fifth grade, I had switched to homeschooling. I was only 10 years old but I was facing realities that felt like they had aged me far beyond that. I had watched a movie in secret, *Cyberbully,* and noticed in the movie that the main character attempted suicide with pills. A sea of yahoo answers and google searches later, I found out that an abundance of sleeping pills could kill you. I began to plot. 

My parents had been gone for a couple of hours and I was going to be home alone until that evening. I realized now was the time to take action. I searched for my fathers' sleeping pills, to no avail. I searched his room and the bathroom but found them nowhere. My dad had usually always had them out and available. I don't know why they were hidden that day, but I truly believe some force shielded my eyes. And in just a strange coincidence, I logged onto my computer to search for different methods or ways to run away, another frequent search query of mine - and an ad for the suicide hotline showed up. I called from my home telephone, telling them I was 14. I remember being sure that no one would ever help a 10 year old. 

I didn't tell them the whole truth about why I was so hurt. My mother had told me over and over growing up that if I told people how I felt, or how my mom made me feel, that we would be taken away to live with a different family. I don’t think that's true, but when I look back on it now, that's a major red flag. I see many red flags looking back I had never noticed. When I was 8, I came home from school in tears to tell my parents I didn't think I believed in God. I thought they were going to kick me out. I was terrified. They talked to me for hours. My parents cried. I felt like I had failed my parents, and if God did exist, I knew I had failed him too.

I told them I was sad about my grandfathers passing, and that my mother yelled at me a lot. I told them my parents didn't understand that I was hurting. I left it at that, and the woman on the hotline was sympathetic and warm. I trusted her. I shouldn't have.

I know that it was her job to call back, and maybe it wasn't her intention to talk to my mother in the first place. I don't know what happened on her second phone call. All I know is that she called back, and my mother answered. It still haunts me to think about. I was on the computer in the basement and my mother stormed in.

""The suicide hotline called. Nice to know you're fourteen.""

My stomach flipped. It flipped so roughly that I still feel it now in the darkest pits of myself. I waited for her to finish talking to the woman I had spoken to. In that moment, I had never wished more to have been dead. When my mom came back in, she didn't speak at first. She pointed at the door to her room and I went in. I sat on the couch for two hours in silence as she screamed at me. She screamed until her throat went hoarse. She was not scared. She was not sad. She didn't stop for a moment to even ask me why I felt that way. She screamed at me about how the woman must have thought her a bad mother. She screamed at me about my selfishness. She called me a murderer and a liar.

She called me everything but broken. Everything but a child so scared that they would rather die than face another day.

That night I went to the bathroom before bed and my mother swung the door in while I was using the restroom.

""I'm just making sure you're not doing anything stupid"", My mother snarled.

My father didn't come home until the next day. He sat on my bed and told me that God would be angry if I had killed myself. He did not yell. He was fearful, more for my soul than me, but I cannot blame him. He never knew the things my mother had done the night before. He never knew the rage she had for the child she had broken.

I don't think he ever knew who she was. I don't think anyone did.

After that, I continued to grow emotionally stunted. I whored myself out to men on the internet to feel loved and wanted. I started self harming when I was 12 because I thought that having scars would make the things I was feeling real. I had such disordered eating at 13. I'd go days without eating and then binge. I don't talk about that much.  My relationship with food was so flawed because of my mother. I never could talk about it because I didn't want to become another fat-girl-thinks-she-has-an-excuse cliché (which is fucked up but regardless). My mother would scream at me about how the world would hate me because I was fat and ugly. She never stopped telling me that the ""world was hard for fat girls"". She told me I'd be prettier if I looked like my thinner friend. She judged and hated my thin friends. She constantly would remind me how much she wished she had anorexia. I'm not proud to admit that I did too. Do too. The thought of being sick and thin and breakable is so hypnotic to me. I hate that about myself.

When I told her I had a crush on a boy, but he was very cute and popular, she told me that sometimes good looking boys end up with ugly girls. I knew I wasn't pretty but that was a brutal thing to hear from my own mother. Why wouldn't she have just said anything else.

Why couldn't my own mother love me the way the other girls' mothers did.

I sought that motherly love in the arms of a girl at my theatre who had taken me under her wing. I adored her. It wasn't long before I called her mom, and subsequently, her boyfriend my dad (not in the sex way). They kept tabs on me. Skyped me when I had nightmares (which were frequent, and stay frequent). When my mother looked through my phone one night, she found the girl's contact with the name ""mom"" when her name was ""mother"". Furious, she made me look up and read her the definition of mom vs. the definition of mother. There was not much of a difference, and it did not articulate her point. She was angry and jealous. She got defensive whenever I talked about the girl. She refused to let me post or call the theatre a ""second home"" or anyone my ""second family"". She was so afraid of being replaced. She gave long lectures about how that was disrespectful and how I was replacing her. I learned quickly that there was only one way to love other people - secretly.

On the way home from rehearsal one night, my mother noticed cuts on my arm and demanded an explanation. After so long lying to her saying I had scratched a mosquito bite, I finally said it was self harm. I crossed my fingers begging for this to be the moment she realized how broken I had become.

""If you go too deep, they'll kick you out"".

All my mother had told me was that my theatre would fire me if I went too deep. That's it. That's all. That's all my own mother had to say about seeing her daughter's (fresh) self harm marks.

When I was 15, past all the moments before, I had hit rock bottom. I was horrifically mentally ill. So was my mother. I was in an awful place in my life. I took an insane amount to painkillers in attempt to kill myself. In a long winded stream of events, I ended up downstairs telling my mom what had happened. She huffed, and the first thing she said when I had *attempted suicide* was,

""What am I supposed to tell the doctor when they ask if you're suicidal now?""

She then sent me back upstairs, ignoring every google result that said to go to the hospital. She told me to make myself throw them up. I did my best. I was in horrific pain for days.

The next day she had taken me out to Olive Garden (and made it clear that the only reason she took me out was because she didn't want Caleb to hear. I think she didn't want Dad to either). At Olive Garden, she told me I had done it for attention. She told me I was a pattern. She told me that I wanted to be ill. She called me a liar.

I had tried to kill myself less than 24 hours earlier.

Months later when a summer camp counsellor told my parents what I had shared, my mother searched through my phone. She found evidence of me once again calling a girl ""mom"". It was a few weeks after that friendship had ended (that's another story, but it was 100% my fault and I was awful and needy, but of course I was heartbroken about it). My parents called me a liar for sharing my experience with the campers. My dad made fun of me for weeks. My mother said that I was diseased, and she felt like I had cancer. She banned me from talking to the friends I had once called my family. I wasn't allowed to close my door. I wasn't allowed to do the early college program I had been accepted to. I wasn't allowed to participate in the theatre program I was in and fell in love with.

They decided the only way to keep me quiet was to keep me locked away from anyone who might think they were wrong.

They took me to a psychiatrist, where I had a psych evaluation which I never got the results of. My mother refused to tell me anything but I think the original diagnosis was bipolar. I found books in her room about how to cope with a bipolar child shortly after. The psychiatrist got me a therapist who understood how I felt about my mother. I didn't tell her all of it but I explained so much. For the first time, an adult listened to me and told me it was disgusting. She told me that it was fucked up. I had never felt more validated. More safe. More loved.

As I gained new friends at school, I slowly diverged more information about my home situation. And the more I explained, the more people confirmed my suspicions of her awfulness. People believed me. People agreed with me.

When I was about to turn 16, my friends began to plan a party for me. Unable to keep a secret, I found out they were planning a surprise party. I excitedly told my mother, who quickly turned to jealous anger. She told me I was not allowed to have a Sweet 16 because she did not get to plan one. She had previously pretty much put it off the table. I didn't really have the option. She didn't care. She forbid a party with my friends.

Thankfully, my friends threw one anyway. It was amazing, and the best Secret Sweet 16 I could've asked for.

The day after though, I found out we were moving to \*state\* and it absolutely crushed me. No use writing about that here though.

When we moved, I spent a month alone in a hotel with my dad. Without my mother, it was the best month of my life in the home sense. My dad was happier, freer. I felt like I could be a little less uptight. A little less bound. It was amazing. When she got back, it wasn't long for the dust to settle. Soon she was back yelling at me. My dad would scream at me if I mentioned missing home, or not liking \*state\*. I learned to hide it quickly, and hide emotions far behind the self he saw. My mother forbade my dad from letting me go back to visit Michigan. Her anger became less like fire, and more like ropes in this home. She began trying to pull me instead of burn me. Instead of screaming at me, she began manipulating. She called me abusive, telling me over and over how I abused her. She'd tell me she never complained and had to bend to my brother and I's whims. She told me she felt like a slave.

A year later, I began pulling away from her. Finally in a healthy friendship and with plans for the future, I began to be able to finally plan my life away from home. I wonder if she felt her grasp failing. She tried a new tactic.

She came into my room and told me she didn't deserve me. She told me she was an awful mother and she didn't know how she got me for a daughter. She told me she was proud of me. All the things that should be coated in love.

But they weren't.

Her eyes were icy cold even welling with tears. I could see it in her half smiling lips how fake this was.

Just another grasp to keep me close.

She grabbed me and hugged me with the most abrasive touch and it was in that moment I finally had the moment I thought I'd never truly have,

*I will never love you*

I realized in that moment how much she had hurt me. How much she had broken me. How much pain she had caused. That it would never end. That I was just something for her to control. That fire quickly grew.

*I hate you*

avas1a,How do I help my friend (20 m) get out of his abusive relationship? 19f),"So my friend is in this relationship with a girl who hits him, cheats on him, tells him to kill himself, and keeps him trapped inside their one bedroom that they live in with like 5 animals. I saw him whehn she stayed with her dad for the night and he stayed at my place. 

She got home at like 8 a.m. and freaked out and called me like 30 times (he doesn’t have a phone, I’m pretty sure she doesn’t want him to have one) and I just ignored it and she said that because he wasn’t there, they were over and she was going to keep all his stuff. I decided to hold onto him for a bit and eventually brought him back to try to get his stuff and find him a place to stay at the moment. 

So when she realized he was with me, she blocked me on the only platform that he has that he can contact others, so he can’t talk to me and he hasn’t added me back. According to mutual friends, last time he was online was two days ago, like a day or two after I brought him back.

avbmps,Is this why I cut myself off emotionally?,"I was diagnosed with Aspergers when I was 16. When I was 13 my half brother in his 20s pushed me onto a bed and punched me 6 times as hard as he could all over my body. Had bruises all over my body, told my mum but she didn't do anything. Around that time he also forcibly held me and pushed his finger through my boxers into my rear so it went inside. When I was like 6-7 he'd lay behind me and rub my nipples until they were erect.                                      After the stuff when I was 13, I stopped brushing my teeth for a year and began just eating junk food, lost a tooth. Also stopped washing properly and my hair went completely black from dirt I guess. I looked up to him and thought he was cool, he moulded my interests and the films and music I liked. Does this explain why for the next 7 years I shut myself off socially, refusing to be involved in friendships and basically isolating myself from reality? I've rarely left the house or spoken to people since. Stopped going to school when I was 14. Also, i'm gay and had very little self esteem at the time it happened. I was so confused by everything and became disturbed and even more alienated. Does what my brother did explain why I alienated myself? Is it how an aspergers person would react? He would also push me over and drag me about the room and accuse me of faking autism. I remember visiting him once, cos he lives in a diff country and only ever visited us, and he pushed me about his flat. I hid in the bathroom, phoned my mum, but she never told him to stop. I gave up on friendships after this and completely shut myself off.",Randommyman,2019-02-27 01:33:02,0,317,15.75,36.42,92.52,16.71,15.85,14.2,89.27,61.2,23.03,19.56,13.88,0.32,0,5.05,0.32,3.47,3.79,12.93,7.89,8.83,11.36,0.63,19.24,4.1,1.89,3.15,3.15,0.95,2.52,0.95,1.58,0.63,0,0.63,11.99,1.26,0,1.26,5.05,9.46,1.89,2.21,0.95,1.26,2.21,1.26,3.15,0.63,0.95,1.58,3.79,1.89,0.95,0.63,0.63,5.05,1.26,0.32,1.89,0,1.58,9.78,4.42,0.32,18.61,2.84,8.2,7.57,0.32,0.95,1.26,0,0,0,0.32,0,0,0.32,0,0,11.04,5.05,3.15,0,0,1.26,0,0.32,0,1.26,0,0
avg0y6,What I Wish I Could Tell My Younger Self,"Everyone knows adulting can sometimes suck. As a teenager, I yearned for the day I could escape ""home"", live independently, have the life that I so desperately craved, and achieve my goals despite the chaos I had became adapted to.

I wasn't always filled with great determination, I found myself struggling more than my peers emotionally, and contemplating suicide at the early of age of just 12 years old. I attempted to do so in the next four years in various forms; self-harm, repeated overdoses, failed attempts to hang myself, trying to cut my throat, and obsessing over stepping in front of the trains that ran along 377. 

I was diagnosed with depression shortly before my 13th birthday, just three years after my sister had caught my mother's husband at the time, sexually molesting me on her 17th birthday. I was only 9 years old. I denied he was doing anything wrong, not wanting to ruin her birthday and full of fear after he had made threats before to keep quiet. My sister knew what she had witnessed, seeing the color drain from my face. It was within moments after her pleads to tell her what was going on, that I told her everything. The years it had gone on. The ""rewards"" of candy. The fear that I had that he would hurt my mom, my dad, and my sister. I was terrified, but I could finally breathe.

Speaking up to my mom wasn't an option in my mind. Her husband beat her regularly, and I spent countless times crouched in my bathroom sink with the door locked, trembling as I clutched our house phone set on 911, ready to push the dial button once I couldn't handle the screams and her pleading for him to stop, anymore. I would vomit at the sounds of his fists laying into her or using whatever object was nearby, her thrown against their bedroom walls, dragged by her hair, and her screams. Cops were always turned away as she always protected him. She had a short fuse as well, and took her anger out on me. It wasn't uncommon for her to be hitting me at an early age, digging her nails into the inside of my upper arms, using hangers on me while I was balled up on the floor, and nonstop verbal abuse. She filled with rage when I would wet the bed, (not taking into account as a sign of possible sexual abuse in children) would grab the back of my head and shove my face into my own urine soaked sheets as if I were a dog. I walked on eggshells daily, cleaned the house so she wouldn't be angry after coming home from a long day at work, making her bed, or folding her load of laundry she hadn't had a chance to get to. I tried anything to appease her - but it wasn't ever enough. I would get hit while cowering on the kitchen floor for not folding the towels the way she folded them, and other minute things. When my mother was told by my sister what her then-husband had been doing to me, I was called into the living room and called a liar. It wasn't until she confronted him and he confessed to her, that she then believed me.

Telling my Dad wasn't an option for me either. I have always been a daddy's girl and didn't want to hurt him. We spent every other weekend at the park, riding bike trails all over town, going to the movies, shown how to play numerous sports. He was there at every single soccer game I had. I couldn't confide in him what I could barely comprehend myself and the sexual assaults that were taking place.

My sister wasn't an option before that dreadful day. She also suffered the traumas I endured, battling depression, and spending most of her teenage years missing as a runaway, dabbling with drugs, or in rehab. She couldn't wait to get the hell away from my mom. She never left my side again after confiding in her.

My mom reported her husband to police, however, continued her relationship with this monster and allowed him to keep living at home. It wasn't until CPS became involved and began their investigation that she was told he either had to leave the home, or face consequences by the eyes of the law. He left to a nearby hotel, and she brought him a plate of homemade dinner every night. After I begged for her to divorce him, she replied that one day, I will ""understand what love is.""

He served only one year in prison followed by 10 years of probation. A sentence I felt was so minimal for the pain and YEARS of assaults I endured in silence, countless birthdays I wished he would stop as I blew out my candles, endless prayers begging God to make it all stop and save me, the childhood I was robbed of. I was angry, confused, furious. I didn't understand how God let this happen. How could the police, investigators and most of all the justice system, minimalize and fail me more than ever before? I didn't matter, I wasn't important. The tension grew between my mom and I after he was sent to prison, and the financial stability she had, dwindled. I spent the next few years trying to escape what I only knew as my own living Hell, letting my grades slip, becoming promiscuous, and seeking what I now know as a contorted form of validation and lack of self-esteem.

I wish I could go back in time to stand up for that little girl who was too afraid to scream. To tell her that I heard her cries for help. That she endured hardships that would one day help other survivors of abuse. That she didn't deserve any of this, and would grow up to be stronger than she ever imagined, becoming resilient, and having a family of her own that she always wished she had. I wish I could tell her to make the right choices because she deserved the best from life, and no one on this earth who hurt her was worth giving the power to dictate her own happiness in life. I wish I could tell her she was loved and worthy. But I am proud of the nurturing, compassionate, woman and mother I taught myself to become.",BigMommaLlama,2019-02-27 09:33:35,1,1091,53.29,44.54,48.1,1.6,20.2,15.12,91.48,56.28,20.62,16.32,9.07,0.18,0,6.78,0.27,4.31,5.59,14.57,8.07,2.84,6.32,2.11,17.23,5.04,3.12,1.47,1.19,1.47,6.14,1.56,4.58,1.1,1.56,1.1,13.11,2.02,0,6.51,2.38,12.01,1.92,1.19,2.84,1.83,1.56,3.21,1.83,0.37,0.82,0.64,2.84,0.82,1.1,0.37,0.37,8.25,1.92,1.28,4.03,1.01,1.19,8.34,3.76,1.01,16.13,2.29,6.6,7.42,1.28,0.92,1.37,0.92,0.55,0.09,0.37,0.27,0,0,0.09,0,14.12,4.77,6.23,0,0.09,0.09,0,0.37,0.55,1.83,0.18,0
avg1df,I literally have no will to live anymore.,"Ever since I was a teenager, my parents have done everything in their power to make me financially dependent on them because that allows them absolute control over me. So naturally, they never let me get a job. On my 18th birthday, my dad threw out a bunch of my stuff and said if I didn't go to college, he'd kick me out. I had no plans to attend college since my grades were shit, but I wanted to become a hair stylist or something. I never cared about being rich; I just wanted to do something I liked and be able to survive off of it, you know?

But I had no choice. My parents paid for all my community college fees and they hold it against me every day. But it's like, if they forced me to go, then obviously they'd be paying for it? Why would I pay for myself after being forced to go? Especially when they know I have no money to my name?

Anyway, once I started going to college, it was like a switch flipped. My parents started talking to me like they actually cared about me, but I'm an idiot for believing them for even a second. My personality is like... I can't hold a grudge. I move on from things quickly and that's part of the reason why my parents keep treating me like shit.

My major is psychology and I really want to become a psychiatrist. I know it's not cheap, nor is it a degree I'll earn quickly, but my parents aren't obligated to pay for my tuition at this point because it's my choice to continue with my education now.

One thing to note about my parents is that they both work in the medical field, focusing on physical health. My mom's an RN and my dad is a CLS. They don't think mental illness/mental health is real. Yes, they're ignorant Asian Indian parents. That's why they're so against me studying psychology. My dad's been trying to force me to become a CLS like him which pisses me off. He thinks everything is so easy as long as he's paying for it and that I have no right to complain. I want to ask him, who's going to be driving to school? Sitting in long lectures? Losing sleep because they have so much shit to study? Who has to maintain a good GPA? Does he think I'm going to put in all that effort for a major I DON'T WANT?

Anyway, my dad was saying how he wouldn't pay for my tuition if I kept going with psychology, and then he went off on a tangent about how I didn't have any plans in life. That really fucking got to me. It's not that I don't have plans in life... It's just that my plans are never satisfactory to my parents.

To make some money, I decided to get a job at McDonald's. Next thing I know, my dad took my car keys and said he would drop me off at school from now on and that I shouldn't work when I'm in school. (I will get my associates degree in psychology by December so I'm still attending community college.)

I was furious. I literally have ONE class each day, four days a week this semester. I HAVE SO MUCH FREE TIME. I just want to make some money so I can at least say I'm independent from my parents when I apply to universities later this year when I try to transfer, and he doesn't even want me to do that. He doesn't want me to have the slightest bit of independence. It's so frustrating how him and my mom think so highly of themselves and their own opinions... They literally know nothing about me, what kind of person I am, what my thoughts are, etc. Where are they getting their confidence from when they pretend like they know what's best for me? You can't know what's best for someone if you don't fucking know them.

And my mom just makes things worse by constantly running her mouth. When my dad is pissed at me for simply existing, she adds fuel to the fire. I literally can't remember a day since I started high school where I wasn't teetering between thoughts of killing my parents and killing myself. I went through periods where I self-harmed but I had stopped sophomore year of high school. But now that I'm at a stressful point in my life where I need to make sure I do well in school, get letters of recommendations together, and start making money, I literally can't stop thinking about killing myself. I can't escape these thoughts. I hate who I've become... It's like I'm a shell of myself. I don't talk to anyone anymore and it's like I'm slowly accepting this ""identity foreclosure,"" but at the same time, I know I can prevent my life from being ruined by my parents if I just end it all. This is how twisted I've become. I'd rather fucking kill myself than let my parents control the course of my life.

I really don't know what to do. I turn 20 in April and I'm so embarrassed to say I'm being controlled by my parents at this age when most people my age are already living on their own. Not that I think I have to be like them, but I just don't have any freedom. I really don't get it. I was never a troublesome child even though my grades were bad in high school (Cs and Ds, mostly), but my parents still haven't gone a day without abusing me. It switched from physical to emotional as I got older, though.

Ah, fuck. I'm so tired of this already.",kikingtana,2019-02-27 09:34:42,10,981,12.88,8.93,96.38,7.87,15.09,14.98,94.7,62.28,24.36,18.25,14.17,0,0.31,1.43,2.34,6.12,2.96,14.17,11.62,7.24,6.93,3.77,20.18,2.96,2.34,2.75,0.61,1.83,4.59,1.53,3.06,0.2,1.94,0.2,9.48,2.34,0,0.51,1.83,14.78,3.26,2.96,1.94,1.94,1.73,4.28,0.61,0,0.51,0.1,2.55,0.71,1.43,0.41,0,7.54,1.83,1.73,2.45,1.53,0.82,3.98,14.88,1.33,13.46,2.65,4.99,6.12,4.28,0.1,0,1.73,0,0.41,1.53,1.02,0,0.2,0.2,0.2,17.94,6.42,3.67,0,0.1,1.02,0,0.1,0.2,5.91,0.41,0.1

Since I have more free time in my hands, I wanted to let you all know that you’re not alone - whatever you have going on in your life, we can fix it. 

I’ll be more than happy to listen to your problems, your doubts, your fears, and quite possibly give you a few tips to make your situation better. I’m not a therapist, I don’t have doctorate in mental health issues, and I’m not a psychologist or psychiatrist, but I am a person who likes to listen and help people who need help. There’s no shame in asking for help whatsoever, so please don’t feel guilty or ashamed for reaching out to people offering help. You’re not weak, or a lost cause, or stupid; you just need help, and that’s something we all need from time to time. I will respect your privacy if you do wish to talk to me, or I can simply give you websites or phone numbers to call if you don’t wish to get too in depth with your situation. No questions asked. I will not do anything on your behalf, like call CPS or the domestic abuse hotline - I’m simply here to help and support you, you’ll have to make those important decisions on your own. 

I have PTSD, severe anxiety, and MDD and I’ve been sexually assaulted, emotionally and mentally abused, and molested ever since I was a toddler. I know and understand exactly how you feel - lost, tired, on the brink of toppling over, depressed, suicidal. But I also know that you can be brave and strong and get through all of this in time. It’s not going to be easy, but I hope I can help some of you to get where you want to be in life or at least comfort a few of you. 

Remember, you’re not weak for asking for help. I’m more than happy to talk about anything that’s bothering you, no matter how traumatic or heavy it might be. You have support and love all around you, please don’t give up. If you won’t give up, I won’t give up either.

avhrz4,Dont know wtf to do. Abused by family member with down syndrome. Family buried it. Do i sue,"I know this is the internet, please hear me out. 
25(F)
I have been diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety and Major depressive Disorder by several doctor's and I am medicated for it and seeking more help. I have struggled with it all my life and the more treatment I get, the more I seem to remember things I really don't want to. Most of my childhood is a blank with flashes of abuse. My mom was out of my life early on after my parents divorce but I reconnected with her recently and our relationship has been really healing. But my mom told me recently about how the family pushed her away after she put her foot down after she said we would no longer go to events that our older cousin was at. 
I didn't remember any of this so I asked her. Suddenly all of the flashes of memories made sense. How he locked us (my younger sister) in the treehouse and when he finally opened the door we were wiping our mouths and he was pulling his pants up. 
How we his under the bed from him and seeing his feet walk around the room looking for us. 
How we would never shower or always go in pairs because we were so afraid of him. 
My parents knew about the first two incidents, and then as kids we still ended up at every family event and forced to hug him infront of everyone. My aunt knew, he even attacked some kids at his school. 
So we just buried it. My aunt and uncle both knew what he did to us, but gave us shit when we wouldn't hug him infront of everyone. So we thought we just had to bury it and avoid him. 
It's effected my love life, my sleep, I freak out if someone touches my by suprise. 
I feel like I'm losing my mind. My boyfriend of 5years has been so supportive, and my sister and I are talking about it and we don't know what to do. It's effected us so deeply, but I don't want my life to be defined by a headline of ""girl sues down syndrome cousin"". He's so successful and I know it isn't his fault, my my uncle refused to get him help, my aunt made us feel so awful and my cousin's pushed us away because we were the cousins who wouldn't hug the mentally different child. 
What the fuck do I do moving forward.

avikmu,"Recently got texted again by my abusive ex partner, and I realised how much I have healed.","Idk if photos are allowed so i wont post them, but I got a new phone roughly a week ago and it seems to have unblocked his number (reblocked now of course). 
I got messages from him this weekend just past begging for a second chance to explain his actions. I finally got to tell him how I felt.
He was an awful abuser, emotionally, mentally and sexually. He took advantage of me at my rock bottom and gaslit me to hell and back. I saw from how he talked in his texts that he hadn't changed one bit, but I had the realisation that I HAD.
 My flashbacks and trauma are less frequent now, I even have a fiance who loves me dearly which i never thought could happen.
Im not healed of what happened, but Ive grown so much and I was so proud of myself for moving on, were as he is stuck in his awful ways.
I want this to be somewhat of a message to those who are in a similar situation, you are strong and you will heal and change for the better &lt;3.

avj1rt,Another is this abuse post,"Hi, 

Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I am 28F in England and have been seeing a therapist for depression and anxiety, and several things have come up in regards to my father that my therapist seems to think are really terrible and could be reported to the police. 

These things are:

* Asking me to download a pornographic background for his laptop. It was NOT child porn, it was a woman with 2 men if it matters. 

* Encouraging me to read erotica (things he’d written himself + books that he made sure I knew the location of).

* Him walking around the house naked and inviting me into my parents’ room to talk to him whilst he was naked. 

* Giving me a vibrator when I was 13.

* Offering me condoms and telling me to be safe. (Also 13 and with no interest in boys/dating).

All of these things occurred when I was between the ages of 12 and 15, but he never touched me or did anything physically to me. 

My questions are:

1. Is this abuse, or just a bit messed up?

2. If so, should I report it? I don’t think he has access to children/teens now so is there less of a moral obligation there?

3.  Would the police even care since no touching occurred?

4. If my therapist is overreacting, how do I go about addressing this?

Thanks.",Throwawayconfused90,2019-02-27 14:01:47,2,235,23.5,35.07,25.35,41.14,11.19,18.3,89.79,60.43,19.57,12.34,8.51,0,0,3.83,0,7.23,4.68,12.34,11.06,6.38,8.94,2.13,17.87,2.13,0.43,1.28,3.83,2.13,5.11,2.98,2.13,0.43,0.85,0.43,10.21,0.85,0,0.43,5.11,10.64,2.55,1.7,2.55,3.4,1.7,3.4,1.28,0.43,0,0.85,4.68,0.85,2.13,2.98,0,5.11,1.7,0,2.55,0.43,0.43,4.26,10.21,0,8.94,1.28,3.83,3.4,3.4,0.43,0.85,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.72,6.38,2.98,0.85,0,2.13,0,0,0,1.28,1.7,3.4
avk7c4,It's official. My brother is a Pedophile. (obviously tw for assault and CSA),"This isn't a new thing in my family.   


  
When I was a kid (maybe 10 or so), I found child porn on my dad's phone. I have reposes several memories, so I don't know if he ever touched me, but I do remember being terrified to be alone with him even before this. 

&amp;#x200B;

My brother, back when we were seven or so, used to put his penis in my mouth when he thought I was sleeping. He claimed it was a joke. He'd also expose himself to me and try to touch me. I'm reluctant to call this assault or molestation because he was also a kid, and may not have fully understood what was going on.   


I feel sick right now as I type this.   


A few months ago, my brother left for collage. He started sending me pictures of a anime girl who looked about nine or so and calling it his 'wifu.' when I pointed out how young she looked, he told me she was 'cannonly 21' which we all know is just a way to put kids in gross situations legally. He has me friended on steam, so I can see what he plays. He dowloaded two anime-style porn games, both of which feature underage-looking girls.   


Then, a few weeks ago, he told me a 'funny story' where he described having sex with a girl who was still in. high school. He's 19, but said the girl was a 'freshman, so I wouldn't know her."" if she was 16, he committed a sex crime.   


Then today, he sent me porn of a Pokemon character who's 11 years old in cannon. he framed it as a joke again, but what person saves a 'joke' that involves a child flashing her panties?   


I'm severely suicidal, autistic, and suffering from PTSD. I've cut myself all over the upper parts of my legs and stomach to try and keep from panicking too much. I don't know where to go from here. I've spent my whole fucking life trying to avoid anything that'd make me a predator. I'm so critical of myself I felt bad about having a crush on a 19 year old, even though I'm 20. Or another time when I was in collage, I told a friend of mine I thought another girl was cute, and he jokingly called me a pedophile because she had a flat chest. I wanted to kill myself over the idea. She turned out to be 21.   


I'm just horrified. I can't imagine someone seeing a little 12 year old being horribly abused by a grown man and not spending every minute of every day trying not to become a monster too. I have no urges to harm kids, and am disgusted at the idea, but I'm still so scared. and it's even worse now. My mom's a narcissist and my brother's the golden child. She thinks I'm insane, so coming forward now isn't an option.   


I'm just scared. He's popular and well-liked. there's no telling how many girls he could abuse. and there's not a fucking thing I can do to stop him.",wormathy,2019-02-27 15:47:17,5,539,14.43,43.36,61.94,1.36,13.48,13.91,90.54,58.07,20.96,16.33,10.02,0.37,0,5.94,0,4.64,6.31,9.09,10.39,8.35,9.28,2.23,18.92,4.45,0.74,3.15,2.23,2.41,6.49,1.67,4.82,1.3,1.48,0.37,14.1,1.3,0.19,2.78,5.57,11.32,3.15,1.11,0.93,2.97,1.3,3.53,2.23,1.11,0.37,0.74,2.78,1.11,0.37,1.48,0,5.94,1.67,0.74,2.6,0,0.93,6.49,9.83,0.93,12.99,1.86,5.19,6.49,0.56,1.11,0.19,0.37,0,0.37,0.56,0.37,0,0,0.19,0,20.96,7.05,4.64,0,0.37,0.19,0,0.56,0.19,6.86,0.74,0.37

avlc99,Was I abused as a child? I think I’m suffering from attachment trauma and I just want it to stop.,"I’m 20(F) and I just found out that my ex is a narcissist. My mind has been thinking about him nonstop. For months my mind has been on a loop from the moment I wake up. It starts off like this,” What is he doing?” “Who is he with?” etc until I go to sleep but the cycle starts again when I wake up with no breaks. I’ve blocked him,  deleted all of the conversations we had but I’m starting to think my obsessive thoughts have nothing to do with him and more of what happened in my childhood.
 
I have no idea what to describe me and my mom’s relationship. When I was younger when she was in a relationship with another woman that was in my life for the first 10 years. The earliest memory I have was playing with my dolls and feeling extremely uneasy around my mom’s girlfriend for some reason. She basically took care of me when I was younger. The worst memory I have is when I hid my grades from them because I didn’t want them to see my progress report. I made up some stupid lie and said that they didn’t come in yet. Of course they knew that wasn’t the case. So they picked me up from my grandma’s house and when I walked in she took my phone and told me that she knew that she was hiding my grades from her. All I remember was her getting in my face and I was hysterically crying. I just wanted to kill myself. My mom didn’t do anything. Then her girlfriend took clothes I had in a bag and dumped it on the ground and walked out of the room. My mom just came in and helped me pick some clothes up. The next morning my mom and her girlfriend were watching tv and I heard my mom’s girlfriend call me a bitch and say it again out loud so I could hear. My mom did not say or do anything.

Her girlfriend spit in my face, hit me with a baseball bat, choked me out once. Her girlfriend said she loved me and I believed it. Sometimes she would be really nice and other times she would do a complete 360. I remember her making all of these threats to me one day and I texted a friend about it. She read my messages and told me that she never said that.  My mom sometimes threatens to beat me or punch me in my face. 


I’ve been having the urge to move for months now, but I don’t know how because my mom doesn’t want me to leave the state. Honestly I’m scared of what she’s going to say. I’m really terrified of standing up for myself in this family.  I’m terrified of even standing up for myself to others.

avmcm6,Want to move out and be away from my family. Am completely clueless,"long backstory: 

My family isn't the greatest. Contact with mom is tough because of language barriers (I am from the Netherlands and I speak Dutch, she wasn't born here and she speaks it a little but she usually doesn't understand what I'm saying). Dad used to physically and verbally abuse me when I was a kid, always getting mad over the smallest mistakes I made. He doesn't do it physically anymore but he's still verbally abusive and manipulative. All he does is whine about how bad his life is and his moods are unpredictable. Both are neglective and generally are just more occupied with themselves and their own problems rather than taking care of me and my brother. 

Sank into depression a few years ago, dad told me I couldn't be depressed because ""I have it so good"" compared to him. I got treatment behind my parents' backs and am a lot better, but living with my family is still tough. Everyone is kind of living on their own, and I feel like I have to walk on eggshells all the time. It feels like my worries are rotting my brain.

A few days ago my brother screamed at me and threatened me because I was showering at the same time he came back from his job. He punched a hole in the glass of the shower I was in. If the glass were any sharper, I could have been severely injured. My dad defended him, doesn't care about whether or not I'm okay, and just pretended I didn't exist again.

My boyfriend told me this was a wake-up call and that I had to get out as soon as possible. He's right. I have to stop being patient with my family and just admit I do not want to put up with them anymore. 

more important stuff:

I am 20 years old and I dropped out of college. Everything just kind of sucks at the moment, and I want to turn it around. I have however zero experience in the ""real world"" because I was always occupied with my education. I am currently looking to get a proper job that pays enough to at least get me in a small living space and manage from there. 

I know that getting the living space is super tough. I have to admit, I am kind of scared. I have no clue what I'm doing because no one really ever told me about this stuff. Everything is super confusing to me, and I am afraid I will forget/miss something that could mess up my progress. If anyone could give me resources and general advice on how to get a place and how to live on your own, I would be very very grateful.

avnbjx,Advice,A bit ago I was assaulted by a group of guys. A couple of them have been harassing me on and off since and it's grown more into abuse. I have reported this and talked a bit to an investigator who was an impatient ass. So I said screw it and left it at that. My boyfriend still pushes me to go to the police and I understand why but it's never that easy. So I pretty much don't tell him what happens anymore. I wear makeup to cover bruises just cause I'm tired of it being a part of my life and his. So I guess I just cover it up and pretend most of it doesn't happen. Everyone I've personally talked to who's gone through with an investigation said nothing worked out and it was a waste of time and mental space.

avq1qx,It's been almost a year...,"It's been almost a year since I got out of my abusive relationship. I feel kind of crazy whenever I think about the fact that I'm glad that he almost killed me, because looking back that's the only way I think I would have been willing to leave. ""Willing to leave"" isn't even the right way to put it; I wasn't thinking about anything when I got away, I was just scared. So now it's been almost a year, and I've gotten a lot better in a lot of little ways. If I focus on progress instead of the end result I can see it; I still have nightmares, but I don't wake up choking from his hands around my neck in my dreams stealing my breath as I sleep via panic attack, I still flinch sometimes when people go to touch me, but it's markedly better than it was when I first got home, I can stay home alone now, even thought I'd usually rather not, I just started going to school, something I never thought I'd have the strength to do, there is definitely an abundance of evidence that I am getting better. But it's still hard to feel like I'm free sometimes; when life gets overwhelming and I can't breathe because I'm in my psychology class and my professor gives an example that hits a little too close to home, or when people ask me why I moved home and I just tell them, ""I broke up with my boyfriend,"" or when, in certain situations, it almost feels disingenuous to not share what happened but also you just can't find the words and you can't tell if it would be oversharing or appropriate but you feel like you aren't creating authentic connections because it's such a big part of you now and you hate that and you don't want to be too much. You know that if you're too much then people won't want to deal with you, because that's why your best friend since middle school bailed on being part of your support system when you got home, and you don't even blame her. It's a lot. You know.   


Sorry, this post has started to get away from me.   


What I wanted to say is that it's been almost a year and he still hasn't been sentenced. He's just been sitting in jail, with the court date being pushed back month by month, so I haven't been able to work on the trauma that happened the weekend he was arrested because it might still go to trial. I've already had to do a preliminary hearing, which was basically just a trial without a jury. I had to take the stand and was questioned by the DA and his attorney. His family was there. He was there. That was in November. At preliminary hearing, the judge approved all of the charges against him as valid for the prosecution to charge him with, basically that they had sufficient evidence to go forward with the case. He was charged with torture, kidnapping, false imprisonment, corporal injury on a spouse, criminal threats, and a handful of other charges that I honestly can't remember. I want this to be over. I want him either to take a plea deal or go to trial. I don't even care at this point. (That's not true, I'd rather he take a plea deal.) But either way, I just want it to be done so that I can work on the weekend that everything went down in therapy. I mean, I have plenty of other stuff to work on in therapy, he was abusive the entire year and a half that we were together, but not to the extent of what happened that weekend. I guess I just have this delusion that if I can work on that, that perhaps it will alleviate some of the constant underlying emotional discomfort that I feel. I want to feel anything other than deep fear, anxiety, and sadness, or just overwhelming relief. Those are my current highs and lows. I miss when my highs were positive emotions, rather than just reprieve from negative ones. I never thought that this would be easy, but it is so much harder than I could have ever known, and I have an extremely strong support system in my family and my boyfriend! I can't imagine what if would feel like to do this alone, that's why I'm planning on going into community outreach as a career path, possibly. I never knew what I wanted to do before, so at least this gave me a direction to go?   


I hope this is the right subreddit to post this in. I just wanted to type it out, it's helped my organize my thoughts a little.

The eldest wants out ASAP. How do I help all of the children?","My oldest sister \[31\] Barbara, has always been controlling. As she started having children, it has only gotten worse. Her oldest daughter is also our sister. Barbara took her in when she was very young because her dad abused her. (Her dad is technically my stepdad... who Mom is STILL married to because denial). As the only married and financially secure adult among us, Barbara was fit to take her in. Or so we thought. 

From what i've personally witnessed, Barbara barks at the kids (and her husband) for very little things. For a real example: If a child coughs, they are yelled at because she thinks they are choking.

My other sister \[29\], Katy, also noticed the behavior. But not wanting to be cut off from the kids (and assuming the calm husband was protecting them) we never pushed her and would just spoil and defend the kids where we could. But apparently it is worse than we thought.

The 17 Year old daughter (let’s call her Baby Sis) calls Katy and I in distress. She does not want to live with Barbara anymore. She has had enough of the constant yelling and put-downs. Asking her a question means she has an attitude problem and might even get her a “Shut up before I smack you.” Her every meal, snack, and drink is monitored by Barbara. Even staying in her room to read or text friends makes Barbara accuse Baby Sis of distancing herself from the family. I’m honestly shocked she lets her have a phone though it is of course monitored. 

Katy agreed she would take Baby Sis in whenever she wanted. However, we both thought it best she wait since she is soooo close to going to college and staying in the dorms. Until then, we could both take her on weekends to do activities (though Barbara might say no to most) and help get her involved in afterschool programs and the community center to keep her out of the house. 

We know Baby Sis leaving would make Barbara go ballistic and she would never let her see her siblings again. If she waited it out, there would be little to no drama. Baby Sis says she prefers not to wait as it is getting more terrible by the day. The longest she can wait is this summer, she says. At the same time, she also feels she must stay to protect her siblings. 

**Here are just SOME of the things Barbara has done that Baby Sis told us about or that Katy witnessed when Barb and family had to live with her in December 2018.**

* Smacked the 10 year old daughter across the face when she tried to tell her that another sibling was teasing the other. (this happened recently)
* The 3 year old is not allowed to drink much water even when she begs for it (so she doesn’t have to keep taking her to the bathroom, Barbara would say).
* When Baby Sis was 10 years old, there was a time when Barbara accused her of being a molester and tried to physically attack her. Barbara’s husband held her back. Note Baby Sis is the one that has survived molestation.
* Barbara still accuses her of being a molester on a frequent basis. (if she’s in the bathroom doing her hair at the same time as the other girls, she is up to no good!) 
* The 10 year old is occasionally accused of being a molester too. 
* Has not hit Baby Sis in years, but does occasionally threaten to smack her and has shoved her on the ground when she was very young, Baby Sis recalls.
* When the kids told their father that their mom scares them, he simply told Barbara. Barbara then told the children she would leave them all since “they don’t like her.” They cried and were afraid, leaving Baby Sis to comfort them. 
* The 3 year old backs up and trips over herself in terror when she “does something wrong” and begs Barbara not to hit her.
* Barbara has had two children hospitalized for malnutrition. The current child who is malnourished is at home now, but still on a feeding tube. Barbara and husband lied to the doctors and said the baby was not eating his food, when really they only give this almost 2 year old boy breast milk (Katy can confirm this all)

I’m absolutely devastated to hear just how bad it was. We thought she was mean and strict, not straight up abusive. Baby Sister is still giving us details of what goes on in the house, but as she tells us more Katy and I both agree that getting her out is more urgent than we thought. 

Barbara’s husband has told Katy that Barbara is like two different people and thinks she needs help. However, he won’t make her get it and is afraid to upset her.  Barb’s erratic behavior and high low moods makes me suspect untreated mental illness. Not enough to justify this all though, as she certainly puts on the happy family front on social media. And she can definitely be “sweet” with the kids when she wants. They never want for clothes and gadgets and entertainment. But when it comes down to it, they are treated like dirt. 

There are 4 children involved, ages ranging from 17 to 1, and Barbara is 6 months pregnant with the 5th. She hasn’t seen a doctor once, isn’t taking any prenatal vitamins, and is actively dieting.

We want to help our Baby Sis, and she should legally be old enough to decide where she wants to live. However, we also do not want to leave all of the kids in that terrible situation. Getting her out will likely escalate the issues for the other kids. We have no evidence of the abuse yet, but will tell Baby Sis to start secretly recording when Barbara yells at the kids (which is every day) send it to us and delete it immediately. Katy and her husband will take in all of the kids if needed. I cannot as I live in a 1 bedroom apartment, have no car, and don’t make enough money to support children. I do, however, want to help in whatever ways I can.

We know action must and will be taken ASAP, but want to do this carefully as this is our family. Reporting the abuse anonymously likely won't work, as there are details that only Katy and I would know. 

All and any advice is appreciated.

**TLDR; My sister is abusive to her 4 children, and has another on the way. She yells and puts them down daily, is controlling, has threatened and also physically struck the children. She also accuses the oldest child, who was molested, of being a molester herself. The oldest wants to escape the situation and has a safe place to stay, but then the other children will be left behind in the meantime. How do we get them all out and involve authorities thoughtfully?**",HotGoldenScones,2019-02-28 05:35:35,1,1219,36.56,93.53,6.82,6.03,16.47,17.06,90.81,55.37,15.5,11.57,1.48,1.97,0.08,6.81,1.23,3.94,5.74,11.48,10.42,5.99,8.86,2.21,20.26,3.94,2.46,2.13,1.89,1.97,5.33,1.72,3.53,0.66,1.31,0.33,20.51,5,0.08,8.7,1.23,11.73,1.89,1.48,2.71,1.8,1.56,3.69,1.23,0.16,0.9,0.08,2.38,0.25,1.31,0.16,0.9,10.01,4.35,0.49,3.28,1.48,1.23,3.36,12.96,1.39,14.52,1.97,6.15,6.81,0.9,0.98,1.07,0.16,0,0,1.56,0,0.33,0.16,0,0,17.06,6.07,4.1,0.08,0.08,0.16,0.08,0.08,0.66,1.39,1.64,2.71

avwmlf,I believed for years that I'd consented to my abuse.,"When I was a kid, I couldn't wait to grow up. I hated having to abide by rules set down my adults and I craved the freedom that came with whatever arbitrary coming-of-age number you subscribe to. Whether it's 17 for getting a car, 18 to drink, or 21 to graduate uni and be your own person. Whatever.

I hit middle school in 2004, when teachers were finally realising they needed to be tech-savvy. Monitors were still about a foot thick, XP was our operating system and MSN messenger was the favoured way of flirting with your crush. We had numerous IT lessons about staying safe online, the dangers of chatrooms and keeping passwords hidden.

I'd always been a bit lonely, I guess. I fitted in just enough to not get noticed. I had friends, but they did think I was a bit odd. I was smart, and a good kid, from a good family. The idea of getting in trouble at school brought me out in a cold sweat.

At 9 I was the weird kid who didn't quite have the social skills to keep up with her peers. I was regularly kicked the crap out of at school for being different. I developed early, and both boys and girls mocked me for wearing bras. I combated this with an adult aloofness, an arrogance, which, ironically, got me kicked down a whole lot more than if I had just conformed. I retreated to the library and lost myself in the countless pages of a hundred books.

By the time I hit 10 I was reasonably good with our computer. My parents left the house early to work. I had the house to myself for about an hour and a half. I did what any 10-year-old in the mid-noughties would do - I broke out The Sims 2 and created my own little world where I was in charge.

I craved control in a world where rules dominated; uniform, food, bedtime, clothes, computer time - you name it, there was a rule.

As an adult now, I can completely appreciate why these existed, but then? I wanted to rebel.

Like every kid, the second you're told ""don't do that, it's dangerous"", you want to do it - right? I was too scared to get myself involved in anything that would actually cause trouble, so I chose possibly the easiest way to get my fix of pre-teen rebellion.

I found chatrooms.

Un-moderated and with complete anonymity, I wanted to make some friends. It started innocently, but the number of people on there using it to do indecent things... I'll be honest, I was fascinated. it felt like I'd finally been allowed access to this secret grown-up world, and I loved how I was treated. The people I met seemed to genuinely care what I thought. It was like a shot of heroin to a child with absolutely no self-esteem or real friendship group.

The descent into the world of paedophiles was surprisingly swift. I learnt how to make people happy. I learnt how to hook up the webcam, take grainy pictures of myself, send them and erase them from the hard-drive.

I knew I'd get in trouble for what I was doing, but I honestly didn't care, because I felt wanted. We had lessons at school about paedophiles, but the images we were given were of creepy old men - clearly nothing like the smooth, sophisticated people talking to me, who cared.

I was a child. I was manipulated.

And for a long time, I believed I consented.

It's entirely reasonable to believe there are photos and videos of me floating around somewhere. Between 10 and 11, I must have sent dozens, if not hundreds of pictures.

And then I met a guy online who lived near me. He was nice, charming, gentle, he cared about my childish worries and fears. He seemed to just get it, where the other adults in my life felt alien and dismissive. He felt like he could protect me against everything bothering me, everyone who hurt me at school.

He wanted to meet. Tiny alarm bells started going off in my head, but I ignored them.

I met him, and we went back to his to play board games. Nothing happened.

The next time we met, a few weeks later, he kissed me, and he touched me. I never once said no. I believed, at the time, I was capable of consent. The first time we had sex, it didn't feel like how the teachers described rape and assault. It looked nothing like the abuse videos we'd seen about how you should never meet strangers.

The first few times it felt good. Maybe a little painful at first, but good.

After that, he got rougher. It hurt a lot, but I wanted to make him happy. He told me to call him daddy.

*Be daddy's whore*, he'd say. *Bend over, whore.*

*Yes daddy*, I'd reply. It made me feel so sick, so dirty. I hated every second.

He used my terror of getting in trouble against me. He'd threaten to tell my parents what a dirty little whore I'd been, that they'd hate me forever.

I believed them - until one day, something snapped. He used his threats. He said he'd tell everyone what I'd done.

I have no idea where this came from, but I responded with ""go on then.""

He never contacted me again.

For years and years, I didn't believe I'd been abused, manpulated and hurt. I believed I deserved how much it hurt because I'd consented.

Jesus Christ, I was 11 years old.

To this day I struggle with saying no sometimes. I'm a people-pleaser. I want to make people proud of me. I'm still terrified of getting in trouble.

Yes, I made some stupid decisions. Sending pictures of myself, meeting a stranger when all the trustworthy adults in my life had told me, repeatedly, that it was an incredibly dangerous thing to do? Really, seriously stupid, and I curse myself on a semi-regular basis for causing myself so much damage.

Ultimately, I didn't cause what happened to me. I was abused, I was raped. I was manipulated into doing things no child should ever be exposed to. For a long time, I had an incredibly unhealthy view of sex and relationships, and I have nightmares. The idea of being called *whore*, or saying *daddy* during sex makes my skin crawl.

I guess I've finally come to terms with the idea that it wasn't my fault.

I didn't consent because I didn't have the capacity. Consent isn't necessarily saying yes, or not saying no - consent means you understand, fully, the consequences of what is happening.

Legally and ethically, no child can consent to sex.

I am slowly learning to forgive myself.",RantyThrowaway110,2019-02-28 13:56:02,4,1157,42.98,34.21,81.42,5.01,12.44,16.51,91.62,55.49,19.97,15.13,11.06,0.78,0.69,1.99,0.61,4.75,5.88,12.71,9.33,4.75,5.62,2.33,19.97,3.28,1.38,2.51,1.9,1.64,7.69,2.85,4.84,0.78,1.73,0.61,11.32,0.61,0.26,0.17,2.51,13.66,3.54,2.77,1.56,1.99,1.9,3.03,3.2,0.95,0.61,1.64,2.33,0.61,0.61,0.86,0.17,9.08,2.51,0.86,3.03,1.56,1.38,10.29,5.88,0.52,12.27,1.47,5.79,5.27,1.99,0.78,0.26,0,0.17,0,0.78,0.43,0,0.35,0,0,21.18,8.04,7,0,0.09,0.26,0,1.64,0.35,2.94,0,0.86

aw7vcs,Abused by my parents,"I didn't really know how to sum up the title of this, because it would be endless. It's also really hard to put it in words. Crying expresses the pain in the best way. I'm not exaggerating, though.

My childhood was pretty much perfect. My parents loved me, cared for me. But when the puberty hit in, it all started to change. Important thing to mention - I wasn't an awful teenager. I've never arrived home late (without telling them), I've never been drunk, nor did I take drugs or steal something. They had literally nothing to complain about, but they *did* complain.

Both of my parents grew up in a toxic environment. My father's dad had died when he was just a little boy and my mom had suffered from a very harsh abuse from her own mother, so I know where all of this came from. My dad used to beat me for everything. I left a sock on the ground, he hit me. I forgot to close the door, he hit me. And when we had an argument, beating was his answer to everything. I could never express my own opinion, I was never allowed to speak up. Everything they said was sacred and when I tried to defend myself, I got beaten up. 

When my grandmother was still alive (most ironically - my mother's mom, the abusive one), she was the only one I could talk to. It sounds like a bullshit now, I know, but as she got older and wiser, she had realized her mistakes and felt very sorry for what she did to my mom. Their relationship got much better as the years passed by, but it was never completely fine. 

Now I'm 18 and I suffer from BPD and some other post-traumatic syndromes. When someone raises their hand towards me, I twitch. I don't trust people, I'm extremely anxious and I hate my parents. I really do. Although there were many good things about them, I could never forget that... puberty episode when they psychically destroyed me. I still live with my parents and they still abuse me. It's just psychical now, but it hurts even more. They deny everything, they blame me for everything, when I'm trying to make things work, they ignore me and even force me to apologize for the things they hurt me with. Soon, I'll be off to university in a different town. Sadly, finally escaping my parents is the main reason I want to go there. Not education. So... wish me luck in the entrance exams.

I just wanted to let you know that if you're going through something similar, you're not alone. There are thousands of kids all over the globe crying in their rooms right now because their parents aren't a good role models for them. Including me. Once again - you're not alone.

I didn't make up this story for a sake of being worshipped as a victim. It's as real as it could be. No living member of my family knows about my issues because they would never believe me.

Thank you for reading this.

aw9nly,My (27m) perspective of the relationship I had with the woman (24f) I love. The door will always be open...,"This is going to be a very long post, so please bear with me to the end. This is my account of what has happened and the way I interpret everything having to do with my relationship, or past relationship.


WARNING: Some descriptions and experiences below are explicit and NSFW. Proceed with caution. TLDR at the bottom.


Back in 2015 I met and immediately fell in love with a girl. She was a college student, and she would come to hangout and drink in the bar I worked at. We became close, and she eventually had to make a choice between me and another guy she was interested in, but had known for longer. The sparks flew when we first were dating, and everything seemed so perfect. Yes, it was love at first sight for me. Cheesy, but I know even now that it was true.


At the very beginning, we disclosed so many deep and personal aspects of ourselves. This was incredibly difficult for her, as she distrusts most people and has difficulty opening up to them. I, on the other hand, have always been an open book. Anyway, I confessed so many things about my life. That I had been battling depression since I was a teenager, and even attempted suicide after finding out that a former girlfriend was cheating on me. I also included at the start, though it was nerve-racking, my interests in fetishism. Being that I have almost no limitations whatsoever, and that my personal favorites include but are not limited to watersports, ABDL, and even scat, I felt that it was necessary to include before entering a relationship. Aside from that, I told her plenty of other important details. Like my father having passed away due to cancer earlier that year, past relationship issues and trauma, fears and phobias, etc. Nothing was off limits, and I made sure to let her know who I really was deep down. No secrets. 


Likewise, she confessed in her own way. She is a writer, an English major, and preferred to put her thoughts out on paper. So, she wrote me what felt like a novel, and I read and interpreted it. She went into detail about past trauma from abusive relationships, as well as having been cheated on, and cheating on someone. Going so far to admit that she could even cheat on me. She went on to elaborate, describing in detail her experience with a former significant other who sexually violated her. Which, later, would become an even more relevant topic for the two of us. Elaboration on her family issues, attempts at suicide, self-harm, experiences with toxicity, bisexual orientation, trust issues, genetic disorders, and more followed throughout the letter, and through conversation. Nothing she ever said pushed me away, or scared me. I was always confident that as long as she loved me, I would happily be by her side. 


The relationship she had with this other man became a problem for both of us. She couldn't decide at first who she wanted to be with. Her decision process took most of the summer, and was met with waves of emotions and passion from both parties crashing against her. One particular evening, after she had invited me over while he was visiting, I noticed a condom wrapper in the trash. I stormed out, nearly broke my hand hitting a tree, and went for a walk. Eventually, I came back, and we got into a heated discussion. After all, she had told me that she was thinking of telling him that she was done, and was going to choose me. I have a history of anger management issues, but I would never hurt someone I love...apparently only myself, when I hit inanimate objects. That afternoon, we came to a reasonable agreement, that we both loved each other, and that she would tell him. I apologized for the way I reacted, but also let her know how much it hurt to find that after having been told that I had her heart. After long late-night discussions, intimate evenings, and a heavily drawn out process of elimination, she told him, and she took hold of my heart. Relief washed over both of us, and the passion and emotion we had expressed behind closed lips could finally see daylight. Though, we never officially declared our relationship until Halloween of 2016. We wanted our anniversary to match with the night we first met.


Fast forward a little, and we had been together for approximately three months, officially. Early on, she told me she was unsure of whether or not she could involve herself in my kinks. Though, she understood the importance of them, she didn't share those interests. By this time, she expressed that she actually couldn't see herself partaking in any of them. Rather, it felt as though she had gotten my hopes up, and then decided to give up before ever trying. This impacted me very negatively, as sexual compatibility and fulfillment is also very crucial to a healthy relationship. For someone who is so involved in fetishism, it can be one of the most defining details. We discussed this for some time, but it always seemed to get worse. This caused a reaction from me, and led me to become passive aggressive and doubtful in the future of our relationship. Though, I loved her and never doubted that for a moment, I still had my own needs of which to be aware.


January 25th of 2017, I made a mistake that continues to haunt me to this day. Using an alternate Facebook account I set up for sharing with like-minded fetishists on a pleutonic level, I made a post. I stated that I had no interest in ""vanilla sex"", and that I wanted something more kinky in my life. Which, wasn't entirely true, as this girl I was with was literally the first person able to get me to achieve a climax. I always enjoyed the sex, regardless of whether it involved my kinks or not. Anyway, I went much further. I asked aloud to those I had befriended if anyone was like me and craved my fetishes as much as I did. Asking if any women wanted to do something with me that was far from ""vanilla"". When I did this, I never sought a response. All I ever wanted was validation that I could leave if I wanted to, and that I wasn't stuck. I didn't want to give my heart to someone for years, and be stuck in a position with children, marriage, or other such commitments, while not being satisfied. That would not be fair for either of us. No one ever replied, and I never followed up with any action. Even after the posting, I stayed with her because I wanted to work it out and be there with her always. My love was never brought into question. In time, we would eventually ease into my kinks, and some even became a semi-regular occurrence. Though, she never could commit to scat, and informed me even after attempting to take an enema for me that she wouldn't be able to do that for me. The rest seemed to be okay, but she never really enjoyed any of it. Understandably so, but at least she was willing to meet me halfway. I never ceased in my desires to further our experimentation, and would occasionally state that ""it would be nice if you would"" or ""if you ever surprised me with ____, it would make me so very happy"".


Unbeknownst to me, this became an internal struggle for her. She wasn't ever interested in my kinks. Though, she had a few of her own, she only ever admitted to a couple. Again, alluding to her distrusting nature, and inability to open up. As time went by, she would continue to react to my comments or mentions of kink with disgust and minor derogatory gestures. Often times, she required alcohol to free up her inhibitions, and allow herself to partake in my interests during sex. I recognized this as a potentially harmful means to handling it, but she insisted, and I wanted to support her decisions. Later, I will go further into the topic of her self-medication. We were relatively open about our sex life, and she expressed that she supported me and my interests. That she wanted to give me what she felt she could. However, later I would find out that she called me a ""weirdo"", and considered my kinks and personal interests to be gross. Followed up with plenty of other unfavorable descriptors.


Now, onto the self-medication aforementioned. Being a bartender in this small college town, she would very often come see me at work. We would drink together, and spent many nights and moments involving alcohol in each other's company. After she had chosen me over the other guy, she tried to maintain a friendship. He became inconsolably and erratically emotional. His friends, who were also her best friends, decided to take his side and defend him. They abandoned her, and she never forgave them. As it turned out, the guy was taking a mental disorder to try to earn her back and make her feel guilty. So, due to all of this and her pre-existing depression, she began to drink frequently. And in very copious amounts. I would often bring her home drunk, and put her to bed. Though, we also used the lack on inhibitions brought on by her inebriation to open up and experiment in bed. We agreed beforehand that this was consensual, and she preferred to be a little drunk before engaging in any of my kinks. As such, we would sometimes have sex while she was intoxicated. But, this became a serious problem. I recognized that it was feeding into her depression, and that she often would become relatively toxic and/or extremely emotionally unstable. As much as I tried to remedy the situation, it only got worse. To the point where she eventually dumped all of her depression on me, and expected me to handle it for her.


Time continued on, and our relationship with it. We were so incredibly happy with each other, and even moved in together. We adopted a tiny kitten I saved one fateful night. Everything became shared, and our love grew substantially. Though we, like any other couple, had our own issues of varying severity, we were an amazing pair. Sure, our issues obviously would become increasingly worse as time went on. However, I was always open and very direct, and thus I focused on handling situations as they arose. The above mentioned self-medication, depression, and toxicity didn't become a real issue until after we moved in together.


Never did my love for her waver, nor did my support. Through everything, I always was there and willing to help or pick her up when she fell. Though, I must admit, my own issues became a problem as well. Her depression seemed to fuel my own, and had an increasingly negative effect on my mind. My anger issues also became worse, as I would express my anger and frustrations in front of her. I would never react violently towards her, but I would snap at her and occasionally be rude. For which, I would immediately feel guilty and apologize, recognizing that I had done wrong. She was scared of anger, and couldn't handle it. So my anger became a point of conflict between us. Over the course of about a year of living together, we would develop other issues in addition. Nothing major, but little points of confliction that needed to be addressed. This fed into the summer of 2018.


She and I became part of a local group of friends. Most of them were my friends from years prior. We would join them for an annual vacation to a medieval festival and reenactment. Our first time visiting was the year before. This year, we went into it with a few unresolved problems. I couldn't get time off for both weeks, so I could only tag along for the second one. The girlfriend sprung on me the surprise news that she was no longer only going for one week, but instead for the full two. I was a little upset, but I got over it. The issues we faced mostly included distrust due to another friend of ours developing feelings for her, and she often would spend time with him (I suspect that she also had some for him). The other issue of grave importance involved a specific intimate night, which would lead to her blaming me of sexual abuse.


One night, she was incredibly drunk, and I was entirely sober. We had talked about having sex earlier in the evening before drinking. After getting her home, she reverted to what I called ""Hurricane"". The reason for this nickname was because whenever she would get this drunk, she would become belligerent, her emotions unleashed, her lack of inhibitions would shine through, she needed physical support to stay standing in many cases, her lack of balance and coordination would lead to breaking things and knocking them over, and plenty more. Anyway, it was a particularly ""stormy"" night, and I eventually got her into bed. My intentions were to simply put her to bed, but she had other plans. She asked if I wanted to have sex. Which, I admitted that I did, but I told her that it may be a bad idea. She insisted time and time again, and I continued to ask her if she was sure. I eventually caved, and we had very sloppy sex. We discussed me putting her in a diaper as well as her using it for me, but she wasn't sure. So, I put it next to us on the bed. We continued having sex, and when finished, we cuddled. Shortly after, she fell asleep. Normally, she would be sure to put underwear on beforehand. She explained long before that this was due to her fears of getting an infection, and due to her own personal comfort. I searched for her underwear in the immediate area, but they were nowhere to be found. Funny enough, I didn't ever pay attention to them after removing them whenever we had sex. Imagine that. Instead, I saw the pull-up on the bed next to us. So, I hesitantly put it on her to give her something, anything really. I was tired, and given the circumstances, I didn't think anything of it at the time. This choice of undergarment may have been a mistake in and of itself. So, after clothing her, I felt asleep with her in my arms.


Wake up the next day. She is immediately upset with me, and confronts me about the night before. She becomes increasingly hostile about the situation. Unfortunately, she had no recollection of the night prior, nor of any consent. I expressed to her my feelings and knowledge of the events. Hearing me through, she insists that I took advantage of her. That she didn't consent to sex. I went into extreme detail about everything that happened. She then also refers to the pull-up, and gets even more upset with me. I admit to her that I didn't think it through, but that it was available, and that I had her best interests in mind. I meant no harm, and didn't impose my kinks on her during sex. It was just a form of underwear that I selected given the circumstances. The rest of the time she continued to blame me, and said that I had sexually abused her. Perhaps it was a bad judgement call, and I should have just told her no. However, I never violated her, nor did I cross any lines in having intercourse that night. The only possible genuine mistake I made would have been the diaper. Even that, however, remained a possibility, but was only used for the purposes of providing her underwear. Nothing more.


To this day, she holds that against me. I know what happened that night, and I know that I didn't cross the line. I never violated, abused, or took advantage of her in any way. I'm willing to accept that it was a bad judgement call, but it's not what she makes it out to be. I believe this is something much deeper within her own mind. That regardless of me, this is an unresolved issue that I received the blame for. I would never, ever, do anything like that. Like the man who actually did violate her years ago. 


Back to the summer now. We had these unresolved issues, and they followed us to this event. I had worries, and with what had been going on between us, felt validated in my reaction. She became distant, and sought more space to do whatever she wished without my involvement. I had become a little clingy, and worried that she had other intentions. Given that this event had thousands of people, tons of alcohol, and plenty of open minded and free of taboo practices and ideologies, I was worried that someone might take advantage of her. That due to her frequent alcohol-abuse, she would lower her inhibitions and fall prey to someone else. As there are many people who partake in extremely liberal practices while there. I checked in with her everyday and expressed extreme interest. When I came to visit myself, she didn't behave like she had even missed me. I became emotional, and throughout the entire time we were there, we had intermittent issues. We met someone who became close to both of us, and we even confided in her the details of our recent relationship issues. The time came to pack up and we came back home. Shortly after arriving, the girlfriend prompted me with a proposition.


Earlier, she had prompted me with the idea of possibly opening up our relationship, or adding another person. I have always been strictly monogamous, and have been cheated on. Even though I knew I didn't want it, I considered the possibility. The proposition she gave me upon arriving back at home was to include this person we had become friends with. I expressed that I had no feelings about that other person, and that we hardly even knew them. That I still didn't feel comfortable doing anything with anyone else, or allowing her to do the same. Her insisted plan of including someone else kept raising flags in my mind. I prodded her for insight, checking to be sure that it wasn't a desire to attach herself to someone else. I couldn't handle the thought of her leaving me for anyone else. Especially not if that was someone I consented to sharing our sexual relationship with. Now, I don't even believe I would be able to ever do this. I'm willing to invest the trust, but I don't think I could handle seeing or imagining my significant other with anyone else.


It wasn't until September of 2018 that she even found out about my Facebook posts. Shortly after we came back from the medieval event, she found my posts on my computer while I was at work. I came home to her on the couch, and she looked very upset. She told me to sit down. For the next hour or better, she told me what she had found, and accused me of possibly cheating on her. I told her what had happened, and that it meant so little to me that I didn't even remember the posts themselves. That I never cheated on her, and that I only sought validation in myself. I must have apologized a hundred times. I broke her trust in me, and hurt her. Whether or not I did anything is irrelevant. We argued and emotionally responded to one another until we reached an agreement. She asked me what we should do. Though she suggested ending the relationship, I knew that I didn't want that to happen. We agreed that we would ride it out, and if things improved we would allow for that improvement. That we may eventually call it off and end it when the time came.


Over the next couple of months, everything felt like a mess. I had an conflict at work which resulted in my leave, and a start at the same workplace as the gf. We started becoming close again, even feeling a lot like we did way back before all of this shit happened. Yet, our problems remained unresolved. Our sex life last year went from little-to-none, to completely non-existent. However, in some ways, it felt like things were also improving slowly. We were looking to move, and had our eyes set on a few different cities. Our plan was to leave by the end of the summer of 2019, to allow us plenty of time to settle things and build up enough sustainability to be able to leave. Plus, it would allow us time to work on our relationship. This sounded like a great plan, but she had ulterior motives, and many secrets.


December became so much more than a month. In short time, it would become a defining moment in both our lives. She hinted at the idea that we could be leaving even before the end of the year. Which, turned into the possibility of just her leaving. I begged her not to go, and insisted that we could work things through. She humored me, but secretly she had already made up her mind. Early in the month, she disclosed to me her plans to visit her cousin in Denver. One of the cities we had been considering. The night she was supposed to leave, I caved on a feeling I had been having for weeks. I've never invaded someone's privacy like this before, but I opened her phone and read through her texts. What I found derailed everything, and broke my heart.


She had two contacts that she had been extensively talking to. One, a co-worker, and the other was simply named ""Orange Soda"". The discussions between her and ""Orange Soda"" seemed to be happening a lot, and they seemed to message each other fervently. I noticed that when we would be sitting together and watching a show or movie or something, she was always on her phone and seemed to be messaging someone. I asked, but never seriously pried for any information. It was semi-flirtatious, and it could have even been taken as a friendship alone. However, when I referred to the texts between her and the co-worker I realized it was so much more. They discussed the mystery boy, and the co-worker showed support for her to engage with him. Even more, she condoned being flirtatious in return, and suggested that she date and make-out with him. The gf responded telling her that she made plans to go home for the winter break with him. That they would go out on a date, and she would in fact make-out with him.


I was broken hearted, and couldn't contain myself. I took her luggage and dropped it at the bottom of the stairs in the snow. I threw her phone across the street at a building, and it broke. Then, I returned and shoved her precious teddy bear into her chest as she slept on the couch. The next half-hour to an hour was filled with us screaming at each other, crying, and so many emotions. She dressed in a slutty outfit and, I threw her out of the house. As she walked out into the cold night, I returned upstairs and slumped against the wall, fell to the floor, and cried uncontrollably. I eventually gathered myself enough to go driving for her fearing that she would walk into town without warm clothes. I didn't find her, so I came back. I found her back in the apartment. We talked, without yelling or screaming, and said we would not talk until she got back. The next several days, I was a disaster. I spent them either laying on the floor crying, laying in bed staring at the empty side crying, or sitting in a chair staring at a neuse and crying. I got really good at tying knots.


When she came back, she found me sitting in the chair in the dark. The neuse was gone however. I chose a neuse because it symbolized so much more. She can't even look at a neuse, as it is relates to trauma from her past, but that's why I picked that.  We sat down together, and we talked. I had written her a very long letter, and left her alone to read it. To summarize its contents, I told her how much I loved her, what I had done wrong, and that I was capable of being so much more. That I wanted to rectify my mistakes, and be a better man. I begged her not to leave me alone in the dark. After reading it she joined me in our bedroom. She told me that she had found an apartment, and she was leaving for Denver. And that I couldn't come with her yet. She wanted to take a break, but that we could come back to this relationship later. We also discussed what I had found in her phone, and she insisted that nothing had happened, and that she wouldn't have cheated on me. I didn't believe that last part. Since I had no other options, I agreed to the terms, and we started our break.


With no better options on the table before me, I moved back in with my mom, and have been working on myself since. For a period of time we stayed in contact. Admittedly, I texted her quite frequently, and was still a bit clingy. I've never done anything like this before, and given the context, it has been anything but easy. Since then, I've focused heavily on improving myself. Reading more, keeping a daily journal, writing a lot, working out (lost approximately 10 lbs. and a waist size), cutting back on soda, eating healthier, starting at a new full time job that pays really well, going to counseling, reconnecting with friends and family, minimizing my possessions, working on personal projects and trying things I've never done before, and much, much more.


This all sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Well, aside from my vast improvement, things haven't been so easy. Every single day is a struggle, and I'm still learning how to handle it.


We kept in touch, but we haven't been close. Sure, the beginning of January seemed tolerable, but it eventually fell apart. I was still clinging on, and she wanted space. I would react to some of her posts online or what she said or did unfavorably. For instance, I saw one of her posts she made about harming herself, and not having health insurance to visit the hospital to get help. She thought she might have given herself an infection in the process. I checked on her to be sure she was okay. Another example includes my passive aggressive reaction to her talking about someone who might have had a thing for her. It was childish of me, I know, and I apologized immediately after it happened. Lastly, I wish to cite one night in particular. She had an interview the following morning, but had put off taking a general online assessment for it. When she went to take it, her computer gave her troubles, and she freaked out. I tried to console and help her through it. Instead she became irrationally upset, and directed her emotions onto me by insulting me and treating me like I had done something wrong. I tried reasoning with her, but as she kept getting worse, I wished her luck and told her how awful she was treating me. She eventually got back to me and apologized for her behavior.


Shortly after she moved to Denver, one of our friends made the decision to move out there as well. And since he needed a place to stay, she volunteered. At first, this sounded like a great idea, and I was in favor. Yet, I would later find out that he is not actually gay, and that he began to develop a crush on her. Knowing our situation, and being one of the closest people to it...he violated my trust. I can't help but feel that he picked a side, when no one wanted him to. Honestly, it feels a lot like what her friends did to her when she chose me over the other guy.


Since sometime in January, we've had continued problems. She wants space, and I'm giving her that much. At first, I still would message her plenty, but she insisted I back off. So I did just that, but I didn't want to entirely. I started sending handwritten letters, as I felt that she might appreciate a weekly letter as opposed to an everyday text like I was doing. She seemed to be okay with the letter idea. And I've given her plenty of space, and refrained from sending her a single message in several weeks. But I still think about her every single night and day.


She was kind enough to call me on the 12th of February. It was the fourth anniversary of my father's passing. She knew it would be difficult for me. She also sent me a few messages about the gifts I sent her for Valentine's Day. I sent her an orchid plant, preserved rose, and another letter. The orchid was meant to replace the orchid I had given her a long time ago which unfortunately died. Too bad that when she opened the box, the flowers of this orchid were already wilted. I have no idea if she kept any of what I have her, or if she just tossed it away.


One very important note before I continue any further. Before she left, I gave her my father's wedding band to hold onto. It means a lot to me, and I swore on that ring that I would one day marry her. She told me she still wore it sometimes. I can only hope she wasn't lying.


Now, it has been a while since we last spoke. But I've had time to think, and time to assess. Thanks to my wonderful friends, family, counselor, physician, and others who have helped me through this. Whether it be advice or just someone to listen to me talk. However, thanks to them, I now know so much more than before. And I've come to realize quite a few things. Due to my own morbid curiosity, personal reflections, and skills as a detective, I've figured out plenty more on my own. 


I've realized that she is the one who has wronged me. That my feeling sorry and terrible for myself is not necessary. I take responsibility for my own actions, but I should never blame myself for the way she treated me. She always had her issues, sure, but this recent edition of her shows me that she needs to work on herself. That she is the one who needs therapy most of all. She owes it to herself. I don't know exactly what it was that made her so bitter and cruel, but this isn't okay. She abandoned her friends, family, and me when she left. All we ever wanted was to love her, and support her in life, and it seems she has turned her back on all of us.


So, I am faced with the hardest decision I've ever had to make. I know it's not fair, and I can't fully blame either one of us. But, I don't want her to hurt me like this anymore. I deserve so much better than this treatment. I'm done with the lying and infidelity. No more toxicity, abuse, or villainizing. I will not be her excuse anymore. It's time she grows up, takes responsibility, stops playing the victim, and becomes the best person she can be. I know that if she can do that, she will realize that I am right. At least, I hope she will, for the sake of my heart.


I will always love her with all of my heart and soul. I gave her my heart the day I met her. Unless someone else walks into my life and changes my mind, there it will remain. My hope is that someday soon, she will get better, realize what she did wrong, and forgive herself. Once she can free herself, then and only then will I be willing to return to her. I can't hold her heart any other way.


I am letting go. This isn't a goodbye...this is a see you later. When you're healthy and happy and have forgiven yourself. I love you, forever and always, my Jellybean...

awb9rl,Black Winter - This Post is Not For the Faint of Heart (18+),"6 year old boys never doubt their mommy's. Mother's nurture all children, but hold a special place in their heart for their little men-to-be. It's a natural process affection, in the same manner that daddys' are suckers for their little girls, their princesses, etc. so to is it the case with mothers.

It's not uncommon to hear a story in the media about men raping women, harassing female coworkers, or extorting women's sense of safety wholeness to gain advantages in the work place or in their own personal spectrums of life and work. 

Therefore, it would be blasphemous to ever consider that mommy's can ever conjure up a dastardly scheme to use their children for sexual exploitation. After all, it's always men who screw up, it's always men who rape, it's always men who take innocence from the young, **not women.**

***At least, that's I am told. I mean how could I ever conjure up the notion or conceive the clever idea, that my own mom wanted to fuck me?***

When I was 3 years old, my cousin's father flopped to the floor in their nearby 'mansion'. His heart was giving out, and soon my cousin and his brother would lose their only father they had known until that point. He was still in elementary school, and was mortified with losing his dad.

Some say he cried for weeks. Others say he silently contemplated what he felt. I say that pornography found him in his darkest moment and marked him for the rest of his life. With no dad to protect his eyes from evil, and with a grieving mother too complacent to want to even live anymore, my cousin became addicted and felt loved by the pretty naked girls on the screen.

When I was only 2 years old, George W. Bush was reading to a set of school children in Florida during the destruction of Twin Towers  by presumed Terrorists of the Middle East. Maybe he just wanted to get away from the hell fire he created to soothe his guilt, but only for a temporary period. 

My mother was almost like Mr. Bush in this manner; My brother died along the 4th month in her womb, and she only had a photograph of his dead carcass in a basket to remember him by. I would know by the age of 7 about his fate, when she showed the photo to me point blankly without second thought. She never thought twice about her decisions.

Maybe in this manner she thought that holding onto to her dead son's photograph would be a way to soothe the guilt that she failed to drag another hopeless soul into the world for her merriment. And when they both grow up, someone else would pick up the tab. This kind of mentality has plagued her until this very day. In fact, it was this brainwashing and devious tactic she was quipped with at an early age that lead her to bag and drag my dad.

First she spreads herself wide to lustful passion, inviting my father into her soul. Then she snags and drags him down to lower levels of self-fulfillment, threatening to kill him and drown him and even torture him to the depths of Hell and beyond if she never got her way. She never though twice about the consequences. But the Department of Family and Children Services sure did.

""Incapable to support her son."" ""Dangerous to her child and husband."" ""Lacks a sense of self and poses harm to those around her."" ""Cannot self identify with her own information."" ""Violently aggravated beyond normal levels."" ""Failure to comply with State Regulated Medication Prescriptions by court order.""

**""CHILD TO BE REMOVED FROM THE HOME UNTIL FURTHER REVIEW BY THE STATE AND HEAD OF DCF DEPARTMENT FULL-ON INVESTIGATION AND REVIEW.""**

***My father is a good man.*** 

**He's actually a rarity in this world, to the point where wives would want to leave their spouses to be with him. Not for his looks, or his smell, or even for humor; It's his self-destructive heart of gold that rarely exists in a man like him. In fact, he's always been one heart attack away from death. Ever since childhood.**

Dad found one of the State's top defense lawyers for hire in this case, advising him that his overall odds of winning were 10%. **He didn't care.** He went bankrupt, lost his possessions and a lot of money to fix Mom's mistakes. He said she was so happy to have me home. **For a month.** Then she stopped caring again.

Dad worked overnight into the day. If he slept at home, she screamed at him. Felt tired from working overnight, threw water bottles on him; ""You're a fucking loser. You stupid piece of Shit! Jesus Motherfucking Christ in the name of Satan UnHoly, BUY MY FUCKING SHIT AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!"" **""SHUT THE FUCK UP SON! YOU MADE THAT LITTLE SHIT CRY AGAIN! FUCKER!""**

**He snapped.**

Dad filed the divorce papers. Mom took me away, broke his landline, sold his possessions overnight. Threw away others on the streets and in garbage bins, even donating all the rest to Thrift stores. Pissed on his toilet seat and left diarrhea inside un-flushed. Trashed the floors, and ate all food. Finally, there was the note;

**""Call me if you want to see your son again. Good luck in court!""**

There was no phone to call anymore. He slumped on the floor, contemplating whether to end it all for good.

**He got in the car and called her father. Grandpa blew his gasket at her. The bitch cried.**

Court day came. Judge sided with my father. He offered full custody at first. **Dad couldn't accept it. ""Who will take care of my son while I work my way back?"" Mom smiled villainously. ""I live with a wonderful mother and father. My Dad works in a Nuclear Reactor Company, top engineer for 30 years. Mom can help me raise my little boy."" My dad wanted to chew her out. The judge actually did it for him.**

**""Just to make things clear; you're an incompetent woman. You have shown devious signs of a malicious content of character, possible infidelity masked under the guise of racial rape accusations, WHICH YOU DID DROP IMMEDIATELY MIGHT I ADD, and in turn, you shouldn't even have another right to hold your son. But on one condition will you keep him: You must comply with joint-custody and ensure that your mother, who seems to have her head on straight, will help you to properly take of your son.""** 

**2 YEARS LATER**

""911, What's your Emergency?""

""MY SON IS NOT LOOKING GOOD. HE'S EXTREMELY PALE AND EXHAUSTED. IT'S A HOT SUMMER DAY, I'M DISABLED. HELP ME!!!!!""

I was extremely dehydrated, nearly two days in a row from lack of care. Some say my mom was on the computer, playing with internet strangers while I cried out of thirst. **She says I just didn't want to drink.**

""Northern Territory Hospital, how can I help you?""

""Uh, hi. My son hit his nose in my mom's car while sledding a week ago, is it going to be alright or can a doctor help him?""

One surgery later...

**""I don't know how slow you could be as a mother, but your son will have to wait 14 years to get his nose fixed. He has the worst deviated septum we've seen on a child. How could you be so careless?""**



**Age 6 - Black Winter**

[Google.com](https://Google.com) \-&gt; Naked girls. Virginia. Virgina. vigina. Vagina. Boobies. Girl boobies. Vagina nd boobies. **girls fuck sex.**

**Porn found me at 6 years old.** Some consider that timeframe to be on an abusive level. Others downplay it, saying sexual interest and masturbation is normal. What about nearly 3500+ times by 14 years old, is that normal?

My cousin left the dirty links on my computer. I was beginning to feel excited down there. I felt happy when he came to visit me as I sneaked onto the sites when he left. **Mom was also excited.**

Mom knew a lot about sex for all the wrong reasons: Sexual fantasies, homoerotic fan fiction, Supernatural gay sex, incest sex, **50 year old man fucks and ejaculates onto daughter. She climaxed to his creampie and moaned, dada. Mother and son: Forbidden fruits meet forbidden love.**

My masturbation became worse: Leaning on chairs, leaning on chair frames, touching myself, looking dirtily at my mom, her letting me watch her undress, sleeping next to mom. 

""**Man, I want to fuck my mom."" - 8 year old misguided me.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Age 10-14 - Grey Fall**

Another cousin of mine was also into porn, **but he haunted me for life. It started with the war games. History was written by the victor, and he always wanted to win.**

**I was in his garage, tied to a chair by legs and hands. He grabbed his BB gun to threaten to shoot me. ""It's just a game, shut up!"" Then as he tried to shoot me, he fell to the ground, violently. He started twitching and spazzing out, foaming at the mouth.**

**Then, he settled down. But now he was growling and snarling at me, like a wild beast after their prey. This wasn't my cousin anymore, no; this was something else.**

**He grabs his father's hunting machete. He comes over and nibbles on my neck. ""I finally have you now, my pretty. I'm going to fucking kill you, like I always wanted to."" He swings., and misses. He stabs, yet stops before the skin. It's like he was fighting within himself to stop.**

He starts chanting gibberish to scare me, falls to the ground and twitches like in a seizure. He screams like a wolf, and bangs his head with a loud crack as he falls to the concrete flooring. I'm crying my eyes out.

""NO MORE GAMES! PLEASE! NO MORE!!!!!""

He didn't breathe for 30 seconds. His eyes stared blankly to the wall, his mouth agape. I cried out his name, begging for him to get up. 

**He got up, slowly. Hugged me, and untied me. Whispering in my ear kissing my head: ""No more games. Let's go inside and eat some cake, bud.""**

&amp;#x200B;

\- - - - - - - - - - - -

Mom always liked to play wrestle. She started doing so when I was an 8-year old. After all, **how else do you groom the ones you want to have sex with?**

**Being sexually confused, I enjoyed the teasing invitation. But one day, it all clicked.**

Mom was grinding on my crotch. Moaning and biting my neck. Kissing my neck and sucking my skin. She ran her hands up and down my body. She kept pulsing up and down, mimicking intercourse. 

""**I got you now sweetie, hmmm. Yes, you won't win now! Ha-ha, oh-yeah...""**

**Then she put me on top, missionary style, and wanted penetration. She reached for my waistline, and was ready for full sail.**

Then I stopped. ""I don't want to do this anymore.""

She told me to never tell my grandmother about this. **I never did, I just told the right people instead.**

&amp;#x200B;

**As I grew up, I came to know the Lord Jesus Christ, and I learned the truth about this deviant behavior. I struggle everyday to fight my pornography addiction, the spiritual attacks from her new-found psychic and spirit conjuring techniques, and even from flashbacks. I had a recent demonic vision where she sacrificed me to the devil while a male slave raped me, ate my head off, and took a shit on my decapitated body before sending me to Hell, in front of a dying and crying Jesus Christ on a cross. He died and turned to bronze when I was fully sacrificed in this vision.**

&amp;#x200B;

I want to die sometimes. But I look forward to overcoming this Hell, for the greater good of the Lord.

&amp;#x200B;

awcozf,"Altar Boy Abuse &amp; Cover-Up by Fr. Eduard Perrone &amp; David Schuster at Assumption Grotto Church Detroit, MI","David Schuster is a young man that knows about the pedophile priests. He grew up with a strange and intimate relationship with Fr. Eduard Perrone, long time &amp; current pastor of Assumption Grotto Church. He attended this parish and joined Perrone’s altar boys known as “Perrone’s boys”. During his childhood pre &amp; post-puberty, he was Fr. Perrone’s favorite and invited to drink with Perrone in the rectory every weekend. This continued and expanded as Joe Maher introduced more underage boys to Perrone &amp; Opus Bono Sacerdotii. He convinced them the rectory was a “safe space” to drink underage. I was one of these children that participated, yet was always asked to leave before the altar boys. David spent MANY nights at the rectory and would return in the early mornings hungover. His parents, Michael &amp; Carol Schuster, Joe Maher, and Fr. Perrone allowed this to happen and encouraged him to continue this behavior. 

David became the right hand man of Joe Maher and Fr. Perrone for Opus Bono Sacerdotii. He would be assigned to sex offender priests, bishops, and cardinals to be their personal assistant for anything durning their visits. He was rewarded handsomely with large paychecks every week and was knighted the youngest Knight of Columbus in history with his own chapter at Assumption Grotto Church with Perrone as Chaplin. David now runs Perrone’s altar boys and hosts an “all male”retreat where no mothers or women are allowed to stay the night, only the men &amp; priests.

I'm not sure if this was abuse or not but...

Some of my memories with my eldest brother were not pleasant to say the least.  There was an argument between us where I (in 3 or 4th grade) wound up pinned against the closet door while I'll screamed for my other brothers to call our dad. I wound up throwing his glasses across the room to escape. I can't remember if all of our arguments left one of us hurt or not but the arguments aren't the problem. 

One thing I remember clearly is him having me take off my pants and underwear and pee in bottles or tuberwear containers in front of him in the room. If no one was home, the bathroom tub or hover over the toilet.  He once put his fingers...down there...to inspect it. This happened often and I went with it. If I said I didn't want to,  he would say I couldn't leave until I did. If I still refused he would get frustrated and let me leave. Sometimes he would keep the tub of pee for days and not once did I question it. 

 My dad told me to tell him if anyone ever touched me there and I never did, even when cops asked me if he ever touched me after he was arrested for apparently messing with some neighbor girls and I still said nothing. 

He went to jail for three years and only recently did I start questioning whether or not I should speak up. All I can think of is how he took me places with my friends and bought me things and how me saying something now would cost him everything. Now he is out on bail, on house arrest and I'm homeschooled so I'm with him 24/7, not once did he mention what happened between us while we were alone and only asks if I know why he was arrested, which I do. I don't bring up what happened either but I can't get it out of my head.

But now I'm starting to think...did I just make everything up in my head? If say something, will anyone believe me? 

I just don't know what to do.",Throwway_2_day,2019-03-01 21:30:07,1,414,8.04,15.51,93.2,12.86,18,13.53,93.96,65.7,23.67,18.12,12.08,1.45,0.24,4.35,0,5.56,2.42,12.8,10.39,6.52,10.39,4.83,21.5,1.45,1.21,2.66,2.42,1.45,3.38,1.21,2.17,0,1.21,0.48,13.77,0.97,0.48,0.24,5.31,21.01,3.62,0.97,4.83,7.25,2.9,8.7,2.9,0,1.93,0.97,1.69,1.21,0.48,0,0,6.28,2.42,0.24,2.17,0.97,0.48,6.76,12.32,0.48,14.73,1.69,6.76,5.8,0.24,0.24,1.93,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.49,7.49,1.69,0,0,0.72,0,0,0,3.86,0.48,0.24
awekfn,I’m not sure if I have PTSD,"TL;DR Might have PTSD and want to know what to ask my therapist when I get an appointment.

&amp;#x200B;

Trigger warning, emotional abuse and mild sexual abuse discussion. View with discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey y’all, not sure what to post. I’ve seen therapists regularly my whole life but never really thought about having PTSD until recently. I’m getting a new, more weekly therapist soon, so TBD on how that’ll go down, but any advice from you all on how to deal with issues and what to talk to your therapist about helps.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the mind rambling/getting things off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been having nightmares and flashbacks on and off, in rare occasions, for a few years now. They aren’t triggered by anything in particular, like a lot of stress or something related to it happening that day. They just…sort of happen randomly.

&amp;#x200B;

All my nightmares/flashbacks happened after high school. I’m in my mid 20s now, and have been living on my own and away from my mother. She’s the main source of my trauma. Lots of emotional abuse and gas lighting. Manipulation. Making me doubt myself because I have autism. Made me hate my dad (divorced) all my life and left many psychological scars that are healing and have been acknowledged, but still sting now and again.

&amp;#x200B;

I may be bipolar, and was diagnosed from a hospital stay (anxiety attack) but then undiagnosed by a psychologist who knew me better later in life. I am certainly manic if I am off my meds, which I know to take regularly and they help keep my mood, anxiety, and depression stable. I am dealing with life quite well all things considered, and have learned to cope, but I still keep getting nightmares and flashbacks to things I thought I had come to peace with.

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to forget my nightmares very quickly, so I never really remember to bring them up at my therapist appointments. And they don’t really bother me in my day to day life. But they are so horrific and so vivid and so strong that I wake up in a cold sweat and an awful feeling in my gut that takes a few hours to go away.

&amp;#x200B;

They are mostly due to fears of my mother (emotionally) hurting me. Berating me. Telling me I’m wrong or forcing me to do something that would trigger my anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

A recurring theme is my mother and step father (both white) having a child of their own, and me (my bio mother’s child, mixed race due to black bio dad) being left behind or feeling like an outsider.

&amp;#x200B;

It was always a fear I had even though my mother never had another child. I always knew I would hate that child. That I would be considered an adopted child when I was a biological one. That me being the mixed-race child of two white parents made me less legitimate somehow. Even though I had no problem with others being adopted. Had I actually been adopted by my mother and step-father, I doubt this would bother me as much. Hell, to this day, if I ever had kids, I would ONLY adopt or foster, never have my own bio kids.

&amp;#x200B;

But for some reason it still bothers me. I mainly feared the other child would be born a white-raced boy: the thing I always wished I would be. But instead I was born a mixed-race girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I am transitioning to be male, and have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. But there’s nothing I can do about my race, not that I’d want to even if I could. I just have these strange thoughts about being mixed with a mind that doesn’t match that identity. It just doesn’t seem to click for me.I very likely have racial dysphoria, as I was raised “culturally white” and had mostly white family and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I never questioned my race until I was bullied later in life for not fitting in with racial stereotypes. But despite the actual physical abuse I received from my black peers, I never have nightmares about that. Oddly enough, that never bothers me. I kind of resolved it mentally one day by standing up to my bullies, and just like that, the bullying stoped.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven’t had a chance to do that with my other traumas.

&amp;#x200B;

And so, I continue to have these nightmares about the horrible thoughts my mother put into my head about my father doing terrible things to me, about the terrible things my mom DID do to me, and every so often, sexual abuse. It’s rare, but there was a dream that things I am certain never happened to me happened very vividly, and even while unconscious and asleep, I could FEEL it. I woke up in a could sweat, shaken to my core. I felt sick to my stomach.

&amp;#x200B;

I rarely have sexual dreams. I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve had dreams with any sort of represented sexual idea, even if was just a kiss or a lustful thought. I never see or feel genitals, think about sex, or dream about another partner in a sexual manner. But the few others I have had have all been in my adult life, within the last \~5 years. I was reminded of this because I had one just today, and I was able to see and feel genital stimulation. I didn’t feel anything pleasurable or painful about it, just that it was happening and it was not something I minded but didn’t really want either. Just…meh.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know if my lack of sexual dreams come from some sort of dysphoria or repressed sexual trauma. I can’t think of anything that would count as an event to say “Yes, this happened to me,” but I feel like something did. I can’t explain why I was so oddly sexual as a child. Maybe it’s my autism. Maybe something did happen to me as a kid. But the way I acted as a kid was not normal and I feel like someone should have noticed it sooner. My sexual identity is a mess and I still don’t understand what to do with myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m pretty lost as to where to go from here. I thought I had come to peace with these things. I’ve gone through so much therapy and talked about my problems to so many professionals. I don’t know why I still feel so unresolved with these issues I’ve never really had.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice helps. I don’t even know what I could do with my therapist other than talk about how these events make me feel and what I’ve done to cope with them. I’m not sure there’s much else I CAN do.

awgl9b,Am I being gaslighted?,"So my husband and I fight  a fair amount, maybe every three or four days, sometimes more. For a long time he would call me names when we fought, usually saying I’m dumb or saying that I hadn’t said anything smart during the whole conversation. A few days ago, we got into a huge fight because he called me retarded in what he says was a joke, but I didn’t think it sounded like that. After a while I left the conversation and he said that I was on thin ice (because he hates when I walk away from him). I was very angry after being insulted for a couple hours and never calling him a single name or raising my voice. I went back and said that I know I could have handled my self better and maybe I should have brushed off what he said as a joke, but I was still mad about the way he had talked to me. I decided that I wasn’t going to apologize and so when he came back to talk to me, he said I should leave if I’m not going to change my mind about it. I said fine and decided I was going to go in the morning. But then I started crying and asked him to give me some time to myself, but he stayed and eventually convinced me that I should stay and I ended up apologizing to him. He promised that he wouldn’t insult me anymore because it wasn’t “working.” Jesus this isn’t actually relevant to my question but I guess it’s just been on my mind. 

So yesterday, we got into another fight. I don’t remember the details very clearly. I usually zone out after a few hours of arguing because I know that he will just follow me around if I try to disengage or take a break to collect myself. Anyways, I mentioned to him that he does this thing a lot where I will say something to him and he will go on a rant for a couple minutes about things that disagree with what I said, and then when I ask why he doesn’t like my idea he will be like “oh obviously I agree with you I was just bringing up some other points.” So I asked if when he’s gonna do that, he could just start by saying something like “yeah I agree” or “I get what you’re saying” and then talk about the things that disagree with me. He quickly made the conversation about how I always have an attitude like I’m better than him. I asked him what I could do differently and he said “just don’t act like you have moral high ground” I asked if he could clarify what things made it seem like I think that and he said that I just don’t understand social situations and that anybody who was capable of change would know what he was talking about. Also, during this conversation, multiple times, he would say stuff like “I’m just trying to think of a nicer word since I’m not allowed to call you dumb.” And I couldn’t get made at him because he technically didn’t break his promise. He would not go back to talking about the thing that I brought up for hours. I eventually got him to talk about it and he said that he had agreed with me in the first place and that my issue didn’t happen like I said it did. He’s said thing like this to me before, so I usually try to avoid arguing about the specifics of what happened in a conversation. I said that it didn’t seem like he agreed with me and he told me I was gaslighting him. He says this almost every time we argue. I believed him 100% for a long time I always promised to be better about it, but I’m really starting to doubt it. He always gets to be right about what happened in the end. I could be wrong, but I’m pretty sure in order to gaslight someone, you have to actually convince them. He tells me that I’m lying to him, but I know deep down that I don’t say thing that I don’t believe are true. Even if I’m wrong, I wouldn’t say anything to intentionally make him doubt himself. He says he feels crazy because of me but I always agree with him in the end and I come out of it confused. I admitted a long time ago that I just have a bad memory and whenever I say something he doesn’t think happened I say something like “okay maybe it happened like that” or “I guess we disagree so let’s talk about something else”. I don’t think I pressure him into believing my side. By the end of every argument I feel like my head is in a fog and I can barely make coherent sentences, which he will say makes him right about whatever stupid thing we started arguing about 5 hours ago. I just don’t know. Is it possible that I’m abusing him or is he trying to convince me that I am, when he is the one who is gaslighting? 

I’m sorry that turned into a rant and I don’t know if all of it makes sense. I’m happy to answer any questions to clear things up or give more info about this incident or the relationship in general. I just need some support and advice.",throwaway52729296,2019-03-02 02:44:46,4,926,8.74,44.42,74.47,12.8,23.15,12.74,97.19,65.44,28.73,19.87,11.88,0.76,0.54,6.59,0.11,8.86,4,12.53,9.83,7.13,8.1,2.7,22.57,3.67,2.7,2.48,0.76,2.16,6.16,2.59,3.56,0.54,2.05,0.22,16.63,0.11,0,0,6.7,17.71,3.78,2.16,2.38,5.72,1.94,4.43,3.67,0.11,3.13,0.32,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,5.29,1.62,1.08,1.19,1.08,0.65,7.45,11.88,1.51,13.82,2.27,5.08,6.8,0.11,0.22,0,0,0.22,0,1.19,0.32,0.11,0.54,0.11,0.11,13.07,4.1,2.48,0,0,0.22,0,0,1.73,4.21,0.22,0.11

awkpz1,My (mid 20s) boyfriend (mid 20s) living in an abusive home -- how can I love him well?,"**Crossposted from** r/relationships **at mod recommendation.**

Hey all, I see you guys give a lot of good advice and I'm a bit confused right now as to how to proceed with things so bear with me as I get my thoughts out in words. You can skip past the preamble if you don't want context.

I've been dating my boyfriend for 4 years next month. He is the most loving, incredible man I've ever met, and I know for a fact I want to marry him. We've talked about that sort of thing but he'd like to wait for school to be over before we address that issue, which is fair. In the meantime, he still buys me flowers regularly at 4 years, sends me wake up texts, loves me for who I am while also helping me become better. I'm mentioning all this just so you know what kind of man he is -- dedicated, loyal, loving, devoted. Absolutely perfect for me and endlessly supportive.

His family is abusive. I've known this from the start. His father does not know we are dating, though the rest of his family does, because he met me once in high school and instantly hated me because I am open about having clinical depression. To this day, though he's never seen me again, he still refers to me as ""that crazy girl."" I know for a fact this man is emotionally abusive, but I do not know if he has been physically abusive. The fact that my boyfriend will not talk about it is telling, though, as is the fact he's told me once that he would ""wait with the phone in case he had to dial 911"" while his parents would fight as he was growing up. So, based on my knowledge, his paternal relationship is pretty screwed up.

His sibling relationship is worse. His sister is physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive. She is demanding, entitled, manipulative, hateful... a textbook narcissist now that I've learned what that means from this sub. She is the mother of my boyfriend's nephew who is still in elementary school. She leans on my boyfriend constantly for childcare, to the point that she recently ""moved out"" of their parents house and didn't take the kid with her. But she'll never give up the child, because he's her property and it'd look bad if she did so. He's her key to Facebook likes, after all. I honestly think that's the extent of that relationship, and I've seen the child cry for for literal hours about what a miserable failure he is -- he was 8 years old at the time. It's a mess.

**On to the kicker.**

A few weeks ago, I tried to help my boyfriend set a simple boundary with his sister. Long story short, she got hugely aggressive about it, and ultimately used my boyfriend's mother (classic enabler) to undermine the entire process. Then, she showed up at the house and absolutely flipped. In her tirade, she kicked the family's new dog (she literally killed the last one by snapping its spine) and got up in my face to the point I was about ready to provoke assault just to get her in trouble with the cops. She was that violently threatening. But the killer is that she used my relationship with my boyfriend as a bludgeon to hurt him with. She threatened him with telling their abusive father about me, told him he was a pussy and a coward for not telling the dad himself, etc etc. I was livid. I still am. That she'd twist my love for my boyfriend into a tool to hurt him is abhorrent. But, in addition to that, she was also physically threatening and abusive in a way that I had known about previously but never experienced firsthand.

My boyfriend has a full-time job with benefits, a car, etc. And yet, he still lives at home. (I also live at home due to being a full time student at the moment) He is applying for high-level schooling and says to me that he will look for a way to move out by JUNE. LOOK for. Not actually move out. I am stricken by the level of abuse he is enduring and that it is so tolerable and normalized in his mind. But, simultaneously, I know I can't swoop in and save him like Superman. I can't force him to make choices. He is a chronic people pleaser, terrified of rocking the boat and getting himself into trouble. It's taken a long time for him to learn how to say ""no"" at all. He naturally, habitually, defensively falls into what [r/raisedbynarcissists](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists)calls ""grey rocking"" without ever having heard of the method. I'm afraid that the longer he stays there the less he's ever going to be able to extricate himself from his family's claws.

So my question is... How can I be effectively supportive during all this? I've decided to start by reading The Disease to Please by Harriet Braiker, as I see that being recommended a lot... at the very least I want to understand his struggle better. I've been reading a lot about narcissistic abuse and methods for coping with it as well as the thought process of the abusers. I have requested that he see a counselor once the insurance from his new job kicks in, as he's just transferred positions. I don't really know what to do besides these things though. My own friends tell me that I should just try to support him the best I can, but I don't know what that looks like when he's not actively moving towards a solution. I am a very goal-oriented problem-solving type person so it's hard to make sense of in my mind. So, what do you all recommend I do to support him through this? I want him to be out of there, though I know that won't ""end"" the situation. But it would help, right? Either way, I don't have solutions that he seems to want to urgently pursue, and that scares me a lot. I want him to be safe above everything else, and because I know he keeps his cards close to his chest in many instances (due to a lifetime of abuse) I cannot always trust that he is being forthright about his home life or its severity. I am afraid for him but I want to support him in his decisions and in his safety, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do so in an effective, loving manner, and in a way that doesn't impose my own desires (him getting the hell OUT) over what he wants to do.

Thanks for any advice I may receive. And thank you for reading.

awmp24,Abusive parents ruined my mental health,"Hello, 

This is the first time I bring this out.


I grew up the youngest kid, my mom and dad are nparents. They were always fighting and screaming so never had peace at home. 

When I was 4 years old, I was a very active and energetic kid, so sometimes when my dad gets angry, he hits me with a robe and I used to cry not because of the pain, but I was scared that the scars would last for every. I used to watch them when they fight, mom is crying, dad hitting her. Sometimes my older sister would take me away but sometimes she would cover her ears and cry loudly. 

When I was 5 years old, my brother hit me and I start crying, mom gets mad and called my dad. Dad comes and throws me on the floor, steps on my back and forced me to eat tree leaves, it was fall and I remember them yellow and dusty. After that, he takes me and throws me from the 2nd floor. He kept repeated this until I fainted and there was blood coming out of my mouth. He stopped and told my sister to get me showered, and then he took me to toy store.

6 years old, separated my siblings and I from my mom. He took us to a deserted house and we stayed there for a while. 

7-9 years old, he kept abusing me physically. My mom would always abuse me mentally and physically as well, she used to make fun of me in-front of my cousins just to make them laugh.

10-11 years old, my mom got cancer and she traveled for medicine. Dad is still aggressive with me. 

12 years old, dad is still aggressive, he took away my room keys so I had no privacy, when I take a shower and go to my room to get dressed, he would always open the door and give a quick look and say “sleep early and don’t stay up all night” I don’t know what does that mean but I always knew that he should’ve waited until I get fully dressed. He would tell my brother to hit me with a big rock if I misbehaved. 

13-16, my dad is way so much aggressive, I was completely depressed, tried to commit a suicide twice but failed. One time I told him that I wanted to go to a school trip, for not reason I don’t know why he got really mad, he hit me and threw a chair on me, I was begging him to stop, but he continued. 

17 years old, my mom and my siblings moved to another town, I stayed with my dad because I wanted to finish school and then move with my mom. He stopped abusing me, but I found out that he put a spying cam inside my room, and I think that spying camera was there for a very long time. Also, one time he wake me up for school half naked! Only t-shirt and not even wearing underwear. I HATED MY LIFE.

18-23: moved to live with my mom, she is narcissistic, and I have no emotions toward her, neither have for my dad. Now they are old, seemed to be very nice, supportive and kind. Always giving me money and encourage me to finish school, but I hate them. Both of them have chorionic diseases, they look so weak, old, and miserable especially my dad who has heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, mental illness. He had an open heat surgery and a stroke.

My sister tells me to forget everything and move on, but I can’t. I’m going to start a therapy soon. I’m really afraid that what they had done to me will be there in my mind until the day I die. I just want to forget everything, and enjoy my life.",r_9_6_os,2019-03-02 13:36:48,3,665,23.04,33.68,92.1,3.22,18.47,9.92,93.98,54.89,21.65,18.95,13.08,0.3,0,4.06,1.5,2.71,3.46,9.92,6.47,5.26,9.62,1.65,19.4,3.46,0.75,1.35,2.71,0.75,6.17,1.8,4.21,0.6,2.11,1.2,12.78,4.36,0,2.86,4.96,9.17,1.35,1.5,1.65,0.75,1.95,2.56,1.65,0.6,0.75,0.3,4.36,1.5,2.71,0.15,0.15,6.32,1.95,0.45,1.65,1.95,0.6,7.07,9.62,0.9,18.2,3.46,5.71,9.62,0.75,0.6,1.2,0.45,0,0.3,0.15,0,0,0,0.15,0,14.89,5.11,7.22,0.15,0,0,0.15,0.9,0.3,1.05,0,0

Trigger warning: sexual abuse

I am seeing a new therapist soon, on a more weekly basis, but have seen a therapist regularly for my whole life. However, I never really realized I might have ptsd until starting my new job, where I talk to people about their disabilities and ask about how they affect their life. This made me start questioning myself and now I’m wondering if some things might be related to past trauma I hadn’t thought about before.

I know I was emotionally and psychologically abused by my mother as a child. She manipulated me into hating my bio father. She gaslit me and made me doubt myself because I have autism. She antagonized me when I had anxiety attacks and generally made me feel like I was never good enough. I occasionally get nightmares about this sort of abuse and have learned to recognize and cope with it, though I will be working through it more with my new therapist once I get one.

What is starting to concern me is my sexuality. I have gender dysphoria, and have recently started testosterone. Being more my true self has let me explore my sexuality, and having a new partner who is very open to exploring has made me realize some possibly concerning things.

I never have sexual dreams. Never so much as a kiss or a partially naked person appears in my dreams in a sexual context.

I can count on one hand how many sexual dreams I have had in my life, and two where nightmares. The nightmares were complete fantasy, and I am certain something like that never happened, but it was so vivid and so painful, I could actually feel it in an unconscious state. I woke up feeling sick to my stomach.

These sorts of dreams are extremely rare, but the fact that I had them at all, and such a strong reaction to them makes me worried that it may be related to something traumatic more than just not being in control of my body,
and having others hurt me in a way where I couldn’t escape.

The other sexual dreams I have are so “meh” that, had they not been so rare, I wouldn’t notice them. I had a dream the other day where I was with another person receiving stimulation from them. I could see we were naked and could feel them touching me. It was vivid, and in the context of the dream, this was a person I was attracted to. I didn’t really want it, but I didn’t really hate it either. It was just...meh. Whatever. 

The dream later continued with the same person and another pursuing me romantically, and that was much more satisfying for me. Even dreams like that are rare, where someone desires my affection, and genuinely pursued me instead of I them. 

I question my sexual desires as well. I think I am some sort of demi/pansexual. Most of my attraction is purely emotional and romantic with a person who has a good character. I have body types I prefer, but it’s the personality that attracts me. I can have sex, and actively seek to please my partners. But as far as my own pleasure, I simply don’t enjoy sexually pleasuring myself outside of masturbation in private. It just isn’t the same. Even if I am totally in control of my pleasure with another person, it just doesn’t do it for me.

This is where things get messy for me. I’ve always been an oddly sexual child, before I understood what it meant. I gave “bedroom eyes” and tried to look “sexy”, not cute, in photos, even family photos. I remember posing for a Xmas photo for family and licking a candy cane in a sexual manner. My mother told me to just lick it normally. I didn’t understand what I had done until much later in life. I had to be about 15 at the time. I don’t know why I did it, I just know that I did.

I gave my half brother a very noticeable hickey, and sucked on his neck, and he did the same with me, although I didn’t have the marks to prove it. Our dad caught us, and told us not to play like that any more. I initiated it. His mark was so obvious his mom made a joke about it, and we as a family agreed to never speak of it again.

I didn’t grow up with my half brother, I didn’t live with or see him outside of weekend visits to my dad’s house, where he lived, so I didn’t grow up thinking of him as my brother the way others who grew up with siblings do. But I still knew it was wrong. And I kind of knew it was sexual, but we never kissed on the lips or did anything else. I just knew it felt good to suck on his neck, and it felt good when he sucked on mine. But it was me who initiated it. And that concerns me.

I have autism, so I’m always a little behind with the social norm of when people experience things, and I’m especially a late bloomer when it came to actually having sex. I was so afraid to loose my virginity I actually had an anxiety attack. Thankfully I was able to try again with the same person later and became very comfortable very quickly. But I have always been eager to please others, especially when it comes to sexual acts.

I like to give, not receive. And this has left me frustrated in the bedroom. I just keep waiting for it to start to feel as good as it does when I masturbate, and it never does. Maybe my partners just aren’t patient enough to get me there, maybe I just don’t like it that much. But pretty much everything, from penetration to external stimulation does nothing for me. I just don’t have any sensitivity.

I don’t know if it my gender dysphoria, my autism, an interesting form of asexualilty or demisexuality, or some sort ptsd that is shaping my feelings about sex and my sexuality. I’m so confused and lost I don’t know what to discuss with my therapist or how. This is the one thing I can’t fully explain about myself. I can’t think of an episode that would have triggered me to be like this. I don’t seem to have any triggers either. These things just sort of happen at random.

So with all that out on the table, what do you all think? How should I discuss this with my therapist? What can I expect going into a session to deal with this? Any similar thoughts you’ve had or experiences?

Any insight helps.

awrz3n,My ex accused me of molesting him,"My ex accused me of molesting  him.

Trigger warning: sexual abuse discussion

I don’t even know how to even approach this. I am in absolute horror that I would have ever made him feel this way, and I am doubting myself. I don’t know where this came from and it scares me to think that I made someone feel unsafe or assaulted.

He was never great with communication and we struggled throughout our relationship with having clear and open discussions. I tried everything, from texts to emails to letters to verbal to physical gentle touch to try and have a serious conversation with him. I could never get a true answer out of him. I made every effort to tell him I was always there to talk and if something bothered him to tell me right away.

Any time I would push the line I would ALWAYS ask “Are you SURE you’re okay with this? Are you POSITIVE you’re okay with this? If at any time you’re not, firmly tell me to stop.” He never would, and I would continue with what we were doing, wether it be something playful like tickling or something more intimate.

Well, as we were breaking up, he finally blew up and accused me of some things. He told me I wasn’t supportive of him when he was going through a rough emotional time, especially being off his meds. I had no idea he was even having issues, because he never said he was, and he never said he ran out of meds. Of course I would have helped him. Had I known. I know how awful it is to go through withdrawals and he knew I knew that. Yet he never said a word.

He accused me of making him buy things for me disguised as thinly veiled gifts for myself.

This is in reference to a specific event. We went to an adult toy shop together, and with both our funds, we bought adult toys to use together. I contributed $50 to the final bill, somewhere over $100, which included a few toys we were meant to use together, as a couple.

We agreed there, in the store, we would be okay buying this for the both of us and not just for one of us. He said he was on board and said he would enjoy using the items too.

Later on, he decided never to use them for himself or together as much as I tried to get him to explore it, since he agreed at the store to buy them to try them out. The one that was mainly geared towards me, I tried to get him to use on me, but he always tired out from trying to use it and so I used it for myself most of the time, since he didn’t want to use it with me.

Apparently he was not okay with this and accused me of making him buy this item for myself, even though I pitched in $50 towards the purchase of it. If he was truly not okay with spending his money on these things, then why not say no?

But what really stuck out was him saying I molested him every day after school.

This came out totally out of left field. We met in college and I would often be home when he came back from classes. I would give him hugs and kisses and tease him with tickles to cheer him up.

Part of this teasing, which I asked if I could do when we met, and reverified again every now and then, would be having permission to touch his lower areas. I would touch his front and back. Things like pats and gentle spanks, rubbing, and if he seemed to enjoy it, not telling me to stop or pushing me away and giving me a clear no, I would go further with the front. I knew going further with the back was a big no-no, but he enjoyed when I initiated stimulation from the front and this would lead to him finishing this act with me in the bedroom or in the space (living room, usually) we started in, him pulling me closer and engaging in the act. If he ever said “I’m tired,” or “not right now,” or ever seemed uncomfortable and showing body language that clearly indicated he was NOT enjoying it or wanted me to stop, I would stop. Hard stop. If I wasn’t sure, I’d ask if I could keep going. If I was given the okay, I would continue. If not, hard stop.

My ex was truly molested when he was a child and told me about it, so I always knew it be careful and mindful of triggering him, this staying away from his behind areas. He knew the difference between teasing and being forceful. He knew how to tell me know and when he wanted me to stop. So how did I still hurt him? How, through all of this, did I still not recognize his discomfort, if he truly felt he was being violated.

I feel like an absolute horrible person, and every interaction with my new partner I ask every time if I can touch her before I do anything at all. I’m so paranoid that I’ll somehow hurt her, even though she’s assured me every time it’s okay touch her without asking and if she doesn’t want me to touch her then, she’ll tell me to stop.

I don’t know what to say. What did I miss? What did I do wrong? What DIDN’T I do that I could or should have? I want any further actions to be totally clear in consent, so I can make sure nothing like this every happens again. Please, PLEASE give me any advice you can on the situation. Our breakup was nasty but I never expected this. I want to know how to be a better person, and try to anyone for any son I have committed.

awtf8g,How should someone deal with people making light of ptsd triggers?,"When i was little my mom was a psychopathic bitch (still is but im not with her) and once threw me in a dumpster, at night, and sat on the lid telling me she wouldnt let me out until i stopped crying. Another time she just pushed me into the little gated area and shut it, and went inside and a neighbor waking past let me out. This happened a few times, but i only remember it as once. I was too young and short and weak to be able to get out. This has become one of MANY EASILY IDENTIFIABLE ptsd triggers caused by my experiences with my mother.

The other day at work i was taking the trash out with a coworker, and he shoved me hard, pushed me into the gated area where we have the dumpsters there, and jokingly locked it behind him. At night. In the dark. I started panicking and then when he left i lost it and started crying and just knew i had to get out. I panicked, climbed on top of one of the dumpsters, hopped the fence and then just sat their crying until he came back. He just started laughing even when i tried to explain. My managers did nothing, my grandfather was there at the time to pick me up (he always came early to watch me so i wouldnt get kidnapped while taking out the trash at night, its the last thing i do.) and he just laughed at the whole thing as well

I have no support and every day is a constant struggle. I dont know how to make people understand how scary it is to be me. 
Things like this happen too often (my grandmother hates me and often acts like shes about to hit and then laughs when i panic and start crying and immediately sit/fall down because of my anxiety that comes with it)

awyvar,Does abuse stunt brain growth?,"I don't know if anyone else who has dealt with abuse in any form feels this, but I feel like I don't have the normal mind of an adult. Sexual Molestation started for me at 9, kept going until I was 18 and then I dealt with physical and sexual abuse until I was 24. Now I am 40 years old and it feels like I have the mind of a child. I don't put adult things on the walls like some of my friends do, pictures or paintings. I have stuffed animals everywhere, prefer childish things , I have pink hair and I feel like husband is sort of taking on the role of a parent sometimes. I don't know if that comes from not having a parental figure in my life or what is actually going on there. We have talked about it and he feels that where I didn't have any male figures in my life that taught me anything, he is the one who does it now. He has taught me how to cook, clean, etc. I felt like when I was young and dealing with sexual abuse, I felt more like I was being forced into being an adult long before I should have...Now I feel like where I didn't have an actual childhood, that time is now. Does that make sense to anyone? I plan on posting my story about the abuse I suffered with my ex-husband, I haven't gotten it finished yet as it is a long one.

awz6io,Was it wrong?,"I'm going to start this by saying I was vulnerable when I was younger. I still am considered vulnerable. I have a learning disability, depression and anxiety. I was also in the care system when I was younger. I'm not sure if this makes any difference and I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but here goes, this might get long. Also I'm in the UK.

When I turned 17 and was finally free of being in care and returned back to my parents we basically never got on. Every opportunity I had I would spend at a friend's or boyfriends to get out of my house. As a young adult I also drank. Like a lot. At one point I met a less than savoury character twice my age. Some of my friends hung at his house and it was something to do. 

As my relationship with my parents deteriorated my relationship with said character who we'll call CD was born. He bought me picked me up in his car, bought me cigarettes and booze and let me stay at his house. We eventually started a sexual relationship. At one point my parents told me not to come home in a fit of rage and I ended up living with CD. Over the course of about 6 months (I had basically no contact with my family during this time)  I smoked cigarettes and weed and drank alcohol every single day.

 Eventually he cheated on me with another girl the same age as I and I reconciled with  my parents and moved back in with them. At the time I seen nothing wrong with the relationship despite a few people trying to convince me it was wrong especially because he was twice my age. 

There was also an incident where I got kicked out of a party (i was pretty drunk) after we split up and I had no where to go so I asked If I could go to CD's as I didn't know where else to go. CD said that was fine and when I got there he came on to me and despite me not wanting to have sex with him I was too scared to say no In case he threw me out as I literally had no where else to go and it was pretty much a storm outside. He was also a pretty angry guy and could fly off into a rage over nothing. He once threatened a neighbour with a cross bow over soemthing really petty.

 I haven't seen him since but he still now years later tries to contact me every now and again which I ignore.
Now as an adult with a daughter I see so many things wrong with this situation but I'm not sure they really are wrong? I have nightmares about seeing him again from time to time and I avoid certain locations he's known to frequent. I feel disgusted with myself that anything get happened between us and I feel violated. I feel like he knew I was vulnerable and used it to his advantage and ""kept me sweet"" with alcohol etc. 

I'd like to hear other people's opinion on my situation as I don't know If he really did do anything wrong or if maybe it was my own fault for not seeing through it and being so easily led.",spongesandonions,2019-03-03 14:02:15,2,571,30.23,18.59,96.25,8.85,19.03,13.13,96.32,62.7,20.32,16.29,11.91,0.88,0,3.15,0.35,4.03,4.2,15.94,8.58,7.36,9.28,2.8,19.61,5.43,3.15,1.75,1.4,2.1,7.01,2.8,4.2,1.23,1.23,0.18,9.98,1.05,1.05,0.35,3.5,12.96,1.93,1.05,1.58,3.5,1.93,5.08,2.63,0.88,0.88,0.53,2.28,0,0.88,0.35,1.75,8.93,3.33,0.88,2.28,1.4,1.58,9.28,7.71,0.88,17.51,2.63,7.88,7.36,0.35,1.75,1.05,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.28,4.9,0.53,0,0,0.35,0,0,0.35,2.45,0.7,0
ax08zo,I think I was abused as a child and I need help.,"Skip this if you don’t wanna know my life 

I’m 15, live with my parents and sister, been going to therapy for almost a year bc of an anxiety disorder, eating disorder, depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts (I feel like it’s obvious).I have an IQ over average, that according to my therapist, is what makes me anxious. 

Now the thing is I’ve always been scared of people yelling at me. I literally do anything if you angrily yell at me, even if it’s someone like my dad I feel like I’m gonna get hurt and it triggers a lot of stuff and I just wanna cry and die. 
This would be “normal” (for a depressed teen like me) if my dad hadn’t told me that when I was maybe 2 years old and my sister was I newborn mom had to go back to work and we had a nanny. Let say J. I obviously don’t remember her, but my parents said she probably yelled at me very often, and that makes a lot of sense. I remember covering my ears every single time my parents fought bc J “thought me to”. I have a feeling that a lot more happened, but I can’t be sure and I could just be overthinking and making it up. After that we had another nanny that yelled a lot and was really bad. I remember her locking me and my sister on our bedrooms so she could do god know what. She left us alone a couple of times and made the six year old me take care of her five month old granddaughter. 

And I know this is real or not, because I’ve forgotten most of  my childhood memories, except for school and cringe stuff you never forget. Idk if it’s worth “treating it”. Like telling my therapist and she’s gonna want to focus on that and I just feel like it’s nothing.

ax0bek,My dad abused me for years and nobody cares,"Background: I live in a small town in Michigan and my dad is very respected. He knows cops and people in the court. This takes place when my dad was 50-54 years old and i was 9-13 years old. I'm overweight too.

&amp;#x200B;

This started when i was 9. My dad was heavy alcoholic. When i was 9 he started abusing me and put up with it because i loved him. He would drink once a week and that would lead to him attacking me verbally.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i'm 10 and the abuse got worse. He drank more and much heavier now. He tried to kill me in my sleep with a pillow.  The abuse changed from mental to a combo of mental and physical abuse. He made me walk in -13 degree weather with a 30 minute timer clipped to my coat so i walked to my mom's work and he called the cops. The cops sided with him and made me go back.

 

Then at 11 and 12 it got worse. He drank 1 pint of peppermint schnapps every night or two. Thank god my dad's close friend helped me by taking me away to her house sometimes.  He would sober up apologize and buy me stuff to make it seem better. When i was 11 i told my mom and she called CPS (Child Protective Services) but he cleaned up his act the days they came.  When i was 12 he punched me so hard my nose gushed blood because it ripped the skin open. Then, he made me clean up my own blood. I began getting mental therapy (I cant remember the name) because i wanted to kill myself and had serve depression.  I escaped him in early February 2018 by holding a knife to my throat at his house. ( I did that 3 times before he gave up of his relationship with me and every time he called the cops ) And i tried to run away from him. He called the cops.

ax2nvn,Does being made to feel like your emotions are stupid count as abuse?,"I'm using my old throwaway account for this because I don't want to associate it with my real one, I may not reply to comments for a while due to this. I didn't know where else to go with this, which is why I'm posting here.

So here it goes. I'm a minor and so I still live with my parents. When I try to open up to them, they just make me feel like an idiot. They act as if how I'm feeling is ridiculous, and they won't apologize even though I'm clearly hurt, but instead act like it's silly for me to be hurt at all.

For example, the other day I was talking with my family, and we somehow got on the topic of a wedding we went to a while back. I had to have been a middle schooler at the time of the wedding, maybe eighth grade. There was free alcohol, and all the adults were getting really drunk. I'm usually uncomfortable around drunk people due to how my family gets on Christmas, and I was already pretty tense. I don't like big crowds, or parties in general, and I don't like to dance. My parents, fairly drunk at that point, decided it would be a good idea to physically grab me by each of my arms and pull me out of my chair and onto the dance floor. Naturally, being a kid who was powerless in that situation, it was pretty traumatic. I remember I ended up going up to our hotel room and hiding under the desk afterwards. This incident really upset me, even to this day. Yet when it was brought up and I explained all this to my parents, they acted as if it were the most idiotic thing in the world to be upset over. I was told they were ""just trying to show me a good time"" which made me feel dumb for being upset about it in the first place.

I've come to realize my parents do this a lot. I'll tell them that something upsets me, and they'll brush it off or make it seem like I'm being ridiculous for feeling how I feel. I hate being at home between them and my sister (who will get angry at small things; overreact and take that anger out on me by either berating me, destroying my stuff, destroying things I gave to her, or even putting me in physical danger such as the time she threatened me with scissors or the multiple times she drove unsafely while I was in the car; then be mad that *I* don't apologize to *her* for whatever little thing made her mad, which may include breathing too loud, humming, or tapping my foot to work off nervous energy) who they don't usually do much about whenever she does shit to me. I don't like to open up to my family because I know that they'll judge me and make me think it's my fault for feeling like this.

I'm really wondering...does making your kid feel insane for their problems qualify as a form of abuse?",J0hnny3Te4rs,2019-03-03 19:59:20,2,537,27.26,26.33,94.39,1,23.35,13.78,96.09,63.13,22.91,15.64,11.36,0.56,0.37,1.12,2.23,7.26,4.47,16.01,10.61,6.89,7.82,1.68,20.3,4.1,2.42,2.79,0.56,1.68,8.01,2.05,5.77,1.49,3.17,0.37,9.87,1.86,0,1.3,0,13.22,3.35,2.61,0.93,4.28,0.74,3.35,2.61,0.19,0.19,2.23,2.05,0.74,0.74,0,0.74,9.5,3.17,0.93,3.54,1.3,0.93,5.21,10.99,1.68,14.53,2.23,7.45,5.03,0.74,2.05,0.93,0.37,0.19,0,0.74,0.74,0,0,0,0,16.01,4.47,4.66,0,0.37,0.37,0,0,0.37,4.66,0.37,0.74
ax2ovy,Advice on how to help my boyfriend?,"Hey wasn't sure how to get help with this topic, so I came here to hopefully get some abuse survivors opinions on how to best assist my boyfriend.

So basically, he was in a long term abusive relationship before we got together and was physically assaulted by his ex multiple times. One of those times was when he was helping her dry dishes and he dropped one accidentally. Long story short, she ended up beating him and this left a big impact on him.

Issue is, now whenever I do the dishes he completely shuts down. If he sees me doing them, or hears the kitchen sink running he shuts down and curls up in bed under a blanket. I don't know how to help him with this. 

I try to only wash dishes when he's not home, but it's hard because he only goes to school and I go to school and work. So I don't have much time alone in the house to do this.

Any advice? Anything's helpful, I just want to help him so bad. I love him so much and just don't want to see him in distress because of something I have to do. It really breaks my heart.

Quick Note: My boyfriend was abused by a woman; he is bisexual and we are in a gay relationship; not sure if this effects any advice just putting it out there

ax2tra,i think my best friend sexually assaulted me (trigger warning),"in july 2018 i (F15) spent the night at a friends(F15) house, at that time i considered her my best friend, and had for a long time. we went to a family barbecue/party earlier in the day, and then returned back to her house later. on the way back from the party in the car, she kept putting her hand on my thigh and moving it higher and higher up. i felt kind of uncomfortable, but i didn’t say anything bc we were in the car with her mom and brothers, and i didn’t want to make the whole night awkward. 

when we got back to her house we went up in her attic, which had a tv and sofa. she locked the door, which i didn’t really think anything of at the time. she suggested that we watch scary movies, and i just went along with it. she knew that i got super scared during horror movies, and so she sort of held me ? while we watched it bc i got super scared. 

writing this out makes me want to puke

ax3wev,Seven years of torture,"There is only one person who knows everything I went through from 1996 until 2003. My current husband. Some people have asked me and they might have heard a snippet of information but I have never came out and said everything I went through for fear of the unknown....Fear of being told that I should have known better, fear of being told it was my fault, fear of hearing that I was so stupid and dumb for staying, fear of hearing how dumb I was for what I did, etc. I think its time now to end that, my story might help another woman or man. This will be a long one, most of my stories are long ones..... Here we go....

First off, I dealt with ten years of child molestation at home and in dealing with this, the second I turned 18 I wanted to leave home. I didn't care how I got away or who I left with, I just wanted to get away. I was working at a factory when I turned 18 and one weekend when I got paid, I decided to go cruising town. For those that don't know what cruising is, you basically drive a certain circle in a town area real slow and that is about it. 

I met a guy who at the time I thought was just so awesome. He had the big nice truck and he had a steady job. He acted just as sweet as silk when we dated. We didn't date long because where I wanted to leave home so fast, the timeline was incredibly short. It went like this:

October 5, 1996, we met in a parking lot where everyone gathered to cruise town and talk.

October 28, 1996, we moved in together.

November 13, 1996, we got married.

Ladies or Gents, most of you I know will have more sense than I did back when I was 18. However, if you are trying to get away from an abusive home with your parents, don't take my route. I have regretted those decisions ever since I made them. Back to the story.....

Everything was great even after we got married in November. However, the day that his Mom found out we had ran off and gotten married she told me that I had better be happy with him because their family didn't get divorces. At that moment, I felt like I had made a mistake. Thing is, no matter what mistakes I made in this situation I would never go back home. I felt like home was just as bad if not worse than anything I could endure living around these people. Our marriage was never just the two of us trying to make a life for ourselves. His Mother's house was so close to our trailer, I could almost touch it if I opened the front window. His aunt lived so close I could see her eating breakfast in her kitchen sometimes. So you get the idea, I had this family on all sides of me. This family was the most controlling, mind warping bunch of idiots I have ever dealt with in my life.

Things stayed on a decently straight path until I found out I was pregnant in May of 97. Once I found out I was pregnant, he started changing and not for the better. Before he went to work one morning, he asked me if I could call around town and find some cheaper insurance for the truck. He felt like what we were paying was just too expensive. I agreed and did this, it took me about three hours of solid calling but I did find a cheaper place. When he came home from work, I walked up the hill to his Mom's house to eat supper. At this time, I didn't buy groceries for our own home. He felt like it was a waste of money to have food in our own home when I could just walk up the hill and get something from his Mom's. I will go into that more in a second.

While we were eating supper, he asked me about the truck insurance. I told him that well it took quite sometime but I had found a place and it would be about 80 bucks cheaper a month. I said, well you will have to take your Mom's name off your insurance and add myself, because we would get a married discount. Apparently, something in that sentence triggered him. After we eat, we walked back down to the trailer and while I was in the kitchen just sweeping the floor all Hell broke loose.

""Don't you ever talk to me that way in front of my Mom or Dad!""

""I didn't say anything. I just told you what you asked about, you wanted me to find cheaper insurance so I did it.""

""You embarrassed the Hell out of me, I am not taking Mom off my insurance. She pays my bills when I give her my check on payday. I am not doing it.""

He grabbed me by my arms and slammed me into the closet in the kitchen. Our cabinet doors had these round ornate doorknobs that stuck out on the front of the doors. That doorknob hurt so freaking bad, and I was stunned. I was also around 8 weeks pregnant at this time. I begged him not to throw me around because I was pregnant and I didn't want to hurt the baby. I still to this day don't understand what I said that triggered him. He just lost it. I had a bruise in the back of my head for weeks seemed like and a decent bump back there as well.

This was just one of the many times he would sling me around, he only got brave enough to slap me a couple of times. The sexual abuse was the worst for me and the biggest amount of abuse that I dealt with while living in this pure hell.

One of the 2 times that he slapped me, he claimed it was an accident and had gotten so mad he just couldn't help it. I did hit him back with a frying pan because I told him you might sling me around or throw me into a wall, but you will NEVER hit me in the face. I should have just kept my mouth shut, it didn't matter. Not only was he abusive, he was one of these people that liked to show off their property. So anytime we ever went out anywhere, I had to make sure that I was dressed to the 9's and face full of makeup. Hair had to be styled because if I left the house looking the least bit casual, he would call me a slob and wouldn't even walk next to me when we were out somewhere. 

When I went into labor, he wouldn't take me immediately to the hospital. Oh, No, no. He wanted to take a nap first while I was actually in active labor and THEN take me to the hospital. He slept for about thirty minutes and then I called the ER to  basically get a nurse to tell him that we needed to go NOW, not in a hour when he decided to wake up. The nurse on the phone yelled at him telling him to get me up there now or it could get really bad. I didn't have the baby the second he finally got me to the ER. However, the nurses in the delivery room told him that it was extremely dangerous to keep me at home without any supervision while I was in active labor. 

When we got to the hospital, I had forgotten my slippers in the car. I asked him to go and get them for me, but he wanted to wait until his Mom came in later that morning. My feet were freezing, oh my goodness they were so cold. Why did he not want to go to the car and get my slippers? He wanted to sit and watch TV and eat Life Savers. I told my Mom when she got there and she went and bought me thick socks to wear while I was in the hospital. It was January of 98 when our first child was born and I would soon learn just how controlling he could be and his family.

While I was in the hospital, the Dr came in and told us the general basic things that you hear when you have the first child. No sex for six weeks and on the inside I was ecstatic. When the Dr left, he told me, ""Yeah right like I am going to listen to what he says. I am sure you will be fine tonight, won't you?"" I was floored.

That night, I went to the bathroom and he knocked on the door. ""Are you ready?"" I was trying my best to stall him in any fashion possible. I figured someone would come in wanting to check on me, a nurse or something. ""No, I am trying to use the bathroom.""

He told me that it would be fine to do it in the bathroom. He just wanted a blowjob anyways. I was just disgusted. I had just went through 19 hours of labor, had his daughter and all I wanted was rest. Not to mention, to piss in a little bit of peace. I finally got up a little bit of nerve and told him, ""Just please leave me alone. I don't want to even think about anything like that right now. I have stitches and I am tired and sore. The last thing on my mind right now is making sure you feel good.""

He got mad and left me in the hospital to go home. I don't know what he did while he was there. I was also scared because I had never been in a hospital by myself. He did come back in a couple hours but he pestered me all night long and made stupid jokes about having sex in the hospital.

We hadn't been together very long but even this short time, I wanted nothing to do with him in a sexual manner. Wasn't the rape enough for him? I guess not. He constantly asked me about why our sex life isn't good anymore and why didn't I want to have sex anymore? I mean step back and think about it, you moron. You are forcing yourself on the one person that you are supposed to protect and care about, they want NOTHING to do with you. The first night that he forced himself on me, I want to believe that was when I got pregnant with our daughter. I can't remember the exact timeline back then, most of that time before she was born other than a few things was a blur. He also wouldn't hit me in the face because I think he didn't want his family seeing it, he would rather grab me and throw me into the wall or grab my arms and shake me. 

I tried one time to tell him No and it was even worse. It was so bad in fact, I thought that I had started my period I was bleeding so much. The rape was him holding me down as much as he could, because I fought like a tiger, however at this time I was on the skinny side and not very strong. I knew no matter how much I challenged him in our marriage, it would result in torture. That is why I would challenge him a little bit basically to see what my boundaries were, but I knew the line that couldn't be crossed. I really tried to turn things around, I would clean the whole house while he was at work and I couldn't fix supper because right after our daughter was born he still wasn't allowing groceries in the house. That didn't come until a while later. 

When we brought our daughter home, I figured it would be like a normal family. I would take care of her while he was at work and when he came home, he would pitch in. I was wrong. He told his family that I wasn't able to take care of her by myself. They stepped in and before I knew what was going on, was raising our daughter. I tried like Hell to get him to help me take her back home, he didn't care. He just wanted to see her in more of a visitation form. He would walk up the hill to his Mom's and see her for about a hour, and then come back to the trailer. We had a decent sized trailer, not a small one you pulled behind a car. We had plenty of room for her, it wasn't nothing to do with that. I feel like he either didn't want her seeing him whoop the snot out of me or have her hear what he was doing to me in the bedroom OR he was just lazy and didn't want the responsibility of taking care of another person. But I wanted her with me. I got fed up and went to his Mom's, packed all her clothes up and her baby bed, drug them back down the hill to the trailer.

It wasn't two hours, his sister came down there cursing at me and calling me cruel for taking my own child away from their mother. I told her, I wanted to raise her. It was my job, I had the kid and I wanted to take care of her. I was 20 at this time. They claimed that I was too incompetent to take care of a child, that I could barely take care of myself. I don't know how they came to this conclusion, I felt like I was doing a fine job. They didn't and the fight was over. They won the battle. He stood up for his family and so back up the hill went our daughter. This was heart wrenching, I felt like I had no back up or help at all. I knew that I would never get to raise my daughter the way that I wanted to raise her. She would go through their church, that I was against (not church in general at this time but just those people) and she would call my mother in law, Mom. And she did, and I felt helpless. I felt like there was nothing I could do, I wasn't speaking to my Mom. I had no friends, he seen to that. I wasn't working anywhere, he wouldn't allow it. He wouldn't even let me buy groceries for the house. I did figure out a way around that though. I would go to his Mom and complain about being hungry, she fussed at him a little bit and I started getting thirty dollars a week for food.

I also got chewed out for it, but at least I could eat something. I remember one day, I was so hungry and I just did NOT want to go to his Mom's to eat anything. I proceeded to eat half a bottle of Tum's fruit flavor. Needless to say, I was constipated for awhile.  I didn't want to go to his Mom's every single night to eat, I wanted to cook supper at our trailer. Even though, I was getting slapped around I tried to be normal. I tried my best to make that worthless excuse of a marriage something it never would be, normal.

I wasn't allowed to take my own daughter to her appointments by myself. His Mom ""HAD"" to go with us. Looking back on it now, I think they were afraid if I got away from them I would have ran away. I honestly didn't have the backbone to run anywhere. I was scared that no matter where I went, they would just find me and bring me back. So I dealt with this bunch for seven long years. His sister was one of those people that when she spoke, she wanted you to listen to her. She felt like because she had taken some nursing classes that she was basically a MD when she honestly was nothing but a receptionist who could give shots. I am not dogging anyone if they do this job, just her. I hated her then and I hate her now. 

In 2000, my husband's uncle passed away from cancer. When we came home from the funeral, he was depressed and forced himself on me yet again. So in March of that year, I came up pregnant. We did have normal sex,well I say that but there were times when we would go for about six months without it and when I say that, I mean sex that you ""WANT"" to have and not ""forced"" to have but it seemed like at the worst times is when he got the upper hand. He never wanted to just ask for sex, he wanted to take it. I had our second child in December and I was starting to see just how messed up my life actually was at the time. Our son was just like our daughter, raised by his parents. I just wanted my kids with me, everyone in my family that came around couldn't figure out why things were set up the way they were and asked questions. I said, well they just like it up there better. It didn't even seem like my own family cared enough to jump in, so why should I? I know differently now, but back then being under the control of an abusive husband and an even more controlling family on all sides of you........I was scared to even breathe sometimes.

There were times when my daughter would cry and want to go home with me, I would take her. She would stay a night and then cry to go back to her Meemaw. I fussed enough and told them she needed to call her something else. I didn't like her calling his mother Mom.  We settled on Meemaw. My son, picked this up as well. 

The night that my son came home by the way, it was about -10 degrees outside. One of the coldest winters we had in awhile at that time. We used kerosene heat in the trailer and had one of those big stoves sitting in the living room. It didn't work though because my lazy excuse of a husband wouldn't take five minutes to remove the line off the stove and clean it out. So we had 2 of those rectangle kerosene heaters and let me say one thing, I could see my breath all night long. My son stayed with their ""Meemaw"" of course, even if they were staying with us I wouldn't have had them down there in that cold trailer. I laid on the couch that night because there was no way we could take the heater in the back of the trailer, but I laid there that night in misery. I had just given birth 2 days ago and the cold along with the pain I was in, was just horrible. 

This was also not counting the fact that the night before I was supposed to leave the hospital, my husband decides he doesn't want to stay at the hospital and leaves me alone. All his family leaves, what few in my family are gone and there I am in this big hospital with no one at all in the world. I kept my son in the room with me, but I was so scared, I couldn't stop crying. One of my husband's friends from school came up with his wife to visit and he called my husband to come back up there. He told him, ""She is a mess up here. You need to get back up here now, no I don't care if you have to work in the morning. She needs you up here with her. Her eyes are almost swelled shut from crying and they have already came in the room and asked her if she wants nerve medicine to calm down."" He hung up with him and said that they would stay as long as they could, but both of them had to work as well. I didn't ask them to stay, it honestly wasn't their place but they did stay until about 1am.  He didn't want to stay up there even though the staff at the hospital offered him the bed next to me in the semi-private room, he said that he ""had"" to go home because he had to work in the morning and couldn't miss work. I was never so upset in all of my life when he left that night. 

How messed up is it that a person who abuses you, you still want them to be around you? I can't explain it, never been able to honestly. 

In 2001, the dark skies finally opened up and I met my first friend who is now my current husband. He started coming down a few nights during the week to watch movies or eat pizza, fun things that I wasn't used to doing at the time.  I will call my husband who at this time was just a friend, A.

A was friends with my husband because they went to school together. They weren't best friends in school because A always felt like my husband had some weird qualities about him but they were friends. I finally had someone else that might see what was going on at the time but my husband would never do anything to me infront of anyone else. I was also so afraid to tell anyone what was going on during these times for fear of something really bad happening. However, I figured I would act differently because maybe if he snapped in front of someone else then I would finally have help in getting away from my husband. A would sit and listen to anything I had to say, there was one time that he stayed the night with us. I would sit in the living room with A and we talked all night long. I honestly believe the night that I fell for A, was the very first night that we sat together talking all night. I felt safe around him, he was respectful and he actually cared about my feelings. I didn't tell him that night what I was going through with the abuse, but I did tell him about how controlling this family and my husband were at the time. He told me, you need to realize that you are being used and molded into the person ""THEY"" want you to be, not the person ""YOU"" should want to be. Those words stuck with me that night. The next morning when my husband left for work, A was asleep on the couch. My husband walked up to his Mom's and I was in the living room on the computer. This was when PC's and the Internet was starting to take off and I loved window shopping online. It wasn't ten minutes before my husband came back to the trailer and told me that A would have to leave right now. I said, he is asleep and I am not disturbing him. He looked at me and said, No my family said that it looks funny for him to be here without me here.

I didn't understand it. We were just friends, nothing had EVER happened. Hell, he hadn't been coming down that long. This was the only night that he stayed with us and the only reason he stayed was because by the time we got finished watching movies, it was really late. I just didn't feel safe with him travelling back home at such a late hour, not to mention I needed someone to talk to. He woke A up and told him, you have to go home and I don't think you should come down here anymore.

 I was floored. 

My husband had yet again gotten what he wanted, the only friend I had in the world out of my life. I immediately started crying. A said if that is how you feel, I will leave. I cried and screamed when he walked out the door, begging my husband not to do this that there wasn't anything going on but he said it just looked better if he wasn't down there when I was alone. That family wanted me to not have any type of friends, family or honestly any kind of life away from them.

After A left, my husband was starting to walk out the door for work and I said something to him that once I said it, I stuck to it. "" I will make you sorry for taking the only friend I had away from me. You will pay dearly for doing this to me."" He laughed at me and walked out the door. From here on out, I only talked to A online through Yahoo Messenger. I had to sneak and do it as well. We talked online for 2 years, sometimes I would get caught talking to him and get smacked around. I say smacked around, but what I guess I mean is slung or thrown around.  Honestly at this point, I feel like I was getting numb to it. I never got numb to the rape. The rape was more scarce and happened about twice a month maybe three times and every time that I got caught talking to A, he threatened me with it. It took 2 years for A to walk back into my life, but I will get to that in a bit.

It wasn't long after this happened that my husband got the bright idea that our sex life wasn't enough for him and he felt that we should start opening up to the idea of having other people come into the mix. I was NOT having this, I begged and pleaded with him because I knew this was not healthy. I do understand that in some marriages, this might be fine with people but it just wasn't right for me. He would not let up on the idea and starting posting on swinger's websites. I was just embarrassed with the idea of doing this because it just felt like not only was he using me, he wanted to set and watch someone else use me as well. We met a couple who was really nice, I liked the wife and we got along really well. Nothing ever happened, me and the other wife spoke about it and we felt that we had a really good friendship going and didn't want to screw that up. Well, her husband agreed but my husband had a fit. We had been at their house when this topic came up and when my husband heard that nothing would ever happen, he immediately wanted us to leave that night. We never went back to their house. He decided to change tactics in ""changing our sex lives.""

Instead of bringing in couples, he messaged A's cousin who was another school friend. He started talking to this guy, lets call him G. G and my husband talked about A like he was nothing but shit. It upset me and they knew it. G and my husband seemed to plot together and try to upset me as much as possible when the topic of A came up. They would set and tell me things like, "" You don't need to be around A, his family is dangerous. They are nothing but drug dealers and you will wind up getting shot and we only care about ""your safety."" I knew this was BS. I also knew that my time with my husband was coming to a close, but being controlled in this mess for almost seven years I was scared to death in how to go about walking away from him. It has always been strange to me how even though I knew how bad I was being treated, I was scared of just walking away from him. I have never understood that, I guess it is just being used to a certain situation and the idea of something different just scared me? I really can't explain it. 

A called me early one morning and asked if he could come and visit me. We had been talking online and finally told each other how we felt about one another. He was so scared because he felt where I was still married even though I was miserable, it wasn't right. He wasn't raised that way to be disrespectful to another couple's marriage. Anyways, I told him I would love to see him. At this time even though my husband had forbid him to come visit me, I was tired of it. I was starting to grow a backbone but oh how it was still a very small backbone. When he walked in the door that day, the last time that I had seen him had been almost 2 years. He was the best looking thing I had seen in ages, I missed those brown eyes so much. He had grown a beard, full beard and I was just swooning. I knew at this point, love had finally hit me and I wouldn't ever go back from feeling this way again. He didn't even say Hello, he just walked in, kissed me and I just melted in his arms. We talked about everything that had been going on, I told him finally about the rape and the abuse. He said that I needed to get away from everything and if I wanted to leave, all I had to do was say the word. FINALLY, I seen my way out. I loved A with all of my heart, and this was my way to get away from my husband for good. I knew that A would keep my husband away and not let him get inside my head. I just knew it. I told him, Yes I want to leave here. I can't stand it anymore. I got a few things packed up and I snuck up the hill. I told him to go out the road and turn around and pick me up where I could slip in the car and not be seen. I knew if his family seen me get in that car, they would immediately call my husband home and my plan to get away would be blown to bits.

I also knew that if my husband got home before I could get away, I would be lucky if I seen daylight again. I was scared, crying and shaking the whole time but I felt like I had done something wonderful finally. A took me to his place and at the time he was living with his Mom but moving into his own place. His room was semi-empty but there sat the computer where we would talk for hours on end. The speakers that during one conversation when he told me that he had them, I thought he was just joking and he sent me a picture of them. I still have that picture. I wanted those speakers so much, I was somewhat a computer/tech/electronics nerd. I still am. About the time that my husband would have gotten home, the phone rang at A's. I knew immediately who it was and I told A, ""I don't want to talk to him anymore.""

A: ""You need to at least tell him that it's over. I meant I don't care much for him but at least end the relationship if that is what you want to do. ""

Even though A wanted me there with him more than anything in the world, he knew that if I wanted for some reason to go  back he would let it. A wanted ME to be happy. He didn't want me to go back there, but he wanted me to make my own decisions for once in my life. I took the phone and just said, "" I am done, I am not coming back to you. Bye.""

My husband started stuttering and said, ""Please let me come and talk to you about this, what have I done that made you leave?""

I just said, ""Really? You want to know what you have done? You know exactly what you have done to me. I am through, 

this is finally over.""

He begged me to  at least have one last conversation and even though I knew better, I finally said Okay. Believe me, I have regretted saying yes to him that day for 16 years. I should have NEVER agreed to him coming over there that night but something told me, let him say his peace. I was so stupid and foolish.

When he got there, I walked to the driver side window and said, ""Okay, what do you want to say?""

He said, ""Let's go for a ride and talk. I don't want to talk here. I will bring you right back if you want to come back, if you don't then we can come back and tell him and then go home.""

I told him, "" I am not going back with you. There is NOTHING you can say to change my mind. NOTHING.""

Boy, was I wrong. He drove a couple of miles down the road and parked the car. He then proceeded to cry and beg for forgiveness. He said that I couldn't leave him because he would be lost without me. The kids would be lost without me. How can I leave the kids and him behind? I honestly started feeling bad for him. I don't know why, I still don't know why. But for some reason when he said that he would change, and that I couldn't leave the kids without a mother, something got me. It honestly makes me sick to type this out, I to this very day apologize to my husband for what happened that night. I let him get inside my head again even after I swore that I wouldn't do it. I honestly apologized to A the other night for me going back after I had finally left him. 

It took six months before I got up the courage to leave him. Six long, horrendous months. I was so scared because now he was even more controlling, watching every step I made, but there was one time he couldn't watch me. His family did, but I think at this time they knew I was done with their BS and didn't say much to him or me for that matter. He couldn't watch me when he was at work. A started coming back down there again, telling me that I was insane for coming back to the mess. I knew it but I was still so scared. I had realized that I was under so much control that I couldn't even make my own choices. I felt like there was nothing I could do but just stay in this Hell I had created for myself. I came back to it, I deserved to live in it. I got my husband to move us from under his Mom's nose to town because for one I just wanted to get off that hill and away from all of his family. I still loved A dearly, I honestly should have just stayed that night when I originally left with him. You have no idea how much I beat myself up for that throughout the years. A has never once made me feel bad over that night, he understands that I was under a control more powerful than I knew how to handle and he knew I would eventually walk away from the Hell forever.

I did too. June 1st 2003, I walked away for good. I got up that morning at 9am and did my normal morning routine. I went in the living room, turned the PC and the TV on and got my Pepsi for the morning. I will never forget what I was doing either. I was sitting there window shopping on CompUSA's website for PC parts (forever a geek) and it just hit me like a brick wall. I looked around the room at everything and realized I don't belong here. I looked over in the corner at the curio cabinet with my husband's Nascar collection that I wanted to burn slowly in a massive fire. His precious cars made me sick to my stomach. I said to myself, ""What am I doing here?"" I immediately went back to the bedroom and he was fixing to wake up and I was just standing over top of him like a statue. 

He focused on me and I just laid it all out in one sentence. 

""I don't love you, I haven't loved you in years and I am leaving.""

He stutters and wakes up, tells me to wait just a second as I leave the room to go call A to come get me. I make it to the phone and almost had the number dialed before he jerked the phone out of my hands. 

""Let's talk about this, I thought things were finally back to normal around here.""

I told him, ""Normal? Normal? You want to talk about normal. How normal was it the other night when A came up here to visit and you stripped my clothes off in front of him and asked him to have sex with me while you watched? Then once he said No, you tell me that he surely can't love me because if he did he would have done it right there? Then what proceeded after he left that night is far from normal. ""

After A left that night, because even after I came back to my husband at the time A would still come and visit me when he could visit me. My husband took it out on me because A didn't agree to what my husband asked of him. I knew that night, things would never be normal ever again. This was going to be my life if I never got away from him no matter how much I kissed his ass or challenged him. I sat there and listened to him go over basically the past seven years in about four hours. The reason it took so long for A to come and get me, he was at work when I finally got the phone back and called him. I called his house, got nothing so I called his work and told him I needed him to come and get me. He said he would be there right at 6pm. So the rest of the day I sat and listened while I packed my stuff up of course, how bad a mother I was being even though we didn't even have our kids with us and how bad a person I was in general. 

I was never so anxious for 6pm to get there in all my life. Literally the second the clock flipped over to 6pm, I heard A's car pull in the driveway. I heard him come up the stairs because at this time we were in the apartment now up town. He knocked on the door and there I stood, bags in hand and passing him everything I had packed up. He was grinning from ear to ear. The second I stepped across the threshold out of that apartment, my husband hollered, ""Please, don't leave me."" I slammed the door and I have NEVER looked back. 

Has this 16 years been just peaches and cream? No. Has this 16 years since I left my ex-husband been completely free of troubles? No. Has this 16 years been free of rape and abuse? YES! We have had some hard times, but never once have I ever wondered about him hitting me or cheating on me, and honestly I have NEVER wondered if he really loves me. I KNOW he does! I know one hundred million percent that he does, he knows that I would walk through Hell for him because I did walk through it for him. Yes, I put myself in the mess I was in because I chose to run away from home and pick the first guy I found instead of being smart. I was dumb and young. I also didn't have a parent to teach me any better either, not that I blame it on my Mom entirely. There has been times when I have wanted to strangle A, I am sure there has been times he has wanted to strangle me. We can't get enough of each other. We have NEVER been apart more than 1 night since we moved in together back all those years ago. We got married on October 22, 2010 and nothing really changed, just my last name. We love each other now just as much as we did the day I walked into his apartment for good. 

He said it was so amazing those first few nights because he said it was like watching a caged bird being set free. A has always said that even though I am still like a child at times, I have grown quite a bit from those days all those years ago. I told him the first night we were together, it would be hard. I have issues and I knew some of those issues would be a challenge to deal with at times. He said he was ready for whatever challenge lay in front of us. There were nights I would wake up screaming that someone was taking me away from A. Even after 16 years together, I still have those nightmares. They are basically that I can't get to him, or something is keeping us from being together and they are awful nightmares. I usually wake up sweaty and screaming my head off. I also have really bad troubles with sleepwalking now too. However, I know that all I need in my life is A, and I wouldn't be able to breathe without him. Everyone that knows us, knows how crazy we are over one another. We are so crazy about each other, we work together and sit together at work. We would rather be with each other than hang out with anyone else honestly. I mean we do have friends, but our friends just don't understand how a married couple can be so close to one another. Once I walked away from the mess and into A's arms for good, I wasn't letting go no matter how hard someone tries to pull me away. 

Did my ex-husband ever bother us? Yes, he did a little. Once he seen that all his control was gone and I was happy where I was and that I was never coming back to him, he left us alone. 

Did my ex-husband ever remarry? Yes, a woman that is the same age as my Mom. Apparently, he doesn't treat her like he treated me. I guess my ex-husband knew that he could control every move I made because I was so naive and young. 

This is my story, it has been shortened a little due to me not wanting to go into every detail of the abuse. I am forever scarred because of those seven years. I don't mind to answer any questions if anyone has any and I know its not the most exciting of stories, but it does feel good to tell it.

ax40pt,I remembered surpressed memories and more,"4 days ago. 4 days ago I remembered that 4 or so years ago my sister's collaborated with each other to sexually abuse me. Not getting graphic, my oldest sister would lay on me. My other sister would help her by telling me the same lies. They did this to me some time while I was 8-10 years old. I'm 14 now. They did it to me for around a year. 

Whenever I feel panicked, nervous, or anything, I get this feeling of a heavy weight crushing my chest down and restricting my breathing. I can't be near where I remembering it happening, and I can barely talk to either of them let alone look at them or be near them. I've been doing worse mentally than I have in a while, but this has completely crippled me. Often I can feel a crushing weight on me or other things. I don't know how I'm going to be able to focus this week for school, and the only thing keeping me from killing myself right now or slicing my arms to hell is a person in Connecticut. 

Although I'm even more uncertain about this, I think my parents emotionally abuse me and have at times physically abused me. 
My mom will slap me occasionally, and has punched me for things like leaving my boots too far into the hallway. My dad threatens me often, and will sometimes step towards me quickly as though he's about to hit me. Although my mom apparently, according to her, didn't know about this until a week or two ago, my dad used to make me kneel on a hardwood floor facing into a wall for hours on end as a punishment. I remember so many things about it, about how the corner smelled, how dusty it was, how painful the floor was especially because kitty litter sometimes made it's way into that corner, and I remember how I could hardly stand for a good hour afterwards and how my knees were sore for many many hours after, and how it was usually every day for a good 3 years. Now my knees hurt often and will occasionally and randomly collapse. And just the fact my mom didn't know about this because my dad was my main caregiver at the time makes me scared of what else he might've done.   

I'm still not certain any of it is even abuse, except for the shit my sister's did. 
I self harm and have attempted to hang myself twice and have suicidal thoughts often and all of it increased since I remembered what my sister's did.

ax4hwq,Please help me,"This is a whirlwind but I'll try to keep this as concise as possible.

My mother is schizophrenic and left me, my old man, and my infant brother when I was 9 years old. When she left, my old man began sexually abusing me. He was physically abusive as well, and left me to raise my infant brother as my own son at the tender age of 9 as he drowned himself in videogames every night.

The abuse continued until I was 14 years old, when we had a 16 year old girl move in next door. He knocked her up. The cops/CPS were called (by her school I think), but her mother said she wasn't going to press charges against him because she figured out my old man would be their meal ticket if she kept the drama to a minimum. CPS recognized I was suicidal over the abuse, so they removed me from the home for the summer.

When school started again, I was forced to go back home because my dad said I was just crazy like my mom and was making shit up for attention and for whatever reason, they believed it and sent me back to him.

The abuse increased tenfold and he and my new teenage step-mom ganged up on me daily. Yes, they married and still are. lol

I didn't bother to report it. CPS didn't believe me the first time, and if they did believe me, I would be separated from my brother. My thought was no one would adopt a suicidal teenager who was pinned as being psychotic, at least not in the same house with her kid brother. So I swallowed the abuse to keep my brother close.

Eventually it got insanely out of hand, so I started staying at friend's homes instead of going home. I just stopped going home until I turned 17. In Texas, you can't be forced to go home after age 17 so I was free at that point.

My dad began abusing my brother in my absence, and eventually my brother landed in ICU. My brother blamed me for that saying it was because I left. If I had just stayed and endured the abuse, he wouldn't have gotten hurt.
In his world, I should have stayed there and by the way, he just fucking graduated high school this past year. I would be damn near 30 and still living with my old man in his world, I guess. I wouldn't have dated or went to college or anything.

But I shouldered that guilt for years because I did, and still do to a degree, think it's my fault. If I had stayed all of this time, would my dad have abused my brother? I don't know.

I wanted to tell my brother about the sexual abuse and that's why I absolutely had to leave, but I never mentioned the sexual abuse because he was already having a mental breakdown at that time. I didn't think he could take it, because he was forced to remain living with them since CPS decided an anger management class was sufficient for my old man and my brother was a young child who realistically wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

I told CPS who said charges couldn't be pressed due to lack of sufficient evidence which I still don't understand to this day. So I figured keeping my mouth shut from my brother was the best course of action, for his sanity and well being since he was trapped there with him. CPS had doctors conduct a physical examination of my brothers and confirmed no sexual abuse to them occurred so I wasn't worried in that regard.

I told the rest of my family about it though, since they were confused why me and my dad stopped talking to each other and why I was removed from the home. They basically said they weren't going to do shit about it whether it was true or not. That meant I could either play nice with my dad or lose my spot in the family. I left my family, but I couldn't leave my brother.  

On a side note, my mother popped back into my life during my teenage years, and when I told her what happened to me when she left, she said I deserved it for seducing my father away from her. Schizophrenia at it's finest I guess.

So, for years I played nice with my dad, so I could continue speaking to my kid brother who didn't have freedom or his own phone. I wanted to make sure he wasn't being abused, and of course because I wanted to keep in contact with him. My dad held all the cards as his parent and legal guardian, so I played nice to have contact with my brother. I realize now this was probably a mistake since it ruined my credibility later, but I can't change the past. I also don't know what I could have done differently.

So for years I just bit my tongue and shook and popped pills any time I had to be near the man for the sake of my brother. I suffered immensely.

Fast forward to now, after years of being told I couldn't bear children, I am finally pregnant. Instead of a round of true congratulations for this blessing, I have been met with people telling me now is the time for me to be a big girl and make amends with my dad for my unborn daughter's sake.

Then it hit me. I'm having a daughter. I can't continue to play nice anymore. It will put her in danger. I can't let her be near my dad and be abused like I was. So I finally, after a decade, told my brother what happened. I explained why my relationship with him has been so strained all of these years, why I stopped being invited to family holidays, everything.

There's so much more than what I detailed here, but I told him everything. He said he wasn't surprised and that he loved me. I was so happy and relieved and wondered why I didn't say anything sooner.

A few days later, he blows my phone up saying he just can't convince himself that it happened and he can't believe me unless our father straight up confesses he did it.

I begged and said that obviously wouldn't happen, he wouldn't unravel a decade's worth of lies but he went up to his face and point blank asked anyways.

Of course my dad said ""no I never molested her. I abused her physically, yes, but never sexually. I am so sorry she lives in a world where she thinks I molested her and I will pray that one day the Lord will heal her from these lies. Please know that I don't hate my darling daughter for spreading these untruths, it's not her fault that she lives in this world, may the Lord be with her.""

And my brother goes ballistic saying how my dad is some great guy, he repented for his sins, found Jesus, why can't I forgive him, why would I lie, etc etc.

I cried harder than I ever did when our dad abused us or when our mom left us. I am the most hurt I have ever been. I told him I can't deal with this. I can't deal with him calling me a liar after everything I did and sacrificed on his behalf. I said I don't know how I can even continue talking to him if that's his attitude.
I literally cannot believe that he would choose to think I lied about our fathers sexual abuse, when he suffered physical abuse from the man firsthand. I truly thought he would be the one person who would believe me.

He starts crying and threatening to hurt or kill himself because I am being selfish asking him to ""betray"" his father after he mended his relationship with him. 

That's not how I see it though. I told him I never asked a single person ever to cut my dad out of their lives. I only asked to be believed. If anyone wanted to keep ties with him, I supported it. Instead I was not believed entirely and if it were true, to suck it up for the sake of the family.

I didn't tell him because I wanted him to cut my dad out. I told him because I wanted him to stop pressuring me to build a relationship with our dad for my unborn daughters sake. And because he keeps saying he is going to have kids with his current girlfriend and i figured if he's grown enough to have babies, he's grown enough to know the truth to protect them (he's 19 btw). I told him this repeatedly.

Instead he says he doesn't believe me and how could I just wake up one day and ruin his world. He wants me to pretend the conversation didn't happen and to ""continue having fun"" with each other like always.

I said I couldn't continue to swallow shit and suffer for his comfort for the rest of my life and he screams I am selfish and hurting him and I can't make him responsible for my lies by leaving him...

I'm scared to death. His girlfriend messaged me saying ""he loves you don't do this to him"" and he keeps threatening to hurt himself unless I make it better somehow. 

How can I make it better?

Is the solution to really swallow it and pretend like shit never happened, and push away the thoughts that he thinks I lied and sabotaged our entire family for the rest of my life?

And he really believes that if I do that, that he can somehow be truly happy in our relationship... I told him it would just be fake and he popped off with some shit like ""you're calling me fake, nah I'm a real man"" you know, shit a child would say.

What the fuck can I do reddit?

I feel like I am losing and almost wish I had never said anything at all.

Almost.

I told my brother I didn't regret speaking the truth even if it destroys us, because I know that even if he doesn't believe me, he will think twice about leaving any of his children alone with our father. 

But I am incredibly sad that the responsibility is placed on me to make everything better.

He says if I don't continue talking to him like nothing happened, then I am abandoning him. Because I said I could not continue to talk to him like nothing happened after he called me a liar over the greatest tragedy to befall our entire fucking family.

Am I abandoning him?

He says I am forcing him to choose between two people he loves and that I am making him responsible for lies about things that never happened by doing so.

I feel like he has abandoned me, but he says it's the other way around. He says it's not right for me to expect him to choose my side over our dads when the man claims innocence. But it's cool to call me a liar, the person who sacrificed everything for his happiness.

I think the answer is for me to step away from him until he can come to terms with the truth, realizing that may never happen for the rest of our lives. The thought alone destroys me but I can't figure out another way.

He says that means I am abandoning him. I was always the one person who never left him, and now I am leaving him, in his mind and words. But he will be there for whenever I am ready to come back and face the truth and be nice or some shit.

What can I do reddit?

Anything?

Please help me. I'm having the biggest crisis of my life, feel like I'm being continuously punished for being abused and standing up against it, and I've already had an extremely stressful pregnancy.

ax67a8,How did I let this happen?,"I left my abusive ex two months ago. I don't know how I stayed for four and a half years. Everything about being with him dismantled everything I like about myself. I used to pride myself on being a strong and independent person yet I let everyone convince me that I needed to stay with him because I couldn't take care of myself because I was having pseudo seizures and panic attacks from my PTSD. I stopped reading first, then I stopped drawing, then I stopped cooking, and eventually I found myself just staring at walls during my free time not knowing what to do with myself.

&amp;#x200B;

The PTSD wasn't that bad. It was pretty bad for a 6 months or so a couple years ago but I got a lot better and I learned how to take care of myself through my mental illness. I kind of internalized the thought that I wasn't well I wasn't right in the head and he took advantage of it and made me feel like I needed him. I had some shitty behaviors from time to time but I was always working on it and I was always getting better in that aspect.  I taught myself how to stop having seizures through the ground work of CBT.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know how I let myself feel dependent on someone. I've always prided myself  on being strong willed and independent. I was that 14 year old kid that  did all my own groceries, I cooked all of my own meals, I did all of the  cleaning in the house and I took care of my mother from time to  time. It was intoxicating to feel cared for and protected because no one  had done that for me since I was eight years old and I didn't know what people do when they take care of others. But he was completely  unwilling to help me see a doctor and get help, he just wanted to  pretend he was taking care of me. And then also complain that he had to treat me like a child while I was doing all of his laundry and cleaning up after him for two hours a day.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end, the only time he would talk to me was when he was ranting about guns which he knew was a topic that made me extremely uncomfortable because of a death in my family. He kept all of my documents (my passport, my birth certificate, my social security card) in a locked room with all of his guns knowing that I refused to go near his guns.  I was waking up at 6 in the morning everyday just so I could make him breakfast, iron his shirt, and fetch him anything he asked for.

&amp;#x200B;

He broke me, or at least made sure I stayed broken. I don't really have any close friends and now I have to move to a new city yet again with very little idea of what I'm doing. I feel so lost and have nowhere to really turn to. I just desperately want to feel at home somewhere and I have no idea when that's going to happen.",SevenSpacePiranhas,2019-03-04 03:42:13,1,545,24.43,13.94,91.33,53.36,22.71,11.93,93.58,60.92,22.75,17.61,13.58,0,0,3.85,0.18,4.95,3.85,13.76,9.17,6.06,8.07,2.2,20.73,1.83,1.1,2.2,1.83,2.02,5.5,3.49,2.02,0.55,0.55,0.37,7.52,0.37,0.18,0.18,3.85,14.68,3.3,3.12,1.28,1.83,3.12,2.39,1.28,0.37,0,0.92,2.57,0.55,1.1,0,0.92,7.52,0.92,1.47,2.39,2.2,1.47,9.54,7.52,0.92,15.05,1.47,5.69,8.44,1.1,0.55,0.92,0.18,0,0.18,0.55,0.18,0,0,0.18,0,11.93,4.22,2.2,0,1.47,0.18,0,0,0,2.02,0.37,1.47
ax8o9m,I wrote a thing while I am processing,"Its written like poetry but really its just to get my thoughts down.

Cw. Rape, emotional abuse

She is ready to apologize
How dare she
The you who hurt me so deeply 
Isolated me, abused me, 
Raped me

She is ready to apologize
My stomach in turmoil, and so is my head
my throat can't scream, 
A fiery toad invading my vocal chords
Much like when I was with you

She is ready to apologize
Will it be like the other times?
Have you finally heard my voice after I 
Kept screaming for two years?
Who told you to apologize?
It most certainly wasn't me, though I have tried

She is ready to apologize
Who will this serve, me or you?
I have gone, flown away and accepted that our pearch is gone without needing 
Any or another explanation
I am on my own after so long
Forgiving myself, comforting myself
Loving myself

She is ready to apologize
Two years i tried to convey it
Two years you didn't hear
My screams, my pain, my agony
No, another had to tell you
My voice hoarse from the countless
Times I tried to communicate
Battles I fought just to be beaten 
Battles I had no way of winning
Battles that ended with me losing
Not only the war, but 
myself

She is ready to apologize
Even now I want to deny it all
Even now I am conflicted, humiliated
I was lost and you hid me further
That abyss of mud I couldn't crawl out of
The earth inprisoning me, I can't breath

ax9vv1,I’m tired of this crap.,"So I’m 19 years old and I’m on a gap year because I struggled and didn’t do so well in high school and I decided to better my marks by rewriting my exams. 

I’ve also decided that I’ll drop to math literacy so I can get an even better final score. However, my father is against this, he is adamant that I stick to core maths, even though I don’t need it. 

He’s also constantly making remarks on how I failed my exams and that if I had “worked harder” I’d be in university and I’d have a job instead of just sitting around wasting my life. 

I try to tell my mom what he does (parents are divorced and she lives far away)  but whenever my mom confronts him about the stuff he does, he always lies and just changes the story. 

I’ve already started to take matters into my own hands regarding the maths, I mean it’s my life, I’m 19, I can make my own choices.

axewyx,I'm [F 18] in love with my best friend [M 20] but am stuck with my abuser [M 23],"Over the past 4 months I've been stuck in a codependent relationship with an alcoholic and a drug addict and hes brought we down with him hard. Hes never hit me but hes very controlling and verbally abusive. He threatens to cheat on me, threatens to kill my friends when i hang out with them, and manipulates me constantly. He's pressured me into sex and made fun of me when ive told him no. There are positives but theyre hetting less and less and hes been spiraling and they're not even worth it anymore. He's also kept me on a steady diet of drugs to keep me complacent. I tell him I dont want nothing harder than weed and acid and he comes home with coke and morphs. I know its my job to say no but im a long time addict and its too hard for me.

The breaking point was the other night at my best friends big party on saturday when my bf forced me to do a line of Molly in thr bathroom with him. My friend walked in and looked so hurt and disappointed. When we got home I realised my boyfriend was tottaly hammered and i was enraged. I yelled at him and called him out for a bunch of emberassing things he had done to me at the party. Then he threatened to kill my best friend saying 'ill hang that little bigger quicker than shit'. He also went on a rant about how another one of my friends (a chick who had helped me through a panic attack at the party) was a trashy piece of shit and why would i wanna talk to her not him.

The next day we had work and when I tried to get him up he refused. I said if he cared about me he'd get up for work. He didn't even look at me. He still hasnt apologized. He's just pulling his whole woe is me act. 'Everyone hates me, i should've known this would happen'.

 The next day at work my friend stopped by to see a movie (i work a movie theater) and i pulled him aside and just cried.  I told him that my boyfriends mistreating me and that im just tired. So now im going to see him in a few hours and im nervous. Im trying to get ready and my boyfriends just ignoring me and when he does say anything to me its rude or about how i dont care about him. 

There's a lot more to this situation than I can even write down. Like the fact we're deeply truama bonded and that I live with him and our finances are totally intertwined. I just need your opinion. My friend is always there for me emotionally and cares about me a lot. He's also flirted with me and i really like him. I want out of this relationship but i don't know how. Im so tired man im just done. 

TL;DR: my best friend is the person I want to be with but my dead beat alcoholic boyfriend has been abusing me and keeping me doped up on drugs. im trapped and dont know how to get out.",bpdbarbie00,2019-03-04 16:56:08,0,560,15.77,38.74,51.67,6.15,16.47,10.89,93.75,62.32,23.57,20.36,12.86,0.89,0.18,6.25,0.18,3.21,4.46,13.57,10,7.5,9.82,2.14,19.64,4.29,2.68,2.14,0.89,1.79,6.79,2.5,4.29,1.07,2.86,0.71,14.46,0,2.5,0.36,7.14,8.93,0.71,1.61,1.61,1.25,1.25,3.04,2.5,0.71,0.89,0.71,3.21,0.36,2.32,0.18,0.71,11.25,4.64,2.14,4.11,1.79,0.71,6.43,12.86,0.54,12.5,1.61,6.43,4.46,1.25,1.79,0.54,0.36,0,0.54,0.89,0.36,0.36,0,0,0,11.61,5.89,0.54,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,0,3.04,0.71,1.07

axn8vo,My (35f) boyfriend (34m) threw his phone in a fit of anger. Is this a deal breaker?,"Me: has had an abusive childhood, and an abusive marriage which I left 5 years ago. I go to therapy twice a month to work on the damage.  I’m upfront about my triggers and past abuse.

Him: also divorced, ex-wife got addicted to adderall and had a mental breakdown and her personality did a 180. 
 
We: dating for 7 months. He doesn’t have a license or a car but is saving. 
Yesterday I told him I was going to throw out my living room furniture because I had it when I was married and I hate it and I’m ready to get rid of this stuff. He freaks out and tells me he wants to break up because “this is chaos out of boredom, and doesn’t want me to have a mental breakdown”. We talk about it and agree not to break up. 

Today: he was having an issue with an app on his phone, got super pissed, swore for about  a minute straight and then whipped his phone at my bedroom wall. I told him he made me scared in my own home and I don’t like it. He said he didn’t deserve to be with me and packed all his shit.

We talked afterwards and he agreed to go to therapy.
I told him he can’t stay over anymore and when we go on a date it has to be a date and not just hanging at my house.

TL;DR; boyfriend threw a tantrum and whipped his phone at my wall. Is this a red flag?

axreac,"My boyfriend acts like a completely different person when drunk, is this a red flag?","X-post from /r/relationships, my post got removed and they said to post it here :/

For context I'm 18f and my boyfriend is 25. I don't know if I am being overdramatic or not but it's a little weird. I'm not distressed about it but it is strange. We have been together for 3 months now.

I stay over at his house almost every night. When sober, he's nothing but caring, respectful, funny, and sweet and we connect really well even though there is kind of an age gap. He's introverted and more quiet but seems like he feels really comfortable with me, and I'm the same way.

But when he drinks, he just acts kinda crazy. To be clear, he rarely gets drunk and does not drink that much, but when he does, he drinks liquor and gets really fucked up. 

There have been two times when he was drunk and drove like an idiot. Honestly I was kinda drunk too so my judgment was impaired and I wasn't thinking about how dangerous that was.

And the main thing is when he's drunk he is super rough with me during sex. I'm okay with that to some extent but I didn't really like how it just happened and he didn't ask me, like he just put his hands around my neck. 

I know some people like that but I had no experience with that and it surprised me. And he left 4 hickeys on my neck that really hurt for about a week afterwards. And he bites me really hard. A little bit of that is okay but he went too far and it hurts. 

 I also remember that when he's drunk he kept jokingly calling me a bitch. I remember last time I was calling him names back and we were laughing but when I sobered up and recalled that, I didn't like it. He was being really mean. Yet when sober he is just nice and kind and cute.

I remember the first time he got drunk he said some comments like ""I do what I want"" and ""I get to choose whatever happens.""

We took a shower last time and the next day he told me that in the shower he pissed on me, said ""I just wanted to let you know about it."" He said that he wanted to before but he only mentioned it while drunk. I told him I was okay with it but I don't like that he didn't ask for my permission.

So yeah, I'm confused how to feel about all that. I will say again that he rarely gets drunk and 90% of the time always seems to look out for me and just wants to spend time with me and make sure I'm okay, like he always picks me up and calls me, asks about my life and talks to me about my life, etc, generally acts like a good boyfriend but there is this one thing.

Tl;dr: boyfriend acts sweet and respectful normally but rough, loud, and weird when drunk and idk how I feel about that. 

I like him because he acts way more caring about me than any other person I dated before and he seems like a good person.",SaltierThanACDawg,2019-03-05 14:50:37,18,561,5.24,28.42,61.91,69.45,18.7,8.91,95.37,61.68,23.35,17.47,9.8,0.71,0.18,6.6,0.18,5.88,3.03,10.16,8.73,10.52,11.94,2.32,17.65,6.24,3.03,2.85,1.25,1.78,6.95,4.63,2.32,0.36,0.71,0.36,12.48,0,0.71,0,7.31,14.44,2.85,1.25,1.07,2.67,1.43,6.24,4.1,0.53,1.43,1.6,4.46,0.71,0.53,0.36,2.85,5.53,1.78,0.36,1.6,1.6,0.18,6.42,10.16,0.36,11.59,0.89,3.57,6.95,0,2.5,0.53,0.18,0,0,2.67,0.71,0.89,0.89,0.18,0.18,14.8,5.17,3.74,0.18,0.18,0.18,0,0.18,1.07,3.57,0,0.53

axvaio,11 years of torture,"I forget if what I wrote this time has any disturbing content, but just in case, beware. I just don't want to reread any of it. Stuffs hard enough to live. 

For years, I've been slowly tortured and bent into the crude shape of the person that I am. This is a true story that's the summary of the last 11 years of my life, told to the best of my ability. I am 16,so obviously I won't remember everything, but I'll do my best. It'll be a long story though, so get comfy if you plan to stick around. 

Everything began when I was about 5 or 6. Before then, my brother had always been a role model, fun, full of jokes, and always ready to help out. He was the person who taught me how to write my name for God's sake. But that began to change. Gradually, but definitely. He began poking fun. Name calling, playing annoying and harmless jokes, etc. Just regular big brother stuff. Being a bratty little kid, I would cry out over the little things and didn't know how to control my temper, but my parents still tried to step in cause I had always been a sweet kid too. Picking on me has always been a big 'no' because of my sensitivity. So that's how it stayed for the time being. 

It didn't really escalate until I was a bit older, maybe 7. I was playing with a train set in my brother's room and he started to tell me to leave cause I was ""playing wrong"" or something. I told him no, considering that I've always been stubborn as a mule, this wasn't surprising. We bickered for only a moment longer before he picked me up and slammed me against the wall. Though he wasn't a big kid (being only 18 months older), he's always been strong as hell cause he's always liked a variety of sports. And I was pretty small, so it's not weird that he could do that. Of course, once I got my footing, I left quickly. I know this happened because I drew out what happened in a tiny notebook that I found while cleaning out my room recently which made me want to write this here. Of course, this story isn't something to lose sleep over, but I haven't gotten to any of it yet. 11 years is a long time. 

Again, there was a quiet period. I was a very happy kid, so even though my brother got on my nerves, I had always been smiley. But a lot began happening. My brother had constant breakdowns, yelling, screaming, threatening, lots of ugly stuff. And my dad has always had a similar temper to him, so arguments tended to last. But there were a few that went so far that I had to leave the house with a blanket and lay on a couch we had on the deck till it calmed down. Looking back now, I'm surprised at how calm I was, usually being enamored by the number of fireflies overhead or by some sound coming from the yard, rather than the yelling and crashing from the house. My parents, being by no means abusive, sometimes would hit my brother. Not hard, because again, they're really lovely people, but my brother wasn't learning anything. Yelling wasn't enough. 

It's kind of blurry for the next couple years, all I remember is that we tried counseling, other forms of punishment and coaxing, but he wouldn't stop. 

Here are a couple of key memories when we were  still young that I will never forget too:
One, we never got along, even on Christmas eve. But one year takes the cake for the worst Christmas eve to ever happen. December 24th, 2012. My brother and I had been fighting again. When we're put to bed, my parents and other relatives tend to have the TV on outside, so we used to talk in quiet, angry whispers so we weren't heard. That night, I don't remember much that was said, but I do remember one thing very specifically: my brother telling me that ""I'd be better off dead than alive. "" Now, I was 10 at the time and that was the same year that my mom was sent to the hospital for heart issues, my dad had to go to work 2 hours away because his company couldn't afford to keep him (he was a chemist and their project was extremely expensive, so he was let go along with many other employees), and the year that my mom's account was robbed of 1000+ dollars. Thinking back, this may have been his way of letting off steam, but still. I was a little kid, not to mention his sister. When I tried to tell my parents, they didn't believe me. So I went to bed, teary eyed and defeated. 

Another memory comes from about 2 years later. I had done some pet sitting for a family up our street for a sweet cat named Rascal. I loved going over and playing with him and he seemed to enjoy it too. So, they generously paid me with around 60 dollars and a case of those nutella to go things, along with a case of tic tacs (they had them because they worked for the company). I decided to bring the case to school to split amongst my friends, so I put it beside my bag. My brother, however, decided that wouldn't be the case. He picked it up and held it over my head, now towering over me, laughing and telling me to just give it to him. I told him that I wanted to give it to my friends. Then he said “what friends” and started to carry off the case. So, being angry at this point, I got into a little fight. I punched him and tackled him, knocking the box from his hands before he slid me into a wall, snatching the box and taking it from me. I tried telling my parents, but they didn't believe me and said that they were going to get rid of the case. He wins again. 

I don't exactly remember when this next one happened, but I do remember that times have only gotten worse since with him. He's noticed that he's begun to break my once happy and resilient demeanor. So he tried to drive it home. One day, I was playing on the desktop since its the only computer we had at the time. I was playing Minecraft, as I did, failing at many of the games that I was playing, but still having fun. I had closed the door, hopefully to not allow the sounds of the keyboard outside of the room. My brother loved taunting me until I left the computer, considering that he would then hit it for the rest of the day and late into the night. Not to mention being one of those people who beat the screen and the keyboard when he lost. Sadly, he did hear, coming in, uninvited, and sitting directly above my shoulder. He breathed very loudly on purpose, right down my neck. I have always needed personal space, so he knew that this was a step too far for me. I told him to sit down, and at first all was fine. Then, he began to tell me that I was doing stuff wrong in the most annoying way possible. I just ignored him. So he became bored and asked if I could get his headphones. I said no, considering I was in the middle of a game and he could just get them. So, he huffs, leans over, and turns off the computer while getting his headphones. He ‘innocently’ apologizes before standing up and saying that I should get his phone for him. Angry at this point, I do. I pretend to hand it to him, but I instead throw it outside of the room. Though it was unscathed, this was a big mistake. As I tried to quickly close the door to lock it and keep him out, he slammed it open. He was pretty angry by now and got into my face. He said “you better apologize right now.” So, thinking I was some kind of toughy, got right up in his face, glaring directly into his eyes. I said “make me”. He almost did. I never apologized, but he proceeded to hit me, not with baby hits, but with hits of actual brute strength, the first of which would've knocked me down if I didn't have the adrenaline pumping. Not only that, but he hit the same shoulder, brutally, five times. Each being harder than the last. Somehow, I managed to keep my composure before closing the door where I promptly began to cry. I don't bruise easily and that bruise lasted me for around 2 months, tender to the touch, meaning I had to walk around with my bookish slung on one shoulder unless I felt I could bare the pain. I only showed it to one friend about 3 weeks after that event. She didn't want to believe it. I did tell my parents, but by then they couldn't do much, so they yelled at him and all that, but not much more happened. 

This is all I feel up for now. I'm going to continue soon whether anyone cares or not, considering I want my story somewhere to be found by other struggling people. It does get worse and even kind of weird and I'm too tired to deal tonight. Maybe tomorrow I'll finish.",JEBFinn,2019-03-05 21:36:35,6,1614,33.09,34.57,84.44,23.82,15.67,13.75,93.18,59.48,20.2,14.13,8.98,0.62,0.12,3.72,0.68,6.01,5.51,13.57,9.17,6.57,7.87,2.35,20.2,4.89,2.04,1.18,1.8,1.61,5.82,2.79,2.91,0.19,1.49,0.37,11.15,1.55,0.25,0.25,4.46,12.76,2.04,1.49,1.61,2.35,1.73,4.46,2.35,0.31,1.36,0.56,1.67,0.93,0.43,0,0.19,7.99,2.42,1.43,3.1,1.36,0.62,9.36,6.82,1.3,16.91,1.92,7.5,7.81,1.49,1.24,0.99,0.31,0.25,0.12,0.06,0.06,0,0,0,0,17.53,6.32,7,0.12,0,0,0,0,0.68,2.97,0.37,0.06
axvax1,My boyfriend the verbal abuser?,"Me: 21F
Bf: 28M 

Y’all.  I’m in serious need of some help. 
Some background:
I lived in a single state all my live, until I graduated college, and moved 2000 miles away by myself. I had no one. 
** also think my bf might have bipolar disorder.

I make hella good money. I have my own house, car, and plan on taking a vacation in July. I’m pretty well off. 

I met boyfriend on Tinder. Boyfriend and I have been together about 3 months or so. 
Around 1.5 months he was struggling to live (didnt have supporting family, bills, etc.) and I asked him to move in with me to at least get him back on his feet.  (Like I said, I’m pretty well off, I have means to support him.)

Everything has been swell except for a few hiccups every now and again. (Like all relationships do.)

I wake up at 3am to get ready for work. This morning, I woke up 15 minutes or so earlier than my alarm. I had a message from an ex on Facebook. Not really a huge deal to me. This ex was from like 8 years ago. 

Ex and I had a casual catch-up chat for a while... then asked if I wanted dick pics. Of course I said “no, aren’t you married??” (His Facebook showed he was recently married). ex read it and didn’t respond.

Now I’m not supposed to have my phone on me at work, but I sneak it past sometimes just to get shit done. (Its a common thing). Bf woke up did his morning stuff and I said I had a weird morning. I explained everything and sent screenshots and just said I blocked and removed him. But I wanted to be clear with him. 
I thought things were fine. I even deleted some social apps because I’m tired of things like this happening. 

I get home from work. We watch GoT together, I knit, he plays on his phone, we make dinner. After dinner though I wasn’t feeling well and fell asleep.... for 3 hours. I woke up and he was irritated, and I told him I was sorry, I didn’t feel well. I was gonna go lay down. 

So I go lay in bed for a few minutes, and get super nauseous. I run to the bathroom and proceed to well... yeah. 

Bf comes in asking if I’m okay, then immediately says we’re going to the hospital because I’m getting sick. I just told him people throw up when they get sick, it’s fine. I’ll be fine. 
He was super bitchy and said I “didn’t want to go because I’m probably hiding something”. 

I’m irritated. He’s mouthing off dumb comments and I just tell him to get out and take a walk. 

***side note: I return to home state later this month to recruit for work. Hometown is where ex is, 2 hours from where I’m going for work

Anyway, bf is mouthing off telling me that he’ll leave so I can invite whoever over. Or talk to who I want. That I just want to be single for when I go back to home state and I can meet up with ex and fuck. 

Now, bf has an ex wife who cheated and an ex gf who basically did what he was thinking I was doing. I’ve never broken his trust or done anything to even think. 

His side comments and backtalk is what hurts the most. When I tell him I need a minute, he just says that I’m not listening to his feelings and I’m the one with the issue. That I am treating him like a child and not listening. 

I need help. I don’t know where to go. Like I said it’s not often, and when he does it, it’s intense. I can’t take much more of it. I’ve told him I don’t deserve it and that it needs to stop. 

He rollercoasters his emotions and goes from angry to understanding he’s the issue, but then straight back to telling me I’m the problem. Am I the problem?

ay1f91,Molested by the golden boy of the family,"Let me start this with the fact that I am now 26 years old and this occurred when  I was about 6 until I was 13.  I don't really k ow what to do now. I would like to tell my family but, my cousin, let's call him ""GB"" is the golden boy of the family. The one that was chosen to protect the younger cousin's ( we are all girls btw) I am the youngest. 

He is 3 years older then me so he was 16 when this all ended. I understand that we when children when this All started but, I'm.still hurt. Some people told me that we were both young so I should forgive him his child curiosity. But, he was 16 when this was over and that I cannot forgive. He started  by playing house with me and   having me show him my body and it was routine. I came to his house, he built and fort then he would force me to strip. Poke and prod then tell me to.dress and it would be like nothing happend. 

This all took a drastic turn when I turned 9 and he was twelve. In my family we develop very fast. I was already a set of very noticable brest and my body was changing already curving . People used to think  was 13 already. This when he started making me give him head. It was so embarrassing I would cry but he would make me do it for what felt like hours. Then he started trying to make me have sex with him. And at 10 he did it. 

Forced his way inside me and tore away do violently and locked myself in the bath room. The next time he forced anal on me and I tore. It was horrific I had to hid that from my mom. The bleeding and sting. He would  force anal sex on my for the next 2 years. Untill I was 13 and I got my period. It was like he no longer wanted to touch me. I thanked god that I got my period be ause it all stopped. But, i have been scared now. I can't be in a room alone with a guy for two long or I have an anxiety attack. I am trying to love my self but I feel my body is dirty. As a defence I made it so my body would be undesired by intentionally putting on weight and scaring my body.  Now I'm losing weight and I just keep having this fear that when I do he will come.back. or I will garner to much attention for men like him. 

My boyfriend tells me I'm beautiful and he loves me but, I cant except it after what has been done to me. I dont know what to do I cant tell me family they wont  Believe me.

 It eating me up inside I want to do all these things with my boyfriend but a smell, a touch, even a word will trigger me. With all the time me and GB  spent together my family thought we were thick and thieves and really he was just keeping me close and making me fear telling the family. He side that he would make them believe that it was all me and I believe him ...hell I still do. I dont know what to do. I'm scared. This is running my life and not the other way around.

ay3bbz,Support/advice on filing restraining order.,"So I'll try to make this as brief as possible, but I know it will be long.

I(21) live in CA, my mother(52)/brother(26)/husband(26)/and myself are filing for a restraining order against my father(48). He is mentally abusive and uses intimidation to keep us from leaving or standing up for ourselves. My father constantly threatens me, throws things at me, puts me down over any small disagreement, he punches walls while yelling at me.

 He also physically abuses/ed my brother by punching him,slapping him, throwing him against walls, and of course mental beat downs. He gets physical with my mother by pushing, shoving, elbowing, or doing anything that doesnt leave a mark to get him in trouble. On occasions he has yanked her off a boat dock, that caused her to fall and get scrapes&amp;cuts that left lots of scarring.

 Another occasion he threw a remote at her while she was asleep in bed and it busted her lip causing bruising/bleeding and swelling. When my mom took pictures he freaked out and made her delete them because it was "" just an accident"", he meant to throw it at the wall. She told people at work that the dog accidentally headbutted her.

I have video proof of how intimidating he can be and how disregarding he is of other people. In the video he is screaming at my grandfather(95) threatening to beat him up because my grandfather is wanting to stay at the house with his daughter/my mom to make sure she was okay. He then tries to smash my grandfather with the garage door and elbows my mother in the chest for trying to stop him from closing it. It then goes on for another 10 minutes of him screaming at us and us trying to stand up for ourselves.

My mother is extremely worried the court will deny her request for a restraining order because it could escalate the situation.

ay6p3a,A Letter to my Father,"Hi dad,

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why you acted like you did. Its been two years to about the day since I've seen you, and its been weird. The day that you left, I felt this great weight off my chest. I got sent to the office of the dean, to talk about things, and I told him that it was honestly for the best. That while my father was a horrible person, it was all over, and now I could move on with my life. I talked with my friends, who were sorry for what happened, and I reassured them that I was fine, and that everything would be better now that you weren't in my life. I thought that I could put you in the rear view mirror.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember the things that you told me about my mother, and about women in general. It's a shame too. While I get close to my female friends and whenever I flirt, I get this voice in my head ""All women are cheaters"", or ""If someone is nice to you, they want to take advantage of you"". I can't silence it, it seems like, and no amount of therapy or self-discipline has changed that. For years I hated my mother, believed all the lies that you told me, making me a prop in order to insult my mother, and feel more powerful in the relationship. Those are 16 years that I may not get back, where I resented my mother and threw away opportunities to bond with my mother.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate the way that you hurt my brothers. That you justified hitting and bruising my autistic brothers, causing them harm, as a form of ""Discipline"". And I accepted it, and stood up for you. I failed my little brothers. One of my Brothers still flinches whenever someone screams. I don't know if that was the autism, or if it is you, but it certainly couldn't have helped.

&amp;#x200B;

I flinch towards yelling too. My Professor yelled in class earlier this year, and I went back to my dorm and shook. It was like being taken back to being in front of you. I am reminded of you constantly. I thought if I forgot about you, went somewhere miles away with no one who knew about who I was or who you were, that it would solve everything. You would be left behind. That hasn't happened, unfortunately.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate to write my name. I hold my middle name and my last name are your name. Every time I write it, I am reminded about where I came from. That I am one of you. That I have the same genes as you. It makes me disgusted.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I've decided to do something. I've decided to air my feelings. To air what I have kept bottled up for the last two years. I thought I might do it on Facebook, but I don't want people to know my story, especially small work acquaintances, and I don't want my face attached to this. So I thought I might post it, on Reddit. No one here knows who I am, so this is me, making my thoughts public and faceless. I hope this makes me feel better, to write a letter to you, and have it be open. To allow my feelings to become public in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely,

&amp;#x200B;

ay8312,Is this abuse?,"I'm new to the whole reddit thing so I apologise if this isn't how you do things.

When I was 15, I met Bill* via Facebook, he went to the same school as my half-sister so we had a lot of mutual friends. We ""dated"" for roughly 2 weeks, but me being 15 deemed that as a ""proper relationship"". I would go over his house every night, and usually we would hang out in the living room but he really wanted to go upstairs and ""listen to some music"". I said yes because his family would always be in the living room, so I saw this as my opportunity to finally get to know him. We did listen to music, and I can't really remember what happened in between but he ended up on top of me. I was terrified because I didn't want to do anything sexual, some people may use the word ""frigid"" to describe me. He practically begged me to allow him to do sexual things to me, and I kept saying no. I finally said yes after he wouldn't stop asking, and even when he was doing the things he would continuously ask for more. It only stopped when my dad called to say he was outside to collect me. That was the last time I ever saw Bill*, but we still messaged each other.

A few days later my step-mum (C) revived an email off of my birth mum (L). (L) told (C) that Bill* had told my half-sister everything he had done to me, he told her the marks me had left on my body and the things he did to me in full detail. He told his whole school. I showed my step-mum the marks but I said the sexual things weren't true. My mum hated me and even said it was my fault, and my mum's side of the family completed disowned me. They didn't even ask me first what had happened, she went straight to my step-mum. My dad and step-mum are really strict, so she knew I would get in trouble (I didn't but she doesn't know that).

I don't know whether this is abuse or not, but this does affect me. I am depressed and fear I'm suffering PTSD (which I do not like to chuck around). I have flash backs and I can't stop myself from self harming. I'm engaged now and have moved country to be with my fiancé, but my birth mum still resents me. When I first told her I was moving away, she assumed it was because I was pregnant and even asked my step-mum (before me) if I was pregnant. I was a virgin when she did that, but she wouldn't believe me even if I told her.

ay8mzs,"Distasteful words for those who don’t understand, but want to.","I’ve been betrayed time and time again, my ability to trust ripped out my chest and thrown into a box labeled “interesting concepts”. The loss of my heart then tossing what few relationships overboard the ship that is named life. Yet I, although young, I am the unwilling captain forced to navigate these vicious waters on my own, thrown into the position of authority to survive due to whom I thought to be my savior being too doped up to function. I learn fast to live, but learn to hate those around me but despite my bitterness still hold the ability to wield unparalleled compassion and empathy. With a sour taste on my tongue I obey. I comply. I submit. I, despite all odds, live.

And that much genuine hurt.. it takes time to heal. And it may not heal completely, some wounds will scar over. And on dark days I might look down and see the scars and be reminded of times I thought forgotten. And, maybe just for a moment, subconsciously wince at the long subsided pain afflicted on me all those years ago. Just a physical memory burned into my nerves and carved into my actions, instinctively flinching away from the fist you thought you saw whaling down on you like before. But in reality was really just a friend reaching out for your shoulder, and with a sudden blush of embarrassment you shy away from the offended and confused looks from those around you as they say “you know I would never hurt you. Why would you think that?!” The obvious irritation dyed the words crimson in my mind as they left their lips and i clench my fists as if to calm the building flutter of momentary fear. I look away so helplessly with a twinge of guilt, and think “no.. I do not know that you wouldn’t hurt me” because hurt is all I’ve ever known. But I bite my lips and smile and say “I know” and shrug. “I know.”

Now, when the breakup happened, she told me she loved someone else (they were in a relationship) we broke up in mutual agreement, 5 hours later I check on her, she said she was going to burn herself in her bath, she was going to cut herself, she was going to starve herself, Note, I was crying uncontrollably the entire time, she then said something that stopped all that sadness, I love him, but he loves her and always will. I felt emotionally numb. I had to deal with her problems, and on top of that she told me to go talk to the person she loved to make sure he’s okay. Now, I couldn’t sleep that night, my brother gave me a hug when I woke up. Three days later she contacts me trying to pressure me into telling me who she liked, (Which was the ex) I didn’t tell her, we get into an argument, she guilt tripped me heavily, then said she was going to punch a wall, then logged off. Insert more crying, then one of my friends showed me way more compassion than my ex had showed me, she said I was always happy and bubbly and *Ex* was ruining that, then said she found me a nickname, Sunny, during that time I cried, a mix of happiness and sadness, but I felt happy, happier than I had in a while. Then, my ex asked me out two nights later, I spent 10 hours trying to find a way to say no without hurting her, then I said No, I have to move to Hawaii (This is half true, I just wanted to keep the happiness I have.) 5 hours later she found a new bf, she began practically shoving in my face she was happier with him, she said how they kissed and cuddle, and to say I was sad was a understatement, I put all my effort into making her happy, one of my friends decided to try and help me, he messaged my ex telling her to fuck off, and a bunch of other shit, she left me alone, then Two nights later, she contacts me with a sob story about how she was deleting her insta, I was feeling extremely depressed that night, (something I haven’t told my friends, but I was generally considering cutting myself that night, I had began to burn my hands with hot water when I took showers like halfway through my relationship with her) my ex blocks me and I thought it was finally all over.

Around a week later she makes a post on her public Facebook saying I had manipulated her, I learned through my now best friend Julia, (The person who also introduced me to ex) so I make a post saying “should I defend myself?” Ex gets mad, tells me to fuck off, then her friends threaten to bash me, I was fucking fuming because the dumb fucking cunt had publicly slandered me, I told her to take the post down (she did an hour later, if she went to my school, I probably would outcasted, I’m glad she doesn’t) then, the apology happens, I’ll explain in another paragraph later, but let me explain pre apology, ex cuts her foot on something, one of her friends I’m still friends with says that she cut her foot, I say why the fuck does this concern me, somehow this derails into me talking about the breakup, I tell the friend my side of the story, how I was depressed and shit. Then the friend tells me to talk to ex, I refuse then finally agree to try.

Now, let me tell you something, I am expecting the worst, but she seems quite calm. I explain that friend told me to talk to her, then she reveals, she stole friends phone, talked to me for an hour about the breakup, then proceeds to apologise for everything she did (I don’t think she actually meant it as she only apologised, and did nothing to fix my reputation) I accept it like the little softie I am and then tell her to never contact me again, now, I want you to decide if she was abusive, I have no idea is she was or not, one of my friends who was abused in the past claimed she definitely was. But I want more people to decide, I am now in a happy relationship with my new boyfriend, he has genuinely made me happy, I have made him happy. We were friends for two years and he confessed he developed a crush on me, I liked him back. I hope everyone in this subreddit gets out of their abusive situation and hope they recover well, I have become more quiet persay, but that is the worst that happened to me, I am much happier and haven’t harmed myself at all.

aycuwo,My past abuse is having an impact on my current relationship. Help.,"So I'll try to make this as simple as possible. I'm currently 20F, but at the time I ended my relationship with my abusive partner I was 18.

Me: Me.

P: Abusive ex boyfriend who is currently (24, but 22 at the end of our relationship) 

F: Guy I'm currently dating who is currently 24 (Ps best friend since age 11)

So I recently had an experience that I won't go through that changed the way I am as a person a LOT it made me think about what I want in life and made me really appreciate the people in my life. It made me decide to hit up F (who I was friends with when with P) because I'd always had a crush on him, but was with P. I had missed F a lot and wanted to get back in touch with him and felt I had the courage due to this experience, we've been dating for about 5 months and it's had its ups and downs like any relationship, but I really enjoy our time together and having him in my life. 


P and I were together for 3 years, I was 15 when we started dating and he was 19 (yes, messed up, redflag, but not the main issue). Half way through our relationship I admit to doing probably the shittiest thing I've ever done (I was 17) and cheated on P. I admitted to him immediately after what I did, was profusely sorry and he ended up forgiving me and we tried again. It was tough, but he understood my circumstances, understood my idiocy and gave me another chance (I feel now that even trying again was a mistake as things were not going well at all up until I cheated anyway). Before I cheated he was manipulative, strict and cruel. As a young student, I did not have a job and any penny I had would go to him or go to seeing him as he lived in a town away from mine. He would tell me off and say I was wasteful for spending my money on things for myself or things I enjoyed. And would be very strict about me having to go see him on weekends and having to be there at a certain time very early in the morning, if I was even a little bit late (if the bus was late for example) there would be hell to pay. All of these aspects got worse after I did the incredibly shitty thing I did despite the fact he forgave me and we were trying to move on. 

It got to the point where I would say sorry multiple times a day for doing something wrong or saying something wrong. Like being a couple minutes late because of the bus, doing homework so not being on my phone and able to speak to him or for just saying something and him misinterpreting what I had said and then using it against me. He'd often tell me I wasn't putting enough effort into our relationship and use me cheating to emphasise his point, despite us trying again. It was as if since I'd fucked up so badly he finally had something to manipulate me to the fullest extent with. He'd make me go to his house even more often, after UK college, stay the night etc. Even if I said I couldn't because I had to do homework, revision or had family commitments. There was no saying no. As well as this, occasionally when he was upset with me (even over very little things) he would ignore me completely for days on end, no contact whatsoever then suddenly come back, make me apologise (even though I already had a million times) then act like nothing happened. I just put up with it getting worse and worse and thought that he would settle down when he realised I wasn't going anywhere and wasn't going to hurt him again. 

It did settle a little bit (or I just got used to it who knows) but starting the last Christmas we were together.. Things got so much worse. We'd been doing well. But I had no money due to not working (P wouldn't actually let me work and would talk me out of it because he'd have less time with me) and couldn't ask my parents for money because we are quite poor. So when I finally got money 3 days before Christmas I told him that I would take him shopping to get whatever he wanted and then after getting money at Christmas from family and friends that I would take him out for a meal. He said that was fine and seemed understanding I kept apologising profusely for not being able to get him anything sooner because of not having money. Christmas eve came around and I was just finishing wrapping his presents and writing on his card, I had £30 left which I was saving. We were going to exchange gifts on boxing day. However, I get a call from P and he says that I should come and give him his presents that night, I explain that I can't because I'd have to get a taxi there and back and that it would be incredibly expensive on Christmas eve and that I also wanted to spend time watching films with my family. He insisted. And when he insists.. I had to. So I went gave him his gifts and despite him choosing them he was disappointed. He gave me mine, and I was honestly, disappointed with them, they were all cheap items he had gotten cheap with hotukdeals and other websites, which I don't mind (it's not the money that counts), but it was all stuff I wasn't interested in and wouldn't want as if he didn't know me, but I took it was happy because I knew he tried and I knew I'd find use for them, which I did. He didn't even get and write me a card (he'd bought one he just couldn't be bothered), but I wrote him a huge card telling him how much I cared, not a space was free. He didn't. About a week later and he shouts at me for not pre planning his gifts (despite the fact I did, but just couldn't order them because I had no money until a few days before, I explained this several times but then told him that I would get him the gits I had planned soon anyway, but I had wanted it to be a complete surprise). He continues telling me off for this pretty much for the next 6 months (when we finally break up). 

In a past relationship I had been forced into sex. I was also groomed when I was 9, which made my relationship with sex difficult. I had told that P within us early dating. 

Then about 2 weeks after Christmas this happened.. I won't go into detail, but I have pretty bad depression and sometimes it causes me to have really low labido when usually I have quite high labido. We hadn't had sex in a few weeks. P started saying that sex was a big deal to him (after saying all of our relationship that if we couldn't have sex that we would still be together because sex doesn't matter to him), I explained why my labido was low and explained that it'll sort itself out soon enough and just told him it's okay, just be patient I'll be back to normal in no time. So he told me if I didn't have sex with him that he'd break up with me. So.. We had sex. I didn't enjoy it, infact it hurt a lot. Afterwards I told him he'd forced me and that I really didn't like it reminded him of an experience with an ex and he apologised. He was crying and saying he'd never do it again. So I forgave him. It happened at least 5 more times. Each time he got more aggressive until I was literally just saying no. We'd be lay in bed, I'd have college early the next morning and he'd grab my legs until I bruised through his sexual frustration. I'd try to stop him, but he'd just continue to do it. Sex was painful. And my labido was lower than ever. He made me believe at times that I owed him it because of me cheating on him about a year and some before. He made me really hate myself. 

Then everything got worse, but I pretty much pretended it wasn't. I did everything he said. I was nearing my A level exams, it was really important, but he was making me go to his house all the time. Then shunning me for not doing homework etc. But he hated me doing work when I was with him because he said he thought that we should pay attention to each other when together, but would happily leave me to watch TV on my own because he wanted to play video games with his friends. He would ignore me for days more and more. I would errange plans and he'd cancel them that day leaving me stuck at college because I had to get a college bus home or to his and the college bus home left earlier than the one to his house. He would belittle me. Make me feel like crap infront of our friends including F. He would have a go at me for not responding in time, or not responding as indepth because I was doing work or if my phone wasn't receiving messages or something else I couldn't control. But when he left me for days (upto a week) without speaking to me, apparently that was fine. He would still expect me to pay for things for him all the time despite having no income and no time to get an income. He didn't like me spending time with my family, he didn't like spending time in my town or with my family so I always had to go to him. When he changed jobs he got a job near my college and I'd see him on lunch, he'd ask me to see him on lunch. He'd get annoyed when I didn't message him back despite being in lessons. He didn't like me having other friends. He told me off for going on my first ever club experience (with all female friends) because clubbing wasn't his style and ""clubbing is for single people"". But I had intended to marry him and spend the rest of my life with him and just wanted that usual teenage experience. I had asked him if he wanted to go with us, but he said no. I was going on a caravan holiday with my family and had asked if he wanted to go with us months before. He said no. I said okay, well I'm still going to go. A week before I tell him that I'm going on a family holiday on that week, but coming home 2 days early as I had forgotten that I'd booked my driving theory test. He had a go at me for it because I hadn't told him, I reminded him I'd asked him and he said ""yeah, but that was months ago you told me"". He didn't speak to me all of the holiday or even when I was home for 2 days. I tried calling him because I was in a rough area at night to get home after the holiday and he ignored me and I was like ""please I'm just really scared"" he said that he didn't care and didn't care about me at the moment. I tried calling him to say that I had passed my theory test, he ignored my call and my message. He would ignore me at least once a week for 2 days. He would tell me off for speaking in a discord of our friends (one of which being F) because he wanted me to talk to him, so I told him to get in the group discord and he said no because he wanted to talk to me. I don't understand why he couldn't talk to our friends too, that I had barely been able to talk to because of being busy. 

One night he threw things at me hitting me in thr face. Pushed me, screamed at me. Just because I asked him to to move over a little in the bed because I had my legs completely off the side of the bed (I learned my lesson after this and would just not sleep instead to avoid making him angry).

He was sexually, emotionally and physically abusive and this is only the tip of the iceberg. I repressed a lot of these memories until I casually told them to a friend and he urged me to get out of the relationship. I told P about the sexual abuse and how if somehow I can get over that we can carry on, if he'd apologise or make me feel more comfortable with him or something. He didn't. So we broke up. 2 weeks he begged for me back and I repressed everything again until I got with F. 

When I started talking to F the prospect that I might end up seeing P again brought back all these memories and emotions that I had hidden away in the back of my mind to try to protect myself. I was struggling anyway, but realising everything, a year and a half on, and the possibility of seeing P. F talking about P even. Has been so difficult for me, it brought back the trauma of the relationship and I was able to fully tell a friend about my experience and I was like holy shit that was so messed up! And they were like yeah I know! But I just didn't realise it until now. 

These trust issues. The fact that Ps name burns in my ears. The fact I feel like the worst person ever for what I did to him, and that I keep telling myself he was in the right because I cheated even though everyone (including F says that it's no excuse for him to rape me). I feel I always have to be perfect and when I mess up I try to run away. So I'll say something to F and he won't be hurt or offended by it it'll just be me saying that I didn't like the way he did something in our relationship and he'd be completely reasonable, but I instantly start apologising and saying I'm awful and that he shouldn't be with me to the point where I have the compulsion to end it because I'm so scared of saying something he might dislike whether big or small. My insecurities and the way I react are having an impact on my relationship and F says its okay and that he understands, but he doesn't know what to do and it's hurting him because I keep trying to run from him and he just doesn't know what he can do to stop me from doing it. The more he feels this the more I want to run. It's something I feel I can't control, I get panicky, hyperventilate, stress, cry then tell him ""we shouldn't do this anymore, I'm a horrible person and I'm sorry"" I don't know what to do because (whilst we've not said it yet because we're taking it very slow.. I love him so much and no one makes me smile as much as he does), but I'm genuinely fucking it up and I don't know how to calm myself down into not saying this dumbass shit that I really really don't mean. 

Any advice? 

P.S. Cheating is bad, if anyone wants to lecture me on that go ahead, it was 3 years ago and I know not to deal with my emotions like that so you telling me it's bad and horrible.. Is completely pointless.",thelostarch,2019-03-07 05:55:54,0,2712,12.23,36.3,66.97,7.73,21.87,13.27,94.54,64.12,24.19,18.44,10.69,1.22,0.07,6.16,0.29,5.75,3.87,12.79,11.1,5.97,9.59,3.06,21.42,4.06,2.32,1.55,1.18,1.73,5.01,1.66,3.21,0.44,1.14,0.63,14.09,0.33,0.55,0.04,6.23,14.12,1.88,2.4,2.36,2.99,1.33,4.79,2.65,0.37,1.44,0.63,1.33,0.37,0.26,0.55,0.11,8,3.13,1.25,1.84,1.22,0.66,9.11,8.08,1.36,14.79,1.77,5.53,7.82,1.33,0.74,0.77,1.07,0.29,0,0.88,0.33,0,0.22,0.15,0.11,13.64,4.72,2.91,0.11,0,0.04,0.07,0,0.29,3.87,1.62,0

aygt09,Mother of my kids/current GF is she abusive? What should I do?,"So.. I had kids with a girl. We're young. I'm in my mid 20s, she her early 20's.  


It's a bit of a story.. I'll try to summarize the best.. we've had a rough road. We were sweethearts in high school. Shortly after she turned 18, we accidentally got pregnant. So.. I wasn't ready for a kid. I knew I wasn't. Nor she, but she wanted to keep it.   


In those days I liked her a lot. But... my family was also very unhappy with the news. Their scorn combined with my fears kind of lead us down the path of considering abortion.. annnd.. we did go through with it at that time. She was highly against it but for my sake and per the request of me and my family she did end up going through with it. It really messed with her emotionally however and.. I saw the pain. It tore me up. We were young, and stupid, and I felt so horrible for it all. I didn't know how to deal with those kinds of emotions and I also cared for her and how she felt and I just.. didn't know what to do. She really wanted to baby. I hated seeing how broken she had become.  


After some time it became apparent that she was emotionally scarred to boot from this. I wanted to try and make things right. Not just for her, but because.. I felt as though it was a major fuck up to do what we had done in the first place it brought questions upon my morals that I had never had to confront before myself. We conceived a child.. we ended up having beautiful twins.   


I love my sons more than anything in the world they are healthy wonderful little guys living it up at an undisclosed age right now.  


But despite all that... the fears of commitment struck me again, hard, during the pregnancy. I wasn't sure if I could see myself in such a lifetime situation with this girl. I had second thoughts. It pains me to say it and have to admit before anyone that this happened but it is the truth. I cheated during that time. Before the children were born, I confessed to her of this act. It really fucked everything up. And once again I was left wondering what the fuck have I done. As any newfound happiness was quickly snuffed out by my selfish actions, yet again.  


But, we stuck it out. We've been together for years. We've been through hell and back by now. She has obviously had severe issues trusting me. I don't blame her for this. The children came, we moved into parenthood.. and I tried to work with her on everything for a long, long time. I've tried to be patient. I've tried to take the blame. I've tried to be reassuring to the maximum degree. I've given her the benefit of the doubt a million times but.. this cheating act drove a wedge between us that I fear never will heal.  


She does not want me to ever masturbate, she isn't comfortable with me having a job or seeking a higher education. She is not comfortable with me having a phone. She is not okay with me being on the computer alone. She is constantly tripping out thinking I'm doing something wrong no matter what the situation is. She is younger than I and has virtually NO family support all ties are severed in that department except perhaps with her mom whom she literally never saw past childhood due to parental divorce and that woman and her family are all sorts of terrible.. both of her parents were heavy drug users of many substances and her dad ended up with custody and her mom ended up out of state. She never saw her until basically adulthood.   


However, I am stuck in a difficult over-my-head situation. She has no license. We live off all the assistance you can get currently. My family, specifically father, has fronted the bill of all expenses for years for us. It's not fair to him. Our relationship issues should not keep me from being a working man. I would love to pursue a real job in some field that I enjoy. But I'm telling you I can't go to the store unattended without a large fight. She has all of my passwords to everything digital that I touch. This includes social media and games. I have allowed this type of behavior thinking it was being transparent but.. it's evolved into a hypercontrolling type of situation wherein even simply browsing normal reddit is scrutinized severely and often met with strong attitude.  


My social media messages to me from her are largely in part terrible hate mail. There is no sweetness left between us on there. We have definitely had our fair share of arguing in person I've tried to meet this increasing communist reminiscent lifestyle with resistance but each time it just results in disaster. Neither of us have any friends. She prefers it that way. They're all gone.  


I live virtually. Through games, essentially. That's my social life. As you read this the information laid before you makes it appear as though my life is a big screaming match. No, I am passive mostly. I know fighting it just drags this shit out and we do have children in our home.. we have tried to stay together for their sake but as time goes on, even though I can keep it peaceful in our house through malicious compliance... it has become apparent that.. she hates me. She has no license. She has health issues, I'll give her that, like.. back problems and pains a lot. A severe infection took her down a rough road. She is considered medically frail.  


But she has no wish to ever work. No ambition. This is absolutely killing me. She has let herself go to a large extent, too.. health conditions aside.. she is huge now. I am an average decent looking dude. She is gaining weight and not slowing down. she refuses to eat right, refuses to work out.. it's bad. And with the way that she was raised.. her father essentially turned her and her siblings against the very idea of her mother. She luckily grew to think for herself later in life and has patched things up with her mom and met with her and even visited, alongside me, for as long as up to a month. Her mother appears somewhat normal but she's into.. still questionable activity that I wouldn't deem acceptable as an environment for my children such as smoking marijuana. As for any other substance god only knows. I would assume she likely at least does pills however often I do not know.  


With my girlfriend (we obviously never wed because of the trust issue she has severe aversion to it) being such a, for lack of a better word, dead beat... with no ambitions... it is a big fear that my kids will end up out of the state I reside in with my family. Far away from the family that has ALWAYS financially supported them and cared for them.. and living alongside her and her mom/her moms boyfriend who are quite frankly.. not suitable.  


I'm left wondering what in the all hell am I to do. How do I escape this hell.. she hates me but we stay together.. I obviously don't love this anymore. As much as it pains me to say it as she berates me currently because I arranged for her to go to the doctor with a ride from a trusted family member.. I am not really in love with her anymore. I tried to make things right for years.  


I don't want my kids ending up in that environment... but as far as anything I know.. I don't have a job right now and.. I don't have lawyer money.. The only money we have is provided via my dad to help care for my sons and live off of.. he can hardly spare a dime and he can't keep this up. We're unwed. As far as I can tell from all reports.. in the state of Indiana.. you have no right to your children as a man who is unwed during their birth and thereafter unless otherwise appointed in a court of law.  


And the housing issues with the duo lease and.. everything. She is keeping me DOWN. I am stuck in child mode into my mid twenties having my dad handle so much shit for me when I need to be not catering to this suck-ass relationship and being a real adult like everyone else... I am scared to leave.   


There won't be another woman in my life.. nobody wants a dude with kids.. much less a dude with kids.. who has permanent disease.

&amp;#x200B;

**""I think you both brought something to that table.""**

  
 Yeah. This one time, I was leaning over to check on him and then he decided to hold a knife to my throat, threatened to kill me, and then *demonstrated how he would do it*. We both brought things to that table: I brought concern, he brought a weapon. That's the funny thing about tables, if one of you brings a place setting and the other one sets the fucking table on fire then yeah, I guess you both brought something.

**""A guy doesn't do something like that without provocation.""**  
**""You know how bad his childhood/self-esteem/ptsd is, you should cut him a little slack.""**   
Have you ever, in your life, held a loved one at knife point? How about grabbing that loved one by the back of the head and yanking them around while you press the knife all over their body, describing in vivid detail all the places you'll cut them so they bleed out? If you need me to explain why violent assault is never okay then I can't help you.

**""Can't you just let it go?""**

  
 Nope.

He's an abuser, and the bookstore is his camouflage. I'm sorry, too. I loved the bookstore for years before ever getting involved with that trash. But I suspect he knows that without the bookstore and its strictly enforced obligations, he'd actually have to work at friendships and at not being a terrible person. I don't think there's a delicate enough social surgery to extract his cancer from the store and I am sorry for that, but the facts remain; hours, days, even years from now you'll be reading the next account of something horrible he did while drunk/damaged/because PTSD.

ayli4k,Could I have been sexually abused?,"**WARNING: VERY LONG**

**(Using a throwaway account, so don't be alarmed)**

Here's a break down of my regular life. 

I am 14 years old as of last January, female, with two elder brothers. My parents are both happily married. My only problem is, I can't remember anything past 3 years old up until 8 years old and I only began to realize a strange pattern throughout my life. I barely remember bits and pieces. 

My father has always been a bit too playful, and sometimes goes very far. Ever since I was young I remember my dad holding me down and making me kiss him in a ""playful way"" or tickling me, all while my mother just watched and laughed. Sometimes he would even mockingly hum songs when he grabbed my wrist and forced me onto my back onto the ground. Every time I would cry and squirm and he would say something like, ""Why are you crying?"" or, ""Stop whining, i'm not doing anything to you.""

I have no idea how to word this, but every time he speaks or grabs me as he does now (By my wrist usually, and forces me to hug him or kiss his cheek. And I hate every moment of it. Every time he speaks and such, my private area will...tingle? Not in an incestuous way, not even in a good way. Just uncomfortably. 

When I was a child, I always remember having sexual feelings. I would regularly touch myself out of pure curiosity. I would get caught sometimes, and always. Always it would be my dad. He would come into the room and ask what i'm doing and I would always say ""Nothing."" and we would leave it at that. 

&amp;#x200B;

**These are my last memories I've had before it basically goes blank. Nothing.** 

When I was young, I remember another friend showing me pornography when we were young about 6-7 years old at this point. I was, obviously, very interested and would search it up on the family computer and just...watch it. My family had never been affectionate at all and is actually very cold towards me and my siblings so seeing a lot physical contact as a kid and on a computer screen was interesting at my time. I got caught and eventually just forgot about it. I was too young to understand and even now I have never thought of searching up pornography. I was caught by my mom, who took my kindle fire away from me and threatened to tell my dad when he got home. I had no idea what the big deal was but I decided not to question it until he came home.

When he came home, my mom took my dad into their room for a discussion and came about a few minutes later into the living room, where I was playing and snatched the controller out of my hand and shut it off, before roughly grabbing my wrist, bending me over his knee and spanking me. I still remember the pain and confusion of this. Why is this happening? Why am I being hurt by someone I was supposed to love and trust. I never got answers to these questions as I was grounded for about a week after and I haven't seen it since. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some things I should List off-**

My parents have never trusted me again after the porn incident. I now have an app called MMguardian on my phone that has GPS and controls everything I decide to watch or look up, even with a GPS tracker on it so it knows my every move. My dad is always on it, consistantly. He gets aggravated if he can't see my GPS on the map and even calls me to ask what i'm doing and why it isn't registering. 

I don't trust him and he openly says he doesn't trust me. I don't give a single damn if he trusts me, that sounds like his own problem rather than mine. I've tried too hard to gain from him and only lost more. 

\-Everytime i'm in pain or cry he only smiles and shrugs his shoulders in a nonchalant way. If I complain too much about it, he throws a fit and says ""Why can you never be okay? There's nothing wrong with you."" 

\-My dad touches my mothers private areas regardless if i'm in the room and smirks at me while he does it, and usually I just have to leave the room and cry because I don't know what else to do. 

\-I can't help but squirm and feel violated when he's around 

\-Everyone always loves my dad. Always. He's brought up very well and affectionately and no one has ever gotten a weird feeling around him. 

\-My older brother, the middle child, is 1000000% the favorite while i'm treated as if I quite literally don't exist. You may think i'm joking, but i'm not. My fathers never been as touchy to him as he has me. 

\-I keep having nightmares about being grabbed by my family, almost always my dad. Usually forced against my will following him or being forced against a wall, sometimes even held onto a bed. Not in a sexual way, but in his ""Playful"" way. 

\-My mother would kill me if i ever brought anything up to a therapist, family member, or friends/friends parents. 

\-My mother is a stay at home mom, while my dad is a truck driver and I am home schooled.

I'm going to ask my aunt if I can live with her, and she has always told me if there is something going on in my house I am always welcome, regardless of the circumstance. No need to contact the police, I'm going to ask my aunt this weekend if she's free for me to stay awhile. She lives in a very tiny town and almost half of them are friends of my aunt. I never got any strange feelings around them, so that's worked out. It feels like something inside hurts every time i'm around my dad. Not in a teen angst way, but after reading the post you should get it. Should i be worried???? Surprised???

aymna2,Is it too late to press charges?,"4 years ago, I lived in Salt Lake City. I had a bad coke habit and found a new dealer that I thought was really cute. We started hanging  out and within 2 or 3 weeks I moved in with him. He introduced me to a world I had never seen before and I was so infatuated. A world that was so troubled and dark and messed up but there was something about it .. about him that I couldn’t shake. 

He revealed to me in the 2nd week we were dating that he had kidnapped 2 people (a guy and a girl) that he thought stole something from him at a party at his house the night before. They had fallen asleep and in the morning he held a gun to them and told them to get in the car. He drove them 2 hours out into the middle of a desert in Utah and left them there alone. He was planning to kill them and then couldn’t bring himself to do it, and left them stranded.

At the time I guess I thought I wanted to help him. I wanted him to love me and let me in.

About a month later, I was having a hard time and felt suicidal. We sat on his bed and I cried, saying how I didn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel and how maybe I’m not meant to be on this Earth. He said to me, “Don’t say something like that if you’re not gonna do it. Don’t be a pussy. Kill yourself. Here.” And put a loaded machine gun in my hands yelling “Fucking do it!!!!!!”

Two months later, were having sex. He had a phone out, I thought he was taking pictures as that was a regular thing. He started laughing this demonic laugh. I looked back at him. He was going through my texts and saw an old text calling someone “Babe.” He threw a metal chair at me and loaded his Scorpion machine gun with hollow points and said “There’s so many things I could do to you right now.” For some reason as I sat on the edge of the bed I repeated to him what he said to me. “Don’t say something like that if you’re not gonna do it. Don’t be a pussy.” Looking back I don’t know why on earth I would say that. He took the safety off and aimed it at my head. All the sudden I jumped up off the bed and started screaming for any of his roommates. He had 5. Only one woke up. We were wrestling for the gun when our friend came in. After that night the friend acted like he had no one what I was talking about. The roommate took his side.

Fast forward a year, I move him out to live with me in California. His behavior didn’t change. Cheated dozens of times. I couldn’t bring myself to leave him because he would have been homeless with no money and no job. I was working 3 jobs to support us while he played Xbox all day. 

5-7 times I woke up in the middle of the night to getting punched and/or slapped in the face. He would say it was an accident and that he did it in his sleep, and would never say sorry. I would cover up the bruises on my cheekbones and not say anything.

His phone rang at 11:57pm, his friend was calling. It started him and he hit me in the face. I got mad, and he went back to sleep. He started snoring super loud and I asked him to turn over so he’d stop. He did turn over, but proceeded to strangle me with both hands. Time slowed down, my vision was going blurry. I thought I was about to die. But all the sudden something in me got a burst of adrenaline and I threw my legs up and started kicking him as hard as I could in the neck. It knocked the wind out of him and he fell back. I had bruises around my throat for a week. No one ever knew. And I was working at a treatment center.

I finally got the courage to break up with him when I met another man who treated me better than I ever thought I deserved. This man treated me like he loved me. I now know that he didn’t treat me like he loved me, but that he treated me the way a normal man treats a woman. Respectfully, kindly.. I never thought I would feel the way I do now. I’m not scared. I don’t flinch when he pushes a piece of hair out of my face or when he reaches for an eyelash. 

I should be dead, but instead I’m here, living and happy. I feel alive.

I never pressed charges against him. He seems to have turned his life around, he’s sober now. Recently I’ve been thinking about it thought and  I’m scared that he’s going to hurt someone or even kill someone. His anger is incredible. It’s terrifying. And I’m nervous it will break his family if I press charges.

aynd00,Is it possible that an abuse I barley remember could be effecting me without me even knowing?,"Without any gorey details, I was abused at about 5 years old by my 12-13 cousin who I viewed (and maybe even still view) as a brother. I don’t remember much about it, other than that it was pretty light but awfully manipulative. I forgave him immediately, probably due to ignorance of the situation and the fact that he was pretty much my only equivalent to a friend.

I’m 16-pushing 17 now and I’ve long since decided to distance myself from him for a variety of reasons. I haven’t outright cut him out of my life, but I try to interact with him as little as possible.

Anyways, for the past 7-8 years, I’ve been incredibly depressed. My main issues seem to be how I view my body, my motivation to do anything, my trust in people and general paranoia. I know most teens hate their body, but what worries me is my lack of trust in anyone. Even people I’m friends with I constantly wonder if they hate me and bad mouth me. I always feel like the school staff is out to get me when realistically they probably aren’t. I’m starting to think it might have its roots in my abuse, as that’s what my parents keep suggesting.

I was however, bullied pretty mercilessly in middle school so I’m wondering if that’s the sole cause.

When I think about my abuse I don’t *feel* anything. I don’t get mad, I don’t get resentful I just kind of space out. Is it possible that it’s effected my general state of mind, even though I don’t really notice it?

ayomhf,I'm questioning some of my (f20) dads (m50) actions towards me as a child.,"Just to stay off with saying I've never spoken to anyone about this. I've been having memories over the last few months of questionable things my dad did during my childhood. 

He was verbally abusive towards me and my mother as a child but my memories are of a different kind of abuse.

The one thing I remember is him coming into my room and lifting up the blanket while he thought I was sleeping. He didn't touch me or anything but the next day he said he has came into my room and my hand was down my pants. I knew this wasn't true as I had been awake at that time. I wouldn't have been more then 8 or 9.

Another thing he would do was ask to smell my hands..i don't know foe what reason. But it stopped when I got to the age of 10.

These memories have been bothering me a bit. I don't have a good relationship with me dad for multiple reasons. I just wanted to have someone else's opinion on this incase maybe I'm just over reacting and shouldn't worry.

I was talking to her today and she said ""I attacked you because you were emotionally abusive.""

This really bothers me. Can anyone weigh in?

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked for ways to understand how I could be ""emotionally abusive"". First off, I have no ill intent whatsoever. 3 points that I can think of: (1) emotionally distant, although to me that's because I have severe depression and was on medication for it the first time my ex-wife attacked me for not spending time with her. (2) controlling, I definitely have problems with co dependence but I'm not someone that tells my partner what to do, I just wanted to improve our life in ways.

ayxesz,I’m in a abusive relationship and only a freshman in high school.,"To sum it up, right now I’m 14 and he’s 15 but i’ve been with this boy since the end of eighth grade and we have been going on for almost 11 months. Like all bad relationships, it started of great and then turned wrong. In the very beginning I had a best friend who I had known since kindergarten, she was dating his best friend and we all went on double dates together and it was probably the best months of my life. But what we knew was coming finally happened, and she had to move states. From then on out I was the worst I’d ever been and my boyfriend became his worst to. He pressured me into sending photos and that was the first, biggest red flag. He talked about girls he used to like or found hot to make me mad when he needed to or just to joke and make me upset. I truly don’t even know why. He was very jealous and protective, but those were the main problems only then. Our relationship now is nothing but fighting. He will yell at me over the smallest of things, degrade me of all my self worth, and scream the nastiest of things at me. He’s fake broke up with me so many times and every time he’ll wait till I’m in tears and he says he was kidding, and every single time no matter how horrible of what he’s said or even if the fight wasn’t my fault, the second he’s not mad at me, I stop crying and I act like nothing happened. Because I will do anything to try and avoid him being mad at me. He will accuse me of liking somebody and yell at me for being a no good cheater, but he’s bluntly said how he’s liked the girl I’ve always been worrying about while we are dating or how he’s catching feelings for someone else, how this person looks so much better than me and how I’m to fat or to skinny, and just list all of my insecurities. He makes sure to do this when he knows he’s loosing a fight, just to make me weak. 

I have developed bulimia (when you throw up your food) and anorexia because of him. He always said I was to skinny so I ate till I gained weight and I then started to hate my image so I resorted to throwing up. I’ve become so depressed to where I’ve self harmed. When he finds this out instead of comforting me he yells at me. Mental illness is just attention to him. 

He’s often like this only over the phone, but if he’s angry at me in person he will squeeze my hand till I yell, and grab or punch my thigh and arm until I bruise. My friends have tried so hard to get me out of this situation but I refuse, they have even admitted to giving up on me and just staying out of it because im so stubborn about it. I know what I’m in, I know how wrong and messed up it is, but I love him. Is this love? No, but in my world I’m just used to it and it’s “normal” for our relationship. I can’t imagine breaking up with him and hurting him like he hurts me, because I know how much it sucks... He’s even said to me, the reason he treats me like this is because he knows I won’t leave, because I’m weak. And it’s so true. And I just listen to him say that and do nothing but try and silence my cries. I’ve pushed away friends, family, help. But through all this I still stay because when he’s not the monster he is, he’s the sweetest thing. He can be the reason I’m depressed but at the same time the only reason I’m happy.",justalostthing,2019-03-08 16:18:09,6,666,8.59,45.8,71.04,1,20.18,11.11,96.7,65.47,23.57,18.77,10.81,0.9,0.3,6.61,0.15,4.8,3.45,13.81,10.96,7.81,13.21,1.8,20.72,4.8,2.4,2.7,1.2,1.8,9.76,3,6.76,0.9,2.7,1.2,14.56,0.15,0.75,0.6,6.76,14.26,2.85,3.9,0.6,2.4,2.4,4.05,4.2,0.6,2.1,1.35,2.4,0.6,1.05,0,1.05,9.46,3.3,1.5,3.3,1.2,1.5,6.16,12.01,1.8,13.81,1.65,6.46,6.01,0.75,0.3,0.15,0.15,0,0,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0,15.17,5.11,4.05,0,0,0.15,0,0,0.3,5.26,0.3,0

ayy35o,Abusive Father,"(Throwaway)

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Started out on terrible terms with my father, developed relationship, relationship turned toxic as he has hair trigger temper and screams at me/puts me down constantly, work full time to go to school and save for apartment, want to move out but do not have the financial resources to do such. 

This will be long, I've done my best to shorten it.

I was brought up in a dysfunctional family. My brother (2 years younger than me) is on the autism spectrum and has bipolar disorder. We were always fighting and this led to verbal and physical abuse by my own mother.

My mother is a prescription drug addict. She overdoses daily on a concoction of drug cocktails which include painkillers such as Vicodin and Oxycontin. She is in an almost comatose state, sleeping for days on end, and when active, has no recollection whatsoever. You can say something to her and ask her to repeat what you said, and she'll just stand there and stare, giving you no response, or ask you to repeat yourself.

My sister (1 year younger than me) is a hermit. She would isolate herself in her bedroom and play computer games day in and day out, only leaving her room to go to the bathroom or get food. She had no social life and lived to play games.

I was brought up in an extremely stressful environment. Between school, family issues, and work, I was so stressed out that I was socially isolated, and had self destructive coping mechanisms such as over-eating, or binging on foods extremely high in sugar.

Growing up, I always remember my dad being verbally abusive. I hated him and everything that came out of his mouth. He never had anything constructive to say and always put everyone down. It was only 3 years ago that I formed a relationship with him.

3 years ago, I finally caught on to the fact that my mother was killing herself with drugs. I never even questioned why she acted strangely so often, but after finding pill bottles and speaking with my father, I concluded she was abusing prescriptions. My father and I started forming a common goal, getting my mother to admit she had a problem and clean up her act. Long story short, she brainwashed my siblings (who I had previously had good relationships with) to think we were toxic, and they left to go live in Yucca Valley California.

Not until after this happened did I start making friends. I changed jobs and my attitude toward school changed. I felt as though a 100 pound weight had been lifted off of my chest after 15 years. I felt happy and free. I made friends at school and had a flourishing social life.

Somewhere along the line my relationship with my father turned toxic. We had both been there for each other and dare I say loved each other after my mom left, but he began to become angry-all the time. Flash forward to now, I have noticed that in the past year my father has a hair trigger. Non-issues or simple misphrasing of words of sentences will cause him from being completely calm and rational to red-in-the-face screaming. He will go absolutely batshit and then gaslight me, telling me that he has an ""episodic memory"" of me doing this or that, and will tell me straight to my face that I am crazy, although I know for a fact this is bullshit. You can *NEVER* dispute anything he says or he will turn it into a yelling match, even if he is clearly wrong. I simply have to accept the fact that I know I am correct about something but say nothing or else I will get screamed at.

I start my workday at 5 A.M. This means I'm awake at 3 A.M. to eat breakfast, drink coffee, take a shower and get dressed, then go to work. I work 8 hours until 1:30, then come home and relax for a half hour until I take another shower (I work at a home improvement store, and my job entails getting sweaty and covered in nasty stuff like concrete mix, drywall, dirt  from sod, etc.) and go to my night class at the community college he teaches at. One day I got home from work and was listening to music and he prodded me and then when I became irritated, exploded and started screaming his head off about things that happened in the past (and were not big deals either, such as forgetting to close the garage door when I parked my car in the garage, not doing exactly as he says when he says it, etc.) I can have my hands full after going to the grocery store (as he asked me to do) and I will have to go into the kitchen to set them down before I can close the garage door, and when I say ""give me a second"" he will scream at me things like ""don't give me any of this gimme a second bullshit, you always say that, close the goddamn garage door). 

I will be friendly to him and he will respond with unprovoked anger. My father has no social life outside of work. He is extremely overweight, and this is due to the fact that he comes home after work and eats while watching television for HOURS on end until he goes to sleep and repeats his routine of going to work, coming home, eating, and going to sleep. It's actually depressing. I on the other hand try to avoid him through my work, school, and socializing with my friends. I have been in fights with them, being called needy, because I will try to hang out with them constantly to avoid my toxic home life which I have completely hidden from them. I have no siblings to vent to, and my friends are my family. 

I firmly believe that my father treats me this way not because he hates me, but because he has no other outlet for his anger, and he takes it out on me without understanding the consequences of his actions. He praises me for my high grades in school and valiant effort at work. He acts as though he loves me, but tarnishes it by exploding at me constantly. When I spoke to him about moving out, he got angry and tried his best to convince me to stay. After community college, I want to go to a university 40 miles south, and had to convince him that I would wait to move until I go there. He also tried to convince me to move back when I'm done there. I'm 18... I've come to the conclusion that once I do move out, I'm NEVER looking back, although I'm saving money now, I do not have the resources needed to move out. I do not spend my money frivolously. I have around 4k in my bank account and rarely splurge on myself. I treat myself to a soda after work and a hot chocolate once every week from a gas station near my house and that's it. Right now I'm faced with 2 options. Move out and work full time and save up enough money to go to school, but put school and my future on hold, or suffer through 2 more years of abuse until I have enough money to move out and never look back. 

I have to remain on good terms with him though as I have a plethora of medical problems that are not cheap, and without health insurance, would not only wipe me dry, but pulverize me with debt.

I feel trapped. I have no one other than my friends to lean on for emotional support, and no one who could help me escape this emotional hellhole financially.",Scared_Bird,2019-03-08 17:29:52,0,1332,44.05,37.34,85.42,8.07,20.49,15.54,91.37,57.28,19.14,14.94,9.61,0.23,0.53,4.2,0.38,4.13,3.68,15.39,7.88,4.5,8.63,1.95,17.27,4.43,2.18,0.98,1.73,0.68,4.73,1.58,3.08,0.38,1.43,0.3,11.11,1.58,0.53,1.65,3.75,9.76,1.88,1.13,0.75,1.58,2.03,3.3,2.63,0.45,1.5,0.6,4.2,0.9,1.95,0,1.43,6.76,2.4,1.73,1.35,1.2,0.53,5.11,10.81,1.58,17.49,3.53,7.43,6.91,2.85,1.35,1.8,1.2,0,0.08,0.3,0.23,0,0.08,0,0,13.89,5.11,5.18,0.15,0.23,0,0,0.45,0.38,0.9,1.13,0.38
ayy9k7,I [22F] am having issues with my boyfriend [27M],"I was told to post this here instead of the relationships tag.

We have been dating for about a year and 5 months. When we first started dating, he was incredibly sweet and romantic. We have our own place together with a cat that I adopted. I've lost a significant amount of weight since we started dating and go to the gym multiples times a week while he has gained 40 lbs and does nothing about it. We almost broke up a few months ago because (and I'll admit), I wasnt treating him the best. I would do things by myself and wouldn't really consult his opinion and he didnt like that. I was being emotionally distant (which I've worked on GREATLY). 

But, since we started working it out, hes been more moody. He is ALWAYS irritated at me if I dont change up my appearance. I recently cut my hair short and because I dont straighten it or curl it, he gets upset. He wants me to wear makeup a lot more. He even threw a tantrum because of me not getting a certain part of my eyebrow threaded. He recently quit his job and has been staying home playing video games while semi searching for work while I cover the bills. He has been hanging out with his sister a lot but is upset because my father is coming over this weekend. 


We also have different libidos (his low, mine high) and if I dont do something his way, he doesnt want to have sex. Dont get me wrong, I appreciate it when he cleans and whatnot but every time I'm actually home, hes just playing video games or on his phone. Am I overreacting in being upset? I love him but this doesnt feel right. He always keeps bringing up how much money I make and that I could cover everything by myself or he wants to go out to eat but I should pay. Am I blowing this out proportion? 

UPDATE: He now wants me to try some insane diet that is severely restrictive and can make me extremely sick. Hes extremely upset that I refuse to try it.",CrazedLuna,2019-03-08 17:49:57,5,372,8.93,42.53,49.78,7.28,15.5,15.05,92.2,60.22,23.92,18.82,9.95,2.15,0,6.72,0,5.11,3.49,9.68,12.63,4.3,9.14,2.96,21.77,4.57,1.88,1.08,0.81,2.69,5.91,2.15,3.76,1.34,0.27,0.81,13.44,0.54,0.27,0.27,7.26,14.52,0.81,2.69,2.69,3.49,2.15,4.57,2.42,1.34,0.27,0.54,2.69,0.54,0.54,0.54,1.08,10.75,5.11,2.69,2.15,1.34,0.27,4.84,13.44,1.34,15.05,1.88,5.65,7.53,1.61,2.42,0.54,0.81,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.9,5.65,2.42,0.27,0,0.54,0,0,0,1.34,1.61,1.08
ayzt1z,My (21F) brother(24M) has been abusing me my whole entire life and I can't take it anymore,"As the title suggests, I have been physically and emotionally abused by my brother my whole entire life. From a very young age, I'd say around when I was 7 or 8, my brothers abuse began to have a significant impact on me. I was being bullied at school and then I would come home to my brother telling me that nobody loves me, I'm worthless, and that I should kill myself. My parents were/are abusive to me themselves so I believed him. The rest of my family lives in a different country so I was/am truly alone. I became depressed from a young age and I honestly wanted to die. I remember one day when I was around 8-9 laying underneath my bed and trying to hold my breath as long as I could so I could die but I realized that it wouldn't kill me so I prayed to god and begged him to kill me so I could go to heaven. Eventually my brother turned to physical abuse, he knew he could hit me and get away with it so he punished me for any little mistake I made. From a very young age, I was walking on egg-shells because I knew my brother was waiting for the chance to put his hands on me. I remember that one day he was unhappy with something I did so he grabbed me by my hair and dragged to where the cats bowls are. He held me down and forced me to eat cat food. I remember screaming for my mom to help me who was only 6 steps away in the kitchen but she just ignored me like she always did when my brother was tormenting me. I would frequently beg my parents to help me, to do something about him because he was torturing me but nothing came of it. And today, now that I am 21 years old and my brother no longer lives in my parents house I still suffer when he comes to visit. He is still insanely disrespectful of me and expects me to do everything for him (dishes, clean up after him, etc.) and when I tell him no he throws a fit and calls me every name in the book. But the part that hurts me the most is that when I try to talk to my parents about it they act as though they had no idea that he was abusing me and that they just don't know what to do now because he won't listen to them. Plus, my boyfriend is tired of hearing about it and it hurts me. I know its not his burden to listen to my troubled past but I feel like I have no one to turn to now.  I'm sorry if this was all very jumbled and made no sense. I'm quite frustrated right now because I feel so helpless. I have so much anger in me and absolutely no way of getting it out.",AmazingRide69,2019-03-08 20:50:27,5,524,9.73,17,85.28,1,22.78,13.17,94.85,64.31,26.15,21.18,16.03,0,0,4.2,0.95,4.96,2.67,13.17,9.16,7.25,9.92,2.48,18.7,3.24,1.91,1.72,1.72,1.91,5.92,0.76,5.15,0,2.48,1.72,11.07,2.67,0.19,0.57,5.53,11.45,2.67,1.34,2.29,1.91,1.72,2.1,2.29,0,0.95,1.15,2.86,0.38,1.34,0,0.95,6.87,3.24,0.38,2.67,0.76,0.19,6.87,9.35,0.95,12.98,2.1,4.77,6.11,0.38,0.38,0.95,0,0.57,0.95,0.19,0,0,0.19,0,0,9.92,4.2,2.29,0,0,0,0,0.38,0,1.53,1.15,0.38

Ok so basically earlier today my friend was taking to me and another friend and he brought up how his dad was abusing him. He didn’t say much but he said he had gotten a 40 or something on a test and his dad got mad at him. He recovered it and got it changed to a better grade but it wasn’t in the grade book yet. I’m assuming his dad though he didn’t do it, or didn’t get a better grade or something because he apparently started whipping him with a belt. I know a lot of parents punish their kids physically but he had visible bruises. We told him he should report it but he said his dad said if he reported it he would have to live in a foster home and he didn’t want that.

az09wq,I don't really know what to call it but im worried its abuse,"So my boyfriend and I got in an argument a few hours ago after I told him I thought he was taking work anger out on me. It got me thinking about all the other fights we have had recently, and I just don't know if its something to be concerned about. Like within the last few weeks he's gotten semi physical when we argue. The first time that affected me a lot was when I tried walking away from him and he grabbed my backpack and ended up like knocking me to the ground in a way that hurt, and the second time was when he tried to stop me from leaving his car and ripped my overalls by grabbing them so hard. After the overall incident we made up, but when we had sex the next day, he thought I purposefully bumped his head with mine and like forced my head back by ripping my hair and hurt my neck. I told him he can't do that during both sex or arguments and he agreed but also thought I was overreacting. I know he comes from an abusive background and so I feel like he would know I guess. I am really sorry about how scattered this is, I just feel so confused and weird about putting this problem on Reddit. I guess I am just wondering if it actually is abuse and if so is it possible or worth trying to talk through with him? Any help or insights or just comments about it would be really helpful, I don't really feel comfortable talking to people I know in person. Again sorry for how scattered this is",iamnothere33,2019-03-08 21:47:59,2,293,13.3,32.87,86.6,1,24.42,13.99,95.9,62.46,22.87,17.41,10.58,1.37,0,5.12,0.34,5.46,4.1,12.63,7.85,9.56,11.6,1.37,19.11,4.78,2.39,2.39,0.68,2.05,6.83,1.02,5.46,0.68,2.73,1.37,11.95,0,0.34,0,5.46,17.06,4.78,2.05,2.05,5.8,0.34,5.8,2.73,0,0,2.73,2.05,1.02,0.34,0.68,0,7.51,2.39,2.05,1.37,1.37,0.68,5.8,9.9,0,13.65,1.71,4.78,7.51,0.34,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,0,7.17,3.07,2.05,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,1.71,0,0
az0j9e,My story *Warning: Long*,"Hello all,

I am new to reddit, but I have this feeling of needing to share my story. You may refer to me as beep or L inside of the comments if you want to comment. For reference, I am 19. So with that here is my story.

I don't really know where to start. My parents weren't really abusive per say. I have a much better relationship with them now, but as I was growing up until halfway or so into my senior year of high school (17), my parents had very high expectations for me. I would work so hard to be a good kid, get good grades, and things just never seemed good enough for them at times. I was a weird kid, who was avoided and constantly taken advantage of. This is the seed where my depression, anxiety, and need to put others' happiness before my own kind of started. 

So I met this guy (we shall call him T) the summer after my freshman year (15). He was two and a half years older than me, and I met him at a distant relative's fourth of july party in another state. I went back home to my home state and maintained contact with him for months before he asked me to be his girlfriend, so right off the bat, we were in a long distance relationship. It all started off good, but then he started to show his true self. He would ask me of pictures and more skype calls. They were innocent at first like me just taking a selfie while being fully clothed or like just being on a skype call for video games and such. Then, he started to ask me for more provocative pictures. First, more revealing clothing. Next, less clothes. I was already very self conscious at that point. I haven't had much experience at all with boys. I felt very uncomfortable. After telling him that I was uncomfortable sending more pictures, he yelled at me saying that then maybe he should just resort to seeking out more porn or other sexier looking girls on the internet. Me being anxious and naive, I started to comply. So, whenever he asked, I would send nudes (Age of consent in my state is 17. I was 15-16 throughout our relationship.) He would guilt me or coerce me into getting into skype calls and performing sexual acts or posing and showing off my body. He said that if I loved him, I would do it. He would masturbate to me during those calls, and I slowly got used to it and desensitized to it. I would always feel really dirty or uncomfortable. He came to visit my house for 3 weeks the following year. A few days before my 16th birthday, he was hinting at us moving further than just kissing and hugging even though just the day before we just had our first kiss. So, I made a joke saying it sounded like he wanted me to blow him or something. I wasn't thinking much of it. It sounded ridiculous to me. Then, after kissing for a little, he said, ""Come on. Do it. If you loved me, you would do it"". I was alone with him, and I felt so guilty about the idea of displeasing him. 

T: ""You have done similar things over Skype. You can just do it here now.""

So, there I was giving my first blow job at 15 years old when just the day before, I never saw myself doing that until I was older. For the rest of those weeks, he kept pushing the bar further and further except having sex because he is Catholic and ""the Lord wouldn't be pleased with him if he did so"". When he was gone, things got worse with the sexual things. He made these names such as Kitten and Harlot. He would ask me more frequently to masturbate or imitate blowjobs on camera. It broke me down more and more. Some times, I found myself taking multiple showers because I just didn't feel right with my own body. He got to the point of trying to get me to roleplay bdsm type things of tying myself up or fantasizing about dressing me up in a bitch suit, degrading me, making me eat out of a dog bowl, and begging for him to take me. I was able to stand up for myself and not have to do it over Skype. He, instead, made me call him or text him to fulfill  that fantasy of his. This led up to when I broke up with him 20 minutes before the clock struck midnight indicating it was my 17th birthday. That was just the sexual abuse. 

There were mind games, emotional, and verbal abuse involved as well. He saw my depression and anxiety developing. He even tried to discourage me from seeking help until after the first year. Initially, it was fine for me to go out all the time with my family, friends, and for my extracurricular activities. After he left my house, he would get more clingy. He would be upset if I didn't text him back right away even though I was in class. He would also be upset when I was out with friends or family and wasn't always texting him during those times too. He would guilt me into staying at home in my room, so that I could Skype him or call him and play video games with him. When I went out with my guy friends, he got really upset. This escalated to even jealousy when I was with my brothers. I was getting more and more distant from my family and friends because he would encourage me to talk to him about my problems and to speak to him so often. When he didn't get his way, he would go on and on about how I wasn't being a good girlfriend. He said those things during our more sexual encounters. He would degrade me. He made me take the blame for every problem we had. If I was upset with him, it would end with me begging for forgiveness. I felt so guilty and indebted to him. I kind of ended up in a Stockholm Syndrome type state where I felt like I would be nothing without him. He was my everything. 

A week before my break up with T, I met another guy named S. I met him as I was third wheeling a date with one of my best friends. He was brought as company. I quickly told him I was unavailable, and S asked about my relationship with T and what it was like. I told him about how I was feeling and just the day to day things about the relationship throughout the night. He looked at him with concern, and sometimes, he looked as if he was just thinking. He ended up dropping me off at home, but then he stopped to talk to me in his car before he left. S told me how things weren't right and begged me to rethink things. He said that he would try to sweep me off my feet and that he would make me feel so good. In this moment, I thought he was talking about making me feel like a princess. I declined his offer but was happy to have someone listen to me that wasn't T.(Foreshadowing) I left his car and said thanks for being a good friend. Then, the next week I broke up with T because his roommate asked to speak with me and admitted that he was disgusted at how T treated me. They were good friends, but he said that he remembered vividly waking up to the sounds of my sobs loudly coming out of T's ""sound absorbing"" headphones. Instead of T actively comforting me, he was giving me short ""yeah"" ""okay"" answers as he was playing his computer games. My Skype video was visible in the corner of his screen, and there I was sobbing. His roommate admitted to T confessing that he thought my depression and anxiety was a sham. This was the line I drew. I promptly broke up with him because I was at my breaking point already at that point. I didn't want to start another year of my life being in pain like I was before. 

That summer already my uncle had died, and my grandmother's Alzheimer's progressed to her not being able to recognize me and grow to be quite mean to me. I started to go out more clubbing each weekend with the wrong crowd, S included. S spent his time flirting with me, casually touching me, and talking to me. Eventually, we were hanging out at his place alone and then we started to make out. From there, he started to move things forward. He mentioned sex, and I refused. Then, he started to say that he could make me forget T and make me feel so good. I still refused. He kept trying to coerce me, persuade me, and touch me. I kept saying no until finally, I was just tired and wanted to forget things. I was depressed and felt like nothing. So like that, he took my virginity. I felt so uncomfortable afterwards. This happened almost exactly the same for a second time. About a week passed, and I found out from friends in the wrong crowd that S had been going around telling everyone I was his side hoe and that all you had to do was call me cute or pretty, and my legs would open write up. I had a full mental breakdown and had every motive to want to attempt suicide at that moment, but since I was with friends, they prevented me from doing anything drastic at that moment. I later tried to starve myself to death, but then I read an article about how suicidal people don't really want to commit suicide, but, instead, it just took one thing to push them over the edge. This led me to being hospitalized for 3 weeks in an adolscent outpatient program. I didn't go to school or anything during those 3 weeks except for the hospital. Shortly after I got out, my grandmother passed away, and I haven't been the same since. 

My depression and anxiety has slowly gotten worse. I tried to starve myself to death again for my second attempt and was very recently admitted into inpatient psychiatric care (I am out now) for suicidal ideation and being reasy to do something more drastic. It was only a couple months ago did I come to understand I was sexually abused and assaulted. I also have identified  with the help of counselors and doctors in my recent hospitalization that a lot of my current problems with depression, anxiety, blaming myself for everything, and feeling guilty stem from the abuse I suffered.

Today, I felt good. I am trying to think of ways to cope and how to make my life better. I recently also just had been broken up with by my now-ex, but I can assure you all that it was all fond memories. He is my best friend. He never neglected me or ever made me feel guilty. If I said no, he immediately stopped. He held me and made me feel safe. I was able to be myself and feel happy even though everything around me was consuming me. I now know what a good relationship is and am glad to know that him, and I will continue forth being best friends at the very least. I secretly hope to get back together with him, but for now, I am focusing on learning to love myself and dealing with my mental health. I am looking forward to life in the future. Although, I am still very traumatized. I am happy to say that I am happy to be alive and that I wouldn't be here without the few people, who were there to support me when I needed it.",beepboopneepnoop,2019-03-08 22:22:33,1,2031,30.56,44.72,73.49,21.24,15.74,14.48,93.85,60.96,22.06,17.48,10.88,0.49,0.39,5.42,0.3,4.58,3.2,15.31,8.42,6.4,8.32,1.38,18.41,5.07,3.45,1.08,1.18,1.87,6.15,2.9,3.2,1.03,0.59,0.84,13.59,0.44,0.98,0.25,5.66,11.57,2.46,1.53,2.36,2.26,1.23,3.45,3.2,0.94,1.08,1.08,1.92,0.3,0.59,0.74,0.2,8.22,3,1.18,2.07,1.87,0.69,9.16,6.11,0.94,15.76,1.77,6.75,7.73,0.94,1.03,0.69,0.15,0.15,0.39,0.39,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.05,0,13.49,6.35,4.58,0.1,0,0,0,0.1,0.59,1.08,0.59,0.1
az12xo,"Hey, I have a question...","Sorry didn’t mean for this to be this long.

Hey, I don’t know if this belongs on this subreddit but if it doesn’t I’m sorry for wasting your time, I’m using a secondary account to post this as I am scared to use my primary one. I have always grown up in a home filled with yelling and hitting and sadness. The smallest I can remember being hit was when we lived in Mexico I remember I had turned 5 or 6 and I was carrying a big ceramic plate and I dropped it, shattering it, I don’t remember how things played out but I remember it hurting to sit down in my little pre k or kindergarten, and I lied saying I had fell off a tree and landed on my butt. When we moved over to the US it got better for a little while, I would still get yelled at but since we lived with family the hitting stopped. I remember this time as the happiest time of my life, my dad who we moved to America for me to meet never came in the picture, but a man who was a true angel took me under his wing as his own son, taking me out for ice cream, playing catch with me, and maybe sometimes lecturing me when I did something wrong, after 2 years of knowing him he was diagnosed with cancer and passed away, I remember that day was the saddest of my life, the light of my world had been put out for no reason I was angry at everything and I missed school for a day or two, when I came back to school more things broke down my “girlfriend” we had never agreed that’s what she was and what I was but it was pretty clear that’s how we treated each other was cheating on me with my best friend. They both cut me out of they’re life’s. My mom managed to get a house after that and it escalated again, VERY quickly. The hits came back she would slap me or just whip me with a belt and if I even whimpered it was another one (basically I couldn’t react to the force of a leather belt smacking my ass. Then she would slap me, one time on our ways to a family members home, I don’t remember what happened she slap me in the car and my nose started bleeding, she told me if I told them, I would get it worst at home so I kept my mouth shut. I haven’t spoken about it to this day. Recently she has started calling me names like saying I’m retarded, worthless, or a waste of human life. She has also told me something that really hurt she did and I quote “your the worst son anybody could ever ask for I don’t know why I didn’t abort you like your 3 older siblings” I had no idea that I had siblings that were aborted so that really hurt me she also broke a ceramic handle thing on my chin by hitting me with it, leaving a nasty mark for awhile and all I could tell the people who asked was I fell off my skateboard. I just feel like anyone who tries to love me pushes me away, and the one person who succeeded died and this makes me feel horrible. I really don’t know if this situation is abuse or of this is just how things normally are in a family, thank you for reading this and I’m sorry again if this is the wrong subreddit.",Ze-Meme-Finesser,2019-03-08 23:41:38,2,612,19.79,28.91,91.1,3.67,38.25,12.09,92.48,62.09,25,16.83,12.25,1.31,0.82,2.12,0.33,8.17,5.07,12.25,9.31,5.23,8.33,2.29,20.42,4.74,2.78,2.61,1.47,0.82,6.21,1.96,4.25,0.33,1.14,1.96,11.27,1.47,0.33,1.63,1.31,12.25,2.94,1.8,2.29,3.27,1.31,3.92,2.45,0.49,0.82,0.98,2.29,0.82,1.31,0,0.16,7.35,3.1,0.82,1.8,1.47,0.82,10.29,6.86,0.16,14.38,2.78,6.37,5.56,0.98,0.98,1.14,0.16,0.16,0.16,0.98,0.49,0.16,0.16,0,0,10.95,2.94,4.25,0,0,0,0,0,0.65,2.94,0.16,0
az4cau,Psychological warfare from YouTube that has spun into a man owning me,"I’m new here on reddit and was told to come here for help and to share my story. I will apologize for the length but this has gone on about 7 years now and it’s every single day so I can’t add everything and what I do add may be rather a said long but I’ll try my best to sum up some of it’s begging by and some new bigger instances...

So you wouldn’t think you could get a psychotic individual grasping on to your entire waking life from simple YouTube comments right? Cyberstalking when you look at it it happens usually on dating apps,trolls on Facebook, and other social platforms like twitter and snap chat insta ya know well accept for the very minute few on YouTube like for example Paranormal Ana and just a few others who disappeared  and that their last videos and posts related to stalker material and no one knows what happened to them...Well I guess I would have to fit into this teenie tiny small little category. Yes, I made videos and the funnier ones at times and they made oh about 63k views. Other than that your typical gaming videos Zumba which had quite a few followers as I was pretty damn good at this one track...ha ha I used to love many things...anyhow..Well yeah that’s enough about that as in my current state ...now, that’s a distant memory and forever loved and very much missed past time. I don’t know how to just jump right into this train wreck known of as my life now as there is sooooo much more that has gone on in the course of almost 7 years. So I will try my best to sum up the story but it will lack great and many important details due to the length of time and that it’s happening every day which I didn’t know in the start. Sooooo.. once finished AMA me...I’ve got so much more to say...

So, It began on YouTube where yes, at the time I was making YouTube videos on my personal channel also had many things and cultures i was into on YouTube, doesn’t everyone? However I’m on YouTube one day and the guy now known as what the police call “The Linux Voyuer” messaged me of course on googles very own platform...google hangouts (which I didn’t use but was advised by community members to do so to talk with various members of the YouTube community). We began talking quite a bit and i was trying to get him hooked up with my other friend I’ll call him Todd. He’s important in this story too so are various other but due to length this all will have to wait it’s turn. Todd my buddy advised me even begging at times saying PLEASE STOP TALKING TO THAT GUY! He used to get so angry with me...now..I wish I would of listened, however you see I am the type of girl who gives everyone a chance and I am not quick to judge even if I’m not fibulae with their let’s say interests or topics they speak of that’s just never been me since a being a kid. Once as a kid I almost ran off with a biker...my mother caught me as I was asking can I come over to your house and play...I still here this story from my parents today and it’s quite a reminder of why I really need to stop giving just anyone my trust....at this point if I could go back I wish as a kid I would have drove off on a Harley into the night it couldn’t be half as bad as what this guy has done to me...so yea just think about that for a moment....life....anyways...I’m getting off course just trying to explain how he probably got as much info as he needed to do what he has done and continues to this very minute I fact he’s probably watching me or god knows what deviant behavior. He’s a nasty old man you see. So yea...

One day he messaged me along with two of his other friends which I did not know very well and was weary but thought you know no big deal they are just a group of friends enjoying the same things. That decision was the biggest MISTAKE of my known LIFE ever. Dramatic I know right it seems as such but it was... remember this is just like two or three incidents and remember I told you he does it everyday for almost 7 years...that’s a lot of instances and occurrences that just can’t all be simply put here... anyways..
I started noticing technological things like crazy and at first I was like it’s just broken or made up some dumb excuse for why things were shutting off and/or turning on by themselves.  So yeah basically My router began turning off by itself constantly and at one period dos attacks 77 times in a row. Now at this point I know I’m not crazy but the shit is making me crazy as it takes all WiFi down and if you have WiFi cams speakers lights etc...it’s not a joke anymore...and this is just the tiniest tip of the huge glacier of a iceberg. Right so Wifi Ddos is not just it. This psycho obsessive freak got my phone number (and much much more..details in ama) and called and said some pretty gross shit including murder rape and desecration of my body he also decided to give my 65 year old mother the same call too oh how nice of him to reach out to my family right let’s call an elderly and tell her we’re going to rape her kill her and please ourself with necrophiliacs afterwords and the plans after that well he left those plans wide open to thought..... This seems like the worst it could get right? Ha sigh.. well no sadly I wish this was the ending to my unsolved story so It doesn’t stop there. It so much worse than that.
For example....
In October of 2018 my fiancé bought me an item from Walmart that I simply just didn’t like and since I was going there to get your usual coffee bag and some cream I stopped off at the return desk. I go to return the goods and the cash machine made this awful noise that I’ve literally never heard a cash register do the lady turned the little too screen around and it’s effing red? They do that??...she the cashier walked outside of the desk and firmly by my top grabbed and brought me to their back room. At this point im really uneasy and so on edge and have no clue wtf is going on. Well within about 7 minutes or so A real police officer arrives. I start crying and I’m clueless at what could be happening aside from the embarrassment I was with my mother! 
The police officer slaps on cuffs and tells me I’m going to jail for theft and some other crimes I’ve never heard of and Since the theft was so much it was considered some kind of operation and that I had 99 counts of it within two days time. I said can we wait a minute I’ll empty everything I have in my purse I have stolen nothing. The officer told me no not here that we know of yet did you steal anything,....but don’t worry we will search you and definitely check your bags and your purse at the station. He said your “theft ring” (WTF) is In various other places ma’am There are about 80 to 90 stores in fact that under your name and signature and ID have confirmed giving cash back for later found stolen goods. Really now WTF!! I’m like sir I’ve not been to any other states recently I said can you tell me what this is detailing or in reference to?! Side note Might I add I was sobbing and horrified so effing confused I really was lost and felt a hole inside of myself asking how could this effing be. He said ma’am you went to several stores in different towns in different states and returned goods you stole from other Walmart’s for cash, he’s states are you that dumb to not think Walmart does not monitor this kind of stuff? I was shocked. I was like can I see the transactions at least so I know what I didn’t do and steal supposedly?? So the cashier lady willing printed it off for me  and held it to show me as my arms were behind my back and he already had one but wouldn’t give it to me to look at. He allowed the lady to though for some reason. I said sir it would be physically impossible for me to do 99 returns in the time of what looked like 2 days. I said also those are store numbers right?? I asked Where are those store numbers located even. He said good question. So did the manger cashier lady thing...ugh.. bloody hell ...at this point I figure I’m better if pissing up a rope...

Well after he left room he went to find out actually where these transactions were taking place. I sat for quite a while sobbing and thinking wtf is happening here I know I haven’t left town and I certainly wouldn’t be a dumbass and steal anything and try to return it to the store who even does that shhh!? At one point I even started to get angry because I know I didn’t do that and how tf could anyone let alone tiny little ol me do 99 effing returns in two days!! I don’t own a jet certainly not a speed racing car..and my motorcycle is a 650cc ...99 returns at about 80 to 90 stores in various states...Isn’t that impossible...seriously it has to be...impressive for whom actually did it come to find out..

ok so yea Welp the time went on and on and finally in he entered this tiny little idk what it was storage room (which gave me issues because I hate dirt and confined spaces) ...he un-cuffed my arms btw  side note this moment I felt well almost was like a high or something euphoria maybe because of how upset I was and confused the whole bit but I felt myself almost blackout and the stress literally came out of my body through my feet (another side note I’m on anxiety meds already and wasn’t able to take one during that time they had my purse with them in it and I was cuffed). He said I’m uncuffing you ma’am but you have a serious issue on your hands. He said we did a gps location search of the stores and from the time date and location it would be physically impossible for you to have done this and be here in this location at this time of morning. And as he’s uncuffing me he told me I have a huge mess on my hands and that I needed to contact Walmart Corporate and the fraud division. The Walmart lady explained ma’am they could only get cash back with a valid ID or drivers license. So...this brings me to another portion of my large almost 7 year stalker story. This is still just a tiny bit of it...

Long before this crazy Walmart shit happened I tied the ends together and I was thinking oh my god a telemarketer must have done this. Recorded me saying hello or my name on voicemail and went on to get info...This is me always making excuses for the stalkers evil shit he does to me because I thought I seriously was going crazy. Well I wasn’t crazy after remembering what this man (he’s effing 41) had done previously. So no Not exactly a damn telemarketer.  

I keep playing in my head the advice: Stop making excuses bloody hell all the pieces fit and your being a bloody moron always saying it’s someone else because you’re to scared or to worried that you could really have a crazy psychotic stalker...but I kept doing this making excuses for everything until I just couldn’t anymore my excuses were getting terribly ridiculous and they weren’t adding up the excuses made me sound crazy at this point..hell all of it is crazy this was just effing YouTube...anyhow but him his ties into every bit like a puzzle piece fits it’s puzzle ...the stalker did not sound as crazy...having a stalker is crazy in itself though so, call it as u wish I can deal with regular crazy hell yea I’ll stick with that then. Moving on...

So, as I did my detective work prior to this happening I googled my user name and aliases and found several profiles that I didn’t make. One being a slightly softer porn sight where there were pictures of me sexually. Nude full nude. Chest girly parts the whole bit. These pictures were stolen. Used without my consent. They were on my security storage on my cell for my fiancé. I was mortified at all I found. I remember earlier when finding them in order to have my naked bod taken down off the site, the sites “owner” said you have to send a valid ID confirming it’s you in order for them to be removed. I didn’t want to do that but I did what other option did I have. BOoddyyyy IDIOT! It all hit me then about the Walmart scheme they had my effing DRIVERS LICENSE/PICTURE ID and got it effing counterfeited. He has many cult girls that could just go in and do that shit with my id that’s fake. Idk Walmart probably doesn’t even look at the damn picture or nothing...who knows...but they got away with the shit...anyways in and on we go....ohhhh the rabbit hole...

So many other things going on such as I soon then started receiving phone calls spoofed numbers my number being spoofed. Not your normal robocall’s these calls were from Russia France Spain Canada...Netherlands...I even call recorded shit that was being said...by some guy named “Louis”... until an officer here actually called him and told him to stop calling me and if he didn’t he would be charged for harassment. I also visited that creepy guy on google hangouts ...you know the now known guy who wanted to speak with Todd now known as my owner or stalker from YouTube/google hangouts that I stopped talking to a while long long while ago because he himself self confessed to me some disturbing shit... for example he’s a satanist (and I don’t hate on anyone’s religious beliefs but it just wasn’t for me at that time) also it spun into other things he told me like he has what is known as a god complex and is a real mental disorder...he also explained he was a paranoid..sucks blood and his mother I’ll call her Mrs. P is a vampire I guess.  At like 60  or more years of age? Wtf...WOAH...and the circus goes on and on.

So when he found out I was really sort of scared at him by viewing his writings on tumblr saying “do you think a murder could really happen during an arg”and seeing the graphic images he posted of murder rape forced sado machoism necrophilia women nude with blood on them with the writing SLUT and also his fake email has necro in it I just had to end the cycle of this man speaking to me. I mean common Wouldn’t you?? 

After all this and the many other things he’s done which honestly if I wrote them, all of this shit this would be a book which right now I am already feeling like it is already as I type and really these are just tiny things of the mass of destruction he’s caused.  Like I am a prisoner inside my own home folks...So yea I’m thinking maybe I should write one because let me tell you 7 years of a deep web cyber stalker there’s a lot to tell with so much more detail because it is literally every single day he’s here in my life and I am his property. It’s every single day...who does this shit??

Anyways I went to his you tube and I found threatening videos directed right to me he even spelled my name in one of them in a craft section at a go figure Walmart you know those wood letters you can paint he arranged them into my name. There were several others with satanic messages which of course I don’t understand but human skulls and probably spells idk what satanist do and how they do it all I know is I put 2 and 2 together. 

At this point I head on started assuming this to many of my friends associates and followers around the community even his creepster ass ....he even knew I was accusing him and damn well right he’s making videos that are graphic in nature to me because they were sent out for me &amp; no one else would see it that way. The clues were subtle to anyone else. Just recently 2019, I logged in to turn in my student taxes and am noticed by turbo tax a sbcglobal (I dont have one) claimed 2k lastly year from a non exsisting college under my name. I call them and they explain fraud...oh man I’m gonna loose my shit here....how do I protect myself he’s doing crazy ass shit just crazy and bold af....Well all the while I live in a protected reserve village and if you call the police station u get an answering machine if you’re burglarized you may see an officer next week. 

So I’ve reported all this stuff and I do have the Sargent personal cell number. Nothing is being done. I even have like a 25 min phone call recording to the fbi. I put this on YouTube and when he finally found it he removed all video content pertaining to violence or satanism toward me.what he doesn’t know is I have his real name his address his moms name and a storage unit full of evidence including video screen records of these videos he hid ( he wouldn’t delete them they are like trophy’s oh wait did I forget to mention he keeps all my photos and had the balls to say it to me..wtf!!) and so much more where he has left digital footprints where he forgot to erase his tracks or use a vpn. 

I’m not trying to go back and fourth here it’s just hard to explain it all but we moved to this reserve because someone came to our home at about 3:24 am banging on the windows walls doors screaming gibberish. The person wouldn’t stop this Carries in 5-6 minutes my dumb self thinking eventually who’s doing it will indeed stop. Well it didn’t stop. I woke my fiancé shaking like a wet chihuahua in the snow and he got up and gets one of his finest butchering knifes. My fiancé answers the door half nude and the dude was still speaking gibberish. I have several masters degrees and I speak a few languages fluently. He was not speaking Spanish he was not speaking Arabic and he was not speaking Chinese or Catonise. I honestly think he was saying some satanic shit it sounded that way. So anyways at this point he took off running afterword. We couldn’t see him it was dark and he was on the sidewalk not the porch when he opened the door black hoodie black pants hoodie up still rambling weird shit. My fiancé won’t call the cops he’s one of those guys. I mean he’s huge 6’4” about 310 lbs. He doesn’t like the police prime factor probably pot use idk. In the earlier hours of the am I get up around 8 and the dog needs out to potty so I walk him I arrive back from around the block to see our screen had been cut open. But after that happened at our home this is one of the earlier instances in the beginning of all this bullshit havoc the stalker has created we moved ...thinking we’d be more protected here in our “protected” village of our heritages. That’s a joke seriously...That’s totally wrong though it’s way worse there’s no protection. Aside from the cops coming past my house about 4 times a day now on a daily checkup. 

So right now we’re in the forensic process of evidence. Also I have had to see a psychiatrist who has diagnosed me with severe ptsd anxiety agoraphobia and even suicidal thoughts. So, this is just a tiny portion of my life of being cyber stalked by a complete psychopath. I really want to catch him. I’ve even spoken to the police in his town I also know where he works and his hidden emails and his two girly friends full names. However,  jurisdictional law prevents this detective from actually nabbing him but he’s watching him to try to catch him up there in his town. I pray everyday that he does catch him and then we can slam all the rest he’s done to destroy me and my life. As I stated right now we are in the IT forensic part of the investigation with my PI and lawyers and Sargent and the FBI and IRS. I know this reddit community has some pretty good detectives as well...hoping one may contact me... as I said AMA (ask me anything) 

Yep, so long story short I’m his property he owns me and I am a prisoner in my very own home...my existence is null and sometimes I give into those thoughts of being pain free and unafraid....Of course I have arms  or what the youngsters call “strapped” (and really merely for protection from him) and sometimes it’s tempting but I’ve never done it...however when he pushes me over the line some days I do think of it heavily...as I stated he does this every single day he either doses my router turns off my cell data calls and calls and calls spoofing my number...if I’m in my car using my Bluetooth he can make the music stop with this ear piercing sound that could get anyone into an accident...it’s everyday....I need help...if not soon because it’s been 7 years almost I may wind up getting what he ultimately wants without the satisfaction of him actually doing it himself to me...then he wouldn’t get what he wants anymore..or maybe that is what he wants...really I don’t know anymore....so there’s just a tiny little bit of an every day real life cyber stalking story...share it if you know anyone who knows how to handle this type of problem...he is using tor also as I sometimes watch those deepweb challenges or deep web surveillance...one day I found he stole my video and put it online on tor and then this other user brought it to YouTube...it’s a bunny...the rabbit holeeee..oh my god...so..

I’ve done ic3.gov hotlines police lawyers I have them working with me it’s just not coming to a head and I really need it to for my sanity. I am not who I use to be a creative fun loving happy girl I’m someone else he’s created and it’s a scary thing to be who I am today. If only he was caught I could maybe one day recover....but I’m not seeing that....so there you have it much more other details just didn’t want to overload the situation...this guy is a psychopathic voyeur monster....bottom line my fellow tubers a warning be careful on YouTube my friends...you could become someone’s personal private property....and it could end in torture rape murder and necrophilia from how he would put it bluntly enough anyway..don’t say you were never warned about the rabbit and his hole of never ending personal hell...beware of YouTube my friends..be damn aware....

You can call me The butchers baby...and you may AMA honestly I’d be pleased to get some of it off my chest.... and if you want more I can continue with a part two but as this already long enough I felt I need to stop while my good foot was ahead...",Bu7ch3rB4by,2019-03-09 07:04:08,0,4177,24.85,43.53,64.61,9.35,28.81,13.96,90.11,57.7,20.49,13.38,7.92,0.5,1.24,3.02,0.69,7.11,4.72,12.02,9.79,6.82,7.97,2.11,18.46,4.19,2.25,1.56,1.68,2.56,4.91,1.72,3.06,0.43,1.29,0.22,11.59,0.22,0.55,0.6,3.3,12.23,2.49,1.34,1.8,2.94,1.34,3.62,2.78,1.24,1.17,0.34,1.7,1.03,0.41,0.29,0.05,6.2,1.44,0.62,2.42,1.13,0.81,5.96,10.01,1.15,14.03,1.68,7.11,5.36,0.98,1.15,0.38,0.53,0.43,0.17,2.82,1.32,0.79,0.29,0.55,0.26,16.14,10.56,0.43,0.05,0.02,0.43,0.26,0.05,0.36,3.35,0.53,0.1
az57wl,Pain and blathering,"Im the stupid one. The mentally unstable one. The disabled one. The one who isnt gonna get anywhere in life. Im the trans one, the one with all the chronic issues and medical shit. The worthless one, the defiant one. The one who gets laughed at for wanting to get away from their abuse that they don't think is happening. 

Hes the smart one. The favourite. The healthy one. The one who is gonna get a degree in architecture and go somewhere in life. The quiet obedient one. The one who stays in his room all day and doesnt bother anyone. The one they clearly like more than me, who they give special treatment. They are willing to pay for his medical stuff. I love him. Im not jealous, I'm glad hes treated better. He doesn't deserve what theyre doing to me. 

Theyre the ones who dont care about me. The ones who treat me like a servant, like im less than human. Like im just here to do their bidding. The one who pretends that she loves me, but doesnt any more, just like I feared as a child. And the one who came into my life halfway through and pretended to care about me for a month untill he realized how much he hated me. 

The little ones who havent formed an opinion on them yet. The ones who still love their dad. The ones who can just barely understand that theyre treating me poorly, and only me. The ones that don't deserve to live the same way i did, and i pray they will treat them better when im gone. I love them too. 

Im tired. I keep having thoughts of wanting to die, but i know I don't really want to die, i just want the situation to be over. I just want to feel safe for once in my life. I cant take this anymore.

az5ugv,I Almost Got Sent to Juvy,"My father has always  been a neglectful parent. He is abusive but it's not always quite an active thing, but it is still there. My mom never had money to leave him and that's why I'm still here, which is ""lovely."" He's never shown any care for us (me + my older brother and sister) or anything. I know some people aren't that verbal when it comes to love, but we never heard an I love you from him once in our entire lives. He never tried to do things with us or for us, never talked to us, never disciplined us like a father would. He would always just lay in bed all day and only acknowledge us if it was to tell us to move out of the way of the TV. He tried to starve my older sister on  a multitude of occasions. He has hurt her physically more than my brother and me. He has hurt my mother. 

Anyway, this story took place in seventh grade. It was spring. My mother was annoyed that he did not take the trash. She went on how she would refuse to make dinner for him unless he took the trash. {Note: we live outside of town. Taking out the trash does not mean putting it at the end of our driveway, it means taking it all the way to the dump. The trash was always overflowing because he would never take it.} My mother didn't stick to this though, she made him a can of beans. He went downstairs with it {we never ate at our dining table, but in the family room} and I followed. I  just stood against the wall, lile across from the chair he was in. He got paranoid my mother did something to the food. 

My mother came down, was mad he was refusing to eat the beans. He went upstairs and opened a NEW can of beans which made her more mad. 

At this point I was done with them. I decided to go back upstairs. 

Somehow walking past him lead to me and him wresting over a can of beans, I think he reacted weirdly and tried to kick me. 

The beans spilled over me. I ended up backing up to the other side of the room. He stood up and pushed me and swung at me and started charging at me. 

Perspective on this, he was an extremely obese tall man and I was tall, but very frail and skinny  (and anorexic at the time as well) with very weak anything. I couldn't kick hard or punch hard or anything and I was not strong in the slightest to stop him. 

But I did have sharp nails. 

I grabbed his neck and scratched him, because it was the only way to stop him and I wasn't going to take it. 

My mom was quick to stand up but everything was very fast and weird in seconds. 

Me and my mom left the house, first telling his parents what happened {they lived next door, which is why we couldn't kick him out as he would just still be stalking us}. Then mom drove back to the house and got my stuffed animal for me and I think her clothes.  I love stuffed animals. 

We went to her parents house. 

The next day, we went to the police as my sister {a probation officer} was very strongly advocating for it. 

Arrived at the station. Weirdly no one was there. But we called for someone to arrive there. 

Deputy Carter comes back maybe an hour later. 

We tell him what happened. I kept referencing that this kind of thing *has happened before.* 

Deputy Carter writes stuff down, asks more questions, etc. 

He then goes to another part of the station for another 40 minutes and comes back out. 

My mom wanted the police to at least go out of there to *talk to him* about how it was wrong to do that. She wasn't sure about pressing any charges or yada dada but she thought if the police told him off about it seriously that he may think again before doing something. 

However, what came next was shocking. 

Deputy Carter: if we even came out there to talk to him, we would have to arrest your daughter. 

Mom: What? 

Deputy Carter: If he said she attacked him, we would arrest her and not him.

Basically, they would take his word over mine. 

Me: because I defended myself? 

Deputy Carter: yes {Basically} 

So we left the station in shock with the fact THAT I WOULD GET SENT TO JUVY!!!  My sister had a fit over that how that was very wrong. 

And here I am still stuck at this shitty place. 

Because i would have been sent to juvy instead of actual justice.

az7nsj,My siblings disguise themselves as very articulate and stable people but are covert abusers? i need guidance.,"I just wanted to say that i am here to not feel judged or ashamed, i have acquired trauma from the mistreatment i received on groups when asking for support, i was shunned as some type of monster, many times the responses left me feeling dreadful and suicidal as well as homicidal, so all i ask is please do show empathy, and i think a small portion here might also have the same disorder as me.

i have Borderline personality Disorder and Narcissistic personality (NOS), Opposition defiant traits, mild intellectual impairment, among a couple anxiety disorders.

To start this, i acknowledge with responsibility that sometimes i may have instigated the conflicts, this is an extremely hard thing for others to admit but i have nothing to lose admitting it. however many times i have been a victim of gaslighting at the hands of my two brothers, these people have destroyed my life and i think that they are the environmental cause of my BPD however no matter what i say to them it was somehow my destiny to have BPD because well ''genetics''. 

my older bro recently like an hour ago took shots at me for napping and disguised it as joke, he tried to say indirectly that i was ''65 years old'' and than somehow suggested my sleeping is not normal when he has an even worse sleeping pattern than mine, and when i reacted and told him that it wasn't the right way to bond with someone and to instead ask about my day, he immediately replied by saying ''you really should calm down'' and from there he was just saying how my thinking is not clear and how distorted it is, when i confronted him he again tried to make it out like i am the crazy one. he has done things like this in the past, where he blatantly tries to control what i do in a covert way and always has some criticism for everything I DO, when i showed him the benefits of siesta napping, he than said ''you are not from europe'', again changing the subject to cause further conflict and in the end to make it seem it is me who is crazy. i really think i am a victim of emotional covert abuse, but i feel bad for even thinking that they may be the problem because no matter what i do i secretly think that it was somehow me who overreacted, it's really crazy.

azab0v,I completely and wholeheartedly despise my brother.,"Apologies in advance since this is a very, very long post. If there is a more appropriate place to post this, please do tell me! I am completely new to reddit and this is my first post, but I thought abuse would be okay.

If I was to list every scumbag, awful thing my brother has done, this post would probably take a good few hours to read. But, I suppose I'm here to vent about my genuine hatred for my brother and hopefully this post can act as a place for people to share their own experiences with having a sibling from hell.

My brother is currently 24 and male, and I am 17 and female. When I was younger, I sympathised with my brother a lot due to our, at the time, relatively good relationship, and because I had a bad relationship with my mum. This was also likely partly attributed to my age and overall naivety as well as the fact he had yet to do much directly *to me.* But over the years my brother has managed to teach me that it is in fact entirely possible to hate someone regardless of being from the same parent.

I won't go too into detail about the hellish things my brother caused me and my family to witness when I was younger as I don't think they contribute too much, but I will simply say a lot of the things that did happen traumatised me and were likely the root of my extremely bad mental health which I had from an extremely young age. I mean, social services were very heavily involved with our family from a young age and my mum would have to lie to them about a lot of things to avoid having me taken from her care (which some of you might criticise, but I appreciate the fact she did this immensely since I would have hated not growing up with her even if we have not always had a brilliant relationship, and she shielded me incredibly well from a lot of the stuff that was happening).

But, onto present day. My brother is a manipulative, conniving, a-hole. And he has a belief that he is entitled to absolutely everything. A perfect example of this was when he bought me xbox games for Christmas. Looking back on it now, I feel it was a deliberate decision he bought physical copies of the games, and not so that I could open them on Christmas day. No, it's because he would frequently steal MY games that he GIFTED TO ME and sell them at CEX or something to go buy his fucking weed. He still has not replaced a lot of them. And want to know what his sick justification for it was? ""I bought them."" Even though they weren't FUCKING HIS. He also stole my controller, but at least replaced that with a cute minecraft pig one. He has honestly stolen a lot of things for money, which is just one of the plethora of reasons that I hate him, but at least xbox games and controllers can be replaced. He also has stolen his gold baptism jewellery which was gifted to him by our dead grandfather, and my mum was beyond distraught - not because it was gold, but because it was from her dead dad!  
I mean, once I had a coin container that was specifically made in a way that could not be opened without breaking it, and my dad would put money in it for me to save up gradually and take it out when it was full (note: my dad is not my brother's biological father) and my brother literally stuck a knife in it and managed to take all the paper notes out...my dad stopped giving me physical money after that purely because my brother could not be trusted.

And he's stolen *a lot* of other things, I'm just scratching the surface here...

Continuing with the theme of entitlement, all of the posters and things on my brother's wall are all my old anime posters. The only reason I don't make a fuss is because I wouldn't put them up now, but he never asked. He also thinks it's okay to take my trainers and wear them whenever wanted WITHOUT ASKING. He has no consideration for anyone but himself. He still lives in our house because he's awful with money despite having a full-time job and constantly asks her for money and always owes it to her. He also owes my dad money, as well as having multiple continuous debts at the moment (which he refuses to open the letters for, I would not be suprised if baylifts came over soon), but I digress. Because he lives here, he expects lifts from my mum constantly. My mum will frequently have her evenings ruined because she has to pick him up from his job anywhere between 8 and 10:30, and if god forbid she ever makes plans on the weekend and can't drive him then he threatens to not pay his rent that month or give her any of the money he owes her. As though it's her fault that he can't get to work. He's the one that literally left his motorbike at a friend's house (that my dad paid for) and left it at a friend's house and never went to pick it up. Yep. *That's how he lost his fucking vehicle.* It was slightly broken, but he even got a loan of £500 to get it fixed and blew the money on other stuff!

He is extremely irresponsible. Despite all his debts, he just keeps spending all his money on other things he can't afford.

AAAND now that we move away from just general asshat behaviour (I could have said so much more but this is already turning into an essay) and onto how he is abusive and manipulative. Things can spiral into an argument very easily with my brother. He is extremely defensive, standoff-ish and is pretty much never the problem in any situation ever in his view. Most siblings if arguing will just have a normal shouting argument, but apparently I am never allowed to raise my voice to my brother, because that gives him authority to grab my face extremely tight, slap me or punch me. Once a few months ago he strangled me which left bruises on my neck for days, as well as slammed me to the ground and I can't even remember the specifics of it but that bit behind my knee also ended up bruised. And what for? Me actually standing up for myself when he went to grab my face and scratching the fuck out of his arm. The only reason he didn't do worse damage is because my mum was in the middle of it all. My brother is a lot stronger than me, although I am taller, so it's impossible to get him off and I am not a very physical person either. I'd say the physical abuse was the worst when I was around 14/15, maybe 16, since I would flinch when anyone in school touched me or even raised their hands in my direction in a non-threatening way. It would genuinely make my chest tighten and I felt like I could not breathe and I was extremely starved of physical connection and affection during this period. I would have frequent breakdowns during school.

He also will call me with names a lot and has throughout my entire teenage years, such as: stupid bitch, stupid little girl, idiot, cow, brat, selfish bitch, annoying, ugly, etc. Often these insults are also accompanied with threats of violence. Once when I was in the car with my mum, I told him how he is NOT entitled to my mum picking him up and he told me to shut up or he would throw his water bottle at my head. I mean, what the hell? He's seriously fucked up.

The physical abuse is no where near as frequent since I'm rarely at home anymore (long story), which has made my mental health improve massively, but I hate the fact he makes me feel uncomfortable in my own home. I only feel truly comfortable there when he is not there. He has this constant angry energy that just puts me on edge, and he'll do things like slam doors unecessarily or shout which will cause my anxiety to flare up. He is not physically abusive to my mother, but he has called her every name under the sun, most of which are far more vulgar and aggressive than what he's called me (i.e. cunt). He has also been xenophobic (i don't know if i can say racist since we are all white) to my mum, calling her a stupid italian bitch and telling her to go back to her own country (we are from the U.K, but she is Italian and migrated here) which makes no fucking sense to me. That is the woman who birthed you, and you are Italian too. And she has done so much for him - far too much in my opinion - and he gets pissed off when she asks him to clean after himself or d his own damn laundry and ironing or cook for himself.

I feel as though I should probably finish this post here, but feel free to ask me any questions or anything. There isn't anything I'm not comfortable saying about the situation, I just obviously didn't want to make this post about 20 pages long.

**TL;DR** My brother is an entitled, asshole who steals from his own family and is physically and emotionally abusive to his sister and mum and I will be happy the day he is gone from my life. I genuinely don't think I'd react much if he died.",scaredfoxes,2019-03-09 16:50:50,0,1666,21.51,41.23,38.63,3.93,24.5,15.49,92.86,61.82,21.31,15.49,8.16,0.48,0.24,5.94,0.66,5.82,4.74,12.61,9.54,7.14,8.94,2.4,16.39,5.34,2.04,1.86,1.02,2.64,5.94,1.86,4.08,0.42,2.64,0.12,13.15,2.52,0.06,2.1,6.3,14.83,1.74,2.64,2.04,3.3,2.4,4.56,1.62,0.18,0.48,0.78,2.22,0.72,0.9,0.36,0.18,6.72,2.52,0.48,2.28,1.02,0.72,4.32,10.14,0.84,12.79,1.26,5.88,5.34,0.78,0.72,0.66,1.56,0.48,0.18,1.62,0.96,0.24,0.3,0.24,0,13.45,4.32,4.14,0.18,0.06,0.18,0.18,0.42,0.12,2.1,1.08,0.66

azf1rm,Several behaviours. (TW: abuse),"Taken from my post on r/raisedbyborderlines (I was banned shortly after) and my crosspost from r/mentalhealth (no one commented):

“I’m a regular on two of the JUSTNO subreddits and I’m always reading the posts here. It’s my first post here. Sorry if I’m in the wrong subreddit. 


My story: TL;DR drunk mum did massive verbal, mental, and (very rarely and not that bad) physical abuse - like actions. I ended up getting Baker Acted. Mum has attempted to improve but is still not good when drinking. 


I ‘m experiencing flashbacks / unwanted intrusive thoughts, have heightened emotional sensitivity, have repeatedly thought about suicide (actually tried to last week), disassociate, threaten to be violent, and have a hard time accepting kindness when it’s not expected. 

I’m especially worried about the first and the last one. For context, two passed me a note about how I was doing a good job. I downplayed the compliments, but thanked them. A friend also gave me reimbursement for food through insistence and I ended up internally screaming. 

Flashbacks consist of: me thinking I’m being chased, me seeing the scenes I was in, me thinking nonstop about events, me crying. You get the gist. 


Am I the only one experiencing this? 

Sorry if this is the wrong place.”

azhmv2,How &amp; When to Leave,"When your parent or parents or close people in your life have stopped becoming supportive (in any way be it financially, emotionally or socially) and have started to lie to you about their intentions and the results of their actions, prepare to leave.

They will get upset and may even get violent. Do not let them know that you are leaving without being a safe distance away from them, physically and emotionally and mentally.

If you ever get attacked in your home or where you live (at your parent's home) you need to get out of the immediate area into a well lit public place. Coffee shops, fast food restaurants, even walmart. Buy something small and bring all your money, phone, and whatever pets you have with you.

You cannot cure them and you cannot change them and they will not listen to reason.

If they have committed crimes involving you, you must report it (even if it doesn't get taken seriously) to the police or government.

You must notify people in your immediate social area of what they have done and what they are like.

Your work, school, landlord, etc.

Then continue to save money. You have to cut ties with anybody they have contact with that have an association with you. Do not feel bad or become sympathetic - they are aware of their ill intent but due to their irrational beliefs they think that they have a right to terrorize you in the name of 'family'. This is not what normal families do and they will not respond well.

Keep saving money. Keep pushing them away. Keep your distance. Get pets to help keep you sane.

Numerous people around me have displayed some possessive, obsessive, and belittling behavior toward me, from family to authority figures. In late December, I was woken up by my landlord and the sheriff, handcuffed and brought to the local hospital scared and confused, drugged against my will, and then my memory is conspicuously blank from leaving the first floor of the local hospital to arriving at the ward on a higher floor where I was then detained, despite specifically remembering the drugging and later the arrival at the ward. I have long been questioning this hospital's conduct, such as me being heavily medicated from the age of three up until going lukewarm turkey over the course of a few months in the middle of last year (why was it necessary to medicate a three-year-old for psychiatric purposes in the first place? Isn't that jumping the gun a bit?), and my old psychiatrist prescribing unnecessary medication to ""help me a little more"" and being otherwise loose with adding more/stronger medication and experimenting, while being extremely cautious about *lessening* the medication.

azqeu9,My wife is not what she seems,"For the reason of not allowing people to find out who I may be speaking of, this post lacks a bit of context, I care very much about everyone around me, and in no way am I seeking to out someone.

 My life has not been easy thus far. I married when I was 19 to someone that was very Ill, she eventually passed away. She suffered for 4 years, she died so young. I had been alone for years after, I had no one. I would go and sit at Starbucks, I took some type of social pleasure in just hearing someone call my name when I would order coffee. Just sitting around people made me feel less alone, although at the same time more alone than ever.

 I one day received a message from a family friend, she was very beautiful, and very caring of my situation. I had never spoken to this woman before. She seemed overly interested in me, and my past. Being alone for so long I found comfort in talking too her. Eventually my family found out that her and I had a interest in one another. My mother seemed a bit concerned, but at the time never said anything at the time. I became infatuated with this lady, and the care and interest she had in me. She was the kind of lady that everyone would notice if she walked into a room. Beautiful, she would brighten up the room. I could not believe that this was happening, things went from missery and depression and thoughts of suicide, to the actual hope for my future again. Months went by as we began to go on dates, and eventually we were officially dating. Almost the same time I began dating her is when she had a falling out with one of my family members, they were best friends. I was never told what actually happened, it never made any sense. But I took my girlfriends side in the matter as it seemed I was almost forced to. Shortly thereafter she began complaining when any of my family members would talk to me, call me or message me. I did not think it was a big deal as she recently ended that friendship with that family member.

  I began only hanging out with her and her mom. I went to dinner with her and her mother one night, we drove in her mom's car. I noticed the front passenger door of her car was almost ripped off it's hinges. When the door was opened the door would drop down almost hitting the ground. I asked her mom what had happened to the door? She gave me a surprised look and told me her daughter was upset (My girlfriend) and they were arguing with each other, and my girlfriend slammed the door to hard. I didn't have much of a response. The whole time I was wondering how the hinges we're broken so badly from slamming the door, it would seem like the door would have had to be pushed and forced the opposite way of the car to be that badly damaged. Later that night we were sitting at dinner, my girlfriend was very upset that her mom and I were talking. She would get quite and then yell at her mom. It was very cringy in the moment. Again, I didn't think much of it. Months went by, things were going great. 

I knew she was the one by comparison of what my life used to be like. I didn't think I would get another chance, I felt lucky. I was happy... happier than I had been in 5 years. After the proposal, my family started warning me of my fiancees attitude. They said that she has acted out in the past, that they have seen her hit her mom, and been raging mad. I confronted my fiancee about it, she said they were just trying to turn me against her, and they were making it all up so we would break up. She seemed to have a good point, I did feel a lot of push back from my parents and sister. I began distancing myself from my family. 

We eventually got married. My family was concerned, but they supported me. My family is very caring, they are amazing people that are super friendly, they deeply care about me and everyone they come into contact with. And I was a idiot for not caring for their opinion on the matter. They hoped for the best in my marriage. My wife would not allow me to talk to them, if I did she would go ballistic. She would call my sister a fake whore, my mom was a fake ass whore, and she seemed to be somewhat okay with my dad for whatever reason. She was actively trying to turn me against them. She hated my friends, and anyone that I knew that she didn't know. 

Sorry if things get graphic. 

I began to miss my family. I would talk to my mom, but I wouldn't tell her what was happening inside my marriage. My wife saw the phone calls and thought I was saying things to my mom behind her back. She would keep me up all night yelling at me, and finding reasons to be mad. Usually it would be that I wasn't willing to do the dishes at 3 in the morning. She would throw heavy objects at my head that would have severely hurt me or cracked my head open. I was able to avoid the things she would throw, other than her phone hitting me in the face beyond several times. We would go out places. I thought it would be better since she might not act out in public. She would grab the wheel out of my had and steer us into oncoming traffic, then begin to hit me in the head while I'm driving. I would pull over and try to get her out of the car, she would run in front of the car or open the door in time and try ripping the door off of the car... She would eventually calm down, or walk home. 

She would always bring up my family and make up things that never happened and accuse of telling my parents what she does to me, or saying I was flirting with a girl that I never even talked to. She would always get physical and start throwing things, or trying to punch me in the face. I would usually tackle her to the ground and just hold her from moving to stop the madness, she would scream at the top of her lungs and bite me, she would always dig her teeth in until blood was dripping from my arm into her mouth. I had countless bite marks all over my body.

I would not do what she was doing to me, I might be bigger, but I would not stoop down to that level. It would not have made things better for either one of us if I hit her. I was extremely embarrassed that this was happening, I was doing my best to fix it myself. I was always calm and tried to use reasoning to get her to stop. I would walk on eggshells around her. The pain was not the problem for me, it was being hated to death by the person I just married a month earlier. The day came when I was done, I hadn't slept in weeks. I was in a living nightmare. This kind of thing happened every day. We were parked in my car outside of our apartment, I don't remember the one sided argument, I wasn't even mentally there. I just remember sitting there getting punch in the face over and over and over and over again. She had a wedding ring that would cut deep, I was numb to it. Life had become pointless again. 

She did not want me going to work the next day, she started saying she was concerned for my well being, but doing her best to cover up the damage to my face. My eye was of course black, and red and cut. But I had to go to work, I couldn't lose my job. I was lying to people about what happened to me. I am a horrible lier. Right when my dad saw me he knew exactly what had happened to me without me telling him. I knew things would just get worse and I would end up dead. There was no fixing the situation, so I broke down and told my parents. My parents somehow weren't surprised. My dad even called my wife's mom. My dad told her there has been domestic violence going on at my and my wife's apartment. Her mother didn't even question if I had been beating her, it is like she already knew what her daughter was capable of without ever telling me anything of it. 

My parents helped me hide my vehicle due to her most likely damaging it in some way due to me staying with my parents. I had none of my belongings. After a few days I drove back to the apartment. I went in and she was just sitting on the couch not acknowledging me. I went into the closet and she ran in ripping all my clothes out and throwing them, then began pushing me and punching me. I tried holding her down again, but she was in a super human rage. I could not hold on to her, she began pulling my fingers back trying to break them but I got away. She threw lit candles at my head, I ran into the bathroom holding the door shut due to the lock being easily unlocked. I kept hearing something hit the door, and I yelled asking her what she was doing. The door was a cheap plywood door, and I began feel something poking through. Eventually I back away from the door, she the kicked a hole in the door and crawled in with the knife she was stabbing the door with. 

I quickly grabbed her had and was fighting over the knife as she was biting a chunk out of my arm. I pushed her and ran out of the apartment. The apartment had a door leading out to the balcony, and a door from the balcony to the stairs. I barely made it to the balcony door as I open it there stood my neighbors that looked like they were about to kick the living crap out of me. They could hear yelling and screaming, they thought because I am a guy I was the instigator. I could barely get the words out to tell them what was going on. Then she ran out of the apartment onto the balcony screaming and yelling at the top of her lungs, trying to open the door. The neighbors then started holding the door shut as they then figured out what was going on. The whole neighborhood could hear her screaming.

So many people came just watching this play out. The cops were called and she was taken to jail. I got a restraining order. I knew she was mental, but I knew that wasn't 100% who she actually was. Going to jail seemed to surely help her see reality. 

It has been a year and a half since this all happened. Again, we were only married for a month. For reasons I can't really explain, I have given her plenty of chances. Things always seem to head back into the direction of her being abusive. She hates my family. She tries to control my life, when she can't she goes ballistic. 

I am still married to her for reasons I honestly don't want to add to this. I fight with my feelings of loving her and being sickly depressed. I already had someone close to me die. And she threatens to end her life if we're not together. She has not been nearly as physical, but shows signs of things going back to the way they were. We do not live together, and it is almost as if we are dating again. I honestly want to run away. The nightmare is not over, I would prefer to kill myself. Please take time to get to know someone fully before getting married. I am locked into something that I can't get out of for reasons that are not meant to be said. I don't know how much longer I can do this. I am a human with a life, and so is she. I would rather die than continue upsetting peoples life with drama that surrounds me. And my body can't handle any more. I have many physical problems that seem to be permanent to me now. I try not to show it. My eye sight is leaving me as fast as my will to keep going through all this pain. 

I am still young, but my life is ruined. I wanted love, but now I hate myself as much as I am hated. People do have bigger problems than me, and I take comfort in knowing the ones that don't. I do not hate her, I have never had a reason to hate someone until I met my mistakes.",tsovpn,2019-03-11 00:18:26,12,2246,35.42,40.86,80.8,10.56,15.07,12.47,95.95,62.56,22.31,17.45,10.73,0.71,0,5.03,0.98,4.85,5.48,14.2,10.37,4.94,5.79,2.45,21.77,4.19,2.23,1.16,0.62,1.69,5.7,2.14,3.34,0.31,1.2,0.58,13.89,2.45,0.67,6.19,0.31,13.09,2.67,1.29,2.98,3.38,1.2,3.52,2.58,0.85,1.11,0.58,2.27,1.11,0.8,0.09,0.22,7.93,3.56,1.2,1.96,1.38,0.53,9.88,7.26,1.25,17.32,2.89,8.64,6.06,0.22,0.76,2.36,0.04,0,0.31,0.31,0.22,0,0.04,0.04,0,11.93,6.72,3.83,0,0,0.04,0,0,0,1.2,0.09,0.04
azqis1,"Can abuse happen on the phone? I feel confused and violated, first time this happened.","This is the first time this happened to me, and I feel scared, confused, quite violated too.  I can't even type sexual abuse as the title of this post because it's acknowledging it as such, and I feel I'm still in denial, if it really was. Maybe it's not like an obvious abuse, but certainly felt like it to me. I hope someone can help me or give me advice. You don't need to emphasize that it's my fault because I already know I am partly to blame. I just hope no one will downplay my feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL/DR:** Guy I met once, rarely talked to and still deemed as a friend, asked so many intimate sexual questions, making me think it was related to ""helping me understand my relationships and myself better."" I trusted him and realized only afterwards that it wasn't. I even started to think he was touching himself while we were on the phone because I thought I heard sounds, but there's no way for me to know or prove that it wasn't just all in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

**Long version:**

&amp;#x200B;

There's this guy I met travelling many years back, we live in opposite sides of the world and we exchanged numbers and sometimes would chat about what's going on about life. When we were still in touch more often after meeting, I've shared some of my romantic relationship issues with him including some intimate sexual details about it, since I come from a conservative country and there's not a lot of people I can talk to about that. After that, he would just chat me and ask if I can talk on the phone every few months, but we're not really close so I would always come up with an excuse not to.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, I finally gave in and had a convo with him. First he shared that he got married, and I shared that I just broke up with my ex. He's the ""leader/adviser"" type of person whom you'd go to if you needed some perspective, so he said he wanted to help me get through it, understand myself better etc. Then he started asking questions related to my sexual experiences/preferences. At first I was okay to answer them all because I really thought he was sincere in wanting to help me and maybe those questions were related to whatever ""understanding yourself better"" objective he had, but later on the questions were too specific that I really don't see the connection anymore. He would ask me what I did in bed, how wet I'd get, what I did with my fingers, did I feel any tingling down there while I was talking to him abt my ex, do i get turned on seeing anyone's penis, and many others i don't want to go into detail in. The reason I kept answering his questions was because I trusted he'd connect it to whatever advice he was going to give in relation to the ""subconscious"" sh\*t he was saying.

&amp;#x200B;

It was only the next day I realized I felt so awful about the whole conversation. I trusted him that night but I was only left confused. Then it dawned on me that he's a married guy and he's asking me all those questions and it just felt so wrong. So I gave him a call and said I felt uncomfortable and didn't he think something was wrong with the convo? He said no because we had a conversation like that in the past...but I said it was inappropriate esp. with him being married and I said we shouldn't have to talk about something like that again, and said he asked too many unrelated sexual questions. I asked him how all of it was related, but he gave the generic ""we were talking abt relationships and so you could see a diff. aspect."" But I don't see at all how it happened, he hardly gave any advice afterwards. I also asked if he was touching himself during the phone call, because i really thought I heard it but I wasn't sure at that time...but he said he wasn't and even seemed perplexed I asked, asked if had experience like that before which I didn't. I give him the benefit of the doubt about that. But he said he never meant to make me feel uncomfy and he thanked me for telling him what i feel. I said best to not keep in touch anymore, he says he respects it, I don't have to explain myself and we can not talk if it will only make me uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel awful and I partly blame myself,  because I did answer the questions after all. I am angry at myself for letting someone think they are my friend who is helping me but if I am to be honest, I feel quite used and violated. I don't even know if this is classified as abuse but I am left afraid and ashamed after that. I have blocked him online and his number. He even said ""if it helps, I apologize"" but that hardly counts because I know he thinks he didn't do anything wrong. I'm not expecting an apology who doesn't see anything wrong either.  I couldn't get mad either because i was scared.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to sort out my feelings and move on from this. It helps that I cut contact with him and I am proud of myself for communicating what I felt (even if I didn't get mad even if I wanted to) and took action, but like any trauma the words and experience stick to your mind and eat you up. I want to forgive myself, but don't really know where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope someone out there can help me out or give a friendly advice.

*i mention being trans cause i’ve tried coming out to them only for them to put me down and threaten to kick me out for being lgbt.

tonight my dad triggered me by screaming at me, cause i made dinner/breakfast (you know like making it the night before) for the family, and he thought i made it all for myself, i guess? he stomped his feet and i ran to my room crying cause of all the traumatic incidents that started with that sound lol

and my mom isn’t any different, they’re like the team rocket of abusers. i can’t call cps cause it’s a whole long process and i’d rather just wait it out till i can leave.

i’m self aware when they try to talk to me like we’re friends, but at this point i think i’m just gonna stop talking to them. not even for favors. i have two years left till i graduate, i’ll be 17 and when my best friend finds a living situation i’ll move in with him and restart my whole life

anyway i guess i just wanted to rant cause i don’t really wanna poison my friends with this shit. i’d like some advice on feeling like i won’t ever leave them? because my brothers around 22 and still living with us and i’m scared i’ll be like him lol.

They have low IQ (inability to read and comprehend simple stories).

Nothing you say to them will get them to 'wake' up from the fantasy of living a delusional life because their brain is incapable (at the time) to understand reason and reality.

Stupid people tend to not understand that they are stupid yet when they are given a scenario and asked to answer what is the right choice, they will be able to give you the correct answer. This does not translate into their application in day to day life.

Ignorant people always believe that they are the exception.

azwzmf,my brother was an abuser,"TW: incest, abuse

&amp;#x200B;

This is something that I want to get off my chest. I have two siblings. In my childhood, when I was 4 and my sister was 5, my brother wich had 13, obligate me and my 5 yo sister to kissing us and touch in front of him. He never touched us, but he usually kept in our room and put something 'romantic' movies and then he said that we needed to imitate them. My sister and I don't knew what the fuck were doing, this was just a game as he said. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents left us to the care of my  brother all my childhood but I don't remember when everything started or how long it lasted, but this caused me to have sexual and inapropiate behaviors with other peope as well. I don't remember my age, but it was before I turned six: one girl of the neighborhood (two years younger that I) came to play with me and my sister and I remember go to the room and tried to do what my brother did with us but i didn't. A while time then she stopped to came to our house and then she moved from neighborhood. Also I tried to spy my father when he was bathing and I tried to hug him in a very sexual form. I don't think he knew what I was trying to do (i only was a child!).

 I'm very ashamed, and this is something that still weighs on me. All my childhood I was urinating in bed because I had recurrent nightmares and at age of 9 I started to think seriously in suicide. This is something that I never told to anyone, and even I can't talk with my sister of this because I'm very ashamed. I don't know if she still remember that and I don't know if I should remind her

&amp;#x200B;

I have not seen the neighborhood girl again, but I think in her constantly and how I almost arruined her life, and i feel as a fucking  monster a fucking trash. The fault and nausea weighs on me

&amp;#x200B;

I never had a grudge on him because despite of this, he was a good brother and he cared of us when my parents didn't. He pay my college and stuffs like that. And this is the most annoyance for me.

azzqe7,Advice on how to help a friend in a potentially abusive marriage?,"I was thinking about ending a friendship, the responses I received urged me to remain friends and help my friend through what is being described as an abusive relationship. 
  
My friends husband has done the following:
  
the first time we hung out together last year he asked her to take a selfie with me to confirm she was out with me
  
The first time we hung out we went to dinner in the city and after that he said she was not allowed to go to the city anymore because it is “too far” and can’t get to her if something were to happen. However last week she asked me to recommend a place in the city for them to go on their anniversary. Apparently the city is now just for them, not with me. 
  
I asked her to go to a concert with me and he said no and his reason was “because they are Christian now” she said she did not want to argue about it even though she did not agree/understand his comment.
  
We stopped going to the city and started going out to restaurants closer to home, then she was told not to spend so much money so we had to cut back on how often we were going (once a month ish at that point)
  
The money thing started to get mentioned a lot. She was saying he always tells her not to buy anything so she hides what she buys from him. She does say since she is a recovering addict (2-3 years clean/sober), buying things is very tempting to her. But mostly its make up that she buys. She’s really in to it as a hobby etc. He racked up a lot of owed back taxes and she is helping him pay that off. I think that’s what a lot of this is about. Not much about saving for their future. 
  
He tracks her on his phone. If she is not where she is “supposed” to be he calls her and texts her repeatedly.  Because of this she lies about where she is or shuts her location services off and tells him her phone is not working. One time I was driving us to lunch and he called to check in.... magically while she was supposed to be at home. He checks in with her at least once when we are hanging out. While in the car with me she said she was just at home and ended the convo quickly by saying she was about to get in the shower.  Another time she went to the store and he blew up her phone with 10 missed calls in an hour. When she didnt pick up he turned his phone off. My friend drove to his work and confronted him and said he apologized. 
  
She has recently had talks about him not trusting her and in the past has said he needs to be able to “let her live her life”. She says he just “wants to keep her safe” or “worries about ‘something’ happening”
  
Whenever we hang out, the husband is never around. Seems almost on purpose. I have met him briefly 2-3 times over the last year. No longer than 5 minutes. Was not interested in getting to know me. Pretty cold.
  
he does not have a car or a license. We are all in our late 20s so I think this is unusual. She drives him/them everywhere. 
  
  
Thats all I can think of right now. But to sum it up I was thinking of ending the friendship because it is too difficult to keep going based on her strict “rules” of being able to hang out. The rules seem to keep evolving.  Also I do feel sort of weird being associated with the lying about not being out when she really is. I just feel generally uncomfortable with the tracking and the constantly being told “no” for everything. On the day she lied while we were driving she then sat at lunch and told me they were trying to have their first child. I just like shut down... no clue how to approach this with my friend. I typically stay out of peoples relationships because I know they are never one size fits all or romantic fairy tales.... but as I said I was urged to seek guidance on a potentially abusive situation. My friend makes excuses like “oh he just worries” or “he just wants to make sure I’m saving money for our future”. Etc. but it seems extreme. 
  
Any advice on how I can approach my friend or perhaps let her casually know she can talk to me would be much appreciated.",fluidthrowaway1,2019-03-11 15:23:06,2,801,40.06,86.13,29.26,15.27,16.69,12.11,95.13,63.05,20.35,16.85,4.24,1.62,0,9.86,1.12,3.5,4.99,16.48,8.74,7.12,7.12,2.62,19.35,2.62,1.37,1.62,1.62,1.5,3.12,1.12,1.87,0.37,1,0.12,20.1,0.37,1,6.24,3.87,12.86,2.12,2.37,1,4,1.12,4,2.5,0.12,2,0.37,0.87,0,0.37,0,0.5,8.36,3.87,1.5,1.75,0.87,0.62,6.62,11.11,1.5,18.23,3.12,8.24,7.62,0.75,0.62,0.5,1.75,0.12,0,0.37,0,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,12.11,6.87,0.62,0.12,0,0.12,0,0.25,2.62,0.62,0.5,0.37

b00jen,"I'm tired, Reddit","I don't know. I'm just exhausted of this, and I need to get it out, and I don't know who to else to tell. 

I'm 29, and due to some unfortunate circumstances, I'm living my parents again. My dad's okay. An enabler for sure, negligent and sometimes emotionally abusive, but I'll take it. My mom on the other hand, hoo boy. 

My whole life she's been horrible to me. Verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive. She used to beat the shit out of my brother and I when we were kids and then send us to school with makeup on to cover the marks. She belittled me and destroyed my self esteem just so she could feel better about herself. She twisted most of our interactions and confrontations so that I was the bad guy, basically accusing *me* of abusing *her*, so my dad would never get involved or step in because he 'didn't know who to believe'. (Hint: believe the ten year old crying so hard they almost throw up, not the grown woman fake crying.) 

This was my whole childhood up until I went to college and got away from it, and then it continued when I came back to visit and then after I graduated and I moved back in. At some point we figured out that she was severely mentally unstable. Some of the stuff she said proved that she was detached from reality, having paranoid delusions, and she was convinced that we were all out to get her. She isolated herself from the outside world, went weeks without eating or bathing, and then emerged convinced that she was literally a god. 

What was already bad just got worse from there. 

I moved out for almost three years, but I just moved back in, and it was okay for the most part. I was trying to stay on her good side, avoiding her when I could, playing nice or grey rocking when I couldn't. Sometimes she's totally pleasant, and sometimes, like today, she's like a fucking monster. 

I was standing in the kitchen about half an hour ago, making dinner. She comes storming in, gets right in my face, and screams that she's going to 'fucking take me out' because apparently I tampered with her food on behalf of my aunt, who she hates (for reasons she created in her own head). She then proceeded to start throwing food away because it was 'poisoned' and then slammed her door after screaming that she'd kill every one of us. 

It's mostly all talk, I'm pretty sure. She hasn't put a hand on me since I was a teenager, but I'm just getting sick of being treated like shit. There's no way to defend against it because she lives in her own little world, and my dad won't force her to get therapy or take her anywhere. I know I have to get out of here, but I can't afford it yet, and I'm so exhausted of walking around on eggshells because she has no concept of reality. Maybe I'd be more sympathetic to her if she hadn't always been a terrible, abusive parent. 

I'm not really looking for advice, more just to vent so I don't start crying into this glass of whiskey.",asphodellic,2019-03-11 16:33:55,3,548,23.59,43.47,65.29,1,18.27,17.15,93.25,60.04,21.17,16.61,8.58,1.09,0,6.75,0.18,4.56,3.1,15.15,8.94,6.93,9.49,2.74,18.61,3.28,2.01,1.46,0.91,2.37,8.03,2.01,6.02,0.55,2.37,0.73,12.77,1.46,0.36,7.12,1.28,12.96,2.19,2.19,1.09,3.83,1.64,3.47,1.64,0.36,0.55,0.73,4.56,1.09,1.82,0.36,1.28,7.3,2.01,0.91,1.28,2.55,0.91,5.84,9.31,1.64,16.97,3.1,7.66,6.93,0.55,0.73,0.55,0,0.18,0.18,1.28,0.73,0.18,0.36,0,0,19.53,5.29,6.57,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,6.02,0.73,0.73

b00qng,REPOST: It's been a year since I left a 12 year marriage to a man with borderline personality disorder and it's just getting worse. I want to move,"Background. Met in 2006  when I was 17 he was 27. Stayed together until last April. He started choking me a year in. I've had guns held to my head. Threats he'd kill me. Etc. I have always been financially independent of him. Have a good career. Shitty neglectful and abusive parents which is why I didn't really wake up until last year after they both died. I was extremely isolated and never had spent even one Saturday in 12 years alone and had almost no friends. 

I tried leaving several times before and always went back. But finally I ended it for good last April. He spent months being crazy, insisting on keeping cameras in my house (we'd had them for years and I never had access), showing up randomly, threatening me and other people I was seeing or made friends with, actually tried to kill me twice, stalked me, used lawyers to intimidate me, camped himself in my house in December up until mid January (literally would only leave to go to work and I was too afraid for a long time to force it) when I again stood up firmly. 

He's been arrested, gone to jail, is on probation, divorce is final for many months, I've tried no contact, been in counseling weekly, I had a restraining order at one point. 

My therapist specializes in this stuff. I've worked with her for 6 years and she's helped me through everything. I have full faith in her.

Anyway he knows how to manipulate me and get to me. Extremely well. He studied psychology purposefully to learn how to manipulate people. He's an extremely intelligent man. He's a senior security expert and could track me down to the ends of the earth if he wanted. The kind of guy the mob or whatever would hire to find people. He's an insanely talented hacker. Very charismatic and has turned many people against me. 

When he got arrested that's when he got very dangerous. I have called the police 6 times. 1x he managed to almost get me committed to a mental hospital and arrested for hurting him (I'm 5'3 and he's 6'2) despite me having bruises from being choked (he can manipulate almost anything) . 4x they never even showed up. 1x they did and he was arrested because he was too drunk to talk his way out of it.

The police here are useless. The restraining order got fought and reneged. He told me if I ever call them again he will hunt me down forever. He's not above paying people to do his dirty work either. 

He uses psychological manipulation on me. I can't block him entirely because then I have less warning when he shows up and gets crazy. He's started dating a 21 year old (he's 40) and drives by my neighborhood 2x a day, eats at the places near me, shops at my grocery store with her despite him living downtown, which I have to avoid entirely. He never says any of this in text and records me and can manipulate things to make it look like he did nothing wrong. 

He knows how to hook me in and get a response. Most my family is dead so I'm pretty alone here and he plays on that. He chases away anyone I get close to, used whoever he is dating to mess with my head, and uses my loneliness against me. I also got hit by a semi truck yeara ago and have injuries that require me to need physical help picking up anything over 20lbs, he also manipulates that. 

I'm at the point I have no choice but to move. The couple close friends I have who have witnessed everything and know what I'm dealing with, they still tell me to just call the police everytime and I get blamed for some of what he does because I won't call them anymore. I had one person with me once when I called and they literally told me they were too busy to come since my ex had fled the premises already. That person is the only one who believes me the police aren't reliable. 

I can't call the police. My psychologist agrees its the most dangerous thing I could do. She's been suggesting moving since day 1 but I own a house here and have fought against it for a year. 

But he came over yesterday and convinced me to let him in somehow and tried to force himself on me. He then left and blamed me. I'm completely traumatized. I don't feel safe at home. I don't feel safe nearby me where he takes his gf, I don't feel safe downtown or pretty much any bar in town (he's an alcoholic and literally bounces around places to make me afraid of going absolutely anywhere). I have massive PTSD and have gotten fmla from work twice. I'm bipolar too and this is causing me major episodes and my life is falling apart. 

I desperately want to move. I'm an engineer and I need to be in good mental shape to interview for what I do, it's math based and hard as heck so it'll probably take a couple months. But people tell me in running away and letting him run my life and I just need to call the police or find a way to be do this or do that. They tell me moving is bull crap and get mad at me. 

I feel really alone and like it is my fault. I do take accountability for talking to him or letting him near me. Sometimes it's to placate him and stay safe, other times he manipulates me and later I am so confused what the eff happened. But I have made mistakes. I can own that. But he is dangerous, he is smart, and I'm terrified of him and don't want to ever involve the police again. I'm losing any support network I have because of it though. I'm starting the resume process tomorrow and am committed to moving. 

I guess I just needed to get this out. Hear from anyone whoever went through anything similar. 

What are some good resources? 

Is moving really that crazy? I feel like I'll end up dead from him, my own mental health, or from having panic attacks and driving or something and I end up in an accident. If I stay I'm certain it'll be the end of me somehow. It's a year later and things are not getting better.",vikingmaiden3,2019-03-11 16:52:27,8,1123,21.75,34.75,72.93,5.17,14.4,15.41,92.97,58.86,21.64,16.74,10.33,0.09,0,5.43,0.89,4.9,3.92,12.56,10.95,5.88,8.19,1.69,20.75,3.56,1.34,2.05,1.87,1.6,5.7,1.87,3.83,0.8,1.25,0.8,11.67,0.36,0.62,0.53,5.25,13.36,1.25,3.03,1.42,3.47,2.05,3.38,1.25,0.45,0.18,0.62,1.87,0.53,1.07,0,0.45,9.26,1.25,0.98,3.83,2.14,1.51,6.41,12.73,0.8,16.56,2.4,6.95,7.39,2.67,0.62,0.53,0.62,0.09,0.45,0.71,0.27,0.09,0.09,0.09,0.09,14.6,6.68,2.4,0.09,0,0.18,0,0,0,4.19,1.07,0
b00sdp,Lifetime abuse survivor/ maybe you can find hope from my story,"Trigger warning emotional abuse and attempted suicide
Age 1-10~ I lived with my mom and dad. My mom's mom also was with us probably 80 hours a week basically lived there but had her own house. My great grandmother too. Mom's side.
My mom worked 12 hours a day seven days a week. As a pharmacist she made good money it wasn't because she had no choice. My dad started working more because everyone griped at him all the time.

 My mom, grandmother, and great grandmother all wanted me to be what they wanted me to be and all my dad wanted was me to be myself as I wanted to be as long as it was self sufficient.
I know this now but not then( looking back and 4 years of therapy, I would say I see it now for what it was) my three generations on Mom's side used emotional manipulation, thought manipulation and so on. They had me doing everything for them the way they wanted and caused me to ""like"" it and feel bad for wanting for myself.

10-12 my dad becomes abusive because he can't break through to me and get me to think for myself this engaged him and would end in him getting physical. ( My dad isn't the smartest, by no means an idiot but when it comes to to emotional conversation he's let's say emotionally constipated)

13 parents get a divorce and mom hooks up with a real sack of crap far more emotionally manipulative than anyone I've ever seen on top of it he has a background in criminal psychology/behavior analysis crap. In short if you don't know about classical conditioning, positive/negative feedback you wouldn't know he was manipulating you. And he puts me through even more crap.

TRIGGER WARNING THINGS GET DARK HERE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE!!!! Stop here if you can't handle this stuff. Thanks

13-17 everything got worse. I lost the will to live completely. I was just going through the motions they had me down to the point the decided what I was allowed to wear, shoes/house shoes I wasn't allowed to get my driver's license. They did their best to make me hate dad. They controlled what I watched, played video games, internet access, any interaction with people.

16 I was at my dad's on one weekend and he broke down in tears / emotional stuff it hurts too much to type basically he apologized and meant it he had been going to therapy and everything. I forgave him and all has been good with me and him since (I'm living with him while I finish college, 22 now)

18-19 finished high school and was enrolling in college made a 26 on the act only had to take 1 gen Ed. Writing was it. I was never allowed to write at home (as it is an expression of yourself Imprtant later) also part of why my grammar is so bad. I wasn't sure what I wanted to be yet at the time it was an RN. Anyway my classes were going to be psychology (important) nutrition, trigonometry, film history. 

IF ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BOTHERS YOU TURN BACK NOW!!!
we get into a fight at home. I refuse to give my food to my step dad's son keep in mind my first plate he's on number 4. And he snaps /roughly 4 hours of screaming literally 6p-10pm and ripped s everything out of my room except a blanket and pillow. The next day I'm still upset and haven't recovered they are gone and I'm home alone I decided that I've had enough I go to their bedroom and get the hunt shotgun and grab the buckshot from the sidesaddle and load it. (While I'm doing this the inside of my head is still screaming at need about how worthless I am and how I'll never amount to anything. Auditory hallucinations so loud I thought my ears would start bleeding.) 
Anyway I racked the slide and put the barrel in my mouth and what was a couple seconds that felt like an eternity I pulled the trigger and everything went silent. For the first time in almost a decade i felt at peace. But somehow I was still alive. I took the barrel out of my mouth and open chamber and examined the round it struck the primer but didn't ignite the powder. (On a side note it's the only shell in my lifetime that was a dud I'm and avid sportsman)
I put the gun back and take the dud round and dispose of it.

END OF TRIGGER WARNING, ITS ALL UPHILL FROM HERE.

I got my driver's license as classes started. As I convinced them it was a waste of their time to take me to class.
19 in psychology class i was learning about manipulation and attempted mind control projects. And started using what I was learning combined with therapy from an independent therapist who I talked to and agreed to help me through unconventional means I began to regain control of my own mind. 

Before my 21st birthday I moved in with my dad. I moved everything i owned in 3 hours while my mom and step dad were out of town.

I decided to transfer to trade school a become a combination welder I will be done come this Christmas. And be certified in SMAW and GMAW I will have the skill but have to get certified in GTAW later. And an associate degree in science.
I have my 3g certification in GMAW already.
I've taken no loans and have no debt. And have $5k to my name

I cover my car insurance, phone, and groceries.

b02f2p,I'm lost and worried about this,"Okay, to start this is long but I just want to know what to do with my life moving forward 
I'm about to be 16, I've got a younger 7 yrs old sister and my mom has had several boyfriends 
I just want to know if this is abuse and what to do because I'm scared in a way
This is mainly about my mom but I'd like to give a backstory to it

So,, in the beginning(?)
When I was younger (6-7ish) my even younger (5 month younger) cousin would make me do sexual things with him and it freaked me out and I was scared if I said no he wouldn't be my friend 
I told my mom several times and my great grandparents 
Not much happened except they apparently told him to stop 
I gave up eventually I guess 
Later I (like an idiot at maybe 7yrs) followed a kid neighbor into the bushes to do other sexual things because I thought maybe he'll like me better, I never told anyone (more later on this) and a lot of my childhood after this is so gone it really worries me (it's almost completely gone..)

On to actual abuse worries:
Which worries me because my mom frequently made threats and I flinched badly at them. She just stopped the frequency lately but the occasional one makes me worried
At school when it happens I either brace for a hit or scream and things by my neck FREAK me out so bad that I violently flinch
I'm worried something else happened but there's so many holes in my memory 

Not really abuse but it sorta is? 
My mom has dated many people (to me at least) and so I'll divide this next bit up by each person 

Gabe:
My mom actually married him but broke up after three years 
We moved a lot during this and I actually cared about him I think
It was cold up there, he was a ditz and hung out with Tennessee wannabe gangsta
Dunno much else

Kyle:
He came into my life when he was 17, I was 7, and my mom was almost 30
It wasn't long after my mom left Gabe
I didn't like him, he creeped me out and I told my mom that but she dated him anyway 
A week after I met him he pushed me down and I chipped my tooth while playing and I played it off because I was scared of what my mom would think I guess 
My sister was born when I was 8, a year later 
Things were ok
My mom was working a lot though once my sister turned 1ish and Kyle wasn't emotionally supportive at all
I know I thought regularly around this time about how I must've done something wrong (it wasn't really that much to do with my sister surprisingly but it definitely played a paty) so I tried harder and harder to please my mom but got shoved farther away 
Then Kyle cut open the back of his foot and spent 3 months crying in his room while my mom was at work all the time so I spent over three months (due to recovery time and stuff so probs 6 months or more) watching TV and my sister spent that time watching it too 
After the above my instincts came true
Kyle stared yelling and getting evil practically 
I left the equivalent of a piece of soap in  the tub and I got my ass beat although it was mainly my arm so I couldn't write well the next day but I was fine by the time I came home 
He'd also terrorize me with a little clown when I took longer than 30 minutes in the shower (my mom never really told me how to shower and I felt safer in there..) it'd laugh evilly and he'd turn the lights off during it and I'm pretty sure this is why I hate showering now and take forever 
He and my mom would laugh about it too
Anyway 
He would scream at my mom and he punched holes in doors and beat up his car and scared my mom and me but I'd celebrate because I'd go ""maybe they'll break up?!?"" And get excited enough to jump up and down 
They didn't break up till my mom found out he was cheating and claimed it was about him beating me up over the soap incident 
I remember being scared to say I was sick and puking all over and hiding it so I could leave 
Now I complain when I'm not that sick but when I'm actually sick I hide it in something sorta like fear

Cameron:
The curse disguised as a blessing 
He was forgetful and had seizures (more later) but nice
He was science-y and liked to experiment like me 
I related to him enough that he'd ask me if he was a creep or if I'd date him if he was my age 
He had to have been grooming me for sexual shit
I can't get over this realization- sorry for my language 
I sat there and talked to him wrapped in a towel soaking wet and naked 
God.. what could've happened....
Anyway I need to continue 
I thought he was the best 
His seizures freaked me out but I never really saw them 
My mom went back to work somewhere else and he got saddled with more and more chores but he was a slacker so we spent most of this time eating trash food at fast food places 
They got together after my mom broke up with Kyle after only 5 months or so and I got to watch through the window of Kyle pistol whipping Cameron at 12ish yrs old 
Later on I found out my mom has been smoking weed for most of my life and it helped explain why a lot of the few memories I have of my mom were of being shut out so she could go smoke
Kyle turned out to be a drug dealer (eventually) and when he lived with us he'd sell weed (but sold more types of things outside of our house I just know it) 
As such he was pinpointed as a druggie but the cops thought his address was our address
I got woken up a 7 am to a gun pointed at me
They were trying to do a drug bust and had called in a swat team on us
Me and my 5yr old sister were questioned and told our boarderline hoarder religious nut grandma and 100% likely to be insane ex-grandpa had custody of us
That was after we saw Cameron drug outside, in the nude, by the police 
Him being naked caused a lot of problems along with the weed they still had in their drawer to smoke 
The next day we had to go to a place for my mom to get drug tested and she made ME piss in a bottle so she wouldn't get caught and wanted my sister to as well and that kinda was the breaking point 
I had hated my mom before but now I was just detached from her 
I was confused and all my mom told me now seem like excuses and I lied to police for her..
She weaseled out of it and eventually broke up with Cameron 


I feel like I'm making this out to be worse than it really was
But that's what emotional abuse does? But is it just me telling it biased?
I haven't even finished my story but I feel like your minds would already be made up after reading this so far? 


I'll continue a little more I guess 
Fast forward a few years till now 
I came out as gay and my mom called me an abomination to a group of people I consider friends
My mom is being nice to me 
She still favors my sister blatantly and rudely and I get yelled at when my sister doesn't 
She's dating someone who cares and my mom is doing things instead of how she'd eventually make the person she was dating do everything but she's not doing a lot tbh
She hasn't yelled really or threatened me lately 
What do I do? 
Is it even abuse or anything? 
How do I tell if I'm making shit up or being sensitive?
Am I victimizing myself.?
Am I lying about how I feel? 
How do I tell if me thinking she's being nice is not actually nice?
Is it really abuse even..?
Should I cut her out?
She's acting like a parent.. not the best but idek..
She's still smoking weed..
I want to move out tbh
Should I wait because she's being a nice person? 
I've battled with some dark thoughts and I think I'd do better away from here but I'm just so lost 
Please if you can answer at least one of my questions..
I'm sorry it was so long but I needed it off my chest I guess...",Simplysamst,2019-03-11 19:36:22,7,1529,17.54,25.43,87.8,5.16,56.63,10.92,93.53,61.28,21.98,17,11.71,0.65,0.13,3.92,0.59,4.91,4.05,12.88,10.07,7.52,9.94,1.44,20.01,5.76,3.79,1.64,1.24,2.35,6.67,2.35,4.32,1.05,1.5,0.52,11.31,2.81,0.33,3.73,2.94,13.34,1.96,1.57,1.83,3.66,0.98,5.04,1.64,0.52,0.59,0.52,2.49,0.78,0.98,0.46,0.46,7,2.16,1.11,2.42,1.37,0.72,8.7,8.5,0.59,15.04,1.77,6.67,7,0.72,0.39,0.78,0.39,0.2,0,1.37,0.52,0.33,0.13,0.13,0.26,9.48,1.77,0.78,0.26,0,1.05,0.07,0.26,0.13,3.4,1.7,0.07

b046w9,Entitled Dad sexually harrass me and gets angry I have a girlfriend,"Okay, so I don't actually know if this post belongs in here. I'm new to reddit, and still trying to learn. I feel like I should add a TW because it gets out of hand really fast...   
TW: Sexual harrassment, homophobia

TL DR at the bottom.

 

Okay, so back around new years, I went to this party with my friends. We were celebrating new years and the fact I'd gotten into my dream school. 

At this party is 4 of my (at the time) Best Friends and an elder man (father of one of them).

For the ease, We'll call these friends:

Mini - My friend through 7 years.

Mark - Mini's Boyfriend, and my friend through 5 years

Jessi - Friend for close to 3 years

James - Jessi's fiance and my friend for close to 3 years

Fuckface - Jessi's dad. 

To make a thing clear: I have never met Fuckface before. Everyone else knew him, and they were close, so I was pretty cool with him being there, since I trusted my friends. 

AND I was told he'd be sober for the night, since he had to drive home.

At the party, Mini and Mark goes HARD from around 4pm. I'm not used to drinking, so I tend to get really wasted fast, and then sober up over a few hours. 

Around 8pm Jessi, James and Fuckface shows up. Fuckface is WASTED, Way more wasted than I've ever seen someone outside a hospital! 

Fuckface shakes my hand ""It's nice to meet you"" and within 5 minutes starts telling me how beautiful I am. RED FLAG! 

Over the night he gets really close. Actually ""sleeping"" against me and LICKING MY SHIRT on my breast. 

I tell Jessi that her father is freaking me out, and she tells me to ""Calm down, he's just joking!"".

Fast forward to around 11pm. Fuckface has:

\- Tried kissing me, by pulling my hair, forcing my head closer to his.

\- Stalked me around the appartment.

\- Followed me outside when I ""needed some fresh air""

\- Licked my shirt AGAIN

\- PHYSICALLY HELD ME PINNED DOWN ON THE COUCH, to ""tickle me"" (touching all over my thighs and stomach) and when I started screaming for him to let me go, people laughed ""Haha, you're so ticklish!"" FUCKING HURT! 

First chance I get, when he leaves for the bathroom, I inform EVERYONE at the party ""Hey... I'm uncomfortable. Fuckface is sexually harassing me, and I want to go home..."" 

Mind you - I'm still pretty drunk, and we're in the middle of nowhere, so I can't just leave.

Everyone tells me ""He's just joking. Don't be so sensitive!"" 

(I know my friends where drunk too, but COME ON! :c) 

We're out for fresh air, and he decides to pin me against the balcony wall. Arm pressing on my chest so I can't move, and tells me ""I can be so good for you! Just give me a chance!""

Me: ""Sorry, but my \*girlfriend\* wouldn't like sharing. Hehe"" 

Fuckface: ""Forget that bitch. I can fuck you so good, you wont ever think of her again!"" 

He goes on and on for like 10 minutes about how my girlfriend is just ""some polish bitch, in it for my money"" and ""I should give a real man a chance!"" and makes very strong sexual comments to- and about me. 

This is my snapping point. I tell my friends ""If this creep touches me again, I'll fucking punch him!"" and one of them points out ""You may not wanna do that, he's in a gang."" PANIC! Sheer, unfiltered Panic! Rest of the night, I tiptoe around him. Making sure there's people between us. Sitting on chairs where I'll be sitting alone, etc.

I think James really caught on, because he sat and cuddled me for an hour or so after, keeping distance between me and Fuckface. 

Later the same night, Fuckface desides to do that thing where he locks his arm around my neck and whispers really wierd, sexual graphic shit into my ear .. He starts being REALLY homophobic! 

Telling me how ""Lesbians are just cunts that didn't get fucked good enough!"" and my girlfriend is just ""Some polish cunt. She'll never fuck you as good as a real man!"" at some point he says OUT LOUD in the room ""All pussies just wants a good cock to ride!"" and my friends STILL INSIST that this is all just a joke! 

\*knocks on wood\* He leaves after midnight. I'm so fucking exhausted I tell people almost the second he leaves ""Hey I'm tired, goodnight!"" and cries myself to sleep. I felt so violated, and this bitch thought it was 100% okay because no one said anything :c

&amp;#x200B;

Day after his daughter calls me ""Hey dad wants to talk to you"" and my stupid brain thinks ""Ha maybe he's sorry!"" NOPE. Bitch wanted to ""thank me for last night"" and tell me he wanted to see me again. I tell him politely ""That's not gonna happen, you insulted my girlfriend and really freaked me out"" and HE GETS PISSED! 

Acting like he fucking owns me, and starts bitching about how he was ""just messing with me"" and ""It wasn't personal"" and his daughter fucking joins in on that shit! 

So much for being friends I guess... I've been avoiding all but Mark since then, since Mark spends a lot of his time at the place I work, so he's hard to avoid... I'm hurt, feel betrayed and angry. 

Sorry for the long post.   


TL DR:  
Friends dad sexually harrass me all night, 4 friends tells me to ""chill, it's just his way of joking"" he goes homophobic on me and starts talking trash about my Girlfriend.   
Calls me day after to ask me for ""another meeting"" I tell him no and he gets really angry because ""He was just kidding!""

b05z8j,my father needs to be arrested,"my father is a abusive father. both emotionally and definitely physically. he's been physically abusing me since I'd say 12-13. Not crazy everyday buz when he did he would punch me in my face and spit on me, walk out of the room and later act like nothing ever happened. he even has the audacity to go to the theater with me after such incidents and expects me to be happy and fun even though I just want to lay in bed without him near. 

He's always known to be an aggressive man most family members and probably some neighbors are well aware of it. The bad part is that most of his friends and colleagues think he's just your everyday normal guy from work. 

he's also been physically and emotionally abusive to my sister, 19, even going as far as hitting her multiple times while calling her a whore while doing it. we were at some old friends house and we all sat in the other room listening to it before he said goodbye and ordered me to get in the car. That was a little over a year ago and I guess things haven't been as bad with him and her anymore but I'm still struggling. 

Currently I'm also struggling to find a job which makes him mad all the time. Very recently he woke me up from my sleep, threw me to the ground and beat me repeatedly. he told me to stand up and then put me in a chokehold, he asked me if I wanted to die and that he was going to kill me. If it wasn't for my mom Intervening I believe that there is a very plausible chance that I probably wouldn't be alive anymore. He asked me multiple times if I wanted to die then and there. I said no, lying 50/50. 

This is not the first time he's threatened to actually kill me and it sure as hell won't be the last time. He's told me so many times that he doesn't love me and I couldn't even count it on all my toes and fingers. To him I'm the definition of disappointment. He told me he doesn't consider me his son anymore and that when people ask if he has children he replies ""only a daughter"". that's what he told me once. I really feel like he's going to murder me and possibly out of his rage hurt himself or someone else. I feel like it's just a matter of time. I am scared to live in his presence as I am happiest when he's at work or not at home. I can never be happy or be myself around him and I feel like he doesn't even know my happy silly side because I can't show it in front of him. I'm too scared to tell my mom or friends how I truly feel. I want to report him to the police and just get him either arrested or removed from my life it would be best for all of us. i am also 17 and non religious so yeah. thx for the help",enesyueksel1,2019-03-12 03:00:14,1,534,13.89,42.57,48.58,6.79,17.8,12.55,95.69,63.3,23.78,18.54,10.3,0.56,0.19,7.49,0,5.24,4.31,13.11,9.74,6.93,10.11,3,18.16,4.87,3.37,1.12,1.5,2.62,6.55,2.43,4.12,0.94,2.25,0.37,15.36,1.69,1.12,1.31,8.05,13.48,2.25,0.75,2.62,3.56,2.43,4.31,2.06,0.19,0.75,1.12,2.62,0.94,1.31,0.19,0,5.62,2.43,0.94,2.06,0.56,0.56,4.49,12.36,1.31,14.04,1.69,5.24,7.12,1.12,0.56,1.31,0,0.37,1.12,0.94,0.37,0.19,0.19,0.19,0,11.61,5.24,1.12,0,0,0,0,0.19,0.37,4.49,0,0.19
b086tz,"Friend is 26 and his mom hits him for being gay, leaving bruises and drawing blood","He lives in Chicago, and whenever he says he's going to call the police, she only says that ""You hit yourself, they aren't going to arrest me for that"". He also doesn't trust them, and feels like if he calls them, he'll be the one that ends up being arrested. 

He has no relatives that can or will help him in his situation, and all of his friends live far away. 

I want him to actually call the police, but if he won't do it, what other advice could I give him? 

I wanted to tell him to hit her back, as that's the only thing I can think of, is there anything else I can tell him?

b08ajn,Dealing with childhood trauma,"My son was molested as a young child and he is struggling so much with it. He has been struggling for years. It breaks my heart to know he is going to carry this pain with him for the rest of his life. We have been trying to get continuous services for him but unfortunately it’s been on and off with wait lists and things like that. 

I have been working very closely with his school this year because he is moving to middle school next year... and honestly I am dreading it. I’m considering doing blended school with him next year, I don’t want him to avoid social interactions but, boys are at that age where inappropriate things are funny and my son can’t handle that without getting triggered. He doesn’t want to walk away, which is rough. Add to that that peers will start with increased social pressure in middle school, and the school is way more populated with more freedoms. Recipe for disaster.

He’s in therapy, he’s in an Afterschool club for children with autism, but his behavior prevents him from going to that as often as he’s supposed to, he now has WRAP around services and we will be getting a TSS for him in about a month. He’s in karate, but his social anxiety is getting the best of him and I can’t afford for him to take private lessons. I’m looking at other options for him to be physically active in hopes that will help him be more self confident, give him a different outlet for his frustration and maybe the endorphins will help him feel better temporarily.

I tried talking to him about getting an emotional support animal (theres a therapy dog at his Afterschool club, and he loves animals so I thought he’d be on board with it... but he wanted none of it) 

Watching him kills me sometimes, and seeing how much he struggles. I remember him before the trauma and I miss that kid. It’s not his fault of course, and I would never say that to him, he’s not deficient in any way, I just miss seeing him carefree and happy. He’s a great kid, he is smart and kind. 

I feel so guilty at times, being a single parent. I spend so much time doing *things* like working, or having meetings an appointments that by the time I get home at night I am dealing with my own struggles. I’m only human, and it’s so tough being alone. 

I don’t have much else to say, there isn’t really an appropriate end to this topic. Thank you for reading.

b0apcv,Why do the memories keep creeping up,"I was abused as a child by a relative. I never told anyone when it happened because I was too scared of the consequences and my mom was almost scary protective about those things due to her childhood trauma. She would always tell me to tell her if something happened but then would comment how she wouldn’t be able to handle it. I have only ever told my husband and that was out of necessity for our relationship.

I used to think about the assault every day and had nightmares in which I would scream/cry and wake up my husband (poor guy was terrified). He has always been my rock and has helped me to start to move on...but every now and then I break all over. 

I will go months without giving it any thought and then I read a book, see a news article, have a random conversation, smell a certain smell...and then suddenly I’m that five year old kid again and I’m reliving all my memories over and over. The pictures won’t get out of my head and it’s hard to breathe and my chest just hurts. It started again last night and I can’t sleep and just want to lay in bed. 

I guess I just want to know if it ever goes away...if I will ever be normal and not have to relive these memories. I’m so exhausted and I just don’t feel strong enough to handle this and wish it would go away.

b0bowm,I have no words.,"I've recently found out that a friend of 5 years or so years was abusing her sister.

She's hit her, yelled at her, blamed her, for the most smallest things. Even her sisters autoimmune disease which is one not her fault and two in her genes. Her sisters mental illness. Her sisters mistakes. And even going as far as purposefully making her flinch.

In therapy I learned that abuse victims tend to be drawn to abusers. They wait and wait for the next explosion. 

Maybe that's why I stuck around. My mother was abusive and so were all her boyfriends. She was my only friend. She's one of the only ways I could get fed as well. 

She'd do things to make me sad and upset. She'd tell me I was faking my illnesses and faking being trans. (I'm non binary but identified as solely trans masculine ftm) even it wasn't a fight it was behind my back to her sister. Who was at the time also questioning her sexuality and identity.  And also dealing with mental illness. 

She's only said sorry to me once. There's so many other things I could call her out on. I might go the guidance counselor.",caverdae,2019-03-12 12:09:31,2,206,8.91,75.18,6.98,1,9.81,13.59,90.78,59.22,23.3,17.96,7.77,0,0,9.71,0.49,5.34,3.4,11.17,12.14,8.25,9.22,1.46,20.39,7.28,3.4,1.46,2.43,1.46,6.8,0.49,6.31,0.49,3.4,0.97,18.45,2.91,1.46,12.62,0.97,9.71,1.94,1.94,1.46,2.43,0.49,2.43,0.97,0,0.97,0,3.4,0,2.43,0.49,0.49,6.31,3.88,0.49,0.97,0.49,0.49,6.8,8.74,0.97,11.17,0.97,6.31,4.37,0.97,0,0,0,0,0,0.49,0,0,0,0.49,0,17.48,10.19,1.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.85,0.97,0
b0f3x4,My friend tells me she is into 'ageplay.',"Buckle up, it's a long one.

Me and this friend have been friends for years, and we're very open to eachother, but this....is something I've never experienced before. Again, we are really open and we've openly talked about our kinks and fetishes, although it sometimes bothered me where she chose to bring it up (public places, etc) and when she brought it up (trying to have a regular conversation when she randomly brings it up, etc) but I just figured she was just dealing with hormones as we are both 16. She recently got a boyfriend and was telling me about his kinks and whatever. Out of NOWHERE she tells me ""yeah me and him are doing something where I pretend I'm younger, and have to be punished for doing bad stuff."" I look at her confused, I honestly thought she was kidding at first. I ask her ""that sounds a lot like ageplay?"" And she goes ""yeah! It IS."" 

I stare at her in disbelief. I just cant comprehend what she told me. Listen, me and her are open and we dont kinkshame eachother or anything. Most of her kinks are just sort of normal like daddy/bdsm or whatever. I never really cared. But this was just so disgusting. How can someone pretend to be CHILDREN for SEXUAL PLEASURE? I actually gagged in front of her, and I didnt bother asking how 'old' she was in the roleplay. I excused myself and went to the school bathroom to think. I knew her boyfriend and I'm actually friends with him too, and he seems just as horny all the time as her, if not more. Hes told me that he wants to do a sexual roleplay with me over text multiple times. I've told her about this and she said it was fine as they both do it with other people and dont see it as cheating. 

After this interaction with her, I cant help but notice more stuff. Hes constantly telling her that is she were to die he would kill himself also. She constantly gives him the silent treatment, and she catcalls other guys in front of him. She often randomly tells me in explicit detail how he fingers her under the table, and how she lost her virginity in the school bathroom. After all these things kept popping up, I've tried to deal with it as we've been friends for years but I cant help but feel like I belong with other people. I would feel guilty for leaving and it's not like I have really anyone else to turn to. I have a couple other friends but most of them are friends with her too, and it would just be akward. I've tried to stop being friends with her in the past for different reasons, but every time I crawl back to her because I dont have anyone else to turn too.

After this though, I'm not sure if I'm being in an abusive friendship as well with her, and the relationship with the two is extremely toxic as they are both toxic themselves. I'm just not sure what to do.

Anyway, TL;DR my friend admitted she and her boyfriend are into ageplay, I'm disgusted and after this interaction I start to notice red flags in their relationship and in our friendship.",LittleKidLover12,2019-03-12 17:00:10,1,567,9.9,65.76,40.63,15.79,17.18,14.81,94.71,66.49,25.75,18.69,7.94,1.41,0,8.47,0.88,7.05,2.82,14.64,10.93,7.23,10.05,2.47,19.22,4.59,4.23,2.12,0.71,2.29,3.53,1.41,2.12,0.35,1.06,0.18,19.05,0.18,2.29,6.35,3,14.64,2.47,1.06,1.06,3.7,1.76,6,2.12,0.71,0.71,0.53,1.94,0.35,0.71,1.06,0,8.29,4.94,1.06,2.12,0.18,0.35,4.94,12.7,0.18,12.7,1.59,6.53,4.76,0.35,0.35,0.35,0,0,0.35,0.71,0,0,0.35,0.18,0.18,16.05,6,4.06,0,0.18,0.35,0.18,0,1.06,3.35,0.71,0.18
b0hkhz,Getting woken up,"So this is the most recent incident and I wanted to know what peoples opinions were. 

So I have a cat and she helps me with my depression massively, I can honestly say that I would not be here without her. Well tonight she was sleeping with me and wanted to go out at 2 o'clock ish I went and let her out- this isn't an uncommon thing to happen. 

I then went back to sleep and my mum bangged on my door and woke me up about an hour and a half later. This absolutly terrified me especially as I have anxiety and night terrors anyway. She shouted at me saying the cat was meowing and making the dog (who sleeps inside) bark. However I am always shouted at for 'being up and down all night with the cat' even if I only put outside once and tgen leave her. (She has a bed, food and water outside). I know she wanted to come inside because that is what happenes if she goes out after being in but she stops and just goes to bed pretty quickly.

Being woken up like this made me have a panic attack. Now I cant get back to sleep, I really want to hurt myself, and I will be shattered tomorrow and I have to ride into work.

b0hmaa,My Abusive Girlfriend,"So for context, this was my third relationship and my longest one as well. I've since been in several relationships and now only realize how bad it was. I also apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes in this ahead of time. 

 Me and her met via an online game, she was dating a dude at the time. Despite this she started flirting with me via messages, sometimes while we were playing games with her boyfriend or even in call with him(Discord). After at most a week she finally asked me if I was willing to join her relationship. Even then I was 90% sure I wasn't into dudes, but thought I'd try it at least once. Her boyfriend was chill and all, but his feelings for her faded and he left. She asked if I wanted to keep dating her in a mono-relationship and I said yes. 

 It was only after the first few weeks of it just being us dating that I slowly realized how bad it was. She wasn't in the best place mentally and would blame me for everything, and I mean everything. From her not being able to focus, to her losing a game, or her being upset. Somehow it was my fault. There were times she'd whine and spam me when I didn't want to play with her or talk to one of her friends, I was and still am pretty shy/timid so I knew that even if I joined I'd be pretty quiet and not really say anything the whole time(I'm also not super into PDA and she was).

 She later opened up to me telling me she was scared she was pregnant. I was confused since 1: we were both girls and 2: we were long distance. She spilled and told me that she had unsafe sex with some dude near her. I've always been really bad about forgiving people too much so I let her back in and forgave her, but it definitely shun some light one some of her other actions. She continued to yell and belittle me constantly and push me to give all of my attention to her from the time I woke up till I went to sleep. I was still in school and was in GED classes, I was trying to stay up with everyone else by studying and always focusing on Homework first no matter how tired I was. So her trying to distract me constantly wasn't helping. 

 Awhile later I had my first suicide attempt, I won't go into to much detail but a lot of the reasons was due to her. She constantly was over my shoulder, asking me about who I talked to to, where I was going, what I was doing, and constantly edging me to focus all of my attention and energy on our relationship. She ended up breaking up with me, but it wasn't clean. She blamed me for her life struggles once again and didn't even have the guts to call me and do it that way or talk to me afterwards. 

 She later came back several times, we'd get back together and then break up after only maybe a month. She semi-recently tried to do it again however I finally told her off. She hasn't tried to message me since and I am so happy. She had messed me up in the past and in my clouded judgement after her I made some bad decisions that I regret, nothing life ruining but it still haunts me to this day. This is actually my first time opening up about this online, and it'd be a lie if I said I wasn't nervous.",chained_tealeaves,2019-03-12 21:15:31,6,622,14.35,47.43,86.63,11.27,20.06,12.86,95.18,64.47,23.31,18.49,10.45,0.96,0,7.07,0,4.82,2.57,14.47,9.97,7.88,9.49,2.25,17.04,4.18,2.09,1.13,2.09,2.89,6.27,2.41,3.54,1.13,0.64,0.64,16.4,0.16,1.13,6.75,0.8,13.83,2.09,1.29,1.45,4.18,1.77,5.31,1.29,0.16,0.96,0.16,1.45,0.48,0.8,0.32,0,9.97,4.5,2.25,2.09,0.48,1.13,9.65,4.34,0.8,18.33,1.29,7.4,10.29,0.64,0.8,0.16,0,0,0.16,0.8,0,0,0.16,0.16,0,12.38,4.82,3.22,0.32,0,0,0,0.32,0,2.73,0.64,0.32
b0k5up,I need to get the things my father did off my chest,"I hope you don't have reddit, dad. I don't want to get in more trouble.

He has always had anger problems, but the thing I've thought a lot about the last few days. When me and my sister was little and we were on a car trip (we often went on these) alone with dad we usually played in the back seat to pass time (since a 5 hour car trip can get boring). Whenever we got a little loud he would tell us to stop. Fair enough, it's hard to drive for hours. So we went quiet for a while. Eventually we would start talking to eachother and he got so angry with us he would turn on the car radio and blast music so loud until he calmed down (usually about 10 minutes). Since the stereo was in the trunk we got all the sound from behind us, and after 10 minutes of metal music on max volume we had tinnitus for hours afterwards. This happened on multiple occasions, even if we would just ask him to pull over so you could pee or stretch your legs.

I don't know if it's justified that he often were in a mad mood when he was going to drive for a few hours, but we recently found out that muy sister has hearing problems, and I immediately thought of all those times when he blasted music on max in the car.

b0lwek,My girlfriend's family is being abused by her father and her mother is too afraid to do anything.,"So I don't know how to start this post. I've posted this before on another subreddit asking for help but I feel like this is different. It's more... personal. I just want to point out that I'm 17 and my girlfriend is 19. Both of us are or were victims of abuse. My story is different, and had some type of closure. My girlfriend's story on the other hand is still on-going. I'd like to point out the people and their ages in this post before continuing.

 

My girlfriend - K (19)

Her mother - M (46)

Her father - F (51)

Her aunt - A (46, the mother and the aunt are twins)

Her Sisters - S1 (11), S2 (16), S3 (8)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend for nearly 4 months now, though we've known each other for close to 3 years. We are long-distance at the moment (She lives in the UK and I live in Ireland), but I went to visit her on the 16th of February, we had a lovely time and will be meeting again shortly. Anyways, over the 3 years that I've known K, I've learned a lot about her and her family, including the fact that her father is both emotionally and physically abusive. Over the years he has beaten her mother, her sisters and her. At the age of 16, shortly after I met K, she ran away from home due to F. She went to live with her grandmother, but J often visited. J is aware of F's actions towards the family and has previously taken photos of K's fingers when F broke them in what he claims to be ""self-defense"". This happened because F was trying to break in through the bathroom door when S2 was trying to have a shower. K was 14 when this happened. K has since moved out from her grandmother's and now lives on the other side of the country at a university, far from F. I'm not sure of all the details from the past, but what I can tell you is what happened in the past few years. I'm not quite sure when any of these were done, so I'll simply list them:

• F beat K and her sisters whenever they did anything that he didn't like. Just last night, F tried to hit S1, and when she tried to defend herself, he claimed that he can hit her now in self-defense and no one will believe her, despite having three other people there to watch the whole thing happen.

• F has essentially brainwashed M into thinking what he does is okay. She claims that the only reason he hits her and the kids is because they are acting out when they shouldn't be. Whether it's fear or her genuinely thinking that it's okay, M doesn't want to do anything about his abuse.

• F threatened to cancel the sim card that he pays for K's phone, then order a new one and read the messages she has sent.

• F often comments on K's breasts and ass, saying that they are big, or look nice. This obviously makes her uncomfortable, which she has said to him but he continues to do so.

• After K cut her hair short, F flipped out and started calling her numerous insults, claiming she has ""ruined her looks"" and is now ""ugly beyond belief"". I think she looks quite nice with short hair, and so do many other people. He claims that women with long hair are the ""perfect women"" and must have long hair or they will be, in his words, ""unfuckable"". In my opinion, this is disgusting to say to anyone, especially to your daughters.

• When F found out that K had a boyfriend (myself), he proceeded to spy and stalk me to find faults. I am part of a Facebook group called 'Rate my Rollie', a meme group disguised as a group to rate people's roll-up cigarettes. He found this and began texting K, insulting me and threatening me saying that if he sees me, he'll punch me in the face. Bear in mind that I'm 17. He also continued by saying that I'm forcing K to smoke weed and do other drugs. Though I will admit that I do smoke weed, nothing within 'Rate my Rollie' has shown this. I have never posted in the group before then. I also never tried to convince K to smoke weed as I know she doesn't like drugs of any kind.

• A little while after that incident, F began claiming that I was lying to K about where I'm from due to my heritage. I myself see myself as Irish. I was born here, and I have lived here ever since. F claims that I'm Ukrainian because my parents are Ukrainian. He also claims that I live in Kiev (Despite only being to Ukraine once in my life, and that not even being close to Kiev) and that I'm lying to K about where I live.

• Shortly before I went to visit K, F was trying to convince her that I only want to come to steal her money and rape her. This may seem like a normal (though maybe a bit harsh) worry due to us meeting online and him never meeting me. However, due to who F is as a person, K and I know that he was only doing this to scare her and prevent us from meeting.

• M messaged J about F has done that night (I forget what it was, forgive me), J sent screenshots of the conversation to K. After K confronted him about it a few days later, he claimed that none of what M said is true, however his story kept changing. After this, he beat M for sending the messages to J.

• After this, he began messaging J threatening her to delete the screenshots. First he tried to force her into deleting them, then he claimed that the screenshots can't prove anything. However, after that he kept threatening J about the screenshots.

• F convinced M that because she isn't doing anything about him, she is effectively a ""passive bystander"", meaning that she'll go to jail too for his abuse. Though the rest of the family and I know that she is also a victim in this, M is fully convinced that she will be jailed if she reports him.

• After F left his job to work at a better one, he forced M to quit her job. He believes that ""women don't have the right to work"" and ""are only good for having children and raising them"". Truly disgusting.

• S3 has a disability that makes her both physically and mentally handicapped slightly. She's still a smart kid but it takes her more time to learn or do something than it would other children. K originally claimed that if S3 wasn't born, that F would continue to have children to receive money from the government for them. F himself has claimed that S3 is a ""gold mine"".

Ever since I found out that K's father was an abuser, I've wanted to do nothing but meet him and hit him. Of course, I never will because that would be just stooping down to his level.

b0n72e,I Didn't Want To Be Like Them,"Trigger warning: specific abuse mention


I never wanted to be like my parents. I specifically didn't want to be like my stepdad once I realized everything he did was abuse.

This morning I caught myself doing the exact same thing to my dog as he did to me: picked her up and threw her. I lost control. I was angry. I hit her some more. 

It's not the first time.

My doc hasn't refilled my meds the past week and I've been on edge but it is no excuse. The way she looked at me, so helpless, I just started crying. I'm exactly like him. I'm a horrible person. I'm a fucking hypocrite and I deserve nothing nice ever.  

Dog's fine, she was back and licking me after I started bawling. Then she played as if nothing happened, but I kept crying. I confessed to my husband everything and he didn't say a word, just hugged me.

b0nik3,My abusive brother,"My brother is going to be 17 this July and is possibly the most abusive person I know. I am 20 years old. He won't change, he won't let anyone or anything help him, and he won't take action towards stopping his addiction.

My brother has an addiction to adderall, acid and marijuana. I know some of you will think that's not possible with weed but when he is off of it, he is asshole x6. He isn't a pleasant person to be around.

The person he picks on most is my mom, who is 62. He always screams profanities at her if he doesn't get his way, throws shit at her, and threatens to hit her.

My mom won't call the cops on him because she doesn't want to ruin his life, when he is already ruining it by skipping school every day and becoming an addict.

Another thing my brother has done is steal my car and my girlfriend's car. He has stole mine twice, and has been lucky to come out alive after that (I was LIVID). He knows better than to steal my gfs car again saying she is ROTC and told him she'd kick his ass next time he did it. He has also stolen around 350 dollars worth of my money and 8k of my mom's. Yet, still no juvy for him.

It's clear my mom is the shining example of an abuse victim. And even though he knows better to not abuse me (I've taught him a lesson when we were kids by literally spraining his foot after he stole 100 dollars from me and called our mom a bitch,) he still abuses my mom whenever he gets the chance. Leaving my mom to doing whatever he wants, whenever he wants. And if he DOESN'T get it all hell breaks loose. 

I don't know what to do anymore. He threw some profanities at my mom today and a lamp at her face. He is a bright kid underneath all that macho, but chooses not to put that to use. And so, I'm at a loss.",jesscomplainz,2019-03-13 08:49:13,2,355,11.52,69.39,9.81,1,15.43,11.55,93.8,60.28,24.23,19.15,7.04,0.56,0.28,11.27,0,5.07,3.94,10.7,12.11,4.51,7.89,3.66,20.56,3.38,1.97,2.25,1.69,2.25,6.2,1.41,4.79,0.28,2.82,0.85,19.44,3.38,0.56,4.51,10.42,11.83,2.54,1.13,1.41,3.66,1.41,3.1,1.97,0.85,0.56,0.28,2.82,1.41,1.41,0,0,7.61,2.54,0.85,1.69,3.1,0.85,3.38,13.52,2.25,13.24,3.1,3.94,6.2,0.85,0.28,0,1.13,0.28,0.28,1.69,1.41,0.28,0,0,0,15.77,6.2,3.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.51,1.13,0

b0p6f9,I wanna die but I also don't. (Rant),"I know thats a stupid idea. I don't want to kill myself. I don't want to really walk into traffic. But the thoughts keep coming into my head and I hate them. Intrusive. 

My mom who used to care for me is turning more and more into my abusive step father. He hates me, and she knows this, but makes excuses for him and lies straight to my face that he doesn't. Does she think im a fucking moron??!! Hes a hateful asshole who knows that soon im finally gonna be out of his grasp and hes pissed as hell about it.

 Im cutting them both out of my life for a while once I'm gone. Weather my mom likes it or not, she made the mistake of letting him mentally and emotionally abuse me. Its her FUCKING fault that hes here. Its their fault that id rather die than live here any longer. She acts like she cares about me but if she really cared about me she wouldn't let him abuse me and my 15 yr old brother. 

I just wish I could snap at him. Scream in his fucking face just like he does to me. He fucking hates me, I even tricked him into admitting it once!! And she has the AUDACITY to tell me he doesnt hate me. 

I haven't self harmed since i was 13 or so but ive honestly thought about it. I am aware that that is fucking useless so i havent done it. Im aware that killing myself is also stupid, and i know that isnt what I really want.

 I just want to leave. I want this to be done, over. I don't want to hear them anymore. I hate them so much and I hate saying that about my mom but ive come to realize that its true. She doesnt do anything to stop him. Hes brainwashed her into thinking hes always in the right. I hate having to walk on eggshells around the house just to avoid getting yelled at. I basically have to change who i am just to survive. They don't know a Damn thing about me. 

Just hit me already, or maybe don't. I dont care anymore. If he does I can call the police.

b0tr5k,Strength to leave?,"Cross-posted in r/emotionalabuse.

For those of you who have left emotionally abusive spouses or significant others, how did you maintain the strength and clarity to leave?

I'm preparing to leave my relationship and worry that I'm not being fair to my partner in doing this, even though they have been emotionally abusive. My partner knows I'm upset after they screamed at me a few weeks ago that I was ruining their life, and we have talked about separating, but they keep trying to show me how much they care about me by buying gifts and suddenly having a 180 degree switch in attitudes towards things that have been important in our lives. I don't trust the new attitudes and don't feel safe. 

I've already been working with a therapist who has been supportive, and I can see how my life will improve after leaving, but I still feel like I could be destroying my life or like I'm making a mistake. It feels really disorienting and confusing.

b0uez4,My siblings found my journal.. what do?,"I writ a lot of things down. On paper, in a journal, just anywhere. How I'm feeling or what has happened to me. Recently my siblings found a journal of a list of things I hate.

Now let me explain my siblings. My siblings have put me through all kinds of torment throughout the years. Insults, beating me up, tormented me at my grandfather's wake. My sister insults me about something over practically every meal we ever went out for. ""You're eating wrong, why are you staring at me, oh my god you walk like an old lady, why do you twist the bread off like that that's weird just cut it, why don't you speak louder"" etc. My siblings tear apart everything I write and speak like  as if it was garbage.  They say things around me like ""oh you're gonna grow up a stripper"" ""You're gonna get pregnant before you get out of high school"" and make terrible remarks about my appearance. They knew I suffered from anorexia but on occasion insult my weight. They insult how I eat  as I stated earlier  ^. My sister told my grandmother I was a lesbian without my consent when I am NOT EVEN A LESBIAN!!!! She's made comments about me being a supposed lesbian and when I get upset she gets all offended like ""I just say these things to help you"" blah blah blah. They both see me as really immature. They do anything to rile me up. They invade my privacy any chance I can. They barge into my room by picking open the lock. They go through my notebacks and my dresser. They try to go through my technology. 

On the hate list, I mentioned my sister's insults as one of the things I hate listed. They ended up finding it. My brother read it to my sister. After my shower I came out and she confronted me. ""When have I EVER been mean to you?"" ""I've helped you with your essays!"" ""I bought you concert tickets"" ""I got you a Harry potter thing."" ""You don't appreciate me."" ""After all the things I do for you you don't appreciate it and think I'm mean."" ""How have I EVER been mean to you?"" 

I don't know what to do about this.

b0wtdk,My 20 year old friend is being physically abused by her parents,"The girl that lives across the hall in my dorm wanted to hang out for a while because she'd just gotten into a fight with her (in my opinion, overbearing) boyfriend that doesn't live here in our college town. After a while of talking she asked me if she could tell me something but I couldn't tell anyone, even my best friend and roommate. Took her a few minutes to get it out but she told me that she has been and still continues to be physically abused by both her parents. Last time she was home they actually caused her to bleed.

She broke down and started balling her eyes out. It honestly broke my heart. They're too controlling for her to get away. They said if she told the police they'd take her car and stop paying for her college. She's not allowed to get a job because that means she can save up to leave. They won't let her buy her car from them. She tried to tell her uncle to get him to help but he said ""that's normal every family is like that"". I've never personally met someone who's regularly physically abused, certainly not a 20 year old who lives at her college 3 hours from home, so this is all very new to me. 

It's incredibly upsetting. I'd love to catch the fuckers in the act but violence isn't the best response. Also she lives clear across the state from where I live. Her boyfriend is sensitive to her situation but I'm not sure what he's doing to help, I don't know much about him. I held her hands and gave her a much needed hug and I offered my support. I didn't know how to help so I just let her vent. Since she's an adult I'm not sure that the police could be of any help unless there's immediate evidence of domestic violence, even then she can already expect repercussions. The best I can come up with is suggest she open an account with another bank so she can get a job without them knowing. I'm going to see if our school has any resources for abuse victims.

If anyone has any insight on this or has a similar story I'd appreciate any help.",CplCaboose55,2019-03-13 23:12:15,0,394,24.84,78.44,10.44,25.77,17.13,13.96,96.95,60.15,22.84,17.77,6.09,0.51,0,9.64,1.52,5.08,5.08,13.45,11.17,5.08,6.85,3.05,21.57,2.79,1.52,1.27,0.76,2.79,6.09,3.05,3.05,0.25,1.52,0.51,21.57,1.02,1.27,8.88,1.78,14.21,1.78,2.03,2.54,3.55,1.78,4.82,1.52,0.76,0.51,0.25,3.3,1.02,2.28,0,0,9.9,4.57,1.02,4.06,2.79,0.25,5.08,13.96,1.02,12.94,1.78,5.58,5.58,3.05,0.25,1.52,1.02,0,0,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,0,13.71,5.58,1.52,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,5.58,0.51,0

She brings up my exes and it makes me feel guilty. I’ve also been having some serious issues with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts, and it’s hard for me to talk about it (as you may expect) with her. 

However instead of offering me support, I feel like she guilts me about it. I’m going to college next year, and she makes me feel like I shouldn’t and stay in state.

b1e3ce,Emotional abuse,"I just got back home after an hour of emotional and verbal abuse. 

It’s my fault that I keep coming back hoping for things to change. My fault for allowing it to continue.

When you love someone so much and you know they’re a good person but sometimes they take advantage of you and put you down. Say things to make you feel worthless. Try to make you feel like crap over and over.
They ask you questions and you try to answer it just to be shut down and told you’re a liar and you’re stupid and you ain’t shit.

I just sit there trying to defend myself and all I get back is over and over of how wrong you are and how much of a bad person you are.

How do you stop loving someone when you know what they’re doing to you is wrong but you still feel like you want to be with them.

Am i really stupid? How can I let this happen over and over?

How do I get through this pain of losing the person I love. The same person who can sit there and see you crying and hurting but still continue to mock you and blame you for your tears and your pain when he is the one causing it all.

b1fask,I need to help a friend.,"Hello. My best friend is 17 year olds, soon to be 18 and she is great in school. Her grades are usually 13 (out of 15) and she is class best. Yet, her family situation is terrible.

She often cried on my shoulder over her mom being disappointed of her. A few minutes ago she got her German grade. 8 points. This is by no means bad. It's a good grade. Any grade over 5 is good. But she started crying, saying her mom will lose it.

She talked about how her mom freaked out last time too, when she had only 8 points in maths. I helped her there too.

She told me her mom always yells at her. That her mom doesn't see her as a daughter, but only as good grades. She told me she wasn't planned and her mom hates her and prefers her brother.

Now, I know her mom verbally abused her. I put one and one together. She has spots all the time. Says it's from sports. This is only an assumption but I think her mother abuses her physically.

What can she do? She is at her end and I don't know what to do anymore.

b1gv7k,Advice: Considering seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist,"I am considering seeing either a psychologist/psychiatrist for the first time since I was sexually abused as a child by a close family member. 

The person is still in my life and I was able to move past the abuse until I had my own child. This person has access (very limited and supervised) to my child which makes me very uncomfortable.

My spouse also does not know about the abuse and I am worried their reaction will be violent (towards the abuser, not me) if/once they find out. 

I feel it is wrong to lie to my spouse about this but I believe it has to be handled correctly which is why I would like to see a professional. Additionally, I am very close with the abusers spouse and I believe that bringing this up will create huge issues within my family - they may even be in denial that it happened. 

Does anyone have any insight as to how this may unravel?

b1ira1,I'm in disbelief...,"&amp;#x200B;

tldr: My grandmother said, to my face, that it's not neglect when my father refuses to help his two homeless children until she has to FORCE HIM TO. It's not neglect when a 50 year old man has to be forced by his 80-90 year old mother to help his homeless children. I feel it's obvious, but what do you guys think of this?

Before I start, when I say homeless I don't mean living on the street. What I mean is we were hopping from hotel to hotel getting thrown around by DSS and my father's VERY, VERY inconsistent help. Often times me, my brother, my Mom, and our two cats would be in our car for many hours during New York winter, which, for those that don't know, is pretty damn bad. So we had a roof over our heads most of the time, but no home.

There's a lot going on right now. My Dad is a compulsive liar and control freak who's been mentally and verbally abusing my mother ever since they split up and we (me, and my brother) went with my Mom. She can't just ignore him because he left us when my Mom had no job and hasn't had a job for 15 years, due to having to take care of 3 children, 2 of which (one being me) are autistic. Since she hasn't had a job for so long no one will hire her, meaning she has to go to my Dad for money, and he lies saying he has no money, or his checks don't go through or whatever else to avoid helping us. Also, my Dad has been living with his parents since he left, barely paying any rent, and has very low bills (which my Mom knows since she did ALL FINANCIALS for the WHOLE TIME THEY WERE TOGETHER, yet his parents believe him when he says he has no money, as well as everything else he says, which is abusive lies about my mother. So now, with nowhere to go, we have to live with my neglecting father and his parents who support and enable all of his awful actions towards. With that background out of the way, here's what incited this post. In an argument with my Dad's mother, my grandmother, I asked her ""Is it neglect when my 50 year old father refuses to help his two homeless children until his mother FORCES HIM TO,"" which is what's been happening for months, since when my Dad refuses to help my Mom has to call his mom. My grandmother then had the gall to say to my face that it is NOT NEGLECT when my father REFUSES TO HELP HIS TWO HOMELESS CHILDREN UNTIL HIS MOTHER FORCES HIM TO! Her excuse, which she also said to my face, was that ""He has no money,"" but HE OBVIOUSLY HAS MONEY IF SHE HERSELF HAS BEEN HANDED THE MONEY AFTER FORCING HIM TO HELP US! I'm really pissed off about it and needed to vent so I made this account. Luckily, my Mom got a job at the hotel we were in before, but it might not even be enough to get us out of here. :(",jake134900,2019-03-15 12:00:35,9,544,22.3,85.27,30.94,2.68,25.9,11.4,94.85,60.29,22.43,16.91,6.99,2.21,0.18,7.17,0.37,5.51,2.76,14.71,10.11,6.07,7.35,3.12,17.28,1.84,1.1,3.86,2.39,1.29,4.78,1.1,3.68,0.18,1.47,1.1,22.06,5.7,0.18,4.96,7.72,10.29,1.47,2.39,0.55,2.02,1.29,3.31,1.47,0,1.29,0.18,1.47,0.92,0.55,0,0,9.93,4.6,0.18,5.33,0.74,0.37,4.41,11.4,0.74,13.97,1.47,4.41,7.9,1.29,0.55,0.37,2.02,0,0,1.1,0.55,0.37,0,0.18,0,16.54,3.49,6.62,0.18,0.37,0.18,0.37,0.18,0.74,3.12,0.92,0.37

b1t44q,Would this be considered abuse? Sorry if it's not and for the wall of text.,"Sorry for the following wall of text.

I figured mine was normal, but after talking to my wife about her childhood I don't think so.
My mom grew up in a very abusive situation and was in and out of foster care, so I grew up always hearing her constant horror stories of abuse and foster care.
When I was around 8 or younger she told me that I was a rape baby, who would have been aborted like the two pregnancies before me except she was further along than she thought. She said she was 50 dollars short and the only reason she didn't go back is because my dad stole her money. Mentally this messed with me quite seriously. She would give my sister ""ice cream days"" for when she would get depressed where they would take a day off from work and school to eat ice cream and hang out. I never had one despite being depressed more deeply and often than my sister was.
At some point my mom made this rule about lying and said that would be the only thing she would hit for, I think this is after she realized I was a liar, so perfect excuse to beat me. Even the smallest lie I would get slapped and spanked for. Her rule for spanking was it had to be your age directly on the butt in a row, no flinching or anything. Well I flinched, a lot, so a 10 hit spanking would jump up to well over 50 hits on the regular. I was really smart as a child and was testing on a high school level while in elementary school. So, instead of skipping me up as far as possible she had them skip one grade from 4th to 6th. She said it was because she wanted me to be able to develop socially, but I wasn't allowed to have friends which hindered me socially still. Later I found out that it was because my sister was about to fail, and she didn't want me embarrassing her by skipping past her. So I got bored in school, wouldn't do the work and ended up bring home A's, B's, C's, and the rare D's, while my sister would bring home D's and F's and if she brought home a C or better it'd be the biggest deal. I'd end up lying about what was going on in school, because at that age I didn't realize that I was doing it out of boredom from not being taught at the level I should have been. Since her rule for beatings was only for lies, needless to say I was getting beat regularly. I would flinch or she would miss and get the extra hits as stated previously and it would get to the point where I just started trying to block the hits. I don't bruise easily and never have, yet she managed to leave me with black and blue on my back, arms, and legs, regularly. I had to go to school year round in long sleeves and pants so nobody would see. My sister would dress me and threaten me on a near daily basis that if anyone saw my bruises or if I told and we ended up in foster care, she would beat me too. She was in boxing at the time and was already using me as her punching bag and I was small and wasn't allowed to hit back, so I was scared of her too. These beatings would lasted around 6 years, until I started working and having to walk to and from work after school. As I'm typing this I realize it's because there was no time to beat me and no way to hide the bruises from my coworkers. I also now know that my mom prefers daughters over sons, which explains why my sister's mediocrity would be praised no matter what. My sister had no reason to lie, since no matter what she did it would be praised, so she never got beat.

TL;DR
At around 8, I was told that I was a rape baby and the only reason I wasn't my mom's 3rd abortion was 50 dollars. After that I was beat by my mom regularly for lying until I was 15 and started working. The beatings would leave me black and blue everywhere except hands, chest, and head. I wasn't allowed to tell under threat of more beatings from my older sister (she was the favorite, could do no wrong, and was never beat).",justathrowaway2045,2019-03-16 07:38:54,13,781,25.39,31.79,60.11,6.92,22.97,11.91,91.81,61.84,17.8,13.44,8.96,0.13,0.13,3.97,0.26,4.35,4.1,14.72,12.04,6.79,9.35,3.07,21.25,5.38,2.94,1.41,1.41,0.64,4.74,1.54,3.2,0.64,1.54,0.77,10.63,2.56,0.13,5.89,0.26,12.42,1.92,2.18,3.84,2.18,1.02,3.46,1.66,0.9,0.64,0.26,1.79,0.77,0.38,0.51,0.38,9.35,1.66,2.43,4.61,1.41,0.77,9.22,7.04,0.13,16.01,1.79,7.94,6.66,2.69,0,0.38,0.38,0,0,0.38,0.13,0,0,0.26,0,12.16,4.23,4.23,0,0.13,0.13,0,0,0.26,2.94,0.26,0

She thinks I should be more vague. I thought by going into detail, and taking accountability for each thing that I did wrong it might bring my ex some peace. I know everyone is different... and I’m wondering what is best. What would you prefer to hear in an apology from an ex abuser? Tips or advice would be helpful. All I want to do is take accountability, express remorse, and show the changes I have made.",my0cardialinfarcti0n,2019-03-16 09:42:24,4,197,46.04,60.03,71.26,7.91,10.94,16.24,95.94,56.35,20.81,14.21,12.18,0,0.51,1.52,0,6.6,5.08,13.2,14.72,0,5.08,0,24.87,7.11,4.06,1.52,0,2.54,7.11,2.54,4.06,0,1.52,0.51,15.23,0,1.02,0.51,1.02,12.18,2.54,2.03,2.54,3.55,2.03,1.02,1.52,0.51,1.02,0,0.51,0,0,0,0.51,12.69,3.55,1.52,4.06,3.55,1.52,5.58,12.18,2.54,12.69,3.55,5.58,4.06,1.02,0.51,0,1.52,0,0,2.54,0,0,0,0,0,15.23,10.15,2.03,0,0,0.51,0,0,0,2.54,0,0
b1uxh1,I want revenge.,"My mum had this boyfriend, who I’ll just name D. D would drink often, and get really angry and wreck our house and beat my mum and my sister up. He was also extremely homophobic and racist, one night he was so drunk he was stumbling around and he slurred at me: “Why do you kiss girls? That’s disgusting.” Their relationship ended earlier this year after he tried to attack me, and I haven’t been able to sleep since because of the trauma, and now I need to go to therapy. I know this is the wrong thing to do but I want revenge, since he ruined my life. I tried to press charges but I was underage (I was 15, 16 now).If anyone has any advice for what I can do then please respond. I’m sorry if this comes across as bitchy but it was seriously worse than it sounds, after the attempted attack happened he was escorted away by the police and then he came back at 9am (I only got 3 hours of sleep) and knocked on my door until he fell asleep on my doorstep. I was home alone since my mum was at work, I had to sneak out and go to my friends house because he was still drunk and violent, he got let back into the house because he went to my mums work and harassed her for the keys. So yeah, if anyone has any advice for what I can do to get revenge, it would be appreciated. He no longer has contact except over text, and I know I should just let the situation die, but why should I let him tear apart another family? Why should I let him get let off with it?",notclays,2019-03-16 10:31:06,18,298,13.21,42.03,46.47,1,22.92,10.4,93.29,64.09,21.81,16.44,10.07,0.34,0.34,5.37,0.34,5.37,2.35,13.09,12.75,6.38,10.4,0.67,19.46,4.36,2.35,2.01,1.34,1.01,6.71,1.01,5.7,0,3.02,1.01,12.42,2.01,1.01,2.35,5.37,12.75,1.01,3.02,3.69,2.68,0.34,4.03,0.67,0,0.34,0.34,2.68,1.01,0.67,0,1.01,8.39,2.35,2.01,2.01,1.68,0.67,7.72,10.4,1.01,14.43,2.35,6.38,6.38,1.01,1.34,2.35,0,0,0.34,0.67,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,13.09,3.69,4.7,0.34,0,1.01,0,0,0.67,1.34,1.34,0

b1wrhb,Should I dig up the past?,"Throughout the years something unexplainable has been haunting my soul and its been causing periodic times of sadness that may or may not be related to me. Just typing this is causing me great stress even though I have no recollection of any events happening. The issue is in regards to two molestations that may be connected, though I have zero actual evidence to support it.

The first molestation is in regards to a long ago best friend that I had as a child. It became made aware to me many years later, from a girl who was in and out of both me and my best friends lives, (she was both of our girlfriends at different times) that he was molested by someone close. I was in complete shock, it hit me like a ton of bricks even more so was the fact that she kept asking me if I was molested as well, I had zero knowledge of any of this happening. I swore up and down that nothing ever happened to me and she couldn't believe me. I was not given any other information from her out of respect as she said it wouldn't be right by my old best friend to reveal that kind of information to me.

The next possible molestation is in regards to my brother. My brother has had a rocky life, he has struggled with drugs and alcohol over the years and it didn't become aware to me why until he had a mental breakdown one night. I sat with him for hours just holding him as he cried. A lot of his talk was incoherent but the thing that stood out to me most was that he kept saying ""I was just trying to protect you"" over and over again. When I confronted my mom about something that may have happened to my brother she said he would talk to me about it when he was ready. 

My brother also had friends with my best friend's older brother (their middle child, they had three boys, I was best friends with their youngest) around the same times as me, that's the only connection I can make between these two really bizarre accounts that somehow seem related to me. My biggest gut feeling that these molestations are connected is that both me and my brother spent a lot of time with this family throughout our childhood so for me this family seems to be the key to this disgusting mystery.

Now I don't want to jump to conclusions, coincidences do happen and like I said I actually have zero evidence on my own part that these things happened but the fact that I am somehow a victim or bystander to these crimes even though I have no memory is tearing me apart. Its been well over 10 years since this information was brought to me and I know good and well whoever committed these crimes is still out there living his or her happy little life and it fucking sucks that no justice has come of it. I think that's what fires me up most I can't stand this sort of thing and if nothing was brought to the law WHY???

So, should I finally get to the bottom of this and dig up this old nasty skeleton possibly even get the law involved or should I just keep the waters still and forget this ever happened? If you have any other questions ask and I will try my best to answer.",OpenInteraction,2019-03-16 13:14:00,2,594,24.06,30.08,73.39,20.66,28.29,15.82,94.78,63.13,22.9,13.8,9.6,0.34,0.34,3.03,0.51,9.09,4.21,13.97,10.77,6.4,6.9,2.02,18.35,4.55,4.04,1.18,1.52,2.53,5.39,2.53,2.86,0.34,0.67,0.34,9.76,1.52,1.01,1.52,3.03,15.49,4.04,1.18,1.68,5.72,1.35,3.7,1.01,0.17,0.67,0.17,1.52,0.34,1.01,0.17,0.17,8.25,2.69,1.52,4.21,1.68,0.17,7.58,8.75,0.84,12.12,0.67,5.56,5.89,0.51,0.51,0.34,0.34,0.17,0,0.84,0.34,0,0,0.51,0,8.08,3.03,1.85,0,0,0.84,0,0,0.34,1.35,0.67,0
b1yo8k,I was beat and thrown out into the snow,"I don’t know where to begin. My dad says he doesn’t hit me or abuse me. When anyone asks did you ever get hit, I always say yes and he’ll be like I never hurt you unless you gave me a real REASON. Because he never hurt me that bad. I got to a point where I shrugged it off and agreed, but last night was a reminder. It might not happen often, but when he’s drunk the true feelings he holds comes out. He gets mad at me, yells, blames me for his problems, tells me if I was better..., brings up stuff about the war or just some shit that he ends up keeping me downstairs until 5 AM after getting home from the bar at 1 AM. 
Well last night I decided to show him something on Instagram that my sister claims”people want to jump me for” (she abuses me too she beats me up knowing I’m weaker, to the point where 3 weeks ago I had a seizure) she said “you REALLLY don’t want me in your life? Whenever I see someone jumping you I’ll just let them kill you instead of jumping in since you don’t need me” but I don’t “need her to fight for me because violence isn’t the answer and I don’t want to see her with an assault record” 
Anyways I show him the post and he’s PISSED! But idk, I trusted him to not treat me bad not judge me not hurt me allll that. Well he got my and took my phone. I let him have it then I grabbed it and he lunged at me and I was in his arms just wrapped up so I smacked the edge of my phone on his face because I didn’t wanna he held like that over a phone. He grabbed me and threw me to the ground (I fell on my recently busted head and now the scar is swollen) he kept choking me and saying “stand down” “stand down” but how do you stand down when someone’s on top of you trying to kill you? Last time my sister said “it’s done” she let me loose all my strength and kicked busted head into the ground causing me to have a seizure so I didn’t want to quit fighting for myself. but anyways he kept throwing me and hurting me the only thing I could do was grab his balls and twist  that pissed him off. He began kicking my chest and chocking and twisting his foot on my esophagus, he got to the point where he had me screaming saying “STAND DOWN AND ILL STOP” But HOW DO YOU STOP SCREAMING WHEN YOURE GETTING ATTACKED LIKE THAT. My sister walks in and pushes him off of me and says “DAD YOURE GONNA KILL HER!” And so he stopped grabbed me by my hair and threw me out. It was okay at first I was gonna walk to my boyfriends moms house. But it starts snowing and I’m in shorts and a tee shirt. So I come home try to
Open the door and the bottom part to where I can’t twist it is locked. As always when they kick me out. So I’m outside in the snow and rain until I’m like fuck my car has to be open. It was not. So I try his car and it was and I stay in there shivering. My sister ends up getting into my dads car and is like “bro we were going to go look for you come inside!” And I said “y’all didn’t care y’all left me in the snow and rain for an hour! And locked the bottom lock!” Then they say “WE DIDNT DO THAT STOP LYING!” But why would I be outside? In the rain? In the snow? Chilling in my dads car? When I can be inside a perfectly warm house if I could get in? Idk I told my boyfriend and he told his mom she picked me up and told me to leave his house ASAP! and to come with them. But I forgot I was leaving to my papas house on Monday for a trip of just me and him. So idk I don’t know if I should live there and drop all my college courses or try to get them online and live out there, because I’m DONE. I’ve been dealing with this since I was 8 being told “it’s not abuse because it’s not constant and I wouldn’t hit you if you didn’t deserve it” soooo yeah! Idk is this abuse? Am I going crazy? I don’t know what to do either. This is the 4 or maybe 5 time since 2017 this has happened and I’m done. I’m getting beat up by my sister to the point where my hips broke once, and she’ll tell people that proudly and my dad just gets drunk and let’s his frustration out on me but I’m done. I don’t know what to do I don’t want this anymore I’m worth more, but I don’t know what to do with school and housing I’m scared of not having anything and idkidk.

b20mv0,I think I can still feel the weight of his body on me.,"Sorry if this post is a mess, currently it's 3 AM and I should be sleeping, but I really wanted to share. Also, sorry if I make any mistakes, English is not my firs lenguage.

&amp;#x200B;

So, now I'm going out with a guy that it's very gentle and always listens to me. We are not anything serious but his personality has lead me to tell him things I almost haven't talked about with my closest friends.

This aslo brought back some memories of my relationship with my ex. We were together for 3 years +, and although he never touched he did wreck me mentally. I still have some issues with my self worth and confidence, but I think I can say I've dealt with almost everything.

But there is this incident that now I can't get out of my head. We were like other nights in his house, watching a film, eating pizza and drinking. I remember being drunk, and so was he. When time came to go to sleep I just wanted to close my eyes and doze off, but he didn't. It began with a simple kiss, which I was happy about. But then it went on and on, he was on top of me. One of his hands was getting under my shirt and the other one was trying to get between my legs, I didn't want it. I told him several times ""no"", it sounded soft due to my drunken and tired state, but I was saying it. And he was ignoring it. I began to panic, like really panic, I didn't understand why he was ignoring me, I even excused it in my head thinking he is not hearing me. But when his hand went inside my panties and started rubbing I finally reacted with more strenght, and I managed to push him off me.

I had to almost threw him off the bed to make him stop, my words weren't enough, me crossing my legs wasn't enough, I had to almost threw him off the fucking bed.

After that I imagened he would realise what just happend was wrong, and that he would apologise. That was my mistake, he got angry, yelled at me, called me frigid and a slut at the same time, then went to his side of the bed, lied down and turned his back to me. I was in disbelief, and asked him if he was serious. No answer of course, he had decided for the silent treatment (it wasn't the first time).

The worst part is that I wasn't angry, nor a little bit mad, just sad, feeling like the worst shit on the Earth. I was to tired or drunk to even try to my house, it was also too late to think about walking back on my own. I just laid there, next to him, crying. I keept telling myself that the next day he was going to apologise for sure. Again, my mistake. 

The next day he treated me like crap, and practically kicked me out of his house. 

I didn't break up with him, we were together for a year and a half more. During this time the mental abuse continued, he was always shaming me for not being passionate enough or for not having enough sex. He made me feel so guilty that I ended up having sex with him just to please him, even if I didn't want to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm proud to say that in the end I was able to see all the things wrong in the relationship, and was able to leave him. 

Sometimes I'll catch myself thinking ""gosh, why were you so stupid, why did you let it happend"", but I know it wasn't my fault.",cryptic_blue_alien,2019-03-16 19:44:38,4,645,17.36,15.67,82.09,1,18.43,10.54,94.42,63.26,23.72,18.29,11.63,0.62,0.31,5.74,0,5.43,3.88,13.02,10.08,6.67,7.29,3.26,20.16,5.12,1.86,1.09,0.93,1.4,6.2,1.4,4.81,0.47,1.55,0.62,10.39,0,0.31,0,5.89,13.8,2.17,1.24,2.17,2.79,1.09,5.89,3.26,0.62,1.24,1.4,4.19,2.02,0.31,0.78,1.09,5.74,1.71,1.4,1.55,0.78,0.93,9.92,6.98,0.78,14.73,2.48,5.58,6.82,0.47,0.78,0.93,0.16,0,0,0.78,0.62,0,0,0,0,17.67,5.43,7.13,0,0.62,0,0,0,0.62,2.79,0.31,0.78
b21vs7,I have just come to the conclusion that my abuser will never feel bad for what he has done.,"Ive been with the same guy for almost 4 years. In the beginning it was amazing! He treated me so well and we got along perfectly. As time had gone on, our relationship began to slowly deteriorate. Something happened about a year into the relationship. He had sex with me while i was asleep, with no condom. I woke up and pushed him off. That was only 2 months after i had given birth to a son that we had placed for open adoption, i was still grieveing.(and still am).
 I wasnt ready to have sex yet. I just didnt want to.  I shouldve left then, but i stayed because we had just gone through a huge loss with our baby boy and i felt like i needed him because i felt like he was the only one that could help me.
Then he had done that one more time. Then he molested me in my sleep. Then he head butted me so hard it knocked me off my feet and the same night he puched a window so hard it broke. (He gave himself stitches in the procces and a weekend stay in jail). After every single one of these moments i shouldve left. 
Part of me stayed because i felt like i needed him. Part of me stayed because i felt he needed me. Part of me stayed because i felt like i didnt have anyone else.
Part of me stayed because i didnt want to be homeless again. 
Part of me stayed because i felt like no one would love me like he had in the past.
I thought he could change and i thought he loved me. 
Everytime i had tried to talk to him about how much i have been Hurting and how this makes me feel he throws shit in my face bringing up the past and how I've hurt him. He says sorry but ive told him it doesnt mean anything, that he needs to show me he is sorry. 
He says i over react and that im dumb for thinking this way or i need to take a chill pill. Im always made out to be being a bitch. He makes me feel like my feelings dont matter!
 I am so sick of it! I have come to the awful conclussion that this boy does not or ever loved me. He does not care about what hes done. he will NEVER change. 
The thing that really just gets me is that he has never actually admitted he has done anything wrong. He refuses to beleive he is an abuser. He will Never admit to himself that he has done some really horrible things to me. 
He will NEVER feel sorry for what he has done no matter how many times he actually says those 2 teensy words. I cant take it any more. I am so sick of fighting to try to make him understand. To make him see what he has done and for him  to make it right. Tonight ive finally made the decision to leave and never look back. This situation with him has made me so unbeleivably confused. Im extremely Deppressed. Its going to take alot of therapy to undo (if thats possible) everything that i feel.

b227p6,Was I abused?,"Hi all. I have never been able to talk about experiences I had as a child with anyone, but I've always known to an extent my family was dysfunctional. I just need to know if specific things I am going to list are considered abusive, because I feel like a fraud calling it that now. These are all things my dad did.

1. giving me a sex toy when I was 13
2. showing me pornography at around 11-13
3. talking to me about sexual things throughout my childhood (infrequent)
4. being asked to shower with him
5. him taking his clothes off around me and showing me his penis
6. talking to me about other sexual things

So apart from those things of a sexual nature, these are some other things that have happened:

* threatening me with physical violence (such as killing or otherwise hurting me)
* Yelling for hours at least four times a week at my mum and myself
* telling me he hated me
* throwing/breaking things
* threatening to kill himself
* making up lies about my mum/telling me things to make her sound like a bad person
* he would often be paranoid about something that wasn't real; for example, he would tell me that my mum was cheating on him, that aliens might come and kill us, that our neighbours were poisoning trees in our backyard, that he might die on a top secret mission for the government, life threatening illnesses... really random things that scared me at the time
* after my mum broke up with him, he came to our house and told us that he was going to take us to Dreamworld (theme park). We had to turn around and come back when we were halfway there which was really disappointing. Came to find police at our house, and found out he was trying to kidnap us
* He stole our car

There's a lot more to list but it's hard to think of off the top of my head. I should probably also mention that when I was around eight he became addicted to drugs, but I didn't know this until I was a lot older, so I wasn't exposed to drugs per se.

b2air0,My boyfriend did something a sexual abuser has done in the past.,"Hi everyone, not sure if this is the right subreddit group, I apologize if it isn’t! To preface this, let me say my (33f) boyfriend (30m) of about 3 months is aware of sexual abuse in my past, not so much details but just that it happened. There have been times when I’ll fall asleep before him (I’m an incredibly light sleeper) and wake up to him masturbating. Whatever, that’s totally normal, right? I would much prefer him to wake me up for sex but I’m not the masturbation police. But last night, he turned down sex from me and I woke up to him masturbating. Do I tell him it makes me uncomfortable because it reminds me of the uncle that sexually abused me? Do I let it go? A huge part of me knows he would never want me to feel uncomfortable but I wouldn’t even know how to bring this up.

b2b5ef,How can I deal with my abusive and psychopathic brother living with me?,"To start off, I am about 16 years old right now and my brother is 7 years older than me so he is 24. From childhood, I remember him being one of my worst abusers and him hitting me, tackling me, taunting me and constantly berating me and verbally abusing me calling me a fatass, retard, fugly, etc. and I couldn’t even defend myself as I was only a child while he was in his late teens, nor did my parents do anything about this and being in an already abusive, toxic and dysfunctional family/household did not help this. He was partly to blame for my early suicidal thoughts and later my PTSD, I remember my first suicide attempt being at 8 years old and my mom and brother ended up finding the note and they just laughed and taunted me for it. Later on during my pre teen years he ended up enlisting in the marines and being stationed abroad to Syria and other countries, this was the biggest breath of fresh air for me as I felt like I could relax for once without his torture since he was no longer here and eventually I grew to somehow forget most of the abuse from him and thought I could finally forgive it. He would visit sometimes for holidays and so forth when they’d allow him and he seemed a lot better as a person since he wouldn’t bother me, I thought he grew and stopped being immature but sadly I was completely wrong because he got worse. Fast forward to now, he was married and was living with his wife but unsurprisingly it seems like he revealed his true colors to her while i was living almost calmly, because she vented to me about him being completely psychopathic, controlling, saying he called her horrible names and even choked her. I was extremely concerned and angry but... unsurprised at this. I still consoled her and told her to leave him and call the authorities if he tries something. Now they are divorced and I’m happy for her but this only seemed to make it harder for me, since he moved back into my household with my mom. Just only days after he became comfortable he started showing his true colors once again, he started by calling me a whore, stripper, slut and accusing me of having an older boyfriend out of nowhere just to embarrass me and make me feel bad. He even bragged countless times about the amount of people he killed in Syria during combat, he had no emotions saying it and even seemed proud of it, which in turn was extremely terrifying and disgusting to me. As time passed after some months it turned into him calling me every name in the book, mainly a monster, parasite, ugly, saying that I will go nowhere in life and that I am weak and stupid, all in front of my mom which she didn’t do anything about. Not only that but when I was around him at times he would constantly tackle and touch me for no reason despite me saying stop and telling him to leave me alone, once he even choked me in front of my mom to the point where I couldn’t breathe and then days later he tackled me and touched my breast, he said it was on accident but told my mom that he “didn’t know I had those” which makes me think it was on purpose and it made me feel so disgusted and violated. He even started abusing my dog similarly and saying that he is ugly and that he should die, purposely taunting him to make him cry and even hitting him on occasions, and I felt so scared to go into the room to defend him because I could barely defend myself and it’d just make the abuse worse. This spiraled into him constantly saying that I should die, that he wants me dead and is going to/wants to kill me, describing how he would in detail and saying that he’d choke me and my dog to death while we sleep, he would even say this to my mom countless times on purpose very loudly so I could hear and feel upset. All of these events pretty much triggered a good amount of memories from childhood that I’ve repressed that involved how he abused me constantly as a child and this made me feel even more terrified and extremely tired of having to deal with abuse once again. Just a few weeks ago my mom yelled at me for something small and my brother heard and joined in as usual saying that I was stupid and not going anywhere in life, so I said “Look at you, you’re only 24 and divorced and you’re still here” in attempts to defend myself and because I was tired of hearing the same words constantly. Almost immediately after that he ran to the bathroom I was in and smacked me extremely hard and I was terrified, I yelled at him that I would call the police on him for that and ran to my room to get my phone and he went after me and tackled me. At that point I thought he was going to kill me then and there, he had this same cold and empty terrifying look in his face that I remembered from when he’d lash out at me as a child. He took my phone so I just ran out in the cold crying and scared, just wanting to escape from that situation and from him. My mom ended up running after me and taking me in her car and to a hotel for the night because I was scared of coming home. She gaslighted me and manipulated me about the abuse as usual but then convinced me that he signed a contract to leave to the marines and be stationed in Afghanistan eventually and that telling the authorities would ruin her and my brothers career, I was already scared at the possibility of foster care being worse so I did end up going back with her. I came back home with her a day later and weeks have passed since then but despite what happened he still hasn’t stopped constantly making remarks about me and saying that he wants to kill me, I’m terrified of the situation escalating even further and of him doing something even worse to me so I do as much as possible to stay in my room and never be around or talk to him, I ignore everything he says but it still hurts me. I also can't stop getting constant flashbacks to what happened and experiencing the same horrified feelings of what I felt the moment it was happening. I don’t have anyone at all to turn to in case you want to know, I am planning on just being away as much as possible when I start going to actual school again (I am online schooled) and I’m waiting for him to finally leave.

b2bf8u,This is everything.Advice please.,"This gets heavy and is pretty long, so here is your warning

When I was born, my parents noticed I had a hard time learning in school and in general; however I was a sweet girl, so it was all okay....I struggled a lot in school and was 2 years behind my age group, it didn't help that I got bullied at school for being stupid, and at home too by my 2 older brothers. Both of my brothers excluded me in anything they could and were both extremely abusive, mentally and physically (hitting, choking, drowning, and threatening to kill me ), and one of my brothers sexually abused me for five years.

&amp;#x200B;

My father could be mentally abusive sometimes when he was teaching me something, and if I didn't understand it he would grow agitated and start raising his voice, insult me and sometimes smack me (usually when he was a bit drunk). I grew a bit scared of my father during that time. However, he was nice for the rest, so I thought it was because I was a terrible child and I was lucky he was forgiving.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents made so so many appointments with doctors and psychologists to discover what was wrong with me, that's when they found out I had dyslexia and ADD. I also had a small speech impediment and had a hard time with the three languages I was taught.

&amp;#x200B;

I was and still, am ashamed of my learning disabilities. Soon I took Ritalin for it, and my school performance improved. When I was 10, we moved again to another country, the brother who sexually abused me moved with us, and the eldest stayed behind.

&amp;#x200B;

In the new country, I was severely bullied for almost 4 years. I became better at school but struggled a lot. My parents fought more, and I had to stop them and smooth thing out with them. My mother became depressive. The brother no longer sexually abused me but became an addict and started growing physically abusive sometimes. I was bullied every day by classmates and 2 teachers. I had no friends and started gaining a lot of weight. My father would shame me when I complained about my life saying how good I had it.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 12 I tried to commit suicide by jumping off the apartment we lived in; however, my cat was looking at me, and for some reason, I couldn't do it. Around the time I turned 13, I started to realize what my brothers had done to me, especially the sexual abuse and it took a colossal impact on me. I grew ashamed of myself and became depressive.

When I was 13 I tried to overdose on sleeping pills and muscle relaxation pills, it was a failed attempt.

4 months later I tried drowning myself, but I couldn't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I met T, my first real friend. She was the first person I told about everything, and she too was sexually abused, but her family blamed her for it. Her family was messed up, and T was very abusive, shaming me, playing mind games and such.

( I don't blame her, she was so damaged, but T I am so thankful for the good times, I hope you are doing well)

A few months after being friends with T, a boy N who I had a crush on for 2 years confessed to me and hung out with me, I felt so happy, but I was just practice. 2 days after he had confessed to me he told me I was practice for the confession he told his crush. Again the shame of being used almost killed me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 14, I met my first boyfriend F, he gave me so much hope but I went crazy. T didn't like that I had someone else in my life than her and left me. I was alone with F, F was sweet, but I was crazy. The girls at school slut-shamed me and made stories to make him break up with me, 2 months later he broke up with me. I was heartbroken, but also numb.

Then we moved to another country, during that time my brothers made a mess out of their lives, dropping out, being addicts, and fucking up in general. I wanted to help them, and convinced myself I loved them. My parents vented their anger onto me and became controlling to prevent me from becoming like them.

&amp;#x200B;

In the new country, I became an only child and got my wonderful dog who I am so grateful for. I started the IB (international baccalaureate curriculum) because I felt some need to prove myself and thought my parents would love me more.

&amp;#x200B;

The IB really took a lot out of me, and my self-esteem went down. I tried to kill myself due to the stress by overdosing, but again it failed. I also tried cutting my thighs to bleed to death, but I wanted to live for my dog because she is my joy in life. I slept less, only studied, worked and became more depressive.

&amp;#x200B;

Both my brothers often visited, and once when my brother was beating my dog I attacked him, I was almost sent to the hospital for what he later did to me. My mother told me I was looking for a fight, so it was my fault for what he did to me, but that he should still apologize, he didn't. Later both my brothers watched me shower, and I felt so disgusted, I told my parents, but they said it was a joke and to stop overreacting.

&amp;#x200B;

My father mocked me about my weight a lot, which turned me to turn bulimic, he knew and said I had to eat more vegetables. He shamed me for my weight and for what I was doing, I started starving myself, and he got angry, I don't have the time to join a sports team because of all the time I spent on my IB.

&amp;#x200B;

Around the time I got a new friend R, R was a party girl who would often call me in the mornings to pick her up from bars, and she is very manipulative. One day I told R I needed to party (I wanted to forget all my problems like her), she said she would take care of me, instead she hooked up drunk 16 years old me with a stranger who went to have sex with me, I was unconscious for the most part and was too out of it to stop it. I tried to kill myself the next day by getting hit by a car, I felt disgusted but couldn't traumatize someone to kill myself. I got myself tested, and thank god I wasn't pregnant or had any STD's, my parents helped me but told me it was my fault. R said sorry but would often joke about it, I still hate myself for it and can't trust her. I sometimes blame her, but I know it was my fault.

&amp;#x200B;

I got another friend M, who was adopted and very racist (said that white people will always oppress her black people) when I told her about my issues she said I should be grateful to be white and not black and adopted like her. She would sometimes hit me and left me. I spent more time with R since she was helping me, but M shamed me for leaving her, M is now away from school getting help, (M if you ever read this, I hope you got help).

&amp;#x200B;

Around this time my mother got breast cancer, and I was left to take care of her. My brothers got worse, and became more abusive towards me, my two old childhood friends also got worse, one of them got Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and other epilepsy, they cut connections with me, and I felt terrible.

After a while, my mom got better and tried to bring the family together, I confessed to my parents about what my brothers did to me since they were planning on setting me on a cruise with them sharing a bed and room. My parents helped me and told my brothers. The eldest brother broke off the relationship with me and still hasn't spoken to me for 2 years; I am okay with that. The other brother is trying to improve his life and get along with me, but I am not ready for any of it. My parents are pushing me to live a normal brother-sister relationship with them.

&amp;#x200B;

NOW that takes us to now. I am now 18 years old; soon I'll be taking my final exams and hopefully graduating. I have already applied to universities, and will soon hear if I got accepted. Now here comes the part I need help with.

I am not happy.

I don't know if I want to keep living. The past always haunts me, and I feel broken. I feel unworthy for love and disgusting, I haven't touched alcohol since the day it went wrong, and the university has a lot of that. I am afraid. I am lost.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? should I take a gap year to find myself, or got to university?

What should I do about relationships? I have huge trust issues and am disgusted with myself.

What should I do about my brother?

I still feel stupid and can't stop hating myself.

I still want to kill myself, but I want to become a mother, but I hate myself too much.

I am so lost, and confused.

This is everything of me, please can you help me?

&amp;#x200B;

b2dcxp,I’m not sure if this counts as abuse or not...,"When I was 12 I got my first period. My Mom wasn’t big on giving “the talk” so I was really left to my own devices. Well one day my stepdad offered to tell me about whatever I wanted to know—periods, anatomy, life, and even sex...

So he had texted me (on Kik) while I was at my friends house and after a bit of texting he made some comment that sounded provocative, so I asked him about it. I don’t specifically remember the comment, but I remember the convo moving to a point where I asked if he had considered sleeping with me. He said yes. So when I went home from my friends house that day, he made some moves on me. He always asked if “I wanted it” but really I had just been so excited to finally have sex in general I don’t think I cared who it was with. We would text on whatever app we could. On a specific day he would stay at work late, so I would always stay up to fool around with him.

When I got my first boyfriend (long distance) I told him I didn’t want to anymore because it felt like cheating. He kept telling me that it “didn’t matter” because “he lives so far away” and that since he was cheating on his wife I should cheat on my boyfriend. Eventually I gave in to his consistent pleas for me to sleep with him.

I ended up getting another boyfriend about this time last year. And this time I was very persistent about not sleeping with him, and again he pleaded, even though he continuously said “we can stop whenever you like”. I kept refusing, so he got creative. “Let’s just cuddle” which tuned into naked cuddling. He would offer to give me a back massage and then he would rub my butt/try to finger me. Whenever we were alone in the same room he would touch me or grind against me.

If I wouldn’t have sex with him for more than a week, he would beg me to. Or beg me to touch him. One time he started crying begging me to suck him off. What’s happened more recently is every time he walks past me he grabs my tits/ass.

If I go around the house in shorts or bra/tank he stares at me. He’ll text me and tell me how much he wants to sleep with me.

I don’t know if I can say I was/am sexually abused or not because it’s been “consensual” but I’m not sure if that’s me or him talking in my mind

b2dlya,What can I do?,"I’m not sure if this qualifies here because it happened in the past, but here I go:

About three to four years ago I had a boyfriend (now an ex) who mentally and verbally abused me by consistently putting me down, minimizing my feelings and aspirations, and calling me names. This same man attempted to crush my head with his hands, and choke me on two separate occasions in his sleep. I say this happened in his sleep because that’s what he claimed- he had no recollection of it, and because the incidents happened after me asking him to push over in the middle of the night, he must have become overwhelmed with anger in his sleep.

I’ve had years of counselling and stages of grief and admittance I’ve gone through to be able to feel comfortable enough to share this information with my current partner, let alone an online community. I’m here because now I’m experiencing this feeling of need for justice or for him to know what he put me through. At the same time, I don’t know what I can do that wouldn’t make any large waves or publicize much about my situation. I feel like he deserves to live on despite this experience just as much as I do, even though he did what he did.

I guess I have a few questions for you:
1. What do you think about this “in my sleep” excuse? I still doubt it sometimes because no one can deny that what he did was cruel, but is it really his fault if he was asleep? How could you not remember that?

2. What would you do in my situation? Would you take legal action, contact him or his family, or just move on?

3. What even are my options, if any? Do I have a choice of anything I can do to help myself feel as if someone has answered for my trauma? Or am I looking at this wrong and should instead redirect my focus on myself once again? I feel like it always comes back to me and changing my mindset. I’m tired of changing.",mysadkid,2019-03-17 20:06:27,1,362,15.16,29.97,75.49,5.31,17.24,16.02,93.65,64.92,25.41,17.4,11.05,0,1.38,4.97,0,8.01,2.76,14.36,11.88,5.25,8.29,1.66,18.23,4.14,2.49,3.04,2.21,1.38,3.59,0.83,2.76,0.55,0.83,0.83,11.05,0.28,0.83,0,5.52,16.57,4.42,2.49,3.04,4.97,0.83,4.97,3.04,0.28,0.28,1.93,2.76,1.93,0.83,0,0,4.42,1.66,0.28,1.66,0.28,0.83,4.42,13.54,0,12.71,2.76,5.25,4.97,0.83,0.28,0.28,0,0,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,13.81,3.31,3.59,0.55,0,2.49,0,0.28,0.55,2.49,0.55,0

b2jsh8,My boyfriend’s parents,"My boyfriend is 17 years old and will be 18 in 9 months. He has been practically living with me for the last 5 months we’ve been dating because of his home situation: his parents don’t feed him, his mother emotionally abuses him, and makes him feel worthless. His stepdad does nothing. His mother doesn’t even make the effort to get him to school - he’d half to walk 5.5 miles every morning to get there. My family gets him up in the morning and takes him. His mom won’t even clear his absences, which has resulted in him getting 14 demerits, which he has worked so hard to clear off since he’s met me. He went from failing 3 classes to passing all of them last semester. His mom shows love only to his siblings and expects my boyfriend to clean the entire apartment and do her bidding. She has told him to his face that he is not allowed to get a job and is not allowed to get a drivers license. When we met him, he did not even have a mattress - he slept on a wooden board on the floor,, causing major back problems, while he asked his mother time and time again for a mattress. While both his siblings had full beds. The majority of his belongings are at our house, so he has nothing to do at home. His mother can not afford food most of the time. Tonight we were told to take him home by 6 PM, but when we showed up, his mother was not home and his house had no food. We took him to get food because he would have to go to bed hungry, and when we took him home, his mother started an explosive fight saying he’s grounded and not allowed to see me anymore. He wouldn’t even let her get through the front door of his apartment, so he snuck in and packed a suitcase and jumped out the window. She called the police on him and he couldn’t bring himself to describe the abuse, so the officer made him stay with his mother. She has forbid us to see one another anymore and his moving him to a different school starting tomorrow. He has a stress-caused heart condition that has killed his family members in the past and he started getting pain when we were told to leave by the police officer. I have no way of contacting him because his mother took away his cell phone. He’s cut himself in the past and he has a self destructive streak. She has forbid us from ever seeing each other again. I love him so much and I don’t fucking know what to do. He’s my entire life. The next nine months will be unbearable without his comforting, loving words. Without his arms around my body and his hand in mine. I don’t know what to do.

b2mjgu,Is this an abusive friendship?,"TLDR: I was in a manipulative friendship with a girl ('A') and she made me feel like I was not good enough unless I did as she told me. We are not friends anymore. But was it really an abusive friendship? 

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have written in the Survivors' Forum before, but in regards to my Dad. However, I now believe I am in an abuse friendship, but I am not sure if this is possible? Can friends be 'abusive' like parents or partners can?

&amp;#x200B;

Once I have begun to understand my situation I would like to write an anonymous article about my experiences in my student newspaper. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been friends with a girl (let's call her A) for about a year.

&amp;#x200B;

We met in a play at university that we were cast in together and became incredibly close very quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

After rehearsals, we would get drinks and talk about the most intimate details of our lives. She would speak about her family's financial issues and I would open about my abusive relationship with my Dad. It worked both ways. I would comfort her, she would comfort me. And during these dinner dates, we would feel a sense of catharsis. 

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the summer we spoke a lot on social media, as we didn't live in the same part of the country. When we got back to university we spent almost every day together. She would usually ask to come to my house for dinner. We would make a tasty meal and drink expensive wine. 

&amp;#x200B;

'A' told me about how she would fly first class, her parents only drank fancy wine, and they owned a Tesla. I would tell her about my family's rich past. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, when we were around other people, she would start making fun of the things I had told her in confidence. She would mock the fact that I had gone to private school. She would laugh and so would everyone. I brought this up with her but she made me feel bad, saying I had made fun of myself in the past about this and she was just laughing with me, after all, 'I knew it was a joke'. 

&amp;#x200B;

She had started dating a guy almost at the same time we had become friends. However, this guy had been my best friend up until that point and then stopped speaking to me when they got together. At first, I thought this was just a coincidence. We had grown apart, that was it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I asked her if she could speak to him about it, because he wouldn't speak to me, she would get annoyed, saying that it was none of her business because he and I were friends before she got together with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I, therefore, lost all the friends I had when I was friends with him because he lived with them. I was cut off. She spent lots of time with that group. She slipped in, I slipped out. She was my only communication with my old friends. But I tried not to make it weird. I tried not to speak about them. But we would get drunk and she would bost about the great times they had had the other day together, or show me pictures of them on her Instagram. I never appeared on her Instagram, and yet I was with her every, single, day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I asked to take an Instagram story of us together she would tell me 'I look really bad today, please don't get me in the picture'. And yet, the next day, when she was with her other friends (my old friends) she would post pictures of them all together having fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I went to pick her up at her house, she wouldn't invite me in. She would run out and we would leave. The one day we did decide to study at her house, I asked her if I could make a cup of tea in her kitchen and she told me not to because her flatmates were in the kitchen. So, she made the tea for me. I thought this was odd - was she embarrassed for her flatmates to meet me? So, later I went into the kitchen to test this idea. I got myself a glass of water and she followed after me. Her flatmate was in there and I started a friendly conversation. All went fine. But the whole time, 'A' was standing at the other side of the room giving me weird looks, and occasionally would chip in snide remarks about me to put me down in front of her flatmate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once we had an argument outside a pub because she had told me I needed to learn to 'adjust'. She said her dad had taught her this and she had always thought it very important. I didn't understand what she meant. She went on to explain that I should adjust who I was according to the situation I was in. I told her of course I did that! Yes, I am bubbly and outgoing, but when I am with my boyfriend's grandparents, for example, of course, I quieten down a little. But she meant more than that. She meant I should CHANGE who I fundamentally was depending on the circumstance. I thought this an awful way to live, and so we had to agree to disagree. 

&amp;#x200B;

Effectively, throughout the friendship, she would tell me what I should and should not wear, what wine to drink, how to do my make-up, who to be friends with, and if I was to meet her parents, I would have to 'adjust' myself, otherwise they would not take to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was honestly sick of her not accepting the person I was. I kept thinking she was doing it to help me, but it really just made me feel like she didn't like me for who I was. I was her doll. She wanted to make me into someone she wanted me to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last straw happened one evening when I had ASKED HER if I could meet her boyfriend to resolve our issues. I had wanted to do this so that we could all hang out and be friends. I hoped this would reduce the strain on my friendship with 'A'. 

&amp;#x200B;

I met up with her boyfriend ('B') and we had a great time. It was like nothing bad had happened between us. We could be friends again! 

&amp;#x200B;

I was set to meet 'A' after drinks with 'B'. We were going to go to a play, then dinner, then the pub, before I would leave her to go clubbing with some friends. I had invited her clubbing but she had said she would be too tired and wanted to go home. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks earlier 'A' had introduced me to her friend 'C'. They did the same course at university and I 'C' wanted to interview me for a film she was making. I then met 'C' a few more times to make some more films. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to hang out with 'A' and 'C' at the pub. I introduced 'C' and she was excited. We were going to go clubbing after meeting 'A' at the pub. 

&amp;#x200B;

I texted 'A' to tell her about the plans I had made with 'C' and I recieved a flurry of confused messages back. At first she asked 'Why?' and then described it as a 'random' idea. She then told me she wasn't going to come. She told me she was upset and didn't want to speak about it over text. So, I called her. She also said she didn't want to explain herself over the phone. So, I invited her to come to my house. 

&amp;#x200B;

She came over. She strutted through the front door and into my room where I was getting ready to go out. She started to explain herself and then stopped to ask my why I was still putting my makeup on. - At this point I recognise that I could have handled this part of the situation better. I could have given her the attention she wanted straight away. But, I had just got off the phone with her having shouted at me for 5 minutes without explaining what I had done wrong. I was feeling defensive, particularly because she was in my bedroom and behaving aggressively. - She then proceeded to shout that I wasn't listening and didn't care about her. She claimed it to be awful that I had asked one of her FRIENDS to come to the pub with us. She also mentioned the fact I had met her boyfriend to be difficult for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was beginning to sense that she was possibly jealous I had become friends with her boyfriend again and was gaining a friendship with one of her friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

She stormed outside and demanded me to unlock the door for her. I said I would but tried to calm her down and asked her if she was sure she wanted to leave and not sort things out. She called me 'patronising' for asking her this. So, I unlocked the door. - Again, I regret saying this but by this point I was absolutely shocked by her behaviour, especially as she had been shouting at me in my own home. - I told her there was 'something wrong with her head' and she screamed at me to 'f\*\*\* off'.

&amp;#x200B;

We didn't speak after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, then I realised I needed closure. So, I asked her to meet me at a pub to speak things through.

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't understand that shouting at a friend like that was wrong. She thought I should have been understanding that she was 'upset', even if it did seem uncalled for and aggressive.

&amp;#x200B;

She asked me if I wanted to add anything and I, regrettably, admitted that I felt she had bullied me in the past and been a bit of a manipulative friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is now the reason why I am writing here today. She told me I had always been the manipulative one. She told me I would make myself out as the victim with all my friendships and then be a 'b\*\*\*\*' and a 's\*\*\* friend'. She said I had a victim's complex and that the friends I had lost from her boyfriend's friendship group didn't like me but didn't want to say it to my face, so they just ghosted me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I don't know what to believe. Was she the manipulator or was I? Who was the victim? Did she abuse me or me her? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand and just want to sort this out in my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

b2ot10,Should I try to remember or just let the memory fade and die?,"&amp;#x200B;

I have recently been remembering things from my childhood that are really shaking me up. When I was 4 my mom remarried, my stepdad basically became my dad since my father was completely out of the picture. That first year of having him as my dad was perfect. We had nice cars, a vacation home, gadgets, game systems, etc. The icing on the cake was we still had amazing times together as a family, there was never a dull moment and everyone in the family seemed happy.

Everything started to go south sometime after my 5th birthday. He would come home late, skip dinner, things in the house started to go missing, he would take me strange places, and he started to get aggressive with the family. It eventually escalated to straight up abuse. He would verbally abuse my sister about her body and beat on my mom and brother. I kind of got off easy, the worst he did was force feed me and yell at me if I didn't finish my food. Eventually, I became a chubby kid which eventually led to him shaming me for being chubby, luckily I didn't have to deal with that for long. My mom had enough after about 1 year, the beatings were getting worse and he was starting to target us, the kids, more often.

Before my mom left she tried to get all of us kids out of the house because she was scared of a fight breaking out. I don't know how it all happened but I was the last kid left in the house to send off somewhere.   I'm fuzzy on the details from that night, but somehow my stepdad figured out that my mom was going to leave him. He went ballistic, out of nowhere things were getting physical. I remember him just punching my mom in the face and she tried to fight back but it was no good. She was trying so hard to scream and get him to stop. I even tried to get him to stop, I was begging but he just wouldn't listen. He just turn around and yelled at me to get out of the room, my mom started crying and begged me to leave. She promised that it would all be okay. I just remember being frozen in fear, it took so much effort to just crawl into the nearest room. I was so scared I hid in the closet, I didn't know what else to do, I wanted to help my mom so badly but I couldn't. I was too scared to try to get the phone and too scared to try and run away. I sat there listing to the fight, it was horrific. 

The last thing I distinctly remember from that night is hearing my mom asking him not to hurt me. After that I thibnk he threw her into the wall and she just let out the worst scream ever. I don't want to describe it, the thought of it make me sick to my stomach. After that everything goes blank. The next memory I have is being in the back of my grandpa's car on the way to the hospital. Every time I try and remember what happened after he threw my mom something keeps stopping me. I get a bad headache, shut down, shake, cry uncontrollably, or blank out for a few seconds. Would remembering the whole night help my healing process or should I just let the memory fade and die.

b2reu8,Could they be abused?,"Hey, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I'm not sure who to ask. 
I live in a pretty normal suburban neighborhood. There's these young kids who live down the block who seem to live with whom I presume is their grandparents. Tbh they seem a little odd: the kids ages 1-9 often run around in their underwear, sometimes the small kids will run out into the street even though it's a relatively busy sidestreet, and once I saw the 4 year old pee on another neighbors car... but I know absolutely nothing about kids or parenting so who am I to judge? Long story short, one day I was out and about in the neighborhood two of the kids are riding their bikes and they began to talk to me. They started rambling on about anything and everything. I was only half paying attention being like ""mmhmm"" and ""oh that's interesting."" However, later that day I suddenly remembered something that one of the kids said when I was half listening. It was something along the lines of, ""one time *so and so* (the way she said it it sounded like a parental figure) threw me into the bed and it really, really hurt."" And I was like, wait, is she being abused? Maybe I misunderstood the story or maybe this was when she was living with someone else and because of this the kids are now living with their grandparents? Several months have passed since then but I think about it a lot. I don't want to be an adult who turns a blind eye to abuse, but I dont want to be a neighbor to call social services on someone who doesn't deserve it.                                                    


tl;dr: a few months ago a young neighborhood kid may have offhandedly mentioned to me that a parental figure hurt them.

b2suo6,My mother is a manipulative abuser,"Hello all, I need your help with my situation. I have a verbally abusive and sometimes physically abusive mother. I am 19 years old and I live at my college campus. I was adopted when I was 7 and my brother, 5 was with me. My mother, father, and adoptive brother took me in. My parents divorced and its been torture since. My 5 year old brother was eventually diagnosed with adhd and i was diagnosed with depression in my late teens. My mother had influenced our mental illnesses but refuses to see things from my side. She believes that I make it a mission to ruin her days. I earned my associates degree at 18 and hot accepted into nursing school a few weeks ago. But my mother discounts my work and says it is all because of her. She put a roof over my head and gave me everything I needed. Just yesterday, she went after me at my grandparents house. She said that I was ungrateful because i told her i didnt owe her anything which she took as i didnt need to respect her. She referes to me as the girl who has ruined her mother's life and caused irrepairable damage. My 99 year old grandfather was screamed at for standing up for her ""disobedient and ungrateful child"" I've had enough of this abuse. Her blood son supports her and says just as awful things about me. She favorites him and lashes out at me. I don't know what to do, but she has too much power and finances my school. As long as she supports me, she has access to hurt me.

b2v9ls,Now it’s an uphill battle,"After filing a restraining order against my husband last week, now dcp&amp;p has opened a case. I just found out he has representation, after telling me several times (since we started discussing divorce) that we could not afford it. Our hearing is tomorrow, but I’m going to adjourn for two reasons, one, I only JUST found out he has representation, and two, I need time to retain my own (found a pro-bono lawyer), and I’m desperately trying to find therapists records to indicate that has been a long history of severe psychological and emotional abuse. About dcp&amp;p, they had asked, after I did the under oath thing, whether the children were ever abused, and of course, I wasn’t going to lie. The physical abuse a couple times, but the psychological abuse is more painful and paralyzing, it’s ongoing and has the most long lasting effects on its victims. My daughter has experienced this, and she is terrified of her father, her anxiety has manifested itself in physical ways, stomach pains, lack of appetite, nausea and vomiting, headaches. He is out of the house for now, but I’m terrified. See, he is in complete financial control. Over the years of being a stay at home mom EVERYTHING is now in his name, I have nothing. Even this house that we’re in is ONLY in his name. I do not want him to stay away forever, in a lot of ways he is a great father, great husband, but in more ways he is neither. Once I realized what was happening, and that it was abuse, I began trying to fight back, just over a year ago. Now here we are, he is out of the house, I’m afraid I won’t be able to get a permanent restraining order indicating he needs professional help with his mental abuse of us, he needs to learn how NOT to do it. I’m not going to give up. Not talking about the abuse she has suffered has made our daughter sick, and the longer it gets put on the back burner, the worse she’ll get. I need to keep him away for a while. So she and I can start to heal and begin to see a future for ourselves where we aren’t afraid anymore, where we aren’t constantly second guessing our feelings. We are not to blame for this, and I’m desperately trying to keep from convincing myself that we won’t get away. Our younger has been spared, she’s daddy’s favorite, he wouldn’t dare lay a finger on her or hurt her emotionally, but I can’t take the chance that that will happen. I’m so terrified for me and my daughter. Please pray for us, send good vibes, whatever you need to do. We need to be safe.

b2vavq,Does this sound like sexual abuse?,"Hi. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but here goes nothing.

I've been abused by a lot of people, but mainly by my own family members. I repress a lot of things. I've always had this feeling that something was wrong (like something wrong happened) but I can't remember what. I used to get random flashes of memories, but I could barely hold on to any of them. 

My parents had me around people who I recently found out were pedophiles (lunch man from elementary school, neighbors). I have a creepy pedophile uncle and my older brother is oddly sexual around me. My uncle would talk about his young 16 year old daughters' friends boobs at the dinner table, in front of all of my family and his family. My parents wouldn't let me wear anything mildly revealing at all if he was going to be anywhere near. In middle school my older brother was ""babysitting"" me and my younger brother, and he came out of his room with a boner in basketball shorts telling me to go to my room (I was in the living room) and he kept laughing at me. I was so shocked and disgusted I just froze and said nothing and left. In high school he asked me if I ever gave a blowjob to anyone or my bf and I was like ""wtf no you creep."" He then told me about how he got a blowjob when he was like 16 on the school bus. He would tell me about having sex with girls and how nice his new gfs ass is. He told me about how he lost his virginity, I didn't want to hear about any of that shit. He brought porn into the car with me and my mom and just laughed. He comes by my place sometimes to borrow my lawn mower and he always says shit about hearing me and my bf fucking when we definitely weren't?? I was obviously uncomfortable and made it clear every time he said something inappropriate.

With my bf, I think I recovered some kind of memory. This makes me sick to type out. I gave him a blowjob and the taste for some reason made me think back to when I was in kindergarten or younger. I tasted something that tasted exactly like that, but I don't know what it was. The memory was a quick blurry flash. I also remember being in kindergarten on the school bus and thinking about killing myself. Why the fuck was a 6 year old thinking about ending her life? I can't fucking remember. I also knew what sex was somehow in kindergarten and I don't remember at all how I learned about it.",kittybeans98,2019-03-19 02:32:47,3,468,26.09,28.91,83.83,3.43,16.14,13.89,95.51,58.76,22.22,17.31,12.18,0.21,0.21,4.49,0.21,4.91,3.85,13.68,7.91,6.62,8.33,2.35,17.74,3.63,2.35,2.56,0.64,2.14,4.49,1.07,3.42,0.43,1.71,0.21,13.46,2.56,1.28,1.07,6.2,17.31,3.85,2.14,1.71,5.34,2.99,3.21,3.21,0.43,1.71,0.43,5.56,1.28,0.64,2.99,1.07,5.34,3.63,0.43,0.43,0.43,0.43,9.62,5.98,0.43,13.89,1.5,7.48,4.91,2.35,1.07,1.5,0.21,0,0.21,2.56,1.71,1.07,0,0,0,12.82,5.56,1.92,0,0,0.85,0,0,0.85,2.35,1.28,0

b2x6ba,First relationship after abusive ex?,"I’m a 19 year old in college who is somewhat fresh out of officially blocking my sociopathic ex boyfriend from everything. He mentally abused me for 3 years and made it really hard to leave. It got to the point where I’m looking back at details and remembering some physical abuse too. I’m definitely still in the process of dealing with what he put me through. 
Recently, my best friend (the only other person who knows about this) introduced me to this guy who I have been going on dates with for about a month. Not a lot has happened sexually, we kissed once but I haven’t made an effort to kiss him again since. He is the complete opposite of my ex, the sweetest guy I’ve ever met. I could never imagine him raising my voice at me or pushing me. 
He asked me to be his girlfriend last night and I completely shutdown at the question. I knew this would be coming soon. Luckily, he caught on and asked if I had a bad relationship, and I nodded. For thirty minutes I couldn’t even speak at all until he started making jokes to diffuse the subject, and everything went back to normal. I never gave him a response. I feel horrible because I can’t imagine how he feels in this situation. I want to try to tell him more about my ex, but I also feel it isn’t right to burden a guy with details when you aren’t even officially dating.

b2z20y,What to do when you know an abusive ex is/has been in possession of child pornography? (UK),"I hope this is allowed here, I'm sorry if not. Posted in /Advice but posting here just in case. This has been eating me up for years now.

When I was a teenager (about 8/9 years ago now) I went out with a guy for two years. I knew he was into weird shit on the internet, regular 4chan browser, had a pretty twisted sense of humour. I had no friends at the time and my depression was at rock bottom, I was self-harming and pretty much suicidal - I guess I was in a vulnerable, easily manipulated and very confused place and sort of latched onto him as he showed me attention.

While we were together he was extremely jealous, manipulative, mentally and physically abusive. He would hold me up against walls by my neck and yell in my face. He would force me into sexual acts that I made clear I didn't want. I was made to feel incredibly small and very much controlled by him, my self-esteem practically non-existent at this point. He definitely had a superiority complex and would always tell me how stupid and naive I was and I suppose I fell into this mindset of 'he knows better than me' and 'he's more intelligent than me, I should listen to him' sort of thing.

He started to show me the type of porn he looked at on the internet, but it was never anything 'normal'. It would always be on 4chan/b/ or a different browser (I think it was Onion/Tor?). It would be really hardcore stuff, women getting hurt, treated like sub-humans, that kind of thing. Which was obviously really shocking to see. One day he told me he had photos of child pornography, and showed them to me. I don't know why he showed them to me. I remember being shocked but for some reason didn't react in the way I would now, or any sane person would for that matter. I remember thinking as long as he's not out there actively abusing children, if this stops him, then that's surely better. And I let him carry on. And I don't know why. He even received a letter from the police to his house once that he showed me, saying that child pornography was suspected at his IP address or something. I don't know what became of that. I assume he deleted everything but I honestly can't remember.

I have to stress the fact that mentally I was in an extremely weak and confused place and I know if this happened now I would have reported him to the police in a heartbeat. The guilt is overwhelming.

Years later I am only just processing what I went through in that relationship, the abuse, the photos, and so on. I have never spoken to anybody about this and I don't know why it's taken me so long to realise and I feel horrible about it. He has moved to the city I now live in and have seem him around a few times. I feel sick when I see him, and have had panic attacks several times. I saw on Facebook the other day that his sister has two little girls now. I felt sick to my stomach at the thought of what he did all those years ago and what he may still be doing. I don't know if he is still looking at those photos, maybe he has stopped but maybe not. There is no way for me to know. I am scared for his future relationships and for his family.

I need to report this and I need advice on how to do this. I am UK based.

b319q6,How to leave my abuser who I had a baby with,"Obvious throwaway account. 

I'm in an emotionally abusive relationship. I've been with my SO for almost 3 years and everything was great until we had our daughter 5 months ago. Since then he has become extremely sexist and does things just to get me to argue or get me upset then he gets angry with me when I stop talking or don't want to be part of the conversation. He constantly flips his opinion on important subjects and says terrible things to our daughter. 

For example, our daughter is getting to eating mushy food and she has been doing really well at daycare and with me but my SO ties her arms into her onesie and forces her to cry so he can shove food in her mouth making her choke. Anytime I go near him to convince him there is a better way he makes her cry more on purpose and says she will eat or die. I honestly don't feel comfortable with him being alone with her but I don't want him to not see his daughter. I just feel like he will take his hatred for me out on her and it breaks my heart that she is in the middle of all this. 

Any advice is welcome in this situation.

b334n3,Possible sexual trauma,"Hi,

I have been going through childhood memories as part of my addiction recovery. Plenty of stuff that now makes sense and explains a lot of my behaviour and emotional  problems. Biggest problem seems to be my fear of abandonment. But as I have been learning about my self the past year I have had to accept and realize faults or even mental problems that have been affecting my life profoundly without me havingthe slightest clue about them until now. One of the problems i have found out is my problem with women. I have always had women flirting and showing interest but to me no sign is enough to make a move, that is when i am sober. Sure i hve had relationships even long ones and casual sex but my problem is that i feel somehow intimitaded by women i am interested in.  For example I get matches in tinder but after couple of messages I just stop trying even when things look promising.  Also I typically friendzone all the girls I get to know, propably because i dont feel intimitaded by female friends. In my relationships I have been somewhat ashamed of my sexuality. But now to the abuse:

Dont remember how old i was when my 2 years older sister and her friend asked me to my sisters room to play. They wanted me to climb over my sis and pretend to have sex with her with both of us having only underwear on, which I did. I cant remember what if anything happened after that. I do remember not having a clue what we were doing and them somehow explaining like it is natural thing to do. Now as I try to remember all that comes to mind is that I felt really bad and that I felt it was wrong and I kept thinking and having dreams about it, both were extremly shameful and unpleasent
. I still feel ashamed and i would not want to remember it at all. Im quite close to my sister now but there has always been something i cant stand about her . Her touch has always been very unpleasent to me. But the weird thing is I have always wondered about my little fetish about white panties, untill I rememberd what happened, she was wearing white panties when we were ""doing it"". Also when i was a teenager i used to watch her body and sometimes even jerk off thinking about her body. Now it makes me sick to even think about that. I emphasize body because, really,it was just her ass i was thinking about. 

My question is could something like that actually cause me some sexual trauma?",Awaythrowajust,2019-03-19 14:26:06,1,454,12.58,17.74,89.16,1.49,18.92,17.62,94.27,61.45,21.37,15.2,12.11,0.66,0,1.76,0.66,6.17,1.98,13,11.67,9.03,8.15,1.76,21.37,3.74,1.98,2.2,0.44,2.42,6.39,1.54,4.63,0.88,0.44,0.22,7.93,0.88,0.44,3.74,0,19.16,6.39,1.98,2.42,4.19,1.76,3.74,2.64,1.1,0,1.32,3.08,1.1,0.66,1.32,0,7.71,2.86,0.88,1.32,0.44,2.2,7.71,11.89,0.44,10.35,1.1,3.3,5.95,0.22,0.66,0.22,0,0,0,0.44,0.22,0,0,0,0,7.71,4.85,1.98,0.22,0,0.22,0,0,0.44,0,0,0
b33jag,How can I help an abused family member?,"Hello all. I'm new to this subreddit. I am at a loss right now and dont know what to do....For context:

I live with my mom dad brother and grandparents. My grandmother phsycologically abuses everyone in the household. She controls everything. She insults us if we dont agree with her and she lies constantly. However...the brunt of this falls on my grandfather.

She abuses him phsycologically, CONSTANTLY. She calls him names and belittles him nonstop, controls what he eats, where he sits and what he watches. When we try to intervene she flips the situation and acts like hes the one being ridiculous and that we should help *her*. Not only that, but she will take her lies and manipulation to the grave. She will never stop arguing or lying if you fight back. Never.

Its recently come to light (only known to a few of us) that she may have sexually abused him in the past year or two as well. I've always hated my grandmother. But this is the final straw. This cant keep happening. 

The problem? My grandfather refuses any help. He tells us what she does to him(and often we can hear the yelling), but whenever somebody offers to help him get away he will refuse. Hes even stated he fears she may kill him, but he wont leave. 

Everyone says the cops cant be called and nothing can be done unless he personally speaks out. And I know he never will. Is there really nothing me and my family can do to help?",Proncus,2019-03-19 14:59:36,14,269,5.09,95.26,2.24,1,10.76,14.5,94.8,64.68,25.65,19.7,4.83,2.6,0.37,11.9,0,5.95,4.83,8.55,10.78,7.06,9.67,4.09,17.1,1.86,1.12,2.97,0.74,1.12,7.43,0.74,6.69,0.37,5.2,0.74,27.88,3.72,0,6.32,8.55,14.5,1.12,1.49,1.49,3.72,3.72,5.2,2.23,0.74,1.49,0,1.12,0,0.37,0.37,0.37,10.78,6.32,0.74,4.09,0.74,1.12,1.86,14.13,2.6,11.15,1.12,3.72,6.69,0,0.74,1.12,0,0,0.74,0.74,0,0,0.37,0.37,0,17.47,10.78,2.23,0.37,0,1.12,0,0,0,0.74,1.49,0.74

b3j8y8,"Please read,","This is probably going to sound ridiculous because there are people who are experiencing worse things and don't whine about it but anyways,

I turned 16 recently. I'm Thai but moved to France after my mother divorced my father when I was ( around ) 6 years old ( it's a complicated story, my mother used to live in France, met my father there but he got "" banned "" due to shit he did ect.. anyways )

I used to live at my aunt's place with my mother, and the weekends she would send me to my grandmother's place where my aunt and uncle lived.

I was a calm child, until I reached ~10 years old. Can't exactly remember how I was actually, but I remember my mother beating the shit out of me so I'm assuming I was often annoying. My uncle beat me up too, mostly with a "" reason "" but I almost always thought he was wrong.

Example : I remember him shoving my head into the wall when I was in elementary school just because I pushed my grandmother a bit to go to the toilets.
I remember him almost strangling me and making my nose bleed because I talked back : I had a plush in my arms, he said I was too old for that and I said "" so what? ""
I admit talking back was wrong on my part, but I ended up with his hands leaving a mark on my hand and had to wear scarves for a whole month.

My mother was less violent, well she's less strong, but it still hurt a lot. She also made my nose bleed but can't remember why. 
Sometimes she was right and sometimes she wasn't but didn't admit it. My grandmother used to beat her kids but nowadays she's chill and never touched me, as for my aunt, she just yells ( and barely yelled at me anyways )

Remember the aunt I used to live with? She was probably the closest thing I had to a mother. I didn't dislike my own mother.. but I wasn't exactly close to her. We didn't hug, we didn't go out together.. I only did that with my two aunts and my grandmother. Sometimes my uncle too.

What bothered me a lot about this is that, even though my uncle beat the shit out of me, sometimes for reasons I couldn't understand, I couldn't hate him.. I felt uncomfortable alone with him, it was awkward on my part, but he acted normally.
I couldn't see him as a bad person, because, besides the violence, he was a nice uncle. He bought me whatever I wanted for my birthday, I went to Disneyland with him..

My aunt ( the one I lived with ) died when I was ~12ish. It's like my actual mother died. I cried literally every day, I wasn't okay at all.
I never had a father figure and I lost my "" mother "", I felt really lonely.
My mother and I started living at my aunt's place without her. It's very small - a small living room where we sleep, a tiny kitchen and bathroom.

I started going to middle school, had problems even there, some other kids bullied me but whatever that's another story, all I can say is that I was a crybaby. Seriously I cried for literally anything.
Things weren't great at home either. I remember my mother strangling me too, once also threw objects at me and I went to school with purple arms. NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG I wasnt a stress reliever ( at least, most of the time ) but there was no reason to go this far.

I talked to three friends and they didn't take me seriously at all. One of them did research about it and then completely forgot. I didn't want to be annoying so I just let it go.

Then things changed again after high school and I started standing up for myself. I got into some fights at school, I finally started speaking up. This also applied to my mother.

Whenever she yelled at me I would yell back, and I hated giving up so fights would last hours. I never beat her up, but sometimes even held her wrists so she wouldn't do it. 

She has been stressed for 2 or 3 years. We're always tight on money and her job isn't exactly the best ( either she's working 7/7 either she's doing nothing bc there is no work ) and I can understand being frustrated.
I admit going overboard sometimes too. I can be mean and I'm aware of that, but I say it when I'm wrong and she just can't admit it.

Then again maybe I'm wrong for trying to treat her as an equal.. maybe I really should suck it up, but the moment I hear something I disagree with, I say it and we start arguing again.
We're also lowkey in trouble because the walls are thin and my neighbors complained because of the noise &gt;.&gt; 

Thing is : we can get along 2 or 3 days but there's always that one thing and we end up arguing, she almost beats me up, threatens me, I cry, we end up staying in our bed ( we both sleep on the couch ) and just don't talk at all. It's so AWKWARD you guys have no idea.

We sometimes fight for the dumbest reasons!!! Like recently ; she saw me on the verge of sleeping at 6pm and told me to not sleep. I asked her to wake me up after 30 min but I ended up waking up at 11pm with the lights on. The fight started because of THIS.
And in the end? She told me to shut up before she slit my throat and sent me to the hospital ( I'm literally quoting her )

Honestly I can be wrong a lot of times.. I whine a lot, I can be very annoying, I'm aware of that. It's also wrong on my part. But we just can't have a normal conversation. It always ends up in a fight.

I don't even hate her!!! I just can't. She's not bad most of the time.. she can be unfair but not rude. She doesn't hate me. She did stuff for me. Heck she even payed for my braces ( might sound dumb but that's a lot of money. I'm still surprised she did it. )
Sometimes I even feel really bad for her. She had an abusive husband, divorced and went back to France and now she has a whiny kid who keeps arguing with her.

I just don't know how to feel anymore. Maybe all of this is normal and just a part of being a teenager and shit and maybe this happens in every families idk
I have no idea
I'm just confused

b3sax8,I (34M) broke up with my wife (34F) this last week over cheating. I'm concerned that she has been manipulated into this situation by an abuser.,"Crossposted to /r/breakups and /r/infidelity

I might just need some support or a place to vent, I'm not sure.

My wife (I'll call her K) and I met around 23, been dating since 25, and got married at 27. She's an incredibly kind, moral, and giving person. She comes from a broken family - her dad passed away 3 years ago, her mentally ill mom ended up getting homeless (after moving in with us, trying to destroy our life, and I had to evict her, now she lives in her van), she doesn't really have any extended family (especially because her narcissist hoarder mom pushed them all away) and other than me my wife doesn't have very many friends, except for one friend which I will call J. I on the other hand have a healthy network of about 10 or so close friends and I still talk to my immediate family. Despite all this she is sweet as cupcakes, creative beyond belief, she works at an old folks home as a baker and uses all her energy to try to improve the lives of the older residents in whatever way she can, they are her missing grandparents to her. We have built a life together and through eachother have found stability and peace in the world.

I have a close female friend who I have respected boundaries of throughout our entire friendship, and I believe in the good of people until I am shown otherwise, so when my wife told me she had a close lifelong male friend (J) I made a promise that I would not restrict who she had as friends or what she did with her life. K occasionally hung out with J throughout our marriage and it never was a big deal.

K's dad passed away and her mom became homeless both within the first 3 years of our marriage and it hit her hard. She withdrew from a lot of her interests and stopped making friends, and she hit some pretty heavy depression. Regretibly we never seeked therapy, it was too expensive and we leaned on eachother. Being raised by a great father / husband I figured this is what life is and I should support K through her hard times, which I did. I kept going to work every day and making the money and helped pay the bills and sustained a hard marriage that was filled with unreasonable expectations out of her mother and withdrawn affection from K. Our bedroom life has been kind of dead for years, sex happens fairly infrequently and it usually is only because I initiate.

2 years ago K had a birthday party where she invited all of her friends together to get fucked up and party. J was there and pretty much creeped everyone out at the party. When the party was over he spent an hour drilling me on accusing me of sabotaging 'his' party (their birthdays are right up near eachother) and K refused to take a side on the matter. I got pissed and told her that he had to go. She went passive and these sort of accusations from him against me kept flying for a few months.

Just before the party K and I got a tattoo on our delayed honeymoon and it was a major life decision for me, I am personally pretty against tattoos and it was a major commitment for me to get a matching tattoo with her. Well, prior to the events of the birthday party I already encouraged K to go with her friends (including J) to a festival in June. Since the plans were made I just let it play out while maintaining heavy suspicion of J's motives. I still believe in freedom and autonomy in my marriage as long as boundaries are maintained, and I trust K while I didn't trust J. K and J both got matching tattoos during this trip, and I was devistated, this was like a wedding ring for me and its like she has a wedding ring on with another guy as well. K defends it and says that she is getting some kind of symbolic matching tattoos with all of her close friends (she was) and I didn't really have any choice but to accept it. But it did destroy the symbolism of my own tattoo. I then go online and uncover his secret online persona where he sees her as a sex object and assumes because I have female friends I must be trying to cheat on karla (he doesn't know that we have had an open marriage and swinger friends at this point for awhile) and all of my intentions are impure.

I showed her the evidence and asked her to cut him off totally and she did, for like 6 months. Eventually the drama died down and she and she eventually told me that they got back in contact and she swore up and down that he was harmless and she needed a friend, and he was that friend. That he had changed and that he has grown from his malice into a better person. I didn't buy it but I did trust her judgment implicitly. I told him I'd never hang out with him but as long as she is maintaining boundaries she is free to have whichever friends she pleases.

This goes on without incident for another year or so until this past saturday and I look at her phone by random chance. It's unlocked, and usually it is locked, enforcing the boundary of privacy between us (this is the way I wanted our marriage). It was filled with vile descriptions of cheating for the last two months. Timestamps line up with us doing events such as valentines day. it's like the last 2 months were a lie.

So I break up almost immediately. I start making plans to move out and move on because after all the boundaries that have been crossed, this is the worst. We literally had an open marriage where the only person banned from our sex life was him due to the way he has been disparaging me in the past. Every experience I have had with this guy has been negative despite my every effort to extend olive branches. I read him as an abusive sociopath and I told her that he was trying to replace me. And he did.

Here is the problem now. I know I have to move on. But douchebag J here has basically pushed my wife into a corner by my interpretation pushing her boundaries a little further every time. They take some drugs, her boundaries are weak, something happens, then he makes her affirm the new boundaries (text messages to the effect of I'd still do this with you sober). Then a little shit talking about me here and a little bit of affection there and he takes advantage of my wifes depression and destroys what used to be my sweet caring loving wife by turning her into a sex object and a manipulative liar just like her. Just kind of like I said was going to happen 2 years ago.

So I'm leaving I guess. I tried and I failed. But I still care about her - she's depressed and highly susceptible to manipulation. She has ignored our mutual friends and at this point she pretty much only has abuser as a friend and no extended family to fall back on. I don't think she has the strength to live independently. She also relies on me financially for her quality of life.

Did I fuck up by not maintaing my boundaries 2 years ago? Do I just let this go without any intervention? Is there any way to save her from J's manipulation into falling into an abusive relationship with him? The guy has the emotional maturity of a rock and I am sure as soon as conflict happens he will lash out at her and she will feel she has no fallback. I'm not entirely sure this is totally my wifes fault. He has made this situation and taken my marriage over and he has won. I don't want to let him win and I care for her future but I'm not sure I have any energy left in me to try, and I need to secure my own sanity and my own life.

Unfortunately on top of this part of me really finds the idea of not having to deal with this drama or her personal issues appealing. It's hard to care when my own emotional needs haven't been met for years now.

Any advice? Please don't just tell me she is an awful person and I need to move on, she is not, she has just has been delt shitty hand and a snake with a silver tounge took advantage of that. I'm not as much worried about me as I am about her. But I can't save her or support her much longer after these events, and I don't know if there is anything I can do to help in light of that. Is there anything I can do to help make the breakup easier or safer?

tl;dr:

Wife of 5 years was depressed due to family loss, and I suspect taken advantage of and coerced by her long time friend into cheating. I'm concerned that by leaving her she will have no choice but to be his victim once she has no other resources. I still love her but am at the end of the limit to how much I can sustain things.",systemadvisory,2019-03-21 09:04:08,19,1631,42.14,66.39,28.87,54.63,21.75,15.27,90.68,58.8,19.44,14.96,6.87,1.04,0.06,6.68,0.31,4.48,5.03,14.53,9.44,4.48,8.09,1.84,16.92,3.49,2.15,0.98,0.98,2.27,6.81,4.05,2.51,0.12,1.1,0.55,15.02,2.21,1.41,5.89,2.27,10.61,1.53,1.72,0.86,2.76,1.72,2.82,1.29,0.25,0.31,0.55,2.08,0.31,1.04,0.43,0.25,10.42,5.09,1.84,2.15,1.41,0.74,6.01,9.69,1.1,13.98,1.78,6.62,5.64,0.55,1.04,0.55,0.49,0.12,0.12,1.29,0.37,0.8,0.67,0.12,0,10.91,4.29,2.33,0.06,0.06,0.31,0,0.12,0,1.96,1.47,0.31

b43vml,Is this abuse?,"So a bit of back story...my (ex) girlfriend and I had only been together for a few months when this happened.  I reek of undiagnosed autism and as such, sometimes I say things that don't come out right. She knew this and we talked about openly occasionally. 

We were laying in bed one night and she was talking about body insecurity - she is a beautiful girl but she still saw issues with her body. And i decided to contribute by giving cr*p to the unrealistic standards that girls are held to. 
So my stupid ass says, ""I can see how you might not see yourself meeting those standards, but those standards are rubbish"" 
At the time, i didn't realize anything wrong. 

For days, everything was fine on my end. But a few days later, she invited me on a bike ride. Side note - i don't enjoy bike riding nor am I good at it, but I go because i get to spend time with her. 
This day, we went a different route than usual and after about 10 minutes she started riding further and further infront of me until i couldn't see her.  I wasn't going to turn back, because that's rude. 
She had a smile.on her face every time in saw her. so I didn't think anything was wrong. 

So i kept riding...picture a sweaty sloth on a bike riding at three miles and hour...for what seemed like hours but was only one hour. She waited for me at the midway point, we watched dogs in the dog park for 30 seconds. Meanwhile, im still dying because there are hills and stuff. 30 seconds is not enough rest. 

She immediately starts riding away from me and disappears. and at this point I get the inkling that I did something wrong. but I had no idea what. 
So I proceeded to die and take so long to get back to our starting point. 

Her: so you realize why I did that to you, right? 
Me: No. I must have done something wrong tho. what did I do?
Her: what you said the other night. i didn't like it. 
Me: oh crap. i didn't even realize. im so sorry, sometimes i don't realize i say things. but I will be more careful about what I say. 
Her: *silence* 

At this point i wanted to cry. because this was two and a half hours or torture that could hsve been solved with a conversation. 
I felt betrayed. 

She broke up with me a few days later. and I ended up consoling her because she felt bad about what she did. 
Important note - she didn't say sorry or actually say anything that showed remorse. she just hated the way she felt.

It still fucks me up to this day.",Commander2098,2019-03-22 04:21:50,1,474,13.01,33.64,89.36,3.54,11.85,13.08,93.46,60.34,23.84,16.24,9.07,1.05,1.05,5.06,0,7.59,4.01,11.18,9.28,6.75,8.86,3.16,21.73,4.85,2.11,1.9,1.69,1.27,5.7,1.69,4.01,0.21,1.48,1.05,11.18,0,0.21,5.49,0,12.03,2.74,1.69,0.84,2.53,0.63,4.64,4.64,2.11,1.69,0.63,1.48,1.27,0,0.21,0,5.27,1.69,0.21,1.05,1.05,1.27,9.49,9.07,0.63,17.93,2.32,7.38,8.86,0.21,0.63,0.21,0.21,0,0.42,1.27,0.63,0.21,0,0.21,0,18.99,9.92,2.74,1.05,0,0.63,0,0.63,0.42,2.53,0.42,0.63
b445v0,"Black mirrors Arkangel episode. (No spoilers, don’t worry.)","This episode gives me so much anxiety because I could totally see my mom doing that to me. Shes always been abusive and controlling. The type of controlling where I wasn’t even allowed to call her mom. When I was really little, I once tried calling her by her name and she ignored me. She would also ignore me if I called her mom instead of mommy. Even though I was to young to remember this, it still fucked me up for such a long time. I don’t think I started calling her mom until my late teens because of it.  
  
Ive also couldn’t even go out to enjoy myself sometimes. Once my friend had a bday party and everyone slept over. I had to leave before anyone else was even awake because my mom was so controlling. I didn’t get to stay for breakfast (they were having a special pancakes and bacon breakfast), didn’t get to say goodbye to anyone, and couldn’t even get help to find where I had to go to get home. A few people also got robbed at that party (me included) and I had to leave so early that some people thought it was me, that I stole shit and then took off early.  
  
Those are just a couple examples of her being controlling.

b459tc,How do you cope with living with verbally abusive parents?,"I don’t make enough to sustain myself to be able to leave since I am a broke college student with loan debt. The car I have isn’t even under my name, it’s under my mom’s name. I guess they did that so I’d never truly get to be independent.

Everyday I wake up it’s torture. I second I walk out of the house, I get attacked verbally by my mother and my father just silently allows her to. I don’t know how to cope with this. I live in a triggering household and I’m very suicidal. There seems to be no hope that I’ll ever get out because I am a full time student that can’t afford to live on campus (I commute an hour &amp; 30 minutes), I work at Kroger part time that only puts about $120 in my pocket every week. I can’t live by myself like that. I’ve tried looking at places and it’s impossible. I don’t have any friends (who I trust with this information about my family) only acquaintances. 

I ran away this past summer and I wasn’t truly relieved because I knew they’d always have a hold on me and make me come home. It worked, because they knew I couldn’t live on my own because I don’t make enough money. 

I’m scared that even if I do make enough, it will take everything out of me to get the courage to walk out of the house and leave them behind. Not even when they aren’t home like when I ran away the first time, but in front of them and tell them I love them despite their abuse, but I have to take care of myself. I thought they’d realize what they’ve been doing when I ran away, but they don’t think they’re being abusive, they think it’s love. I don’t think they’re ever going to change. But for now, I have to take care of myself in this environment until I can sustain myself. 

I am in therapy, which has helped me, but it’s through my college. They only allow 15 sessions for the year and my last session is Tuesday. Then I’m all alone. I don’t have any skills to combat these feelings of suicide and hopelessness. Anyone who has experience in this type of environment understands what I mean.

b4b6og,My(M 23) Girlfriend (f 24) was abused. I don't know how to cope up with this.,"We started dating when we were in college which was in 2016. At first everything was great and then later she would cry randomly and accuse me of things like I am being fake etc. I never understood any of this. This would only get worse every year. She would say stuff like I don't love her. And that she doesn't want me to settle for her. She would pick fights with me randomly  and walk away from me without telling me anything, leaving me worried.  Later in 2018 she told she was subject to sexual abuse from her family since she was in grade one. There was an uncle , a grandfather and one cousins.  I got depressed. I comforted her telling its not her fault. I urged her to get a therapist which she did. But it was the same cycle again. She would say hurtful things. And question me like I am cheating on her. Then one day she told me back in 2018 she cheated on me with another cousin of hers. They went to third base. She apologized and told me she couldn't control this. I didn't know what to do. Since it was during summer vacation from college. we lived away with our respective families. I was constantly in touch with her and most of times she would send me a picture of her and her cousin. He even spoke with me once. Thinking about it made me sick and angry. I told her If this happens again I can't handle it. And we tried to stray away from discussing this. After this I had to leave my home country to pursue masters. Being alone in a place and nobody to talk reminded of everything again. we would fight often over the phone. After a long time I started to get suicidal thoughts.  I thought I would end it all before returning home. But it got better from there after expressing this with her. At Least I thought it did .  This week I came to know that cousin tried to abuse her again but this time she tried persisted and pushed him away as he tried to continue. Being away from her and not being for her makes me angry and sad. I want to cry and shout at the same time. I can't really focus on academics. I can't talk to her. Makes to want to kill these people. I can't really talk to anyone about this. I can't do  anything. I don't know how to cope with all this. I really love her , she does too but she says she wants to leave me because she is not good enough for me. which just hurts me more.",Unwritten-07,2019-03-22 15:08:28,8,471,24.11,58.4,33.66,1,10.24,11.04,95.33,64.54,27.18,19.32,9.34,1.27,0,8.49,0.21,7.86,1.91,16.56,7.86,4.67,5.94,3.61,18.26,4.88,3.61,1.49,2.34,1.7,5.73,1.06,4.67,0.21,2.12,1.49,17.83,1.7,0.21,7.86,1.06,14.01,2.12,2.12,2.97,2.12,1.27,4.03,2.12,0.21,1.27,0.64,1.49,0,0.64,0.21,0.21,8.28,3.4,1.91,1.06,1.7,0.42,6.79,8.92,0.64,14.44,1.7,5.1,7.86,1.06,0.85,0.85,0,0,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.59,9.77,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.34,0.85,0
b4dto2,How I've managed to Cope Living With an Alcoholic [emotionally] Abusive Parent (Until I move out),"Let me start off with saying I've done quite a lot just recently within the past 3 months to improve myself dramatically. 

👉I've worked on myself to improve on my body weight &amp; mental health. Each day I'm walking &amp; running about 2-3 miles everyday, had done a low carb diet, exercise daily inside, take protein shakes and better foods to help my muscle growth and have lost over 15 pounds! Most days I feel that I can run a whole mile without stopping! Heck, right after I finish the daily runs I almost cry in joy of how much I push myself to improve on my endurance. Now I'm doing lower body and can feel my butt and thighs being considerably smaller! In fact I was so fat I was a size 36 X 30, now I've forced myself down to 34 and now use a belt  to keep my pants from falling down when I run 🤣😂! 


👉 I've recently done meditation &amp; using candles for ease of mind to calm myself &amp; destress. It's worked quite well and I always found it never would work but was wrong. 

👉 I now can even identify abusive people's behavior through family/acquaintances/coworkers and have learned to steer clear or at least maintain the least amount of contact with them when necessary. I especially see it with my one  coworker (that hated almost ever since I started) and in my family. 

👉 Also have been into atheistic satanism on YouTube via listening to calming peaceful satanic chants and relaxing. I don't tell most people that because they're very judgemental and view satanic things as ""evil"" when they're clearly no different than any other religion. I might even buy the satanic bible understand it better but face constant scrutiny from family whenever I like something that isn't identical to what they like. 

👉I've spotted people that are AKA Energy Vampires that drag you down and waste your time daily! Most of it is from unstable parents and that I can finally get rid of when I move out. 

👉Have told myself to embrace the unknown &amp; different by trying to go for that second job to get out of my situation quicker. Unfortunately I can't take any job because it still wouldn't be enough to live so I've been applying to multiple workplaces that pay $10+hourly. Haven't heard anything except one interview with burger king (that wasn't sustainable) but I keep applying elsewhere.

b4fz8r,I don't know what to do. Please help me.,"I (21M) was in a 10 month relationship with my ex (21F). We met in college. She had been in an emotionally abusive relationship for 2 years where she was forced to engage in sexual activities with her ex (same college). Since it was her first relationship she wasn't aware that he was abusive. She tried her best to fix it and stay with him. After a point, she couldn't take it anymore and dumped him. After a year, we got together. Although she didn't show signs of having been abused in the beginning, a few minor things began to trigger her. Things like us getting physical or being sexually active. I never forced her and always made sure she felt comfortable.
I suffer from clinically diagnosed with anxiety and depression (about which I was not aware of at the time) and was riddled with insecurities in the beginning of the relationship. I was jealous of their relationship initially where I romanticized them and wished I was like him. I'd irrationally get pissed, jealous and judge her out of retroactive jealousy. She stuck with me through all that. 
She always felt angry when I told her I idolized him (I knew him personally as a friend before we had gotten together and thought of him as a cool guy, although I did on the inside somewhere think he was not really a good person). 
But as time went on, I began to see his true nature from her accounts of their relationship. I started taking medication for my anxiety and depression and things started getting better. But as things got better for me, things got worse for her. As she told me more about her relationship and got more and more triggered about us engaging in physically intimate activities, I began to see that she was showing signs of having been abused. I always had her back and made sure she didn't feel forced into anything. I read her expressions and didn't guilt trip her or make her feel ashamed. I took no for a no and was there for her. I researched as much as I could and I was the one to break the news to her. Initially she didn't believe me. She took her time to digest it. But it became apparent that her distaste towards physical intimacy was something she could not control. 
Since I am by nature a touchy person and love holding hands, kissing etc., I found it difficult to hold myself back. I socially conditioned myself to believe that my desires are sinful and tried to push them inside me. Our relationship began to seem like it was more platonic and romantic as time went on and I felt something was wrong. Finally, I reached my breaking point where my cognitive dissonance caused me to get depressed and angry. When I confided in her that I was unhappy we had no choice but to end the relationship for the better. We decided to stay close friends and help each other no matter what.
My appointments with my psychiatrist began to include mentions of her and her story as well. He told me that she is showing signs of a rape victim and that sexual coercion is synonymous with rape. When I told her this, she broke down and confided it one of her friends (who is studying medicine), who agreed that sex under duress is a form of rape. My ex at this point has accepted her situation and she actively does not like any form of romantic display of affection from me (I tried getting back together with her as we both still clearly love each other). 
I have severe anger management issues and I hate the guy who did this to her. I don't know how to move past this. I had thought of my ex as my wife more than my girlfriend in the relationship and it feels as though she was raped when we were together as all of her issues came out in the middle of the relationship. I had planned to marry her and have a future with her. Now, it feels as though the guy who did this to her has stolen everything from me. I feel powerless. I feel like I couldn't protect her. I feel like I should have asked her out before he did, in the beginning of college.
I see him from time to time and it triggers me. Throughout our relationship I have imagined killing him in multiple ways. I can not confront him, nor can I initiate a physical fight with him because it will drag him back into her life. Moreover the nature of their relationship is a secret and she doesn't want it to come out. I am forced to relieve my stress and anger through gym and physically fighting with my friends (we do that for fun like in the movie fight club). But the relief is temporary and I have resorted to smoking to feel better. I don't know what to do. Can someone please help me?

TL;DR
The woman I love was abused and she is showing signs of having been raped by her previous partner. We broke up but we still love each other. I feel like my whole future with her has been destroyed by him. I have severe anger management issues and do not know what to do.

b4gwm8,It's 2am and I just want to get things off my chest.,"This is most likely going to be a long and unorganized ramble. I'll leave a TLDR at the end. 

My whole life i've been nothing but tormented by my father. He has a history with drugs (thankfully not including harder ones, such as alcohol and cocaine), and currently sells weed from our home, along with my mother. I'm the youngest daughter he has, and he hasnt been a good father to any of his three children. My sister and I would be left with him during the day while my mother worked her shift at a bar, and he oftentimes wouldnt feed or pay any attention to us. This resulted in a lot of injuries, I have a scar on my eyebrow from a time I was unsupervised as a toddler because my dad wanted to nap, and I fell and cracked my skull open on a dresser. I also have a memory of a time I fell down the stairs (I couldn't have been any older than 5), and he only stood at the top of the stairs and yelled at me for crying. He made no attempt to help/comfort me himself, and instead made my mom return home early from work to help me. 
Other occasions I vividly remember include a time he pulled a knife on my sister because she had spilt some soup, or the time he shoved me onto the floor (I was still no younger/older than 5) just because I hadnt put a Hannah Montana movie back in the case. 
I began to realize the cruelty of his behavior around 6/7, when we had a rough year and my parents fought a lot. I witnessed my father groping my mom against her will/threatening to anally penetrate her several times during this period. My sister also ran away and became pregnant. My father forced her to get an abortion (which she at the very least would have needed anyway, because she was only 16 at the time.) I remember my sister self harming and drinking during this time. ( Thankfully she has recovered, and currently has two kids. She is still in contact with my parents regularly.)
My sister ended up calling the police one day, and we were temporarily taken into their custody. I remember crying so hard while being interrogated. In the end my parents won back full custody of us, and I blame myself for it. I should have entered the courtroom when I was given the chance, I should have told them everything!

Im crying now as I type the rest of this, so I apologize for mistakes. 

His physical abuse lessened once we were back from custody, but his verbal abuse never ended. Another vivid memory I have is when I was changing my shirt, and he saw stretch marks on my stomach and started laughing/teasing me. I have completely avoided becoming anywhere close to naked around him since, and have always been more conscious of my weight . He has always hated how fat I am, and is no stranger then and now to calling me names such as retarded, bitch, pig, stupid bitch, etc. He calls my mother these things as well, and when my sister lived with us she was subjected to such insults. 

The most confusing part of all of this is that he always insists he loves me, and gives me lunch money, new electronics, etc. Yet I can't find myself believing that he really loves me, because besides from materials he gives me I don't get much else from him but hatred. All I seem to be to him is something to take his anger out on. 

I've always been physically/verbally bullied at school alongside being what I believe to be abused at home, and as a result of this I have an incredibly low self esteem, and diagnosed anxiety/depression. I first began to become truly depressed in seventh grade, which is when I remember I first started to cut myself. In grade 8 my cutting involved into intentional bruising as well, and I eventually got in trouble with school staff for my cut up legs.

 In grade 8 I also remember my dad pushing me into the floor, and I retaliated by pushing him into a table, which he broke. He also shoved my mom, and a friend called the police over to my house. I lied to them and they left. He also threw me into a wall and removed my locking bedroom door, which he replaced with a non locking one. 

It was either grade 8 or 9 when my mom took me to get medical help, since I constantly had angry breakdowns, which had resulted in more self harm/attempted strangulation. I was put on venlafaxine, my dose getting up to 175mg at one point (currently I'm at 150mg I believe. My doctor has began to wean me off to prevent total dependence. I'm terrified of losing my meds.) I also had a few therapy sessions, but since I was not able to disclose the abuse I experience at home the therapy didn't really help, because my therapist didn't have the full story. So I dropped therapy. 

Grade 9 was when I discovered weed and alcohol. I haven't had alcohol since grade 9, but I have had at least two joints a day up to this current day since I discovered weed. I can't seem to drop the habit, since stealing weed from my father and smoking it is one of my only sources of happiness anymore, besides self harm, my mom and my pets. 


Currently I'm in grade 10. I haven't felt happiness for more than a day at a time since grade 7. My grades have plummeted (I went from being a straight A+ student to failing my math class), I do have friends but I never have the energy to do anything besides sit in my room and get high. I'm turning 16 this Wednesday, and I have nothing to show off. I don't have a job, I haven't gotten my learner's license, I'm doing terribly in school, I never go out and I struggle with human relationships. I just feel so trapped in this loop of struggling through the school day, then coming home just to get yelled at by my dad and get high. 

The reason I haven't reported my situation to anyone with authority is because I simply can't have my mom getting arrested (she sells weed with my dad), and I also have a horrible fear of losing my many pets (they are all properly cared for, I assure you. I'm very passionate about proper animal care.) Even if my mom weren't to get arrested we would certainly struggle to pay for ourselves on our own, and I know I would feel endless guilt for having my father jailed, because he supposedly loves me. 

TLDR; Ive been abused by my drug dealer father, and  bullied  at school my whole life. I am in grade 10, turning 16 soon, and am currently addicted to weed and self harm. I cannot escape my household out of fear of my mother being arrested (she sells drugs with my father) and losing my beloved animals. I feel completely trapped, I don't have a job, I never really leave the house, and my grades in school are quickly plummeting. Life isn't worth it anymore. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? How did you get through it? How do I become motivated and stable enough to get a job/license/good grades and move out?",LeaveMeAloneBitchass,2019-03-23 01:39:55,2,1282,35.97,25.86,88.85,3.17,20.03,16.69,91.5,57.8,19.97,17.08,12.4,0.78,0.16,3.35,0.39,2.89,4.84,13.57,9.28,5.15,7.64,2.34,16.93,3.35,1.95,1.25,2.11,2.03,5.85,1.72,4.13,0.94,1.64,0.86,10.37,2.65,0.31,2.34,3.35,11.54,2.42,2.26,1.25,1.95,1.56,2.81,1.4,0.39,0.23,0.62,3.43,0.78,1.95,0.31,0.86,6.86,2.26,1.09,2.18,1.64,0.7,6.01,9.52,0.62,15.29,2.03,6.63,6.94,2.81,0.55,1.09,0.55,0,0,0.62,0.23,0.16,0,0.16,0.08,14.51,4.68,4.91,0,0.08,0.23,0.08,0,0,2.11,1.56,0.86

b4kfmj,How to move on after 'not guilty' verdict.,"So my brother and I took our dad to court for abuse that we suffered as children. Because there was no physical evidence on our bodies as it had been more than 10 years ago when it happened, also each of us never saw anything about each other or told anyone, he managed to get out of his charges and the jury found him not guilty. (here in Scotland that laws are difficult about corroboration). We are both really struggling with this outcome because he now lives with other children and could be doing the same to them. As well as the fact that the defence lawyer called us both liars and it now looks the case from the outside as it was a closed court and his family weren't allowed in. I can honestly say the jury 100% believed us and cried at my statement (i went into a lot of detail to make sure I couldn't have made it up). How do we move on knowing he is out there and didn't receive any justice at all. It makes me regret coming forward.

b4pvpf,Abusive Boyfriend Advice,"Idk
Not really sure what I’m looking for other than someone to talk to about this. Backstory is my boyfriend has minor depression &amp; has been in anger issues since he was 11. We’ve been dating for nearly 16 months now and have had several physical incidents. He’s my first serious boyfriend and I truly wanted things  to last with him because I grew up with physically/verbal abusive parents and he’s tried to help with that. We’ve talked about doing everything together and plan/ned on going to college together. I’m 18 (5”5 Female) and he’s 17 (6”6 Male) now. A few months ago, we were in the middle of a fight in the car and just started punching my head. He realized that he screwed up and later that day after I had taken him him, he started choking me and banging my head on the kitchen counter. He apologized continuously and is on medication now. I foolishly of course believed this would be the only time this would happen. We were sitting down last night arguing and I threw pillow at him a couple times intending to get his attention while he was engaged with the television. Things only escalated from there. I was sitting and he took his fists and started banging my head on the wall and punching. I went downstairs and he came downstairs and started choking me saying, “This is is all your fault, bitch. Say it’s all your fault, idiot.” He didn’t let go for nearly a minute. Here is a picture of what it caused- my lower face is purple and I have these popped blood vessels all over my face (mostly eyes and neck).

b4s7ax,Was I abused?,"Context, 20F here, grew up in the Philippines, so yes, Asian upbringing, hello.

As a child, I was subjected to physical punishment whenever we did something wrong or bad—my father did. My mother did not ever raise her hand against us. Most of the brute force was from my father.

As kids we got in trouble for... well, kid things. I once hit my older brother, when I was ill with a fever, for calling me names. He tattled, and my father spanked me. My older brother and I got average grades—neither failing nor too low—and he hit us with the handle of a toy golf club—which by the way, was metal. During a mass, we needed to use the restroom so my mother and one of my brothers left for the restroom. He got angry with my brothers and I for leaving because other people occupied our seats while we left. We were hit when we got home. He used to feed my younger brother and I to make sure we ate, and one time it was a particular vegetable that my brother couldn't stomach that he ended up spitting it into the ground. I watched while my father scoop the spat food back into the spoon and shoved it in his mouth. I was scolded for not singing during mass or first communion practice—it was true that I did not sing during mass, I don't know why, but during practice I did—I liked to sing. I could go on, if my memories let me remember or if the person in the back of my head let me think into it. 

I'm asking because it just feels like, to this day, whatever I went through still affects me. I am anxious when I am alone with my father. I try to avoid him best as I can when he is at home. I am only ever comfortable around him if other people are present. I constantly feel like I'm tipping my toes whenever he's around. He does not take it well that I have depression. He doesn't understand. He has told me that I have no right to be depressed. He has misunderstood my anxiety attack as me just crying because I did not get what I want.

I don't know if I was abused or if this is all just discipline. My second voice says it isn't. It's all just discipline. It does not think I was abused. I am told that I went through that because I was a bad child. I don't know anymore.",lunasea__,2019-03-23 20:59:14,4,437,10.29,22.51,89.04,2.18,13.66,14.42,94.97,63.16,25.4,19.22,13.5,2.29,0,3.43,0,6.18,3.89,11.21,10.53,5.95,8.47,3.43,20.82,4.35,2.97,2.29,1.14,0.92,5.95,1.6,4.35,0.69,1.37,1.37,12.13,2.97,0,0.69,5.72,12.81,2.52,2.29,2.06,2.75,1.37,5.03,2.06,0.23,1.14,0.69,3.2,1.6,0.69,0,0.92,10.3,4.35,1.37,2.52,1.6,1.37,8.47,10.3,0,12.81,1.37,5.49,6.41,0.92,1.37,0.46,0,0,0,0.69,0,0,0.23,0.46,0,14.19,7.55,4.12,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,2.29,0,0
b4sdtr,Tapering and trapped,"I’m really really scared to be posting this right now...I’ve kept this a secret for a long time...

Being a victim of abuse is really hard to come to terms with being a man. 

I won’t go into my horrendously long story: I’m just hoping someone might see this and could maybe nudge me in the right direction.

I am regularly verbally and physically crapped upon by my girlfriend and her 8 yr old daughter. I have never spanked or beaten anyone, and I don’t tend forwards anger: I, instead, get panic attacks. Severe ones.

My girlfriend and her daughter are some of the most angry females I’ve ever met: I’ve had about 7 other girlfriends throughout the past 20 years, so I feel I’ve got a decent barometer of things: like I said, I don’t need to go into the backstory: trust me, I’ve been abused bad.

It all happened over 5 years and really came on slow and sudden at the same time. Man, it’s just really hard to finally stand up and say, “I’m being abused! This has change!”

It’s not that I haven’t thought this before, but...my father died, then my grandmother, and my entire support system collapsed as I was moving halfway across country for work.

I’m in a small town now, with a car that works but my girlfriend’s car needs the brakes fixed and I it’s just hard to leave her when she doesn’t have a working car, especially since has a daughter.

I’ve raised the daughter from ages 3 1/2 until present (8). I’ve been so good to her and she loves me very much, but she really has a pretty intense anger problem for a little girl (her real dad is a real jerk. I don’t blame the little girl for being angry in life, but I’m personally so good to her).  Leaving my girlfriend would mean leaving the girl behind. It would be really hard for me, but I’m an adult: I’ve dealt with some tough loss. I’m scared so much that if I leave, it will scar the little girl forever...I’ve been so good to her through crucial years when her dad really treated her like dirt and barely talked to her, we’ve just bonded. Ugh...that’s one of the hardest parts.

Then comes another challenge: when my father died, I really really tanked, and was prescribed medication from a doctor. I’ve been on this medication now for a few years, and it’s a medication that’s crucial to taper off of slowly.

Thankfully, through all the abuse and madness, I’ve managed to reduce the amount of medication I was taking for panic disorder by 90%!!! I’m almost completely off, but these last few cuts are really crucial and I need to be a calm safe place so I can get off of this crap and move on with my life. Until I get off I have to be near my doctor as tapering off of this med is serious stuff!

I’m about 3-4 months from being entirely prescription pill free! Being stuck on this medication while delicately tapering off due to enormous physical discomfort, I believe is something my girlfriend has used to her advantage. I was what you might call the dominant person in the relationship, until I got really sick after my dad passed. I was sick for a few months and in that time she just grabbed the wheel.

But she has come to resent me for it all. I work remotely and have now for 5 years. I work my tail off weekly, I’m so supportive of my girlfriend and her child, it’s exhausting how much I’ve laid down for them.

Most times they bring me joy, but the dark moments of physical and verbal abuse have happened so many times over the past 5 years that it’s definitely a big ass problem.

I can’t defend myself. First of all, I’m still a bit fragile from all the traumas (won’t go into it) I’ve faced in life that I’ve worked very hard to grow beyond  by quite a bit. Secondly, i dare not defend myself anymore: if I do, either the girlfriend or her daughter will get so loud or physically violent, that I become terrified that a neighbor is going to hear them, call the police, haul me off to jail, where they won’t take my tapering seriously, and it could be really really bad on my, thus far; very successful recovery from deeeeeeep grief.

Other problem: we share our work and our clients together. She currently handles all the money, has my car in her name (long story), now only has herself covered with auto insurance so I’m not able to drive, and treats me as though I’m using her for her money! I make more money than her, but since she handles it all, she can really manipulate me into feeling like a nobody.

When she loves me, she is the best! I know it’s hard to be in her shoes with a child and a worthless ex, but I have been around so many people in my life and relationships: this is the most serious abuse I’ve ever been through: it has left me terrified to talk to anyone but her. I am afraid to call my family or friends, partially because I’m really frightened to talk seriosuly about my being abused...it’s so humiliating, and if my close friends caught wind of how bad it is, they would really badger me to leave this woman.

Which is exactly what I believe I need to do (I’ve tried for 5 years), but I’m broke without her for now (she controls all $$$) and we share clients...

My plan for now is to try and obtain a decent paying job in a nearby, but 2 hour drive away city, in a clandestine manner and just be as agreeable as possible until I can get out.

I’ll also have to save up a little bit of money.

Many times a part of me just wants to escape (we aren’t on a lease together, we don’t have children together, and I could sell a few things enough to at least get myself out of here).

The little girl likes her grade school here and I don’t want that to change, so I’m going to be the one who has to go.

Ive just never been in this situation; being abused, while tapering off of sensitive medications, in a relationship that if I leave will break my heart, destroy my current client base, and possibly hurt the little girl. Lastly, many times I’ve been afraid to leave her for what she might do to me if I did!

Yikes!

This is a first for me, in these 5 years, to finally reach out to Reddit. I’ve seen so many quality responses to other peoples’ posts like this so, thought maybe some of you might have some advice.

I’m near Los Angeles, and am looking for work down there. If I could land something really solid $50-80k/yr, I could easily move. At this point, I’ve even considered a homeless shelter (since there’s almost no battered mens’ homes),

I have a few friends in the area (originally from the Midwest), but I’m really really shy and scared to tell them: 1. I’m being abused 2. I need a place to stay.

I wouldn’t be posting on Reddit if I felt like I had another person or place to talk to about this. I once had a thriving social life, and savings, and great credit and health. 5 years into this relationship, I’m barely recognizable to who I once was. I’ve seen and endured a lot of darkness in the past 5 years, and am very proud of myself for not losing my mind! Was NOT easy!

So am I overreacting?! What the heck do I do!! I’m a 35 yr old guy, people don’t take this kind of abuse seriously. They prey on my sensitive nervous system (panic disorder). I worry sometimes that their treatment of me will literally break my heart. Like, heart attack, just because as a man in today’s world, when it comes to a girlfriend and a child, you’re absolutely defenseless if you want to stay out of jail.

You just have to take the beatings until you can find a new route, but through this relationship I’ve lost a lot
Of my ability to trust anyone. I think she’s really really screwed me up and brainwashed me and I won’t even see the full scope of it until after I get out.

b4t9iu,How wrong am I for this?,"I’m drunk so I’m gonna try and get this out the best I can. I dated an asshole for 5+ years who physically, sexually, and emotionally abused the life out of me. He’s hurt so many fucking women. So many have reached out to me to talk about it and it really breaks my heart. I got super drunk and exposed him on Twitter (so stupid and immature, I know) because he tried to message me after putting his ex wife and baby momma on blast after their divorce. I tweeted that he abused me in every way and has destroyed so many women in similar ways. I woke up to tons of messages from his mother, sister, and other family members saying that I’m a liar and need to grow up. Most of these people don’t use Twitter, so he sent it to them for the pure purpose of lighting my ass on fire. I just got tired of keeping it to myself I guess. And I just know he’s gonna go after some other poor girl that doesn’t know any better. He threatened me with “info” he has on my current boyfriend that would “ruin his life and his family could never recover from.” Basically he threatened me into deleting my tweets and tweeting that I lied about everything. So now everyone in my small town thinks I’m a fucking liar who made up a rape/abuse story for attention (other than the few amazing women who reached out to me before/after the fact). Idk what I wanna get out of this post. Just feeling super low lately and drunk right now. I haven’t felt the same since all this happened. I’m a mess. I feel like a fucking g idiot for ever giving him the satisfaction of knowing he ruined me and knowing everyone still hates me for the bullshit lies he’s spread to ruin my name. How wrong am I for putting my personal business out there? I know I should’ve kept it to myself and continued suffering in silence (3 years later btw), I just wanted to get this out there. Don’t be afraid to go harsh on me, I think I really need/deserve it right now.

b4tx4k,Scared to take the next step: reporting,"A month ago, I finally got the courage to go to an organization that helps abuse survivors. I wanted to go to get legal help on my situation which occurred a few years ago. Later on that week, I was contacted by an advocate who would be by my side throughout. But well, I haven't contacted them back yet. 

All the memories just poured back in, and I began to doubt how successful it could be. All I have against him really is that I repeatedly told him no before anything escalated. During the abuse, I was scared he could do much worse to me, so I didn't fight back much. My behavior would probably be deemed as consenting or at least normal because I was in denial, which is where I'm really doubting myself here. They could leverage my behavior after the fact in their favor. I'm so scared of really pushing this into reality. Of all the hounding and being framed by the defense in order to make his case if we go all the way to court. There's also another thing lingering on my mind too.

Where I live, a convicted sexual assault is 2 years jail time. And I'm like... Do I really want to put this guy into jail? I'm really going to disrupt his life if I really go through with this. But then I recall all this time I've been struggling emotionally &amp; socially because of this. I've gone to therapy and been diagnosed with depression, but I don't know if that's enough either, or that it can just be deduced from other factors in my life, which is definitely yes. He's effectively stunted my growth in these areas because of what he did to me. But I still have this... Idk, altruism in me where I don't want to go so far as to make him go to jail for it. 

I don't really know what to expect by posting this. I just needed to get this out of me. Maybe talk some sense in me to not think so kindly for him at my expense.",WholeWheatBricks,2019-03-24 00:58:46,1,361,22.99,10.14,93.71,5.28,14.44,13.85,92.24,64.27,22.16,14.68,11.08,0.28,0,2.49,0.83,7.48,3.6,16.07,10.8,8.86,6.93,2.22,18.56,4.43,2.49,2.77,0.28,3.32,5.82,1.94,3.88,1.66,1.11,0.28,6.37,0,0.28,0,2.77,16.62,2.49,2.22,3.6,3.05,1.94,6.09,0.28,0,0,0,1.66,0,1.39,0.28,0,4.99,1.11,0.55,1.11,1.39,1.39,4.71,12.74,0.83,16.62,3.88,7.2,6.09,1.11,0,0,0.28,0,0,0.83,0,0.28,0.28,0.28,0.28,15.79,7.48,3.32,0.28,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,3.88,0,0.28
b4v05l,I could get over the abuse if he was apologetic,"My boyfriend doesn’t hurt me often, mainly just during heated arguments. And he doesn’t hurt me too seriously. Just smaller things like grabbing my neck and occasionally hitting. He would never seriously hurt me or beat me though. 

Today we got into huge argument and i walked off from the car. He was trying to drag me back to the car and i refused, so he grabbed me by the neck and lifted me. He also left finger print bruises on my arms from grabbing me and trying to take me to the car. At one point he slapped my cheek i think. I just remember being too angry and not wanting to be anywhere near him. 

I can get over him hurting me even though i don’t like it. But the thing that bothers me more is when i show him my bruises or scratches after a fight and he doesn’t seem too affected. Today i told him the bruises on my arms were painful and he didn’t seem too sorry. He said sorry but i don’t think he cared that much. It bothered me so i brought it up again and he got mad i said it twice. But i just wanted him to feel bad for hurting me. 

Anyways he said he’s not gonna touch me during fights anymore but idk. When he’s really angry it’s his impulse to squeeze my neck. Well see. I don’t want to leave him. Just needed to vent.

b4vjh1,I can't take people seriously when they apologize to me anymore.,"Obviously, if you are my friend and you apologize, depending on what it is, I'll probably let it go. But since my step dad apologized literally hundreds of times only for the same exact thing he apologized for to happen again and again, it left me feeling like apologies mean absolutely nothing to me. I've come to learn that letting an action go because they apologized and actually absorbing the apology as something legitimate are different things to me. In my head, they obviously don't actually mean it, they are just saying it to relieve their guilty conscious. As long as they feel better, it doesn't matter how hurt ***I*** feel. And it sucks because someone will actually have a sincere apology, but I can't take it seriously because they are obviously just acting so I can be the one apologizing because they've made me feel bad and I just wasn't considering how **THEY FELT,** even if I was in the right. I can't ever fucking win and I'm so tired of it.

b4vzr1,i really just need to let this out before i explode.,"I'll start off by saying all this started when I was 21 and I had a 2 year old son at the time .

me and my ex started out talking on Facebook, I knew of him and I knew he was dealing with a tough break up. we talked for a few months before he came over one night to hang out, we ended up having sex, he was so nice that night and the next morning, but as soon as he left that first morning shit was never the same.

I got ghosted for a few days before he messaged me, as soon as he did it was about he hated a guy I'm friends with, the guy was dating hos ex at the time and I knew he wasn't over her so I got the hurt. he told me that he liked me but unless I cut the friend out he wanted nothing to do with me. now looking back I see this was the first huge red flag, but I understood where he was coming from so I stopped talking to my friend .

I thought cutting out one person would be enough, it wasn't.  within a week and still only having hung out once, he'd message me and freak out if a guy commented on a photo he'd accuse me of fucking them. 

he ended up having to move out of state for a few months, this was 3 weeks after we'd hung out the first time and we'd only hung out twice, why I kept trying I will  never know. I should also mention at this point there was a lot of hot and cold, one minute he'd gush about how amazing I was and how he wants to be with me to him telling me he was too damaged to have a relationship with me.

I still kind of had a life well he was away though, we'd end up fighting alot about it. he hated that I wasn't staying at home all the time, hed tell me I clearly didn't care about him or I wouldn't be hanging around my whore friends . 

what ever as bad as this was I ended up dating him long distance, when he moved back to the state I let him stay with me till he got a place, it lasted two weeks before he found a place and dumped me .

we were broke up for about 6 months, but it was six months of pure psychological torture and emotional manipulation. after he broke up with me I was tagged and pictures on Facebook and there's a guy kissing my cheek, he message me that night telling me what a whore I was and how I never cared about him or I wouldn't have moved on so quick. most of the six months he come over for a few days tell me how much he loved me and how we are pretty much together we just don't need it to be Facebook official, then the next he be hanging out with his ""friend"" and telling me I need to move on and leave him the fuck alone, at one point he texted me and told me he was going in the woods to shoot himself and then turned his phone off he didn't and had no intend on it. and at the same time he's fucking with my head with his emotions, his control over me hits a new high, keep in mind we're broken up at this point end every time I go to hang out with my friends I get messages just freaking out at me for being a whore. I'm not going to go to into detail but I already had pretty severe PTSD from childhood trauma to start with and honestly by the time we got back to together I had issues with bulimia, which honestly I hate to say it but made me feel so much better . 

we ended up getting back together, that's when the physical abuse started, I honestly don't remember the first time he put his hands on me cause it started small. the first time I remember , we were at my friends apartment, one of my girl friends wanted me to go outside to talk to her about a guy, I said sure and went go outside, she was already outside and everyone else was in the other room, 

he followed me the kitchen,
him "" stay inside""
me thinking he just wants me to hang out with him"" I'll just be a minute"" and I go to reach for the door.
he grabbed me by my fore arm and twist "" if she's saying something that I can't hear then you don't need to hear it"".

I pulled away and went outside, a few seconds after I went out he stormed out and says "" dumb cunt "" as he passes and leaves. again I should have seen this is a huge red flag but when he started texting me after he left he just told me"" I thought she was going to talk shit about me I'm sorry I was mad."" about a week later he ended up moving in with my best friends boyfriend, so for a few months things were good, we still fought a lot over text but when we are together we weren't fighting as much because there was always people around. but that didn't last forever after about two months of him living with them he started a real where I wasn't allowed to be out of his bedroom if he was in his bedroom and less I had to pee cuz he was sick of me hanging out with them after he went to bed and then it started I wasn't allowed to hang out with them unless they asked his permission. oh and I should also throw in around this time I found out well we started talking and I wasn't even allowed to have guys on my Facebook he had sex with four different girls behind my back including dating one while we were broken up even though he swore on his brother's life they were just friends.

the abuse was bad when no one was around, I think the moment that stuck with me the most was he found out I was by his apartment but I wasn't visiting him so he called me a lot and when I went over he just fought with me so I tried to leave he pushed me to the ground so I was on my stomach and laying on my back and hold my arms back so I couldn't leave I was begging to leave crying until I started hyperventilating right after that he got off of me and within a minute his roommates came back so I had to act like nothing happened. the physical abuse stopped about a year ago he got in a fight with me and cornered me and I grabbed a pair of scissors and tried to stab him in the stomach, I didn't I tried to though I was terrified, I was back up against my kids bedroom door at the end of my hall way, he was yelling in my face,  but trying to to stab him scared him away from that.

I'm going to try to gloss over a lot more but the last couple years at this point I have no friends left I haven't been myself in a few years, and I let it happen and I hate myself for that, I haven't been myself in a few years I've always been such a vibrant fun person and my world has just been so grey. 

one day I had enough, I found out my son's father was having another kid, I was hurt, he hasn't had anything to do with our son for years, I spent a while crying cause I felt bad for my son, I called my ex crying and of course he didn't help me, he made me feel worse, he accused me of still wanted my ass cuz he told me there's no reason I should care about him have a kid if I'm not still in love with him. it hit me then, I've given up so much of my life for this man but when it comes down to it and I need him he's not even there he's just making me feel worse so why am I here? 

I thought the breakup could be civil we live on different sides of town and live completely different lives anyway, but nope, it's been two months and I'm still getting messages everyday begging me to come back, some days he's writing songs and telling me how much he loves me the next day im cold and heartless. i had to give up the few friends I had cause they were his friends, I've lost 40 pounds since December due to stress.

this is kinda long and I honestly just needed to rant but let me say, im fucking happy now.

b5194y,Is it abuse if he talks me into having sex with him?,"So first of all, I am male, I am heterosexual.

Someone I've been calling my best friend talked me into having sex with him. We were both kind of drunk when it happened. I still remember it though, not sure if he does. I don't know anymore what brought up the topic. He told me, I should try having sex with a man or I will never know if I am gay or not. He said I should try it with him, he could blow me or I could blow him, he said he already did it with someone else so they both know if they are gay or not. I told him I don't want that but he said something else and got his penis out. He said I should touch it to see if I like it and once again I said no. He said I should get mine out too and I did so. After more talking, I touched his and he talked me into doing more things. It ended after I gave him a blowjob. 

I don't feel bad or sad in any way when I think about it. When this happened I have already been 18. Sometimes I think about it and I think it was mean of him to do that to me but I wouldn't call it abuse since I don't feel bad about it, I also don't feel good about it.

A few weeks later it happened again but that has been the last time it happened. So it happened twice.

I think I did it because he was (is) my only real friend and I think I didn't want to feel rejected by him. I never had a lot of friends (still don't) and maybe he knew I would never say no to his proposal. 

To be honest, I've been questioning my sexuality ever since that time. I did go on tinder searching for other males, but just the thought of having a male sexually interested in me seems so strange. But I still go on tinder and other dating sites and search for other men.

Ive always known my father to be a bit temperamental, he used to beat me and my younger brother with a wooden spoon and once when he used it on me he hit me so hard a crack appeared. So he then turned to using his hand. Once I joined high school he added choking, punching and dragging me across the floor to the list. Things got worse when last year my younger brother tried to choke my father to death but my father let it slide but didnt lay a hand on him since. I had jaw surgery after a unrelated accident which means I had metal implanted, with a healing time of a year, in one of his outbursts he slapped me across the face knowing full well I only had the operation 3 months ago at the time. Yesterday he dragged me by my hoodie across my bedroom floor and down the stairs backwards. 

Hes never apologised and tells me im to blame. I told 3 adults when I was in primary school and none of them done anything to help me which started the thought process of this happens to everyone or its normal.",Stick_ofDestiny,2019-03-24 14:44:42,5,218,48.26,40.95,89.24,18.96,21.8,14.68,91.74,55.96,22.02,16.51,11.01,0,0,5.05,0.46,5.5,6.88,13.3,5.96,4.13,8.26,1.38,16.51,5.05,2.75,2.29,2.29,1.83,2.29,0.92,1.38,0,0.92,0,11.93,2.29,0,0,7.34,10.09,2.75,2.29,0,2.29,1.38,1.83,1.83,0.46,0,1.38,4.59,1.83,2.75,0,0,5.96,1.83,0.92,2.75,0.92,0.46,9.17,6.42,0.46,17.89,1.38,7.34,9.63,1.38,0,0.46,0,0,0.46,0.46,0,0,0,0.46,0,6.42,4.13,1.83,0,0,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0
b527ah,Was this abuse?,"A little context: 

I lived (and still live in) a house with  3 bedrooms, and at the time there was 5 of us in the house. My parents shared a room, my bother had his own room, and I had to share a room with my sister, who is 4 years older than me.

Now, I don’t really know if at the time my sister had any mental problems and I assume she did. 


So, this whole thing started when I was around 9ish, but when I hit about 11, it got physical. 
My sister at the time (15) would easily get mad at me for the slightest of things (not keeping my room tidy - which I did, not knowing where to put her stuff ext.) and would over react A LOT. Actually, to the point where it got physical. She would punch me, kick me and on a couple of accessions, strangle me. She would push me against the wall, and strangle me. She would keep it quite and basically took advantage me. 


I never told anyone about this because I’m too scared because I hate it when people get told off. She took advantage of that, I think. 


Whenever I tried to bring it up, she would always deny it, saying something like “Well, that never happened did it?” Or “Why would you lie about something like that?”. 


I’m now 14, I have my own room, and she moved out with my mum. I never got a sorry. She just acted like it never happened. She’s nice now, but it’s left me with mental scars. I now have major anxiety and I feel like this whole situation was a massively contributed to it. I now find it hard to trust people. 


But it was my sister. I’m just confused because it can’t be abuse if it’s your sister right? I was thinking about it and decided to ask you guys. My brother (whose only a year younger than me) also used to beat me up, and still does. I actually told a school councillor about this but he thinks because he’s younger than me, he can’t hurt me. 


I’m just young, and confused and I want answers. Thank you for taking some time to read this. It really helps.",Jakyboi3,2019-03-24 15:02:14,2,384,10.46,24.9,86.45,18.12,13.24,10.68,93.75,64.32,25.78,16.93,11.98,0.26,1.04,3.65,0,8.85,4.43,11.72,8.59,9.9,8.07,2.34,19.79,3.91,2.6,2.6,1.56,1.56,5.73,2.6,3.12,1.04,1.3,0.52,11.2,2.08,0.26,4.17,1.56,15.36,2.6,1.82,2.86,3.39,1.3,4.95,1.04,0,0.26,0.78,1.04,0,1.04,0,0,7.81,2.86,1.04,1.3,2.86,0.52,7.81,10.42,0,14.58,1.04,6.51,7.03,0.78,0,2.08,0,0,0,0.26,0,0,0,0.26,0,20.31,6.77,5.99,0.26,0,1.04,0,0.26,1.04,2.86,2.08,0
b53onl,Why do i likelistening to my parents fight?,"My dad and his girlfriend used to drink excessively, and his girlfriend would occasionally take drugs. When these nights occurred, a fight would usually break out. Instead of putting my headphones in, I would actually lower my music, and try to listen to every single possible sound I could hear. From the vibrations of my fathers screams, to the stomping on the floor, to the slaps and pounds from hitting each other. I found these sounds almost addicting. I could never stop listening to them. We eventually had CPS involved on numerous occasions, about two years later her kids were taken away and my father his girlfriend were required to attend a drug and alcohol program as well as an anger management class. Since then, the fighting has decreased significantly, but tonight I heard them screaming at each other. I could not help but turn my music off and listen to everything they say. When I hear them fighting, it makes me want to invite my girlfriend over, and just hold her and keep her protected and filled with love. I guess it also reminds me of the person who I do not want to be. Does anyone else have an experience like this?

b53pco,How Alice Cooper saved my life...,"First off, I was sexually molested by my stepfather from the ages of 8-18 and he even tried when I would visit after I was married as well. I dealt with this on a daily basis, it never let up no matter what I did and I started to become extremely depressed and desperate for something to change.

It got extremely worse when I became a sophomore in high school. The reason it got worse, I lost a bunch of weight then and slimmed down to a size 8 slim. Being a teenager dealing with not only the sexual abuse at home AND bullying in school was more than any person should be able to handle. Once I lost the weight, he started peeking in on me when I showered and the hugs were like if you had a frisky boyfriend. Instead of just wrapping his arms around me for a normal hug, he always tried to feel me up. 

Because I lost this weight, I wanted to shop at some of the stores in the mall and buy things like shorter shorts and vests. Now our vests back in the early 90's, were sleeveless and most of mine were denim. I thought they were cute but it did show more skin. I had to watch every step I took and everything I wore, because I never knew when something would happen. By the end of my sophomore year, I was going through so much depression at home I decided I had to find something to get away from everything.

Alice Cooper. His music was what saved me at a time when I didn't think I could go through another year at home. Yes, the abuse was still going on but once it stopped, I turned the music on and it became my shield. It gave me the strength to keep pushing in life. I have never seen him live in concert. However, my husband told me last night that no matter what we have to do, he will take me to see him in July. He is going to be close to us, well as close as possible. 

I didn't have any support at home, all I had was my music. I have no siblings, and not one close relative that actually cared about me at that time well other than my grandmother. The only problem there was my grandmother depended on my Mom to take her where she needed to go, so she was always afraid to make Mom mad. She wouldn't stand up against Mom but she did tell her that she didn't want my stepdad back in her house. That didn't last long though. 

My music from the time I turned 12 until I left home consisted of mostly Alice Cooper. He helped me get through bullying, sexual abuse, my mother fussing at me for any thing she could find and me dealing with becoming a young adult. I could turn it on and just fade away from the world. For those hours at night when I listened to Alice, I felt normal. I felt like nothing could ever hurt me. I felt like I had something to live for and regardless of whatever happened to me I had to keep pushing on. I wish I could thank him somehow, I am sure that he has heard this story before. 

For those of you out there dealing with abuse right now, try music. I know it might sound silly, but it helped me to keep pushing on in life. Those young ones if you are allowed to do so, I covered my walls in posters of Alice Cooper. I am not saying to turn to Alice, but find someone music wise that gives you courage. If you find that person that gives you courage, surround yourself with them. I had my locker covered in Alice Cooper and I would go by my locker after every class even if I didn't need to and open it. I just needed a little bit of courage to get through the day.

I am 40 now and the abuse I suffered, I feel has stunted my brain from growing into a normal adult brain. I have mentioned this before. I notice it more and more every day. It has been a long time since I have had to deal with that abuse everyday, but I still deal with it mentally almost every day. If I can say one thing even though I know he won't see it, Thank you Alice Cooper. You kept me from doing something that would have kept me from being here now. You gave me the courage to fight and keep fighting every day. You are still doing that now. Thank You",elasticheart1388,2019-03-24 17:21:58,9,804,32.99,29.2,87.36,20.15,16.75,11.19,92.91,61.57,22.39,15.92,11.07,0.37,1.49,2.74,0.25,6.47,3.73,15.3,8.96,6.34,6.34,2.11,20.27,3.61,2.61,1.49,1.37,2.36,5.1,2.36,2.74,0.25,1.12,0.87,9.33,1.37,0.12,1.87,2.11,14.18,2.74,1.24,2.99,2.86,2.36,3.48,3.36,0.62,1.49,1.24,1.99,0.62,0.62,0.37,0.37,4.73,1.12,1,1.12,1,0.5,8.58,8.96,1,16.29,2.11,6.97,7.34,0.62,1.12,0.87,0.37,0,0,0.5,0,0,0.12,0.37,0,10.82,6.09,3.61,0,0,0,0,0.12,0,1,0,0
b53y67,Bipolar friend gets harassed,"Hey guys, I'm posting this message throughout Reddit. I need some help and advice. My friend has been suffering lately from this case of abuse, and I'd like to hear your opinion.

Before he got accepted in a psych ward, some guy promised to help him (unlicensed guy, of course) and asked for a 1000 dollars. They met in person before he went to the hospital. He paid 200 upfront, but then when after therapy the dude asked him for the 800 dollars left for the psychiatric counseling. He's now threatening to communicate to every person on his facebook friends' list, which he took pictures of, that he has psychiatric problems, including former and future employers.

Funnily, the guy's been involved in scandals of child molesting before, ""smear campaigns"" according to Philippines' press. This guy is a publicly renowned entrepreneur in Manilla, and is working for a bunch of company. His record on the internet is pretty big. How do you deal with such a case? You guys would be of great help.

b54a9a,My siblings don’t understand why I don’t have a relationship with my mother.,"I want to preface this with, I’ve done a lot of work mentally and emotionally for myself. 
In 2014 I had a stillborn daughter and it broke me. It was legitimately the hardest thing I’d been through. Because I live in Texas I had to have labor induced (a fucking week later) and delivered my deceased daughter. During this time, I ended up spending some time in a psych hospital. My son (same dad) was very young and doesn’t remember any of this, thankfully. My ex husband filed for divorce while I was in the hospital at the advice of my mother. 
Initially I tried to make things right with her but I’d already gotten smart. She used to beat the ever- loving shit our of me on a pretty daily basis and is incredibly narcissistic. 
So far, she’s paying my ex-husbands mortgage and is constantly pushing him to fight me for custody of our son.
This goes way back y’all,
My earliest memory is her calling me me a worthless bitch (over a lost hamster) 
Years of hitting and being told how I’ll never amount to anything were straight terror. 
I have complex PTSD because of this woman. 
As a mother myself, I cannot imagine doing the things she did to to me to my son. I know she’s got mental shit going on but wtf?? 

I’m exhausted. I want a mother. My father has passed as well so I feel like I have no one guiding me. I’m just so frustrated.

b58jmt,sexual harrasment,"Hi reddit,

I'm an 18 y/o female and Saturday night I was at a party with a friend he is 22. So we where just chilling and it was nice to see everybody again. Later that night my male friend was sitting next to me and he got closer. Like too close for me. My boyfriend just broke up with me and he knew so I thought he just wanted to support me and help me. He knew I wasn't looking for any kind of relationship or sexual contact with anyone.

So after talking he was touching my leg and trying to get my attention. I just ignored it and thought he would stop when he saw I didn't like it. But he didn't stop and after I think 15 minutes he starts touching my thigh and going upwards. I never felt so uncomfortable. I didn't know what to say and he didn't stop. I was so disgusted with myself and with him I immediately left the party.

He knew I didn't like it. He knew I didn't want it and he still did it. I messaged him and said that I didn't like what he did and that I don't want to see him ever again. He responded that he didn't notice what he did and that he couldn't say sorry for something he didn't do. 

Also when I send him that message he immediately texted my other friend. He seemed very upset and even said he would report me at the police station. Like why would he do that?

I feel really alone and disgusted right now. I don't know if my friends will believe me or him. What are my parents gonna say? I'm so scared to hear 'why didn't you just tell him to stop?'",iespies,2019-03-25 02:45:11,5,301,1,43.4,53.96,16.29,12.54,12.29,97.67,65.45,29.57,22.59,11.96,0.33,0.33,9.97,0,6.98,1.66,7.64,10.63,9.63,9.97,4.98,24.58,3.65,1.99,2.99,1,0.33,5.32,2.33,2.99,1,0,1,20.27,0.33,1.99,0.33,10.63,16.28,4.98,0.66,2.66,2.99,1,5.65,4.65,1.33,1.99,1.33,1.33,0.66,0,0.66,0,7.97,4.98,0.33,1,0.66,1.33,11.63,9.3,1,11.63,1,2.99,7.64,0.66,1.33,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,15.28,6.64,0.33,0,0,1,0,0,0,6.98,0,0.33
b5ad26,I want peace of mind,"Hi. I don’t know who to talk to so I decided to post here. Also i’m new to reddit and i don’t use it so much so i hope i’m doing this right.
I’m the youngest in my family and I have an older brother. When I was about 9/10 years old, he started to tell me to do sexual stuff to him. I was so young I didn’t even know how sick that was or how wrong it was. It makes me want to vomit when i think about it. It didn’t last long cause at about 11 years old (i think) (for some reason i can’t remember most of my childhood, it’s like my brain blocked it) i felt uncomfortable and told him that we had to stop. I remember that when i told him he agreed with me. I also remember him telling me that it wasn’t wrong and that i shouldn’t tell anyone. 
I don’t want to get into the specifics of the stuff he talked me into doing but about a year ago (i’m 17)i told my mother about it. 
I started crying when i was telling her. She was shocked and didn’t know how to react. I don’t blame her. I told her not to say anything to him. She later told my dad. He never talked to me about it. My mother and I agreed to go see a therapist. I went once. ( they expensive) 
I haven’t had difficulty when i am with a boyfriend or a guy i like or whatever. I don’t think about it when I’m with someone i want to be with. But i don’t know if i will ever be able to tell my significant other about it. I dint know if in the future ill get married or something and i don’t know if that person will be okay with someone who has been abused by a family member. Is it ok if i never tell? I just don’t know what to feel. I just wish my brother pays for it in some way. Is that wrong? I don’t hate him and i guess these things happen but it still makes me sick if i think about it.

b5ck4h,Did something happen in my past or am I overreacting?,"I am a female and deal with anxiety and depression. 
Few days ago, survivors of child molestation talked about their experiences. I sympathized with them and my heart really broke for them as they were talking. Afterwards, however, I begin to feel extremely anxious and threw up.
 
There were always some odd signs growing up but I've always dismissed them and never acknowledged them. After listening to the survivors' stories and reacting the way I did, I begin to acknowledge that these signs were slightly odd.

So to start, my grandparents raised me when I younger until I immigrated to the US. Growing up, I remember doing this specific movement against my upper torso unconsciously and feeling really nervous / like something dark was consuming me when doing the movement. Despite these feelings, I continued to unconsciously do these movements throughout the years (less frequently as years passed) and now I rarely make the movements. I also begin masturbating frequently at 5 years old by squeezing my legs together. Furthermore, I have a lot of male friends and am close to a lot of them, but freeze and get very scared / nervous whenever a male touches me and the touch does not feel ""brotherly."" I also freeze and automatically start to cry whenever someone gets drunk (in real life).

When I visited my grandparents over the summer, my grandpa grabbed my butt and squeezed it (common action considered ""endearing"" in my country) but I felt really disgusted afterwards as it felt like he was ""feeling"" me. 

I don't remember anything. I also don't get nervous when I see a sexual abuse scene in movies. I've been feeling very anxious after hearing the survivors speak. Please help.

b5dd4v,I (34/F) am feeling guilty for separating from/divorcing my abusive terminally ill husband(35/M).,"I posted this in /r/relationships but the mod's said it would be a better fit in here  (which kinda makes me upset because I know it won't get any where near as many eyes in here due to the number of subs)

Throw away account for all the reasons people use throw aways (honestly if you just read the post you'd understand why). My apologies for the length. TL/DR at end. I want to say first off, as of July,1 2018 he no longer lives in the home. The state I live in requires a couple to be separated for 1 year prior to petitioning the court for a divorce IF they have children together. So I have not filed for divorce, I am however planning to. SOME BACKGROUND: So, this whole relationship was tumultuous at best. I met him when my oldest was 2 (she’s almost 14 now). I had super low self esteem due to childhood sexual abuse and trauma and I had decided I was only going to have one other father to my children and I was adamant about having the rest of my children before turning 30. I was looking to settle down when I met him. He was looking for a way out of the city he had spent most of his life. There were a lot of red flags from the very very beginning and in retrospect I should have walked away or let him walk away a thousand times before it finally happened, but due to my own past and experiences I was lulled into thinking this is what I deserved.
I am not going to get into every detail of every physical or verbal altercation. I am going to give you the highlights.
2008- He grabs me by my throat and has me bent back over a balcony with a 30 ft drop.
2010- I wake up to him threatening to drown our 2 month old in the toilet because he wouldn’t stop crying (he was premature, emergency C-section and had colic) I grab the baby, he tries to grab him back, I back up, he pushes me into a sliding glass door with the baby in my arms
2012- CPS gets involved due to my mother or one of her friends reporting that husband threw my then 2 yr old (Same kid from the 2010 incident) on to a bed leaving marks on his arms and a bump on the head (I was not in the room or even at home when this incident happened, I was working and pregnant with my 3rd child) He coached the oldest (she was 7 at the time) on what to say to CPS and the investigation was closed.
2013 (approx. I don’t really remember the year it could have been 2014)- He flies into a rage threatens to commit suicide (mind you he has done this periodically throughout the relationship but mostly I chalked it up to attention seeking behavior and became so desensitized to the threat I didn’t react) Our children were home. He drinks a full mason jar of moonshine, and half a bottle of advil. Once he was out of it enough that the threat of physical harm to me or the kids was diminished I called 911 and the ambulance and police came, they took him to the hospital and he was admitted to the psych ward (he spent a week in patient, and was diagnosed with Schizophrenia and various other physical health issues) The police spoke to my daughter who was 8 at the time and she explained that she and her brothers had been instructed by me to go upstairs and stay in her room until directed otherwise but they “heard everything”
End of 2013 I was pregnant with the youngest boy, the husband had accused me of cheating repeatedly, and I refused to let him see my phone. He became livid and began choking me and tried to smother me with a pillow (I sleep with a knife under my pillow due to my traumatic past) I pulled the knife out from under the pillow and cut him on the hand. He went to the bathroom (dripping blood all over the floor and the door to the bedroom) and proceeded to cut his hair off (I had been twisting his dreads for 5 yrs) which I viewed as direct disrespect to all the hard work I had put into maintaining his hair. (but once again that was the LEAST of my issues)
2014- I have the baby boy, everything seemed to be back to “normal” but I started having panic attacks. 2 to 4 times a month, hyperventilating, racing heart beat, body shaking, thought I was having a stroke panic attacks.
2015- I got a new job, that paid more but was also way more demanding on my time. He continues to accuse me of cheating and/or caring more about making money than being with my family. (mind you the whole relationship he has not kept steady employment and I’ve been working almost constantly to support the family)
2016- while cooking in the kitchen he grabs me by the throat and pins me against the back door, he puts a chef knife in my hand and tells me to just “go ahead and kill me, I know you want me dead” I refused, repeatedly and the grip on my neck just got tighter, THE only thing that kept me alive was that my daughter walked into the kitchen and he let go. He left for work, I called the cops, I filed charges, they picked him up from work, he was out the same night and staying with one of his coworkers. I FELT COMPLETELY demoralized and I was convinced he was going to come do something stupid. Next day, I filed a restraining order, but NEVER included the kids in the restraining order ONLY me. His father moved in with me to help out with the kids a month later or so and facilitated him seeing the kids (WITH MY FATHER IN LAWS’ supervision). Prior to the court date, I wrote him a 9 page letter basicly outlining all the things that had happened in our relationship and trying to show him/tell him where I was with the relationship, at the end I told him “I’m done trying. I’m done waiting for you to wake up. I’m just done. You had your chance to make this work, more than a few chances… and your own decisions have gotten us where we are. You want to keep forcing my hand to make a decision instead of doing everything in your power to CONVINCE me that being with you isn’t going to continue to be detrimental to my physical and mental health. So since you want a decision right now, as things stand… right this moment if you ask me to make a decision I’m finished I’m done I want OUT. I want to be happy and healthy and there is nothing healthy about our relationship. Don't give me the horse shit of you asked me about all this to “just know if we could work on anything” because the reality is… YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WORKING ON STUFF.. This letter gave you the fucking outline of what to do and how to do it…. You either shit or get off the pot…and I’ve given you years to figure out how to shit…. So now I have to make the hard decision to get you off the pot…. “
I went to court, and all he got was probation and anger management classes. I felt completely defeated, and like the punishment did not match the crimes at ALL…. Fast forward to the spring of 2017 I got talked into “talking to him” again by his father. I spoke with him and observed what I perceived to be a sincere change in behavior. Within about a month of that conversation he moved back into the house. At first everything was good, no yelling or suicide talk, no accusations of cheating when I had to stay late at work. Then all of a sudden he was accusing me of having sex with his father, and pretty much anyone else with a pulse, but when I tried to confront him about the accusations with his father present he tried to make me seem crazy. Things escalated, and in May of 2018 I asked him to move out, and gave him 60 days to find new housing. He moved out as of July 1….
Since he has left the house I have been the sole provided of the 4 kids, taking care of the majority of the bills (he has paid the phone bill 2x and the utility bill 2x that I am aware of). The agreement when he moved out was that he was going to pay the phone bill and the water/gas and I would take care of the electricity and rent and food for the house. He let the utilities go to the point people were in my front yard about to cut off my water. I PAID TO KEEP IT ON, he has never paid me back for that or any of the other times I paid the phone bill to ensure we could communicate. I have never asked him for cash or child support, and I allow him to talk to/see the kids whenever he wants (with supervision, which he’s not too happy about but, as you can see above that’s why) Every single time I bring up anything I need for the kids its always some excuse or bs reason why he can’t help out or doesn’t have any money. He makes seemingly out of place advances towards me (asked if I wanted oral sex on my birthday even though we hadn’t been intimate since May or June?). He has been increasingly moody and I noticed him using the same tactics he has used in the past to make me feel bad and “take him back”. Now to the present…. He has stage 4 kidney failure, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. We found all that out approximately 5 years ago. The doctors at that time gave him 2-5 years to live if he didn’t seek treatment or follow doctors advice. He’s still alive…. Obviously. 
Well here goes my guilt.
I was raised in a super religious environment and taught that marriage is a sacred vow before God.
Divorce was always demonized in my family (especially if the other spouse was sick)
I know I’ve been kind and understanding and have done everything I can think of to save the marriage (I told him we needed to go to marriage therapy but that I WOULD NOT find the therapist, because I needed him to show interest in repairing the marriage) but I still get the guilt trip from him, his mother and other family members that I’m “giving up” (please bear in mind these same people giving me shit have been divorced and remarried at least 2 times a piece and often times for WAY less serious actions than what their son/grandson has done)
I know he’s going through tough end of life things and I feel sorry for him but at the same time I feel like he dug his own grave, he made his own bed, he hung himself, so this is kinda what he gets. There is still part of me that just wants to see him get his shit together and act like a human being.
I do not love him, I do care about his well-being, mostly because of my kids. I just feel guilty for the timing. I need some encouraging words or reassurance that I’m doing what’s right for myself and my babies. 
TL/DR: My (34/f) husband (35/m) has been abusive both physically and mentally for years, I finally got up the courage to kick him out last July, but now I’m feeling guilty because he is terminally ill, and even though I know what I am doing is right for my kids and myself, I still hate the idea of anyone being alone when they are dying. I feel like he’s trying to gaslight and pity party me back into his life, and I’m not sure how to cope with all the conflicting emotions.",Tossthebucket12,2019-03-25 10:09:56,4,2103,57.36,58.09,58.27,11.12,28.42,12.89,91.54,57.73,18.4,14.88,7.94,0.52,1.05,5.09,0.29,3.52,6.7,14.69,8.32,4.66,7.09,1.28,18.02,3.61,1.85,1.38,2.38,2.04,4.37,1.57,2.71,0.71,1.28,0.33,13.31,1.76,0.1,0.52,5.47,10.89,2.28,1.62,1.38,2.57,1.43,3.28,2.14,0.52,0.52,1,3.33,1.14,1.62,0.29,0.33,7.37,2.19,1.47,2.95,1.05,0.38,7.32,8.75,0.76,15.22,2.43,7.13,6.23,1.57,0.48,1.33,0.9,0.14,0.43,0.57,0.33,0.19,0,0.1,0,13.12,4.09,2.95,0.1,0,0.05,0,0.48,0.76,1.57,2.47,0.67

b5ethp,I can’t remember anything. [16 M],"Cw / drug mentions 

So to start everything off, my mother has always been a drug addict, from probably around the age of 16. So her mindset is still stuck in that stage of life. She’s always been very emotionally and verbally abusive, and I knew of times she’s beat my sisters and things like that. 

I remember once I was messing around with her hair while a friend was over, and she kept telling me to stop, but I was just joking around and when I did it again, she hit my hand really hard. I didn’t think much of it, because I should have stopped. 

At times, I’ll tell my mom about certain things that I remember happening to us. (Car wreck, Her getting me a dog, etc) and she tells me that I’m crazy, and that she doesn’t remember, while everyone else does. I know its because of the meth. 

A while back, my sister and I were talking, and she told me she remembers my mom beating me, to the point where I was lying on the floor and my mom was kicking me in the ribs - to get back at my dad (since he and I were very close and she knew it’d hurt him). My dad ran me into my sisters room and told her to lock the door and to not let my mom inside. 

I brought this up to my grandmother, and she said that wasn’t the only time. My aunt said the same thing. They said that it was constant, and that any time my mom was even slightly upset with my grandmother or dad, she’d take it out on me and beat me. 

I don’t remember it ever happening. I don’t think I’m ready to, as even thinking about her doing that to me makes me start to cry. We’ll be around my mother’s friends and she prides herself on never doing anything to us (my sisters and I) other than spanks. So I feel like if I ever did bring it up, she wouldn’t remember. Sometimes I think of making her angry, just so she’ll do it again. I don’t know if that’s weird, or bad to say, but if I deserved it then, why wouldn’t she feel like I deserved it now?",g-j-b,2019-03-25 12:03:02,0,389,4.67,34.03,92.92,7.77,18.52,11.83,94.86,67.35,28.79,21.08,13.88,0.77,0,6.17,0.26,7.71,3.08,12.34,10.54,7.97,9.77,2.83,22.37,2.06,1.54,0.77,0.77,0.51,3.08,0.77,2.31,0.26,0.77,0.51,15.68,4.37,0.51,9.25,1.29,13.88,4.37,1.54,1.54,2.57,2.06,3.86,2.31,0,1.03,1.29,1.54,0.51,1.03,0,0,5.66,2.31,0.51,1.8,0.77,0.77,8.74,8.48,1.03,15.42,1.03,6.94,7.97,0,0.26,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.02,4.88,6.17,0,0,0.26,0,0.26,0,5.14,1.54,0.77
b5ihqn,family abuse,"uh, i dont know who to turn to or talk to at the moment, and i dont want to bother my friends...but im a closeted (nonbinary) transguy, im only out to my friends but my family doesnt quite understand. long story short i got outed by my family 4 years ago because my mom found out about me wearing my binder, and i tried to talk to her and my sisters about it but they're not really supportive. i even tried talking to my sister about it a long while back after that whole shebang happened but she doesn't understand and isnt really supportive. um, so i've just been trying to keep to myself about it.  


im 23, i live with my family at the moment. i dont really talk to my family about how i feel, or my personal life too much. they can be very i guess controlling, and manipulative. theres a lot to say, so im not sure where to start. i want to say i love my family, but as time passes by i feel like im just starting to hate them now. i think its more of me hating how they act and think more than anything. and im never really an angry person, or hold grudges, but its just really hard to forget the things that happened to you, that hurt you, y'know?  


um, like, i remember back in highschool, i had came out to my classmates as being suicidal, and they were supportive of me, so i  thought i should tell my family, so i could get therapy. all i got was grounded and reprimanded to just think positive from my mom. i used to paint a lot during those days, so she would often tell me to paint happier things haha. i got upset by it, and i wanted to go to my room to be alone, but i could never do that. my sisters would drag me out of my room, and force me to be in the living room. at the time, we lived in a townhouse, and had stairs, my room was upstairs, i remember almost vividly being grabbed harshly by the arms and dragged down the stairs. it hurt a lot.  


my family is very traditional, so they were type to give 'whoopings' if i was beign bad. i dont know if i got many or if i just really blocked off those memories. but they dont really do that anymore. at least not to me, but since we have cats, they tend to take it out on them, its not like beatings but they do slap them with a belt when my cats do something bad like pee on the carpet. i tried telling them that they should do that, but they never listen. and when i dont give my cats 'whoopings', they get upset with me. it's really frustrating. not too long ago, there was a few altercations, my family argue a lot, almost everyday (we're kind dirt poor so everyones always worried about money and one of my sisters is extremely selfish and lazy- she does literally nothing but sleep and complains about doing one thing/chores, and she gets really angry), but my sister (the lazy one, lets call her J) was arguing with my mom cause she uses up my mom's money a lot, so they were arguing, and they were ytelling and getting super close, so i was afriad they might starting hitting each other, so i tried to pull J away but she gets really mad at me, and she says something really uncalled for, i dont remember but it made me upset, and i just acted on impulse nad slapped her, she then proceeds to grab my neck and start choking me, i didnt do naything after that, my mom and my other sister (R) had to force her to stop. i still feel bad about slapping her, im not one for fighting and i dont like arguing and hitting, but sometimes i feel like she deserved it. its not the first time she put her hands on me. so i guess i was just really angry and did it without thinking.   


i try not be angry at anyone though, i dont like being angry and i dont want to be like my family. everytime they argue i get really anxious and shake a lot. for the past 4-5 years, ive been trying to be okay, and live up to their expectations, and do what im told. but it never is enough for them. but last december i hit a really bad depression slump, and felt extremely suicidal. i know i tend to feel depressed every now and then and its not like i can control it, but i usually pretend im ok nad try not to let things bother me. i dont remember much now, but i just remember J saying something to me, and there was so many arguments in last december that i guess it really affected me. i told my friends about my family, and they all said that they were manipulative and emotionally  abusive, even if they dont mean it. but i tried talking to my mom about going to therapy again at that time, cause i had a breakdown in front of everyone, i told her that i was feeling suicidal, and that i really felt like i might go through with it soon, nad it scares me. All she could say was that i needed to think positive, needed to go out more, etc, yknow, go do some yoga...that kinda thing. Both my sisters said the same thing too. That i needed to try harder in thinking positive. i get what theyre saying, but like ive been trying for years, for so long, and its not working. i dont know what else to do at some points, i just feel miserable, and like i cant do anything. the only thing keeping me going is my friends and my cats. so after that i just felt really awful. the only reason im here today is because i want to spend time with my friends, and iw ant to do things that i want to do.  


but, as much as im trying to be ok, i feel like im slipping, and i just cant be happy. my family ridicules me a lot, i cant be sad or upset, or cry cause theyll just tell me to get over it"", or that i need to stop moping around"". i cant cry in front of them, because im scared theyll be upset with me, so i always end up holding it in or crying when im alone (whenever thats possible). i dont really have much privacy here, and my family doesnt like my friends, and my mom has a curfew limit. everytime i do feel upset they always ask ""did you friends say something?"" nad its like, why is the first thing that comes to mind is my friends? i know we have our ups and downs but at least i can talk to them, and we can come together because we love each other, yknow? i know most of my friends are online, but theyre really precious to me, and we're always there for each other. theyre all i have.  


i have one friend clsoe by, but i try not to bother her much because im afriad my mom will cut her off from me. my mom cut off a friend of mine before, for really stupid reasons, she had a friend of her's stalk me on my facebook, and she saw something about me coming out as trans, and my friend was supportive of me, so my moms friend told my mom and she got upset and cut my friend off. she grounded me from being online, and using my laptop mulitple times too, and this was after highschool, when i was 19-21. so i dont talk to nayone much about my friends. i like to call my friends though, and we usually chat and have fun together. i try to do it when no ones home, because they like to eavesdrop on me. One time i was calling my best friend, and i was helping him with his homework, and my sisters eavesdropped on me, and eventually told my mom. so my mom tells me that my best friend is just using me, and that hes not a real friend. My mom always says that about my friends- how theyre not good people, how theyre not my real friends, and that the only friends i have are my family. i even met one ofm y online friends recently, back in november- i only told my family iwas just hanging out with my friend (C), cause we always hangout. so i came home that night,  and my sister (R) asked me how was my day, and i told her that i got to meet one of my online friends who was really nice. she didnt seem bothered by it, and she said thats good. but i guess she told my mom cause the next day my mom interrogates me about it, asking about my friend's gender, and how i shouldnt meet or have online friends, and that i was being 'secretive' cause i didnt tell her about it. i didnt tell my mom cause she wouldve just told me i couldnt go. she always says im being secretive, because i dont talk to her about my personal life. i tried, but everytime theres always something im doing wrong. why would i want to talk to people who never listen and never take me seriously, who always ridicule me, who get angry and upset at me for doing or sayign something?? every thing you say they make it into an argument, and they dont know how to actually talk. that's exhausting. i never talk because of this. im always quiet, but because of that im being secretive'. and its like, no matter what i do its never good enough.  


i dont know if i can type up everything, and i left out a lot of things, because there;s honestly so much that has happened. it's just lately ive been feeling realy tired and drained, and im feeling depressed where i cant fully enjoy myself with my friends, ive been crying for the past3  days about it lol....i jsut dont know what to really do at this point. i have plans, like, findign another job or getting more hours, so i can save up and learn how to drive, my friend said shed teach me, and i just want to move out of this place. but sometimes it just feels like ill be forever stuck here, and it really scaresme. it scares me becuse i feel like ill acually commit suicide if i stay any longer here.  


im sorry this is so long, and is maybe nonsensical words, but i just wanted to let out my feelings somewhere. i hope...i dont sound crazy. i think my family thinks im crazy, i guess i just want reassurance. but thank you to anyone who spends time reading this. im not doing anything rash i just wnated to talk about it to gather myself and thoughts.",ryooasuka,2019-03-25 16:59:31,4,1895,5.81,18.63,92.53,4.93,21.53,11.29,94.2,62.74,25.01,18.52,14.2,0.58,0.26,1.85,1.64,6.44,2.06,11.56,10.08,8.5,9.66,3.32,20.63,3.96,2.32,1.53,0.84,2.11,5.91,1.9,3.91,0.79,1.48,0.74,13.46,2.22,1.58,3.06,0.16,16.99,2.85,2.27,1.74,3.75,2.11,5.7,2.32,0.11,0.95,1.27,1.16,0.37,0.74,0,0,7.81,4.06,1.32,0.9,1.37,0.37,5.07,13.46,0.79,10.5,1.11,4.54,5.07,0.53,1.16,1.37,0.26,0,0.21,0.74,0,0.26,0.16,0.16,0.16,14.83,5.01,7.18,0,0.05,0.32,0,0.26,0.21,1,0.74,0.05
b5kep7,Ex boyfriend,"I went through an abusive relationship 5 years ago. He used emotions abuse, verbal, physical and sexual abuse. 

One of the things he would do is put on porn while we were engaging in sexual acts when he knew i did not want this. We never talked about it and he would continue even after I brought it up time after time. Additionally while watching tv shows and movies, he would speak about how attractive the women were and talk about their bodies. 

One time we hung out with our friend and got super drunk. We went back to his house and since we spent the day drinking we all laid in bed and what I thought would pass out. I felt movement and ignored it for a bit until I had a gut feeling and turned to see his hand in my friends skirt. Instead of getting upset, I felt obligated to win this situation and go for it.
She eventually got up and ran to the bathroom.

He would call his crack dealer and offer sex with me as a form of payment. The list goes on.

Lately, I’ve been having really negative and angry emotions regarding sex. I’ve been dating my current boyfriend for 3 years now and I’m feeling really guilty. I assume these emotions are stemming from the abuse and trauma but I can’t shake it. How can I get through this and enjoy sex again?",baeth0ven,2019-03-25 19:56:25,1,243,33.92,70.38,63.34,2.98,14.29,13.99,94.24,57.2,18.52,13.99,6.58,2.88,0,4.12,0.41,4.53,4.12,13.58,7.82,6.58,9.88,1.65,18.93,3.7,1.23,1.65,1.65,0.82,7,1.65,4.12,1.23,2.06,0,13.17,0,1.65,0.82,4.53,10.29,2.88,1.65,2.47,0.41,0.82,2.47,3.7,1.23,0.41,2.06,4.94,1.23,0.41,2.47,0.82,8.64,5.35,0.82,1.23,2.06,0,9.05,7.82,0.41,17.7,4.53,4.12,9.47,0.41,2.06,1.23,0.82,0,0,0.41,0,0,0,0,0,10.29,6.17,2.06,0,0,0.41,0,0,0,1.65,0,0
b5m835,Anyone else who has been sexually molested as a child find that they are completely avoidant of intimate relationships as an adult?,"I was sexually abused by a family friend on and off for about 3 years when I was 11. I find that I always project my fear of intimacy and emotional closeness with men by blaming them for why I don’t like them or why it can’t work out. 

I immediately assume that when they want sex or when things turn slightly sexual that they just want to have sex with me and leave. 

Since this recent realisation I’ve been trying to be honest with myself about my unhealthy associations between sex, intimacy, emotional closeness, and romantic openness with men.

In essence, I would love to hear about any of your stories and I would ESPECIALLY like to hear about how you over came this and whether there is hope that I will one day be able to form a healthy and emotionally intimate relationship with a man :) (I am 22 years old).",bananagirl910,2019-03-25 23:20:56,1,176,35.54,56.78,50.15,35.71,29.33,18.18,92.05,60.23,18.75,12.5,8.52,0,1.14,0,2.84,6.25,2.84,17.61,9.09,8.52,9.09,1.14,15.34,3.98,2.27,4.55,2.27,0.57,8.52,4.55,3.98,1.14,1.14,0,13.07,0.57,0.57,0,1.7,13.07,1.7,2.27,2.84,3.98,1.7,2.84,1.14,0,1.14,0,4.55,0,0.57,3.41,0,7.39,3.98,1.7,1.14,0,0.57,2.84,11.36,1.14,10.8,1.7,2.84,6.25,1.14,0.57,0.57,0,0,0,0.57,0,0.57,0,0,0,9.09,2.84,2.27,0,0,0.57,0,0,0,2.27,1.14,0
b5mqen,im so fucking unbelievably pissed right now,"my sister (29) has been married to her asshole abusive husband (45) for 6 years. In that time, he’s beaten the shit out of her, got her addicted to meth, got them BOTH kicked out if their house and were homeless for a year, cheated on her with not only a 23 year old, but a 23 year old who used to be my fucking classmate in high school, and had a kid that he barely gives a shit about. (oh yeah, he has so many other kids with with different women around where we live, and one of them just had A FUCKING BABY, WHICH MEANS THAT MY OLDER SISTER AND MY FORMER CLASSMATE ARE LITERALLY FIGHTING OVER AN OLD ABUSIVE GRANDPA).

He treats her like utter fucking shit and has broken her to the point that  im pretty sure she has stockholm syndrome or ptsd or something now. Just a few minutes ago, my younger sister showed me a video that fucking dickhead posted on facebook of my older sister crying and basically having a mental breakdown, saying that SHE WAS TRYING TO RUIN HIS LIFE. i got so fucking angry that all i could do was sit there, shaking with rage and with tears running down my face. this fucking asshole who tried to fucking murder my sister RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN INFANT SON is saying that she’s trying to ruin HIS LIFE. 

He also said that shes trying to stop him from leaving, and yeah, i can believe that, but he and pretty much my entire family know damn well that he just wants to fuck with her mind and always goes home a few hours later. hell, sometimes he doesnt even leave the neighborhood. sometimes he just goes to the abandoned house next door just to watch the house and see if she invited any dudes over. he’s always fucking playing these fucked up mind tricks on her and she goes for it every. single. time.

 i hate this motherfucker so much. im tempted to just make the 90 mile journey to her house just to make sure that fucker goes to jail. even his fucking mom doesnt want anything to do with him anymore. fucking asshole.",complexpriestesss,2019-03-26 00:27:29,3,381,43.16,60.36,11.87,1,21.17,13.65,94.75,52.23,19.69,13.65,4.46,0.26,0,7.87,1.05,6.04,4.46,12.07,7.09,6.3,6.04,0.79,16.54,6.56,1.84,1.05,2.1,2.89,11.81,1.57,10.24,0.26,8.66,1.31,16.54,3.15,1.05,5.51,4.72,9.71,1.05,0.79,1.31,3.94,1.84,2.36,1.84,1.05,0.79,0,6.82,2.1,1.31,3.41,0,7.35,2.89,1.57,2.1,0.79,0.26,4.72,10.5,0.26,15.22,2.1,6.3,6.82,0.79,1.31,2.1,0,0.26,0.26,7.87,6.56,0,0.52,0.52,0,11.02,4.46,4.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,1.57,0

b5tkpx,Please help I want to know if this is considered sexual abuse.,"So, my sister touched me when we were kids. It definitely didnt feel good, but i wasnt crying or anything at the time, just a feeling of awkwardness I guess. She would do so by saying ""I-ll give you this candy if you let me touch you"". She is 2.5 years older than me. 

I brought this up to her recently, and she has been avoiding me and told me not to call her again, and that she didnt remember that. But I know its a lie because when I brought it up once she confirmed it.

Now, I have psychological problems for the last 10 years, but I cant tell for certain if the roots of my problems are that experience, as I dont remember it to be overly traumatic,she didnt use violence, just a bribe.. the experience was uncomfortable I remember. But looking at it from now I definitely feel something odd. But my parents have been accusing me and telling me to piss off basicaly and leave my sister alone. I am 31 years old now and she is 34.  Is this considered sibling sexual abuse? Anyone had a similar experience, how did it affect you and how have you tried to ""solve"" it?

b5trcn,Why do I feel guilty? Why do I feel like it’s my fault?,"I just came out of a relationship with someone that I had been with for a year. First, I am not inexperienced when it comes to relationships ships. I’ve been in several long term relationships. I was even married for 10 years and my ex-wife and I remain good friends to this day. In fact I am still friends with almost all of those I have been in a long term relationship with. Most were all very healthy relationships. There were issues of course but none that ever left us never wanting to speak to one another...that is until now.

When I first started seeing this person, it was long distance. She lived in CA and I lived in WA. We talked for hours every day. It started off as friends but eventually we jumped into a relationship. After a year and a half and a few visits to one another she moved up here to be with me. That’s when everything started going downhill.

Almost immediately she was abusive, unstable and I discovered she had a severe drinking and pill problem. It was incredibly stressful. After 6 months she moved out and got her own place in hopes that would help things.

It just got worse and worse and worse. In fact I don’t think o have ever dealt with this kind of thing before. She punched me in the face twice. She threatened my job, my home, even threatened to call the police and tell them I physically beat her (I recorded this voice conversation for evidentiary reasons since it wasn’t true.).

To give you an idea of how horrible she was to me, I confided in her once that I was molested by my uncle and my mother when I was a child. During one of my ex’s drunken fits she told me “the only people that want to fuck you are your mom and your uncle.”

Yeah. She said this. I also took screen shots of this conversation.

I’m sharing this because I am a man, who was in an abusive relationship with a woman. I never once treated her poorly in fact I did everything I could to support her. I believed so strongly that if I could inject someone with love, kindness, understanding and patience that they could eventually see what I see in themselves. At this point I knew she had some pretty severe mental challenges and substance abuse issues. I convinced her to be sober and started going to meetings with her. This happened after a major suicide attempt she made where she was hospitalized. Unfortunately the behavior never changed. I’m pretty sure she is borderline.

It got to a point where I could no longer take anymore. It had already began to affect my self worth. It started to affect my performance at work and I stopped caring for myself.

Don’t get me wrong though I am by no means a push over or wet rag. I knew what I was doing and I made these decisions consciously. I thought I was doing the right thing by sticking by her side and taking the brunt of whatever she threw at me. I thought I was helping her by being supportive.

I’ve never in my life been in a relationship like this before. I did however grow up in a very abusive household. I had 3 moms and 3 dads (through various divorces and marriages) and almost all of them were abusive, physically, emotionally and sexually. 

I left home when I was 15 and built a life for myself. Generally I’m pretty happy with lots of amazing and good hearted friends, fantastic job, home and I don’t have any substance abuse issues. I thank my Grandmother for helping raise me because if it wasn’t for her I don’t know who I would be today.

This last relationship though did remind me of the relationship I had with my mother who was abusive in a similar way. In fact the two of them (my mother and my ex) shared the same birthday.

It’s been a little over a week since I ended things for good but why do I feel heartbroken? Why do I feel so sad? I should be angry and resentful and angry. I guess I’m sharing this because I don’t really have anyone to talk to. I guess I’m hoping for some resolution and advice on moving on and forward.

Thanks for listening.",Kidarkade,2019-03-26 12:03:54,12,757,23.55,47.36,77.98,23.7,13.52,15.85,95.11,60.77,23.12,16.12,11.23,0.4,0.53,3.3,0.66,7,4.1,13.08,10.17,5.81,7.13,1.98,19.68,4.1,2.11,2.38,1.98,1.98,7.53,3.7,3.83,0.66,1.72,0.26,13.47,1.72,0.53,4.36,0.53,12.95,2.64,2.11,1.85,3.17,2.51,1.72,1.72,0.53,0.53,0.66,1.85,0.13,1.06,0.26,0.4,7.93,3.7,0.66,1.59,1.32,1.19,8.85,8.59,0.66,15.19,1.98,6.47,7,1.06,0.26,0.53,0.26,0,0.13,0.66,0.13,0.13,0.13,0,0,13.21,7.4,1.72,0,0,0.53,0,0.13,0.26,2.38,0.79,0

b5yyv8,"TL;DR :How to stop being abusive? (redeem the past, ensure never again in the future)","My girlfriend broke up with me yesterday, and it was a long-time coming. It was over the phone and I broke my printer by kicking my chair into it. I have a problem and I need to fix it before I make further irreparable damage.

My first girlfriend I was with, I was abusive to the core. We dated for close to two-years. I manipulated her weaknesses against her, made her feel shit because every sign of her being strong made me feel weak. I said nasty shit to her all the time, i.e. if we ever get married I'm going to hang myself within the first month. And we were starry-eyed kids, and she told me she was definitely marrying me - so I took that piece of dream and used it against her. That's just a piece of the plethora of emotionally abusive shit I would do. I'm a self-diagnosed narcissist. If she ever slighted me I would act out, and say the most horrible, unspeakable shit to her. She was vulnerable with me, and I took it and ruined it.

She started dating online after we broke up, and hooked up with this guy over Skype because she was so lonely. She told me that I ruined her, and from now on she feels she needs to be weak for people so that they'll love her back. Can I fix this?

My second girlfriend, the one who broke up with me last night. I manipulated her secrets against her so that she would stay with me; she was stronger than the first, and would never put with my shit. But I found a way. (Most of the time the first month or two I would come across as the best possible version of me that I could, then when they open up to me I would consciously collate all their weaknesses so that when they've grown sick of me I would leverage that). And I did exactly everything I could to hurt her. I never physically hurt anyone. But I always had this way of conjuring up the worst, spiteful shit to say and then say it - and it was always like I was unconscious when I said it, and I couldn't believe the words that came out of my own mouth - but I was so desperate and pathetic and willing to bend the other person's arm (figuratively) to get them to feel guilty enough, scared enough, to leave me. I would also threaten suicide which I did try once with a rubber tube and my car.

I want to stop. This can't keep going on; I feel like I need to find something like the solace of my own soul before I be with anyone else. I am 21 years old and I don't want to put anyone through this again. This was very long-winded and rambling but I hope you got the outline of the wretched bastard I am. I write sometimes, which helps. But I'm trying to reach out and see if anyone else understands this... I have such a capacity to be resentful and bitter and manipulative, and yes abusive. I am trying my hardest to transcend this resentment and make sure I am never this person again. Ever. Be as critical as you like, God knows I deserve it. But any words of wisdom will be good too. How do I stop being abusive?

b63r2f,Am i overreacting?,"I'm not even sure if i want an answer or just wanna tell someone about this. It's kinda long because i think it all started when i started elementary school so it kinda falls into life story territory. So i'll just write it and if anyone reads it thank you. Also, i'm using a throw away account.

A couple of months before i started elementary school i figured out how to read by myself. This was proven to be a huge mistake afterwards. First of all my native language isn't very hard and i've met tons of people who learned how to read by themselves before school. But when i did it my parents started thinking i was some kind of genius. Also my teacher thought the same when i started school. 

I lived in an apartment complex rented to my family by the government. If you worked in a certain department in the government you'd live in this apartment complex and my dad worked there. And my elementary school was in that apartment complex. But the population there was small so most students would be from outside the complex. And outside, it was a ghetto. High rates of poverty and crime. And the students from there were either not very smart or just didn't care and got in all kinds of trouble all the time. So between them, school was pretty easy. Also like i said i'd learned how to read by myself so everyone thought i was a genius. (This was proven wrong later in life when i got to a regular high school with regular people) Also it didn't help that all 3 of my older siblings went to that school and they were very successful there and known by every teacher. And my dad was a very respected man in the community and also known by every teacher. So i was in the spotlight, ALL. THE. TIME.

And what did this result in? Getting my ass kicked by the teachers almost every day. Getting beaten up by teachers is pretty common in my country. And most parents, including mine, think that that is the only way to discipline a child, eventhough they never hit me themselves. I don't really know how many times i got beaten up but i think the number is in the thousands. Because of my situation no mistake i made went unnoticed. I would get beaten up for forgetting to bring my notebook while the other kids were lifting up girls' skirts and no one gave a damn. 

So my stupid 7 year old ass just got PISSED. I just rebelled. I would do my homework but not bring it in because i couldn't reward the teacher's behaviour. I couldn't let him think that beating me is gonna work and he's gonna get what he wants. To this day if someone tells me to do something i will not do it even if i wanted to do said thing in the first place and know that it will be good for me. It was like war between me and my teacher. We were both just trying to wear each other down. But this was not a bad man by any means. I always felt that he loved me and was trying to do what's best for me. I never felt like he was trying to hurt me and i saw it in his eyes that he was just as hurt every time he hit me. He was just kind of ignorant and he was told this was the only way to teach a child by the previous generation and he wasn't smart enough to question this. This was my life in elementary school and i passed all classes with straight A's. Like i said it was easy.

Then started middle school and it was some more beating from different teachers. Again, straight A's. Then i got in to high school and it was a lot better. In high school you wouldn't get beaten up unless you did something completely horrible. And there no one knew me so i never got beaten up. But at that point i was really shy and i hated school so i was always sat in the back minding my own businness, usually sleeping through the classes. Other kids would make fun of me sometimes but everyone made fun of everyone back then so i wouldn't call it bullying or anything. My grades took a dive the moment i got there but english was the most important subject in that school and it had a lot of credits and i was always getting A's so it kept my GPA high and i was able to graduate.

Then i went to university. Faculty of fine arts. The first year was really good and i was getting really good grades. Had a couple friends that i loved. It was good. The second year i went to a different country for an exchange program. And that's where shit hit the fan.

I loved the country i was in. I met a lot of amazing people and went to a lot of amazing parties. But i met 2 people who i think ruined my life. Or maybe i'm blaming them for my own fuck ups i don't know.

I met a girl from a different country and fell in love. And she claimed to love me as well. But she had a lot of problems. She would use my insecurities to make me feel bad. She hit me a couple times, i don't mean girly slaps i mean punching me in the face or in the stomach as hard as she could. She would force me to have unprotected sex and then blame me for it. Even claiming that i was trying to get her pregnant so that she has to marry me. Honestly i don't know why i took all of this i usually have no problem standing my ground. But with her i just took it all in. Until she dumped me when she got back to her own country. Funny thing is when we were together she made me promise so many times that i was not going to dump her when she went back home.

The second person was ""my best friend"". When i met him I loved him. We both loved drinking and talking pessimistic philosophy and we got along really well. But then i realised, this guy drinks. A LOT. He would get blackout drunk every day and force me to do it as well. And he would get really violent when he was drunk. Never got violent with me but i've seen him punch the windows of random cars, turning them into dust. So i put some distance between us. But the last straw was when he locked himself in the toilet with my girlfriend at a party and tried to force her to perform oral sex on him. That night i told him i'm not his friend anymore and to never talk to me again. I wanted to kick his teeth in but i was afraid of getting deported. 

He didn't take it well. But not like you think. He didn't get violent or anything. He was geniunely sad and begged me to take him back. Telling me i was his best friend in the world, promising to change. I said no. I had made up my mind. He started to send me weird stuff on facebook. Like child porn or ISIS beheading videos. (Never felt threatening tho, it felt more like he was saying ""haha isn't this funny?"") Still it was disgusting. So i blocked him. But he started following me around at night. Sometimes he would silently stay back, sometimes he would find the courage to come talk to me and BEG that i take him back. I never did. Again, honestly i have no idea why i didn't call the police. The thought didn't even occur to me at the time.

So after the first semester they went back to their own countries. Never heard from the guy again. The girl dumped me after ""trying"" to make it work long distance for a couple weeks. The rest is classic depression stuff. Drinking and smoking weed way too much. Isolating myself from society, antidepressants, therapy, trying to kill myself a bunch of times...

Today, almost three years later, i feel a lot better than i did before. I have no urge to hurt myself in any way so don't worry about that please. I have learned my lesson and have to live with permanent, embaressing scars on my wrist to remind me of how stupid that idea is. But i still feel broken beyond repair. Haven't had a relationship or sex after that girl. I'm actually thinking of getting myself chemically castrated and being done with the whole sex thing. Even the idea of sex gives me a lot of anxiety at the moment. My grades took a dive after all of that and my career is at the same point as the time all of that happened. But i try to survive. Sometimes i blame all of these people for my problems. And i really wanna hurt them. But then i realise eventhough they hurt me, i could've been a lot smarter about all of this. And maybe i can start being smart now and put things back on track.

b68xgb,Am I ever going to learn to trust a man in a relationship? Or am I just the kind of person who is supposed to get fucked over?,"I used to be so optimistic in love and happiness, and I still am I guess? I just don’t know anyone that can fill what my expectations are...

All I want is a guy that I can be spontaneous and laugh with and play with and who won’t hurt me, and won’t take life so seriously... someone I don’t have to settle for and I can feel genuine love for.

All my past sexual relationships have ended in my sexual assault or my self-esteem/heart being shat on.

My ex-boyfriend fingered me while I was piss drunk and I woke up the next morning without underwear on... he also had a habit of waking me up via oral or fingering... I was 17 and stupid and thought it was romantic. I didn’t realize it was wrong until after we broke up and I found that I don’t like oral anymore.

I “hooked up” with a guy that didn’t even kiss me, he just put his hands in my pants...

I had cross-faded sex with a fwb and he told me I was worthless to him and a waste of his time when I told him I needed time before I could commit to a relationship...

I trusted a guy that I felt comfortable around, and he told me to go fuck myself and that I should get “major psychological help” when I was reaching out because I was suicidal

I feel like I have no more respect for myself... I almost sold nudes to a stranger because I feel like my body has been used and thrown out by so many people I might as well just have a premium Snapchat or something...

I recently got drunk with 2 of my guy friends... I found myself cuddled up next to one and I found it strange that he never once touched me. I went home the next day and spent 45 minutes crying in the shower.

I want to be loved so bad, because I know deep down that I’m the kind of girl that doesn’t love someone half-ass. I pour my heart into people and they always take it and stomp on it and now I feel like I’m just going to settle for someone who does that forever.",broskymchoesky,2019-03-27 12:59:04,4,408,16.99,18.22,92.53,38.87,20.4,12.01,94.36,62.75,23.77,17.65,14.95,0.25,0,2.21,0.25,6.13,3.92,12.99,10.29,5.15,9.31,2.7,20.1,4.17,1.96,1.47,1.23,0.98,7.11,3.92,3.19,0,1.23,0.98,11.03,0,1.72,0.25,3.43,12.5,3.43,1.23,1.47,3.92,1.72,1.72,2.7,0,0.25,2.45,5.15,1.96,0.25,1.72,0.49,8.58,3.68,0,2.7,1.47,0.98,8.33,10.78,1.47,13.24,1.47,5.39,6.37,0.49,0.98,0.49,0.49,0,0.25,1.72,0.98,0.49,0,0.25,0,15.44,8.58,1.23,0,0,0.74,0,0.98,0.98,2.7,0,0.25
b6ah7e,I can hear my neighbors' verbal and physical abuse. What should I do?,"I live in an apartment building in Queens, NY where everyone can hear what’s going on in the apartments next to each other clear as day. The neighbors next door, an older couple in their 50s, are in a constant screaming battle with each other. I don’t know much about them other than that they got recently married within the last 5-6 years.

Every night the husband is a mad man. He screams and screams and all she does is try to calm him down, and then she’s eventually in hysterics. This can go on for days. Yesterday they were arguing from 8am through 6am the next morning.

Some common phrases from the husband: 

“Would you just shut up and listen to me”

“Just leave me alone”

“I can’t stand this anymore”

&amp;#x200B;

Wife: 

“I’m trying to help you” 

“We were getting along so well and now we’re fighting again” 

“I didn’t do anything”

&amp;#x200B;

It’s a constant loop of the same angry phrases, all being screamed at each other.

When I first moved in to my apartment in 2016 I was very concerned hearing this every night. I texted my super and he said “they are probably fine, they love each other.” I called the police and they knew the address right away and never showed up. I assume they get called often on them.

Now almost 3 years later and all I ever hear is banging and the wife exclaiming “stop hitting me, why are you doing this to me?” And the husband saying “I don’t even care anymore.”

I’m scared to get involved because the husband is so viscous, but I’m afraid one of them is going to kill the other one day.

b6c4bn,My abuser has died,"There is history here that I would like to one day explain but for now, know that my father was an abusive alcoholic who tortured my family and myself.
He died. Just like I wanted him to. Sad, alone, unloved and not found for several days because no one cared to look for him. I feel guilty that I wished this on him.
But more than that I am angry that even in death he is torturing my family and forcing us to deal with his death as his next of kin. Financially we can't afford to deal with his body. But more than that, emotionally I can't deal with this.
We cut him out of our lives almost 5 years ago. He reared his head regularly to try and get us back under his thumb but we resisted. Now I have to take charge of my family and give him a death any human being deserves as a basic courtesy. The problem is I'm struggling to believe that he deserves that.
I'm also struggling not to feel relief. Relief that he won't hurt my family anymore. Relief that I can sleep without worrying he will come to our homes in the middle of the night. Relief that I don't have to look over my shoulder for him while in public.
I hate that I was healing and that now I have been dragged back down again with his death. I hate that as the middle sibling I have to be the rock for my mother and my siblings. I had that he forced this on me.

b6g50m,Growing up abused,"I turned 18 a bit over a month ago. I told myself for years once I turned 18 I would completely separate myself from my family. My mother always told me she “owned” me until I was 18. But there are a list of things that have made it hard and pushed it passed that date. I moved out, well was kicked out last July when I was 17. Which I will get to later. There’s always some anxiety keeping me in contact with my family , such as the stuff still in my mother’s home I haven’t been able to get back yet, or my cat still in her house. My birth certificate and medical records she keeps locked in a box. The one thing that frequently comes to mind is my mental health record she likes to pass around to people as if it was a yearbook to sign. There is nothing unusual wrong with me other than depression, anxiety and ptsd from years of abuse at her hands. It’s not like my records say I’m homicidal or something. In big bold letters it lists off Depression, Anxiety, Sexual Abuse, and lastly PTSD. She passes it around as if to gain sympathy from people for her “raising such a troublesome child”. As if she didn’t cause the problems in the first place. All of my medical records show notes from doctors and physical and emotional evidence from sexual abuse. What young child gets UTI, after UTI for no reason? What young child’s teacher calls the parent to inform them they suspect sexual abuse. Why would a therapist lie and say I have the clear signs and symptoms? Every single time he could get me alone, he would. Everyday in the summer when school would be out and my mom couldn’t watch me, every holiday, every family birthday party. I remember the first time it happened, I think I was 4 or 5, in my favorite princess dress. He looked at me and asked if I wanted to play a game, a new game. I think I was 7 when my aunt walked into the bathroom when he was in there with me. She saw everything and just said “oh”. Closed the door and walked away. He went out too. I sat in the bathroom by myself for a long time, wondering what was about to happen. I was so scared but excited because I thought this meant it must be the end of this. He was going to get in trouble and I wouldn’t have to come over here anymore, even if mom was busy. But after waiting a long time I opened the bathroom door, walked into the kitchen. They both looked at me and said nothing. I didn’t understand, I thought maybe I’d get yelled at, if she wasn’t going to help me. But nothing was said . Whenever I tried to speak of it, it was quickly shoved away. Not just by my mother but by every family member. I was called a liar, shunned for speaking of it and forced to act normal at family functions when he would run up to me, pick me up in his arms and kiss me on the forehead. Throw me around like a rag doll in front of everyone, only because he knew he was untouchable. I’m not sure why he was always put before me, maybe because he was smarter than me? Maybe because he never made a fuss of things. Which is what I’d done. Or maybe he was just more like able than me? I always felt dumb and awkward around everyone, I’d get excited about something and be ignored, I swear I tried so hard to be liked, I’d be extra nice, extra cheerful , id wear things I thought my mother would like but no matter what it seemed I was just a bother, a burden. I felt just awkward. I’m really not sure. In elementary and middle school every time I was late or missed school, the office people would be so mean to me. Even make me cry. They acted like I could help that I was late , as if I was the one who drove myself. In 4th grade I missed over 40 days of school. A mixture of being sick from not eating, my mother refusing to get out of bed, and other at home problems. I don’t remember specific details but there was always something weird going on. Now that I’m older I understand things I didn’t back then. Like the bottle of pills my mother kept in her purse at all times with a smiley face drawn on the lid. Some days I’d wake up for school and go to my mothers room spend 20 minutes shaking her trying to wake her and she just wouldn’t wake up. She’d groan, or scream at me, but other days she’d be silent. Eventually I knew just to leave her alone, if she was doing that it meant I was going to school that day. And that was fine with me, I didn’t particularly like school anyway. I knew how to cook by 2nd grade. I’d make myself all my meals and if mom would be awake or willing to eat I’d always make us dinner. But sometimes there wasn’t any good in the fridge, I got used to this. My aunt wrote her phone number down and stuck it to the fridge with a magnet. She told me to call every time we didn’t have food, even if mom told me not to. Even though we barely ever had food, I think I only called a handful of times. I didn’t want to call, mainly because of embarrassment but I also feel guilty. I always felt guilty growing up about everything, no matter where I was. It didn’t matter if it was someone buying me a birthday present or something as stupid as asking for a glass of water. I felt as if I didn’t deserve anything. I still do most of the time. It was embarrassing whenever anyone would come to our house because it was always messy and cluttered. Mom would usually be in bed and If I knew someone was coming over I’d rush around to try and clean up. Even though I wasn’t even 10 years old if a family member came to the house and it was dirty they’d scream at me for not taking better care of the house and not helping my mother. Even though every single day I’d wake myself up for school, make my own lunch, try to either take the bus or walk, go to school all day, walk home. Come home to mom still being passed out, take care of all of the pets, do my homework, make dinner, take a shower and tuck myself in. But those were the better days, the bad ones would be the ones my mom was awake. I never knew what she’d be like, somedays she’d be so nice but anything could set her off in 5 seconds and she’d go crazy, other days she wouldn’t be nice at all. Even if there was no valid reason to be angry my mom would find one. I was always blamed for everything. In 5th grade mom officially lost her at home job, she was suicidal or tried to kill herself I’m really not sure which. I just know that my aunts showed up at the house one day and mom packed her bags, she was laughing the whole time as if everything was okay and funny. They told me to pack one too. Mom got in a different car than me and I had to go stay with family in Louisville. They told me this could’ve been prevented if id helped my mom with laundry or done the dishes more. I didn’t understand why mom would want to kill herself because I didn’t do the dishes , but that’s exactly what they told me. I got to visit her once that time she was there, she bragged that men in the ward were asking her to marry them. She thought it was so funny. I left in tears and my sister told me everything would be okay even though I knew it wouldn’t be. In 6th grade we were always so poor, we never had money for anything. Not school supplies, or clothes, shoes, food. I remember one month my mom started picking up used cigarette buds from ashtrays outside of stores or on the streets, because she felt she couldn’t live without the nicotine. I thought it was gross, but I didn’t say anything. I knew not to. Even though my aunts always switched back from acting like they hated me to being nice, they took my school shopping for 6th and 7th grade. I even got name brand converse which was such a big deal. I didn’t care if they’d said awful things to me, I was so happy to have new shoes and a backpack full of beautiful school supplies. I finally got the pack of neon sharpies that I’d wanted forever. I think sometimes they felt bad for me, but other times they didn’t understand why my mother wouldn’t change for me. I know they wanted her to but blaming me was easier on them maybe. I’m not sure. Maybe it was how they coped. In middle school we moved a lot, our house went into foreclosure multiple times. I was in and out of schools. One only being for two days. I didn’t mind these things, but it was the fact that Mom was always so mean to me during these times. When I was 12 I attempted suicide for the first time, my family called me a spoiled brat for not being grateful for what I had. Even though at this point it felt like I had nothing. As I got older my mom and I started arguing more and more. Mom always took her sleeping pills when she shouldn’t, she had what seemed like and endless supply of Vicodin and Ativan. I remember countless occasions where family members traded prescription pills for other ones. She was always mad at me, I could never do enough and if I had I hadn’t done it right. My mom truly acted as if she hated me, truly truly despised me. As if her life would be better if I wasn’t there. She’d beg people to let me move in with them, and they’d tell her no. She told me she loved her time away from me and she’d do anything to get more of it. I didn’t understand this. I never did anything to her, I always tried to be nice, I started trying to stay in my room more but this made her even madder. Suddenly I wasn’t spending enough time with her , I was a terrible daughter for never being home. Like I said I could never do anything right. The first time I was kicked out I was 15, she really hated me that year. I went to my dads for a couple of weeks before I went home, because somehow his house was just as worse as hers. All through high school my mother tried to sabotage anything and everything for me. She didn’t have my social security card so I couldn’t apply for my driving permit, and she always refused to get another one which kept me from getting my permit when I was 16, I couldn’t get it until I moved out at 17 which has set me back on being able to do a lot of things. She’s purposefully make me late to school, and work. She would walk around the house naked when my friends would come over, she’d say inappropriate things to them and flirt with them. She’d drink while my friends were over and eventually no one wanted to come over. She’d tell me they weren’t real friends anyway. When I was 17 she kicked me out because her current boyfriend wanted her to. At one point he asked her to have me forced into a residential facility so she wouldn’t be legally responsible for me and couldn’t get in trouble for moving away without me. My mother called my CPS worker but she refused, saying this wasn’t appropriate. My mother then asked the CPS worker if she’d get in trouble for “just leaving me on the streets” my mom got frustrated when she learned she could and would so she signed away custody to me to my father. My father didn’t take care of my because of this though. I didn’t even have a bed at his house, he didn’t have a couch either. If I was at his house I was expected to literally sleep on the floor. I still have neck and back problems because of this. I ended up staying with whoever I could after that, I ended up staying with one of my ex stepmoms for a bit, then a coworker. I spent a few nights a week with my boyfriend but his roommate didn’t want me staying there so a lot of nights i was trying to find somewhere to go even as late as 10pm. I had strangers offering to buy me a hotel room but I didn’t want charity from anyone. My family had all blocked my number at this point, as well as my mom. She hadn’t talked to me in 2 weeks. I went to my moms house with her best friend and her daughter to talk to her and she wasn’t there, we knocked on the front storm door and the plexi glass fell through. It was not shattered but the little knobs holding it in place had broke. The bottom of the window was still attached but at the very bottom the window was falling through.. I started crying and panicking knowing I’d get in trouble for this even though it was an accident. My family members started unblocking me and all calling me saying they were calling the police and if I ever called any of them or went to any of their houses I’d be arrested. I cried and cried and cried. I had no where to go. Nothing to my name, I think I had less than $100 at this point because I had a terrible job, and no one was taking care of me. I was completely paying for myself to eat and taxis because I had no car. My mom sent out a mass text message to my dad, aunts, ex stepmom, and a few friends and said she’d filed a police report and I needed to turn myself in. She called me a terrible
Person in this text message and completely humiliated me. Making everyone believe I was a drug addict, and a thief. She told the police I had broken into our house and stole her hydrocodones. Which I didn’t. If anyone knows me they know I don’t do drugs, drink or smoke because I know what it does to people obviously. Why she had hydrocodones in the house in the first place I’m sure you can understand at this point. My dad screamed at me for an hour before taking me back to his house. I cried and waited for the police to come get me for something I hadn’t done. They never showed up. They never did, I’m sure they realized what was going on and didn’t want to waste their time. But my cps worker did show up that day and said my mom had been harassing her about taking me away. At this point I hadn’t seen or talked to my mom in WEEKS. She had my number blocked still. My mom didn’t talk to me again until I was in the CPS office. My cps worker had picked me up from a house I was staying at and took me there for an interview. They needed parental consent and my dad wouldn’t answer the phone even though they tried calling. She said she was going to try calling my mom, I said my mom didn’t care and wouldn’t answer. But she did. She gave them consent then asked to speak to me. I was so confused, I hadn’t spoken to her in weeks and I had been told if I ever tried to contact her again she was going to press harassment charges against me and a restraining order. I answered the phone and said “Hello?” She said “HI BABY!!” Really loudly.. I was confused but I knew what she was doing. It was the thing she does after she’s gone through a phase, she’ll randomly be nice again but it never lasts. Turns out while I was homeless trying to find a place to sleep , she’d gone on vacation to the beach. Yeah, to the beach. I was hurt and confused and that was the moment I think I lost all respect for my mother. I know a lot of people don’t understand why it hadn’t been sooner but my whole life I tried to give my mom the benefit of the doubt. I loved my mom, no matter what. But at this point she was purposefully trying to hurt me and we both knew it. I think she knew she’d gone too far this time, I would always come back to her no matter what but I think she was actually scared this time. After my dad had hit me a few more times she finally let me come home and she was nice to me. She was trying but she knew that it was over. I didn’t trust her at all. I spent 5 nights a week at my boyfriends house until I moved in, in November. I never talked to her. I distanced myself as much as possible. On Christmas she begged me to come over and I did. She cried and said she missed me so much. I missed her too but all she’s ever done is tricked me and hurt me. She’ll gain my trust to use things I’ve told her in secret against me. She’s taken money I’ve earned from my jobs since I was 15, she’s kicked me out. Ignored my abuse. Called me a liar. Filed a false police report against me( yes it has been dropped). Put me in a house with my dad knowing he abused me. Let me be sexually abused for years. Hit me. Locked me in rooms. Not provided me with basic food, clothes, sometimes she wouldn’t even bother to pay the water or electric bills and they’d be shut off all the time. I’m not trying to sound like a brat, I’m not trying to get attention or anything but people don’t understand why I don’t have a family. This is why. I’m sure there’s a million things I forgot to put in here but there’s way too many things that happened over the years.",Phantomhourglass12,2019-03-28 01:14:59,0,3185,20.54,24.58,85.02,10.64,15.77,10.93,94.66,61,22.42,17.52,11.65,0.35,0.03,4.43,1.07,4.87,4.14,13.34,10.61,5.71,7.85,3.36,21.66,4.36,2.29,1.54,1.35,1.85,5.18,1.98,3.17,0.57,1,0.69,12.97,2.32,0.41,5.34,1.07,15.64,2.39,1.63,2.73,3.39,2.76,5.18,1.92,0.35,1.04,0.53,2.01,0.57,0.63,0.16,0.75,6.75,1.76,1.35,1.98,1.57,0.53,10.89,6.59,0.6,15.16,2.57,6.72,6.28,1.7,0.88,1.98,0.53,0.03,0.13,0.38,0.03,0,0.13,0.09,0.06,14.03,6.19,3.42,0,0,0.16,0.06,0,0.38,3.74,0.06,0.03
b6g7ta,I’m being abused emotionally and physically by my girlfriend,"I suffer from severe depression, mental and physical anxiety, and severe anger issues. I have to take 20mg of Prozac every day, and riboflavin for intense migraines I get on a daily basis. My father was abusive to me as a child and it left me with sever emotional scarring, to the point where I am a sociopath and I like to hurt others. The one person I don’t like hurting is my girlfriend. The only issue is, she physically and verbally abuses me every time we argue. Every time we fight, I always end up getting slapped, bitten, punched, kicked, my hair ripped out, or hit in my genitals. She thinks that this is ok, and since I can’t control myself I fight back physically, I know this is not ok, but I feel like she would kill me one day and I couldn’t do anything about it by just letting it happen. She has told me time and time again that I am a failure, that she hates me, that no one loves me, that I am disgusting, she insults my physical appearance, she is overall horrible to me. She takes every chance she gets to start fights with me, and I can’t take it anymore. I have attempted to take my own life 10+ times, and I recently lost my best friend to suicide. When I spoke at his funeral, I went to my friends house afterwards, and she kept spam calling me, insulting, saying she hated me, and getting angry at me because I was with my friends. My friends and I were all best friends with him, and it makes me happy to be around them because I miss my buddy, and they’re all I have left. Last years summer, i tried to drink myself to death after my girlfriend said she would never love me, that she hates me, I’m worthless, no one will ever love me, and I should die. She then took care of me out of guilt, and since that day has stopped loving me like she used to. I can’t do this anymore, but she won’t let me leave her. I fear that if I stay with her, I will keep physically abusing her, because she makes it seem ok when she does it everyday. I don’t know what I should do, especially since we are going to college together in August. I’m so scared for my life, and she fails to realize my mental issues and my mental health.

b6jg5d,Helpful tips for the boyfriend of a child abuse survivor.,"Hey there, 
my girlfriend is a victim of sexual child abuse. 
She is currently in a small clinic that specializes on trauma therapy. She said to me that she has panic attacks and dissoziation on a daily basis there. Is that a bad sign?  

I am also very afraid of doing something wrong when she comes back. Like triggering her and causing flashbacks. Because i am almost sure i have caused some in the past. Have you got any tips for me on how i should treat her? I know i can ask her some stuff, but i don't want her to feel uncomfortable because of my questions. Or i don't want to invade her personal space because i am so worried. She has a real issue with saying no when someone makes her feel uncomfortable. Or should i just trust, that she can say that when she comes back after 8 weeks? 

And if you have general tips for a significant other of a victim of abuse feel free to comment them aswell. I will take all the help i can get :D",basuperstar21,2019-03-28 07:27:28,4,194,22.68,67.85,11.9,1,12.93,12.89,93.3,60.31,21.13,16.49,8.25,0,1.03,6.7,0.52,4.64,5.67,10.82,10.31,6.7,8.25,1.55,17.01,5.15,1.03,2.06,0.52,2.06,10.31,2.58,7.22,2.58,2.06,0,15.98,0,1.03,6.7,0.52,15.98,2.58,4.64,2.58,5.15,1.03,2.58,3.09,0,1.55,1.55,1.55,0,1.03,0.52,0,9.28,2.06,0.52,4.12,1.55,1.55,1.55,16.49,0.52,9.79,1.03,4.64,5.15,0,0,0,0.52,0,0,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,10.31,5.67,1.55,0.52,0,1.55,0,0,0,1.03,0,0
b6jid7,How can i tell if my parents are abusive??,"I don't want to tell my whole life story, but let's just say that I have some pretty gruesome times with my family but have gotten over.. Mostly when I was a kid, my brother who's my age used to fight with each other at age 12-14 or 15. It started off like any other siblings, arguing, fussing at each other, blaming them for stuff. Then idk why or how, but it got physical. I'd start fights and it'd be like abusive fights.. I started fights for months. Then I got super tired of it because my brother is stronger than me. Then he'd initiate fights.. It was bad. He'd throw my stuff I cared about off my two story window, hit me, punch me, kick me hard, yank my hair and drag me with my hair, he'd hit me and throw stuff at me. locked me outside, threaten to kill me, stabbed me with a ink pen, and i took my sock off and the blood from that soaked up the blood and had to throw the entire sock away.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to hit, punch, kick, yell and scream at him like he did to me, I had fingernails though, so he'd hit me and i'd scratch him to get out of it and to go hide and cry by myself.

&amp;#x200B;

So all that happened.. My parents would tell us to stop sometimes, and punish us more for it. Then, after awhile since i initiated it for awhile and stopped, my mom didn't defend me from then on.. She'd always ask what i did to start. and (or) deserve it. 

That was very painful for me because she wasn't there for me..

&amp;#x200B;

No body knew it, but I was being sexually abused when all this fighting broke out.. I knew i couldn't say anything.

On a side note: My dad tells me to shut up or to shut my mouth if he says something disrespectful to me or my brothers, I can't defend myself. He doesn't want to hear anyone's side but his. He acts so mad and disgusted at me and my brothers everyday too.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom on the other hand.. She is another story.. She goes around acting like me and my brother who's my age are the laziest kids on the planet.. we're both 18 now mind you.. We both work full time, I'm an athlete, so I have to train a lot everyday or every other day.. If we don't get out chores done, she'll go on a huge tyrant about how we don't respect her, and don't listen to her wishes... It's kinda hard to do that when me and my brother are working full time, and are trying to have lives of our own.. I haven't seen her do chores in years, plus she isn't showing the two younger brothers how to do chores..

Plus when me and my brother get chores done she says something sarcastic like ""Oh it's about time you got this done, don't expect me to tell you that you did a great job after not doing it for days"" Which i kinda see her point, but she doesn't have to say that.

&amp;#x200B;

If i tell my mom as simple as this she'll get mad and go off; I told her that by her going to public school, and when she graduated, she might have seen other kids in her grade so they're not complete strangers to her when she graduates. I'm homeschooled, so going into it I assumed that i didn't know these kids(but i did, and that's not the point of this) the point is when i said that she went on a HUGE TYRANT saying that I didn't know what she went through, you can't assume about her when I know nothing, I don't know how she felt or how alone she felt... Basically she was saying that  assumed about her, which is true, but not like that.. then she went on to feel sorry for herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I said to my mom yesterday that she looks like she's mad at stuff all the time, and she went tf off.. Her face was looking mad.. I noticed it, so what?She shuts me down when she accuses and assumes stuff about me, she gets to ALWAYS have her say, I mean ALWAYS. but she shuts me down and acts like i'm the biggest pain to defend myself.

&amp;#x200B;

She tells me on the daily how I don't do anything.. I do some chores and i workout. Most days, I do self- care stuff and babysit my brothers when they get home,,  I don't like how she always has to be right, always state her opinion first and if I disagree then I'm either ungrateful, hateful (for defending myself to her) or this disrespectful ugly child. 

I'm starting to wear again and become depressed.. it's hard to live 24/7 in this.. I'm saving up for a car and saving up to move out. but it's hard to always deal with..

b6k8qj,My mother the manipulator,"My older sister, who I will be calling Pam, and I have been forcibly homeschooled our entire lives. I didn't start to attend extracurricular on a regular basis until I was about 8, and by then, I was already suffering from the effects of social anxiety. When we were little kids, I noticed that my mom showed immense favoritism towards me instead of Pam. I would definitely describe her as abusive towards Pam, who was nearly diagnosed with opposition defiance disorder. Pam has even confessed to me that one time, in the middle of the night, she was too afraid to go to the bathroom because she believed our mom would punish her severely if she did. She ended up wetting the floor, and of course, my mom was very quick to blame her for this.

&amp;#x200B;

As we grew older, and my sister outgrew her rebellious habits, my mom expressed to both of us that she believed Pam was demon possessed as a little girl. The fact that she used this to justify her abhorrent parenting methods makes me sick to my stomach.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to middle school, when I was 13 and my sister was 15, her favoritism switched over to Pam. It was around this time that we downsized substantially, and the three of us moved into a two bedroom townhome. Ever since my early childhood, my mom and dad fought constantly, and my dad's always been nothing more than a background character in my life. It was at this point that he decided to move out, and we rarely spoke after that. For the sake of time, I won't go into the nitty-gritty details, but this quickly became one of the most stressful periods of our lives for several reasons. Miraculously, I was able to befriend some kids who lived in my cul-de-sac, and for the first time ever my mom actually let me go outside and play with them. Sadly, this wouldn't last for very long.

&amp;#x200B;

The longer we stayed in the townhome, the worse my mother's state of mind became. Whenever she was angry or just having a bad day, she would often take it out on me through verbal abuse. By this time, I was starting to form my own beliefs and fashion preferences, and my true personality was starting to emerge. My mom always envisioned me as being exactly like her, so when she saw our very obvious differences, she didn't like it a bit. Eventually, she came up with every excuse possible to keep me from seeing or speaking to my friends on the cul-de-sac. I remember watching from my bedroom window as my friends stood outside our patio, ringing our doorbell. I'll never forget the look of disappointment on their faces when my mom told them that I wasn't allowed to play with them anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

From this point forward, I was only allowed to socialize once a week for my drama class, and that was it. For about a year, I was left alone in isolation with nothing but the internet, and my thoughts. I was taking my academics online, but I had become so incredibly depressed, that I didn't see any reason to complete my assignments. I sat in my bed doing absolutely nothing, until I was several months behind in school. When my mom found out, I confessed to her how I was feeling, and that I had been cutting myself for months. I am not at all saying that I shouldn't have been disciplined for this. I will always be the first to admit that I was edgy as fuck, and I wasn't the easiest kid to raise, but the punishments that she inflicted upon me were absolutely sadistic, best suited for someone who skins cats for fun.

&amp;#x200B;

I genuinely believe that she relished in my psychological torture. It was as if she finally had the power that she never had as a kid (she was also abused by her mom, probably more so than me). There are large portions of my memory that have been blocked out, but I remember her pinning me down to my bed by the throat, striking me across the face, violently throwing objects down the stairs, pulling my hair, and the list continues. Whenever she felt that I was misbehaving, she would call my dad on the phone and make him come over to back her up. She would bring him in a separate room where we couldn't defend ourselves, and by the time he emerged, he was instantly turned against us.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my most upsetting memories is of being pinned down on my back with my mom on top of me, shrieking and spitting in my face. If I ever looked to my dad for help, I would be met with emotionless eyes. Sometimes, I would have to take breaks in between to run to the nearest bathroom so I could vomit. During one such instance, my dad accused me of faking it, and called it attention seeking behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

Her torture sessions continued until I agreed to ""conform"" to her beliefs. Since then, I've done everything I can to stifle my emotions and personal values. At this point, if lying my way through college is the only way I can escape, then I'll lie my little heart out. I think she likes me now, which is nice. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom's always believed that as long as no marks or evidence is left behind, then it doesn't count as abuse. That's how she's able to sleep at night without feeling a speck of remorse.

b6m8mm,My ex posted something about me on here,"And I found it. 

I'm an abuse survivor since 2012. Or since childhood, if you consider the abuse my sisters put me through as a child. Most of my romantic relationships have been toxic or abusive in some way, with only a few exceptions. 

My ex came on here and made some long post about everything I put him through, and how my inability to cope affected him. He did shed some light on how I had some toxic behaviors and hurt him in ways I didn't realize, especially in terms of substance abuse, but he called me an alcoholic (not true) and frequent drug user (also not true, not even remotely). He also said a bunch of other things that were untrue, but whether they were misremembered, misinterpreted, or intentionally falsified is anybody's guess at this point. 

What I'm most upset about is that he genuinely thinks what I've done to him these last couple months was abusive. In reality, I needed space to clear my head. I asked for it, he agreed to give it to me, and then he didn't. He continued messaging me and reaching out to the point of harassment. The first time I heard him call me abusive was after a long day of frequent messaging (which I ignored), followed by a series of phone calls at 2 in the morning, all of which went unanswered until the 5th call in a row, when I finally answered, said ""I am trying to sleep,"" and immediately hung up. The result was another slew of messages, accusing me of being ""abusive and evil."" 

What I did there was not abusive, it was self-preservation. 

This guy cyberstalked me for at least 2 months after I ended the relationship and moved 1500 miles away, and I have reason to believe he's been reading my Facebook messages as well. On top of all this, he's recently been reaching out to people I'm close with, some of whom he's never even met, and feeding them the same lies. I guess he's claiming he's just ""trying to set the record straight"" or something, I don't know, but he's told them that I'm a liar and anything I've said about him was probably a lie. I don't even talk about him though, the guy is just delusional. 

Reading what he wrote about me, like I said, was sobering in moments. He did call me out on some toxic behaviors that were legitimate, that I do realize I am guilty of, and that I want to take responsibility and accountability for and try to change. But most of it was just lies, and seeing people rally around him and defend him like that is... a complicated thing to process. 

I don't even know how to feel about all of it. Sort of everything all at once, and then just numb. And the cycle repeats, like it always does. And I don't know what to do.",foreverneveryours,2019-03-28 11:14:31,3,501,27.93,42.86,72.29,2.62,18.56,15.37,92.81,61.28,21.76,14.57,8.98,0,0.2,4.79,0.6,7.19,4.39,15.37,9.78,6.59,8.58,2.2,18.96,4.39,2.79,2.59,1.2,3.79,4.59,1,3.59,0.4,2.4,0.2,12.97,0.2,0.4,0.2,5.19,15.37,2.79,2.2,0.6,4.99,2.4,3.79,2.2,0.6,1.2,0.4,1.6,0.4,1,0,0.4,3.99,2,1.2,0.6,0.2,0.2,8.38,8.58,0.4,14.37,1.8,6.59,5.79,0.4,0.4,0,0.2,0,0,0.6,0,0,0,0.2,0,18.56,5.59,6.59,0,0,0,0,0.2,1.2,3.79,1.2,0

b6r1rc,Is this considered abuse??,"i’ve had this small conflicting thing in my head for a while but had nowhere to go to talk about it other than two of my closest friends. i’ve been hit (not incredibly hard, just a small whack against the head) and yelled at by my mom before. idk if it’s considered abuse or not but i’m curious to know.

Recently (as in an hour ago) my mom and i got back from a band meeting for Disney. Certain kids at the meeting got money back from all the fundraising they’ve done. They can either give the kids the money to spend at disney or return it back to the parents. I had my mom go up n ask how much and that i wanted to keep it. She came back, got really close and told me how much, which idk why she got really close I didn’t entirely like it so i asked why she was. She got snappy at me and whacked me with a fucking folder in front of my friends. I then blurted out, on accident, “you piece of shit” and she got really pissed. Don’t blame her for getting mad, my fault for cussing at her, but I just didn’t understand why she got so close to me. She was doing it jokingly but I still didn’t really like it. I also don’t really give a shit on what my friends think of my parents but the fact that she whacked me really pissed me off.

My mom is an incredibly sweet person if you meet her, but she has really bad anxiety and can get extremely verbal when it comes to being in anxious situations. She’s screamed and like I said, whacked, because of me doing something wrong or just whatever. Some of the things she’s said have engraved in my head and it doesn’t always settle well.

I brought this up with my boyfriend and he told me to mention/bring it up to her. I definitely will, at some point, but I’m really anxious about what her reaction is gonna be. Her reaction all depends on her mood, as is everyone else’s, but hers can be very extreme and it concerns me.

b6yy4p,My brother is aggressive and controlling,"I'm sorry if this post doesn't belong here. Sorry it's a long read, it could be longer but I didn't want to ramble on. I'm just fed up living around the negativity he passes out. 

I'm 24, I live at home with my mum and my brother (27). I would move if I was in the place to.

My brother has always been a bit controlling and manipulative. When I was 13/14 he used to tell that I'm not allowed to have a boyfriend and that I wasn't ever allowed to have sex, he would do this to the point where it would stress me out. He would get angry if he heard someone liked me. Could be passed off as a protective brother but it was just really weird and comfortable. When I was 16, me and his bandmate took interest in one another. My brother threatened his bandmate to stay away from me, while he was gloating about it one evening he said on along the lines of ""the amount of guys I've had to tell to stay away from you. I should knock your face around a little bit, mess it up a little, give you a broken nose"" he said it in a slight joking tone but there was some seriousness behind it. I felt his presence because it was fucked up. He later came to the ""realisation"" that he stepped over the line and was very sorry. 

He would make me feel like shit throughout my teens, calling me all the names under the sun if I didn't let him use my laptop - he was using it to watch porn. Acted me like having a laptop shown I was the favourite, him forgetting the fact he had PlayStation and gaming consoles. 

I had a lock put on my door because he would stand in my doorway at night, watching me. I don't know what he was doing, I had my back to him pretending to sleep, it was creepy.

At age 21, he aggression peaked. On his 21st birthday, he got drunk and attacked my mum. He screamed in her face, had her on the floor while she was holding a puppy, and bit my mum's head like some zombie. The police was called and he was sent to my grandparents. My mum brought him home the next day. Which she shouldn't have. After that the barriers were down and he had outbursts happened almost every week, screaming in her face and punching walls and doors. 

He sits around pouting and glaring, giving himself a pity party over the most trivial things, he still starts arguments and acts all innocent. 

If him and my mum have an argument he'll say stuff like ""why don't you ever have a go at Chicken"". Then passes that aggression onto me because I rarely argue with mum, saying ""I get off easy"". Nearly every time.

He says I'm to blame for any problem in the house. The internet having a sucky connection day? That's my fault. YouTube being a butt? That's my fault. He said him and his male witch friend agreed that I subconsciously affect things in the house. That I have mind control that I'm not in control of. It's just crazy bullshit to make me feel bad and to blame for shit. 

I'm 24 and he acts like he has a right to dictate how I spend my life. Telling me what should I time get up. I go to work and college yet he'll still treat me like I'm sat at the house all day.

He was calling my nan an idiot, stupid and fucking moron with no hope because she didn't do exactly as he said. He gave her money for fence panels and told her which to buy and she ""undermined"" him by looking for cheaper ones. This was only a few days ago. He started bitching and moaning about me, getting himself all worked up because I stayed in the front room to look at cars on the computer while him and girlfriend slept on the sofa.

My family kind of let's him get away with everything he does, and I'm sick of it.",ChickenInDaRoom,2019-03-29 08:51:54,3,708,33.34,57.84,24.23,1,15.39,12.57,93.5,60.59,22.88,17.8,9.18,0.14,0.56,7.91,0,5.08,5.93,13.14,10.73,3.81,6.92,1.69,20.48,3.53,1.84,1.27,1.27,2.26,7.06,1.69,5.37,0.28,2.82,0.56,15.54,1.84,0.56,2.26,8.19,10.45,0.71,2.82,2.68,1.98,1.69,2.12,2.54,0.56,1.41,0.42,2.82,1.41,0.56,0.56,0.28,7.06,1.69,0.28,3.39,0.99,0.85,7.77,8.9,0.56,15.4,1.98,9.18,4.66,1.13,0.99,1.55,0.56,0,0.14,1.27,1.27,0,0,0,0,15.25,6.07,3.25,0,0,0.28,0,0.14,1.41,3.67,0.28,0.14

b71yxu,Should I cut contact with my family?,"I'm not really sure where to begin as the title implies, but I'll try my best.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, my name is well, let's just go with Jake for privacy reasons, as you can already tell by the title, I have some family issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try my best to explain myself, my situation and my family for context.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 26 years old, moved out, on my own, I have always had rocky relationships with both my mother and father, and even some of my other family, cousins, aunts, ect ect.

&amp;#x200B;

This all started when I was little, my mother and father were not the best of parents, I'll start with my father. He was abusive growing up, both mentally and physically. He was one of those parents that liked to brag about their child's success to other parents, and upon finding out other parents had kids that were more, academically successful then I, he would make sure to tell me, call me useless, worthless, and would never stop comparing me to other kids my whole life, even up until the day I moved out.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, sometimes words would not cut it. Iv been beaten my father a lot when I was little, as early as age 7 or 8. Iv been punched in the face, stomach, thrown to the ground you name it multiple times due to my lack of academic success or just being in the middle of one of his rages he would take out on me.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother, was also abusive but not nearly to the extent of my father. For the record, my parents would fight a lot, and I mean, a lot. Mostly mental but there have been a decent amount of times where my father would hit my mother pretty bad and as someone who was only a kid at the time, my only thought was to just, keep quiet. She would also witness a lot of my physical abuse by my father but would stay quiet, and outright deny that it happened to both me and her and when I tried to talk about it she would get upset and change topics.

&amp;#x200B;

By the time I turned 16, I had grown a lot, I understood by that age it was abuse. I remember the first time I stood up to my father, he was upset, in one of his rages, and he socked me right in the face, I ended up throwing a punch back that knocked him to the ground, since that day, hes never tried to attack me again.

&amp;#x200B;

My family was also very religious, (despite me never being religious), I was forced to go the church, join a religious after school program for years, all that stuff, despite telling my parents numerous times I was not religious, of course, I stopped reminding them that, because everytime I told them It mostly lead to more abuse, and I was pretty much forced to partake in a lot of this crap, until the day I moved out.

&amp;#x200B;

There was also a lot of trust issues in my family, if I said anything to both my mother or father in private, they would just blurt it out to other people, co-workers, family ect, despite how ""private"" the conversation was.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, that's just some of the abuse that has happened in the past and a few like verbal abuse is still on-going through the few calls I have with them every now and then. Iv been thinking a lot about my past lately and if cutting contact with my family might be an option. As you can probably tell, I'm not close to my family, never have been prolly never will, and I'm currently debating if cutting contact with them for good might be a good thing for my overall mental health and to help me move on from my past.",JakeRod555,2019-03-29 13:02:51,1,675,42.61,38.33,81.46,17.2,30.68,11.41,91.56,57.93,18.52,14.07,10.67,0.15,0.44,1.93,0.89,4.44,5.19,14.37,9.19,6.52,7.26,1.63,15.56,4.3,2.22,1.04,1.19,3.85,5.33,2.37,2.96,0.3,1.93,0.3,12.59,4.59,0.44,1.33,2.81,13.93,1.19,1.48,2.22,5.04,1.78,3.7,0.44,0,0.44,0,1.63,0.59,1.04,0,0,8.74,3.41,1.93,2.96,1.48,0.74,7.11,6.37,1.33,14.96,2.07,5.78,7.41,1.48,1.48,1.33,0,0.74,0,0.59,0.15,0.15,0,0.15,0.15,20.44,3.11,9.04,0,2.96,0.15,0,0.3,0.3,1.33,0.3,2.96

b73kvr,Im not sure if this is even considered abuse.,"My ex boyfriend used the fact that I loved him, to control me, so to speak. I'm not sure if this could even be considered abuse, quite frankly, but because of the him, being in relationships can be very hard for me.
He broke up with me, but we still saw talked and hung out as friends (he was a childhood friend before we started dating). He knew that I still loved him but he made it clear that he didn't want to continue dating and that he was moving onto other people, yet once in a while he would make a move on me and start touching and kissing me, sometimes even asking for sex. It was hard to say no and turn away because I still had so many feelings for him. When I did conjure up the guts to say that this wasn't right, he would apologise. But the next time I saw him, he would do it again. Sometimes I would even cry because I knew exactly what he was doing. He was using me, and by not getting as far away from him as possible, I was letting him. Though he wasn't physically abusive, he always left bruises on my body from the way he handled me and I actually have a scar on my back from when he pushed me against the carpet and started making out with me. 
In my current relationship, I have a hard time trusting my boyfriend. When he says that he loves me, all I hear is ""I love to use you"". Sometimes when he touches a certain part of my body, I tense up. When he or one of my friends casually brings up sex, I become nauseous and upset.
I suspect this is all because of my ex.
I don't want to claim to be a victim of abuse. I have suffered nothing compared to others. But what he did to me hurt so bad. I am glad to say that after a year of this behavior, he is out of my life. I feel like I can finally breath, yet some nights are very hard for me. 
Would this be considered a form of abuse or am I just taking this more seriously than it really is?

b763q5,I am stuck...,"I don't know where to start this. But I feel like im slowly deteriorating away mentally. I don't know if I am being an ungreatful person, or someone who probably has it better. I am very confused, and very heart broken.

To give myself some info, You can call me Camo. I am in my 20s. I live with my parents and I pay for their utilities and whatever is needed around, as well as taking care of 2 younger kids (my siblings), I work as a freelancer, so I do get some work here and there but is frequent enough where I am usually pulling all nighters most of times, while I try to find a decent job at the same time. My parents for the for the most think I don't work at all, or do anything. I've been trying to tell my mother about the treatment my father gives me, but she doesn't do anything and pins the blame on me for setting him off.

To show you how my father is like: At times he can be extremely insightful and kind. Like a whole completely different person. Someone YOU actually would like to be around. He is very intelligent at what he does as well. But most of the times when something does not go his way, he insults you and threatens you like saying: ""If you dont shut the fuck up and do as I tell you, Ill punch your teeth right in!"" Its also a problem when he asks you to search up something for him and its something that doesnt align with what he wants, he insults you and doesnt believe you, even if you tell him thats the truth or correct defenitions. Ive been belittled by him way too many to count ever since I was 7. Like ""You cant do anything right!"", ""Youve done this before, why cant you do it again? Worthless."" ""Stupid, you did it all wrong."" The list goes on. He also has this weird thing to where, when we have visitors or other people, he becomes the most sociable thing. Also bragging about a lot of things. Acting charismatic, a whole other different person.
He has had a rough past, like losing his mother when he was 8 and enduring extreme abuse from his other family members. He has had a terrible childhood. I believe that this is the issue, the reason why he sees me, mother , and siblings as a threat, he's projecting his hate and abuse onto us.

As for my mother:
She is usually very mellow but at times kind of a sleeze? She sometimes listens and sometimes does not. Its always been like this for me when I was little, as much as I can remember. She always makes my emotions feel insignificant and invalid. Like , ""There is much worse out there, what I did to you is nothing"" kind of mentality. She isnt extreme as my dad, and I honestly think that my dad is holding her back. She doesnt like to be told that what she is doing could put her in trouble, like example from a while back: My two siblings (We will go with A and B) were fighting, my mother wasn't around, I had to calm them down, both were fighting over something small. I saw that B set off A and A was asking for B to stop. Only for B to be extremely rude about it. A became fed up. My mother came by and started to say cruel things to A because she thought she was mistreating B. I told her what really happened and she dismisses me like that. I told her ""Why wouldn't you believe me? I was there! I was settling both down, not you! You were not there! You didnt judge the situation appropriately!"" Then she tells me to shut up and that I am wrong. I kept telling her, ""This is not like you! This is why B is very rude to both of you and hits you! You were not there to see the whole thing. It is not like you!"" She immediately turns around and grabs a heavy soap box and with a burning hatred just throws it at me, hitting my shoulder and it bruised up.
She also dealt with a rough past, an abusive father and mother. She has 7 older brothers who were not abusive though. Though, she claims she has no ill will towards both parents. But most of it consists of how her mother would beat her for no reason. And sometimes place her hand on top of the burning stove top to get rid of her fear of getting burned. Her father, drunk, would beat her and her mother. Its to a point where I believe that the reason why her mother treated her different was perhaps that my mother was a ""rape baby"". She did mention that there were other men in her mothers life and she was most likely sexually abused by one of them. And my mother thinks that too. She also had to go through nearly getting abducted by sexual predators on the way to school (which its extremely scarring) and dealing with other women who would spread this rumour around of her, a 14 year old, going out with their crusty dusty old husbands. And my mother's mother would believe them and would beat her with a rod, where is to my mother kept denying everything and telling her that she would never do such a thing.

Around 2014, my mother was cheating online with some other dudes (not actually meeting them up, but pretty much sexting them though), she was fed up with my dad and how he belittled her. My father found out and started calling her extreme vile insults. Like something that was not like him to say. It was like this for 2 months I believe. My father was trying to make me pick sides during the situation, same with my mother. I kept telling them that I still loved them, I think its better if yall can maybe talk about it and perhaps set up for divorce. But my father kept bringing up ""If we separate, I will never come back, you will never hear me again"". Even mentions of suicide. On my mothers side, she would care less. She understood what I told her. It came to a point where, my father kept saying ""Youre just like your mom, the same!."" in the most negative and disgusted way. During that time, I was trying to get sibling B to come with me, but she was threatning me and everyone else with a knife, I just wanted the kids to not be around all of this, but she didnt let me take the youngest B with me. Later that time span, my father was verbally abusing my mother to the point she was on tears and begging him to stop. I stepped in and told him ""Quit it, you are not like that!"" He commanded me to put on a movie and to shut up. And I refused because he kept insulting her. He got up and pushed me extremely hard to the side to where I hurt my side into one of the tables. From here I don't know what came to me, but it felt like years of anger and sadness just burst, I lost it. I went up and fought back. He got up and started to punch me as well. He kept calling me ""So you think youre a man huh?! You lesbian!"" (Im not a lesbian, but most of the things I do is both equally feminine and masculine.) I felt a sense of control in those moments, but I went back to stop fighting because this isnt me, I wasnt like that. The adrenaline blocked all the pain. He kept bringing up his stupid Book God and saying that people like me will go to hell for laying a hand at my parents. He kept bringing up stupid bible verses as if it makes him in the right.


Another incident that happened months ago was that my father said something to my mother. He has this awful thing where he keeps picking at it and never ceases, as if he thrives in conflict or something. My mother got fed up with him and I dont remember much of the details  but it wound up to where my mother hit my dad with a gallon of hand sanitizer directly to his head. He was bleeding from his ear from the impact and got hand sanitizer directly in his eyes too. I also realized that he had small puncture wounds, my mother was trying to stab him while he was down. I honestly dont know what happened here because I wasnt around for the beginning, but when I was trying to settle the situation, she kept putting the blame on me out of nowhere. Sibling A was trying to settle her down, Sibling A told me that she looked like she was in a catatonic state, so try not to raise your voice or anything, she tells me. I had to tend my fathers wounds. It was to a point where he was sort of chuckling about it and being suspiciously mellow? I was angry at him. They don't realize, after all of that. They instilled extreme fear in all of us. To this day, I wake up in extreme fear. Like weird awful jumpy- hits in the gut.

 Just recently he ordered me to cook, and I told him, I am not sure what to cook, because we didnt have all the ingredients (and he was being vague on what he wanted). He started to yell at me and insult me saying, ""You cant do anything!"". I told him it was not needed for him to treat me that way, to not talk to me like that since I am doing what he is asking me to do. He thinks I was doing everything in a bad mood. I became quickly fed up and started to defend myself from the insults, for which it bothered him and started to threaten me with violence, ""I will punch your teeth right in, if you don't shut the fuck up!"" ""Ill beat the fuck out of you!"". He was yelling at me to get out of the kitchen. I told him I wasnt going anywhere because he is dealing with everything badly, to let me handle it. He grabs my forearm violently, his tight grip hurts me and throws me out with all his force. I yelled at him, ""What is wrong with you!? You are not like this!"" My adrenaline was getting the best of me, shaking and at the verge of crying because I know I cannot defend myself back. I did not want to relive that same situation back in 2014. Sibling B was there to see it all happen and he was scared. He was asking him to stop when my father was being awful.
Just a while ago he asked for forgiveness, where he NEVER does that. He usually sees me or anybody else, unworthy of forgiveness or to be asked for forgiveness. No matter how wrong, cruel or hurtful he was. I know I should feel greatful that he said sorry, but it felt scary and off.

I love my parents very much, I always gave up most of my friends invitations and other afterschool things so I can act as a babysitter for my siblings, yet I'm seen as a bother. I don't hate my parents. They have done good things for me as letting me stay, and basically care for me when I was a kid. I wanted to stay because I wanted to ease up all their weight, I wanted them to go out and enjoy what they couldnt have once in a while. Where is I could stay to care for my younger siblings. I dont think they see that from me. But I want to help them get better, I honestly think they have mental issues, but they deny it. I want to help them, because they arent like this internally. Im sure theyre acting on the past, heavily.

My current situation:
&gt;I dont have a place to stay, not even around my friends since some are going through worse/also same situation.

&gt;I dont have a liscense to drive. Though I know how to. But current two vehicles are of my parents, and they use it for their work.

&gt;I do have an ID.

&gt;I have a bank and paypal (thats where I do my freelancing)

b767v5,Is this abuse? He’s really nice to me and has never made a mean comment about me or acted controlling around me.,"He said I make him feel like the boss because he can mentor me in life cause I need help. Cause I listen to him and don’t question him hardly. Cause I go with the flow with what he wants. They dated for seven years. He said he feels superior to me intelligence wise and career wise. 

He said she is too smart, too quick, and challenges him too much physically, emotionally, and intellectually. He tells her I have emotional problems and need someone there cause I’m fragile. That he’s giving me a shot and if we don’t workout (which he told her he doesn’t think we will) at least he made me a better person. He told her his life is perfect except his relationship with me causes him angst at times. 

She’s super independent and travels alone and works out and has a good job and is a fitness model in addition to being a doctor and she was a college athlete and was an honors student. I just slid by in school, hate working out, and got a job in sales.

I snooped on his phone cause she kept calling him and realized a few things after reading their convos and our talks about her in the past. 

 I think he made his ex into a dependent person and she ended up getting fed up with it and left him when she realized she could be a complete and independent person on her own.

Yeah. Apparently when they met she had just moved to their city and had no friends. She only had him to hangout with for a few years while she stayed at home and went to community college which he was embarrassed to tell people about. He wouldn’t hang with her family and made excuses to leave because they made him feel weird. They only hung with his family and she loved them so she abandoned hers for his because he never seemed excited to be with her family. She then went to a top university and found a close group of friends and he alienated himself from her. She then became a much better person and was involved in her school, picked up extra jobs (he never worked in college), did her AND his schoolwork so he could pass, and she graduated as an honors student from a top 30 university and got a job with a promising future and made more money than him. He cheated and blamed her for her being too controlling which is why he said he cheated but begged for her back when the new girl left him. He used to prevent her from leaving the house when they fought and also would stalk her location on her phone when they broke up so he could creep on what she was doing and would even secretly hide at places and watch her do stuff when she hung with her friends. She said she wishes she could record their convos because he always denied what he said previously if it didn’t currently benefit him and apologized for her feelings instead of his actions that caused those feelings. She thought all this shitty behavior was due to him being young. 

He now tells her he admires her independence and how she always tries to be her best yet says he loves how I make him feel he is the man cause I am inferior in all ways compared to her and don’t really fight back and I do as he says. He also says he isn’t excited about our future together but is giving me a chance. We have dated 1 year 

He once told her I can have my pick of the litter cause I am a college athlete, I have a nice car, live in a high rise, and owns a company (he works for his moms company)

Also, why won’t he date her if she’s that cool and wants to date him. She feels she ruined the relationship and learned to just submit to what he says because if not he will deny everything she says and make her feel she is crazy and is the problem so therefore she thinks she causes him to act in certain ways and if she was better he would treat her better. 

WHY WONT HE LEAVE ME IF HE THINKS SO POORLY OF ME ?

Edit: I reached out to the ex today and literally he would tell her she was so annoying and stressful and was ruining his life so she said okay bye then and he would get so mad and say why is that your default response to issues we have? And she told him it’s because he didn’t seem happy and she wasn’t going to make someone he with her. And he would get upset and ask her to not leave when he literally just told her he was miserable with her

b7aizm,Is it abuse if its not directed at me?,"My boyfriend has been damaging our rental unit, from holes in walls, to slamming the fridge door so hard that the door shelves fall off, and most recently kicking open our front door with his steel toed boots so often the the glass finally shattered.

He damages the walls with his fists, his feet, and today, a work hammer lying around.

b7j785,Afraid,"I’m 19[F] I live with my father, brother, and stepmom, and I’m in a over one year relationship with my boyfriend.

Growing up I was abused a lot by ex’s as a small girl shy girl who had already had her trust broken and had been taken advantage of I was an easy target. I still am I guess..

My father isn’t very abusive but he has his moments of yelling. On the other hand, there is my brother and my stepmom who make my life a living hell and I feel like are constantly out to try to push me that much farther into depression and anxiety so that they won’t have to have me in their lives anymore.

My boyfriend on the other hand. My boyfriend is amazing. He’s helped me through so much, and has helped me through eating disorders, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. We’ve had arguments like every relationship has, but today. Today was different. 

We were talking and everything was alright, we were laughing and joking around about how his cat was high from surgery. But all the sudden the mood changed and he got really secluded. It’s happened before and I know it’s best to give him a little space and just ask if he needs to talk, if he says no then I’ll leave it at that. If yes I’ll help him through whatever is going on in his head. 

Today though, he screamed at me. He went off on me like I’ve never seen him do before and it took me right back to my past relationships where I would be in constant fear of being hit. I didn’t know what to do. After he calmed down and everything he apologized and ask if I was okay. I lied and told him I was. 

I was far from okay, I for the first time in our entire relationship with him, friendship then dating, I am afraid of him. I don’t know if it was just a one time thing, that whatever popped into his mind was that bad, or what happened. I don’t want to bring it up in fear of getting yelled at again. 

Do I tell him the truth that I’m afraid of him? Do I keep it to myself and hope it never happens again? What do I do? I’m lost and scared",Grey_Aether,2019-03-30 19:57:45,0,397,12.54,45,71.64,4.88,14.7,12.34,96.73,64.99,24.94,18.14,11.08,1.01,0,5.54,0.5,6.8,3.27,13.85,13.35,5.04,8.82,2.02,24.43,4.79,2.52,2.27,1.01,1.51,8.31,3.02,5.04,2.02,1.76,0.5,15.11,1.01,0.76,0.76,7.05,9.82,1.26,0.76,2.27,2.52,2.02,4.03,2.27,0.25,1.26,0.76,2.27,0.76,1.26,0,0.25,8.31,3.78,1.26,2.27,1.51,0.5,8.82,13.85,1.76,15.87,1.76,7.81,6.55,0,0.25,0,0,0.25,0.25,1.26,0.25,0,1.01,0,0,15.37,5.79,4.03,0,0,0.76,0,0,0,4.28,0,0.5
b7pb7i,What to do when your abuser is successful and you are not?,"My youngest sister texted me today to brag about getting into an Ivy League with a full scholarship. When I lived with my parents, she constantly tormented me. She would beat me, spread rumors about me to my parents, siblings, and anyone who would listen, among other things. I was so ashamed of being bullied and abused by my younger sister. Who would believe I was bullied by someone younger? Sure she was much, much bigger than me, but who would believe me?

I spent most of my time protecting my little brother from her, breaking up fights she started with others and taking the blows, and being driven to the brink of suicide due to her many, many times instead of being able to study and concentrate on my studies. This was in addition to the sexual abuse, mental abuse, and physical abuse from my father and others within the family and classmates. My grades suffered and I grew reclusive. For me, there was never an ability to get those kinds of scholarships, to go those kinds of schools. My family never abused her as they did me because I was stupid and tried to play the hero. As bottom of the pecking order there, me stepping in and helping helped them, but those people disrespected me and bullied me in turn so as not to become like me. All I have is mental illness to show from it.

Even now, I struggle. I have bad mental illness, no friends, awkward disposition, ugly features, better job but poor pay, poor social skills/life and real-world experience, shoddy/cluttered apartment, and lackluster/depressing love life, poor physical health. 

I am working on improving things: I am going to school to get a degree (been in school forever due to working, but just have year left), going out and working on social skills and meeting people, working on learning new skills (programming, gardening, cooking, knitting), starting exercising again (used to be much more healthy), fighting depression through working on these and cleaning more routinely, setting boundaries with family and lover, etc. I am not going to therapy though due to bad experiences. Things are getting better, but it makes me feel terrible that someone who bullied me to the brink of attempting suicide can succeed while I continue to flounder. It makes me wish I never existed; I already hate myself, but feel even worse. What's the point of continuing?

b7qac3,I saw my SIL Today &amp; we briefly chatted (we have similar experiences),"I talked to my sister in law and after quickly self reflecting on it I could've done better in communication with her. 

She has an alcoholic husband (I was told by my other brother that he smashes her stuff sometimes) and she looked like a mess with no makeup on. Anyways she stopped by and talked to me asking how I am. I told her that I try to walk 3 miles a day for my mental health and work out. 

I never asked her how she was feeling &amp; felt bad that I was shy. She eventually stopped talking when I was  seeing how my nephew was doing &amp; it may have seemed like I didn't care about her. 

Anyways, she looked like hell and I wanted to really ask this inmediately: ""How are you feeling?"" &amp; ""I know my brother is an alcoholic and I want to help you get out of that situation."" 

I didn't say that but felt I should've after reflecting on my communication with her. I'm gonna probably add her on Facebook tonight and maybe tell her I support her. I just think she's mentally battered and she's having another kid in the summer. 

Hell, it's so toxic with my parents that when I mention seeing my SIL they get inmediately jealous that they don't see their grandkid because she bring him to her family's house.

b7yxqe,Am I overreacting?,"Sometimes my parents will talk to me about stuff, and they may accuse me of being wrong about something or doing something wrong, but only because “they have lived longer than I have and so they no more”. If I try to refute them or tell them a claim they are making is wrong (no matter if it’s a small detail or an overall concept), they yell at me for not agreeing with them. If I show any frustration, they will tell me not to be frustrated “or I won’t like the consequences.” I don’t think that it is right to dictate how someone should feel. I would get it if I was some middle-school student yelling at them. However, their version of “frustration” is me having a serious face and silently listening to them. Also, I’m in college. So I guess my question is am I overreacting? Additionally, this is in conjunction with other abusive tendencies from my parents, but I wanted to know more about this particular behavior.

Anyway, they've been such good friends before they were in a relationship together and after they exchange their feelings or whatever they did, the guy starts acting like such a dick to her all the time and starts constantly putting her down for everythi bt even if shes doing something good for him. She however makes excuses to why he acts that way towards her though all her friends and others say she needs to break up with him. They've been together for a year or so. He dumped her on their anniversary and came back to her the day after. Its come to the point that she has to ask permission to HIM before she can go do things with her own family or friends. But HE can do whatever he wants. He blames his actions on his father and how he is towards him because his dad has always forced him basically 24/7 to eat drink and breath baseball.

b84hkv,Is this normal? + needing advice,"When I was little, my mom and I were very close. Almost too close. She regularly showed favoritism towards me, and left my sister on the sidelines. She often accused her of being demon possessed and mentally ill, which eventually led her to use various forms of corporal punishment. My sister has confessed to me that around this time, in the middle of the night when she had to go to the bathroom, she was too afraid to leave her room because she felt that our mom would punish her for it. She ended up wetting the floor, and my mom was all too quick to blame her for this.

&amp;#x200B;

Around the time I turned 13, the 3 of us downsized substantially into a 2 bedroom townhome, and entered one of the most stressful periods of our lives. I started to develop my own fashion tastes and personal beliefs, which often contradicted my mother's. She didn't like this a bit. The fact that she had already grown exceedingly paranoid made the situation much worse, so with time, she began to shut me off from the rest of the world. It got to the point where she ran some of my only friends off of our property whenever they wanted to play with me. Eventually, I was only allowed to hang out with other kids once a week at my drama class. Keep in mind that both me and my sister have been forcibly homeschooled for most of our lives, so we were very isolated.

Understandably, my mom was very upset about this, so she forced me into confessing my personal struggles to her. I have lapses in my memory, so it's hard for me to remember exactly how this all played out, but I remember that she had become completely fed up with my change in disposition. This is when her punishments started.

&amp;#x200B;

After rummaging through my laptop and search history, she found out that I had become an atheist. This was what she used to justify pinning me to my bed by the throat, striking me across the face, throwing objects at me, pulling my hair, and so on. To be completely honest, I actually preferred her physical abuse over her psychological, because the things she said to me on a regular basis almost drove me into taking my own life. At times, I think she even wanted me to attempt suicide so that she could have me baker acted, and paint me to look like the crazy one throughout all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

The abuse continued for a very long time after this, until she had completely stripped me of my individuality. I gave up fighting, and decided to conform to her standards of perfection. This included pretending to become a Christian again. Since then, the physical abuse has completely stopped, and now she's showing favoritism towards me again. A while after the incidents that transpired, I resorted to disorderly eating habits as a way of coping with the residual trauma that she left, and ended up losing up to 15 lbs. I've gained 6 of those lbs. back, and although I'm still struggling with hyper vigilance and anxiety, I'm in a much better place than I was in back then.

&amp;#x200B;

The main thing that worries me right now is my sister. She's 19, still has a learner's permit, and my mom refuses to teach her how to drive. She won't even let her hold down a part time job. I'm 2 years younger than her, and our mom seems more willing to help me learn how to drive than her, who should've been her main priority. She tells me that she doesn't even feel comfortable bringing my sister to social gatherings, because she thinks she's too antisocial, and basically a lost cause. The only way my sister can get out of this situation is if I get out first, and honestly, that scares the shit out of me.

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend of 9 years is in a very similar situation, and we've come up with a plan to escape together. Normally, my mom would be horrified at the thought of me moving out, but with my friend added to the equation, she seems more open to it. Since I can't drive and don't have a job, I don't know how I'm going to save up enough money for this. My friend has been making some money by selling fursuits, and says that her mom may let her get a job sometime this year too. My mom isn't exactly thrilled with the thought of me holding down a part time job while in college, so does anyone know how I can effectively make money online? I'm pretty artistic, but I don't know how I can use my abilities in a profitable way.",Dankertist2,2019-04-01 09:16:24,6,849,47.6,50.94,73.32,5.59,19.74,16.96,90.69,59.01,20.26,15.55,9.31,0.94,0,5.18,0.12,4.71,5.54,15.43,7.77,7.18,6.6,0.94,16.02,4.12,2.24,1.77,1.41,2.24,5.3,1.53,3.42,1.06,1.3,0.71,11.19,1.88,0.47,7.07,0,12.01,3.53,3.18,1.18,1.88,1.65,1.53,1.18,0.47,0.24,0.35,1.53,0.35,0.71,0,0.47,7.89,2.59,1.41,2.83,1.41,0.71,6.6,8.48,1.06,16.73,2.36,7.89,6.71,2,0.47,0.59,0.59,0.59,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0,16.73,4.71,6.12,0,1.41,0.24,0,0,0,2.71,0,1.53

b868mh,my 'home' isnt a home for me. (help please?),"i wanted to ask if it is okay for your mother to treat you badly because of something you cant even remember doing? my mom pinches me, slaps me all around my body, even my private parts. she usually mocks and teases me like ""your boobs are big"" ""i can see the hair under your ——(i dont wanna continue that)"". she misgenders me sometimes, calling me ""baby boy"" and i never agreed to let her call me that, because it flat out makes me feel uncomfortable. other than that though, she is somewhat a good mother. but should i just brush off all the things she did to me? 

my mom and i recently fought, its been a couple of days, and now that im writing about it, i cant remember why we fought. but, pushing that aside, shes ignoring me now. she doesnt take notice of me, she doesnt even feel or act sorry and all those things. whenever i did something wrong or i just ignored her, she loudly rants and talks angrily about me, and i cant help but feel like i wanna cry and break down and all those shit. my other family members know about this, hell most of them do.

my grandmother called me the other day, and told me to apologize and just hug her and do all those bittersweet stuff families do. i felt like she's guilt-tripping me, because she says my mom 'secretly' cries in the bathroom, but she was never here to confirm that my mom actually cries in the bathroom. when i told my grandmother that i cry too, she just brushes it off. i dont really know what to do at that point and just said my goodbyes.

my grandfather knows we fought. to summarize my grandfather's personality, he's kind but also narcissistic sometimes. when he tries to confront me about it, and push me to just apologize to my mom, i defended myself, ""i dont want to!"" ""im not ready yet"" or just plain ignoring what he says. but whenever i try to say something back, he gets overly defensive and huffs and puffs and literally PUSHES DOWN WHAT I KEEP TRYING TO SAY TO HIM. Im not fucking ready, im terrified of my mom. i dont want to be around her.

its not the first time my mom and i fought. we fought a lot of times, and that just fills up the reasons why im so terrified of her.

i dont know if this is just a phase or not, but ive been feeling down a lot. i feel depressed and just want to hide but i dont know what to say or how to say it because people sometimes think its just a ""typical thing people feel these days, it will go away"" or just brush off it as some kind of a joke or something not that serious.

i cant lie though when im asked if i didnt do self-harm. i did before the fight happened, and it never helped? it actually made things worse. my family found out quickly (mom,grandfather,sister) and when asked about it, i just felt terrified and started regretting it and made up lies, like ""i accidentally shaved this part too roughly"" . i knew my sister was uncomfortable around me, my grandfather and i knew that i was lying, and my mom, she comforted me at the middle of the night, saying that everything is okay and she'll beat up the person who made me felt like this. i didnt have the heart to tell her that she was apart of this, in all these stresses.




whenever we gather and eat at the living room/dining room to eat, i dont sit at the table, i seat at the couch next to the wall and somewhat close to the table. whenever i get food, i just quickly grab the food and just immediately sit back down. i barely talk throughout the whole thing. i still remember, my grandfather trying to include me to the conversation, and i just kept nodding and shrugging and kept replying with short responses. i dont feel happy around them anymore. i dont feel comfortable around them anymore, i dont feel like im apart of the main family. i felt horrible for just brushing my grandfather away like that, im sorry.


what should i do? if i tell them and say that i want to move away from them, i know that i dont have that much places to go to. i cant stay at my grandmother's, her place is too small, and is only one room. i cant live with my uncle and auntie because they are currently going through some relationship problems and they already have a child of theirs having such horrible health and is probably spending a lot of money.

so, yeah, that's kind of all what i wanted to say. ive been planning this for a while, two or three days ago really. i just had the guts to do it now, after being subjected to my mom's ranting about me not being able to close the lights outside.

b88ycs,I feel like I can’t escape my past abusive relationship.,"Last year, my ex and I got an apartment together (both of our names on the lease), once we moved in, that’s when he started to turn on me. My confidence was stripped from me, he wanted me to move to his city so I felt so distant from all of my friends and family back in my town, he would always put me down and make me feel like everyone was against me, and that he was all I had, it escalated into more personal attacks that would take a while to even put into words. I realized 6 months in, I needed to leave, and after resisting his control, I made the decision to leave which resulted in us breaking our lease. He couldn’t afford to stay there by himself, and the lease break would be $1700 for the both of us, thankfully I set up a 6 month payment. Fast forward to now, I feel like I have to remain in contact with him to make sure that things are being paid - because I do not want this to go into collections or to end up in a court room with him in the long run. All this worry is eating me up inside and I just wish I could move on from this quickly, I want to heal myself but I’m so focused on making sure that he’s paying his half so I never have to see him again. I’m sorry if this is all over the place - any advice or tips would be helpful, whether it’s with how to self heal/moving on or how to not worry so much over this lease break.",slowdiiiv,2019-04-01 14:00:30,0,289,43.66,35.16,93.52,38.04,36.12,11.07,95.16,62.28,22.15,16.96,10.73,1.73,0,4.5,0,5.19,3.46,18.69,8.3,5.19,7.96,1.73,20.76,1.73,1.73,1.73,1.73,3.11,4.5,2.42,1.73,0.69,0.69,0.35,10.38,0.35,0.69,0,4.5,16.26,2.08,3.11,4.15,1.73,3.46,3.46,1.73,0.35,0,1.38,1.04,0,0.69,0,0.35,7.96,3.46,0.35,3.46,1.04,0.35,4.84,12.46,0.35,22.49,5.54,11.76,6.57,0.69,0.35,2.42,2.42,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,12.46,2.77,5.19,0,0,0,0,0.69,0,2.42,0.69,0.69

(On phone)

My story starts only when I’m 2, my stepdad comes into the scene. Yadda yadda ya, skip until I around about 6.

This is when it starts, I can’t remember exact details, but I remember drawing my name on the wall (styrofoam walls?) and I had a massive go at it for it. Then that’s when things escalated from them, like for a instant I couldn’t find a plate. I was strung up by my neck. Or I accidentally fell onto my brothers head, dragged from outside, up the stairs and into my room then beaten black and blue. My screams would fill the house and yet no one cared. Because I had no saying.

Fast forward until last year october, we had gone over to my grandparents to go see them. I was upset because my “dad” was going to hit me infront of a lot of people in a supermarket. But then said go sit in the car, I was baling my eyes out. When they came back, I didn’t say anything and we drove off. 

My grandad sees my face and asks to talk to me, I break down crying and told him everything. In comes mum and we say it’s about bullying.

b8a68l,Does this count as sexual abuse and is it worth confiding in a parent?,"For some background: F,19. I recently realised that when I was around 7 I was sexually abused by my sister who is 3 years older than me. If I'm thinking correctly, it began by her showing me videos of girls kissing to which I said was disgusting - not because it was two girls but because she'd show me gross tongue kissing videos - and she'd agree. I don't know how it began from there because I only distinctly remember three instances of it happening but I know it happened more. She would have us kiss which I didn't want to do but my sister has always been manipulative, I don't remember how she got me to go along with any of it and I also had no idea what it even was, just that it was something to keep secret. I think it just started small but she progressed it to tongue kissing (only on her end) but I'd say that it felt weird and I didn't want to do it but she still tried. One of the three experiences I distinctly remember was when we were at the swimming pool and my grandad had left to get changed and she convinced him that we would hang around for five minutes more. Anyway, I don't think she knew but my grandad was watching from the balcony area and she tried multiple times to kiss me but the lifeguard was watching and this was something I knew had to be a secret between us both. When we left the pool, my grandad asked what we were doing, why we were kissing in the pool and I said that she just did it out of no where. Another instance, my mum was at work and my grandma was taking care of us, we were upstairs playing dolls and she locked the door and instigated it, having me remove my clothes. This was the first time and only time (I believe, I honestly don't know for certain) that I was naked and she had me sit on top of her whilst she was clothed. I was just chatting normally about my dolls and stuff because I had no idea what was actually even going on but she must have. The final experience I remember was when we were at my dads house but he was off with his girlfriend, we were playing a game and she was trying to kiss me whilst we laid on the bed and I told her I didn't want to do that and that it was weird. I believe that was the last time she ever did anything sexual with me however I'm not so certain. I'm not even sure if I was sexually abused by her, I always thought that she was only 10/11 so maybe she had no idea about sexual stuff like that, when I was at that age I didn't, however I was a really late bloomer and if she was already looking at videos of girls kissing then she must've had sexual feelings. I just knew that I never wanted to do anything she made me but she had convinced me somehow that it was okay and normal even though I knew no one could find out. It's always been something I was ashamed of and felt disgusting about, but I was a child and I had no idea what was happening. I never thought I was sexually abused because she was a child too. Anyway, I don't know whether to tell my mum. Her and my sister aren't close, she no longer lives with us and my relationship with my sister has always been bad but very good with my mum. I only realised what actually happened to me yesterday morning and it's been tearing me up since, I can't concentrate and I'm crying in class. I feel like I really want to tell her, but how do I tell her that my sister may have sexually abused me? I feel like I was some kind of accomplice, or wilful participant but I wasn't. Does this even count as sexual abuse? Should I tell my mum or forget about it? How do I tell her without feeling like it was my fault or without her thinking it was nothing? Was this a normal part of other people's childhood? I know there's a lot of questions and I've never used Reddit before so I might have done this all wrong but I just don't know what else to do, I have no one else I could tell.

TL;DR - my sister ‘groomed’ me into kissing her when I was 7 and she was 10 even though I didn’t want to or understand it, I always thought she didn’t understand it either so never considered it sexual abuse despite being ashamed of it. Do you classed this as sexual abuse? Is it worth telling a parent?

b8c1eq,Questioning if its really abuse,"It wasn't until recently that I've come to terms with the fact that I may be in an abusive situation. I used to think that it was normal, or I was just emotional and overreacting. I've never been physically abused anyway, so my situation doesn't count as abuse, right? I get an allowance, I'm allowed to have hobbies, I'm fed and theres a roof over my head. Abusers don't let their victims have their own things, right? 

   Once I started considering that what I was going through was emotional abuse, I used to scold myself. I was overreacting. Besides, my parent had a very rough childhood, and had gone through horrible things in their life. So who was I to compare my hiccups to their situation?
   
   I made a longer post about this on another sub, but basically heres the climax that made me realize what could be going on. I am homeschooled, and have been for many years. In 2017, I had to switch homeschool programs which resulted in me starting my first year of highschool in November. I was expected to complete both semesters by June. 10 months of work in just 6 months. Obviously I failed meeting that deadline, and due to a mix of things didn't end up completing 9th grade until December of last year. I was put in a shitty situation that set me up for failure, and then was blamed for it and put down for it constantly.

  I was told that I had ruined THEIR summer, and how THEY had been stuck at home all summer, even though they were an adult. There was no empathy for how hopeless and alone I felt. I felt like giving up, like ending it because I was so stressed. For the last year before that I had been mentally okay, but after the year of schooling hell my anxiety issues and depression had resurfaced. 

  It didn't matter how I felt. I started thinking back to how I had been treated whenever something came up. Yelled at for hours about the smallest, meaningless things. Reduced to hyperventilating and tears for something that could of been corrected with a simple demand. Things that have already passed being brought up. Family members being shit talked, only to pair me with them whenever they were upset. 
 
  It could be anything. A dish, the couch, my apperance. It didn't matter. It wouldn't be mentioned for weeks, then suddenly she would have a problem with it. She would yell and yell, mentioning everything she could think of to keep the arguement going. I would stay quiet and as respectful as possible, even if they were in the wrong (for example, yelling at me for a dish that they had used, telling me I didnt clean it right even though they were the one who cleaned it.) Because I didn't want to cause trouble. Besides, she had anger issues. She didn't mean it. 

  Lately, at the end of these fights, when I'm at my emotional worst, shes been pressuring me into talking about how I feel. Saying things like, 'The only way I can make you feel better is for me to know how you feel'. I don't trust her with knowing how I feel, because its always used against me. 

 For example, recently I got my hair cut really short. We stopped at the store on our way back home. I told her I was going into the bathroom to look at the haircut more in detail and fix it up. After I was done, and felt confident with how I looked (which is rare for me.), I exited the bathroom and joined her in line. She immediantly started messing with my hair and tucking it behind my ear (which I hate, and I've told her how much I hate how it looks and how I think it makes me look ugly, but she always ignores it and says that she knows what looks nice.) I flashed her an uncomfortable look. She didn't take this well, and got very angry with me, practically dragging me out of the store once everything was paid for. 

I quickly apoliogized and said ""I'm so sorry, I didn't mean for it to come across that way, I'll try to be more aware of that in the future."" But she wasnt having any of that. 

She hammered me about how disrespectful I was, and how she wishes she could of had her mother do things like that when she was younger, and how I'm going to miss her when shes gone. I ended up having a bad panic attack in the car. We stopped at a gas station. And instead of just going in and getting what she needed so that we could get home, she decided to start asking me on why I looked so annoyed about the hair thing. We were parked in the front of the gas station, being able to see in the glass windows of the shop. People were walking past, standing outside, and she made me sit there for almost what felt like 30 minutes, just digging into me trying to make me confess how I was feeling. Every time I would give her an answer, she wouldn't accept it and kept asking questions. All I could do is sit there and wait for it to be over, picking at my scabs and biting my lip to try and ground myself from breaking down completely.  

When we finally got home I felt so tired. So emotionally drained. I wanted nothing more then to go in my room, sleep, and never wake up. I ended up feeling terrible about my haircut and it took me a while to build back my confidence. 

 My friend is a similar (all be it worse) situation. We plan on moving out asap and rooming together during college. So that we can have a chance at freedom. (I brought this up and she has since then tried to derail the situation, saying the only way I'll make it is if I live with them through college or join the military, and that I'm just setting myself up for failure.) 

 But still, I question if this is abuse. I'm allowed to do the things I want. I have a bank account. I make costumes and I'm allowed to sell them. I'm currently learning how to drive. I get an allowance every month. There are times that I legitimately have a good time with her. But I feel like I have to walk on eggshells. Like one wrong move and I get flipped upside down. It leaves me feeling empty and worthless. I dread getting up in the morning, having to deal with what could happen. But I also feel bad for feeling like I'm being abused. I don't know how to feel anymore.",theatrenerdnight,2019-04-01 17:40:52,1,1151,22.1,26.29,86.22,1,14.95,15.12,93.66,62.64,22.15,15.2,10.51,0.7,0.17,2.61,1.22,6.95,4.34,14.68,11.12,7.04,8.69,1.74,23.37,3.91,2.35,3.04,0.78,1.13,6.26,1.04,5.21,0.7,2.17,1.04,7.82,0.26,0.09,2.52,0,14.25,3.39,3.65,2.35,1.82,1.65,2.52,3.3,0.7,0.87,1.56,1.65,0.78,0.52,0,0.35,7.38,1.39,1.3,3.04,1.3,1.3,8.95,9.9,1.48,16.07,2.26,7.21,6.95,1.3,0.43,0.96,0.61,0.17,0,0.61,0.26,0.09,0.09,0.09,0.09,15.38,6.43,4.95,0,0,0.26,0,0,0.17,2.69,0.87,0

b8hzw9,my 'home' isnt a home for me. (additional info—),"i realized that i didnt put much details about my mother's past in my previous post so ill put them here. 

my mom is divorced, she told me a story when i was young that my father left my sister and i when we were born, amd that my father had been seeing someone else. my grandmother came from a bad past, (recently told by my grandfather, yesterday i just remembered about it) and she was really strict about my looks and actions. maybe my mother was affected like me but im not sure.

my mother is easily angered. she sometimes takes things seriously and snapped at others when we said something that irked her. she sometimes shouts at my sister and i when we changed channels of the tv, did something that we werent supposed to do or didnt do something she wanted.

i still remember to this day, when i was about 6-11 years old (i cant remember what age exactly but i remember the events) she was helping me wash myself, and i remember while she was washing my private parts, she asked me if it tickles. i dont know if i should take it as some form of sexual harassment or not, but i was uncomfortable everytime i recalled it. 

my grandmother always points out my acne, my problems with my body, and what i eat. she always says that ""you wont get any boys to like you if you have pimples and acne"" or ""youre eating too much"" and keeps forcing me to exercise even though i dont want to. 

actually, my grandmother is at my house right now, she's staying here for a while, and while we ate, she told me to apologize to my mom and keeps pushing me to do it. and when i told her ""no, not yet"" she told me that were going to talk later. remember that part when i mentioned that she called me one time, telling me that my mother cries at the bathroom but wasnt there to confirm it? she actually sent a message before the call. she told me to be sensitive about this, and told me that my mom was just stressed. i didnt reply to that text because honestly, i was just in disbelief. she noticed my mothers problems but not mine? she talks about what my mom is going through, but never takes time to look and see what im going through.

i have gotten some advice, and i really thank everyone who helped me. i was really thankful, and still thankful right now. but i know that you guys know that im still afraid of confronting my mom.",ilikecolorred,2019-04-02 04:29:46,2,456,2.33,25.52,96.94,16.38,19,15.35,96.71,62.72,29.39,21.93,15.35,1.1,1.1,4.17,0.22,7.46,1.97,8.33,8.77,8.11,9.43,3.51,21.93,2.41,1.1,2.63,0.66,1.32,4.17,1.75,2.41,0.66,0.66,0.22,17.11,4.17,0.22,7.46,1.1,15.57,2.85,0.66,1.75,3.73,1.54,7.02,1.54,0.88,0.66,0,2.63,0.22,1.54,0.22,0.66,3.95,1.75,0,0.44,1.1,0.66,11.62,8.99,0.88,12.94,2.41,2.41,8.11,0,0.88,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.6,4.61,4.82,0,0,0.44,0,0.22,1.32,0.88,1.32,0

b8mgb0,I am one of those guys and I hate myself for it,"I've had a rocky past and where to begin probably dwindles down to my childhood. 
Grew up with two great parents, a brother &amp; sister. All of us are close in age and have a solid connection. No abuse, no sexual abuse. Just a loving family that are all best friends. 
I think I was born depression because I've always been over emotional and empathetic towards others. I tend to feel others pain and hardship too much. I've tried to block it out, but I can't seem to lose it. 

My parents got divorced when I was about 13. At that time I gave into to becoming a full-time smoker of cigarettes And pot. It was too easy because my mom would ask me to score her some maybe once a month. So we all took advantage of this. 
I started ditching school, getting high daily, drinking copious amounts of alcohol. Like what 13 year old keeps bottles of liquor in their sock drawer to drink daily? I guess I did and knew I was heading down the wrong path. From there I started experimenting with more drugs and doing as I pleased. My parents couldn't control me and don't think they wanted to. 
Eventually the law came knocking for truancy. Weekend stints in jail and numerous group homes where I kept meeting some of the best and worst people. The drugs were plentiful around these places which only made things worse. 

Eventually after turning 17 and being able to not be in trouble for school I completely dropped out. This led to even more poor decisions. 
By mid way through 17 I had a family friend who was 15 that I had slept with. She felt ashamed (as did I) and her parents found out we had sex. They went to the police and I was arrested and charged with criminal sexual conduct. Because of not having parental permission it was considered a sex crime. (I am still friends with her and her brothers). 
Now this is where I think everything went down hill even more. I'm embarrassed, she's embarrassed, the state is coming after me And I end up just pleading out because I was so afraid. 
More jail, probation and depression ensued and wanted so badly to just die. Like a legit death wish came on strong. I thought about it daily. Wondering why I went from having a great childhood to being tossed into an unforgiving legal system. 
I don't blame anyone for my actions and take on full responsibility. 
By the time I was 18 I started to get my.lofe back on track. Had a great girlfriend who I'd known for years prior. We both worked, ate copious amounts of food and watched tons of movies. She was a recovering addict and we clicked cause we both had been through it before. I can say that she has a family now and obviously kicked all that crap. 
Through out my 20's I ended up dating a few women. Women I still keep in contact with and that I'm glad to have shared the experience of a relationship. 
Things kept looking up. I'm finally getting my life on track, working and just being responsible. I drank maybe once a week if that and was just trying to stay focused. 

I decided by the age of 27 that I was ready for college. I had got my GED at the age of 19/20 I believe so it was enough to get me rolling. 
I ended up moving to Florida. Things were looking up even more. I moved into a beautiful house on a lake with 5 amazing women and one gay guy who was also an amazing person. 
Tragedy struck one night. 
At a local bar with my roommates having fun. Met the owner of a barbershop who did specialized fades and designs for men. He has us in to drink the beer and wine he has on tap in his barbershop. (Pretty rad I thought). Eventually after hanging briefly we invite him and his two cousins with us to the bar next door. 
Night was fun until things took a huge turn. 
I noticed that night a big group of gangbangers hanging in the parking lot. I didn't think much of them and just minded my own. 
A women was leaving the bar and I noticed the guys starting to hound her. Again none of my business, but definitely rude. 
Bamn! this guy socks the woman in her face. She hits the pavement hard. I've already got my old candy bar cellphone out of my pocket ready to phone the police. 
The man proceeded to pick her up after punching her in the face and dropped her on her head. I can hear people laughing at this. I put my phone away cause there is no way in hell I'm going to watch someone die in front me. I ran over to her aid as this guy is going at her a third time. I don't remember much, but I recall getting kicked in the face repeatedly. I wake up in an ambulance. My jaw was fractured in four places, had multiple teeth missing, broken nose, loss of feeling, etc... The list goes on. 
Went in for emergency reconstructive facial surgery. I remember crying. This was a bad situation. Witnesses said there were more than 10 guys kicking me in the face. I will say that if I'd died that night, it would've been painless. I think I went into some form of shock and wasn't fully conscious. 
That was hell. After that I went into a very dark place. I wanted death more than anything and wished that they'd just taken care of me completely. Actually surprised they didn't kill me. Found out this property had over 500 violent incident reports over the years. 
I end up moving home after this leaving school early. I was too hurt to mangled looking to even finish school. 
I got called every name in the book after that. Went down to 128 pounds and I'm 6'0"". That was due to eating out of a straw. So missing teeth and looking frail will make people question whether you're on something. 
That kept causing me even more depression. 

Now jumping ahead just a bit here to get on with my point of this post. 
I'm battling depression, severe anxiety, PTSD along with ice pick headaches almost daily. I faked a stomach ulcer and over dosed on pills. A whole lethal combination of 92 to be exact. Didn't tell anyone what was up. Just decided I was going to go to sleep for ever. 
I wake up in the hospital the next day with an IV in my arm. I hallucinated for days after that. Bugs on my food, the walls and had a conversation with my brother for a whole day not realizing he wasn't even there. Was definitely scary. 
I knew it was time to get help. I went to counseling on my own free will. I had to. It was time. The problem is that when I did see someone I was so embarrassed about all the crap I had been through I started lying. Which doesn't help at all in therapy. So I really wasn't getting much off my chest. I knew the PTSD was getting worse as the days passed. 

Jump ahead again. I start to feel better about certain aspects of my life. Then one night I met this wonderful woman while leaving my job one night. She invites me to come hang in her hot tub. I end up going with her and have a pretty great night. I liked her too. She was smart, snarky and had this thing about her that just seemed pure. I'm over here broken and alone wanting someone great in my life. 
So it turns out she was a virgin at 27 years old. We don't even have a sexual relationship until about 6 months I to dating. I knew I could wait and didn't want her to feel pressured. She'd waited for someone right and I thought she deserved better than myself. 
One day while at work she called me to say one of the guys at her office fired her. She was upset crying. I told her ""we'll be okay"". She then tells me she's ready to take the next step in our relationship and have sex. I couldn't agree immediately and asked if that's what she really wanted? 
She said ""yes"". 
Jumping ahead a little more. Her and I are living together. Im already seeing that I'm messing the relationship up. I had a habit of talking with other women often. I have a face that says handsome and successful. Yet, that wasn't the case really. I was miserable, depressed again and afraid eventually the PTSD would get the best of me. 
We started getting rocky and I took up more drinking than usual. 
I told her and because I loved her that if we didn't break up I was afraid I would eventually hurt her. I don't know why we continued to date after o kept saying this, but we mutually loved each other and she must of had a ton of faith in me. 
I had a house in California I was renting and was going to split my time between. She didn't like that and she knew I would talk to to other women. I get the distrust now And nobody deserves that crap. It still eats me up inside. 
One night I went out with two friends. Both being best friends too. We went to some bars and eventually back to a hotel room we got because we were all too drunk yo drive or do much. I was so drunk that I woke up still completely wasted. 
Coming to that morning I noticed about 25+ missed phone calls and another 25+ texts from my girlfriend. ""Why didn't you come home?"" And so on. They kept getting worse and worse. The final text was ""your shit is in a pile here, come grab it a get the hell out"". 
I promised her I would 100% be home that night. 
I snapped. Like totally snapped and hit the point I was so worried about. 
Once at the apartment and argument went on for about 30 mins and then I lost all control. I wanna blame the alcohol, the PTSD and all the other bullshit I had been through. 
I pushed her up to a wall by her throat. Now I'm actually living up to my worry for her. I tossed her down on the ground and hit her in the head and back. I don't say this cause I'm proud I say this now because of what I did. She didn't deserve that. It got even worse... 
I grabbed a knife and threatened to kill her. 
After that day I moved out and went to the house I had in California. We talked for a few more weeks and then I sunk into binge drinking daily. I went to prison over this for 10 months. It gave me time to reflect on my actions. 
That day is still my biggest regret in my whole life. If there was one thing I could take back, it would be that. 

I want to say sorry to anyone that has went through an abusive relationship. It makes me cry to think as a human, how wrong we can be at times ... How I can be. 
I'm sorry to all the victims out there and there are no excuses for it. I know I should've got help and instead became a monster. I'm sorry to all of you out there going through that crap. You don't deserve it.

b8pmr1,Are there resources for people who are family members of abusers who didn’t abuse anyone within the family?,"My dad recently lost his job after it came out that he sexually harassed/abused someone in his work. He has never been abusive or violent to me, my siblings (that I know of), or my mother (she confirmed this to me). I’m feeling lost and upset, and want to make connections with people with similar experiences / therapists who have dealt with stuff like this before, but all the resources I can find online are directed towards people who’s family members abused them or others within their family. My situation is different because I’m not the victim of my father’s abuse, but it is significantly impacting my mental health. I don’t want to frame myself as the “real victim” or blame my father’s accuser for disrupting my family, I just want to talk to someone about this, because I know I’m not the only one experiencing this.

b8um86,My Father,"I just wanted to talk about a some abuse me and my brother have gone through. So I'm still 15 but my brother is 21 and married now. 

This story is the first of two personal stories of my abuse. So my dad is mostly verbally/emotionally abusive but has been physically abusive in the past. So this story starts off when I was 13, me and my dad, my brothers, and cousin where coming back from a gamestop after buying some things for my Xbox one. We had gotten home and all piled into my room. But just before my dad had came in he grabbed a can of condensed air which you use to get rid of dust from computers and things. When my dad came in the room he started spraying my brothers with the condensed air and before he sprayed me I put the hood of my coat up so he couldn't spray me. This for whatever reason made him mad so he did what any reasonable parents would do in the given situation. He decided to throw me against the dog cages that where in the corner o my room and then proceed to do it again when I stand back up. After the second time he threw me down I got up and sat down on my couch really quick and so does my dad. Once I thought it was over he punched me in the knee when I was sitting down and said ""you shouldn't get upset when someone is trying to play with you!"" And that's all for that story. 

Onto my brother's story. So my brother had turned 18 a few months back at the time and was hoping he would have more freedom from my dad. Well one night he came back after 10:00pm and my dad was mad. My brother was in the hallway almost in my dad's room's doorway. My dad was yelling at him for being home late when my brother said ""I'm 18 now so I can leave whenever I want"". This angered my dad which them went up to his doorway and threw my brother against the hallway wall. When my mom tried confronting my dad on this he said my brother was in his face when we all clearly saw that he wasn't and my dad eventually started going hysterical calling my mom a witch. And that was the end of that. 

Finally my last story is from me again. So a little context. My grandmother had died a few months prior and we had got a lot of her stuff. So this happened about three days after my brother's birthday. I went and grabbed a plate from our cabinet and went to get a slice of my brothers birthday cake. My dad saw me and told me to ask my brother first. I did and he said I could so I started making my way back to the kitchen. Now note the plate I had was one of our grandmothers and it was pretty small. I started to slightly toss the plate up and down on my hand when I got to the kitchen. As soon as I entered the kitchen the plate slipped out of my hand and shattered on the ground. At the time my dad was looking for something to eat in our fridge. He turned around and looked at the plate and then to me after which he goes and punches me as hard as he can in my chest. The punch knocks me back and I loose all the air in my lungs. I try to recover but then he punches me again and getting in my face and saying ""you don't get punished enough"". That's the last of the stories at the moment.

b8v1b2,When did the rules change? (Rant),"This is a little bit of a rant, so feel free not to take it too seriously.  But it's something that kind of frustrates me, and it's just been gnawing at me for the last twenty years.  

When I was growing up, a few things became very clear to me.

1. Screaming and expressing anger are how to get obedience.  Greater volume equals faster compliance.
2. Anger is best demonstrated by physically breaking something.
3. Mistreating another person is how you demonstrate your superiority.  Intimidation is synonymous with respect.

Question:  When did the rules change?

I feel like these rules reflected reality up until I turned 22 or so.  And then, all of a sudden, this kind of behavior was no longer acceptable.  When I was a kid, violence was a normal part of lie.  You were allowed to be cruel and hateful to people, and the cruelest people were the ones who got the greatest rewards.  People respected the most hateful students in school.  My parents got compliance by smashing things.  If you didn't like someone, you just beat them up.  It was their own fault for deserving it.

So I accepted this as normal.  I went off to college.  I figured that if hateful, violent, people got respect and affection, I would be the most hateful and violent person I could be.  First, everyone feared and hated me, and then I got me into trouble with the cops.  So at this point I was still thinking, ""What the fuck?  Why does everyone get away with this but me?""

Then I entered the workforce.  Again, it was completely normal for superiors to treat junior employees with a mixture of abuse and condescension, and screaming.  Then by the time I got promoted to middle-management, this behavior was suddenly not okay anymore.  When I screamed at subordinates, I got in trouble for it.  Again...  ""What the fuck?  When did the rules change?  Why is this suddenly not okay?""

Intellectually, I get it:  Misbehavior was never to be okay, nobody appreciates hateful people, and getting abused isn't an excuse to abuse other people in return.  But here's my problem:  That is such a load of BULLSHIT.  Over and over and over in my life, I watched the shittiest, cruelest, most hateful people get rewarded while I got punished.  And then when I tried to do the same things they did, I got punished even more!  It doesn't make any sense and it frustrates the shit out of me to this day.

She's neglected to a point, reporting to me that whenever she gets injured (ie. fell down the stairs and broke her wrist) her mother simply tells her that ""it'll heal"" and that she didn't need to go to the hospital.

b96dr8,[28F] not sure how to stop abusive parents?,"My parents are very abusive and I'm not sure how to make it stop..

&amp;#x200B;

In the past I grew up with domestic violence from my father, my mum attempted to kill me and herself because of it, and after that I was forced to live with my father where I was physically abused until 15, the abuse was reported multiple times but it wasn't until I was covered with bruises that the cops finally took it seriously and stepped in, then I was put into a few abusive foster care homes..

My father still continued to be very emotionally abusive, but last year was physically abusive again..

&amp;#x200B;

Both my parents are very against me even dating anyone since my mum is against relationships because of the past domestic abuse and hasn't dated anyone since the divorce 23 years ago not trusting anyone, and my father just wants full control over me, so they both attempt to sabotage any relationships I have, even with friends.. 

My father has sabotaged many jobs I've tried to get, because he doesn't want me to work so I might be forced to live with and be dependant on him.. 

I've told both the bank and my doctor many times not to give any info to my family but they never listen to me..   
My father somehow gets a hold of all my bank statements, or he randomly shows up to my doctor appointments making public scenes, or is constantly cancelling appointments on me without me knowing..  
Recently I've been walking out of my doctor appointments because they allow my father in without my permission, my father won't leave and the doctor says ""he's just concerned and it's fine if he listens in"" and I keep telling them it's against my wishes and all this is unacceptable until I walk out because no one is listening..  


Both my parents call me hundreds of times, freak out saying I give them anxiety when I try to do anything and they're wanting me to be with them constantly saying it's unsafe for me to live or go outside alone without them..   
My father stalks me to harass me or makes big scenes demanding I leave where I am, saying crazy things like ""you've been outside long enough!"" or trying to guilt me that I'm upsetting him for what I'm doing and need to come home right now..

  
I'm never doing anything harmful, this always happens with him showing up to my friend's houses or me just trying to shop at the mall or grocery store.. basic daily life things.  


I've tried to get the police involved multiple times, but they usually just tell me ""they are your parents you have to respect them and they just care about you"" or tell me just to ""stay away from them, stay with friends"", and they don't really listen or help..

Usually they'll side with my parents doing nothing and just leave so the public scene starts up again worse after the police leave or they'll just ask my father to leave..  
A few times my father came back right after and I had to call the police multiple times, but they would just ask him to leave again and not change anything..  
I said can't he be arrested for harassment or trespassing, and they said that wasn't necessary for a ""misunderstanding like this"", and wouldn't do anything..  
I've even been told that the situation has to be a lot worse like me being clearly physically assaulted, not just family arguing..  


I've also tried going to the police station multiple times about it and also told them about the bank and doctor, but they didn't offer any help with the situation and were very dismissive each time..

&amp;#x200B;

Recently things haven't been going well with my boyfriend, so we've broken up.

So without my boyfriend around my father has been harassing me a lot more and trying to sabotage everything for me thinking he'll get full control over me..

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to take a train to an event I got tickets for, my father knew about it from my bank statement, physically grabbed me at the train station, was screaming in my face that it's too dangerous for me to go to the city and that I was trying to run away, and he prevented me from making my train and made me waste the money I spent..

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are very controlling and abusive with stalking, harassment, and sabotaging things for me. 

I recently broke up with my boyfriend so the harassment from my father has gotten a lot worse without my boyfriend in the picture.  
The police have been dismissive and not helping so far.

b99d0m,You’re ripped at every edge but you’re a masterpiece.,"TW 





I grew up knowing I was adopted, but I didn’t think I was loved any differently because of it. At the age of 5 two of my older relatives started to sexually abuse me, the abuse lasted for 7 years. I didn’t know or understand what was going on, I was angry all of the time, the only escape I had was sports. I saw counselors and slowly started to be able to feel and understand more emotions. I had extreme trust issues with my mom because she didn’t believe me when I told her what my cousins did to me when I was 5 so I kept my mouth shut because she didn’t care. I thought I was damaged goods, I wouldn’t amount to anything. But in high school I threw myself into sports and kept going to counseling. Once I graduated high school I found myself in an extremely abusive relationship. Thankfully I had the strength to leave and the support system to help me get strong again. Not too long after that I was in a car accident with a semi truck and thrown off the freeway. That was a huge wake up call. It showed me that God still had plans for my life and that I wasn’t just a waste and useless. I ended up back in another abusive relationship, I was taken advantage of sexually because apparently I wasn’t allowed to say no. I ended up getting pregnant and not knowing about it. 2 months after things were over he found me at a friends apartment and beat me in the parking lot. The police did nothing. 3 days later I had a miscarriage and that’s when I found out I was 2 months pregnant. And then I was blessed with my now husband who is fully supportive of whatever I need to help my anxiety, depression, and PTSD. He is a dream come true. So many people tell me that I have such a kind, loving and caring heart. They just see a young woman living a life she loves. But here’s me being transparent, here’s my story. I wouldn’t be here today without God’s grace and the love and support from my friends and family because they don’t let me give up on myself.❤️ God creates beauty from ashes.",krisjoyysmith,2019-04-03 23:48:00,1,397,26.55,14.5,98.26,76.89,15.88,15.87,94.46,59.19,20.15,16.12,13.6,0,0.5,1.51,0.5,4.03,5.54,11.59,9.82,5.29,8.06,3.53,20.91,3.78,1.26,1.76,2.02,2.02,7.56,5.04,2.27,0.25,1.26,0.5,9.82,1.76,0.5,1.51,0.76,11.59,3.02,1.76,0.76,1.26,1.26,3.78,1.76,1.01,0.25,0.25,3.53,0.76,1.51,1.01,0,10.58,3.53,1.26,5.29,1.01,0.5,10.58,8.06,1.01,15.62,2.52,6.8,6.8,1.51,1.01,0.5,0,1.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.59,6.3,2.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.78,0,0
b9avrt,How do I tell a friend that I think she is in an abusive relationship?,"A friend of mine has been in a relationship with a guy for around 2 years now.

Throughout the relationship, she has kept me informed on incidents occurring in their relationship. I have been uncomfortable for a long time, but it is only when I list them all here that I feel totally gobsmacked at the severity of it all.

He seems to have a need to control her and everything she does. For example: refusing to let her hang out with male friends because he feels it is inappropriate, pressuring her to have kids even though she isn't ready, verbally abusing her and threatening to break up with her when he is drunk, punching a hole in their wall when he lost his temper, and worst of all, ejaculating in her after she told him not to (and lied about wearing a condom in the first place).

Obviously these are all huge red flags and I don't know how I haven't spoken up sooner. I did tell her how shocked I was at the ejaculation thing, and I told her that it was sexual abuse because he did it without her consent. But then she somehow excuses it and convinces me that everything is fine, and I haven't liked to push the matter. She says things like 'I know what you're thinking, but trust me, I feel completely safe and he would never hurt me' and I feel like I just haven't understood their relationship and I don't say anything. But now I am looking back at everything and trying to figure out how on EARTH I been lead to believe that things are fine.

I now know that I really need to say something, because I am at a point where I am scared he will hurt her. I just have no idea how to do it. I am thinking of saying something like 'I am only saying this because I really care about you...I am really worried about how X is treating you. I think you deserve someone who will treat you with more respect. I know you say he would never hurt you, but things have been escalating, and if he is capable of punching holes in the wall, he is capable of hurting you'.

I need advice on what the best possible way to do this is, without causing her to get defensive. I know she is sensitive about him, so I would hate for her to push me away and lose the support of someone who is actually concerned for her wellbeing.

b9bb44,I could use an opinion. Maybe some love. (Very Long Read),"I am not good at writing even though I am an American.... Bear with me.   


How to start this? I will make this short as possible. Still it is a story of the abuse I went through. So grab a snack or a drink if you want to read this. Its long. Real long.  


My father, mother and I never got along. I was the black sheep when it came to the family mentality. I was a rebel. An outsider. My father would think beating me would set me right but, really it didn't. This began in New York City when I lived around Avenue K.  


My first time remembering his abusive ways was when I was a little kid, going to school (P.S 115.) I cried that I did not want to leave on my first day... This embarrassed my parents, so when I got home my father tied me up (Hands and feet), and placed a chair before me.  He broke a broom in half. Not the aluminum ones. This is the end of the 80s and the start of the 90s when brooms sticks where still made of heavy wood. He would raise my tied up legs so I was in a L pose with my back on the floor. He sat in the chair and my legs are now between his legs.  He used the stick to hit the soles of my feet, as hard as he can. I do not remember what happen after.  


Also we had this dirty furnace room. It was tiny with a water heater and other things. I think a air central conditioning unit. He would throw me in there when I do something bad and the furnace would make sounds that I did not like. My father said there is a monster in there lurking and he hoped it eats me. This traumatized me as a kid.  


I also remember him holding my head. He is a pretty big guy. His hand did wrap around half my head. He picked me up and smashed my cranium through the dry wall.  


Another punishment he does that is a slightly passive was this. Imagine you are made to face a wall. You put your hands high over your head touching the wall and made to stand on one leg... for hours.  


Last thing I remembered before we moved to another area was that my father took the same broom stick and beat me like a pinata on my right hip. There was massive bruising there. I was limping. My teacher noticed and suspected abuse when I showed it to her. I lied though. My father made me lie.  


Then we moved to Sheepshead Bay. I kind of liked it there. On weekends my mom and I go out. She will check out the fish market, where fishermen sell their catches.   
However, the abused of course continued. My father slapped me around for playing with a worm. I was 10 at the time and I know now it is normal for boys around my age to play with creepy crawly things. When my father slapped it was not the ones that make your face turn. No. He does it as hard as he can knocking me to the floor.  


I misbehaved at school again, and my father woke me up at 1 in the morning. This was my first time being awake this late at night. He asked ""You know what time it is?"" And I remember shaking my head. He replies. ""Its 1 in the morning."" and I was confused. As a kid I thought night meant darkness and morning means when the sun rises. I remembering replying. ""Its not morning. Its still night."" I am not sure what what said after that but I do remember my father made me do the hands up and stand on one leg on the wall thing for the rest of the morning until the sun rose. I was tired as a overworked mule when I went to school.  


There were fights between my mother and my father. Sometimes the fights got so bad, he spends the night at a friend's place leaving my mother in tears. Sometimes he got physical. Rewind to when I was a child, before I went to school. I remember I saw my first fight between them. I had to be maybe 3 or 4 years old. My mother took scissors out to defend herself and I can tell now my father is holding her back from stabbing him. It was brutal.  I was hiding in the shadows, the far side of the living room watching. I did not understand what was happening that time.   


When the fight was over my father took her to the bed room and locked the door. I came out of hiding, and saw drops of blood for the first time. It was on the floor. I did not know what it was. I remember thinking it has to be rubies. Like the jewel on one my mother's rings I like to look at when she held me. She wears three rings. I touched it and it was water, and I thought to myself ""Water rubies?""   


Now fast forward back to me being 10. I was tied up a lot, beaten, punished for the slightest misbehavior. Children around my age love to explore things and touch. My father hated that. When I would go shopping with them I would touch things, to see how they worked. I had a knack for touching things, looking, exploring with my hands. Taking apart my toys and see the inner workings and understand how it worked. It was my way to explore the world. I understood engines and car maintenance at such a young age. My father would take me to the junk yards a lot to look for car parts. As he is busy I would mess around with things. My hands covered in rust and grease.  


If I was caught touching things in stores, when I got home I got a beating. Another way, he would make me hold out my hands, palms up. Then use a spatula. He would hold the flat end and hit my hands as hard as he can with the handle end.   


I had a hard time focusing, cause of ADHD. My father would give me assignments during summer vacation. Such assignments are like, memorize the capital cities of each country. Where each country is at in the world. Multiplication, division. Making me write everything in a book he highlighted and it was a lot.  It was hard. I just couldn't focus. He beat me if I didn't get it done or properly memorized. He will not stop until I was broken in spirit and refuse to get up.  


One time he spat in my face for not getting a chapter in a book written down on paper. The mucus was all over my face. When I went back to school new school year, math was getting harder. Words and literature was becoming advance. Cause of this I could not focus.  I was placed in special ed for this reason. I was bullied a lot too.  


I wanted to be normal. I wanted to be like the other kids. Have a normal life. I even begged my parents to put me on medication to help me... but they refused. Because of the abuse, and how empty I felt, and realizing I wasn't a normal kid at the age 11, I wanted to commit suicide. Some serious people got into this and I had to attend therapy and special classes to deal with this for awhile.   


Also my father is a Muslim, and around this time forced me to memorized things in the Quran. He'd tortured me, like placing a pencil between fingers and squeeze down on my hand. I can feel the finger bones around the pencil bending causing a great surge of pain. He'd do this if I get one thing wrong. What is worse, I did not speak Arabic.  So to me, I had to memorize gibberish.  


Age 12, we moved from New York City to Columbus, Ohio. There is a strong Islamic presence there and my father wanted to be around that. Shortly after the move, my mother who is a Chinese Buddhist converted to Islam. My father got her tapes that talked about the Quran in Chinese, so she can understand.   


I was failing at 5th grade, and I did my best, but it wasn't enough for my father ofc. I would hide my report cards and lied to them I lost it. I did not want to show him my failing grades. When he found them, oh I was in for a world of pain. He told my mother to get out of the apartment. She protested but demanded her and she relented. I forgot to mention my sister, she was 4-5 around that time. So my mother took her too with her.   


My father went to town on me. Tied me up with rope and tape. Gagged my mouth so I could not yell and started wailing at me with fists. He even picked me up and threw me across the living room a couple of times. Cause my legs and hands are bound, I was like dice getting tossed at a casino. I landed whatever side was facing the ground. He knocked my bottom left canine tooth out.  


Thankfully that was a baby tooth. A new one replaced it, and its longer than the others. A reminder where the tooth had broke.   


Another time I am not sure what I did, but I remember him tying me up and placing a knife to my throat. Threatening me to slaughter me like a lamb. He has put a knife to my throat so many times. Even now as a adult if my neck and throat is touched by someone, I wig out. I go from 0 to angry and scared when touched there.  


Still I got into trouble. Still I was a trouble maker.  


Age 15, my parents moved to Florida. In New Port Richie my uncle convinced my father and mother to moved there. Also the Islamic presence there is strong too. So it convinced my parents to move and try to make it work there.  


The beatings have almost stopped. Like literally almost stopped. My father worked long hours and only saw him at dinner before I did homework and went to bed. The first time I was able to focus in school better. I was much more well behaved. My self esteem shot through the roof. I made friends. The hot weather, I enjoyed it! My uncle took me almost every weekend fishing. He would even get me rental videos for VHS to watch. ((One video was a anime that show tits. Oh god my parents would have flipped if they saw that))   


I was a happy teenager!  
The higher taxes there  made my mother work too. Both my parents are too busy working. I was okay with this as I barely had to spend time with them when I got a loving uncle. I got to spend time with my friends. The only trouble I would get into was messing with fire ant hills as I love pissing those things off. I had awesome teachers at, Seven Springs Middle School. My grades shot up, as well as my mental and physical health was getting better and better. I was tan and lean and was a handsome young man. Everything was looking good for me.   


However, it was not to last. We did not stay even for a year. Because how my parents had to work like dogs, they decided to move back to miserable Columbus Ohio. My uncle gave my parents a massive roll of paper to use as packaging for the frail items like dishes and vases. This thing was heavy. I brought this up as this is important later.  


In the middle of cold autumn too. The sudden climate change screwed my body up. I got the chicken pox again. So literally I got the chicken pox twice! Once when I was a kid and then as a teenager.   


Cause of the school I had to go to, it was in the ghetto. I was bullied a lot. My father is less busy so the beatings came back. I was very miserable. Suicidal. Reckless. What even crazier, my father was a trucker. How he supported the family since I was 11. He take me in the truck on weekends and lecture me and  beat the crap out of me while I seated in the passenger seat.   


Then this day I will never forget. It's the day that changed me forever and I know it. Big story short, the day I got in trouble for climbing the open cafeteria windows to flirt with some girls eating lunch. When my father got home and heard the news... He loses it. Remember that big roll of paper? Well he took that and threw it on my head. I had to be rushed to the E.R and get 13 stitches. So much blood. I was concussed. Confused.   


My mother begged me to lie. So I did to the doctor saying a large china dish fell on my head as I was horsing around.

&amp;#x200B;

The beatings and punishment got worse and worse. My father would make me stand in the middle of the living room all night some days. If I fell asleep on the floor, he'd kick me on the sides like a dog. He prohibited me from moving that sometimes I would be asleep on the floor and I accidentally urinated on my myself. So I had to run to the bathroom to pee out the rest before I made a mess. I would then go back to standing in the middle of the living room in the dark until my body and mind is too tired.  


I couldn't take it anymore. I was cutting myself. Shop lifting. Stealing bikes. Causing trouble for the neighbors. Smoking. I was venting my frustration, my anger, and my sadness out by doing crimes. When I steal, I did not steal cheap stuff. I stole gameboys and games. I stole from stores, friends and so on. Each time I did it, I got better at it. I felt hollow inside once again and doing these things made me felt alive. I bury my head in games I stole to drown the world out. Make me forget my problems. My mental problems decline real fast too. I was spiraling out of control.  


I was bullied a lot at school, so as petty revenge some of the bullies played football. I would pretend to go home. Once most the students left I would return in different attire I had in my backpack. I would sneak into their locker rooms while they are at practice and my fingers got real sticky for their money. Most did not use locks on their lockers and I did this a handful of times. Cause of this, people wonder who the thief was and no one suspected it was me.  


I started to run away from home too. The frequency picked up on the runaways. If I had $100 for every time I runaway from home, I could afford a house or a super car by the time I was 18. I was caught a lot by police and they would send me though different children services. One place I visited more times I care to count was called the, Huckleberry House. A short term living place for troubled children and teens. It was like a short stop so children services can figure out what to do with the children.  


Another time I was caught I was sent into a mental ward for kids and teens. Where I was diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar. The medication help... but just barely.  


Then I did the biggest crimes in my life.... I wanted to go back to Florida. I wanted to feel safe and free again. I needed money though. So, one morning I skipped school, and went to a supermarket. I set fire in the car isle where I know all the flammable stuff was... My goal was to rob the registers as people left the store for safety, and use the money to get to Florida.   


I was caught.... Police took me home with a court date and everything as there was no substantial proof I did it. They had to look at evidence and footage.  My father was at work, and he threaten to kill me as soon as he got home. I tried running away again but my mother blocked the door. I never touched my mother, but in desperation I had to. I pulled and dragged her from the door and ran out.  


I was lost and confused and very scared for my life. Night settled, I was still determined to get to Florida. That is all on my mind. Get to Florida and be safe. I felt like I died inside. So night came, and I broke into a small collectibles store. Broke the door window with a log i found, I got in and took the register and got out quick. It was locked, so I took it to a feild and tossed it around and banged it with rocks till it opened. Nothing but change, but I took every penny, nickle, dime and quarter. Then I walked for an hour, and I went to Meijers when they started having those coin counters. I manage to get over 200 dollars. I tried shop lifting for supplies I needed on my trip but was caught.   


I was sent to Juvenile jail in the Franklin County District in Columbus. I was let out a few weeks later, given probation for a year with some community service. It was to school, work and back home. Still, I did things if I knew I can get away with it, to feel alive. Stealing. Smoking. That kind of stuff. My father got more violent with me and tried to drill Islam into my head even harder. He thinks that it should help me with my problems. Beatings and abuse still continued and I was powerless.  


Then the neighbors kids started to bully me. Beating me up and so on. On the last two weeks of my probation.... I made a Molotov cocktail. I was planning to threaten the bullies with it if they do not leave me alone. Well... they ran away to a cop that was rolling down the streets. Yep... busted. So I was given another year of probation and this time with an ankle monitor.  Because I was still causing trouble in school, and I was bullied and I am violating my probation time to time, my lawyer stepped in. I was about to go to Juvenile detention once again, instead she manage to get me into a place called the, Buckeye Ranch.   


A place for trouble kids to stay long term to see professionals for help and therapy. First day there, they cut the ankle monitor off. I stayed for about a year. There I learned to improve on my social skills and other things. I was taking my medication and making some strides. My behavior was improving. Because of the lack of abuse, I was happier. Not as happy as in Florida but never the less I felt safe and secure. I still caused trouble but, the stealing has stopped and I stopped smoking. I learn to grow plants, and take care of horses, and how to find a career.  


I let out my feelings a lot more. A lot of pent up rage and sadness was in me. Later, time to time I get to visit home on the weekends before I had to return.  


When I return I was 17, and my parents bought a house during my stay at the Buckeye Ranch. They promise not to hurt me anymore and things will be better. Boy was that a big lie.  


Again the beatings did return and my father had to use more force as I was a bigger guy by then. Also, I drew a lot. And in Islam, drawing people and animals is prohibited. My father would find my drawings and burn them in front of me. So much art I had was lost. So, I kept them hidden. In my room's vent. The vent grill was coming out the floor and was not bolted down. Do I hid my drawings... and some naughty material in there..... What? I was a young man still going through puberty! Sue me!  


My father had no idea. He would raid my room invading my private area randomly to search for things but never he looked in the vent. Then I would keep my drawings in a binder, in plastic sheets to protect them. I almost always leave that binder in my school locker.  


The house was in Hilliard, Ohio and I went to Darby High School. I realize I was also bisexual around this time. I met my first guy crush there and he liked me back. He given me a necklace of a arrow head and a wolf to show his fodness for me.. My father found this necklace and thought it was offensive to Islam and took it away from me. He later admitted he took it with him on his long haul drives in his truck and threw it out the window somewhere in Indiana. I was devastated. It pissed me off to no end. Another chip on my shoulder I will never forgive him for.  


I wanted to learn how to break dance, and I joined a club for that. My father did not approve and wanted me home on time. I defied his orders staying late at school to do activities. I wanted to do something with my life and in a more productive fashion! My stealing days was long behind me. Oh this did not set well with him.  


Surprisingly, the day I came out the closet he did not do anything to me. I think the shock was too much for my father to do anything. Instead he tried to talk to me about it. It felt awkward. Strange. To be honest. I was expecting to be buried alive. That was short lived as my father would call me a faggot and other demeaning names cause of my sexuality.   


I was a couple of months from my 18th birthday, and on this day was another event that turned me differently. I was practicing break dancing at school with my brothers (close friends at this point) and I called my mother to pick me up as usual. However my father was home early and she said he is coming to pick me up. I did not want to deal with my father because I know he will never approve of me staying after school and lecture me and smack me around. Instead I decided to walk home.   


When I got home I wanted to just go upstairs and be in my room. No as soon the door closes my father attacked me. He punched me to the floor and dragged me across the hallway into the living room by my hair. He started to wail at me with his fists. He beat me until he was out of breath. He sent me upstairs, no dinner and after crying for a good hour, I slept it off. Next morning I ran away from home.   


Another friend heard the news and told me he knows a family I can stay with a little bit until I turn 18. I took the chance. And for privacy I will say the husband is J and the mother is K. They had three children. Two twins and a young baby that was approaching toddler hood. They had a older daughter near my age we will name her R, who I thought was nice but was a bitch to me.  


I took care of the young kids as payment for my stay. Fed them. Babysit. Put them to bed. I had to be careful though as they had a head lice problem and I was letting my hair grow out. I would comb and take care of my hair and check for any signs of lice in my hair. I did get infected with head lice only once and because I caught it early I was able to treat it right away. I was that careful. J kept his hair short as possible, so he can spend time with his girls without worry. The day when I turned 18.... I was free from abuse....   


Oh I was so wrong on so many levels.  


Living with J and K for awhile... about 6-8 months. I found a guy I liked online that lived in Dayton, Ohio. I went to go live with him and he WAS AN A$$HOLE!... The f%$#er forced sex on me a lot! Even when I was sick as a dog with the flu, he forced me! What is worse... he got another guy and tried to have a three way. This new challenger was even a bigger asshole... but you know what they say about guys with small dicks beings an asshole? It is very true with this new guy. My thumb is bigger than his ""you know what!""  


One day I had enough. Boyfriend tried to force his way on me, and tried hitting me. I upper cut him in the solar plexus and told him ""No!"" which made him cry like a little girl as he heaves in pain. Then I dumped him there. When he realize I wasn't going anywhere and I will fight back, he moved out. Leaving me with small dingle dong man.

Also the Landlord was gay with a boyfriend and they were Zoophiles. I walked in one day on him and his boyfriend having sex with a dog! It's. Still. Burned. Into. My. Brain. To. This. Day. God. Help. Me.   


Also it was hard for me to land a job too. So I helped by looking after their dog and some other chores. Whatever... I needed a roof. One day the dog got loose when I went outside to do some yard work to earn my keep. The landlord came home and got furious. He started beating me up on the porch for everyone to see! Which later got him arrested.  


His boyfriend got arrested too for harassing the police.

  
His mother later came to kick me out. A friend was helping me pack my things. We told her what her son (the landlord) has been doing with animals and she refused to believe it. Oh well...   


I had a friend's mother come pick me up and take me back to Columbus, Ohio where I again lived with my parents. My father was sorry for everything and bought me new clothes and a cell phone. Because Social Media was becoming a thing around this time I had a lot of online friends. Two weeks living with my parents I was stupid to post my new number online and day and night I got texts. So 4 am I woke up to text chimes and I get up to go online to make a post to my friends not to text me on such and such hours.   


Then my dad walked in. I am on a computer.... 4 am.... doing nothing wrong.... Yet he lost it. He went from 0 to psycho very fast. He grabs the keyboard and pulls it away from me so hard the cable snapped before my eyes. Time seem to slow down for me there as I witness this keyboard cord just snaps in front of me.  


Then we had a shouting match. I realize... ""He is not trying to hit me. Oh yeah! I am 18!"" So I decided to shout back and we got into our first shouting match. He told me to get the F&amp;@% out and never come back or else he'll call the police. I packed up my things and left him, calling him all sorts of obscenities. It felt gooooood. I was in tears but it felt good at the same time.  


I stayed with a friend, until I manage to get a hold of some people I can stay with in Saint Louis, Missouri. They took me in, and lets just say.... their house.... should have been condemned as unlivable by the city ages ago. I am not joking. The basement floods, the house is falling apart. Bugs everywhere. Oh and they let a crazy cat lady live with them with dozens of cats and they were infested with fleas!   


Summer is approaching and I am close to the age of 19. Then I met this man who later becomes the love of my life I am still with today. We dated and he shown me kindness and love. Honestly I wasn't use to this. I thought he was trying to butter me up and let my guard down. Sometimes in my head I am like ""Okay what does he really want? There has to be something. This is not normal for this to happen to me."" But, trust came slowly and I learned to love.   


As for the situation I was in that time. I had a minimum paying job that barely covered my part of rent. I was behind. I need new shoes badly as I did not have a car or a bike. So everywhere I go was with my own two feet. When I bought new shoes and my own watch for the first time I earned with my money, she flipping lost it. I tried showing her my old shoes are falling apart. I had them for about 2 years give or take. No she wasn't having any of that. She kicked me out.  


Around this time I was having a infection grow under my right armpit. It was getting bigger and bigger each day and turning all sorts of shades of red, blue and purple.   


Also funny enough, the house I was kicked out of was **condemned by the city three months later and everyone in that place had to move out.** 

  
After I got kicked out. My boyfriend got me to stay with a friend who was cool. He was out in Saint Charles, Missouri. Few months later we got our own home. We live together and happily.  


However, my father would not let go of me in his clutches. My siblings would find me on social media and beg me to talk to him. I would cave and call and my father would try to guilt trip me into coming home. I would reject his offer and again would go from 0 to psycho that we have a shouting match over the phone. This would happen every two to three months as I tried my best to avoid talking to my family. Each time we talk, he would beckon me to come home and make many promises. When I reject he would mentally and verbally abuse me.  


Age 24, my father really hit me in the heart. We got into another fight when I refuse to come home when I am already home with a man I love and treats me well. He knows I like guys and he used that against me with homophobic talk. Calling me all sorts of homophobic names. He finished it off with ""I HOPE YOU GET AIDS AND DIE!""  


Next two days it really impacted me. I felt shattered. This would go on and on. I would talk to him trying to set boundaries but he kept crossing them.   


Also age 24 I got my first car. Even my father was critical, and verbally abusive. He told me I should have given him the money and he will find me a nice car. Now at this point in my life I knew something was amidst. He could have put the car under his name with mine and used it against me to come home. Nope. Not falling for it.  


Also I denounced being a Muslim as I want to follow my own path in spirituality. My father and mother do not know this. I know they will both flip out. I tend to keep them in the dark about this.    


Age 27, totaled said car in very bad and wet conditions. Got good insurance money out of it, and put it as a down payment for a Nissan 350Z. Again my father became critical saying I am too stupid to drive something that has so much horse power. Still have the Z to this day.  


**Also I was not being treated for my depression, and over the years I had no clue I was a ticking time bomb...**  


 About 3 years ago, I had a mental break down. My depression got suddenly worse. Depression can not only make one suicidal but also homicidal too. That is what happen to me. I was terrified as I felt extremely suicidal and homicidal. It was not for attention. I felt it like the way I was starving for food or thirsty for water. I wanted to. The urges were powerful. I realize something is very wrong with me. I ask my spouse to hide my handgun. He did at his company he owned. Locked and hidden.  


Also his company is protected by fencing and cameras and alarms. So I know there is no way I can find them in case I become more of a basket case.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it was a phase and I tried to wade it out for 4 days. When I realize I wasn't going to win, I turn myself into the E.R and got into a mental ward. I felt shattered, broken, as if my true kind self is going to fade into the abyss forever.  


The next 7 days they concluded I suffered PTSD, major depression and possibly boarderline personality disorder from my past of being abused badly. I was evaluated by 4 psychiatrist. A leader and three students. You know its bad when a psychiatrist (The leader) says ""Because of your past Mr. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*, its not surprising you feel homicidal."" I was taken back by this. Took me a moment to accept that... yeah it is possible I was feeling this way because of all the harsh abuse I've been through.   


Also it did not help I turned myself in at the start of OCTOBER and people were watching HORROR FILMS with blood and people stabbing other people at that ward.  


After I got out, I started to see a psychiatrist and take therapy for my BPD. I am taking a a pill to help with my symptoms and I am back to normal... mostly. Still get the urges to maim someone or jump off a building but its very much controllable.   


Then my father called, and we get into yet another fight... I had it with him trying to guilt trip me home. When he got angry that I refuse to come home I stopped him. ""I know why you are pissed I wouldn't come home! I left you like your father did!"" And hung up the phone.  


I mean it is true. His father bailed out on him shortly after he was born.   


And here is the crazy part. Someone pinch me to make sure I am not dreaming. After that when we talked, he started to respect my boundaries and became more understanding. We do not fight any longer. I told him what I told you reader about my mental breakdown and he feels fully responsible for it. He even brought up Florida. He mentioned he noticed my sister and I were very happy to be there. We were healthier and flourishing. He mention regretting moving from there.   


Reader, to me this is very strange. I am not sure if its old age or something with my old man. I am 32 and going to be 33 this summer. There is a little peace and a hint of solace in knowing my father realizes the damage he has done to me. Still, somethings he did I can never forgive him for. I know I given him WAY more chances he deserves. I still do not trust him at all, and I am keeping very cautious. I do however have slight optimism that he maybe changing just a little for the better.  


Ah reader, my journey has been hell, but I am happy. Still with the man I fell in love with when I was 19. I have my own car, and trying to open my own small business thanks to the enormous help from my spouse.   


To be honest, I want to cut all connections to my father. I want nothing to do with him anymore.

b9hzis,My abusive ex is back in town,"I live in a rural area and just learned through the grapevine that my abusive ex is back in town for the summer. I’m afraid of running into him because I don’t know how I’ll react. I might get angry, cry, or worst of all, freeze up and do nothing, just pretend like things are fine when really he screwed my life up so badly. Part of me wants to never see him again and part of me wants very badly to confront him about how he treated me, since I took all of his abuse in silence. Complicating things is the fact that my current boyfriend says he wants to beat up my ex, which only stresses me out more. I want to deal with my own problems not have someone fight on my behalf, and I want to be able to confront him myself if the opportunity came up. Until then I feel like I have to be looking over my shoulder all the time now.

b9js0y,I was strangled by my brother as a child but am not sure if it was simply sibling rivalry,"I have posted this on r/relationships but didn't get a lot of replies, so though maybe this sub might be helpful, sorry if it's not.

Before I say more I personally have never truly thought I was abused or was a victim in anyway, and I would never compared what happened between my brother and I to the other stories I've heard and would never think of them on the same level as those abuse stories.

As a child, like most siblings, my brother would beat up on me since I was younger, but it got to the point that it was more than just arguments and hitting, it would often turn to being strangled. To me I've never heard of other people telling me their siblings would strangle them, so it has made me question whether that's the line of abuse or if I'm being over dramatic and was just dealing with sibling rivalry on a more intense level. I don't consider myself a victim or anything and I'm not looking for pity, just an opinion from an outside viewpoint. 

TL;dr: My brother and I fought as kids do, but I would often be strangled by him in fights, was this abuse or just more intense sibling rivalry? I don't think of it as a abuse or that in a victim, just wanting to see an outside point of view.",throwthisaway2w,2019-04-04 16:13:04,1,252,18.82,15.1,78.79,1,31.5,17.46,93.65,66.27,18.65,11.51,9.92,0,0,0.4,1.19,7.14,5.95,14.68,13.1,7.14,11.11,3.97,20.24,6.75,6.35,0.79,0,2.38,6.35,1.19,5.16,0,3.17,0.79,11.9,3.57,0,0,1.98,19.44,1.98,0.79,3.97,6.75,2.38,8.33,2.38,1.19,1.19,0,0.4,0,0.4,0,0,9.13,4.37,0.4,3.97,0.79,0,6.35,8.73,0.4,9.92,0.4,5.95,3.57,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,0.79,0,0.4,0,0,0.4,12.3,2.38,4.76,0.4,0.4,0.4,0,0,0,3.57,0,0.4

crossposted from /offmychest, deleted it there cause it looked like it had been deleted? not sure why or how

&amp;#x200B;

It's been nearly three years since I dated this girl for only around a month. My memories from this time are so muddy, but I felt like I had known her forever within a really short time. We would talk like non-stop every day. I knew a lot about her past, and she knew about mine including my eating disorder. It wasn't long before she would make comments on my weight, making comments about being unsatisfied with my body, asking me frequently about the gym, and worst, telling me just from looking through old social media photos that she couldnt decide which she liked better, ""skinny"" me (struggling with anorexia) or the current me. She also made a lot of ""jokes"" about insecurities she was aware of.

The relationship also became sexual really quickly. We were both pretty young (I don't feel comfortable disclosing, but same age and of legal age) but she had more experience than I did. She was into kinky stuff and at the time I was too but again, without much experience. We kind of went straight into that kind of thing without much prior discussion of how it would play out. It's hard for me to go into much detail here but I will say that on at least one occasion I remember feeling extremely frozen and frightened, almost unable to speak, and saying ""please stop"" ( i still don't know if she heard/understood me ). In a panic i said ""safe word!"" which was not something that we had or ever discussed. I still have bad dreams about that time, which is difficult and confusing because it was something I consented to. 

On top of that, she often asked over and over in a short time about doing things I'd stated I wasn't comfortable with. Before our first time getting physical, I'd told her I didn't want to do something. She joked (?) that I'd ""change my mind"". I did end up changing my mind and this was something she then brought up in the same joking tone whenever I was uncomfortable with something else. She was reluctant to use protection and on occasion tried to remove it without asking me.

She wanted me to agree to plans to move in with her in a year and a bit when she moved. I lived at home and told her I really wasn't ready to change that or make that commitment. As a result, she told me that my parents were horrible and abusive. I was having issues with my parents at the time, but she seemed very much against me working on my relationship with them.

Despite all this, I believed that I loved her. I feel very stupid for this because I didn't even know her. However I truly believed that we needed each other. She seemed to offer a solution to all my problems and told me she needed me too, that no one would love her like I did. It seemed so high stakes, and when she was affectionate I felt that I had won the lottery. I stayed despite pretty much crying every day and even begged her not to leave me when she eventually decided to.

I wish that had been the end, but for the rest of the year we tried to be friends, and still had a fairly codependent friendship, and she would still do shitty things like sending me my own nudes lmao. when i started to recognize her behavior as manipulative, I wanted to reconcile this with our friendship by trying to get her to acknowledge the harm she had done. However, I never really got a sincere apology for everything, mostly just a lot of self-deprecation. When I became more direct and told her how badly she had hurt me, she basically told me that I had convinced myself of everything and it hadn't really happened that way, and got pretty angry.

&amp;#x200B;

all this within such a short time. it seems impossible right? my being ok with all this seems like the behavior of someone who'd been groomed/manipulated for a long time. her behavior fits the profile of an emotional manipulator/abuser but i can't help but be angry at myself and confused that she managed to ""pull this off"" in such a short time. i am also confused and frustrated that it still hurts me today. im doing so much better , i love myself a lot more and im in a healthy, loving relationship but i swear i think about this at least once a day and cant help but ask what i'm doing wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

WAYYYY tl;dr: Memories of a girlfriend I dated for a very short time are still on my mind years later, and her emotional manipulation has left scars that confuse and frustrate me. I just want to forget it.

b9zap2,Anyone else ever experience horrible parents?,"Long story short. I was 11, and my mom had this ‘friend’. A ‘friend’ she slept with. He was 52 years old. She let this guy walk around naked in our house with his junk flopping all over the place; in front of her two young daughters. 
One night, this ‘friend’ and I were sitting down watching TV while he played hearts on his laptop, in his robe as usual. He asked me if I wanted to learn how to play, I said sure! He’s teaching me how the game works and then he pulls his dick out and lays it on the computer. I tried to ignore it, being 11 and not knowing what the hell to do. He then started rubbing himself and I just got up to go to my room. He immediately asked if it made me uncomfortable and I said yeah. He apologized and somehow managed to convince me to sit back down on the couch with him. Most uncomfortable 2 hours of my life. 
Fast forward to age 19. My moms talking about her ‘friend’ with a smile on her face; and I asked her to not talk about him, politely. She pressed and pressed for a reason why so i told her. She immediately went into defense mode and asked why I was making this up, ‘is it for attention?’.  Said she didn’t believe me because I would of told her when I was younger, etc. 
We fight and go our separate ways. She instantly calls my older sister to tell her how crazy I am and my sister told her how she had sexual relations with him when she was 15. I was 11 when she was 15.

Three years ago I met my partner. I will not say their gender for not wanting to identify them, so I will refer to my partner with ""them/they"". Let's call this person Alex.

At the beginning, I was messing around in a dating app, not looking for anything serious, when I came accross this person's profile. Alex had some psychedelic references on their profile, and at the time I was in a drug phase, so this made Alex seem somewhat interesting to me. 

We got together what ensued came to put into question my drug usage until then. Until then, I had used drugs to go out and have fun with friends or to introspect a little bit. The thing, is that Alex was a die hard fan of Freud and Jong, and believed that drugs could dwelve onto the subconscious if you dug hard enough. 

As Alex and I fell hard into a psychedelic drug use (LSD, psylocibin, LOTS of MDMA), Alex started getting weird about what theyd talk about while on drugs. They'd ask me the most personal questions, trying to dig way past normal barriers that I would put up, even the ones I usually keep when dating people for a few months. They thought it'd be interesting to fiddle around with childhood memories, asking me super personal things about my parents, making me ask myself if I was to be worried about having [insert DSM chapter here]. 


I started questioning Alex's sanity, for I realized we both clearly were not on the same boat when it came to what was real, or not, about our life stories or the world around us. This is when things got ugly - Alex started getting violent. 


The first time I got slapped, which was the first time I was ever slapped by anyone other than my mother ONCE in my life, I was so shocked I didn't react right away. When I eventually did react, I told them that this was not acceptable and that it could never happen again. Alex told me that the tone I had used has caused them great frustration and that slap was the byproduct of this. 

The slaps came together once every few weeks at the beginning, and then got more common, eventually followed by horrible insults (pig, retard, crazy whore). 

Besides this, Alex had grown so, so jealous of all my friends. First, they made me cut off all male friends, then 90% of my female friends, because I am bisexual and they believed everyone to be a threat. Eventually, I had to cut off my FATHER because Alex believed my father was a ""threat"" to them and didn't like them, so I shouldn't talk to my father. 

Finally, Alex did not allow me to work or go to school, as neither did they. As an A student who had never stopped working since age 16, this felt so weird to not do anything of my day except maybe try to program in the computer, since Alex wanted me to help them to build an application that, 'trust me', they'd say, 'we'll be rich!' 

All of this, was done thorugh so much putting down, making me doubt myself, gas lighting, yelling, intimidating. I slowly disassociated from who I was.  I lost my voice, I would cry, I would sometimes turn around and see them sleep and wonder if I could just run the fuck out the door. But I didn't. Not for long. 

Alex's mother and her new husband saw Alex hit me and insult me multiple times, including in moments when we were all in the same car. As I tried to leave the car one time, Alex's mother begged me to stay, saying that ""couples have little arguments like this"". 

A night came when we got in a really bad fight, and Alex started cutting themselves with scissors. I tried to stop this, and by doing so, Alex cut part of my skin on my hand open with the scissors. Under the adrenaline of the moment, I didnt realize the wound was deep. I still have the scar on my hand from this.

The morning after this is when I decided to leave, and I made the mistake of telling them I would be doing so. Alex got really mad and choked me against the wall, and I managed to escape. I left the appartment and never came back. Our relationship lasted a total of one year, but it felt like a lifetime. 


It's now been two years since this happened, and although I'm back in shape with the rest of my life (got my friends back, just got accepted into uni, am working, am mostly happy), I have times where I'm taken back to that year I spent with Alex. 

Today, I found out that my ex partner had made a name for themselves - apparently they and their new partner had lived in an appartment where they trashed the whole place, stole goods and basically had to get kicked out by the police.  (this was shared in an appartments for rent group and a friend of mine told me she saw my ex's name on a post, and had clicked on the tag and it was indeed their FB profile). 

Finding that out is the first time that my experience with this crazy unstable person is validated, specially since this person had spent so much time telling me that whatever I was going through was all in my head.  This took me back a little bit and made me realize how far I've come, but also how I need to talk to someone about this.

ba6f4r,Help for a supporter,"I recently (35m her 26f)found out my 8 month long girlfriend was a subject of abuse. It's quite sordid and I don't want to discuss the details, but the abuser was someone we both know did some very bad things and the police bungled the investigation. 

I've been very supportive, giving a bit of advice but foremost supporting what she feels she needs to do. 

It's been a bit of a rough last 3 months. 

I got some advice about trying to bring normalcy to the situation, but it's been very hard. I've had ptsd before and I know the signs of trauma, the interviews she and me both had with detectives really took their toll. 

I'm finding it difficult in some moments. Yesterday, we had a lovely afternoon and evening together, and then she brought me to a place where we could be intimate (but it's family owned and I didn't know how to react). She stormed off saying didn't you see how I was dressed for you, why didn't you kiss me, it was a huge fiasco. I was caressing her intimately when we were there, but she wasn't responding. I'm confused about non response versus expectations, i mean of course I want to support her and of course I desire her, how does one deal with that?

baaw0q,applying to publix tomorrow. we have to get out before it get's physical.,"i have severe anxiety, but i have to put my feelings on the back burner and do this even if i'm panicking all the way through.  he's leaving me no choice. i'll start with how this all started in his mind. last week me and my mom went to west palm to visit friends, she has a new job (walmart) and we kept this to ourselves. my father has my mother cut off from any money he makes, she's using her money for everything. my brother has been ignoring him, as have i. you ask a question, i'll answer, but i will not entertain your drunk anger. this has been gnawing  at my fathers mind like maggots to a dead rat. *he's loosing control.* and getting sicker in the head. so, he decided to come in my room while i was in the bathroom and my mom was in our bed. we share a bed bc she's afraid of him raping her, (again.) i hear this and rush to my room as he closes the door and i step in wearing a bathing suit. i figure it's a great way for him to make a sexual remark at me, but i don't give a shit. i step in to hear him sitting down drilling my mom on why she didn't tell him about the trip, or getting a new job. ""were a team, i tell you fucking everything. this is supposed to be a marriage, your sisters right about you being a loser. you were the worst thing that ever happened to me. you steal my money, your'e a thief and a liar."" a couple snip-its of the shitty things he was saying. she told him to fuck off and leave my room, and get a lawyer. he replies with threats, like, oh, you aren't going to see any of my money, i'm canceling your car insurance so you get fucked. i'm hiding everything. keep in mind he's ass blasted drunk.  this video is our response. (i'm the girl voice, my brother is the male) i didn't get any of his threats on video but i got this. it's nothing considering it just us yelling at him, but he fucking deserves it. after the years of trauma that man has inflicted on us, he deserves to know his kids fucking hate him. me and my brother are getting jobs asap and leaving with my mom.

babj0l,What do I call this?,"Hi, I was in a abusive relationship that lasted two years and ended recently. It was a very weird situation. Things were bad before he moved in with me, but once we started living together that’s when I realized things were fucked. Anyway, he was definitely emotionally abusive and borderline physical. But also, while we were together he’d pressure me into sexual acts. I didn’t want to have sex, but he did and he used every tactic he could to say yes. It got to a point where it was too tiresome to fight it anymore and I’d give in and say yes because I knew it would just cause more problems if I didn’t. I rarely was able to orgasm, and more often or not I was just left frustrated and sad afterwards, to the point of crying (and at worse panic attacks). Basically, was this sexual abuse?

These were some of his behaviours, some are in the present tense as they are copied from notes I made for myself along the way so I could keep track of his behaviour:

- Gets extremely jealous and upset if I pay attention to anyone else - claims I love to be the centre of attention. 
- Shouting at me loudly in general
- Gets very angry if I don't take his word for gospel and want to find out my own information.
- Continues to do things that scare me - like tailgating on highways, speeding, skidding car on ice and snow, raising his voice when I've said I have PTSD from childhood abuse.
- Won't give me my own space: 
* Used to knock on the toilet door if I spent too long in it
* Used to want to take every shower and bath with me
* Still wants to know where I am at all times 
* Still spies on me on my phone when I'm out - looks at WhatsApp to see if I'm online
* Still expects me to be available to him constantly
* Expects INSTANT responses to texts
- Has little emotional regulation without weed 
- Tells me how I feel and how I WOULD act if I TRULY felt that way - eg I 'wouldn't use social media if I was truly depressed'
- Tells me 'I don't want my future wife to do this and that' as a way to make me change my behaviour.
- If I'm depressed and in bed he HAS to stay in bed right next to me all day and act as though I've made him depressed. If I cry I can't cry alone, he has to know why that moment.
- Has started to demand sex and get angry and grumpy if I don't give it to him
- Will go out of his way to research something to prove me wrong even if he doesn't care about it. Common for him to bring up a comment I made two hours later as he's been researching in the meantime to disprove it.
- The cuddle - I hugged a male friend and he told me I had basically cheated on him and broken his trust and said 'everyone thought your actions were innapropriate' but when I asked someone that was there (who didn't think my actions innapropriate) and told him, he said their opinion didn't matter and that I shouldn't have to seek validation from others.
- New Years Eve - split up with me and demanded I book a ticket that moment and he drive me to airport. When I said no I'll get a hotel and go on my own terms he changed his tune as he couldn't control how I left so wanted me to stay. Then sent me text messages whilst in the same room as me (at his family's house, with them in the room!) asking me if we could still have casual sex. When I said no, he asked why I wouldn't have sex with him as I had with dozens of men before and I was trashy and a slut.
- If we were ever in hotels I wasn't to leave the hotel room on my own 'or he'd be worried about me'. He once yelled at me until I cried because I went down to the lobby to get him a coffee whilst he was in the shower.
- Used to constantly tell me stories about ex gfs and girls he's dated when we first got together and told me his best friend once said she was in love with him - attempt to trigger insecurity in me?
- Almost everything I do is wrong - Will slam the toilet lid down in front of me if I forget to put it down. I drain vegetables wrong, I put things into containers wrongs, I use too many utensils when I cook, I load the dishwasher wrong.
- Acted like I was vain and strange and said I am 'not who he thought I was' when I wanted to occasionally put on makeup on as I didn't/don't wear it often
- Withholds affection when I 'displease him'.
- Expects me to have sex with him almost every day, if I ever don't want to have sex because I'm not in the mood I'm told 'people who love someone would want to do anything to make them feel good'. Insinuating I don't love him.
- Said I was asking for attention by making eye contact and was 'falling over myself impressed' by men on motorbikes... that beeped at me and scared me so I laughed at how much it made me jump.
- Would talk at me in circular conversations for hours, especially at night to make me anxious before bed or keep me up into the early morning when I had to be up for work.
- Said he was suicidal when I broke up with him.



I think we could all agree he was abusive, but my question is this: HOW do I seperate where his abusive behaviour ended and my failings begin?

Example: He says my not wanting to have sex with him was me withholding to be abusive! But actually I just didn't feel like it because I was so stressed and depressed from his unrelenting behaviour... but is that just us both seeing it differently?

Example 2: He was VERY anxious and needy and I'm quite secure/avoidant, he said I was the one MAKING him like that because I didn't need the affection he did or time together. I said no your neediness and the resulting behaviour (above) is just plain unhealthy... was that a failure on my part to not be sympathetic enough?

Example 3: Should I have not hugged/cuddled a male friend if it was outside of his boundaries or is he creating unrealistic and overly-posessive boundaries?

Example 4: At times I would have to leave the conversation and walk out of the room and get flustered and upset. From my perspective it was because he would go on and on and on and on and on forever saying I'm cold and heartless and have no regard for his feelings and if I did I would make changes. From his perspective he would say abusers walk out of rooms and don't finish conversations or come to agreements/conclusions.


I just feel like my reality... has been distorted. I'm not sure of anything at the moment but I'm also a fair person and I self-critique so I wanted to know if you perceive me to have also done anything wrong here??

badw42,I don’t know if I’m abusive or if it’s him,"I’ve been with my bf since I was 19. He has lied for years saying he is going to make it big and release his app. I full heartedly supported him. Blind faith. I was homeless when we started dating and had came from a very abusive home and was recently abandoned. It sounded like a dream and it was me and him against the world. 

Well, he just continues to work on a project that I’ve never seen. Refuses to work a job besides ubering for maybe several hours a week while I work 40 hours. 

I think his family gives him all his money and I’m never allowed to know how much he has. 

Now he’s 36 and I’m 27. He hasn’t had a job since we’ve been together and won’t apply to anything. Whilst I’ve taken whatever gig to help us sustain. Were vegan but he won’t touch meat. So that takes a huge chunk of jobs away. Cashier, food prep so on and so forth. 

I’ve worked in service where I had to prepare meat because we needed money. 
I’ve had to work in gross environments because we’ve needed money. 
I’ve had to put my self in suggestive positions because we needed money. 

He has not left his comfort zone for money. Whilst I’m in debt and have had to do anything to get by. I’m in debt on the books and he is in debt w his family 2 separate things in my book. 

Back in November my dog was dying. I was begging him to help me get in in to my car to see the vet. He refused. Said the dog was fine. The dog had stopped eating and drinking and was in visible pain. 

I finally get the dog to the vet. Dog has lung cancer and lunges are filled with fluid and he is drowning from the inside out.  

Basically the only option is to put him down. 

My bf is adamant we do not do that and it is inhumane.  Wants to take him home so he can die at our house and we can burry a 120 pound dog in the back yard. 

I fight him tooth and nail. He’s not willing to pay to have his lunges drained (maybe give him a day to weeks to live ) or put him down. I’m the one paying I’m the one who makes the decision. 

Tells me I’m killing his best friend then leaves me alone to be with him while he dies. 
I call him before the procedure to give him the opportunity to be there, he takes it. 

I’m so fucking destroyed after this. I feel like I let my dog down for being a ducking wreck. I feel so disgusted in my bf while he feels he got to maintain his morals. I’m just so ducked up over all of it still. 
Anyways the week before my dog had died he was in Japan at a “job interview” aka a free vacation paid for his grandparents. 

My battery in my car was dead and I would have to jump it every time to start it. My money was all spent on my dogs er visit. My bf was already planning his next Japan trip whilst knowing I was tapped and my car was broken. 
So I made a friend with this guy. He replaced my battery and I made out with him. He turned out to be a psycho and started stalking me threatening to kill me. 

My boyfriend is pissed. Which I understand why. But at the time I just felt like no one cared about me and to have a man fix my car and pay for it just felt fucking amazing. 

So dog dies middle of November. Boyfriend was in Japan for first week of November and leaves again for Japan last week of November. 

Says he has a job interview. It was all a lie. I knew it was when I asked him to show me any email or phone call or text he became psychotic. 

Anyways he comes back after a 6 week stay in Japan. Sometime in January. He apologized and basically the whole time he was in Japan I said I’m leaving him, he said he’d kill him self if I did or he found out that I moved out. So I didn’t. 

When he got home I confronted him about it and he said it was all in my head. I wanted to faint and die when he said that. 

He keeps saying his app will be done tomorrow then the next day. 

I just told him please don’t fucking lie to my face. I’m already stupid enough to believe you to this point and you don’t have the dignity to tell your partner the truth. And just how I dint want to be with him but I’m financially strapped because of him and in debt and can not afford anything on my own. I’m basically his prisoner. 

He’s fine with all of it, me being beholden. 

Like right now he is so fucking pissed I saved up money for my other dogs surgery. 

“You saved up for a surgery that hasn’t even happened yet and I could have used the money.” 

The surgery is Tuesday and it took 2 paychecks and over time specifically to make this happen to save my dog. 

What in the fuck. 

Sorry. Idk what to say or how to explain all of it. I feel fucking worthless.",eggs4change,2019-04-07 00:14:27,12,933,24.88,54.69,47.19,10.77,12.44,11.79,92.28,60.88,21.76,17.79,9.22,0.96,0.43,7.18,0,3.97,4.61,13.72,11.25,5.79,8.25,1.71,20.69,2.89,1.18,1.5,1.29,1.29,4.5,1.61,2.79,0.11,2.04,0.43,13.93,0.32,1.07,0,8.15,9.11,1.82,1.82,1.29,1.82,1.29,2.36,2.57,0.54,1.18,0.86,2.68,0.64,0.86,0.64,0.54,6.97,2.57,0.96,2.47,1.39,0.21,8.15,11.79,1.18,15.65,2.36,6.75,6.97,2.25,0.86,0.75,2.25,0.21,1.18,2.04,0.86,0.75,0,0.21,0.32,12.86,7.93,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,3.75,0.21,0
baejy5,Breaking down and really need some advice (Long Post),"I'm having a really difficult time and I feel like I need to vent and talk about my experience, and hopefully get some advice. I'm going to do my best not to be too graphic, but \*Trigger Warning\* nonetheless.

So, I'm a 26 year old man, and at 21, I got into my first and so far, only romantic relationship with my now ex-girlfriend. After becoming physically intimate for the first time in my life, walls seemed to start falling away in my mind, and childhood memories started rushing back to me. It started out as just feelings. Anything sexual would send me into these un-explainable fits of panic. And if that didn't happen and we were actually able to be intimate, I would feel this overwhelming sense of guilt and disgust at myself. After some time, I started getting more than just weird feelings, and I could actually see bits of a memory in my mind. I realized that when I was probably around 6-8ish, I was with my Mom at her friends house. Her friend had a daughter who was probably around 15 or 16. I remember being in her bedroom alone with her while our moms talked in the living room. She made me get into bed with her and made me take my clothes off. She told me that if I said anything, that I would get in trouble. I don't remember what happened next. I only remember eventually leaving the room and being terrified that my Mom would find out.  


After having this revelation, I decided to talk to my mom. I told her that I think I might have been sexually abused. I didn't tell her the specifics at that point, but that's when she told that she had hoped I wouldn't remember. She then proceeded to explain how when she was trying to potty train me, that I would freak out and scream and was desperately afraid of going into a bathroom, and that it was later discovered that a male friend of my babysitter had been taking myself, as well as other children into the bathroom and abusing us, and that he was actually caught and prosecuted, and is probably still in prison to this day.  


After some more time passed, I was eventually able to recall yet another instance of abuse at the hands of an older boy that was the son of another of my moms friends. This one was ongoing for probably about a year, and is the one that I now have the most complete recollection of.

&amp;#x200B;

I really struggled to cope with these things and I would have sudden panic attacks all the time. Between that and my near inability to be sexually intimate, there was a huge strain placed on my relationship with my girlfriend. That combined with some other unrelated issues, lead to us breaking up. After being single for a few months, the panic attacks and such seemed to gradually go away. Its been nearly a year and a half since I had any kind of anxiety attack, or even gave much thought to my abuse. I've been good at bottling stuff up and burying it.

&amp;#x200B;

So a few days ago, all of a sudden, it all just rushed back and hit me like a train. I've started having panic attacks again. I've been unable to sleep. I'm super irritable. My chest just feels tight and my head feels like its made of lead or something. And I keep finding myself just spacing out. Like I'm not even here or something. Its all worse than what it was before. Its affecting me at work and people must be able to tell that somethings wrong, because everyone keeps asking me if I'm okay, but I don't really want to talk about it. My co-workers are actually my best friends. I'm a Deputy at a county jail, and my shift is like my second family. But I'm terrified that if I tell them whats going on, that they'll look at me and treat me differently. I feel like I'm coming unglued. I don't know what to do or how to cope with this. I've talked to 3 different therapists before and I guess it didn't really help. Part of me feels like I'm completely over-reacting. Like I should just suck it up or something, since its all in the past anyway, and its far and away from the worst thing that ever happened to someone. I just don't know. Any advice at all would be hugely appreciated. Thank you in advance, and sorry this post was so long. I don't really have anyone to vent to, so I guess this all just kind of poured out of me once I picked up the keyboard.",Vinderwake,2019-04-07 02:20:11,4,812,25.78,21.16,95.26,1.95,16.57,14.78,94.83,62.32,21.67,13.67,11.08,0.49,0.12,1.72,0.25,8,3.82,15.02,10.22,7.51,8.13,1.35,19.33,4.93,3.69,1.11,1.72,3.08,5.79,1.48,4.31,1.72,1.11,0.37,8.37,0.99,0.86,2.34,0.62,16.87,4.06,1.72,2.46,5.05,1.6,4.31,2.09,0.37,0.25,1.23,1.48,0.62,0.49,0.37,0,7.02,1.85,1.72,2.34,1.35,0.74,7.27,9.36,1.23,15.76,1.85,7.27,6.65,0.62,0.37,0.99,0,0,0,0.62,0.25,0,0.12,0.12,0.12,15.76,5.91,4.43,0,0.49,0,0,0.62,0,3.08,0.25,0.99
baht2o,Secondhand abuse? Unintended abusive consequences?,"This is a weird question, and I'm sorry if it doesn't make much sense. I'm not sure how to phrase it. Is there a term for the abusive effects someone's actions have on another person? 

My mother is schizophrenic, doesn't admit her issues and refuses to seek medical attention. She started seeing a man about 5 years ago, which was amazing to me, because she had been divorced, extremely mentally unstable, and single for 15 years at that point. The guy is wonderful. He's the one person who can communicate with my mother and who actively keeps her out of those dark places she gets sucked into. Honestly I wish I got to grow up with him. 

However, he has severe anxiety disorder, and isn't capable of obtaining medication to help him. As a result, he drinks. Not every day, not every week, but when his anxiety gets so bad (maybe once a month) it's unbearable, he waits until right before 2am (alcohol stops being sold after that time), so he has no way of going back to get more, and gets 2 or 3 big beer bottles. He used to be a severe alcoholic, and gave it up for the most part, so now his tolerance is extremely low, and when he has a few beers he gets incoherent/stumbling around drunk. He's never aggressive, mean, or physical in any way. 

Well, unfortunately if he drinks enough he'll piss himself. This happened today, and on my blanket and mattress (small floor mattress as I'm temporarily staying with my mom). As a result, I came back from an exhausting overnight shift, unable to sleep anywhere, and with my asthma and allergies spiking up like a motherfucker. They have a cat, and the only place she doesn't go is near my blanket and mattress so that's literally my only safe space. 

So now, I'm fucking exhausted, I have no place to sleep, I can't fucking breathe, I'm wheezing, and I'm miserable. I know he didn't mean to cause any of this, but it's not the first time and it's crossing the line. I'm leaving as soon as I could, but it got me thinking. Is there a term for these sort of indirect yes extremely negative effects on someone as a result of someone else's self-abuse/neglect?

Sorry for the long post. Id love it hear what you guys think of this. Also, I'm okay otherwise! I promise! It's just the physical effects this sometimes has on me...",moistwaffles420,2019-04-07 09:08:02,0,423,22.68,37.91,59.6,1.95,15.11,18.91,93.62,56.26,18.44,12.06,6.38,0,0.24,5.2,0.24,6.38,5.2,12.06,10.17,6.86,9.93,3.31,17.73,6.38,2.6,1.65,1.89,2.6,8.04,2.6,5.44,0.71,2.13,1.18,11.35,0.95,0.47,2.13,4.73,13.95,2.84,2.84,0.95,4.02,1.89,3.78,1.18,0.47,0.47,0,5.67,0.95,2.84,0.47,1.65,5.91,0.71,0.95,1.89,1.89,0.95,3.31,13,0.95,15.6,1.89,7.33,6.86,0,1.65,0.71,0.24,0,0,1.89,1.18,0,0.47,0.24,0,22.7,5.67,7.8,0,0,0.95,0.47,0.24,0,5.67,1.42,0.47
bai87m,I feel damaged,"Few people know about this aside from my husband. This isn't something I want to remember. But it plays back in my head almost every night, and maybe shouting it out to the ether will somehow give some kind of release and those nightmares will stop. I'm writing this in the middle of the night and I can't sleep. Don't know if I'll submit this or delete it once I've written this. Who knows.  


It started when I was around 7 years old. When I was ""of age"", apparently. I never knew my mother. The story I was given was that she never wanted me. So my father give her a lump sum of ""fuck off"" money and she split with a former boyfriend. Who knows where she is right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Buried in the woods, I can only hope.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. 7 years old. I've never liked thunderstorms. They've always scared the devil out of me. I remember it being really bad that night. The tree in my neighbours garden fell and totalled the greenhouse just outside of my bedroom window. I didn't want to stay in there in case another tree ended up in my bedroom, so I grabbed my teddy and ran into my father's bedroom to sleep in his bed where I thought it was safe. He'd been drinking heavily that day. He always did the day he got paid. He was a lawyer, but he drank like a bum. But I didn't really think about it. All I was thinking was ""daddy will keep me safe'.  


When I got into bed with him he was awake. I can't remember a lot of what he whispered to me.Some of it was nonsensical. But I remember distinctly how he kept telling me he would ""take my mind off of the storm"". And if I closed my eyes really tightly, I'd soon forget about all of it. I won't go into details. I can't because I think if I try I'll throw up. But he did something no father should ever do. Whether he was so drunk that he forgot how old I was...that I was even his daughter at that point...I couldn't give a fuck. I just remember being more scared than I have ever been in my life. And the pain. I couldn't understand if my daddy loved me so much, how he could hurt my like that. I wasn't old enough to understand what was really going on, but I knew it was very wrong.  And I couldn't make a sound. I couldn't scream. I couldn't try and fight him off. I couldn't move. And when he was done and he rolled over and fell asleep like nothing had happened, I just cried and cried until I fell asleep.   


That was the first time my father ever hurt me like that, and the last time I ever remember feeling completely safe.  


Ever since I managed to get away from my ""family"" home five years of trauma later, I haven't been able to get away from it. Never been able to trust another person fully.

bakb3y,Girlfriend Keeps Playing Abuse Olympics,"I’m having trouble discussing the topic of abuse with my girlfriend. We both come from different backgrounds, and we both experience(d) different kinds of abuse.

I come from an upper middle class background. My background had the “perfect little family” facade, which hid the unresolved anger and anxiety issues of my well meaning mom. Those issues led to terrifying temper tantrums, verbal abuse, and emotional manipulation, and if she got involved in our lives it could do more harm than good, especially with my disability, where she had a significant amount of control over me growing up. While she reflected some aspects of narcissism, her behavior arose from caring too much about everyone and everything.

She comes from a lower middle class background full of addiction, verbal, psychological, and physical abuse, and a Rapunzel style upbringing. Whereas my mom was at least well meaning, her mom’s behavior was pathologically narcissistic. She recently started therapy about it, and the facade of her mom’s love has been falling down around her.

Here’s the thing: I get that there are things she went through that I haven’t. I acknowledge that. I will continue to do so. But I’ve also dealt with things that she hasn’t. The problem is, every time we discuss her abuse, she starts playing this resentful, zero sum game of “Who Got Treated Worse?” It’s like in order for her struggles to be validated, she has to invalidate mine. “At least YOUR mom ____.” “At least YOUR dad ____.” Because I’m further along in my recovery and I don’t want to take away from what she’s dealing with, I’ve let it go. But it doesn’t seem right. Whether she intends it or not it feels deeply resentful, and I have no idea how to broach the topic without sounding like I’m stealing focus.

TL;DR: Girlfriend keeps comparing our abuse and discounting what I went through. I have no idea how to tell her without sounding like I’m stealing focus.",Speedygonzales24,2019-04-07 12:50:45,2,334,34.98,54.76,39.87,1,14.52,22.46,90.12,54.79,20.96,14.37,6.89,1.5,0.6,5.39,0,6.59,3.29,14.07,8.98,4.19,6.89,2.69,15.87,6.29,5.09,2.4,0.3,2.99,9.28,2.4,6.89,0.9,3.59,0.3,13.17,2.1,0.9,6.89,0.3,11.98,2.4,2.1,1.2,1.5,1.5,4.49,1.2,0,0.6,0.3,2.1,0,1.8,0,0,10.18,3.29,0.3,2.99,2.4,1.2,3.29,11.68,0.3,12.28,3.29,6.89,1.8,0.9,1.2,0.3,0.3,0,0,0.6,0,0,0,0.6,0,23.35,6.29,5.99,0.6,0.3,0.3,0,0,2.4,4.49,0.6,2.4

baqfpi,My Girlfriend is Trapped at her parent’s house against her own will (she is an adult). How can I help?,"So my girlfriend is 18 years old, a legal adult here in America. As you can tell from the title, her parents have trapped her at their house. I met her at the state college here. We’ve been together for six months now. About two weeks ago, her parents had decided she was not meant for our university. Her dad withdrew her from the school and forced her to move out. Since doing so, they have taken away her car, phone, and privileges to go anywhere without one of them or her younger brother supervising. She isn’t even allowed to be alone at home. Her mother has called her a slut and a whore since her freshmen year after she was raped. Her dad followed suit, and did the same. Now that she is back at home, they get in to an argument every day. Tonight, I received a call from one of her friends. She had decided to get out of a window and go to a (different) friend’s house for the night until I could make the hour drive to pick her up. I just got a phone call that her father had followed or been notified of her location, went there and took her back. I now fear for her mental health and I don’t know what to do. At this point, no one has any way to get ahold of her or find out what’s going on. Her parents have a history of mentally abusing her and her younger sister, while physically abusing her younger brother. Can anyone give me some advice as to what I can do to try and help this situation and get her out?",MagniThorson1999,2019-04-07 23:40:07,20,302,47.42,94.38,14.19,3.55,15.1,14.24,95.36,60.26,19.54,16.89,3.64,0.66,0.33,10.93,1.32,2.65,5.3,15.89,10.26,4.97,6.62,1.66,17.55,3.31,2.65,1.32,1.99,0.99,2.98,0.33,2.65,0.33,1.32,0.33,23.51,3.64,0.99,11.59,1.66,8.94,1.66,2.32,0.33,2.65,0.33,2.65,0.66,0,0.66,0,1.66,0,0.66,0.99,0,9.93,5.3,0.33,2.65,2.32,0,6.95,11.92,0.99,17.88,3.31,7.28,8.28,1.99,0,1.99,0,0,0,0.66,0.66,0,0,0,0,13.91,5.96,3.97,0,0,0.66,0,0,0,1.99,1.32,0
baqm5f,The first step to look out for,"I had a long talk the other day with my psychologist. I've been seeing her for a long time and once in a while we step outside ""me"" and discuss other subjects we're both interested in. This time it was the pattern of abuse. And she talked about how there really are steps that you can almost number. (I'm going to use the classic man abusing woman genders just because it's easier. I'm aware it often goes both ways.) 

Her point was there's one big first step. And it's the victim's step. Caused by the abuser of course, but it's the victim that displays this behavior. It is watching and censoring every single thing you say so you don't ""set him off"". And the flight response being triggered every time his voice is raised. And accepting that you are responsible for setting him off (that's when he's got ya). All part of the same behavior. It's the old walking on eggshells syndrome, but all the time.

She said once a relationship gets to this point you are already on your way down the slippery slope.

Something to  watch out for.

barpfp,Are his (32m) comments about my (33f) disability funny? In bad taste? Or just abusive?,"Throwaway account as he uses Reddit. Though the identifying information probably negates that!

This post was removed from r/relationships because the mods felt it was more suited to r/abuse or r/emotionalabuse. I'm truly shocked they feel it warrants removal because of that, but feel that the mods are sometimes too quick to remove posts.

TL;DR I started dating ""Tom"" (32m) last month and despite being immediately infatuated with him, it feels as if something is not quite right. We just had a ""meet the friends"" weekend which ended up with me drunk and crying on the train home. I'm wondering if this is salvageable or if I should throw the whole man away.

I have a birth defect (club foot) for which I wear a leg brace. The type of silicone material my leg brace is made out of looks similar to a prosthetic so invariably I have to deal with comments every year from the students I work with (secondary school teenagers) asking if I have a fake leg. I try to be open about it and laugh about myself so I generally reply, 'I'm not a pirate!' or some other nonsense and then explain that I have issues with my ankle. I don't mind the students asking questions, and I try to answer them as best I can, but I feel as if I might be a bit sensitive when the questions/comments come from adults.

I'm trying to wrap my head round some of the comments Tom has made. Each time he feels he has made them in jest but I have quite literally stopped in my tracks to tell him to be nice to me/that he's being mean. He laughs them off and I feel as if maybe I'm being too sensitive.

* The students asking me about my fake leg came up in conversation and I said I might as well make the most of it for Hallowe'en and invest in an eye patch and a parrot. Tom started making comments about my peg leg.
* 'Run Forest! Run!' as we are hurrying up the stairs, trying to make our train
* Calling me a cripple/crippled as we are trying to walk fast to meet his friends when I said I was in pain
* Referring to me as 'Hop-a-long'
* Whilst at the bar with his friends, telling me to 'waddle' to the bar (his friends heard and told him off for his verb choice)

Some other things that have happened over the past weekend, that occurred repeatedly:

* Grabbing my ass waiting for/on the train when I've stated I don't like that kind of PDA
* Shoving his hands down the back of my pants whilst my friends were nearby
* Literally poking me in the asshole whilst my friends were nearby
* Shoving his cold hands up my shirt in front of my friends to make me scream
* Poking me hard in the face/sides with a toothpick until I took it away from him
* Making moo-ing noises at me and making jokes about me being a cow

I had to have a conversation with him a couple of weeks ago regarding the way he speaks to me because I feel that he is rude at times. For instance, in the past he has told me I'm being a ""fucking idiot"" or ""fucking stupid"" for bringing up things he believes are incorrect (ie. he called me ""fucking stupid"" for stating that tomatoes aren't European in origin - which they aren't). He has amended the way he speaks to me, but I feel that I shouldn't have to tell a 32 year old man that calling someone ""fucking stupid"" is not an appropriate way to talk to someone you are dating. If I say something that he feel is incorrect now he makes a show of biting his lip, averts his eyes and just nods along.

After seeing his friends off on Saturday night, we started wandering around the train station attempting to find the correct platform to get home. I was no help as I was very intoxicated. I'm not quite sure what he said to me as my memory of the journey home is very spotty because of the amount of alcohol I drank, but I started crying on the train and was very upset. I ignored him for the first part of the journey home but then apologised because I couldn't stop crying. Eventually, when we got back to mine I ended up full on sobbing into his chest and we ended up having sex.

I woke up with a killer hangover, made worse because of my embarrassment from the day before. He wouldn't touch or really look at me, just made some polite conversation. When I dropped him off at the train station for his journey home he said that the plans we had made for the following weekend were probably not a good idea and that he was going to have to have a think about continuing to see me. I apologised for the way I dealt with being upset and that it was an embarrassing situation to put him in on the train in public. He just nodded and thanked me for the apology, then got out of the car.

TL;DR I'm trying to determine whether it is worth reaching out and trying to apologise to Tom or if my self esteem is so non-existent that I'm putting up with him treating me terribly. Any constructive comments about how to proceed would be very helpful!",Slight_Perspective,2019-04-08 02:30:37,5,945,56.6,42.44,72.88,5.47,24.87,15.77,90.69,58.1,19.05,14.92,9.21,0.85,0.11,4.23,0.53,4.13,6.56,15.77,8.15,4.44,7.83,1.48,18.73,4.44,1.9,1.16,0.21,1.48,4.87,1.48,3.39,0.42,1.38,0.42,12.17,0,0.85,0,4.44,12.7,2.75,2.33,1.38,4.87,0.53,3.6,4.02,0.85,1.27,1.9,3.81,2.12,0.63,0.53,0.63,7.41,2.86,1.16,2.54,0.63,0.53,5.19,9.84,0.85,14.71,2.43,6.35,6.03,0.63,1.06,0.53,0.32,0,0.11,1.27,0.74,0.42,0,0.11,0,14.5,3.28,1.8,0.11,0.21,0.32,0.53,0.53,1.27,2.96,1.48,2.01

bauwjq,Why?! I feel TRAPPED.,"Why do parents demand so much respect but don't treat me or my brother my age with respect?!

They treat my younger brothers with the upmost respect.

One has special needs, and one is just the youngest.

My parents treat me and my brother like cinderellas. They demand the house to be clean all the time. They wake us up at 7 am and yell at us to clean and tell us everything that hasn't been clean. Me and my brother are 18 and work multiple jobs. My dad helps out sometimes with the kitchen. I'm in charge of almost everything. I get absolutely chewed out if I miss a day of cleaning and it's a mess because no one else cleans.

Then my parents guilt trip by telling us everything they do for us. They take our phones early in the morning so we can get our chores done. I'm pretty sure they're narcissists. I can't drive because they ""can't afford it"" (another tactic to keep us home).

They threaten u by saying if we can't keep the house clean then they won't take us to work, which'll get us fired. I can't call anyone to take me because i close myself off at work so I won't get hurt more.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to feel depressed again and I fear that my mental health is going to plummet like it did last year.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to save money to move out, but I don't have access to my account because i spent too much money before.

I'm trying to become independent, but it almost seems impossible.

Several people seen how she treats me or have dealt with her abusive tweets &amp; dm's have called her narcissistic, crazy,bi polar, attention seeking etc. She also goes online at least 2 or 3 times a month &amp; says nobody loves her,she wishes she would die etc. But i also think she might be causing drama for attention. Because some guy i think who isn't even real only but a catfish pays attention to her when she claims people are being mean to her online. So she i think she starts drama on purposes. Several people have stopped communicating with her because they think her behavior is weird. Any idea how i can attract better friends? Because she is the 5 or 6 th person that acts unstable with mood swings",ShanReds1987,2019-04-08 09:59:27,1,199,31.65,81.72,31.4,8.02,14.21,13.57,85.43,49.75,18.09,14.07,5.03,0,0,8.04,1.01,4.02,3.52,10.05,9.05,5.03,8.04,1.01,17.59,4.52,2.01,3.02,2.01,3.02,6.53,2.01,3.52,0,1.51,0,18.59,0,3.02,8.04,0.5,14.07,4.52,3.52,1.01,3.02,0,3.52,1.51,1.01,0.5,0,1.01,0,0,0.5,0,8.04,4.02,1.01,0,2.01,1.51,3.02,14.07,1.01,14.07,1.51,5.53,7.04,0.5,1.01,0,0.5,0,0.5,1.51,0,0,0.5,0,0,13.57,5.53,2.01,0,2.01,0.5,0,0,0,1.51,0,2.01
bawg2i,"Possible stalker, real fear","Hello.. this is my first time on reddit so please bear with me (and this is a long one) I don't usually post online but I'm desperate to find answers about my situation. I didn't know where else to post, because I can't specifically find ""stalker victim"" on reddit for some reason or I'm just such a newbie.

Anyway, for one, I'm not from the US... I'll just say I'm in a country where it's harder to get any help from the police compared to in the US, especially for stalking cases. Also, where I'm from, cellphone numbers are NOT regulated (no need to register.... prepaid sims are being used and disposed of all the time here).

Here's what happened. Somebody called a family member. She told me he immediately said ""is this Amelia (let's just say that's my name)?"" in a loud voice. She replied, ""It's her (family member) who is this and what's your business calling?"" He said ""it's John, so is this Amelia?"" 

Confused, she thought it was one of my workplace's clients or from the bank or whatever, so she told him she doesn't know a John and that she'll just leave a message. But, she also specifically said she isn't Amelia and he probably got the wrong number.

She called me immediately after, naturally, asking me who is john cos he was looking for me. I wasn't too concerned... I told her that's probably from this or that establishment etc or a customer etc and to just give me his number. Because I do know a few with that name!

However, she called back later to tell me more. Apparently he called her back... she kept telling him she's not amelia and he probably got the wrong number.

Convinced that he ""knew"" it was Amelia, he told her ""look, I know you remember me, I've changed, I now work for the government etc, I've changed... this is serious."" Note: ""THIS IS SERIOUS"" - WHY would that matter at all to a person he suddenly calls, unsolicited (dont know if that's the right word), after 15 long years?? (Will explain that part later).

Confused, my sis kept asking questions like where is he calling from, etc and that if he's in the government, maybe she'll be the one to go see him there so that maybe they can sort out some papers or whatever reason there is as to why he was calling.

Perhaps because of all the questions and going around in circles he finally admitted his real name!

He said ""ok ok actually it's Philip..."" and she said he started sharing things and his name rang a bell for her. 

That's because he was my ex from more than a decade ago! About 15 years ago! 

Im talking about boyfriend/girlfriend (we lasted only a few months because there really was something WRONG with him - insecure, possessive, suggested bizzare things etc). 

When she realized who he was, she amped up her supposed ""cluelessness"" and told him she has no idea what he's talking about and she mistook him for someone else thinking he was asking for payment or some bank or work requirements. 

According to her he kept blabbing on because he insists she was me so she pretended that someone was calling her from across the room and put the phone down.

He texted her after that saying he knows it's Amelia, the Amelia he knew 15 years ago. She kept replying to him she mistook him for someone else and sorry he got the wrong number. He sent only maybe 6 messages back and forth replying... until he finally said ""ok maybe this really is the wrong number sorry."" But in a subtly sarcastic way implying that he knows it's me but ""whatever if you say so"" (cant quite describe in my mother tongue).

What concerns me now is some of the things he texted. First, he was like, ""are you married now? I know it's you, it's what it says in your form. I saw your photos though..."" (where?? What photos?? I'll never know!!!).

She texted him (pretending that her number was being used wrongly on someone else's form) ""uh, what name is on that form?"" He texted back my entire full name along with other personal info that I know even he wouldn't know. I mean heck I don't even know or remember his middle name so how can he remember mine unless of course he does indeed have a completed form in front of him.

That is also my concern. A government employee, him, is using personal information. He calls out of the blue and even when it wasn't actually me who answered the phone, and despite being told that was not me, he still typed out my full name and personal information thru text. Also he didn't even have the decency to properly introduce himself first because going ahead asking if it was me. 

Especially in my countru, it is RUDE not to first say, ""I'm sorry for disturbing you but...."" also the fact that he first lied about his name... doesn't that show that he wanted to control the situation and make sure it was ME?! Doesn't that indicate that he in fact knew I would have just put the phone down or ignored him or pretended to be someone else, but despite knowing that he still wanted to force me to speak with him?

He was and is so stupid (and I mean it literally, like uneducated), but I think stupid and crazy is way worse than smart and crazy. At least if the person is smart, you can make deals with them or they know what's good for them when threatened. A stupid and crazy person can continue to do dangerous things despite being warned (like threatened with jail time etc) until maybe they are killed cos their victim did self defense or shot by police.

Now I'm at a loss as to how to actually take this. Am I overreacting, is he just being a wierdo (a safe wierdo)... or could this turn into something way worse? 

Should I wait and if he no longer contacts me or anyone I know should I stop being worried? Was it just a case of... oh wow, ""this is my ex's info on this form I should call her"" or is it more of, I should call her cos I think I still got a chance? After 15 years though?!! Is there something mentally wrong with him has he worsened if he does have a mental health issue?

Just other info, in the few months we were together 15 years ago, he never actually hit me or was physically abusive. However, he did pull my arm a few times when he wanted to ask something ""urgent,"" he did say and do some things that I now realize were red flags... when I had another argument with my dad for instance and confided in him (I was really young that time!), he suggested to me at one point... would you want me to have someone take care of him I know a lot of people you know? (Well, even when I said Out of teenage angst that I wished he disappeared, he never did anything thank goodness).

I didn't take him that seriously that time because he was always full of air and trying to act tough even when he wasn't! For instance he'd say stuff like ""You went to that club? I hate clubs. I'd bomb that club you went to. I'm serious. My dad has some grenades. He has ties to the military."" He said those kinds of things ALL the time. Plus he'd tell me to go home at a certain time (really early) every single day. Then he slowly suggested what i should wear etc. When we were out, he'd tell me, ""did you see that guy just check you out? I took a long hard look at him... he sure as hell got scared!""

In real life he was scrawny although had abs, but he was scrawnier than me and I'm by all means not even chubby. Im a small size all my life, and people often wondered what I saw in him. He was pretty ugly too with an ugly attitude. Looking back I was infatuated cos he knows how to charm (at first) and im actually not a shallow person even til now I mostly care about the person's attitude.... 

...but looking back I just cant help but realize he was overly insecure.. im just stating facts here that his physical attributes while probably not the whole reason, also contributed to his insecurity (im not gonna be politically correct about that!). Cos I mean his whole family actually kinda looked good... he would be the epitome of what ""ugly duckling"" means. And I always felt that he knew that... but besides that, he was always a little loopy/weird/passive aggressive.

Anyway later on In the relationship I would feel he actually lies a lot or there was something about him that I felt he was hiding or like he had an agenda. I now even remember him making fun of me but when asked him what do you mean he said ""Nah I was talking about a friend"" but I know he was talking about me! He did that when he didn't like what I was doing or if I didn't go with his ideas or suggestions or if I had my own opinion of things.

I did not stay long enough with him to know if he is indeed THAT kind of dangerous or if he is just one of those intellectually/emotionally stunted guys who can't move on from an ex even after several years.

I contacted communications govt agency abt this in writing, BUT, Im already guessing all theyre going tell me is BLOCK his number.

And I don't have any further evidence that he is harassing me except for those textes with my family member. 

But what about him, a government employee, using personal information to contact the individual who filled out the form? Is that not illegal? If it is... HOW am I going to trace his number without being caught by him and especially that the number is likely prepaid or even just an online disposable number?

There is also the fact that his family is supposedly well connected (only proof I had was his parents had photos with known politicians). They don't seem to have a lot of money but their posessions are questionable based on their assumed income (I won't say what their work is but you get the point). 

To give you an idea, let's say this person has a small house... not a nice looking house but a house nonetheless while everyone else is struggling to pay rent. And this person just has a local non-profit org. While they don't have ""luxury"" stuff... things just don't connect.

That's just one of the reasons why I broke up with him a long time ago. His background is dodgy. His parents LOOKED normal but they seem like the type who know they have a psycho child but don't want to admit it. And they also seem like your typical con artists. You know, types who go to church but are something else after Sundays.

Please help me where to start. Even I'm scared to contact police because what if the info reaches him... then he can confirm wow, my (family member) actually knows me and now he can come after me!

Sorry this is so long. I never knew I would be in this position. I thought it only happened to other people or in movies. There are also not many well known stalking cases in my country nor is it talked about much! Forget about ""restraining order"" nobody here would probably even know what that means :(

I do have an SO. I'm a home buddy so every time I'm out he's usually with me... that or im with a friend just for coffee or whatever.. I don't go clubbing anymore and if I do it's withba group usually and I always go home with the same company. We also generally dont stay out late IF we even go out anymore. I also don't have a fixed schedule as my job allows me to work from home or choose a schedule most times. Are these enough? Is this uncertainty really gonna be my life now?",Amelia-Jane-Shadows,2019-04-08 10:16:14,11,2097,8.42,63.25,35.61,7.22,15.53,13.69,92.85,62.28,23.99,16.5,6.77,0.43,0.95,7.68,0.67,7.49,4.34,10.11,10.97,8.92,8.3,2.53,20.89,4.82,1.81,2.48,0.95,1.86,4.77,1.43,3.05,0.72,0.91,0.29,17.5,0.62,0.48,1.76,6.29,17.64,4.15,1.91,1.76,5.29,1.72,6.1,2.48,0.91,1.29,0.24,0.52,0.19,0.29,0,0.05,6.01,2.24,0.62,1.81,0.72,0.91,6.72,12.4,0.72,11.21,1.38,4.67,5.44,1.76,0.72,0.72,0.48,0.1,0.05,1.24,0.1,0.38,0.24,0.24,0.1,20.74,7.49,3.15,0.05,0,1.24,0.81,0.14,2.1,3.58,2,0.19

baxg5r,Is this abuse or just parenting?,"Over the past 18 years I have been flooded with constant insults over my body, my hair, my academics etc, all stemming from the fact that my parents wanted this “perfect” daughter. 

It began to really affect me when I began my teenage years when they started to compare me to one of my friends, blonde, skinny, the child they wanted, constantly insulting me for not being like her and I don’t mean like they’d just say they wish I was like her, more like I would be ridiculed and insulted for not being slimmer, for not wearing more makeup, for not curling my hair that day etc, I felt like I couldn’t leave the house without looking “perfect”. It got to the point where I became bulimic. Keep in mind I was already a relatively skinny girl, but I kept feeling ugly, like a waste of space, useless. I also became severely depressed and anxious. 

Things got worse after my nan died, my parents who were already semi regular drinkers would drink every day, getting completely wasted, leaving me and my sister at home while they’d get pissed. Come home and constantly insult me more, made me feel worthless. 

All in all, along with the verbal harassment, I’ve been hit a couple times in a drunken rage, however I don’t hold that against them, they were drunk, it’s not like they’d do that normally.

I love my parents, I really do, but I don’t know how much more I can take of the daily insults, constantly being threatened to be kicked out, not being able to do my school work due to them kicking off over little things which would escalate to larger issues.",Bethisonreddit,2019-04-08 11:42:10,18,291,30.27,13.57,90.49,1,29.1,17.87,93.47,56.7,20.27,15.81,12.03,0,0,0.69,3.09,4.47,3.78,13.06,10.31,5.84,4.81,3.78,20.96,6.87,5.15,2.06,0.69,3.44,7.22,1.03,6.19,0.69,4.12,1.03,9.97,2.06,0.34,1.72,0,13.75,2.41,1.03,2.75,0.34,2.75,4.81,2.06,0.69,0.34,1.03,3.09,1.03,0.34,0,1.72,8.93,2.41,0.69,3.09,2.41,0.69,7.9,8.93,0.34,13.06,1.03,4.81,7.22,1.03,1.37,1.03,0,0,0.34,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,0,17.18,3.09,9.28,0,0,0.34,0,0,1.37,3.09,0,0

bb2x2b,Is this abuse? Am I broken?,"TW: lots of sexual themes.

22F. I keep having repeating dreams of sexual nature involving my mom or aunt (who lived with me my whole childhood). These dreams are extremely disturbing and make me feel like crap. I definitely do NOT have any kind of sexual attraction towards my mother or my aunt. I do have, however, sort of a sexual trauma (or a series of traumas) regarding them.

Basically sex was a topic in the house ever since I was very young - as young as six years old. I was very curious about sex specifically and would ask my mom and aunt lots of weird questions, my aunt would answer them joyfully, my mom kinda avoided them. But I didn't really understand what sex was, it was just childish curiosity for me and the ""sex phase"" eventually ended.

But when I was 11 my aunt got a boyfriend and she would make inappropriate remarks about her sexual encounters to my mother while I was present. Basically she was very happy with her partner's 'sexual prowess' and enjoyed discussing it out loud. But here's the thing, when she started doing it, I would become very embarrassed and upset. I would ask her to stop talking about it, to which she replied I was a brat for not allowing her to have a sex life and be happy. I felt guilty. She considered me as a friend and felt censored by me. After a few times I just tried to ignore her. This went on for two or three years.

I remember she dragged me to some mall and forced me to meet her new boyfriend. I was so angry, I just stormed off and went back home. When she returned, she called me all sorts of ugly names, and my mother just shrugged it off, saying it was better not to force me to like the guy... This was the source of a lot of conflicts as I entered my teenage years.

Talking about my mom. Living with my mother was hell as I was not allowed any kind of privacy. I was born with a medical condition; basically, the inner lips of my vagina were glued together, and when I was a little kid she had to do this 'massage' in order to stop them from becoming completely shut off. When I was 9 or 10, the issue was solved. However, my mom would still inspect my genitalia for a long time - I remember her doing it for the last time when I was 15. It was awful.
Also, when I went to take a shower, I was not allowed to lock the door, and she or my aunt would barge in multiple times during each shower to just chat or maybe pee or whatever. I was supposed to think this was normal, and I did, until I grew a little bit older and realized it was odd. I requested them to stop doing it and to allow me to lock the door. My mom freaked out. Everytime she found the bathroom door locked she would become extremely angry. As for my aunt... She mocked me. She said ""I'm not interested in that thing you have between your legs"".

During my teenage years I also realized I was bisexual. They kinda suspected this was the case and would corner me and ask weird questions. My aunt would say how the whole ""scissoring"" thing put her off, and that when she was younger people would think she was a lesbian, but that she was far from it, etc etc etc. Basically used the whole thing to reaffirm herself sexually.
These are just two examples of my mom and aunt's weird behavior. There are lots of other things but I don't think they are quite as relevant to this story. Basically, my mom is super clingy and controlling, and my aunt is narcissistic and has this super weird necessity to keep telling everyone that she is, in fact, a sexual being. I also have misophonia and misokinesia and one of my triggers is seeing people with their hands resting on their legs - I become angry because I think they are masturbating in public. Very weird, right? My first trigger was my aunt, then my mom, then everyone. I have never seen my mom or my aunt masturbating but apparently something has made my brain project that image.

I ended up moving out of the house at 20. They have moved out of the city and I have a hard time tolerating Mom's countless phone calls per day. As for my aunt, she doesn't say anything weird or sexual to me anymore. But she is a very hard person to deal with. I try to keep the talking to a minimum with her.


Back to the dreams. In these dreams my mom or aunt would force me to perform sexual acts with them. The dreams are very vivid and disturbing. In some dreams I refuse and in others I comply. I wake up feeling very disturbed and fucked up. I hate this. I feel like I need to pour bleach over my brain. Egh.

As I read everything I have written I realize it's kinda messy and poorly connected. I'm sorry. I'll just tell you guys how I feel.

I feel like something has messed up and polluted my mind. I feel broken, disgusting and violated. And I don't know exactly why, but these are some clues that I have as to why I have become like this.

What do you guys think about this? Does anyone have a similar experience? Is it too late for me? Am I never going to be normal and not have dreams about fucking my mom?",SelfIndulgentKiddo,2019-04-08 20:07:26,4,963,19.44,36.99,73.2,3.28,13.56,13.6,94.08,60.54,21.81,16.2,11.42,0,0.42,3.12,1.25,5.61,4.05,11.94,10.59,6.44,8.83,1.35,18.8,5.09,1.97,1.77,1.14,1.87,4.67,1.14,3.53,0.73,1.25,0.1,12.88,3.22,0.73,6.44,0.52,14.75,3.53,2.39,1.45,3.95,1.56,3.32,2.39,0.42,0.73,1.14,3.63,1.14,0.42,2.28,0,4.26,0.73,0.73,2.18,0.31,0.42,6.65,8.52,0.52,11.01,1.14,4.26,5.71,0.42,1.14,0.93,0.1,0.1,0,0.83,0.52,0.31,0,0,0,14.54,7.06,3.53,0.1,0.1,0.73,0,0.31,0.62,1.66,0.42,0

Every time I would talk she would interrupt me and just yell at me to stop laughing even though I wasn't. Eventually, I got tired of it so when she told me to explain it to her I said I already did, She got even more pissed and grabbed the top of my head and squeezed it(She has long sharp nails). She then began pulling on my hair and yelling at me. After she was done pulling my hair she slapped me and left my room. I grabbed the top of my head because it hurt and when I took my hand off it was like petting a dog that was shedding. My hair had got pulled out by my mom. 

I was wondering if this happens to other people or should I be concerned. This is the first time my mom has ever pulled my hair out. I have been slapped, pushed, and hit but when she pulled my hair it seemed a little odd.",Ramonnoodles900,2019-04-08 22:31:13,3,272,9.47,16.95,95.02,8.31,16,11.76,93.75,61.4,25.74,21.69,16.18,0,0,5.51,0,4.04,3.31,10.29,9.93,6.62,9.19,1.47,21.69,2.94,2.21,1.47,1.1,0.74,4.78,1.47,2.94,0,2.21,0.37,11.76,1.84,0,7.35,0.37,8.09,1.47,0.37,2.57,1.84,1.1,3.31,4.41,0.37,1.84,2.21,1.84,1.47,0.37,0,0,5.88,0.37,1.84,2.57,2.21,0.37,10.29,6.62,1.1,18.01,3.31,6.99,7.72,2.21,0,1.47,0,0,0,0.74,0.37,0,0,0,0.37,10.29,5.88,1.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.84,0.74,0
bb4tw6,"""You can't teach an old dog new tricks.""","This is what I've been told a few times whenever I talk about holding my abuser accountable. Maybe I'm viewing it wrong, because one of the people who told me this was a therapist, and I don't get it. If you're talking about someone losing their mental capacity, then I'm in agreement. Not being in your right mind because of age is the only possible way for this statement to make sense. The only thing you require to understand that you've hurt someone is the ability to reason and comprehend. If you have that, you have no excuse. 

Otherwise, what these people are suggesting is basically ""Well, I have some problems, and I should probably work on- oh, no! I've just turned 55, and I've suddenly and inexplicably lost the ability to make personal changes based on what I perceive! there must be some sort of force field!""....Okay, that was a little silly and rant-y, but do you see my point? You don't just arbitrarily stop being accountable for your actions because you've been doing them for a while. You might be more stubborn because of age, but stubbornness is still a choice that you can be held accountable for, and it shouldn't be normalized.",Speedygonzales24,2019-04-09 00:04:39,0,215,5.57,72.72,49.53,3.52,17.92,18.14,95.81,63.72,21.4,13.02,6.05,0,6.05,0,0.93,8.37,5.12,8.37,16.74,6.51,8.84,3.26,22.33,3.26,0.47,2.33,0.93,1.86,6.51,1.86,4.19,0,1.86,1.4,12.56,0,0,0,0,17.67,3.72,4.65,2.79,5.58,0.47,3.26,2.33,0.93,0,0.47,0.47,0,0.47,0,0,6.05,0,2.33,1.86,0.47,1.86,5.12,14.42,0.93,10.7,1.4,4.19,5.12,1.4,0,0,1.4,0,0,1.4,0,0,0.47,0.93,0,22.33,6.05,6.05,0,0,0.47,1.4,0.93,1.86,5.58,0,0
bb5j6w,Advice? Similar experiences? On my situation with BF's family,"This is my first ever post so please be gentle with me. 


So my boyfriend (M21) and I (18F) have been together for about 9 months now, and he is really great, he is truly one of the kindest, sweetest people I have met. It is both of our first proper, serious relationship. I was in a relationship for 2 years from 15-17 where I was emotionally and sexually abused, and as a result this has impacted my self-esteem and trust. I am in therapy and medicated, and it has made a world of difference. I am fully self-aware about my bad traits, and the bad traits I bring to a relationship, and I try my best to work through them, however there have been times where I can be extremely insecure and difficult to deal with. Without going into detail, this has obviously caused some fights, which kept happening until he decided to move back home for a week or so. We have since made amends, discussed what needs to change, and these changes have been happening. All-in-all we are back to being our harmonious selves. I am going to two therapies weekly, and I am committed to doing my part to make things better.


Now, for the part that's been getting me down. His family.


When he went back to his mother's house, he told her that we were taking a break. During our relationship we've spent 90% of the time at my house, and a weekend here and there at his families house. I would say we probably had three fights at his place. So his mother told him that the fights she heard us having caused her to have to see a psychologist, as well as his father, and she had to explain to the kids (his younger siblings) 'what was happening'. (His parents have been divorced for years, he is an ex-alcoholic, has thrown a vase at bf's mum's head in the past, and bf's mum abandoned her children for various amounts of time while she was with another man). Moreover, his mother told bf to block me on everything, because I would try to 'harass' him. He didn't, and he didn't need to, because I respected his space and didn't contact him until he contacted me. She told him I am never welcome in the house again and that she doesn't want someone like me around the kids.  She made him go stay at his older brother's house for the weekend, and he was told how good it was that we were 'broken up', and telling him to never get back with me. He had to keep it a secret that he had been talking to me during all of this, because whenever he would take out his phone, his mother would say ""that better not be mallorykx"".

 Prior to all of this happening, I had noticed that some of his family members had blocked me out of the blue on instagram. We both thought this was strange, but didn't think anything of it at the time.  It turns out that basically, bf's mum invited everyone around for a ~family dinner~ (excluding bf and I) and shit-talked our relationship, and me, and that's the reason for all the sudden blocks.  When bf found out about this, he was really pissed, and visited his mum to tell her to stop talking about his business to the whole family (which she is notorious for doing in his past). He thinks that he got through to her, and he has since been in good spirits about everything.


I, however, have this crushing guilt that I've somehow ruined his families lives, and kinda wish he had never told me any of the stuff his mother had said about me. I know he didn't have bad intentions to do so, I think he was just overwhelmed by it all and had to get it out. He keeps telling me more things every now and then and it really gets me down, and makes me feel like everything is my fault, when I'm trying so hard to have a productive mindset about stuff like this. I know it sounds pretty, but it also pisses me off that his mother still interacts with his ex-girlfriend (which he disapproves of, and who tried to control literally how he dressed) and just cuts me off like I'm a cancerous growth on her son's life. I do trust that he loves me no matter what they say, but it's bought up a lot of trauma for me, and I just have trouble navigating it. I know I can only really accept it all, too. 


Tldr: Boyfriend's mother getting involved in mine and boyfriend's relationship putting a strain on my mental health.

bbabiq,I'm literally at a loss of what to do,"I've been living with violent people almost all my life, as my dad was verbally abusive towards me. I few years ago my parents got a divorce and I really did think things were going to get better but they didn't. I have an 11 year old brother who was diagnosed with ADHD and ODD and he is incredibly violent towards everybody. Our animals, my mother, me, and the rest of my family. I don't think his behavior is in any way caused by my mother, as she did everything she possibly could have to help him. Reward systems, punishments, medication, anything the therapists said to try she did, but nothing seemed to really work. All his medications only made him more irritable and violent. He punches people, throws them against walls, kicks, throws hard and heavy objects, and destroys property. He even nearly killed one of our pet frogs by slamming his fist down on top of it's enclosure. He always calls my mom and I slurs, lots of swears, and insulting names. I've told my therapist about some of this, but I plan to tell her more this coming Monday. I really can't take much more of this, especially the harassment towards our animals that I would rather not go into detail of. I'm always scared of when he goes into his rages that he will seriously hurt or kill me or my mother. It's always when he doesn't get his way, too. He just bullies people into doing what he wants and I'm tired of seeing my mom have to suffer his wrath. I don't feel safe with him living here, especially among animals.

bbacpw,"AITA, Abuse Edition","CW: child abuse, sexual abuse, damn long story
TLDR at bottom

Background: My mother’s father was severely sexually abusive in her childhood (60s-era). As an adult, she decided not to outright live in denial, but to live like it didn’t happen. In the 80s, my sister and I were allowed to know our grandparents and stay at their house, etc. This resulted, surprise surprise, in sexual abuse starting with oral rape when I was two or three, and going on for years. I’m kind of afflicted now.

Now, sex abuse doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It requires an intricate web of lies, denial, control, and manipulation, and it must be woven and maintained by people other than just the perpetrator. There is even a pattern of recruitment and exclusion of people to do these jobs. For example, if you bring home a new SO, the family will be more likely to accept and feel comfortable around someone who seems more easily controlled than someone who seems principled and independent.

So my mother participated in this web, chose it over my safety, and has never really accepted responsibility for feeding me to this monster, nor for the years of manipulation at her hands to ensure I felt worthless. And she certainly hasn’t grasped that I struggle with real issues because of it that interfere with my daily functioning, like PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc.

The thing is, I think she genuinely believes I am lazy, obstinate, and spoiled. She doesn’t look at me and feel compassion for the child she harmed, she looks at me and feels disappointment and embarrassment. She feels frustration that I don’t make her look better and vindicate her parenting methods. All of her behaviors belie these perceptions of me, and yet when questioned, she’ll vehemently deny feeling this way. She doesn’t even seem to know what she’s feeling, but yet her feelings do control her behavior.

So she finds excuses for being angry and hateful. For example, she’ll take out work stresses on others and then be convinced that she did no such thing; she was only screaming because she folded laundry in the den for an hour and no one came to help her because everyone thinks they get to live in her house and not help out. But last week she might have folded laundry happily for an hour and even turned away help.

Growing up, I believed her when she would rage. I would resolve not to do XYZ again or not to ignore ABC. But of course her demands were always vague enough to have not been done correctly, and trying not to ignore something when you don’t know what it is doesn’t really work, and just produces an unbearable tension and anxiety that interferes enough in your functioning to earn you more rage, just when you start to let your guard down. I felt like I was never good enough, but worse, she would never admit, when questioned, that she felt that way. 

I also know she saw in me a lot of warning signs that I was being abused, but refused to let them get through her Denial. I failed at school, spaced out all the time, teachers raised concerns constantly that something was bothering me. I chewed my nails, feared everything, forgot everything, suffered excruciating stomach pains. I was bullied and had trouble making friends, couldn’t talk to strangers. I had no sense of personal space or bodily privacy. I wanted to die by the time I was ten. My symptoms of PTSD , anxiety, and depression were chalked up to being “spoiled” and “demanding attention”. I simply cannot imagine ignoring such distress in my own child, let alone blaming them for it.

She is convinced that whatever emotional neglect or abuse I suffered was just an inconvenience, and that I exaggerate, and that because it’s “in the past” and she “can’t undo it now”, that I’m getting too hung up on it. Over the years I’ve come to understand what I did and did not experience, and how wrong it was that a lot of these things happened to me. I don’t think she would accept her actions as abuse. She still pulls strings to manipulate our family, creates chaos, undermines relationships, and she will not hear anything against it. She is convinced that her perceptions are driven by reality, and not by her inherited need to control, silence, and weave a protective web around child abuse.

I still have trouble knowing whether I am right in labeling her as an “abuser”. With my grandfather, it is very clear cut. I vividly remember specific acts that incontrovertibly violate every rule in the book. But with her, it feels like I’m imagining abuse where maybe she was just angry, or I was too sensitive. Plus it’s easy to try and justify her behavior because of the awful childhood she had.

And her abuse was different. She wouldn’t explicitly say “you’re lazy,” or “you’re selfish”, but *everything* in her behavior said this was what she thought. She once caught me standing in thought while in the shower, though there was no explicit rule against this, she felt I was wasting time and water because of my inherent selfishness and self-absorption. She didn’t say this exactly, but she raged at me for “just standing there” and carried on about how unbelievable it was and made me feel like no one gets lost in thought in the shower until I felt like I was a complete freak who should have known better, and I felt ashamed thinking back on how many showers I’d spent like that without even knowing I was being weird and selfish. But the kicker is that for literally *years* after this, nearly every time I went to take a shower, she called after me, “and actually *take* the shower, don’t just *stand there*.” This was VERY typical. It was like at any moment I could be humiliated, and be made to feel like I deserved it. And I believed I did deserve it; I still feel like I’m just irritating and abnormal and not tryig hard enough to hide my gross insides.

So she never explicitly said, “You are a bad person,” but she did treat me like I would screw up if I wasn’t kept in line, and I always felt unable to keep up with her expectations. I’m almost 40 now, and I still feel fear about how she’ll react to things, and this influences how much Truth I tell her. I definitely fear to challenge her. Plus, how is it not abuse to essentially feed and cover for someone you know is a pedophile?? 

I guess I would like to know if she is really an abuser because I kind of feel like she’s currently trying to mess with my mind. One of the ways she controls is that when you get in trouble, she’ll bail you out. But it always comes with strings attached, and in the end, you *will* be perceived as ungrateful. But she doesn’t see it this way. 

Recently, I had to take my preschooler and leave my husband in a hurry. She let us live with her. This was on the surface a generous gesture, but it was made clear that we were an imposition. And almost immediately, she tried to “recruit” me to her side against my sister and her husband, who were not on speaking terms with her. Then she and her flying monkeys began to scrutinize my daily activities (“Bob said when he came over, you were still on the couch on your phone”) and it became clear I was not becoming self-sufficient fast enough for her, and that she was painting me as lazy.

Eventually she took out her work stress by raging at me and my preschooler, frightening her and humiliating me, because she was being “kept awake” at 10:00pm by my small child, who I was (apparently) purposefully allowing to stay up late, despite knowing this bothered my mother (I did not), because I was “just being stubborn”. I found this unacceptable, and told her so, but she insisted she “just raised her voice” and anyone would have done it because of how aggravating me and my kid were being. 

Ok, I can read the writing on the wall and I’ve seen her do this to plenty of other people in my life: she likes the initial thrill of being a Rescuer, but then it gets boring or tiring, or they’re proving unwilling to be her punching bag, and so she sets them up to do something “wrong” with herself as the victim so she can feel justified in withdrawing her help.

We spent the next few days staying elsewhere and securing new living arrangements. You’d think she’d be happy to have her house back, since it was so hard to live with us, right? Wrong. Nope, somehow this “broke her heart” and my stepfather’s, when they were nice enough to help us move and let us stay with them. And she must not be all that bad, she says, because we always come running to her when we need rescuing, etc. The night we moved, she and my stepfather chewed me out for an hour, telling me moving out was the wrong decision and I was being petty and childish and not thinking of my daughter. They then made a point of revoking everything they had gifted me or lent me a hand with over the past year that they had any kind of claim on. I was calm and didn’t rise to this, but apparently that wasn’t right either because I was “not being communicative”. 

I just want to know if I’m the asshole here. At the very least, I feel like a failure because I don’t have a “real job” and I’m in my 30s. So on some level I feel like she’s justified in saying I’m lazy and entitled because I’m not on my feet like adults are expected to be. But on the other hand, I have a happy and healthy preschooler that I genuinely try to defend from abuse. And I mean, I have PTSD from being raped before kindergarten, *because of my own mother*. Not everybody gets over abuse like that enough to be 100% functional. She would say I’m making excuses, though. It’s hard to know what to think.

TLDR: I have PTSD somethin fierce because my mother abused me (i think) and also knowingly didn’t protect me. She says I am ungrateful for help she’s given me recently and there’s no reason I should suck at life this much, but I think she might actually be the asshole here.

bbebys,Escape,"I recently got out of an abusive (verbal, emotional, and occasionally physical) relationship with my mother.

I've been around her yelling since birth. It started with my father and her fighting, divorce, and then, around age 10, her yelling directed itself at me and my siblings. I was a nice, shy, and emotional young boy back then. Seeing her yell hurt me so much. Today, I am 18 years old and can barely remember what that pity for her felt like. I'm so hurt today that my personality has changed to a point where I don't even know what - how - to feel. I can feel my throat tightening and very rarely, my bottom lip wobbles... my soul feels tainted. My emotional nature is just gone. It feels like I'm a chemical that needs its activation energy to be met before I can release my emotions, and man does that take a lot.﻿

I told a teacher about what happened and she cried, telling me that (after my mom sent a text to me saying that she never wanted to see me, was ashamed of me, etc. etc.) my mother was incredibly cruel and it hurt her to see someone like me - who she called a shining star - abused. She sent me to the counselor and she said it was nothing. The counselor then (likely for legal reasons) sent me to an officer and he said it was normal behavior from a mother.

Feels great to have 8 years of targeted abuse swept under the rug by adults who don't give a damn. I'm barely hanging on now and I don't know what I would have done without my dad. I just don't know how I'm ever going to get better.",Salad999,2019-04-09 15:29:13,1,291,20.86,45.88,75.22,1,14.55,14.09,93.81,58.42,23.37,16.49,12.37,0,0,4.12,0,6.87,4.81,11.34,9.28,6.53,6.87,2.41,21.31,5.15,2.75,3.09,1.03,0.69,8.25,1.37,6.53,0.69,3.09,1.72,14.43,2.75,0,5.15,1.72,9.97,3.78,2.06,1.03,2.06,1.03,0.34,6.53,1.37,2.06,3.09,1.03,0.69,0.34,0,0,5.5,1.03,0.34,2.41,1.72,0.34,8.25,13.06,1.37,13.75,3.09,3.44,7.56,1.37,0.34,0.34,0,0.34,0,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,0,18.56,7.22,4.81,0,0,0,0,1.37,0,3.09,2.06,0
bbfjht,My dad just charged at me,"I’m shaking as I type this so please forgive me for any errors. To give a little background, I’ve grown up in an emotionally abusive household. I’m 22 years old and live with my parents still. Things have always stayed emotionally abusive until recently. About 2 months ago my mom charged at me and started hitting me. She had her hands around my throat shaking me and screaming at me. I had no injuries and didn’t file a police report. I stayed with my cousin for 2 weeks after this situation. My mom apologized right after it happened and hasn’t brought it up since. I vented to my dad about how hurt I was and listened to me cry about this for days. 

Fast forward to today. A kitchen pan got scratched up and my mom yelled at me about it earlier assuming it was my fault. I explained i didn’t know what happened and about 2 hours later my dad comes in my room to ask me what the hell i did to it and it wasn’t like that before. I told him i didn’t know. 2 minutes later he comes in my room ANGRY. I shut my bedroom window and explained how embarrassing it is for our neighbors to hear them constantly screaming and to lower his voice. Everything is kind of a blur but he continued to scream and charged at me and put his hands on me. At this point I’m screaming and crying for him to get away from me and out of my room. He said he was going to bust out all my car windows. I told him i was going to call the police on him. I didn’t end up doing it. I’ve been crying and shaking trying to figure out what I’m supposed to do now. 

5 minutes later my mom comes in and asks if I’m okay. I tell her obviously not and asked why she thought that was okay. She told me “i never said it was okay”. I then told her that she’s done the same thing to me before and told her she justified that kind of behavior the second she put her hands on me months ago. I asked her to leave me alone.  I left without saying anything. My mom is asking me where i went, but I’m not sure if i feel totally comfortable telling her. 

I honestly feel broken. My parents know i struggle with depression and anxiety. I don’t know if i should report it. I have a 17 year old brother that also lives with us and I’m scared for him too. Can anyone give me some advice with how to proceed? I’m at my cousins house and they’ve offered me to move in plenty of times, but i guess i was hoping things would get better.

bbg50m,Never told anyone about my abuse. This is the first time I'm saying anything.,"CW: CSA

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 18 now, and I think my abuse happened when I was 6/7 ish, though I don't have clear memories from my childhood so I'm not certain about that. I've never told a single soul about it, I wrote it down once then burned the pages because I couldn't risk anyone reading it. Things have been happening lately and I think about it all the time now. I need to process it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a brother who is 6 years older than me, so when I was 6/7 he was 12/13. He would bring me into his bedroom and touch me and kiss me. I don't think I was ever penetrated. I remember there were times where I had to hide in the closet because maybe he heard someone coming, or a time where I kissed him back and he told me to stop and just lay there. There was a time when I was just there thinking ""I wish I didn't have to do this"" ""I wish he'd stop"" ""How much longer is this going to take"". I don't know how long or often it happened, but I know it happened multiple times. If I had to make a guess, I'd say there were several instances over a few months. But one of the things that really gets me is that I don't have really any memories from this. The memories I just shared are all the memories that I have. I used to try to convince myself that it didn't really happen since I couldn't remember it, that I just made it up. But that's a pretty fucked up thing to just make up. I sometimes think it would be easier to deal with if I could remember, that if I really knew what happened I could properly process it rather than just make an educated guess. Something that I feel really guilty and ashamed about is that 1. My brother did this to me, 2. I went along with it, and 3. I never said anything. It's humiliating to be the victim of incest, even worse when you never fought back. I did everything he told me to, I don't think I ever said no or fought back. I just went along with it. Also, the fact that I never said anything makes it worse. I knew it was wrong, though I don't I realized just how wrong it was at that age. I should have said something, to someone, anyone. I could've made it stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know much about dissociation, so I can't say that I experienced it as a child, but I remember often feeling that I was living in a cartoon. Things just didn't feel totally real sometimes. As a child told my sister, who is 2 years older than me, that sometimes it feels like I'm in a cartoon. She said sometimes she feels the same way. It makes me wonder if he hurt her too. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning, I mentioned things have been happening lately and I think about it a lot now. It's always something that's in my mind regardless, but I'm having a harder time pushing it away. My mother is finally kicking out my brother, who is 24 now and still living at home. He's finally going to be out of my life, so I think it's finally time to deal with this and move on.",anonymous8575,2019-04-09 18:24:37,2,595,3.03,9.22,97.15,7.98,15.66,11.09,94.12,66.05,27.23,15.63,13.28,0,0.17,2.18,0,11.6,4.2,9.75,11.93,11.6,7.06,3.36,25.21,3.19,2.35,2.18,2.86,1.68,3.53,1.01,2.52,0.67,1.01,0.17,8.07,0.84,0,0.84,2.18,20.5,4.87,2.35,2.86,5.38,2.52,4.71,3.36,0.17,1.51,1.51,0.84,0,0.5,0.34,0,5.21,1.18,0.34,1.85,0.34,1.51,8.91,13.28,1.01,14.62,1.34,4.2,9.58,0.17,0.34,0.5,0,0.17,0,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0,19.66,6.39,4.2,0.17,1.34,0,0,0,1.01,4.71,0,1.85
bbgeyl,advice on how to deal with my family,"WARNING: mention of sexual, mental + physical abuse

first post on reddit ever so bear with me.

also this is way longer than I wanted it to be. i guess i really needed to vent... sorry guys

Background: When my sister (25f) and I (23f) were kids we were forced to hang out a lot, but she was a total bully. I always told myself that it was normal older sister stuff, but more recently I realized that it probably wasn't as normal as I made it out to be. She always had to put me down or put me in my place. For example having to win first place in every game or else she'd throw a fit (like screaming until she was red in the face kind of tantrum), hit me, pin me down and threaten me. She would often fly into rages like this where she couldn't control herself, she had to hurt someone or throw something, and I was her main target a lot of the time just because I was smaller and younger. One thing I haven't talked about with her, or literally anyone else, because tbh I'm not even sure if I'm remembering it right, but I remember her molesting me. My mom made us take showers together until I was about 6 or 7. I remember feeling extremely sick to my stomach and saying that I don't want to do that stuff, but she went for it anyway. This happened several times. When I brought up the other hurtful stuff (like when she twisted my arm and pinned me to my bed in middle school demanding that I give her all of my money, or when she degraded me and called me ugly, or when she belligerently criticizes anything that I mention liking whether she actually knows anything about it or not), she cried and said she's ""blocked most of those memories out and she can't remember doing any of it but that she's sorry anyway"".

Anyway, before my parents took her to a psychologist they tried to ignore these problems, and they'd tell her she was acting ridiculous, call her names like wench, crazy, bitch, that kind of thing. My dad even pinned her to the wall once and just screamed full in her face that she needed to just stop and shut up, and my sister still brings it up to my parents as an example of the abuse she herself suffered as a child on their watch. They would yell at me and threaten me too if I got involved in the daily shitshow but I pretty quickly figured out the best ways to de-escalate these situations. Sometimes if I decided it wasn't worth get involved, my mom would come to me and croon that I was ""the good one"" while my sister screamed bloody murder in the background. When they finally took her to the doctor she was diagnosed with bipolar type II, at the age of 11.

I think because my parents were emotionally abusing her, sometimes just smacking her in response to meltdowns, I was an easy target for her to unleash all that pent-up rage on. Not to mention the overt favoritism that they showed towards me, which we both resented - she because I got more positive attention from them, and me because it created more tension between my sister and I. The way she treated me as a child, as a pre-teen and a teenager, not to mention the environment we were raised in, gave me huge issues with my self-esteem, extremely bad anxiety and depression that impacted my grades and social life. It was, and is, a constant emotional tightrope. None of these things were addressed because, I felt, all the focus was on my sister and since I wasn't hurting myself or other people, I was fine.

Then when we were teenagers she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, survived, then relapsed a couple years after, and survived again. So on top of everything else, now she has PTSD from an extremely traumatic treatment process where she barely made it out alive.

The issue now is that she considers me her best friend and her closest confidant, and I'm the only person who is able to calm her down when she spirals into her worst moods. However I can't help but feel like an emotional dumpster, because every conversation we have it just feels like she's telling me about how awful she feels and how she's terrified that there's something new that's wrong with her (physically mostly, sometimes mentally). I understand because I was there the whole way through her treatment and I know that bipolar disorder is a hell of an illness. Mostly she talks and I listen, unless I'm giving her some form of sympathy or comfort.

But even when she's feeling okay she only ever wants to talk about what's going on with her, and all of our conversations are very one-sided. When I try to talk about what's going on with me (just, like, everyday life events) she kind of spaces out and mumbles ""yeah"" without offering to continue the conversation or she changes the subject back to her.

I feel like she just uses me as a sort of therapy doll. I feel like an asshole to expect her to want to listen about my life, because she's been through so much, but tbh she hasn't really been much of a friend to me and I feel like she only likes me because I'm pretty much the only steady person she has in her life. I don't know what would happen if I tried to demand anything more of her.

The reason I'm making this post is because she's been away for a little while now and I'm feeling so much better now that she's gone, like a weight has been lifted off of me, but I even feel guilty because of that. When she's here it's like I'm constantly on edge as if waiting for some disaster to happen - for her to hurt herself, or needing me to talk her down from a ledge, or that I'm going to have to break up an explosive argument (which in my family results from almost every conversation, and I've been reffing these fights since I was literally a kid). Sometimes I feel like I'm literally the only thing keeping them together. As much as I want to just fuck off, I would feel terrible abandoning my sister who has literally no one but my shitty parents. But I also don't want to confront them about all of this pent-up nonsense I'm dealing with.

Also, I don't have any friends and I still live with my parents due to financial reasons, so I feel like my only option is to stick around and continue to keep the peace.

bbivm3,Was this abuse or just weird? (cleaning out mother's vagina as a child),"First post I've ever made so sorry if it's a bit messy (might be a bit graphic, sorry).

Background: I'm looking for a job and live between my two parents (who are divorced). My mother struggles with a drug habit and her mental health (including being sexually abused as a child). She's never gotten proper help for her problems.

When I was a kid, from the ages of about 7-11/12, my mother would ask me to help her clean her vagina out. 

This involved using cotton buds to clean her genitals out from white flecks of toilet paper and sometimes discharge. She'd use a mirror to look at herself down there and use her other hand to move around, looking around her vagina. Sometimes I'd trim her pubic hair. 

I specifically remember moving the cotton buds on/around her clitoris a lot (because it was kinda easy for the specks to get stuck there) which can be arousing for women. I don't know if I'm seeing this worse than what it is because I can only get off to clit simulation in masturbation so I assume it must have felt good for her (I don't have sex because I'm repulsed at the idea of ever sharing a bed with someone because of these memories).

I never was touched by her. I never physically touched her (except with the cotton buds/trimmers). But I do remember her having some kind of discharge which, the more I think about, the more I wonder if it was her being aroused by what was happening. I wondered at the time why she kept on looking at her vagina, moving her fingers about, telling me to make sure she was clean, especially at deeper parts of her vagina.

I didn't know anything about women's bodies at the time. I'm pretty sure there were times I moved the cotton bud over her vaginal entrance, never in it, but definitely about it. I didn't even know that vaginas could be penetrated at the time.

I feel repulsed every time I think about it. I blocked out most of the memories, never discussing it with anyone ever since, but it just doesn't feel right. I hadn't even thought about it for years until my mother told me about her own sexual abuse as a child and now I have mixed feelings. Did she just need help cleaning herself? She didn't have any disabilities at the time that prevented her doing it herself (I feel like she would have told me if there was anything because she overshares to get sympathy). Am I overthinking this? 

I've never heard of people doing things like this for their parents. The last few months I've started remembering it, the more disgusted I am with her. I already have deep anger for her because she was the reason my parents split and her drug habits are destroying the remains of my family.

The worst part is that she still has the mirror she used years ago. I've developed such a strong sense of hatred for it. I also feel disgusted whenever I look at her fingers because it reminds me of her moving her fingers about her vagina and clitoris. 

I'm scared this is going to affect any future sexual relationships I might have with a potential partner, and my relationships with my mother and the rest of my family. I already hated her before because of her drug habits and could barely sleep in the same house in peace, but now I feel like everything I used to think of her before the drugs was a lie - she wasn't a wonderful mother turned abusive because of drugs, she's just naturally like that.

TL;DR: My mother got me to clean her vagina when I was a young child and I'm not sure if it was for arousal or not. Part of me wants to seek further help, but I'm not sure if it's even worthy of that. 

Was it abuse or am I overthinking?",WaitingHorse,2019-04-09 23:45:50,15,688,28.1,42.5,37.2,10.92,19.11,14.53,93.31,60.9,21.95,15.84,8.87,0,0,6.83,0.15,6.1,5.52,14.24,10.76,7.27,6.4,2.47,19.19,4.94,2.76,1.31,0.73,2.03,4.65,1.74,2.91,0.29,1.31,0.29,13.08,1.89,0.44,8.14,0,16.42,3.63,2.91,2.03,4.36,2.76,3.63,3.34,1.16,0.15,1.89,5.38,3.34,1.31,3.2,0,5.52,2.18,0.29,2.18,0.87,0.58,6.1,9.88,0.87,11.77,1.02,4.8,5.81,0.44,0.29,0.58,0,0,0,0.15,0,0.15,0,0,0,15.7,4.51,2.62,0.29,0.44,0.58,0,0.29,0,3.92,2.33,0.73
bbmgpc,Was I abused/groomed or am I overreacting?,"Just a heads up I have never really used reddit before so I'm not entirely sure how things work but I've heard that reddit communities can be very helpful so I wanted to give it a shot and just get this off my chest. I'm on a mobile so the formatting or whatever might be messed up, so sorry in advance, also sorry for any spelling/grammatical errors.

!! This is also going to contain the topic of pedophilia and some nsfw mentions as well as a brief animal abuse mention, so watch out if that's not something you want to read about !! 


So as the title states, I'm not even sure if this counts as anything more than just being a creep/a disgusting person or if this is something deeper than that, I honestly can't tell if this has made a deep lasting impact on me, though it scared me off of friendships and going into any kind of relationship even more than I already had been.
So I met this guy online when I was about 14 years old, he was. 16? maybe 17, I can't remember. I was a cringey kid but right off the bat we got along really well, and after being friends for a few months we started dating. I had always had bad thoughts related to violence due to prior parental abuse, and he was the only one that made me feel like I wasn't a complete freak for having them, in fact he indulged and encouraged them and told be to do bad things to myself. He was obsessed with shota/loli content (basically borderline anime cp) and would constantly call me a ""shota"" and bring up my age, then tell me how much he hated teens and how they were so annoying but how I was so mature for my age, as well as constantly doing sexual things with me. We broke up and dated once more after that, but I felt it didn't work out so we simply stayed best friends from that point. When he was 18-19 and I was 16, he confessed to me that he was a pedophile, around that time he started growing extremely toxic too. I wasn't surprised at his pedophilia confession and I should've cut him off then and there, but he was the only friend I had so I tried to ignore the toxicity and tell him it was okay, especially since he'd told me he had told his therapist and would never act on it. He then would constantly tell me how I was ""vanilla"" and so ""inexperienced"" because I wasn't into the stuff he was, aka because I didn't want to f*ck toddlers. I have old screenshots of messages where I was honestly believing it and calling myself boring for basically not being into kids, and I feel so horrible for not actually stepping up and doing something. 
My current girlfriend broke off our relationship and I hadn't been in contact with him for 2 years when I recently found out he'd been taken in by police, reported by some of his friends since he'd made disturbing jokes about having sexually abused his dog and one of his very young cousins, and also confessing to being in possession of real cp. He'd never confessed to anything like that when we were still talking to each other, but I still feel horrible for not stepping up and doing something sooner. I hope he rots in jail for being a genuinely disgusting human being.
I know I kind of drifted off but my initial question is still if this counts as grooming or abuse at all, since we were both minors when we first started dating and there's only a 2-3 year age gap. I'm really sorry if this seems like a stupid question, the last thing I want to do is to ridicule actual victims or make them look bad, I just feel like some other opinions would really help me out and possibly give me some clarity.

bbntlo,I need help identifying what I’m living. 35f married to 44m for 14 years. Yes I was 21 when I got married. 19 when I met him.,"It feels kinda gross now that I think about it. What 28 year old man goes for a 19 year old? He beat me up the first time when I was 20. I went back to him. He cheated and partied and I stayed. I got pregnant at 20 and kept the baby. We got married when I was 21. 

He raped me one night after I went out with my friends. That resulted in a pregnancy that he would not let me abort. After that baby I started cheating on him. The first time, he found out and bashed my face into the floor while my daughter watched. She remembers. When I went to my father-in-laws place for help he told me to go work it out. I had no support no matter where I turned. It was only him. 


He said if I really loved him I would have a 3rd child with him. So I did but nothing got better. I still cheated and he still tried to control me. He hasn’t hit me but he’s shown threats of violence by punching a hole in the wall or trying to break down the bathroom door to get to me. 


Now he follows me around the house yelling at me calling me names. My kids are growing up like this. I need help to leave because he has joked around in the past that if I ever leave him he will kill me.",codamama,2019-04-10 09:09:26,5,273,25.8,44.18,94.14,8.35,10.5,10.26,94.14,60.07,26.37,21.98,13.92,0.37,0,7.69,0,4.4,4.4,12.82,5.86,6.59,6.59,1.83,18.32,1.47,1.47,2.93,4.03,0,5.13,1.83,3.3,0.37,2.56,0,16.85,3.66,0.37,0.73,8.06,8.79,1.83,1.1,2.2,1.83,0.73,2.93,1.47,0.37,0.73,0.37,2.2,0.37,1.1,1.1,0,11.72,4.03,3.66,3.66,2.2,0.37,9.16,7.33,0.37,21.61,4.03,8.42,9.52,0.37,1.1,1.1,0,0,0.37,0.73,0,0.37,0.37,0,0,11.72,9.16,0.37,0,0,0.37,0,0.73,0,1.1,0,0
bbpncj,How to leave an abusive relationship with someone you love?,"Me (23F) and my boyfriend (36M) have been together for about a year and 4 months. I moved in with him about 6 months ago and pay half the rent and we split most bills.

About 4 months ago, he asked to go through my phone and went on my snapchat. I didn’t have anything bad, but I had some guys blocked (Id had my same snapchat since high school). When he seen this, he grabbed me by the hair and slapped me hard twice telling me to delete it. He pulled me off the couch and gave me his laptop since you have to delete it online. After I deleted it, I ran out of the house and drove away drunk. A block away, he called me saying he didn’t want me to drive drunk and that he would sleep on the couch. After I went back, he kept bringing up the blocked contacts. I told him that he hit me, and I didn’t feel comfortable and I went to the room and cried. The next morning he apologized and said how embarrassed he was and I forgave him.

After that, it all went down hill. I would be lying if I didn’t say there were red flags before that I ignored. He changed the way I dress, act, everything. I don’t have hobbies, all my friends and family are distant because I never see them anymore (he doesn’t want me to) or because they cant stand to see me like this. He tells me I have to wear eyeliner and mascara when we go hiking (even though I never would wear make up to work out/hike) when I questioned that, he said I looked lazy. So I started putting makeup on to hike. He told me I walked funny and showed me how to walk correctly, so now I try to walk the right way. All. The. Time. He said I should start doing squats “because he cares and is trying to help me”. He gives me advice for EVERYTHING (about work, clothes, ect.) and gets extremely mad when I don’t take it or do exactly what he wants. He doesn’t want me seeing my family because they want me to leave him. My jokes aren’t funny anymore, I’m always wrong. Everything I do is wrong. He will wake me up in the middle of the night to ask me why im drolling on the bed and to sleep with my mouth closed. He gets mad because in my sleep I mess up the sheets.

I have a friend at work who said I can go stay with her to just get my stuff and go but I cant bring myself to do it. Whenever I think about do it, this image comes to my mind: Waking up on Sunday morning around 9am, rolling over and cuddling with him and kissing him all over his face, especially his cheeks. I love his cheeks, there soft warm and they smell like him.

Im not myself anymore. I dress different, I laugh different, I drink all the time every night and smoke weed just to be happy with him, I hate how ugly hes made me. Weve both called each other names, like fucking idiot, lame ass, bitch, douchebag, asshole, everything. He tells me nobody is going to treat me as good as he does.

Please, anyone. Give me the best advice you can give a girl who is on the brink of leaving the abusive man she loves but needs a huge push.

Sorry for grammar, spelling, organization, im crying writing this. Thanks.

bbqzfn,I'm not crazy. [vent],"For two years, I heard the same two syllables no matter what I did. I stopped talking to people. I stopped doing things I loved. I stopped being me because ""You're crazy"". 

After a year of talking to my counsellor, I finally opened up about my ex today. ""You mention him every session but then you shut down."" I always have something to say about ""after what Evan did to me"". Not long after I started talking, she mentioned I might be having post traumatic reactions surrounding what had happened. Within the hour, we discussed the misogyny, the fact that I was sexually assaulted - a fact I never wanted to admit. 

It wasn't my fault I didn't want anal. It wasn't my fault it hurt. It wasn't my fault he stealthed me, or pretended to love me and attacked me instead, or that he disguised his racism as ""well it was just a joke, you're so sensitive"". 

I am allowed to want love from my boyfriend. I am allowed to want support from my boyfriend. I am allowed to open communication with him. I am allowed to be unhappy. I am allowed to tell him I'm hurt. 

It's not my fault. I am not crazy. And for the first time in two years, I am finally starting to believe it. 

It'll take a while. I'll still freak out, have flashbacks like I've been having. But after I'm done, I'll be the strongest fucking person I've ever known.

bbrivb,Was/Is this abuse?,"So sorry if I'm in the wrong sub I'm usually wrong so just tell me where if it's not here 

Anyways, so I am 18, almost 19, and my parents are, want I would consider, not great people. As a child they would yell at me and hit me -- albeit for lying or doing something stupid that kids do -- and then when I would start crying (I was a child and it hurt -- a lot) they would tell me to stop crying or they would give me something to cry about. As a result of the crying and my asthma being triggered by quick emotional changes, I would start having issues breathing and start gagging because I couldn't get air in and then they would yell at me that if I ""made myself"" throw up, then they would beat me more. But now, they deny they've never done that, despite me bringing it up. When I finally got sick of it and started yelling at my mother about it, she said ""so what if we did, you were different and normal parenting methods didn't work"" 

As I got older the hitting stopped but the yelling was more frequent, and I would start yelling back. A few years ago my dad and I got into a fight because I was hungry and asked if he was going to eat fish I would cook and he said no, and not wanting to be wrong, asked again (surprise asking again was wrong) and we ended up getting into a fight with him eventually just sitting on me, and afterwards telling my mother that as soon as I was 18 I was out of the house ""if he even makes it that far"" 

I have recently started having frequent nightmares of these events as well as certain noises (clapping/slapping and yelling) making it impossible to focus and I just instantly feel like I'm reliving everything all over again, which is what prompted me to ask here, as this sounds like PTSD but I've never been in a situation that would usually cause it until I saw it could be caused by abuse.

Also, I'm self harming myself again. It's because my anxiety is so great and it's a way i cope with what's happening at work and home.

But my parents said that if I cut again and they see the cuts that they'll take me to a residential treatment center again to get me help which'll cause me to lose my job.

How do I tell this new counselor I'm self harming without her telling my parents?

My counselor before told my parents stuff I didn't want my parents to know. 

I'm close to a relapse and I'm scared about everything..

Work, this girl is 16, I'm 18 and she is emotionally abusive to me too besides my parents. I try to ignore it or give her good comebacks, but how do I not let all this crumble my mental health again?

bbt9d2,Letter to my abusive father that I haven't seen in 5 years,"Clearly this was written a while back and I never really intended to do anything with it but I really need to get it off my chest 

Hi dad, father? Eddie? Mr [redacted[? 50% of my biological make up? I'm not really sure what to call you anymore but I think I'll stick with dad for now.

I often wonder how you've been, I really do hope you have been well. You may have been a really sucky person a lot of the time but I really wish you no Ill will. Its almost Christmas, I always feel guilty around this time. I can't help but think about the times you were a great dad but I know the bad outweighed the good and not seeing you was the best thing for me.

We haven't talked for a long long time, you would text me a lot and I would never reply because your texts were always so aggressive, I also can't stop thinking about the last text you sent me, ""just thought I'd tell you your uncle Robert died"" you sent that on boxing day 2016 and it still hurts you never even wished me a merry Christmas.

I know it would cause me horrible anxiety but I sometimes wish you would send a Christmas card or birthday card but I really don't expect you to.

I also can't get one of the last sentences you ever said to me out of my head ""I don't wanna be here with you, id much rather be with my friends at the pub, being with you is so depressing"" the rest of the night was a blur all I can remember was me crying hysterically as you laughed at me and then the screaming because I finally stood up to you.

I've been doing a lot better since I last seen you. Although you made the first year and a half a living hell by dragging me through court, no 12 year old should have to go through that. 

I was finally vegetarian because I could be, every time I would try to be you would trick me into eating meat. 

I came out as trans, I have no idea if you know but I have my suspicions you wouldn't like it as you loved to force me to wear girly things. Remember at Lucas's communion you told me I was an embarrassment to the whole family because I refused to wear 6 inch heels and a dress so short my underwear was visable, but I was only 10?

Me and my mum's relationship has been stronger since i no longer have you constantly telling me she is evil and all these other awful, untrue things you would tell me about her. To this day I can't walk past the police station since you went in when I was 6 and lied to them about my mum refusing to pick me up so they followed her up to your house and you forced me, a 6 year old, to watch my mum be followed by police.

I have a hamster, his name is salem. I love him so much but everytime I look at him my mind is flooded with flashbacks to when I forgot to tell you an appointment had been cancelled so you sold pikachu to make me Cry, which you found absolutely hilarious. Do you remember you told me you sold her as snake food? Do you remember the next time you seen me, 2 weeks later, that you only said that as a punishment? 

Do You know I can't go to [redacted] anymore because I'm absolutely terrified of running into you or your family? Do you know that if I see any bald man in the street I can't look at him or I'll have a full on panic attack on the off chance it's you, so everytime I see a bald man I have to cross the street. 

Every. Single. Night. My brain is just full of all the horrible things you said and done to me and I can't stop them. I have to live with these vivid flashbacks of everything you dome every single day and they hurt, they really really hurt. 

Y'know how papa died when I was 2? Well do you remember telling me he had left me money? I know you mist because my mum remembers. Do you remember when I asked about him leaving anything to anyone when I was 10 you lied straight to my face and told me he had left me nothing? You constantly told me my dead grandfather would be very disappointed in me but I'm starting to think that was you projecting. 

I now get to scared to tell someone if I've hurt myself. Since the day I asked you if you knew how I got any of the scars in my arms, since I've had them forever and dk how I got them, you accused me of doing them myself for attention and then decided a suitable punishment was to walk 4 miles in 30°c heat without a drink or a rest.

I've always wondered how things would be if you didn't hate my mum, if you didn't view me as my mum by proxy. Would your relationship be better? Would our relationship be better?
From the age of 3 I remember telling you to grow up and communicate with my mum bc you were both raising me, but you refused. You never acknowledged the consequences of refusing to talk to my mum, the most notable one being when I was four and fell and you forced me not to tell her, if I had told her maybe the issues bc of the fall could have been sorted earlier, maybe I wouldnt have had to get 8 teeth taken out.

There was a lot of things you forced me to not tell my mum and I don't think to this day I understand why. We had a lot of secrets, a lot of which were you messing up but being to stubborn to acknowledge it so I couldn't tell anyone. 

Sometimes I forget I don't have to do things that make me very uncomfortable to get something i want. Sometimes I do things I really don't want to get something small in return, because for as long as I can remember if I wanted something the only way i could get something i wanted was to kiss you, you know that made me uncomfortable that's why you bribed me.

Y'know the park directly across from your old flat in [redacted]? Do you remember the summer when we would go there a lot and and eat ice cream from the ice cream van? Do you remember that same summer you taught me how to swing on the swings by myself? I do. Its one of my happiest memories.
I go there whenever I'm feeling sad, it's such a calming place. I love being able to watch all the planes land and being able to see the city centre, especially at night and all the beautiful hills. Its all been done up recently but sometimes I close my eyes and im back to being that 6 year old again with a dad.



I know I blame so many of the things that 
happened to me on you, and I know some of it is unfair but I can't help but feel like my mental health would be a lot better if you hadn't have done what you done.",jassasson,2019-04-10 16:52:58,0,1275,13.62,54.68,90.26,10.8,22.77,11.14,94.2,63.61,24.47,20,11.92,0.31,6.12,1.02,0.63,4.47,5.1,11.45,11.22,6.43,8,2.75,21.57,3.53,1.73,1.57,1.88,2.2,4.78,1.8,2.98,0.86,1.02,0.71,14.12,1.57,0.08,1.25,1.49,17.96,3.37,2.75,3.22,3.84,2.2,4.63,2.12,1.18,0.39,0.55,2.2,0.94,0.31,0,0.63,5.41,1.49,0.71,2.2,1.33,0.31,8,10.9,0.86,13.1,1.57,4.78,6.9,0.39,0.47,0.24,0.31,0.31,0.24,0.78,0.08,0.16,0.16,0.16,0.16,11.06,3.06,2.67,0,0,1.25,0,0,0.31,3.14,0,0.63
bbtgl0,Sister in an Emotionally Abusive Relationship. Please Help!,"I am really desperate for advice. I know if I say the wrong thing, its all over.

My sister is in an incredibly emotionally abusive relationship. She has been dating this guy for about two years. I have been having talks with her for the last year or so about how what her boyfriend is doing is not okay. She goes above and beyond for this guy, even going so far as to attending Jehovah's witnesses meetings (she's catholic) to make him and his parents happy. Our mother was a reformed Jehovah's witness from a family of fanatics, so we have a long history of not feeling to kindly about that religion.

My sister shares a lot of things with me a lot, though I fear that will be coming to an end soon. Her relationship with her boyfriend started off sketchy as hell and got worse. Here are some things he did or made her do over the years:

Forbid her from talking to a ex who she was still best friends with
He went through her social media and made her delete pictures of her with other guys (like her drum line pics which were mostly all guys)
Went through her social media again and made her remove any picture with comments from ex's on them, even pictures of our dead mom.
Ignored her feelings about anything when she shared them and made it all about him. For example telling her she has no right to be upset because the way she is acting is making him upset.
Lying to her about what he has been doing, and when she calls him out on it turns it around and makes it her fault. For example she found out he lied about doing drugs with friends that he was STEALING from work (is a nurse) and somehow made it her fault.
Constantly demanded her attention, creating a rift between her and our dad because she is out of the house so much. My dad is was always strict about how often me and her were out of the house and how late, even for work purposes (implying that proper girls aren't out past 10), so you can image what happened when the boyfriend convinced my sister to stay out all night and come home in the morning some nights. As a disclaimer I do not always agree with my dad. He is too possessive. But that's another story.
Invited her over to spend quality time together without telling her he also invited all of his friends. Spent most of the time hanging out with said friends. Got upset when she was upset about this. Told her her feelings were unjustified.
Spent more time on his phone than interacting with her when they were together.
Constantly talked to his ex when he forbade my sister from talking to hers. My sister was okay with this, but the issues was that he had rules for her that he didn't follow himself.
That's just some of the issue. Last night is when shit really hit the fan. He allegedly broke up with her because it got back to him that she slept with someone else. From what I understand, she reconnected with an old friend when hanging out with her other friends. They drank a lot and she blacked out. She woke up naked with this guy in her car. Whether or not this constitutes as cheating or rape is a discussion for another day because I don't think she can handle it right now. But this guy she reconnected with went and told her boyfriend. Boyfriend demands that she leave work early and come over. Tells parents, mutual friends, and my sisters co-worker that she cheated on him. Starts throwing away all of their pictures in front of her and anything that might remind him of her. Says he can never be with her without thinking about this. It goes on for hours. He takes her phone away from her and calls me to talk to her because she wont leave. She hangs up on me a few times. I try calling and she hangs up. He calls me again and I finally talk to her. She is an emotional wreck, begging and pleading with him to stop. I finally, after ten minutes of talking to both of them convince her to drive to my house. I wait. She never comes. Finally she says he tells her she can't leave or its over. She never goes home. She calls in sick to work the next day because he told her to, then he leaves to go to his parents house???? at which point she goes home. I'm supposed to meet her tonight to talk. Our youngest sister informed me of the boyfriends list of demands to make them stay together. They include:

Being baptized a Jehovah's witness and stop celebrating holidays with the family. Cutting off contact with her long time friend because she is friends with the guys my sister ""slept"" with. Selling the car the other guy was in. Not taking the Vegas trip that is planned for this weekend. Deleting all of her social media. Changing her phone number.
When on the phone with her, she said multiple times that she was confused and didn't understand what was happening. She sounded half dead.

What can I do? I've talked to her so many times and nothing has changed. I'm wondering when I am going to be cut out of her life.",FirebirdiekinsXD,2019-04-10 17:12:18,0,931,37.37,94.86,6.76,5.31,14.11,15.79,94.63,60.58,22.77,17.08,3.54,0.54,0.11,12.03,0.86,5.69,4.08,16.33,7.63,6.23,7.3,1.93,16.76,2.79,1.29,2.47,0.43,2.47,4.08,1.07,3.01,0.75,0.97,0.11,24.49,2.04,2.58,9.99,5.16,10.53,1.5,2.58,0.11,2.69,1.4,3.11,1.93,0.54,1.07,0.32,1.07,0.43,0.43,0.21,0.11,9.77,5.37,1.29,2.15,0.75,0.64,6.02,9.67,0.97,16,3.22,6.02,7.09,0.64,0.86,0.97,0.54,0.43,0.21,0.75,0.21,0,0.32,0,0,12.24,6.77,1.83,0.21,0,0.54,0.11,0.11,0.21,1.61,0.86,0
bbtr87,Me(F20) with Partner(MtF19) of 4 years are in a coabusive relationship and I dont know how to fix it,"td;lr our relationship suffered because we were both fucked up teenagers but I want to improve now. Is it possible to fix this relationship and heal it? Or should i work on being independent? 

The first 2 years of our relationship was really toxic and I was the cause of a lot of the issues by wanting attention and breaking their things which ended up with them hurting me in some way. The past 2 years though ive realized I dont like who I am as a person. Ive worked on relearning mannerisms I was taught as a child and I'm going to therapy and trying to figure out how to become a stable, good person. Ptsd is hard thing to overcome and it doesnt help that I learned shitty behavior from mother/family. The only problem is I dont know what to do with our current relationship. 

About a year ago I was almost strangled to death by my partner three times and then I had to stop working because my depression and anxiety had gotten so bad I was a mess of a person who couldnt leave the house without having a panic attack. Ive relied on my partner for income for the past year but ive recently been trying to become more independent (ive got a job interview on Friday). 

Ive told my partner that maybe we should ease into an open relationship and get a small house so we can both have our own space and such. They said that was fine and such. The problem is........ I find it hard to be around them sometimes. I want this relationship to work out but.... When they get upset or loud (playfully) I get so scared and I've tried talking to them about it (+ what's happened in the past), but they say that theyve moved on from that and that I should learn to move on from it too. 

How do I move on from almost being killed by the ONLY person I love and trust? 

Is it possible to grow from this? Is it possible to heal our relationship if both people put in the effort? Or should i just work on trying to be more independent and improving myself

bbvlft,Memories of my brother’s abuse have re-populated my mind. Am I overreacting? Was any of this normal?,"Last month, my grandfather died. “Gramp” was an incredible man who will be missed so very much. He was the best of us — a man who loved his wife, never missed a day of work in life, and provided his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren with memories and lessons that will never fade. 

After his funeral, we celebrated his life at my older brother Clyde’s newly purchased house, which also happens to be just a few blocks away from our childhood home. I grew up in a family of six: my parents, my sister, and my two brothers. I was the “middle child,” the second of three boys. My sister is about ten years older than Clyde. Our father died two years ago. 

I respect the man my older brother has shaped into. I love him and want the best for him at all times, despite his narcissistic tendencies. He’s blowing me out of the water in the “game” of life and is not afraid to showcase it. I don’t even feel like I’m playing. 

Suffering the loss of two of the most important men in our lives has evoked endless childhood memories, some good and bad. The bad are rough flashbacks to moments where I felt extreme emotional distress. The source of the pain was almost always Clyde’s harsh bullying. 

Clyde picked on me and nobody ever did anything about it. My father was handicapped and absent for the majority of our lives. My mother kept things afloat by working several jobs at once. 

Clyde’s favorite nickname for me was “faggot.” His most frequently used adjective was “fat,” even though I was quite skinny throughout the entirety of my youth. 

I remember when things got really tough. My sister was on her own by this time. We were poor and had to move in with our grandparents for about a year, using the two unused rooms upstairs in their home. My Mom, younger brother, and Clyde slept in one and I had to sleep in the other alone. 

Clyde just would not stop making fun of me and attacking my appearance, likes and interests, smell, etc. He hated me and wasn’t afraid to say so. I never fought back but instead begged him to stop. I would shove my face in a pillow and scream blood-curdling howls of distress to try to show him how much it was hurting me.

My grandfather was big into photography and had many disposable cameras laying around the house. One day, Clyde flipped the script and told me that I looked good. He insisted on taking a picture of me in a pose with my legs crossed and a smile on my face. I really didn’t want to do it, but he absolutely assured me that he was being genuine. 

I knew he wasn’t but still agreed, maybe with hopes that playing along would get him to like me. Maybe this could’ve been a really funny moment for all of us (my little brother was playing his usual role as spectator). He snapped the photo and immediately laughed at me, calling me a faggot, saying he would keep the photo as proof of my gayness after the film was developed. I was 11 years old at this time. 

Back then, I would isolate and create my own “worlds” by drawing comic books, playing with action figures, and binging video games. I felt safe in solitude, where I could be unbothered and express my interests to an audience of no one. I kept binders filled with comics. I created my own series of characters whose stories would intersect frequently. I would improve as a writer/illustrator over time. I would tease future editions and end on cliffhangers. Nobody read them, except me. I was proud of my stories and planned to release them someday despite my insecurities. I hid them behind my grandfather’s pool table in the basement.

One day, like any other, I went downstairs to retrieve and revise my work. There was nothing to improve upon, because Clyde ripped everything to shreds and spit on the pile of fiction. A piece of me had been killed. To this day, I don’t think I’ve drawn anything that wasn’t for an art class assignment at school. I still don’t know what Clyde’s motive was for desecrating my beloved hobby, other than perhaps pure contempt. 

In those years, Clyde’s verbal attacks worsened as he started to understand what truly caused me to tick. Repetition and fast-talking were my main bugaboos. I had frequent ear infections as a baby/toddler and needed tubes. Sounds could get under my skin and actually cause what I perceived as physical pain. Misophonia is what it’s called, I believe. Clyde knew this and went on the offensive. 

“Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot. Fatfaggot.” 

His mouth was machine gun and his words pierced my well-being. I’d crawl into a ball and cover my ears. He’d beat me around and spit on me for doing that. My younger brother would team up with him on occasion. That’s when I’d feel truly alone, because he was usually an ally of sorts. 

Our “playing doctor” moment came a few years before all of this. Clyde dared me to do something to my “ally” that we both very much did not want to do. We caved at the threat of harm from Clyde, and when it was done, he referred to me as a “rapist.” He’d pull that one out when all of the other insults had been exhausted. 

Later on, towards the teenage years, Clyde did a couple of things to me that I just cannot seem to remove from my memory bank. One of them was on the bus after school. I would obviously sit as far away from Clyde as I could, unless the bus was too full. I remember being forced to sit near him and some of his friends, including a girl he liked. I told them I was his brother. None of them knew and were stunned. I wore thick glasses and didn’t play sports. Clyde had 20/20 vision and could throw the ball a mile. When we got off the bus and walked towards the apartment we were living in at the time, Clyde stopped me, told me to never do it again, and proceeded to beat the shit out of me as others, some my friends, walked by. 

The other was when he found my “time capsule”  that I buried in the woods. In the capsule, I wrote something that expressed my dreams to become an actor. Clyde shamed and humiliated me for this. He shredded what I had written and punched me. I’ve never taken any steps towards becoming an actor. 

 I would eventually move away from my mother and two brothers to live with my father for a couple of years. Though I probably spent far too much time alone during those years, my life improved and I even started an award-winning podcast at the age of 15. Dad moved away, forcing me back to my mother’s “custody” for the rest of high school. I missed a lot, apparently, because now Clyde was his own worst enemy. He was a drug addict, a punk, and a crook. Things got bad fast. Him and I hardly ever spoke a word unless he was asking me for something (I almost always said yes). 

Everything came to a head one very traumatic day. Clyde was high and barged into my bedroom. He was about 18 at this point and I was 16. I didn’t understand much about the drugs at the time, but I knew something was off. He was being incredibly nice and talkative to me. We spent a few hours playing video games and chatting. He kept getting up, walking around, scratching himself and talked manically. Even though I knew he wasn’t himself and that this wouldn’t last, I pathetically went along with things and tried treating this as a much-needed bonding moment. 

Eventually, we had to go pick my mother up from work (sometimes she let Clyde have the car for the day). I had my license and could drive, and begged Clyde to let me. He was getting more and more manic, almost as if the high had a second wave. Reluctantly, he agreed and tossed me the keys.

As soon as my mother saw us both in the car, she knew something was wrong. We picked up some dinner and headed home. She knew Clyde was high. 

We got home and instead of eating, my mother called him out. Clyde flipped out and was now violently out of control, screaming at her and making her cry. He stole the keys and took off in her car. I unsuccessfully tried to stop him. My poor mother cried and didn’t know what to do. Clyde sped off in a way that made me think he was about to crash and die. I paced outside in the apartment complex parking lot, unsure if I should call the police. I phoned my father a thousand miles away and he told me that he couldn’t help. I decided to call 911. Clyde did end up coming back safe and was arrested. 

I’m not so sure why I did this, but I walked up to Clyde when he was in the back of one of the police cars. I told him that his incarceration would be justice for EVERYTHING. He spat at me. Most of it missed.

All of this happened a few days before my older sister’s wedding. My brothers and I were in the wedding, and Clyde had to be there no matter what. It would’ve been ruined without him. Charges were pressed, so Clyde was in the slammer for several days. His bail was around $1,100. 

My sister and I went half-and-half to get him out. He made the wedding, at which we had zero dialogue regarding the preceding events. 

Today, Clyde has been sober for nearly a decade. His comeback has been nothing short of a miracle. He makes more money than anyone I know, and he didn’t even attend college. He’s the shining star of the family who doesn’t wear diapers. 

I’m one of the, if not the, biggest disappointment. Much of my family expected great things from me when I was younger. Some thought I’d be able to do whatever I wanted. My grandfather was one of them. 

I want the wounds to heal, but feel as if they can’t without an apology of some sort from Clyde. He is my brother. I will always love him. But I saw shrinks as a child because of his cruelty. Perhaps the “unnatural” end of our childhood relationship was on my side. Maybe it’s harsh to pin the blame on him, considering that Clyde was a kid too. He should’ve been stopped and punished by an adult.",shake_flock,2019-04-10 20:56:22,8,1850,47.93,45.9,58.72,15.82,12.5,15.3,91.3,57.51,19.24,14.86,9.08,1.14,0,4.16,0.49,4.38,5.84,14.38,9.03,4.97,6.7,1.95,17.3,4.76,2.43,1.41,1.84,2.43,6.11,2.65,3.35,0.54,1.03,0.92,11.84,2.49,0.27,1.19,5.24,11.78,2.16,1.3,1.95,2.59,1.57,2.81,2.16,0.65,0.59,0.81,2.54,0.97,1.14,0.05,0.38,8.65,3.24,1.41,2.65,1.19,0.92,9.62,4.81,0.59,14.38,1.73,6.76,6.27,1.51,1.89,0.76,0.38,0,0.32,0.32,0.16,0,0.11,0.05,0,17.03,7.89,4.22,0.05,0,0.11,0,0.49,1.41,2.32,0.32,0.22
bbvxcp,"Having trouble coping, looking for resources","I need some reading recommendations, but first...

Some information on me and my situations:

I've been in two mentally and emotional abusive relationships. I've been in six physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive friendships. Not always all types at once, but some overlapped. This post would be say too long if I got into this specifics of each one. And some heavy school bullying from my grade school years. And some traumas from unrelated sources along the way, cause why not?

I have some mental illnesses. Some are genetic like my depression and anxiety, which my grandmother was so generous to pass down to me. And I have borderline personality disorder, which my psych attributes to my stressful childhood. But, I try to never let myself to take out my aggression on my friends. I'm very patient and forgiving with my friends and loved ones, because I know what it feels like to struggle. And how it feels to be alone when you are suffering. I try to make sure no one I care about has to go through that. I'm fiercely loyal and bond quickly with people, I've never been one to turn away from situations I thought I could save. 

I know the mental illnesses and my forgiving nature have contributed greatly to my abuse, I know that. But I never want to just stop being kind, understanding, and patient. I want to give people the benefit of the doubt. There are so many kind people in the world that deserve it. 

But I struggle a lot with the why of everything. Why did they hurt me? Why me? Why does this keep happening to me? I know it's not my fault, but I can't stop wondering, what I ever did to deserve these things in my life? How do these people (monsters?) keep finding me? What is it that I'm doing?

A lot of people are quick to dismiss it as my mental illness destroying my relationships. A lot of people say that I'm lying or exaggerating. If you are either, please don't comment. I've got a therapist, a psychiatrist, and a small, intimate support structure. I've discussed these things with all of them at fear of being the wrong one, with fear of deserving the treatment I've recieved. They have assured me that that is not the case.  

I'm having a lot of trouble processing my experiences and I keep getting stuck on the why, why, why of it all.  Does anyone have any good resources, websites, books, anything that they can reccomend to me? Bonus points for anything that includes mental illness in the discussion, since I I have it lol.

bbyfo7,Sharing this as a form of therapy ig? Also for anyone else who is going/went through it,"I didn't know where else to put this so this is where it ended up. My two closest friends and family members know, and support and help me when things get rough and listen to me when i vent, but I just feel like I should put my experience out here. Partly as a way to vent and just have it out there, but also because when I looked for people similar to me, I couldn't find much, so I hope this helps anyone in my shoes. 

So, backstory. I had a pretty fucked childhood, surprise surprise. My early childhood was mainly just being bulled and having no friends and I'm not 100% sure why. The schools around there sucked, so did the people, I was pretty overweight too, and more things so I can't really say, but I still have some stuff from that. Mostly though it starts around when I was like 8? My mom and I moved out of my Gma's house and into this small ass town and I went to two schools there, both private Christian schools and the bullying was way worse there. Same reasons, plus the fact my mom was raising me by herself. Also I was around 230+ lbs. Short version, I was beat up once, got bullied, and had one friend but then she moved away. Out of school, my mom had a boyfriend who would tease me repeatedly for my weight and pinned me to the floor once which scared the shit out of me and beat my mom once when I was asleep, they broke up after that (Btw he used to be in the military). My father wasn't better, he's was/is an alcoholic and I saw him beat his girlfriends in front of me multiple times. And yes they weren't good to me either since one said I looked pregnant once and called me an entitled brat when she though I was sleeping (I was still around 8 btw). I still would never have wished to see them get hurt like that by him though. Anyways, throughout all this my mom was a drug addict and I had to stop her from doing dangerous shit all the time among other shit. Sometimes she would be too out of it and I would just eat bread plain bc I couldn't open the canned food we had an it was the only thing we had. One time I went out to get groceries bc my cousin was with us and I felt responsible if we didn't have food but then a police officer had to bring me home and I was the one blamed for trying to get food and being left home alone.

Anyways, this end part is where things start to get better so maybe this will show that things don't stay horrible forever. I finally had enough and switched to online school and begged for us to move back with my Gma and we did. I stayed in that school for 2 years and during that time I didn't talk to anyone my age, or really anyone. However, I did lose the weight and I told myself that once I did I would go back to school and try to make friends. I did and then begged for us to move back out to another house we have that was very far away. We did and it was the summer when we got there and since I've only had one friend and that didn't last long I was nervous and would literally look up how to speak to people and basically how to be normal? I went and I tried to speak to people but I couldn't find out how, literally. I went months w/o friends and I would wonder what was wrong with me, but eventually I found a group of people I am still friends with and they really helped me socialize and learn what was normal and what wasn't. I know that sounds weird but when you've never had friends you really don't know how to act or what to do or say and it really leaves you feeling almost alienated and degraded in a way. My mom still was/is a drug addict and that still hurts and is difficult to deal with but my friends and living with my family really helped and I'm in a way better place emotionally and mentally. Not that I still don't have anxiety or sometimes disassociate. I'm still forced to visit my father but I've gotten better at dealing with him while I'm there. I don't see either of them getting better but their health isn't the best so I just try to look out for myself while being near them and trying to make of it what I can so I can sleep at night.

Yeah, that was really long, but what I want to say to people who never really had friends or whose both side of the family was fucked or who was overweight as a kid or who had to deal with fucked up boyfriends/girlfriends of parents or who still live with fucked up parents that things get better. You will learn to make friends, you will lose the weight if you want to, you will find people who help you, even if you have to be around those fucked up parents for now you can still heal and things will not stay the same forever.",OkiOkiBell,2019-04-11 03:52:14,0,934,9.65,30.36,90.61,12.88,25.94,9.1,96.25,64.67,20.34,13.81,9.74,1.07,1.07,1.18,0.75,6.53,3.32,12.74,11.24,9.31,11.88,2.46,21.09,4.18,2.36,3.32,1.82,1.5,4.82,1.93,2.89,0.43,1.18,0.64,11.67,1.71,1.61,1.18,1.07,13.38,1.61,1.71,1.93,3.32,0.96,5.67,2.78,0.86,0.86,0.96,3.75,0.86,1.39,0.64,1.28,9.53,4.07,1.82,2.46,2.03,0.75,9.1,9.53,1.18,14.99,2.03,6.75,6.85,1.18,0.43,0.75,0,0.11,0,2.03,1.07,0.54,0.21,0,0.21,10.71,3.43,3.21,0,0,0.32,0,0,0,2.68,0.43,0.64

The problem I think is my mom. My friends and boyfriend think that my mom is emotionally abusive. She is regularly insulting me and how I look, dress, act, etc. She tracks me and my driving on my phone and I am 17 years old and I have to tell her where I am at all times. She and I have a rocky relationship bc she has severe depression and i’m really the only person she talks to bc my dad and her hate eachother. My dad told me that our family is broke and he hasn’t told anyone besides me and we are both terrified of my moms reaction when she finds out. I’m afraid of her and so are most of my friends. Her behavior is very erratic and I never know which version of her I will get. I don’t know if this is the best place to post this and if anyone needs any more details about my mom I will add them, I just want to know if this is emotional abuse?

bc077t,Sharing art/poems about abuse?,"Hi everyone, as someone who has suffered from abuse throughout my childhood, I always used art and poetry to express the feelings I could not express to people. Unfortunately, I received only bad reactions because my art and poems were so dark. And that was true - they were incredibly dark. So I hid all these ""dark"" thoughts and realities from new friends, because I didn't want them to know how ""dark"" I could be or was. But now I am starting to realize that this actually makes it so much more difficult for people to know how normal their ""dark"" thoughts are, and I am contemplating sharing my art.

I wanted to ask a couple of questions for those who don't mind sharing their thoughts on this:  
1. I want to create new art to empower people who have went through abuse, but do you think that this can actually be empowering? Because I am mainly scared it might be depressing or triggering, rather than helping. 

2. Do you read/look at poems and art that are more ""depressing"", and if so, is this something you find helpful?

&amp;#x200B;

I think part of the reason I am asking is because part of me really wants to share, but at the same time, I am scared that I will feel rejected when sharing vulnerable material.

He is a heroin/crack addict that gets high minimum twice a week and constantly takes her to seedy places and made her try heroin once and she vomited profusely and was sick for days. When he’s high he barks at her like a dog and beats her and when she locks herself in a room he just breaks the lock and continues to hurt her. The next day he’d just change the locks and pretend like nothing happened despite her being covered in bruises. He doesn’t let her hang out with friends or have a job and says he’ll fully support her despite him spending all his money on drugs. He still lives with his mother who is also a pill popper and an enabler that has never tried to make him stop abusing drugs or helped my friend when she was being beaten. Her ex went to prison for a few months for the heroin and she was finally back and seemed so happy to finally be free of him but she went back to him as soon as he got out and we didn’t talk for about 2 months. She came back recently but went right back to him a few days later. About a week ago I had to kidnap her from his house and take her to a women’s shelter just so she could get away from him. Now she’s talking about how she still loves him and wants to go back. Every time she leaves he always threatens to kill him self and won’t stop messaging her. I don’t know what more I can do to show her that this dude is pure evil and that she will be miserable forever is she keeps going back to him.

bc16yb,"@bomimis is a racefaking, koreaboo, predator","https://bomihateclub.tumblr.com

the links will tell you alone how disgusting bomi is and how they've treated minors and their friends alone. they can tell whatever story they want and act as if their experiences growing up made them this way and excuses their behavior, but it truly doesn't. bomi has race faked as being black, lied about it continuously from saying their parents are black, their parents DON'T identify as black, their great grandparent was black, and etc. they jumped back and forth continuously with the identity. if you've ever seen bomi, you can tell that they're not black and i'm sure Bomi can see this themself. They were even adamant about getting a dna test to PROVE themselves to be black, which is already... suspicious to say the least given their previous statements of ""Knowing"" they're black. They've also used slurs and engaged in black-only discussions and even had to look up black slurs because they were unfamiliar with them and admitted to even doing this because they wanted to ""fit in"" (as they mentioned being apart of a black groupchat). Bomi is clearly lying as they revealed to friends that they've grown up as a white puerto rican.

Now onto them being predatory. they made a gc with nudes and sent them to people who had just turned 18 and were still young. Bomi is predatory because they had told a friend of mine that they were crushing on someone, and it's been for months. Mind you this person is only 17 at the time. When talking to someone else about this, Bomi lied and said they only started crushing on them when they turned 18 which is not true and is still off. Plus the way they've talked to minors is truly disgusting and passive aggressive and should not be done by an adult whatsoever. This is also all done while they're in a relationship with their boyfriend. Bomi is also polyamorous and has told friends they've failed to tell their boyfriend because they're ""not ready"" which would constitute as cheating. They've also had their boyfriend message the people involved to try and guilt trip them and forgive Bomi for their ugly actions.

Onto them being a koreaboo, Bomi has mentioned meeting their boyfriend on hellotalk and wanting to become an english teacher in korea. That was all well and fine, until they started dropping korean phrases randomly and demonstrating these things without being asked to nor prompted. 

Bomi is also a freeloader, as their boyfriend works apparently while Bomi has not done anything to help whatsoever, and is still in some sort of contact with their mother (?) as they have received money from them. They've talked before about spending money on wigs and clothing which is all good and fine, but then begging money for rent. It seemed very suspicious. 

Bomi has also entered discussions policing people, as noted on how they have talked over asian people on their previous blog and inserted them when not needed nor necessary. Bomi has LIED to over 30+ people while simultaneously hurting them. Bomi is not someone to trust nor are they okay by any means. This is a warning for the next people coming into contact with Bomi.

I am conducting a study on domestic violence and custody. The study consists of a 60-minute interview and there is a $25 compensation provided at the conclusion of the interview.

I am a 23-year-old woman. I was a hotline Counsellor at the Boston Area Rape Crisis Centre. The interview will end with a debrief and safety planning discussion in order to ensure that the interviewee will have the necessary tools for self-care and an infrastructure of support.

Interview participants must have children, whether biological or adopted. The relationship does not have to be recent and the violence experienced doesn’t need to be physical. There are no gender or sexuality requirements. I simply want to listen to your story. I hope this research can be used to influence how the legal systems and non-profit organisations can better help domestic violence survivors.

bc6ve3,I think my (35f) ex-boyfriend (34m) has been emotionally abusive and I can’t work out if it’s deliberate or the result of mal adjusted coping mechanisms. I’m having trouble letting go.,"TL;DR! I’m having a hard time deciphering if my ex boyfriend is battling demons and has the capacity to change, or if I should cut him off completely. 

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I’m a single mum, I left my husband of 10 years (together 16) over 2 years ago when I’d finally had enough of his gaslighting, stonewalling and contempt. This is a man who told me I was ruining his holiday because I was placed on bed rest by the doctor as I was threatening miscarriage. It’s taken me years of therapy, growth and self love to get myself past this and into a great space mentally. And I’m proud of myself. That was not easy. Not in the slightest. 

I’ve worked to be 100% independent, both mentally and financially. I have 50% custody of my kids, and due to the work I’ve done on myself I have an amicable relationship with their father. I’m not longer a victim in my own eyes. My kids come first. And life is so so amazing. 

I’ve struggled in the past with seeing my value and worth. I’ve had a string of failed romances where I’ve been used, which I feel is related to my inability to value myself. 

A while back, after finding out I had been the other woman and there was a baby on the way I decided to take no more bullshit from myself. I determined my worth. I was not going to allow anyone into my life who wasn’t going to respect that. 

I spent quite some time alone - when I met a guy I’d come across in online dating before. Let’s call him Tony. 

We hit it off immediately. Despite both of us not wanting anything serious we were almost inseparable from the beginning. He was kind. Loving. He touched me. He actually touched me. It was like a whole new world. Someone who was interested in me. Who I was. Who loved my quirks and celebrated them instead of putting them down. It was sensational. I fell hard and fast. 

I noticed early on that he seemed to have an over inflated sense of self. It’s weird but I picked up that he believed he should be treated a certain way by people. Which isn’t unreasonable in itself, but his remarks were kinda a bit unrealistic. It’s like he deserved to be treated a certain way no matter what his actions were. For example he asked early on, if my kids would get him a Father’s Day present. He clearly wanted to be a dad to them. Which is adorable but at the same time not his place. They have a father. One they adore. I wanted more than anything to have a family unit and in time I was more than happy for him to be a step dad. But he will never take the place of their father. He can’t. He lamented that in a past relationship he had taken her kids to get their dad a Father’s Day present but received nothing in return on the day. 

I didn’t feel that I was able to have this conversation with him. I told him that the kids father and I co parent. And that there was a place for him in their lives. And that they celebrate and appreciate anyone who has given them guidance on that day (their grandfathers). We were also 9 months away from Father’s Day. It just all seemed a little self centred to me. 

I’ve got a few friends from my online dating days who I’m still in contact with. Most were only ever friends. Two were a bit more. One guy in particular played a pivotal role in me learning to value myself. He took me to a ball. Slept in my bed and didn’t once touch me inappropriately or request anything from me. His motives were that he just wanted to spend time with me as a friend. I still talk to him and I had him saved in my phone as first name - Bumble. As I met him on bumble. I never needed to change it. It was like a cute nick name. The third time Tony commented on the fact I hadn’t changed the last name, I twigged that he didn’t like it and asked if he had a problem. And it went from there. Apparently I was disrespecting him.  I told him that I hadn’t realised this, however I needed to think this through. I’m not going to change it because I’m forced too. He didn’t come to bed that night. So I left the next day. Then I got the message “I’m sorry, you can have whatever name you want it’s your choice I love you and I want us to be happy”.  He has since reneged on this telling me I’m disrespecting him by keeping the name that way. I had changed it but didn’t get the chance to tell him. 

I changed the name. I’m not that petty. I don’t want to hurt anyone inadvertently or otherwise 

Things were great again. Until NYE about 2 months in. He was drunk. And wouldn’t kiss me. I asked him why. He went quiet. Indignant. Wouldn’t talk. I had no idea what was going on. He asked me not to nag him (a pet hate from previous relationships). He went back to our table and acted normal leaving me in tears. We caught an Uber home. He wouldn’t come inside. Wouldn’t go to bed. Just completely unreasonable. 

The next day he sheepishly apologised. 

My birthday was mid January. I had an amazing day. It was phenomenal. Spoilt to the nth degree. We were out dancing. I was drunk, he was plastered. I hugged an old school friend and his jealousy struck. I told him it was a high school acquaintance. Nothing more. When we got home I said that he needed to work on his jealousy. That wasn’t fair to me and he went off. Berated me. Told me I was disgusting. Told me he just never knew who I had slept with. I was in shock. Where has my amazing and sweet man gone. I told him I would not be slut shamed in my own house. I have no regrets, except for not respecting myself as much as I should. He cracked it and drove home drunk. 

The next day he asked if there was any coming back from this. That he was hopelessly in love with me. 

I told him that I’m not interested in staying anywhere that my self worth and value are stripped from me. And that I expect this behaviour will not continue. He promised to cut back drinking and to get help. 

Then we went out with friends for another birthday party a week later. One where I was supposed to be shouted. But I knew he had no money. He had been layed off late December and hadn’t started work yet. I’d been buying groceries and doing meal prep for both of us and paying for outings for a few weeks. I ended up paying for my birthday dinner too. That night I drove home. He was drunk. And he layed into me about my parenting. How I coddled my kids. And I didn’t let them play games. How I seemed to be inconsistent with what I let them do. (My parenting is very much a mix because they have different things in different houses and I’m trying as much as I can to give them balance, so I have a low tech household, and they get technology very sparingly, same with junk food but occasionally I will treat them). 

The next day it was the same. He said sorry. He said I was an amazing parent. That I do so much for those around me. 

I let this slide. I let it all slide. Despite this type of thing being on my deal breaker list. I felt like I was being unreasonable to call it over this. Especially with how amazing it was to begin with. 

There were other things too. It was impossible to ask that he turn lights off (my summer credit was all used up on him having the air con on all night meaning I’m going to be behind on my with her bill unless I pay more) or to put his dishes in the dishwasher. Or put his shoes away. There was always an excuse. And when I wouldn’t put up with the excuse I wasn’t listening to his point of view. But this is all pretty normal relationship stuff right. I am very particular about my house. Maybe I am asking too much. I left it. 

We were going ok until a bucks/hens weekend for some of my friends. A winery tour and then party. I was anxious about him being drunk. I verbalised this. He reassured me it would be fine. It wasn’t. 

We were walking home to our accom around 10. I was walking ahead. A bit annoyed I had to wait for him. I wasn’t feeling well at all. He noted I was two steps ahead. I told him that I’d waited 25 minutes for him and I needed a bathroom. 

He. Went. Off. Called me a POS. Threw his phone. Walked off in the other direction. Called me to ask me WTF is wrong with me. Berated me in messages. It took me 3 hours to get him back to the hotel. I had no idea where he was. Just a string of texts. Finally I found him, and he wouldn’t get in the car. I pretended to call his mum and he lunged at me. I’ve never been so petrified in all my life. 

The next day we went home. He went to his house. I put all his shit in the garage for him to collect. 

He apologised again. Told me he would see someone. He had an appointment with his GP to get the ball rolling, and he promised not to drink. At first he said cut back. But I was steadfast on abstinence. He danced around it but eventually agreed. I thought maybe he was actually making an effort. So I stuck by him. 

But I kept him at arms length. 3 weeks go by and I haven’t let him be around the kids. We had been on a few dates. He cooked me dinners. He was making an effort and I was really struggling to forgive him. I wasn’t sure if I could trust him. Sure he was making an effort but let’s face it, this was the 4th time it had happened in 4 months and each time it got worse. 

He was also telling me it was alcohol. That’s it. That’s the problem. He lacks insight into his mindset. And of course he doesn’t remember much so to him it all seems a bit like an over reaction on my behalf. 

My grandmother passed away last week. He left me the day after she died. Citing that he wasn’t happy. That I didn’t realise the impact I had on him by kicking him out. He continued despite me telling him I wasn’t emotionally equipped to deal with this. 

He told me that I wasn’t justified kicking him out. 

He came over to get his stuff. We had discussions. He said a few things about what had transpired that night, one of them being “you walked off on me, I was lost” implying that I deserved to be talked to and treated like that. 

He also told me that by mentioning past tinder dates in the beginning (before we were together but he would twist that into after we were a couple) planted the seed for jealousy that caused the blow up on my birthday, again implying it was my fault. 

He then berated me about that over text even though we’ve previously discussed it and he has apologised for his behaviour. I even went out and bought a new bed just for us. To help with this. 

He decided we were on a break. He needed space. He would contact me almost constantly as before and then get shitty if I didn’t reply. In amongst all this I had a family wedding interstate. I had a lot going on and by this point I was numb. Just numb. 

Finally he accused me of having my walls up. I said yes. He left me the day after my grandmother died. Of course I have walls up. I asked him for space. He told me that he left me because I treated him like dog shit for 4 weeks and everything was always on my terms. I wished him the best and he told me to go get some help. 

I ended up blocking him. He had been making remarks about posts I had liked or the fact I turned off my ‘online status’. 

I guess I’m conflicted because this is nothing like my marriage was. I’m torn between thinking he is just like my ex, or he is just struggling with actually having to grow up and be responsible for his actions. He can be so sweet. So kind. So loving. I was so so so happy. How did it get to this?

He even admits to the pain he has caused and how sorry he is, so I think that there is hope, and then he shuts it down and throws it back on me. Tells me that I’m ridiculous with my thought processes, that it’s madness and how unreasonable I am. How I’m not willing to compromise. He tells me I’m simply not ready to have someone in my life and he says I need to get help. 

Was there anything I could have done to support him more? Where did I fall down? Is there a chance he can sort himself out and we can be happy?

How can I get over this and move forward. I feel like I’ve lost my future. He was going to move in. We were going to get married.",throwawayhsishdhsjak,2019-04-11 16:44:59,6,2393,19.95,49.33,66.82,38.39,9.85,12.54,93.65,62.81,25.41,19.43,10.82,1.09,0.21,6.52,0.79,5.98,4.55,13.16,11.24,4.97,6.31,2.55,20.1,3.64,1.96,1.42,1.04,1.88,4.93,2.8,2.09,0.29,0.63,0.54,15.84,1.09,0.54,0.33,7.1,11.24,1.67,1.67,1.92,2.21,1.42,3.68,1.42,0.21,0.59,0.5,1.71,0.38,0.46,0.04,0.71,7.35,3.22,1,1.92,1.25,0.42,10.45,7.44,1.04,15.88,3.22,7.1,6.02,0.92,1.13,0.92,0.63,0.04,0.08,0.5,0.25,0.08,0.08,0.04,0,15.8,9.95,1.17,0,0.04,0.17,0.04,0.13,0.21,3.3,0.67,0.13
bc87ml,Abused/kicked out stories?,"I’m making this post to try and reach out to people who can relate and offer advice. I’m also really interested in hearing other people’s experiences, so please blow this post up if possible. All thoughts and comments are welcome though. This is gonna be kind of a long post, so please bear with me. L

Before I get into the abuse i suffered as a kid at the hands of my parents, I wanted to kind of describe myself a little bit when I was still a kid.
I was always a very bright and precocious child. Straight A’s without trying, advanced courses, winning spelling bee’s and reading bee’s left and right. While my parents dogged my brother about his grades, they went to tons of assemblies to watch me succeed. Before the fighting got really bad, I interacted with my peers all the time. I wasn’t the most extroverted kid, but  nobody really disliked me, since I always had something witty to say. I kept a tight group of 2 or 3 friends and that was all I needed. Always did well in school without even trying... and now that I’ve been living on my own going to college for 3 years, I can barely be fucked to do the minimum amount of coursework to pass my classes. I actively avoid talking to my classmates whenever possible, and have only made 1 friend from my classes. I wake up dreading to have to get out of bed, and I go to bed dreading having to wake up. I smoke weed or drink almost every single night because I’m tired of being sober and listening to my self-deprecating thoughts all the time. 

Ok, time for the actual body of this post:
I have been living on my own for about 3 years now, ever since I graduated high school. I never got along very well with my parents or brother and for pretty much the entire time I was in high school we did nothing but fight all the time. My mom had some pretty impulsive anger issues and that often caused fights to get physical or end with destroying something of mine (usually expensive). My dad didn’t have the same level of anger issues, but he would never stop my mom once she got into a rage.

These fights we got into often started off pretty innocent (not doing dishes, taking a pop out of the fridge without asking) but would spiral out of control since both sides would constantly add more fuel to it without trying to defuse the situation. I was by no means an “easy child”,  but by comparing my punishments with some of my friends’ I know I wasn’t a wild child either. I once had a steak knife thrown at me for a fight that started over cleaning my room. If I hadn’t used my laptop to defend myself, I probably would have been impaled (she broke my laptop without paying for it, but given the circumstances I guess I’m lucky). Some of the weirder and more extreme punishments are listed here:

1) I was pulled off of academic quiz team right before our final competition, because I “enjoyed it too much” and they “had no other way to punish me”. I think this was after I refused to sit with them at one of the marching band banquets, and chose to sit with my friends instead

2) I had my ping pong table flipped in half right in front of me for mouthing off about staying out after curfew

3) pulled off of a marching band spring break vacation that I had already paid for myself. My mother then used the 1000$ I lost as an incentive to behave, then never gave it back.

4) grounded and sequestered to my room (without a door) for 4 months. No screens, no friends, not even a book left in my room and a major ass beating to top it all off. It was actually the worst 4 months of my life. All because I got caught smoking weed.

These are just the examples that come to mind immediately. There’s a shit ton of others that I’m sure I can’t remember, as well as a lot of more usual behaviors out of excessively strict parents.

Needless to say I tried not to interact with them whenever possible. Also, my mom loved to talk shit about me to the extended family, often making me sound like some sort of heartless evil monster. As a result, I pretty much only liked spending time with my grandparents. I stayed in my room, watched YouTube videos, played video games, and tried to be out of the house as much as possible. However, being grounded all the time stunted my social skills badly. I could never join clubs because we lived 6 miles from school which means I would rely on rides to get to and from meetings and practices. When we moved to a new school district from 7-8th grade, I ate lunch in the bathroom every single day because I couldn’t make any friends. I was constantly stressed and tired from the fighting and I didn’t want to talk about my home life at school. School was always my escape from home and I liked the separation.

My depression and apathy really started kicking in my junior year of high school. Nobody suspected a thing since my academics didn’t take a plunge in the slightest, but I never had to work very hard in school in the first place. I was great at putting on a facade and pretending everything was ok so nobody ever questioned me about it and I guess I kind of liked it that way. It was a super fucked situation that’s hard to explain now, much less 4 years ago. I just wanted to be normal and fit in so badly and I worried that talking about these things would just alienate them from me.

Finally, my graduation date came. I had a 4.3 GPA, Summa Cum Laude, 15 AP credits that earned me a LOT of college credit and solid scholarships from my school choices. On the day of the ceremony I was very sick and said that I didn’t want to go. I actually called my dad to pick me up early and take me home, and he put my mom on the phone so she could yell at me about “how ungrateful I was after everything they did for me in school”. At this point I was fuming, because we already had been fighting for weeks leading up to graduation. I retorted with something along the lines of “if this ceremony is for the people who helped me through school, then you shouldn’t show up” and hung up the phone. 

Ceremony goes by, I walk onstage just feeling underwhelmed and nauseated. I get my degree and leave the auditorium once everyone is dismissed. When I see my parents, my mom is oddly calm but I realize it’s only because my grandma came and wanted to get some pictures. As soon as we’re in the car she starts screaming and crying like usual. 20 minutes of arguing later, she told me I have until the end of the month to pack up my shit and leave. 
At this point in my life, I’m 18 years old, working part-time as a lifeguard making minimum wage. I have no car, less than 1000$ in savings, about to start college and no idea where to sleep. I still figured sleeping on the streets would be better than dealing with my mother’s banshee screaming and unpredictable violence. 

Over the next couple months I started working as a server to make more money, and bounced from couch to couch at friends’ houses. I was too proud to ask to stay for more than a few weeks at a time, until I confided with my childhood friend about my situation. We had grown a little apart, but the love was still there, and without their kindness I probably would have ended my life years ago. They had already long since accepted me as one of their family (I was friends with him before either of his sisters were even born), but staying on their couch for 7 months was probably the closest thing I’ve experienced to having a real and functional family. I took those 7 months to finish my first semester of my computer engineering degree, save up some money and move out to a shitty off-campus apartment. 

The entire first 2 years of college I was either working full-time with a full load of classes or working 2 jobs to save up money for rent and school. I used my restaurant job to feed me regularly by snagging extra food, I stayed up late every night studying, working, and doing homework. My grades were good, and although I was tired and stressed I felt good too. I didn’t make many friends simply because I sprinted from classes to work, and had no free time for clubs. It was probably around this time where I got a lot heavier into drug use. It went from a ~very~ occasional occurrence, to once a week, to multiple times a week and recently almost every day. It started as a way to make my feet hurt less after a 12-hour shift, or a way to loosen up at a social event, but over time it just became habit

It was also during this time that I “reconnected” with my parents. I got into a really bad car accident and totaled my car and I called asking for insurance information. My dad refused and sent my mom to meet me instead. I wasn’t really unhappy to see them... but I wasn’t happy to see them either. At this point I spent an entire year growing on my own and now I’m face to face with my abusers again. What struck me was how weird of an experience it is to face your abusers after their power to abuse is gone... the people I had looked at with nothing but fear and resentment for so long no longer had the ability to make me feel that way. We had a significant history together which would repeat no more. Thus, I was intensely apathetic about them, while my mom at least pretended to feel bad for what she did. I held ALL the power now, and I wasn’t sure how to use it. They knew i would be fine never hearing from them again, so the onus was on them to repair the damage they caused.
Needless to say they did an extremely poor job at it. But, being a 19-year old who spent the better part of 5 years actively despising these people, I guess I just ran out of anger.  I’m never going to forget the abuse and getting kicked out, nor will I forgive it, but rather I just “got over” it. It’s something that happened and can’t change. Since it wasn’t going to happen anymore, that was the attitude I adopted.

The hard times are gone now, and have been for a while now. I saved enough money to only have to work 1 job OR go to classes, not both. I have savings, I made a very good group of friends and it seems like things should be turning up.

But I feel so empty inside. I should be happy that my life will probably never be that hard again. I’m more than halfway through college and my academic freedom is within reach... and the thought is terrifying. I don’t care about anything anymore, barely even myself. I still don’t know how to talk about my problems because I’m convinced it sounds like whining and nobody cares (which I know is bullshit, but it’s a weirdly strong kind of social anxiety). I try going to talk therapy but It seems pointless. I’ve never been one to seek approval from others and talking about my problems and thoughts makes me uncomfortable. I don’t have any passion left for what I’m studying because I hated all the internships I had, and at this point I’m convinced I can’t work a desk job for a career. I’m thoroughly convinced I’m a failure and I can’t derail the train of apathetic and depressive thoughts; rather, that very train is derailing ME.

I’ve spent so long being alone and trying to find some sort of happiness that it sometimes feels like I’ll never really be able to trust and care about someone. There’s nobody in my life who can relate to what I’ve been through, and I’m losing all motivation to try to find them. Even while I was staying on my friends couch, I felt lonely, albeit less so than when I actually was alone. Sitting down with their family for dinner a few nights a week just wasn’t enough to overcome years and years of isolation.

I think this post was half-rant and half cry for help. It was a little cathartic to write, but overall I’m just scared and confused and tired.

TL:DR: I was kicked out of my house after graduation after years of abuse and fighting with my parents. After living on my own for 3 years and “making up” with them, I feel less motivated and more lonely than ever",noobisle1,2019-04-11 19:02:25,1,2253,51.52,17.33,95.94,9.43,20.3,15.18,93.56,56.15,16.87,12.38,10.43,0.4,0.09,0.49,0.98,4.48,4.97,15.67,7.68,6.44,7.41,2.66,17.04,5.37,2.97,1.02,1.95,3.24,6.66,2.66,3.99,0.53,1.6,0.8,7.55,1.24,0.62,0.75,0.49,13.72,2.04,2.09,1.29,3.28,1.91,3.99,2.04,0.49,0.67,0.75,2.31,0.71,0.89,0.18,0.44,8.03,2.4,2.04,2.17,1.42,0.67,7.37,7.63,0.53,16.78,2.22,6.88,7.63,3.64,0.84,1.15,0.98,0,0,0.62,0.36,0.04,0.09,0.13,0,13.76,5.19,3.73,0.18,0.04,0.04,0,0.36,0.71,2.57,0.71,0.22

bc8cxa,1 does this count and 2 if it does I probs diserve it,"So I'm between the ages of 11 and 18 and I recently met thing nice guy. At least, thats what I thought. I met him the same day as one of my other best friend, so we hang out together often.


Everything was all good until around june last year. All ove the sudden, he would blame me for mistakes he made, always critizise me even if I made the right desicion, and overall made me feel terrible. It was just that and I though ""maybe hes just going thru a tought time like me"" and I thought nothing else. But then he found out my depression and anxiety and even though I was formally diagnosed, he said ""stop faking"" and ""you just want attention"" this went along with the above


Then came January. I had gotten sexually harrassed and was even more anxious than usual. He used this to try and destroy my trust with others. He started to change; comforting me, being nice, acting smart, then talking shit about others. ""Best friend"" from earlier had become ""bully to avoid"" he kept me from other kids, and started te slowly isolate me. Soon came March. Last month, not only would he blame me for his mistakes, make me feel terrible about myself, ect, but he would continue to isolate me. I was seeing him *every* *single day* with no relent from him. An now, here we are. 


At this point, he has so much of my trust, but hes keeping me trapped. For the record, I dont cry much, but he can make me cry daily if he wanted. 


I cant get away no matter how hard I try because he has all my social media except this one. What do I need to do? Is this even abuse? I know its repetitive but I dont know what else to say.

I go on to poke the chicken from the plastic wrap. My mom tells me to stop saying some bad words in Spanish while telling me so, something along the line of “pinche niño”. My 13yr old self told her exactly “well, u dont have to say it like that” worst mistake of my 13 yrs of living. She told me to come here in which i did and she slapped me with all of her force, it was so fast and so sudden. She started yelling at me saying bad words in spanish. My dad was laughing, and she kept slapping as hard as she could making  my head turn almost a whole 90 degrees every time. One part of my face was purple afterwards. I already was crying by the first hit. I was so confused and didnt know what to do. She didnt stop slapping me  i was 5’7 at the time and she was too i wanted to get away but when i tried she grabbed me by my hands(still have the scars) and she dug her fingernails into the top of my left hand i started to bleed and i tried to run off again to run away into the streets but she grabbed my arm and scratched them. The scars are gone but there were 2 cuts on each arms. Maybe if i shaved my arms ud see them. There were so many threats being made to me if i said anything. It was friday and they took my phone away and didn’t let me out the whole weekend. When i went to school i told the only friend i could trust about it but i was too scared to tell one of my teachers.

bcbu97,"Months after a relationship with a gaslighting, narcissistic liar, I still have panic attacks when I think of him.","I apologize in advance for how long this is probably gonna be, but I just need to get it out.


So, just over a year ago, I got together with some awesome folks and formed a little team that makes interactive online stories (ARGs, if you know what those are). We ran a few projects together and were having a great time with it, so I decided to get everyone together to realize a project I had been planning for like 5 years. While we were posting teasers around in various communities that we knew were interested in that kind of thing, I met a guy. We'll call him... Stellar.

My good friends, we'll call them A and T, talked to him first, and they thought he seemed really cool. He was really interested in what we were doing, and said he had web design experience and would really love to help us out, for free even.

We all got to talking, and it came out that the reason he was so eager to lend us his skills was because he was going through cancer treatment and people had been really good to him and he wanted to pay that kindness forward to others. Now, me and T have both lost family to cancer so we were immediately super sympathetic to Stellar. He seemed like a genuinely nice dude, we had lots of interests in common, and he was an *astoundingly* good musician, which is something me and T both really admire.

So our friend groups start talking and we're all getting on really well, and everything is great. Then me and my team finally get our big project ready to launch. We had a trailer and tons of puzzles and websites and images, and I had spent weeks stressing over getting everything perfect for the launch. Everyone involved with it, loved it. Stellar especially.

He knew that most of the design and content was stuff I had planned, and he wouldn't stop singing my praises. I was ""a genius"" and ""a true artist"" and he was ""our biggest fan"". And for a while, he really was. No one was as active and involved as him. He was always in my DMs gushing about how much he loved it and theorizing. He made fanart and everything.

After a few days of this, we started having deeper conversations about art and life and dreams and goals, and I thought he was just the coolest cat on two legs. It seemed great. He said he loved my mind, and that I had a beautiful soul, and, y'know, just really laid it on thick. I was pretty thoroughly wooed.

But... There were a lot of red flags early on that I ignored because he just seemed so nice and smart and cool. See, I'm like 98% asexual, and he was very much... Not. And I'm kind of used to almost everyone else in the world being much more sexual than me so I didn't really think much of the multiple unwanted dick pics I got very early on in our relationship. He was always trying to get me to cyber with him, and I just really wasn't into it. I went along with it a couple times because I wanted to make him happy, but it mostly just made me real uncomfortable.

Then there was the constant emotional labor. He almost never *didn't* have some kind of emergency going on. He was incredibly paranoid about this ""dark stalker"" he had that was trying to ""ruin his life"", and he had all of us convinced this was true, but after everything I went through with this dude I honestly have a hard time believing a word he ever said to me.

But on top of deleting his entire online community on multiple occasions to throw off his ""stalker"" and then having a meltdown about having destroyed everything he'd worked to build, he was also going through chemo, which had him sick to the point of not being able to eat and occasionally passing out on the floor. I would beg this man to eat crackers so he wouldn't starve. Beg him to go to bed before he passed out on his desk again. I was literally worried sick about him. I was afraid to be offline in case he needed me.

Meanwhile, I was under a lot of stress trying to keep my game running when several of my teammates flaked on me and I was suddenly doing like 5 people's worth of work. And while I was already barely holding my shit together, Stellar started to get a little overly-attached to the game.

If things started to go in a direction that didn't match *his* vision, he would threaten to quit playing. And since his infatuation with my creation was the basis of our relationship, it felt more like he was threatening to leave *me*. So more often than not, I caved and changed things to make him happy. Then a few days later he'd be mad about something else. He actually accused T and I of conspiring to make him look like a fool because the story we were telling didn't fit every nuance of his theories about it.

He'd yell at me about how things were going in-game, and then gaslight me about it. ""I'm not yelling, we're just having a discussion. Why are you so upset? It's just a game.""

On top of *that*, he haf also developed a crush on one of the other players, and started dating her, too. Which, you know, that's fine. She's really nice. I'm poly, so idfc if my partners date other people. But it got to the point where 99% of my conversations with him were either him gushing about his girlfriend or yelling at me about my game. I even told him on several occasions that sometimes I just wanted to talk to him about music or video games or what was going on in our lives without having to hear about his girlfriend. I just wanted a little bit of time for just him and me. And he kept saying he would make time for us, and he never did.

The bigger red flags came when he told me about trying to doxx his girlfriend to find out more about her. And how he told me to never google him or look him up on facebook. Or how he was open about his relationship with her but not about dating me because he wasn't out as bi. (After a while I did manage to get him to come out as bi and he seemed really happy about it. We also had a lot of discussions about how he thought he was bigender, and for a while he really embraced that and I was very happy for him.)

He also had some real weird obsessions with the show Supernatural, and often pretended to *be* Dean and/or John Winchester.

There's honestly a lot of other stuff that I'm just to tired and stressed to type out now. Just a whole complex web of lies and manipulation that really fucked me over in a myriad of ways for several months. He also moved across the country and mooched off of our mutual friend P for several months and nearly got P evicted and bankrupt. The name he told us doesn't exist, he doesn't carry ID irl and refuses to get a job, he is on ALL the drugs, and we don't even know if we believe he actually had cancer at this point or if he was just on a drug binge or something.

But anyway, the reason I wrote all this out is because I saw a post about John Winchester on my fb feed and had a panic attack because I have one every time something reminds me of him even months after he left me to go drain someone else's love and money.",zikeel,2019-04-12 03:12:38,1,1351,26.29,75.22,26.58,38.97,18.76,14.06,92.97,61.95,20.43,15.17,5.7,2.15,0.22,6.96,0.15,5.26,4.52,14.51,8.59,8.44,9.84,1.55,17.69,5.11,2.37,1.26,0.67,3.18,5.77,3.26,2.52,0.96,1.04,0.15,16.21,0.15,0.89,0.3,6.81,13.92,2,2.29,1.33,3.92,1.92,4.29,2.15,0.81,0.81,0.44,2.15,0.22,0.89,0.44,0.37,10.14,5.33,1.7,1.85,1.78,0.3,8.96,5.55,1.04,13.55,2,6.22,5.33,1.41,1.48,0.15,0.52,0.07,0,0.96,0.22,0.15,0.22,0.07,0.15,14.8,5.7,4.22,0,0,0.07,0,0.15,1.04,2.22,0.3,1.11

bchshe,"I still believe the gaslighting, and I'm struggling with it.","Hey there. I'm writing this because, despite having gotten out of a bad relationship, I still feel a lot of effects from it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I was with a dude for nearly 4 years. He had a sweet and kind side, but also had a lot of mental/personality issues that made our relationship chaotic. (Full disclosure, I've since realized I didn't help the situations by being super codependent at the time.) When his switch would flip, he'd go from kind, sensitive, and happy to vicious, bitter, and cruel. Sometimes it would be as small as me suggesting a different hike to take, or me asking a question in a video game. There was a lot of pain in that relationship, and as I suspected he had borderline, I spent a lot of time on that subreddit trying to figure out how to make things work/not piss him off anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still struggle to wrap my head around *why* he'd be so cruel, but what stuck with me was the gradual assertions over time that I was ""the crazy one."" He convinced me that my severe anxiety was the root of our issues, and not a result of them. And then used that premise to dismiss all of my concerns with ""that's just your anxiety talking, you don't really want XYZ."" By the very end, I *was* very emotional, would break down crying in the first 10 minutes of a fight, and would get berated for being sensitive, crazy, emotional, dramatic. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I left, we tried to stay friends, and when he learned I was dating again, he told me he wouldn't ""stand idly by while you destroy other men."" Suffice to say, that's hurt deeply and fucked with my head a lot in following relationships. The next dude I dated, seemed very sweet and loving for the first few months, but would get very defensive and cruel when I'd bring up issues. (I've asked myself countless times if I was being unreasonable in my concerns, and have asked friends objectively if I was in the wrong.) Telling this second man that his reckless driving and spending was really concerning for me, he got upset and said ""I've talked to my family about you, and they all think you're fucking crazy and I should have left you weeks ago.""

&amp;#x200B;

That line's stuck with me, even after this second relationship ended. I'm now dating a guy, but it's a very superficial, cursory relationship with little emotional depth. I honestly don't know if I'll ever feel safe to really open my heart up and connect with another guy again on a romantic level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I had to text an ex because I'm getting his sister's junk mail at my address, and it's a painful reminder he and I dated. I was upset, but made sure in the texts to be calm and rational. ""Why is she using my address/why is this showing up here? It's tiresome to feel like you still live here. Are you sure all your addresses are updated?"" (exact string of texts I sent). 

&amp;#x200B;

He got super defensive and said he was ""tired of you bashing me for things that aren't my fault, who gives a fuck, it's spam, stop taking your anger out on me."" (again, exact lines from his text.)

&amp;#x200B;

I've shown the conversation to 2 trusted friends and asked them to tell me if I was being the asshole, as I'd rather be objective than shout into an echo chamber. They've both agreed he was super defensive, and that I wasn't bashing him. I'm trying so hard to be rational, objective, and open-minded to the idea I could be wrong in these situations, yet I'm repeatedly called the crazy one. I'm really struggling with this. 

&amp;#x200B;

bcicy8,"i need suggestions, i dont know what to do","i stay on reddit, usually logged off. i only made this account because im not sure who to talk to or what. so i'm fairly young, finishing up highschool. me and my boyfriend have been experimenting sexually. somewhat longer relationship. i trust him with my life, and hes my bestfriend.

hes the nicest boy ive ever met, i know it sounds bad starting it off like that, but i dont think he'd do this intentionally. i just i feel sort of unsure because he couldve just messing around but also does this mean it's going to happen again?

i go over to his place occasionally to watch movies, or mess around when were both in the mood. this time, yesterday, i went over to his house and we had discussed watching some movies and usually we cuddle and sleep together.

i was turned away from him while we were cuddling so it's possible that he just didnt know i was asleep? but also, when i asked he thought i was still awake. this is his first relationship and he explained to me he thought he was pleasing me and that i wanted that.


so what happened that day and what im posting this for, is, i went to his house, watched some movies, i was asleep, and he started like touching me. i woke up immediately and was like ""not now"" and sort of just needed a minute. he apologized, comforted me and said he shouldve known better. he said hed watched videos where the guy would please the girl in her sleep and woke up and was fine with it, horny, etc.

ive been in an abusive relationship before where my ex purposely did those things except knowing i was a sleep. and didnt stop even when i told him to. and my friend says she thinks it was truly an accident and probably him watching too much porn and just to establish a boundary and if he crosses it again then its no longer an accident.

is she right? im so scared because ive been so happy with him, and i dont know if im just settling and further ignoring red flags??
advice please.&lt;3",ladyjade-0220,2019-04-12 13:23:18,5,377,3.18,46.82,60.18,45.25,15.71,14.59,95.49,63.93,25.2,18.3,10.61,0.8,0,6.9,0,6.9,2.65,9.81,11.67,9.02,11.41,2.12,22.55,3.98,2.39,2.65,0.53,1.33,4.51,2.65,1.59,0.53,0.27,0,14.32,0,1.06,1.06,6.9,13.79,3.45,1.59,2.12,4.24,0.8,3.18,3.45,1.86,1.06,0.53,2.39,1.59,0.27,0.8,0,6.9,3.45,0.8,1.59,0.27,1.06,10.61,10.34,0.53,14.32,1.59,6.37,6.63,0.27,1.33,0.53,0.27,0,0,0.53,0,0.27,0,0,0,13.53,5.04,5.04,0,0.27,1.33,0,0,0.53,1.06,0,0.27

bco476,Is this sexual assault?,"I need your guys opinions and then i’m going to delete this because i’m paranoid someone’s going to find it. 

Ok so this happened a couple months ago, i was at a party with my friends and this guy who i was sorta dating (he wanted to date me, i thought i liked him, eventually realized i didn’t, but for the time being i didn’t want a relationship so we decided to become fwb). (during the entire month we didn’t even do more than hold hands thank god and what i’m about to say) we’re both 17. i’m f he’s m. at the party he immediately gets high and downs like 1/4 a bottle of vodka (he says he’s not drunk but me and everybody else agree that he’s wasted). for the whole night that i’m there i probably not even half of a sip of jack daniels and that’s it. we’re about two weeks into our “”relationship”” if you can call it that. 

we’ve talked mainly at school or just texting and have hugged or held hands which i was perfectly fine with. he’s texted me asking me playing games like “these three people in our class” and that was fine whatever i went along. but he’s also texted me asking if i shave “down there” i immediately get uncomfortable but laugh it off over text and change the topic. he doesn’t even apologize. 

anyways back to the party. we all (6 of us including me) go on a walk. he loudly tells me he loves me and that was so fucking embarrassing saying that in front of everyone because what else was i supposed to do? this was only 2 weeks in of course i didn’t love him. so i said it back. this whole time we’re taking a walk he’s leaning on me for support (basically walking behind me with his arms wrapped around me) and he’s talking about how i have size B boobs and a size C and then he grabs my boob. i’m really uncomfortable with that and all my friends kinda look at me weird but i just laugh and continue fucking walking for some reason. eventually he gets off of me or i push him off onto someone else to lean onto or he has to throw up or something i don’t remember. 

anyways the next morning comes everyone’s outside and i kinda want to be alone so i go inside but of fucking course he follows me inside and he wraps his arms around my waist (once i realize how clingy he is i immediately realize how much i don’t like him and want to end it but for some reason i still put up with it for a good 2 more weeks). so i go sit on the bed and he sits next to me. and i stand up. and he lays down. and he says “hey i wanna try something” so he pulls me onto his lap and i immediately say “no i’m uncomfortable” (not only because of sexual reasons i’m kinda self conscious with my weight and don’t like sitting on anyone’s laps) so i push him away but he’s holding onto me so it takes a couple seconds. so he goes into the bathroom and i go back outside. later that day he texts me and tells me he got hard over that. (look i’m mature i get human sexuality but when this guy forced me to sit on him ew) so i was grossed out by that but just sent something like “lmao” probably. 

skip to probably a week later in class he asks if at lunch he can put his hand on my thigh at lunch. (i’ll give him this, he did ask this in class. but keep reading) i say MAYBE. so lunch comes, he tries it, i grab his hand and tell him to stop. (i immediately realize i don’t like it. we’re in front of the whole school, the teachers, and our friends). he does it again. i tell him to stop. he does it again. hes not just touching my knee he’s going for very upper inner thigh here like centimeters away from the danger zone (i can’t even remember if he did touch there, it’s very possible he did, this was october i think) he stops though. but the next day he does it again. and the next day. and the next day. and the next day. all up until i ghost on him and he sends me a text saying “do you not wanna do this anymore” and i text him back like “blah blah i’m sorry i like how it used to be blah blah”

the worst part now is like he’s dating one of my best friends. i don’t even care that she’s dating someone i was “with” its just the fact that it’s him. i don’t want this to happen to her. and i know she has a problem with rushing into things. my worst fear is that he does the same thing to her and hurts or that they get super serious and i’ll have to live with this secret forever of what he did to me

so i ask you guys. do you think this is sexual assault? please help",delpoly,2019-04-13 00:25:44,4,891,10.52,54.04,67.91,37.69,18.18,10.55,95.85,63.75,26.82,19.42,10.21,1.35,0.56,7.18,0.11,7.41,3.59,12.68,8.98,7.52,9.43,2.02,20.09,3.37,1.68,1.23,1.23,1.8,5.39,3.03,2.36,0.67,0.56,0.34,16.27,0,1.12,0.45,7.18,11.9,2.02,1.46,1.46,3.48,1.12,4.26,2.69,0.22,1.23,1.23,3.37,1.35,0.11,1.12,0.67,7.86,3.7,0.56,2.02,1.23,0.79,4.15,13.69,1.23,15.94,2.92,6.85,6.62,0.9,0.9,0.22,0,0.11,0.11,2.58,0.67,0.79,0.22,0,0.67,16.95,5.05,1.23,0,0,0.34,0,0,2.24,5.5,2.47,0.11
bcqpr5,What do you think about this situation?,"Me (20,f) as a child was forced by my elder cousin into kisses and inappropriate contact. He is 6 years older than me and even though I can't exactly recall at which age I got this happening (I think I was between 5-7) he was a kid as well, I mean.. he couldn't be older than 12.

Can this be seen as abuse?

Also, it's generally said that people suffering from this kind of abuse or inappropriate bodily contact as kids then repress it as adult but what I find weird is that I've never blocked this and I was always aware growing up of this memory, also I never remind it as something ""traumatic"". I remember I was ashamed and that I didn't like it but also, it never fazed me that much growing up, not now

Can childhood abuse leave you unaffected? Or maybe it does affects me now in more subconscious ways?

bcs6nq,Abusive mother.,"I'm trying to make this text as much understandable as I can..here we go.

My mother is a very annoying and abusive person if she is even a little bit nervous and unfortunately she is nervous very often.

For example, in this morning she was very angry because the kitchen was a bit dirty and she told me to do my chores why was sleeping and I couldn't hear her and I felt a bit sick tho. 

I woke up while she was furiously yelling at me and I explained my situation, despite the fact she started to disrespect me; she told I never do nothing, I'm a failure, I'm a fat cow, I'm so lazy and I am unable to even do anything. And she clearly said she is considering to kick me out of home or ask money from me, I don't know if this was legit but it is still offensive because I do the chores every day after school.

After this situation, like a hour later, I went out, my mom texted me and I started to express my feelings and describe this situation.
This converstation became pointless very quickly because for example when I asked why did she call me a cow then she asked why am I lying and she never said that.
I feel hopeless because this not a first time when she says anything and when I ask about it then she becomes denial and asks why I am lying.

This whole thing about my mom makes me sick and I don't know what to do. I have an eating disorder because of my mom. She has been telling me I'm fat since I was 12 and in fact I have never been like...overweighted. And she is very unsupportive. When I told her about my plan to buy a electric guitar then she called me talentless and such. She has told me that she could have done an abourtion and she told once that this is my fault that I don't have a real father living with me

The difficult thing is that she is not always like this and sometimes she is a very nice person and she has a good sense of humor, but when she flips over like I said it is hard to recover and forget this abusive behaviour. Her words hurts me a lot.",trapmrn,2019-04-13 09:20:37,0,401,4.56,43.06,39.8,1,25.06,13.72,95.51,66.58,25.44,19.45,12.47,0.25,0,6.73,0,5.99,4.99,8.98,12.22,7.48,10.97,2.49,22.19,4.99,2.24,2.49,0.75,1.75,6.73,1.25,5.49,0.5,2.49,0.75,14.96,1.5,0,7.98,0.25,11.97,2.74,2.99,1,2.24,2.24,2,2.99,0,1.5,1.25,2.24,0.75,1.25,0,1.25,3.99,0.75,1.75,1,0.25,0.75,7.23,12.47,1,9.98,1,2,7.23,1,0.5,1,0.5,0,0,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,0,10.22,5.24,2.49,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,2.24,0,0
bcsz0n,How do I help my wife?,"I’m sorry in advanced for the lengthy post, but it’s a complicated situation, and I have nowhere else to turn to for advice. I have to help her.

My wife has a history of abusive relationships before we got together. The first one was physically abusive when she was a teenager. It only ended because my father in law saw the bruises and got a restraining order against her boyfriend. The next was her ex husband. She says he was very kind in the beginning. She knew that other girls had called the police to intervene so they could get out of relationships with him in the past. She always thought they were just being dramatic and there was no way he was mean. She got pregnant 3 months into their relationship, and things started to change. He started getting a temper, and getting ill easily. After her daughter was born, it got worse. He would constantly find things to yell at her about, and would cuss at her, and belittle her, then convince her it was her fault, and make her apologize. It kept getting worse and worse until it got to the point where after working a night shift he would refuse to let her sleep during the day, and force her to stay awake to cook and clean for him. He would always accuse her of cheating on him, and threaten to leave her unless she would perform weird sex acts to “get him to stay.” When I met her she was working at the hospital as a nurse aid, and I’m an EMT. The first time I saw her, I thought she was the prettiest woman I had ever seen. She was wearing a wedding ring though, so I never so much as complimented her. She had some great friends at the hospital, and she finally opened up to a few of them about her marriage. They convinced her that she needed to leave him, and after months of them building her up, that’s exactly what she did. I came in the hospital one day, and noticed she wasn’t wearing her ring, but didn’t think much about it because diamond rings cut through latex gloves, so a lot of people don’t wear them in the ER. For a couple of months I noticed she never wore her ring anymore, and one day I overheard her talking to her coworker about living with her grandparents, and asking about different divorce lawyers and how much they would cost. I walked my chubby tail right over to her when she was by herself, and told her that I “called dibs on the first date” when she felt like she was ready to start seeing someone. She laughed and playfully hit me in the arm, and told me I was crazy. I brushed it off that she wasn’t interested, until about a month later she messaged me on Facebook and started up a conversation. I got her number, and eventually asked her on a date. She told me she was living at her grandparent’s house, and was saving up money for a lawyer. She said it had actually been pretty easy since she left. He was mad at first, and tried to make her jealous by bragging about the other women he was talking to, but it didn’t bother her because she was so done with him. Then one day she pulled up at the station, and I went outside to talk to her. We talked at her car for a while, and when she went to leave, she leaned out the car window to kiss me. Well, while our lips are locked up, guess who drove by and happened to see. It was him. I heard his brakes lock up, and as soon as she saw that ugly ass truck, she immediately started crying and having a panic attack. He pulled into the station on 2 wheels, and jumped out of his truck. It weirded me out that he completely ignored me, and started screaming and cussing at her while leaning around me to see her. I’ve never heard anyone be talked to like that. He called her a worthless whore, a dirty slut, and so many other names I can’t even type out. I got pretty mad, and got in his face. I’m not one to start fights, but I’m about 5 inches taller, and about a hundred pounds heavier, and I was pretty confident I could whoop his ass. He finally engaged me, but would step back every time I stepped closer. He threatened to murder me, and a bunch of other stuff. We argued until my shift captain came out and threatened to call the cops. Then the verbal abuse started again. He would call her dozens of times a day. He’d beg for her to come back one time, then cuss her out the next. At first she was confident, and would give it right back to him. Then she started getting worn down, and I saw her resolve fade. I started wondering if she was believing the things he called her. After being together for several months, her mental health got pretty bad. She was always one edge, she would have panic attacks daily. She started being distant with me, and started spending less time with me. It occurred to me that we had been together for almost a year, she had been separated from him for 18 months, and she still hadn’t filed for divorce. I started seeing a pattern. One day I confronted her about it, and she broke down, and told me everything. She had been sleeping with him. When I asked her why all she would say is that she’s a whore, and she doesn’t deserve me. I did something I’d never done before and asked her if I could go through her phone. I read their texts. I almost puked when I saw what she was going through. It was full of blackmail, and insults, and threats. “If you don’t leave him, I’ll shoot him in the head.” “Come over here and suck my dick, or I’ll send him A video of us fucking. He’ll never believe it was from before you got with him.” That’s when I did the dumbest thing I’ve ever done. I lost my temper, and I slammed her phone into the ground and shattered it. I got in my car and went to find him. I was going to kill him. He wasn’t home, he wasn’t at work, I couldn’t find him anywhere. I calmed down, and went back home. She was still there. I told her I loved her but I couldn’t stay unless she divorced him, and got out of his control. She did, and things seemed better for a long time. It got rough again when we got married, then calmed down. He got pissed off again when we had our son, but he stopped after a while. We’ve been married for almost 3 years now, and the past year and a half has been hell. She started having break downs more often, and I could tell something was wrong. I confronted her, and she admitted he had been trying to get her in bed again. She showed me her texts, and she had been telling him no. I convinced her to go see a counselor. We picked the worst one I could imagine. She told my wife that it was still going on because was too scared to do anything, and told her to stop having a pity party. Then asked her what she did to provoke him to abuse her. The woman actually got fired about 2 weeks later because of multiple patients complaining that she blamed them for their abuse. It ruined my wife’s trust in counselors. Fast forward to now. She’s depressed, and has anxiety. She tells me everything. It’s about once a week that he blows up on her. He’s controlling. She lies to him about me not being around because he gets so mad if I am. He uses my step baby as an excuse to control her. He accuses her of being a horrible mother if she ignores him. She won’t let me help. I’ve offered to beat his ass, call the police, kill him, do whatever to make it stop. She says it’ll just get worse if I intervene. She threatens to leave if I try to go behind her and confront him. She starts having an anxiety attack if I mad about the things she tells me that he says. I don’t know what to do anymore. How do I help her? How do I convince her that we need to get help? She’s convinced that if she records his phone calls, he’ll know what she’s doing. He tells he’s friends with all the cops around, so if she calls them, they’ll take his side and arrest her lying. I feel like my hands are tied. I’m torn between protecting my wife and son, and going to jail, losing my marriage, and ruining my relationship with my step baby. It really hit home today when she called me during a melt down. She had taken little bit to him and he started screaming at her for being 5 minutes late. She said he got so close that he was spitting on her face. He held her car door open and wouldn’t let her leave. She told me she wanted him to hit her so that she would have proof and could finally end all of this. My wife wanted a man to hit her to stop the abuse. That really hurt to think about. I know all of this makes me sound like the biggest pussy you’ve ever heard of, and you’d be right. I have no idea how I let another man abuse my wife. You can say whatever you want about me, I don’t care. Just someone please tell me how to help my wife.",UglyButFunctional,2019-04-13 10:34:43,5,1680,16.93,88.41,8.59,1.14,14.36,12.26,95.89,62.26,25.83,21.25,6.79,0.71,0.36,12.62,0.77,4.58,4.4,12.68,9.4,5.83,8.69,1.67,21.43,3.27,1.96,1.61,1.49,1.19,6.49,1.61,4.88,0.65,2.56,0.65,22.62,1.61,0.3,9.46,4.64,10,1.79,1.55,2.14,1.96,1.43,2.5,2.62,0.77,1.37,0.42,2.2,1.13,0.65,0.48,0.06,9.35,2.98,1.19,3.1,2.02,1.19,10.06,7.26,1.19,16.49,2.56,6.01,8.33,0.83,0.36,0.42,0.24,0.06,0.18,0.95,0.77,0,0,0.12,0,15.42,6.79,5.12,0,0,0.18,0,0,0.48,2.86,0,0
bcv3mw,should the abuse victim stay quiet in order to protect their abuser they actually love and are close to? this is the first time i am typing this out.,"after years and years of making myself feel guilty, last year i realized i was sexually abused by my older brother. (4 years difference) 
i have always been close to him and i love him. he is no doubt one of my best friends but i cannot forget about the events that have happened while we were growing up. 

(although as a coping method i did try to forget as much as possible, pretending it never happened, that it is just my imagination, sometimes i still wonder if it actually happened or not but i am pretty certain these memories cannot possibly be fabricated.) 

i was coerced to perform oral sex on my older brother when i was around 8 years old. (so he was 12) i don’t know for how long we did it, but one day it just stopped. at the time i didn’t completely understand what was going on and thought this was just something we did because we loved each other as siblings, so i went along with it. i kind of forgot how but i’m assuming after a period of time we just kind of stopped and never talked about it again. 

after these events i kind of hated my brother and at times really did not want to cooperate with him. for years i also hated myself because i couldn’t believe i actually did that and felt disgusted with myself. i thought it was all my fault because i actually willfully did it at the time, not understanding what was wrong. obviously now i understand that i was literally a child and didn’t know better. 

over the course of time i have learned to forgive my brother because i know even though we have never talked about it, i know that he deeply regrets it too. in the end, he is still a great guy who always gives me advice and cares for me.

i have kept this a secret for more than 12 years now. nobody knows except for me and my brother. at times i do want people to know what had happened to me but at the same time i don’t want people to despise my brother for what he did. nor do i want people to think i was a disgusting child. 

my brother witnessed my father assaulting (domestic abuse) my mother and i think that is what partly resulted in my abuse. so i  find it hard to a 100% only put the blame on my brother.  

would it be a good idea to tell this to my best friend(s)? i don’t know why i actually want people to know. how is their knowledge of me being abused going to benefit me? im not sure. at times i just feel suffocated i guess. the fact that i would have to keep this a secret for the rest of my life really messes with my head sometimes. it makes me feel like i’m a lunatic that had made up these memories in her own mind and that it never actually happened. 

im actually a virgin and never had a bf/gf before. people think i haven’t done anything yet and am a prude but in reality i have probably sucked a dick before any of my friends have. and it was my brothers. yikes. if only people knew lol. 

well now i finally typed it out, so now whole reddit knows. what would you do in my situation?",awakenthetruth,2019-04-13 13:50:40,4,605,12.79,13.4,98.55,16.34,16.81,13.88,95.87,62.98,23.14,15.54,12.4,0.99,0.17,1.49,0.5,7.6,4.13,12.07,10.74,8.26,7.44,3.47,21.32,4.13,3.14,1.98,1.32,1.16,5.95,2.64,3.31,0.33,1.98,0.17,9.59,1.98,0.99,0.5,3.31,20.33,6.12,1.98,2.15,3.47,2.15,5.62,0.99,0,0.17,0.83,1.65,0.33,0.17,0.83,0,7.77,4.13,0.83,1.65,0.99,0.99,7.77,11.9,0.33,13.72,0.99,4.3,8.43,0.83,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,1.16,0.33,0.66,0,0.17,0,11.07,5.29,1.65,0,0,0.66,0,0,0,1.49,1.65,0.33
bcwl9u,16M living in an abusive household,"First and foremost, my account is an alt since some members of my family know of my other account and are active on reddit so I want to avoid getting found out as much as possible.

I live with 2 abusive parents that hit me, insult me, have done just about everything short of sexual abuse and lethal or long-lasting injuries that are clearly result of abuse. My dad is the one doing most of the hitting but my mom has thrown hard edged objects at me and has told me to go kill myself and that I wasn't her child. I don't want to go in detail since I know no one likes of text but I feel as though hitting me til I bleed and tieing me to a full speed treadmill when I was 10 isn't very light when it comes to physical abuse. I've only refrained from calling the cops because my brother and sister are getting their uni paid by my parents. They faked it til they made is the best way to describe them. However, I don't have many options since my dad is forcing me to go on a trip and I don't want to go since I know something is bound to happen. I don't have a job but I'm really trying to get one but all the messages left on my home phone are deleted by my dad and I don't get service where I live on my phone. I have friends that could help me but I need a job and I've got no way to get it so I need advice. I know this is hard to ask but I'd like to avoid the police for my siblings, even if they don't help me.

Thank you so very much and I'm really sorry about the wall of text.",LimpingPole,2019-04-13 16:18:44,2,316,23.61,11.47,92,5.51,26.33,11.08,94.62,59.18,19.94,16.46,14.24,0,0.32,0.32,1.58,3.48,4.11,14.24,10.44,5.7,10.13,3.16,22.47,3.8,1.9,0.95,1.9,1.9,4.43,1.27,3.16,0.63,2.22,0.32,9.81,3.16,0.32,0.95,1.27,13.61,1.9,2.22,2.22,2.53,0.95,4.75,2.22,0.32,0.63,0.95,2.22,0.63,1.9,0.32,0,8.23,3.48,0.95,1.9,2.22,0.95,3.48,16.46,0,11.08,2.22,5.38,3.48,1.27,0.63,0.95,0.95,0,0.63,0.32,0,0.32,0,0,0,9.49,3.48,1.58,0,0,0,0,0.32,0,4.11,0,0
bcy5d8,"TW SA/DV PTSD reaction to intimate moment with spouse, he’s mad at me but knows my past","TW: SA 
Ok mobile formatting etc, I’m having such bad anxiety right now. So I was sitting on the floor next to my SO and he starts crawling on top of me. 
I immediately start saying no over and over again and start pushing him back. (It wasn’t hard or aggressive, more like one hand to help him sit back up, but definitely to crest distance) Neither of us are hurt or anything
This all feels like slow motion. 
So he straightens up and yells you could just say no once! You didn’t have to push me. 

He knows where my trauma comes from. We’ve talked about it, ALOT. In fights sometimes he brings it up, like how I’ll have to live w my family who sexually and emotionally abused me if he leaves me and kicks me out. I’ll be “passed” around again. 

So I’m kind of upset now, that he can’t even correlate the two things in this situation. Like being held down, climbed on top of where I can’t escape is triggering. 
I’ve said “no” once and it didn’t stop him
Even when I kept saying it, when I had to plead, begging for him to stop until I just wasn’t there more anymore. Truthfully I haven’t found myself since. 

But yeah I apologized for my reaction
He accepted

I want to tell him why that triggered me, but no matter what I say he doesn’t care or will use it against me.
So, I’m writing to you guys. I guess I want to know if he’s that oblivious? That manipulative?

bczbk6,is this an abusive family?,"i’m going to try my best to make this post neat and legible so sorry in advance.

i’ll start with my mom. 80% of the time she is yelling at me and making me feel like absolute shit. but then right after, she is so nice! i love her, but i also know how much she hurts me. she forced herself into me to look at my arms (i am a self harmer, i’m sorry) and now she makes fun of me for it and makes jokes about it when she’s mad. i also feel as if i have no boundaries with her, like she wants to see everything on my phone, she actively invaded my room and looks through everything.

next, my dad! he was diagnosed with depression and he has a very bad anger problem. i’m 13, and when i think back to my “childhood” (7-11) all i can remember in general is endless nights hiding in my bed while i can hear him throwing stuff and yelling. he also fights with my mom a lot, so that’s a lot of my memories. he also likes to practice karate on me, and has no physical boundaries if you know what i mean, he’s very “touchy touchy”. he throws and punches things, i have a couple holes in MY walls from him. just a couple hours ago he threw a chair at me and luckily it got blocked by the vacuuming cleaner.  

lastly, my house. i just honestly don’t feel safe here at all, not to mention it is very gross and disgusting. our shower is filled with black mold and so is our sink. our floor is littered with trash as my mom will eat then throw her wrappers on the floor. i always keep my room clean.

oh, sometimes they also refuse to feed me, but that’s ok because the only drinks we have is soda (NO water) and a lot of freezer and junk food.

i hope you read this post, and can you please tell me if this is actually abuse? i love them sometimes, but they are so mean and HORRIBLE for my mental health + self esteem",Ella3222,2019-04-13 21:42:57,7,369,12.4,47.83,56.3,17.85,16.04,11.11,94.58,59.62,23.85,19.78,11.38,1.08,0.81,5.69,0.81,4.07,3.52,11.11,8.4,6.5,11.65,1.36,16.8,5.69,1.9,1.08,1.08,2.17,8.67,4.07,4.61,0.27,2.17,1.08,13.01,1.36,0,4.07,2.71,11.65,2.98,1.9,1.63,2.98,1.63,2.44,4.07,1.08,1.08,1.9,3.52,0.54,0.81,0,1.63,4.88,1.9,1.08,0.81,0.81,1.08,1.63,14.91,1.9,12.47,1.36,5.69,5.15,0.54,1.08,1.9,0,0,0,0.81,0.27,0,0.27,0.27,0,16.53,4.88,4.61,0,0,0.54,0.54,0.27,1.08,2.44,1.63,0.54
bd05m6,(M)y wonderful gf is going through a rough time,"I’ve never been to this sub before, but I need some input and advice.

My wonderful girlfriend is currently in a really shitty, borderline abusive living situation (with family), with no way to seek therapy or outside help. She has a lot of trauma in her past, and she’s never been allowed to acknowledge any of it or work through it. In her own words, I’m one of the first people in her life who’s taken her seriously and wanted to love her and listen to her and help her towards healing. I have my own trauma and history, so I can understand where she’s coming from, and I want to support her to the best of my ability.

That being said, she really dumps a lot of difficult, traumatic stuff on me. This happens a lot, and very suddenly, often when we’re on dates or chatting on the phone and having a good time, and it goes downhill pretty fast. It’s way too much information for me to process most of the time, and difficult for me to carry when I’m also dealing with my own precarious living situation and shit in my life. Not to mention, it kind of kills the romance or fun vibe of what we were doing, and ends up being a therapy session as I desperately try to do anything as she spirals down into herself. She’s an amazing person, but there are an increasing number of times where I’m doing the heavy lifting and emotional care in the relationship, so to speak, and the balance gets way way WAY out of whack. 

I’ve been there. I know how that feels. I’ve been that person. But it’s too much for me. I can’t handle it.

My questions are: is this selfish? Am I a hypocrite? I want to support her and I DO NOT want to leave her in the slightest, but I don’t know if I can face another date like that. It’s gotten to the point where I dread and start panicking when she wants to call me, and that’s not a healthy response to have. What do I do, and how do I support her while staying healthy myself?",throwaway4insure,2019-04-13 23:45:10,11,377,27.84,34.52,61.88,25.77,17.95,15.65,93.9,62.6,20.16,14.32,8.75,0.53,0,5.04,0,5.84,5.57,14.59,10.61,6.1,10.34,2.12,19.1,4.24,1.59,2.92,0.53,2.39,8.49,4.24,4.24,0.8,1.06,0,10.88,0.27,0.8,5.31,0,12.2,1.86,1.06,1.86,4.77,0.53,3.98,1.86,0,1.06,0.8,2.92,0.8,1.86,0,0,6.9,2.92,1.33,1.59,1.33,0.8,2.65,15.12,0.8,15.12,2.39,7.43,5.84,0.53,0.8,0.27,0,0,0.27,0.8,0.53,0.27,0,0,0,16.71,4.51,5.57,0.27,0,0.8,0,0,0,4.51,1.06,0
bd2he2,I´m Stuck.,"\*warning: triggering, talk of self harm, sexual, physical and psychological abuse\*   
Hello.. I’m new to reddit and a bit hesitant posting this as it is very private, having said that, I’m desperate to figure out what to do from this point forward.. this could be a long one so I’m sorry in advance..   
Growing up my mum made all the decisions around the house, she decided what I would wear, she bleached my hair so I’d be “blonde”, she put me on diets, she took me to a modelling agency, to modelling shows, photoshoots and did all my homework for me because she knew how to do it “better”. Those were her projects so it didn’t seem as bad, but little by little things went out of control.   
My parents had money when I was very young, we would go on expensive vacations, have over the top christmas mornings, my brother and I went to an overpriced private school, my dad remodelled her childhood home so it would be bigger and better.. the whole thing. However, by the time I was eight my dad had lost his job and the money went quickly, we moved to her childhood home and started going to a public school, the vacations stopped, they sold her minivan and, well, it affected her because she never had money before my dad and the only reason she married him was so she would never be in that situation again (as she said gracefully multiple times).   
If she strived for perfection before now she felt like she had something to prove so she would get upset even if we got a 90% on a test. She never hit my brother but If she was styling my hair and I moved she would hit me with the wooden brush in the head. She would chase me around the house and when I felt she could grab me I would grab my knees and cover my stomach while she kicked me and screamed at me. She told me I was a slut, a whore, stupid a moron.. the worst things, and when she decided she wasn’t upset anymore she’d say I love you and move on. I was nine years old and I wanted to die. I started cutting, I don’t know why, I had never seen that before.. but I liked it and it made me feel better. In the middle of tests when I would get frustrated I would ask to go to the bathroom and I would sit on the back of the toilet and hit my head until it bled. I found a way to  distance myself from my friends and everyone in general. I would only talk with my close friends or at home and most of what I said was made up, I realised that by making my mum laugh and saying what she wanted to hear nothing bad would happen so I lied every single day to everyone who would listen so they could tell my mum how smart, happy and friendly I was. I still do that to this day.  
My dad never knew this was happening, in front of him my mom would give us time outs and talk to us about the things that we weren’t meant to do (by the way, we weren’t misbehaved children, we never fought, got good grades and honestly we were walking on eggshells our whole lives so I don’t know what she got mad about most times).  
I remember vividly her telling me she was going to kill herself so I could ask for whatever I wanted for christmas since they wouldn’t have someone to charge for it.  
One time I got an 80% in history and she stopped speaking to me for a month and a half. She would always bring up our financial situation so my dad would feel guilty and give her everything she wanted. My dad was forty-five at that time and no one would hire him and by the time I was ten we couldn’t afford food, so my Nan (my dad’s mum) paid for everything, food, clothes, gas, etc.   
Part of my mums family is a bunch of scary people and she convinced us that they were trying to kill us so we wouldn’t try to go out to the store a block away when she wasn’t home. Whenever I wanted to go to a friends house she’d get upset saying we didn’t had gas money which my dad felt embarrassed about so I stopped asking him at all, going to the cinema was out of the question and we became isolated apart from the few occasions I would convince them to let me go after school and then they just had to pick me up. She successfully convinced me that I was less-than for not having any money.   
By that time my mum started going to the casino every week, which turned into every other day, which became every day from the moment she woke up to the moment she went to sleep.. there were times where I wouldn’t see her at all for weeks. She told us it was her attempt at getting money but I think it was her way of getting out of the situation (a family friend went with her and gave her money to play and she’d get mad at my dad if she wasn’t there to make sure she didn’t spend it all in one sitting so my dad would go and sit beside her for hours while my brother and I were home alone).  
When I was twelve I started talking through msn with this boy that used to go to my primary school and was two years older than me (let’s call him Carlos). One day I got a message from an unknown address saying that he was Carlos and that his e-mail got hacked by very “rude” people and to block and delete him so they couldn’t contact me, so I did. We talked for roughly a month and the messages we exchanged were quite flirty, I told him I had never kissed anyone before and I would like to because some of my friends already had.   
Anyways, I overheard my parents talking about my older brother going to a friends house that Friday and them dropping me off at my grandmas so I wouldn’t be alone but then decided against it and so I would have the house to myself for around 6 hours. I was thrilled and devised a plan for Carlos to go to my house and play ssb melee. Now, obviously, I wanted to have my first kiss that day as I had a crush on him and thought it was the coolest story for a first kiss.   
Friday came, I was dropped off at home after school and I took out all the games my brother and I owned so he would be impressed, took off my school vest and shoes so I wouldn’t look lame, and waited for a little bit, then, the bell rang, the intercom turned on and.. nothing? I saw the wall of the entrance on the screen, pressed the button and said his name, he responded “yes, hi -my name-” I ran downstairs and opened the garage door as I didn’t had keys. When I peeped my head out it wasn’t only that he was clearly not Carlos, he wasn’t fourteen, this person must have been at least twenty, but he still looked familiar so I got confused, he stood confident, asked me if he could come in and I still don’t understand why but I said yes. Walking inside he told me that he was Carlos’ brother and that he couldn’t make it so he came instead, my blood went cold at that moment as I knew that Carlos didn’t had any siblings.  
I felt lightheaded and not sure of what to do, we were already inside and even if I tried to get out through the back door I wouldn’t be able to make it outside. I knew I shouldn’t go upstairs so I turned right to the living room and the next thing I remember was him pushing me against the couch and raping me.   
Afterward, he said sorry, pulled up his pants and left. I saw blood on his jeans, shaking, I went outside to make sure he was actually getting out and close the door after as it only closed when you locked it from the inside. I was terrified, the only thing that went through my mind at that moment was that my parents were going to kill me for putting myself in that situation. I turned on the shower and it wouldn’t warm up so I started crying because I had something running down my legs and thought he had peed inside me. At that time I knew about sex but didn’t know how it actually worked? So, for months I genuinely thought he had ripped a hole somewhere and that was why I bled, but I was too afraid to touch and find out where. I got in the shower, got out, phoned my best friend and before I could ask for help he started talking about Michael Jackson as he had died a few days prior, I ended up not telling anyone anything..  
A few (maybe three) months later I had what I know now was a miscarriage and buried it under a tree in my garden because I was afraid of my parents finding something weird in the trash.  
When I was fifteen I had to quit school due to financial reasons and my mum not wanting me to go to a public middle school. My brother had a scholarship and my Nan could afford his school payment, so he continued going. I spent most of my days sleeping and pretending to read the school books I had when my parents got home and at my nan’s with my cousins.   
By December things at home were at a breaking point, one day my mum woke up, made us breakfast (which she hadn’t done for years) and at 10:30 am started screaming at my dad about how she was taking us to a different state to spend christmas with my uncle and she didn’t had the money to come back so we would stay there. My dad ignored her and she said “if you don’t want to pay attention then your daughter will hear me” hearing that, I got up, thought about closing the door but realised that it would make her angrier so I just stood in the furthest corner from the door, my mum ran inside but my dad ran past her and stood on the corridor in front of my room, my mum kept running towards my brothers room and my dad told me to grab my things and that we were going to my nan’s house, then went to tell my brother the same thing.. I took my laptop, a pair of socks and my shoes and went downstairs. I put my backpack in the car and went back inside for a pijama so I could shower there and come back home and sleep, but as I walked through the kitchen my mum grabbed a knife and walked towards me, I took a few steps back and my brother and dad entered the kitchen, she turned the knife to herself and my dad walked up to her, squeezed her hand, she dropped the knife, he put it back in the drawer, slammed it shut and screamed “what are you doing? These are your children”. My brother told her that in a month when he turned 18 she would never see him again. The dogs got into the car as they were scared with all the yelling and I did as well. My dad was getting inside to drive off when my mum started hitting my door and told me that whatever happened to her and everything that happened from that point onward would be my fault. And that day at 11 am was the last time I saw my mum and the last time I saw my house.   
She sold it along with all my things a couple months later.   
We lived with my grandma, I had no clothes so at the beginning Id wear my grandmas and then my cousins, my brother and I had no beds to sleep on so Id sleep in my dads bed, my grandmas, the couch or the hallway. Over time I got clothes, my dad started getting a little bit of money fixing computers and doing little jobs,   
I finished middle school and got to start high school... it didn’t last long, I went for a little over a semester and dropped out. I couldn’t concentrate, the letters in my books kept moving, I had panic attacks almost every day (I didn’t knew what they were) and I felt like the room was caving in, my dad couldn’t afford the school and they weren’t letting me take the tests so I decided not to go back. At that school I had a boyfriend and he was great but it didn’t work out, a little bit after that i went on vacation with a childhood friend and that was the first time I voluntarily had sex and it was followed by a panic attack on the bathroom floor of the hotel at five am and the weirdest next day which I didn’t know how to explain so i didn’t.  
I spent the next two years helping my nan by taking care of my great grandma, bathing her, dressing her, feeding her.. and she died being 100 when I was 18. Which made me get depressed as I didn’t have a clear purpose anymore. Being all that time with my nan put a strain on our relationship so, after my great grandma passed i would go to my cousin’s or my friends houses and not return for weeks.   
My uncle lived at my nans and when I was 19 he got drunk and sent me facebook messages asking me for revealing pictures while being on the room beside me, he typed the most evil things I hadn’t heard in a long time and tried to open my door twice, the whole time i was shaking trying to FaceTime a friend.   
I didn’t talk to him for years and even though i reached out for help through my cousin and she told my dad and everyone... nothing really happened and my nan not knowing the full story made me feel like i was breaking the family apart so i caved in and started speaking to him again which made me feel like whatever happens to me doesn’t really matter even though i know thats not true and it was a difficult situation for my family to handle.  
By that time i avoided going outside at all costs because i felt too aware of my surroundings and my heart was beating out of my chest, I wanted to cry and I felt too embarrassed to ask for help.  
Because of everything that was happening and me not understanding any of it I ended up looking for help in a psychiatric hospital and trying to make fun of the situation only making the people around me believe i was “faking it” and even getting mad because there’s people who are actually going through stuff like that   
I took pills and i would sleep for days and when i was awake i didn’t have strength to get out of bed, i would even pee in a bin because i didn’t have the strength to make it to the bathroom and i was afraid of my nan because i would hear her complain about me with her friends saying i was being lazy and looking for ways to get out of my responsibilities. She took me locking myself in my room and hiding from her as me being ungrateful and rude instead of afraid.. My dad came in from work (he had been working for a year now) as i was crying and i told him everything, I don’t even think he caught half of what i said because i was having a lot of trouble breathing but it was enough for him to find an apartment he could afford and we moved when i turned 20.   
Then the earthquake here in Mexico happened and every bit of strength I had gained crumbled, I felt unsafe in my own house again..   
I told my cousins about everything that happened and they tell me to look for help but i cant go get therapy and the psychologist my dad found has offer to come here but i don’t trust anyone i don’t know to come into my house and be alone with me and i cant talk about all of this with someone i know in front of me. I regret telling my family and I want my secrets back.   
I have gone out to a friends house and to my Nan’s house to visit her (she’s apologised since then) not more than ten times in two years and I’m wasting my life being here dreaming of going to uni which is literally 5 minutes away or getting a job but I cant go out and i know nothing will happen but i still cant go out, , I depend on my brother and dad 100% I cant get a job because i only finished high-school online a little over a year ago, im twenty two and i had such high hopes.. I thought I would be able to get myself out of this situation but at this point im the one pushing me in  
I know it seems like im pitying myself, I’m not, I don’t. But I’m hoping someone knows someone or is someone who knew what to do next.",nuvially,2019-04-14 05:57:29,3,3013,26.43,36.88,83.94,11.56,34.24,12.91,95.29,60.77,22.57,17.52,11.75,0.96,0.2,4.22,0.4,5.01,5.08,13.18,8.6,5.21,8.99,2.66,20.94,3.65,1.99,1.73,1.43,1.53,3.98,1.43,2.52,0.73,0.63,0.46,13.04,2.56,0.5,3.35,2.92,11.92,2.46,1.56,2.49,1.66,1.66,3.05,2.39,0.63,0.96,0.8,1.73,0.86,0.37,0.2,0.33,7.24,3.02,1.03,1.39,1.86,0.5,10.39,5.97,0.8,16.4,3.15,7.37,6.31,1.56,0.96,1.99,0.86,0.1,0.23,0.3,0.1,0.03,0.07,0.07,0.03,11.18,3.42,3.78,0.07,0,0.1,0,0.2,0.46,2.22,0.66,0.27
bd2zhv,Abusive Mothers - adult relationship problems?,"I’m now 35 years old and have not had a relationship yet. I’ve been on dates but it never goes anywhere because I feel like I don’t know what to do. The same applies for friendships too. I think people think I’m social but it’s all a mask really. 

I ran away from home when I was 15. My earliest memories are of my mother torturing me. It was confusing and getting away from her was the best thing I did. I’m now an ICU doctor so it’s quite a journey I’ve been on! 

For years I wondered why I had problems with friendships/relationships/physical contact - I thought I had autism or some other kind of mental issue but I now realise it was the abuse. 

I went out with someone about a year ago. I was so frightened all the way and it just wasn’t fun. Although I used to worry about being alone, now I’m pretty sure I’m better off by myself.

It’s really hard to find info on abusive mothers (women more generally) in our society. It makes the process of coming to terms with it much longer but I digress... the point of this post is to discus this issue and the effects it has well into adulthood.",n3xtm0v3,2019-04-14 06:57:10,5,217,20.95,12.47,99,5.81,13.56,16.13,93.09,60.83,20.28,12.9,11.98,0.46,0,0.46,0,7.37,5.53,12.9,13.36,8.76,6.45,1.84,20.28,5.07,3.23,1.38,0.92,2.3,7.37,2.76,4.61,1.38,1.84,0.46,6.91,1.38,0.46,2.3,0,17.97,4.61,2.3,0.92,4.61,1.84,5.07,0.92,0,0,0.92,1.38,0,1.38,0,0,5.07,2.3,0.92,0.92,1.38,0.92,7.83,12.9,0.46,15.21,2.3,5.99,6.45,0.46,0.46,0.46,0,0,0,0.46,0,0,0,0.46,0,17.05,7.37,0.46,0,0,0.46,0.46,0.92,0,5.53,0.92,0.92
bd50ct,I can't stand it anymore,"Triggerwarnings may include suicidal tendencies, depression, anxiety, swearing, etc.


I'm a 16 y/o teen and i've been suffering from abuse pretty much my whole life from pretty much everyone. Mainly my mom.

As far as I can remember I used to get screamed at for doing /anything/ wrong or anything she didn't like. I still am. I feel like I have no choice but to keep trying to endure it. My parents divorced when I was ten and I had to move to a town near my mom's hometown with my mom. Now that time is when shit really got bad. I don't blame my dad. If I was him, i'd just run too.

Stuff got terrible. I don't fit in at my new school, I got bullied, yada yada, my mom thinks I ""don't try enough to fit in"". I always used to get beaten both at school by my classmates and at home by my mom. Soon enough when I was in 7th grade screaming turned into degrading, terrorizing and overall it's just torture. I flinch just by seeing something move suddenly. I think I got depression (self diagnosed i guess. I wouldn't have the balls to ask for her from anyone i don't know) because of all this. I'm socially anxious and akward. I have little to no irl friends. Social media, internet-friends that I can open up to and video games are my only escape. I oftenly get anger attacks and breakdowns in return to this. 

I hate her. I hate seeing her, hearing her voice. I always refuse to go anywhere with her and my cunt of a phlegmatic stepdad that doesn't realize he's literally her bitch. Because of that she one time got so violent, she had begun to puncj me and slam my head against the wall. My eyes literally went dark for a second and at that time I just snapped and fought back, leaving her body bruised and i'm not proud. I just want this to end. I don't know if I was right to do so. She victimizes herself when speaking about me everytime. She keeps threatening me to send me away to my father or a foster home w/e but never does anything in regard to that. I feel like I want to die at this point but have no balls to do it. I tried.

Why not just ask for her from my dad, you might ask?
I don't know myself. He barely comes back here and works in a foreign country, even if I have other family there. On top of that, my mom keeps telling me that no one wants me, that my father and his side of the family doesn't care for me and no one likes me. She'd rather have me dead, she told me that. She's manipulative as fuck. Always pushing me to try and ask some money out of my dad. I never do it, though. I'm just too scared at times. I have a weird habit of rocking back and forth when sitting from time to time. I'm fucked up psychologically. You can just tell by reading this.

I see myself dead in the next five or ten years. I see myself without a future and possibly in a grave. I have no one to comfort me when I need it the most. People around me are jerks. Assholes. Selfish pricks. I hate this world and I hate me too.

Sorry for the long post but my heart is aching and I had all this bottled up for a long time.",WhatWho44,2019-04-14 10:16:09,3,607,17.68,11.47,91.73,1,11.45,12.19,93.9,59.31,23.72,18.45,14.66,0,0.33,3.46,0,5.27,2.64,13.18,8.57,6.59,7.25,3.62,19.44,2.47,1.15,1.15,1.48,1.32,7.74,1.15,6.59,0.82,3.46,0.82,10.38,2.64,0.49,3.79,1.65,11.86,1.81,1.15,1.48,4.28,1.48,3.29,2.47,1.15,0.82,0.49,1.98,1.15,0.49,0.33,0,6.26,1.32,1.32,2.14,1.32,0.66,3.79,13.84,0.82,14.5,1.81,7.41,5.6,0.99,0.66,0.66,0.16,0,0.82,1.48,1.15,0.33,0,0,0,16.97,8.4,3.13,0,0,0.16,0,0.16,0.33,3.95,0.33,0.49
bd985d,My boyfriend put his hands on me today. Im not sure how to feel.,"Earlier today, my boyfriend and I were arguing about disciplining our kids and how I feel he allows his daughter to disrespect me. Admittedly, I can get fighty sometimes and argue more than necessary because I just get so emotional but I never yell or get pointed or insulting. 
I hate yelling, and he knows this. I also dont like when people yell and step toward me or touch me in anger. 
Today he muzzled my face, really hard and yelled for me to shut up.
I asked him why he’d do that and he told me its the only way I listen. 

Im really upset. I know its my fault for starting an argument but Im so upset about it. I told him that it hurt me(physically and emotionally) and he said that he had to because I cant listen. Now Im scared hes going to do it again the next time we fight so Im trying to stay out of his way. We dont argue often, we’ve been dating two years, and nothing like this started happening until recently; the last couple times we’d argue hed yell in my face or hold my arm really tight, and then this today. 

I guess Im just venting because I have no one to talk to, so Im sorry if this breaks the board rules or isn’t the right place, I just dont know who else to talk to. If this isnt okay, I will delete.

bd9fvq,New here. Need an opinion on a situation my friend is going through. (Possible parental abuse),"So, a little background. I have this friend, we'll call her Jane. Jane and I are both 20 and we've been best friends for close to 9 years, and over the years I've had steadily growing concerns about her family and home situation. I feel like it's not my business to pry, but now that we're both in college, it seems to have gotten worse.  
Jane has struggled with depression and anxiety issues since we were in Freshman year, and although she's mostly healed from them, every now and then, it flares up again, especially during periods of high stress. Her parents knew about it, but basically figured that she could walk it off and didn't really contribute to her mental health and well being at all, (especially since her mom is one of those types who thinks medication for that kind of thing is a government conspiracy.) even during two separate suicide attempts and more than a few scares. Through all that, they just kept pushing her to do better in school and to try and get a job.  
Through the years, I've also noticed some worrying behavior from her. Whenever her mental health starts to act up, she always blames herself for it and is obviously desperately afraid of disappointing her parents, (especially her mom) saying things like ""I can't let my mom bury a failure,"" or ""If I let my mom down, I might as well be dead,"" or ""My parents raised me, and now I'm a waste of organs living off of them."" Whenever I criticize her parents' behavior for not supporting her, she gets mad at me and says that I don't understand, and that if she fails then she won't have anything to live for. Obviously, that's pretty worrying.  
As far as the behavior from her parents that worries me, well, there is the fact that they have, on multiple occasions, threatened to disown her and kick her out if she fails classes or drops below a certain GPA, and many, many, MANY, occasions where she has come to me in tears after her parents screamed at her for some trivial offense like sitting on the couch watching TV for too long. And now that she's in college, AND has a job at a fairly decent restaurant, her parents are ALSO placing the absurd expectation on her that she:  
A. Maintain the job full-time  
B. Go to university and maintain above a 3.0 GPA  
C. Finish school within four years while taking 5 classes every semester AND not failing any classes  
I'm not kidding. For two years, they've been forcing this work standard on her and every step of the way, they've been threatening to kick her out or stop paying the school if she slips on any of it. Because of this, obviously, she's been having stress breakdowns and her mental health has been deteriorating back to where it used to be, and all the way through, she keeps insisting that all her slip-ups are her fault, that she's failing her mom and dad and the rest of her family by not being the perfect golden child they want her to be.  
It honestly breaks my heart every time she comes to me with a new story about how her mom screamed at her for flubbing an essay or missing a day of work because she was having such a bad period that it was making her vomit everywhere, and it hurts even more for her to blame herself for it every single time something like that happens and insist that her parents are just pushing her because they love her, and that by failing, she's a waste of space.  
I don't know how to get through to her about this, and I don't even have any kind of experience with this sort of thing, so I'm not even 100% sure if this counts as parental abuse, even though I'm pretty sure it is. I just wish I could help her somehow.   
Any advice would be appreciated, especially on how to properly talk to her about this.",TetraQuote,2019-04-14 17:01:53,3,700,31.09,72.09,8.75,2.27,26.92,16.57,93.43,60.29,20.14,13.86,4.14,0.57,0,8,1.14,6.29,4.29,14.86,9.29,6.71,9.14,1.71,15.86,3.43,2.14,1.14,1.43,3.57,7.86,2.57,5.29,1.71,1.29,1.57,14.71,2.71,0.43,8.86,0.14,13.43,1.29,1.43,1.71,4.43,3.29,3.57,1.14,0.14,0.57,0.29,1.57,0.14,1.14,0,0.14,8.14,3,1.86,3,1.14,1.71,2.71,10.71,1.14,13.57,1.86,6.57,5.29,3.86,0.57,0.57,0.29,0,0.43,0.57,0,0.14,0,0.43,0,16,3.57,6.57,0.14,0,0,0,0.29,0.86,3.57,0.86,0.14
bdabjy,Was it abuse or am I overreacting?,"*Long post ahead*

Hey folks, this is my first time posting in this sub, so I'm not quite sure how it works. If this isn't the right place for this, feel free to let me know and I'll take it down. Before I start, tw for sex stuff and mentions of alcohol abuse. Alright, let's go.

Last year, when I was 18, I was on tinder. In my bio, I made it clear I was looking for an actual relationship. I know, tinder isn't the usual place for that, but I figured I'd try my luck and see if I found someone cool and, failing a romantic relationship, I might make a friend or two.

After a while, I was messaging back and forth with a few people who seemed really neat, including one 20 year old guy I'll call A. Not long after we started messaging, he wanted my phone number. I, being dumb, figured there'd be no harm in it. We ended up video calling all night, talking about our lives and the things we had in common. We decided to meet up for ice cream the next day, which I was nervous but excited about. We hit it off in person too and, after letting a bunch of people know where I was, I agreed to get in his car so we could drive around a bit.

Right off the bat, he kissed me. I was like 'hey, what? This is kinda fast' but, of course, I didn't say anything. I had no frame of reference for how first dates with strangers were supposed to go, as I'd only ever dated people I already knew. So I figured this was normal and just sort of let it happen. Before anything else happened, I made sure he knew I was questioning my gender (I now know I'm a trans man, but at the time I wasn't quite sure). I didn't want to lead him on or trick him or anything, and he said that was okay even though he was straight. Before the day was out, he referred to me as his girlfriend and, overlooking the warning signs, I figured there was no harm in giving it a shot.

As our relationship progressed, there were all these red flags. I remember after a while I had all these misgivings and I didn't talk about them or act on them because I was worried he'd get upset or angry or something. I didn't tell anyone else either for fear they'd get the wrong idea about him. Not only that, but I kept telling myself things were good and stuff until I believed it. I brushed over and excused all sorts of things, even things that should've been absolute dealbreakers.

For example, he didn't want me to wear my binder bc apparently I looked better without it, even though it's a major help in keeping my gender dysphoria at bay. Even though it made me extremely uncomfortable, I wore a bra instead for him. This led to an incident where he grabbed my chest outside a friend's house even though I'd asked him not to touch me there. His excuse was 'but you're so cute!' and he laughed it off. Looking back, that is 100% the most bullshit excuse ever.

And there was also time he said he liked me better drunk, even knowing I was struggling with drinking too much too frequently at the time. That one really, really messed with me. Not to mention he pressured me into sex after I said I was uncomfortable, saying things like 'for me?' and that it was a necessary part of a relationship and stuff. He'd also tell me things about how horrible his exes were, and how he was glad I'm not like that, and say things about how I'd seen him at his worst and stuck by him, so we were obviously meant to be. Stuff about how great and wonderful I was. And I thought that since he thought that, there's no way he'd purposefully treat me badly right? Right??

When he'd do stuff like that I figured 'I guess I've just gotta work on it. After all, relationships involve compromise. If I'm not a good enough partner as is then I've gotta do better'. And sometimes he'd stop doing things like the aforementioned stuff for a short time, and I'd be like 'hey, that changed. I must've done something right, so I should keep it up'. Then, of course, it'd start again and I wouldn't know what to think other than that I had to keep trying.

The relationship ended when he tried to cheat on me with one of my best friends while I was out of the province. The friend immediately told me and showed me screenshots. Still, I decided to talk to him about it. When I called him out, he admitted it and started guilt tripping me, saying things like 'it hurt me more than it hurt you', and 'the guilt makes me want to kill myself'. I asked if we could talk in person and he stopped responding to my calls and texts. After a lot of back and forth and discussion with friends who cared about me, I broke up with him over text since he wouldn't answer the phone or meet in person.

Despite all this, I feel like a lot of the problem was my responses to his behaviour. Don't get me wrong, his behaviour was definitely bad, but it wouldn't have been nearly as bad if I hadn't gone about things the way I did. I just wish I had some way of knowing if all of this was on purpose or just came from a lack of insight into his actions. Regardless, I hate how he's still about to make me second guess myself after all this time. Thinking about it makes me sick.

Up until today I never really considered it abuse, just a bad relationship. At work, I heard a song I'd listened to a lot as a kid that even then I'd recognized was clearly about an abusive relationship (Perfect by Marianas Trench) and realized 'wait. This definitely reminds me of him.' This brought up the whole question of whether or not it was an actual abusive relationship.

If anyone has any insight into this, feel free to respond. Thanks for reading all this, and my heart goes out to anyone who's been through or is in a similar spot.",chaoticAtropa,2019-04-14 18:33:17,0,1093,17.5,32.05,84.83,18.98,17.08,12.99,95.43,63.31,23.7,15.74,10.34,1.01,0.18,3.93,0.27,7.96,4.48,14.09,9.61,7.78,9.06,2.47,20.31,5.22,3.29,1.83,0.91,2.1,6.5,3.02,3.48,1.01,1.01,0.37,12.53,0.09,0.64,0,4.12,17.75,3.75,2.2,2.01,4.67,2.29,5.4,2.84,0.82,1.19,0.82,1.1,0.37,0.27,0.18,0.37,7.78,3.11,1.65,1.37,1.37,1.1,9.06,7.5,0.91,13.63,1.46,5.86,6.5,0.64,0.46,0.09,0.18,0,0.09,1.1,0.18,0.37,0.27,0,0,18.12,5.31,5.95,0,0,0.55,0.09,0,0,5.58,0.37,0.27

bdcczg,My younger brother,"I (22f) am currently living in a home with my family after a messy breakup. In the household are my two younger brothers and my mother. And in this house hold my youngest brother (18M) is very abusive towards me and my mother. To explain everything would just require me to write a book so lets just talk about what happened today.
We are in the process of moving to a new house and me, my mom and my brother (the one this story is not about). So whilst me and my brother are painting a room, my youngest brother calles my mother 67 times and threatens that if she doesnt answer he will post horrid things on facebook for our family to see as well as message her boyfriend lies to break up their relationship because my mom hadnt left him money for takeout and he demanded she send him her card info so thst he could purchase food told her she better go grocery shopping before we came home (it was 11:30pm).
So fast forward, my mom had me and my brother go pick up my other brother McDonalds so he wouldnt be in a bad mood when she got home.
Upin arriving home I gave him his food and everything was fine until he wanted to do his laundry. After loading in clothes he found out there was no money on the card and he came to me immediately. 
The Conversation:
Him: ""Go put money on the card i need to do a load""
Me: ""dude its raining out and its like twelve in the morning, do it tomorrow""
Him: "" NO when I say do it now do it now""
Me: "" Fine whatever give me five bucks and ill put money on the card""

(After that he shoved me against a wall, as his stature is much bigger than mine he tends to be very physical with me)

Him: "" I told YOU to do it""

At that point I was beyond tired and frusterated I stood up for myself and told him no. To which he ran to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and shoved me again and told me if I didnt do as he said he would pop my tires and I wouldnt be able to go to work tomorrow.

I hate that im so afraid of my younger brother, but hes so emotionally and physically abusive towards me and my mom I have no clue what to do, he wont move out due to him financually abusing my mom. I feel like there is no escape and I cant leave my mom to go through it alone.",synnplays,2019-04-14 22:21:06,2,448,20.74,60.57,54.33,7.63,32,14.51,94.2,62.05,24.55,19.64,11.16,0.89,0.22,7.14,0.22,4.91,4.02,13.62,8.26,5.13,9.15,2.9,17.41,5.36,4.02,1.34,1.34,0.22,3.57,0.89,2.46,0.67,1.34,0.22,17.63,4.46,0.45,3.57,7.81,5.8,1.34,0.45,2.01,0.45,0.45,2.01,1.12,0.22,0.45,0.45,2.23,0.22,1.12,0,0.89,7.37,4.69,0.67,1.34,0.45,0.67,5.36,10.94,0.89,16.29,4.46,6.03,6.03,1.12,1.12,2.68,1.79,0,0,0.45,0,0,0,0.22,0,10.49,2.9,1.56,1.56,0,0,0,0,2.23,0,2.23,0
bdczdz,Hear me out,"(TEXT WALL) I am 13M and my mother is 57 my father passed away when I was 11 and she has been (physically?)/emotionally abusive. She will take money from me saying ""you owe me"" and when I ask for the money back she will say ""I put a roof over your head and pay the bills around here. Isn't that payment enough?"" Keep in mind she works a job where she makes $24 an hour. (She'll take $20-65 from me) then guilt trip me spewing bs. And the 3 times I have stood up to her she will hit me above the ear with an open palm about as hard as you would hit a glass bottle against a wall to break it. She will also hit me or yell at me if I don't do something perfectly. Just last week she said (and I quote) ""YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING RIGHT, GOD FORBID I WANT TO COME HOME AND SIT DOWN FOR 10 SECONDS. BUT NOOOO NEED TO TELL YOU TO DO SOMETHING THE CORRECT WAY FOR THE FITH TIME."" Why she yelled at me you may ask? For not putting the spoons/forks with their head up in the drying rack. This is only one account of abuse that has happened. 



And if I try to stand up for myself? I get the ""WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE TALKING TO ME LIKE THAT?"" Or the "" I am so done with you right now I can't even think straight."" Also sliding in the ""how could someone be so disrespectful to say that"" 

All in all I can't deal with it anymore. As I stated before my father passed away when I was 11. My neighbors are very supportive and when I turn 14 June third I am going to try to move over there. I can't deal with her control freak ways anymore. I can't find a time when she said ""good job (my name.) Can't find a time when I had an enjoyable conversation with her. That's it.

bdhsx9,Processing Previous relationship,"Last year I was in a relationship, and I'm not sure how to feel/process some of the things that went on. 

My ex was raped and abused as a child by his father and often used his childhood to reinforce how much he hated abusers/rapists. 

Prior to us getting into a relationship, he was over at my house drinking and got black out drunk. He choked me against the wall and on my bed almost to the point of me passing out. I nearly called a mutual friend to ask for help but he passed out before the situation escalated. The next morning he had no recollection of it and was passive about it so I shrugged it off. 

We continued dating. At first things were great, but I avoided letting him drink around me. We then developed a lot of issues sexually. I felt like he would pressure me into having sex when I told him I didn't want to. If I told him no he would be in a bad mood the rest of the day until I consented. 

In our sex, I would often have to use my safe word and would be brought to tears, and I can remember at least once where I told him not to do something sexually and he did it anyway. Our sex life, or lack thereof, was often what we argued about and eventually led to me breaking up with him bc my sex drive got so low and my depression kept getting worse. 

I haven't spoken about this with any mutual friends about this. I have put distance between me and the people I know that still are friends with him. I honestly feel like I'm overreacting, but also embarrassed I allowed myself to be in this toxic relationship for 7 months.  

It has been on my mind recently because a mutual friend told me my ex is going to beat up a guy both of us know who was arrested for abusing his wife. I think I'm angry because he's championing around as a white knight when he also got drunk and choked me?

I just feel conflicted and I'm not sure how to talk about it with my friends.",grvpejuice,2019-04-15 09:08:59,0,377,31.11,54.23,75.81,2.45,18.85,14.06,94.69,62.33,22.02,17.77,10.88,1.86,0,5.04,0,4.24,4.51,16.18,8.49,6.9,9.28,1.86,16.98,2.92,2.12,2.12,0.8,1.59,6.1,1.59,4.24,0.8,2.12,0.8,14.85,0.53,1.59,0.27,5.84,12.47,2.39,2.65,1.86,2.92,0.53,2.92,1.86,0.53,0.27,1.06,4.24,0,1.06,2.12,1.06,10.61,5.04,0.8,2.65,1.59,1.33,8.49,7.43,0.8,15.92,2.39,7.16,6.37,0.53,1.06,0.53,0,0,0,1.06,0,0.27,0,0,0.27,9.55,4.77,2.12,0,0,0.27,0,0,0,1.86,0,0.53

bdkx8z,"Needing to abandon my mother otherwise, our relationship will be ruined forever. Having severe PTSD/Anxiety that she will prevent me from leaving.","I originally posted this in:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bb4kn9/needing\_to\_abandon\_my\_mother\_otherwise\_our/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bb4kn9/needing_to_abandon_my_mother_otherwise_our/) 

**Backstory:** Sorry it is a long one. I have had severe anxiety, PTSD, and depression since I was 4 years old when I was locked in a closet 24/7 by my fathers girlfriend who mentally abused me, physically, and molested me with her friends (*If you want to know what happened after let me know*). At the age of 15, ma and I had to leave everything behind to escape from my sister who threatened to hurt us. We went from shelter to shelter and by the time we found an apartment we were mentally fucked. We both suffer from ptsd and having two minds like that clash caused us to be mentally abusive with each other (*at first*). She would constantly threaten to kick me out since the age of 16 (*I am 22 now*) whenever I did something wrong. Ever since that age, I have been always scared every day on whether or not I will be kicked out. Now when I was 17-18 years old she became bed bound. She can walk, but only short distances with assistance depending on how her body is doing because of this I became her caretaker at age 17. Constantly helping her and putting her first instead of my own. This has put a mental toll on me because when I was in high school I always had a 3.5 GPA, in college a 3.2 GPA, but had to drop out because the stress of taking care of my mother was getting too much for me mentally and physically. I would be the only one doing the cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, walking the dogs, going with her to her doctor appointments,etc. None of it is appreciated (*by the way I am mentally and physically disabled so it took a toll on my body too so I couldnt get a job*) because she says it is her money why should be appreciate anything I do by spending her money? That is what she says, I am like I use my time to take care of you, I don't have to, but I do it because I care. This mentally took a toll on me by making my conditions worse and causing me to stop caring for my future and the health of the apartment which resulted in us to get roaches. The constant stress has had me get another disorder called Disassociation Disorder where it is hard to connect with myself with reality and others. It has gotten so bad that when I tried to leave she has gotten physical with me to get my phone to prevent any communication with people to help me leave (she has done this too many times to count). One time this happened she got physical with me, slapped me, clawed me, grabbed my hair, got on top of me, then my fight or flight instincts kicked in and ended up hitting her on the head twice because I was so scared. She went limp and I tried to make sure she was okay and helped her back to bed. Shit like this has had me scared ever since. Reminder her and I would curse at each other, but my mother went beyond that...Even though my mom is disabled I have seen her fight off people full strength that hits like a man because of her neuropathy which causes her muscles to be tight all the time which also gives you super strength that makes you hit like a man. She even prevented from bringing my stuff because it was hers even though my expensive stuff I bought with my money was mine, but she said it was hers since it was through her card, so I was stuck.

**Currently:** She signed the lease online pretending to be me and signed my name herself online. I understand she is bedridden, but recently she told me that I am a sociopath and have no hope for me getting better (*summed up version*). I wanted to take her electric chair (*currently hard to walk because of my problems crippling me*) drive down to the huge canal and drive off of it. I have never really attempted suicide, but at that moment I just wanted peace. Luckily after a card reading (*I was told to follow love for myself or anothe*r) and god listening peace has shown up... Right now I am so scared of leaving because of what my mother has done to me in the past. My best friend of 10 years (*boyfriend of 4 years of when we were children, currently dating again as of March 28th*) has offered me to move in with him. I am going to have to leave everything behind except the stuff I bought, not ever all the stuff I bought, just the most important. I am so petrified that she will find me and have me arrested for something I didn't do. I don't care if I have to pay an exit fee, but I doubt I have to since she has housing and I am not on it. I know she has services that can get her an in-home nurse to help her.

**Questions:** Do you think I am in the wrong? Do you think I could possibly be arrested for just up and leaving? Do you think I can get arrested for infesting an apartment with roaches and leaving?

**Conclusion?:** I mean I am willing to pay money if they say I owe it, but legally I mean. I just am scared to be in this apartment one more day.

bdm235,Question about how to overcome child physical abuse?,"I was beaten badly as a little girl by my mother as well as occasionally my father. Here are some of the things that happened: 

1. struck on face by mother at 5 years old when I answered her question that I took my allergy medicine as needed
2. whipped in a strong whipping fashion by mother with a belt (30 lashes at a time for 10 minute beatings) while she was screaming at me at age 6-13
3. pinched very hard (with his nails) by my dad from age 5-14 for just sitting down or coming near him or any time he came up to me
4. pushed by my dad so hard I fell on my back age 15
5. chased in the house for beatings by my dad
6. pulled by braids by mother and pulled down the hall like my braids were a leash

This has over the years made me very aggressive, reactive, on edge, irritable, and angry which I dont like.

bdmz56,"Is this abuse and/or manipulation? Me: 28M, her: 27F.","Note: post removed from r/relationships. directed to post here.

TL;DR: Due to a messed up childhood, not trusting myself, I need someone to tell me if my fiancée is abusive and/or manipulative. Is it giving up if I leave her? Is my gut right on this?

Hi all, throwaway account because she stalks my other one.

I'm needing some advice, and just someone I can talk to.

Background history: My fiancée and I have been together for just over 3 years. We bought a house together a year ago. We already started planning our wedding for later this year.

My background history: My childhood was very toxic growing up. My parents were/are addicted to crack, there was severe neglect, abuse, and manipulation that went on until I got the hell out of there at 18. Needless to say this fucked me up. Growing up, and even when I was still speaking to my mum, she would say things like: ""we loved you and your siblings"", ""the abuse never happened"", ""we did the best we could"". This also fucked with me, because I believed her for the longest time, didn't trust myself, and put all of the blame on me.

Working through all this and taking space from my mum allowed me to have a mind shift. My mum is wrong, in all ways. She abused me, she didn't love me, it wasn't my fault, she was not a good parent, and it all came down to her choices.

My fiancée knows everything about my childhood. I've had to set boundaries (reasonable, healthy ones, or so I thought) in our relationship, and she's repeatedly broken them. Space is a huge coping mechanism I've learned from counselling and she refuses to let me have it. There have been times where she has physically blocked the door when we are fighting, and times where she's grabbed me to pull me back. I've also expressed to her that I will not be with anyone that is verbally or physically abusive.

She says she's not and it fucks with me due to my history. Help me out reddit friends.

\- she refuses to give me space, makes me feel bad about taking it, is this manipulative?

\- she says things like fuck you, fuck off, you're such a fucking asshole, etc. threatens to leave, and then says that she has no control over herself and I make her get to this point, again, is this abuse and/or manipulative?

\- it has gotten physical a couple of times, she's thrown something at me (a pillow) but it was when we were fighting and it triggered me to push her away, which made her blame me for grabbing her

\- I've also had to physically move her out of the way to get out when she's trapped me, and once when I was trying to drive away she would not get away from the car, again accusing me of trying to run her over

Do all couples go through things like this, is this normal? It may seem simple of me to ask, but because of my past I'm all over the place. She repeatedly disrespects my boundaries, and then when she sees that I am serious about leaving, she says okay I'll do this, this and this, to work on myself and fix things. It never happens.

She says things like she can't live without me, she doesn't want to be without me, wants to spend all her time with me, and that she puts all her energy into making me happy. I can't breathe! When we are not fighting, we are fine, but I don't even know if this is a healthy relationship to begin with.

She has issues, we both do, this I know. But my gut is telling me that this isn't going to get any better. Marriage isn't going to change it, and neither are kids. And I am NOT bringing children into an environment like this.

Lastly, I've wanted to join the military my whole life, and have been in and out already. She knew this from day one, before we even started talking. She disagrees with everything having to do with the military, we've fought about it many times. I've compromised by joining the reserves, but what I really want to do is go full time and make it a career. This is not the first time that I've held back from joining because of a girl in my life. I don't want to have any regrets, and I know I will if I don't do this now. I just feel like I'm done, she doesn't respect me or love me in my opinion, and the shit she is doing is bringing up things from my childhood and really messing with my head. I don't trust her anymore.

It comes down to me being scared of finding anyone else to love me if I leave, due to all my baggage. I feel bad for her, the same way I felt bad for my mum, but it comes down to choices and I honestly don't see her trying to get better. My mental health is suffering because of this.

bdmzz8,"I can't see the difference between her and her exes anymore. Even after all of the abuse, and the heartbreak, she became them.","It's heartbreaking, because she used to be such an amazing person. I believe she's still in there somewhere, but this is someone else at the helm. Anyway, at first I saw a lot of parallels between what she told me about her exes over the years, and the behaviors she's exhibited in the last year and a half or better. Now, it just seems like she has emulated them.

We are supposed to learn from our exes, not become them. She's a survivor of some awful, terrible things, and I expected so much more of her because of that. The one was a toxic repeat abuser who cheated on her, and did so many terrible things. The other, no matter how much she tried and cared for him, chose weed over her, and suffered from substance abuse and using drugs and alcohol as a coping mechanism. Now, I just don't see the difference between them. Fortunately, all I think she took from me is my boldness.

I wish her well, and I hope she corrects these behaviors. As much as she seems to hate me, I don't wish anything bad upon her. I still believe she's in there somewhere, and I think that if she could resurface, she would realize all of this, and I think she would fix herself. Not for me, or for anyone else, but for herself.

bdnxm4,Hard time dealing with breakup - even though he was abusive.,"I (M, 24) just recently broke up a 2 year relationship with D (also M, 24).

He was always very needy, and overly present (he wanted us to spend every second together, was extremely jealous of me going out without him, even with friends), but other than that we had a deeper connection than I ever managed with anyone, so I valued our relationship highly.

Very early on in our relationship, (&lt;1 month in) he caught me talking to other guys on grindr. I was very depressed at the time and made a terrible mistake. Even though we had no clear boundaries and I never intended on going forward with anything, the act itself was quite horrible and I apologized (many, many, many times) for it.

From that incident forward it became clear to me how important the sense that we were exclusive for each other was for him.(how we were made for each other and we had a deeper connection than anyone else.) He truly believed this, and I guess it made me believe it too.

His need for control and his insecurities also began to become more pronounced, slowly normalizing more and more invasive behavior.

First, it was the constant video calls when we weren't together (think 3-5 times a day), then demanding to read my messages, saying it was unfair to him for me to go out with my friends without him. I've accepted this behaviour, mainly because I felt guilty of my earlier, adulterous behaviour. Then I found out he had made accounts on grindr and other apps with the intention of always trying to find me.

I also made a trip with my parents and later found out he was pretty much 24/7 trying to find me on grindr while I was away, totally paranoid the whole time. I get how my behaviour influenced this, and I never did anything like that ever again, but at this point(18 months into the relationship) his complete freakouts over fidelity were starting to get to me.

This led me to eventually alienating the few remaining friends I had after my depression, counting on him as my sole support.

Then it all came to a breaking point: One day in my place, I told him (not nearly expecting this type of reaction) that five years prior to meeting D, I had once drunkenly kissed one of my (straight) friends. D completely lost it, was totally enraged and started punching me, threatening to kill himself since I had ""embarassed"" him, because we once and out and this straight friend of mine was there. He eventually broke a lot of shit in my home and I had to call the police to help me get him out of the house. He was threatening me and tried to choke me.

Still aparently this wasn't enough for me, since somehow I told myself this was all my fault, that maybe I should have handled everything better, etc. So I got in contact with him, APOLOGIZED (yes, after being beaten and threatened to death in my own home) and we got back together.

Fast forward 5 months, things were actually going better he was trying to be more in control of his possessive urges.

Until last thursday, where we had a small argument over him leaving me hanging for our lunch date, and he completely lost it again. We argued for a bit and I said I wanted some space and wanted to go home. He had to go to his house anyway, so this wasn't an issue. But he was clearly upset that I was annoyed with him and his insecurities took over. He hopped on my bus, followed me home and tried to grab me many times in the middle of the streets, even ripping my shirt. This was my breaking point, and I told him that I couldn't be with someone who can't control these urges.

Queue, many many more suicide threats and this is where I am. 5 days after breakup and the issue is I still care and worry about him. Even though he could be this nasty, nasty human being to me I still feel I am somehow responsible for his whole behaviour, and it's all killing me.

Please help, I can't seem to deal with all of this. I have very mixed feelings about him, my rational side reminds me of the horrible things he's done, but my emotions just tell me I miss him.

(Sorry it's this long, just started typing and got to this, kinda flustered)

TLDR: Boyfriend caught me talking to another guy few weeks into our relationship. He leveraged this into normalizing a lot of toxic behaviour, and eventually got to a point where he was so possessive he was being phisically abusive.

Still having a hard time not blaming myself for everything, or getting over my feelings for him.",feellikeblurtingout,2019-04-15 18:15:25,1,832,29.51,50.48,76.02,1,23.11,17.43,92.79,59.01,22.72,16.23,9.25,1.8,0,5.17,0,6.49,3.37,13.7,7.21,7.21,6.85,1.56,15.87,4.81,2.52,0.96,2.16,3.49,6.25,1.32,4.81,1.44,2.16,0.96,12.62,0.12,1.2,0,5.53,13.94,2.04,2.52,1.08,2.64,2.76,3.25,1.56,0.36,0.24,0.84,0.72,0.24,0.24,0,0.24,9.5,4.33,1.32,3,1.32,0.6,9.5,4.45,1.2,16.95,2.88,7.21,7.93,0.72,0.36,0.72,0.24,0,0.48,0.84,0.24,0.36,0.12,0,0.12,15.5,4.45,5.89,0.24,0.12,0,0,0.24,0.24,1.2,2.88,0.24
bdphje,Is this considered abuse?,"I know the word 'abuse' is being thrown around here and there and I'm not in the very right state of mind, I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost 2 years ago, I got in a relationship. It was mostly long distance. He lived in a different state, we only met a year after of long-distance. We finally broke up last month for good and it was very messy!

&amp;#x200B;

During this duration, I was called names such as sl\*t, ho\* and gold-digging bi\*\*\* who craves for men's attention so much. Anyway, I was not very happy with this guy and tried to break-up with him a couple of times. However, whenever I tried to break-up, he would always bring up about his personal problems and that I am a horrible person for leaving him during a life crisis. In other words, we were on-off.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, during our fights, he would always say insulting things and take back all the gifts he had given me because according to him, the money used for the gifts were his so it was only rightful for him to take them back. This does not make sense to me because it has never happened to me before with any of my previous relationships. But he was able to justified it and I listened to his reasoning. Whenever we would fight, he would kick me out from group chats with friends and un-invite me to events (lol). I called him out for his unpleasant behavior and he mentioned that he only said those things because I hurt him and made him angry.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of months before we finally broke up, I met someone else, I did, in a way, cheat on him. I tried to break up with him again saying I met someone else. He told me I was a bi\*\*\* and a sl\*\* for liking someone else while being in a relationship with him and that I had to break it off with this person because I never tried to work things out with him and that if I really felt sorry for 'cheating' I need to stay and work things out with him. And so, I did, but unwillingly.  


So a couple of weeks later, I decided to get with this guy and dump my ex, for real. My ex couldn't accept it. So what he did, he messaged my new guy, showing evidence that I agreed to work things out with him. New guy left me because of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I messed up as well, by agreeing to work things out with him while I was not sincere about it. But now, I am not sure if I got 'abused' or I was just an as\*hole just like what ex said to me and has been saying to our mutual friends and that I deserved that because I am a cheap ho\*.",hjktssg,2019-04-15 21:02:02,1,500,33.28,61.81,54,7.37,20,10.4,92.8,64.4,23.2,16,8.6,1.4,0,5.8,0.2,7.2,3.8,16.8,6.6,7.2,9,1.6,15.6,3.4,1.8,1,0.2,1.4,5.8,2,3.6,0.2,1.8,0.8,15.4,0,1.2,0,6.8,11.6,2.2,2.2,1.8,2,1.2,3.6,2,0.2,1.2,0.4,0.8,0,0.4,0.4,0,9,3.6,2.2,1.6,1.2,0.4,9.2,5.4,0,14.8,1.2,7,6.4,0.8,0.2,0,0.4,0,0,1.2,0,0.2,0,0.2,0.2,22.2,4.6,5,0,2,0.2,0.2,1.2,0,1.8,0.4,6.8
bdpkt8,Abusive friends,"So, just recently I dealt with a loss of a ""friend"" group, about four or five people who I thought I could trust turned their backs on me, blocked me on everything but gave me a fake smile in real life. Whenever I would bring it up with them, they would tell me they just needed a break, which didn't make any sense to me because as far as I could tell, I hadn't done anything to *them* (however, I had gotten into a fight with a mutual but they were in no way involved in that event). I heard them talk about me behind my back, calling me a bitch and stupid and fat (which is funny to me considering that they all know I've been struggling with bulimia for six years now, and I'm smaller than any of them are). One of these people had previously given me trouble by calling me abusive and manipulative when I told her I didn't want to be friends anymore after she cancelled plans on me, last minute, five times in a row. She really made me hate myself and genuinely wonder if I was abusive and manipulative like she said.

I'm still in high school, so I see these people in the hallways but luckily I don't share any classes with them. I do, however, sit with three of them at lunch, one of them (the worst of the bunch) sits directly across from me. He has stolen money, an expensive calculator, and attempted to steal my phone from me. What's worse is that any time I move, I immediately start to hear them talk about me, about how pathetic I am and that I can't handle them. I mean in reality I used to play hockey, I've knocked out a girl's teeth before and I'm not afraid to do it again, but what gets to me most is the way they insult me because I'm transgender (FTM). The boy that sits across from me is also trans, and I actually helped him come out when I still thought we were friends. Now, I hear him try to say I'm not really a boy, that I'm just faking being trans for attention.

But the worst thing - my best friend still sees them as friends. She tells me that she doesn't want me to move, but she doesn't want them to leave either. I've asked her if she and I could just go sit with other people together, but she told me that she still wanted to be friends with them. She knows what they've said about me and how one of them stole from me and used me, but she still insists on being friends with them. I don't want to make her pick a side but I want to be healthy, too. I want *her* to be healthy. I've already seen them try to take advantage of her by taking her money without her permission. Whenever she would get upset, they just said they would pay her back (they don't). I really genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I'm a junior and I know that I'll never see them again after high school, but there's still a chance I'll be forced to be around them my senior year too.

bdqif5,My abuse may be affecting my relationship,"When I was a teenager, I ended up living in a very unhealthy environment. My mother's boyfriend was an alcoholic and drug user. My mother was neglectful. We had fleas and I was constantly being eaten up by them. I still have over a hundred scars from the bites and a fear of fleas. I suffered from anxiety and depression and the meds were no longer helping me cope. I moved in with my father and step-mom my senior year. Things were good at first. Then the arguments started. Some were stupid arguments that teens have with their parents, but it started to become abusive. My step-mother would call me lazy and worthless for being a full-time student in highschool. She yelled at me about the most minor things. I once forgot to take out the trash (which I did every single day) and she literally yelled at me for a solid hour. When my little brother (who is special needs) had his first baseball game, I stayed behind to get some house work done to make my parents happy. Me and him discussed it and he was okay with it because i promised to attend every game after that (which I did). My step-mother proceeds to call me a bad sibling and said that I wouldn't be able to take care of him if they died. Another time she accused me of not loving him because I wouldn't volunteer at the Special Olympics in our city. I had severe social anxiety at the time but that wasn't a good excuse according to her. 

All of that sucked, but it was nothing compared to what happened a year ago. I had revealed to a friend that I was having suicidal thoughts and she told our college counselor. They contacted my father and he asked me why I didn't tell him. I stated that i had told him and my step-mom multiple times, but they never did anything to get me help. All they gave me was empty promises. He left for work and didn't say much. When my step-mom got home, she started yelling at my brother for not being able to wipe himself  (not his fault) and then yelled at me for 3 hours. She called me a liar, a spoiled brat, and claimed that my depression was my own fault. It was the worst day of my life and I still suffer from severe issues because of it. I ended up moving back to my mom's hometown after she cleaned up her act and we reconciled. I met a beautiful girl and began living with her. She's the one that made me realize how abusive my step-mother and dad actually were and she's helped me through so much. But ever since I moved back, I've had to deal with a lot of drama with my dad and step-mom. It's caused my mental health to get worse and I've been having more frequent depression spells, I've been very frustrated, and I've been very irritable. My gf also suffers from depression and I feel like I haven't been a good girlfriend to her. I just want to make her happy and I feel like what they put me through is stopping me from truly treating her the way she deserves to be treated.",SeleneTheCape,2019-04-15 23:14:36,2,565,25.28,47.88,65.33,1,16.14,15.4,94.69,59.82,23.36,18.94,12.21,0.71,0,4.78,1.24,4.42,4.6,12.04,9.91,3.72,7.79,2.12,19.65,3.54,1.77,1.77,1.24,2.48,8.85,2.65,6.19,0.71,2.3,1.77,15.75,3.36,0.71,4.96,3.19,9.38,1.24,1.95,1.06,1.24,1.77,2.48,1.77,0.35,1.06,0.35,1.42,0,1.24,0,0.35,9.56,3.72,1.42,1.95,1.59,1.06,11.15,6.55,0.53,13.27,1.77,5.13,6.9,1.24,0.88,0.35,0,0,0.35,0.53,0.18,0.18,0.18,0,0,13.45,6.02,1.95,0,0,0,0,1.42,0,2.65,1.42,0

bdxl67,"I think I was emotionally abused, I don't know what to do","So I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years in 2017. We were in an LDR. I left because I was unhappy but I never considered anything he did abusive. Since then, I've made many new friends and whenever I tell them about my ex they respond with concern and tell me that he was really messed up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've doubted this for so long for many reasons. The first being that we were both fairly young. We started dating when I was about 14 and he was 15. I broke it off right before I turned 18, so I thought maybe we were both just dumb kids that didn't know enough about relationships. He is also severely mentally ill (severe depression, anxiety, BPD, etc.) so I thought a lot of his actions were because of that and he shouldn't be accused of abuse. He also asked me, many many times, if I felt like he was abusing me, and of course I would say no. He often told me that people with BPD are wrongly accused of being abusers and I didn't want to add to that.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently though I've been thinking about it a lot, because a lot of his actions left me with some... lasting side-effects, I guess? Like for example, he used to get really upset with me when I fell asleep while staying up late with him, so for a LONG time after leaving him I would wake up in a panic, just by association. I'm in a different (much better) relationship now, and I've found myself getting really paranoid that my boyfriend now will get upset with me like my ex did about things, but he never does. I went through a massive list of ""signs of emotional abuse"" to see how much aligned and it was... a lot. Here's just a few things, because I still don't know if this is abuse or just a bad match/relationship:

Belittling my interests (until my interests aligned with his), keeping me from friends and family, guilting me, being extremely jealous of me, belittling my accomplishments, blaming me for his personal issues, accusing me of abusing him, forcing me to make sacrifices for him &amp; getting nothing in return, telling me I didn't have a personality, threatening suicide.... He also really didn't want me to go to college, and instead wanted me to move away with him. I agreed at the time, but now I think it's kind of freaky. Also, I lied to him a lot, because when I told him certain things he would get really upset so I found it easier to lie. When I broke up with him and told him this he accused me of being a horrible person and a liar (all on his public blog).

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know. I doubt it because when I hear about abusive relationships, it involves more personal attacks and insults towards the abused person, but he never really did stuff like that. If he did, it was really subdued, like telling me I don't have a personality. I was also the one to break up with him, and I usually hear about abusers getting tired of their victims and leaving them instead. I don't know. This is all really scary and I don't know what to do with this information. I'm terrified to call him an abuser because he said if he found out I said anything like this he would hurt himself, or try to hurt me, I forget the specifics but it was a threat. I just want some closure I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you if you read it all.",youcantlikepink,2019-04-16 11:46:57,5,635,14.78,31.28,62.03,1,18.68,16.38,93.23,62.2,23.78,18.74,11.65,0.63,0.31,5.51,0.63,5.04,3.78,13.39,8.98,8.5,8.98,2.52,19.21,3.94,2.05,1.42,1.1,3.31,8.82,1.1,7.4,2.05,3.31,1.26,13.07,0.16,0.63,0,5.83,15.43,3.15,2.2,2.2,4.09,1.57,4.41,1.42,0.16,0.79,0.47,0.63,0.31,0.31,0,0,6.46,2.36,0.63,1.73,1.26,0.94,7.24,8.98,0.31,11.34,1.57,4.41,5.35,0.79,0.31,0.16,0,0.16,0.16,0.63,0.31,0,0,0,0,20.16,6.14,5.83,0.16,1.42,0.16,0,0.16,0.31,3.15,1.26,1.57
bdz90s,is this sexual abuse/molestation?,"I'll start with the very first thing that I remember about this topic, which happened when I was 4-5. I woke up to someone touching and rubbing in between my thighs and between my legs, all over the lower part of my body really. I remember the feeling of coco butter, my mom always kept it in the house. I woke up on the couch not understanding a strange touch that made my skin jerk back and it would tingle and tickle in a way. I don't know if I fell asleep or what but I woke up that morning covered in the sick, sticky, oily feeling of cocobutter all over my legs/inner thighs/feminine areas. 

Until 11 months ago I never thought much of the memory and when I did think of it I never went into depth, it would just blow over my head and I'd move on. After I (14 at the time) told my boyfriend (16 at the time) what happened, that night I didn't stop thinking about all of the things that the person did to me, this memory crossed my mind again. I had a horrible realization and everything crashed down on me. My boyfriend was asleep at the time so I texted my best friend that I'd had a horrible realization but I ended up deleting the message because of my disgust. I didn't know what to do so I sat there and cried/shook for a while. Now every time I think about it (about twice a day) I just feel so weird, it feels strange and wrong but I can't come to an answer if I was touched wrongly or what. The next morning I told my SO and he said it was probably just a memory and even though I was a child my mind could have still dreamt it. I felt a little distraught at the answer, like I was a little lost, because I knew I woke up with the feeling of oil all over me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The person who did it also touches me regularly, but it's lessened over time because I try to avoid as best as I can. I hate to admit that my dad does this stuff to me and it makes me sick typing it out but it also releases a lot of stress too. 

&amp;#x200B;

In about early 6th grade, my mom left to live in another state and I believe this is when it started regularly happening. My dad would give me compliments like ""your legs look so good in those pants"", ""you're the hottest girl here"", ""your butt looks so big in these jeans"" and it would always make me really uncomfortable. If he knew I shaved he'd make me let him feel my legs and rub them which seems really weird, but in 6th grade I just kind of let it happen because I thought it was normal. 

I don't remember much from this time besides the compliments and wanting to touch my legs but another thing was when I would use the bathroom and run out of toilet paper I'd yell for some and I'd tell him through the door to not look because.. duh? but instead every time he'd stare at me using the bathroom and I felt really uncomfortable. I stopped asking for stuff after another time with a towel and it made me feel disgusting. 

&amp;#x200B;

7th grade was a blur, but when I started 8th grade, I remember specifically over winter, it started happening more. He'd walk by where I was sitting and rub my leg for a second or pet my hair or when I was standing in the kitchen he'd come by and like.. pat by butt which made me angry. These things still happen now but I'm more aggressive in how I handle it. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was one day where we went to the store which was my final straw and that's when I started heavily avoiding him. I was sitting in the car waiting for him to get out, and I was wearing some sort of flowery off-the-shoulder shirt with white shorts. When he sat down he started rubbing my thigh for too long and I told him to stop and when he didn't I got more angry and pushed him away. He yelled at me and said ""maybe you shouldn't wear shit like that then"" and I felt horrible. I got home and locked myself in my room. 

This put me in a horrible mood for over a week because it bothered me so badly and my SO noticed and asked what was wrong. He made me tell him and I spilled everything that had happened over time. He tried his best to help me with comforting but there's only so much you can do in a LDR but I'm still thankful. 

&amp;#x200B;

At one point my dad had to go to a different state for work so my grandma was with me for a week. We went shopping for a bathing suit and I picked one out that my grandmother called ""skimpy"" and she demanded to send a picture of my chest to my dad and I felt like crying because if she'd known what was going on she wouldn't have made me take a picture. I was allowed to get it and that evening was when he got home. My grandma and dad were trying to get me to try on my new clothes in front of my dad but I refused many times and they eventually stopped bothering me. 

That night my dad got really drunk (he drinks every night but more when he knows someone will take care of him, he always has) and when I sat on the couch with him he reached into the arm hole of my shirt while laughing like it was funny and tried to grab at my chest. I got up really fast and went to the bathroom. My chest hurt so bad and I felt gross and nasty. I didn't have access to my razor blade (sorry this sounds bad) at the time so i scratched up my arm with a screwdriver to get the feeling out of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

He always comes to say goodbye to me in the morning and once he came in and started rubbing up and down my side. In my half asleep state I started crying and saying ""no more no more"". I know this because he told me laughing that afternoon and it bothered me.

Another morning he came in and did the same thing but tried to kiss my neck and stuff and it was really weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are the few instances that pop into my head on first thought that really bothered me but there are lots of other things that I can't remember right now, I don't want to think super deep into this. 

As of now I only get like.. lingering looks when I walk away from him, or when I turn my back to walk off I'll look behind me and he's looking up and down my body and it makes me so angry I don't know what to do. Or he'll pet me when he's walking by if I'm eating dinner. I tell him repeatedly that I really dislike it but he doesn't listen even when I get really angry at him for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are also really fucked up things he believes in like that 13-17 year old girls are in their ""most prime age for fertility"" or some weird shit and that irritates me, especially because I'm 15. I'm going to sound like a troll but he believes in borderline incel beliefs like: rape isn't rape if you don't say no/don't defend yourself, women shouldn't vote, girls should be married and having children at 14 years old. 

This used to happen when I was in middleschool- when I'd have school events he'd point out different girls and talk about how good they look or how their boobs/ass were and it was just really gross. This was 6th-8th grade girls and that's really nasty. 11-14 yearolds. I told him it's wrong but he'd just get mad and defend himself with the ""fertility"" bullshit. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this really messes with me and makes me really angry. A lot of it is the reason I've selfharmed- cutting/burning/punching/biting etc. I've also done several easy-to-get drugs like DPH, weed, and DXM. I begged my 2 friends who were doing heroin for some, I'd even pay for a small amount, so I could do it once and keep the rest in case I needed to overdose. I've taken over 1000mg twice, one was an attempt to alarm my dad to get me help but I ended up pussying out of it and trying to puke but I couldn't so it turned into a recreational thing and I rode it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

be224z,Just realized my husband is emotionally abusive,"It takes me a long time to realize when I am being abused. I'm neurodivergent and it is hard for me to tell what is acceptable behavior and what isn't. My husband is also neurodivergent so I think I tended to dismiss his behavior as misunderstandings. But I have come to realize that he is passive aggressive. He won't tell me what he wants or he'll agree to something and then do something to lash out at me or make things unpleasant. He has made comments about my weight. It feels like he doesn't want me around but also like he doesn't want me to go. He has told me that he would kill himself if I left him. 

I am especially hurt right now because he came out as bi and I was excited to share that with him. I'm bi too. We talked about going shopping together to find things that could help us express our bisexuality. I was especially excited because I never really felt like he was interested in my bisexuality, so I was looking forward to us supporting each other. He seemed a bit uncomfortable when I shared that I felt like I had to heighten my femininity to make up for my sexuality. Maybe he couldn't handle hearing about my sexuality. But he agreed to go shopping together to start experimenting with our clothes. It would be our coming out clothes. And then he went and did it on his own. On our anniversary. He claims he didn't think it would be a big deal because he didn't shop in the section of the store we had talked about. I also found posts where he talked about not being able to experiment sexually at the moment and getting married because dating was hard. I confronted him about it and his immediate reaction was to get mad at me for not being understanding of how dating was a nightmare for him. Happy anniversary to me! 

8 years and it's been the same cycle of trying to get him to stop being hurtful to me. It wasn't until now that I was able to put ""abuse"" to what he has been doing to me. I am feeling really bad about myself. But I am also proud that I've identified what this is. I put together a list of articles for him to read about abuse today. But I also watched some videos for myself and I think they helped me realize that I can't change him. He has to want to change. He keeps telling me he wants to be with me, but he is clearly just scared of being alone. We are going to try therapy. I'm not sure if it's worth it. I at least feel good going in that I know what I'm dealing with and that I'm not going to accept anything less than I deserve. I guess I just wanted to share.

be9ojc,Looking for men's statements,"I am doing a project for my college english class about men who have been physically abused in relationships, either romantic relationships or platonic/family relationships.  It ranges from violence to sexual assault. I know it is a very painful topic to talk about, and it is hard for many to come forward about it. In my project, I am trying to raise awareness for male victims,  and I talk about how few resources we have for these men.  I also go into detail about how gender roles affect their ability or willingness to come forward.  I am wondering if there are any men who wouldn't mind coming forward with their stories so that I could share them in my project.  I have ""interviewed"" a friend and one of my family members about this,  but I don't know anyone else. I hope this does not come across as insensitive, and I understand if nobody wants to share.  It is very personal and painful to talk about. I just thought I would try asking on reddit.

bepg81,How do you stop obsessing?,"When I left my abuser's house, I thought it was all over. I thought I was safe. But then the PTSD kicked in - flashbacks, memories etc. 

Then I started to recover, but I found myself obsessing - wondering what they were up to, wondering if I was really a victim or if I'd been the bad person and worse - I found myself checking their social media (I'd unblock them every now and again). I couldn't help myself, and whenever I saw them on holiday or having a good time, I'd just feel so much worse. I deactivated some of my accounts to stop myself from doing this. The worst part was all (and I mean ALL) of our mutual friends sided with them (the abuser). I was told by one of my closest friends at the time, that it was all my fault and that I had nearly destroyed their life. My abuser had twisted the story of what had happened between us. And everyone blindly sided with them, because I was the one who left and moved away and distanced myself. 

It's now been almost a year since I left them. I have rebuilt my life from scratch, and I'm incredibly proud of myself. I have been promoted at work, I've got a stable home environment, I'm planning my future and I've even started dating again. But I still can't stop obsessing. I can't stop seeing what they're up to, and feeling sad when I see them with my friends. When does this feeling stop? What can I do?

bewcal,I'm kinda in a similar situation as Gypsy Rose Blanchard...,"I don't know what to do. Have you seen the show on Hulu, The Act? I can relate to Gypsy to some extent. I'm 28 years old, with a new child, trapped here for all eternity by my grandma. Ever since she adopted me at 10 years old, she has made it her mission to diagnose everything that's wrong with me and use me to get people to feel sorry for her, as well as emotionally abuse me. I was molested when I was 5. So I had some anger issues when I was a kid. I was neglected by my mother. I had abandonment issues. She decided I had bipolar. Bought a book about it. Took me to a doctor and when they had me take the test for it she refused to let me take the test alone, she answered every question for me, when I would answer questions she would tell them I was lying and told them that I'm very manipulative. They tried several different medications on me. Trying to find the right one that worked. None of them ever did. They caused me to act out extremely, I hates it, I would sleep for days, binge eat, scream, cry, throw things, completely freak out. My grandma would accuse me of not taking my meds because of the behavior the meds were causing... So I started doing what she accused me of, I'd hide the medicine under my tongue, spit it out later. Then she started to say ""wow I can tell the meds are working you're acting so normal""... So then I made the mistake of telling her one day. We moved out of state. I was ""homeschooled"". She said that she didn't have to register to homeschool me. She bought me 3 books for 4th and 5th graders, I was supposed to be starting my first year of high school... When I was around 17, I finally told her that I wasn't taking the meds and that my good behavior was all me. She didn't believe me. She told me how I was the most bipolar person she'd ever met. She constantly told me what I could and could not handle ""out in the real world"". Anytime I did something good that made me feel confident, she would tear me down for it. If I try to stand up to her, I get sent to mental wards. She calls 911 says I threaten suicide or threaten to kill her. Since I was a kid, and have medical records saying that I am bipolar and have chronic depression, of course they believe her. The depression is at least an accurate diagnosis. I have to act how she wants me to act, so much in fact I have no idea what my real personality is like anymore. Sometimes I wonder if maybe she's right, maybe I am crazy. I think maybe having to go through all of this for so long has made me crazy. She tells people that I have mental problems, they are confused when they meet me because I seem so normal and very smart and capable. I've been told this. Alot. I have this weird constant need to seek her approval and I constantly have to ask her permission to do things. My friends? I don't have any left. Family? They're all in another state, but also totally fooled by her. I want to get away from her but I'm afraid to be without her. I don't want her to get into trouble for what she's done. My boyfriend was very physically abusive and emotionally abusive. He lived with us for a long time. They would gang up on me often. Now I have major anxiety problems, I'm very shy and afraid to talk to people. I tried opening up to my family. My aunt, believes me. She has went through the same thing with my grandma as me. All of my grandmas kids did. My aunt says my grandma is crazy. I told her because she stays away from our family as much as possible and I had a feeling it had to do with my grandma. I need help. I have a little boy now, yes, from the abusive ex boyfriend. I'm a fantastic mother but I am a single mother and trapped by her. I need to be able to work and drive. She won't help me get my license it's been an argument since I was 18 years old. And I don't know anyone where I live who can help me. What do I do? Please. I don't want my little boy growing up in this mess. My biggest fear is that my grandma will die and my baby and I will be on the streets.

bf2g9h,I feel guilty for wanting to escape,"In the past i always made excuses for my mothers behaviour towards me and my siblings, but now i can't take it anymore. She's yelled at me, hit me, called me retarded and a bitch (along with other things) and she says things to purposefully hurt my feelings, like telling me I'm fat or stupid and I'm selfish. I gave her all the money i was saving for college because we needed to pay the bills, but she said she's not going to give it back because it was for ""the family"" even though she promised to pay me every penny back. 

Every time i think of all the things she does to me, i start thinking its my fault. ""If i didn't do this or that, she wouldn't of..."" or that i deserve it. Maybe i do?.

I'm planning to move out but so far i have no money and my grades were shit in high school (2.8 gpa). I went through a rough time in my last semester of hs so i stopped doing homework because i thought ""why do anything at all if youre just gonna die"". Everyone in my family kept telling me I'm  just depressed because I'm graduating and its a big life change, and because of my age, and didn't try to understand that i had been dealing with it for years. So because of that i have no chances in any college. 

Every step i take in trying to get away makes me feel so much guilt. I keep thinking how sad she would be if i left, and how her oldest daughter abandoned her.

Because he doesn't really care about them either as much as I wish he would. But he would never let me have them because there goes his way of controlling me... so I stay. The fear of him taking them from me because he would to a court there's nothing wrong with him as a parent. He's hit me, held me down, stabbed me with a fork believe it or not.

bf8tj6,Mom,"I’m 19, I’m in college.

I’m gonna list thing my mom does weekly since I was 11 I’ve been too scared to do anything

Reminds me of things I already know about and then says I don’t know about it

2. Orders me to do only homework and sees me through it while making sure I “do it right “

3. When I make the Smallest mistake, say leave a cup on the table after dinner, chews and berates me about I don’t care, and you wake up wanting to hurt me emotionally

4. If she sees me look like I act like a child, she slaps me

5. Yells nearly Every weekend and sometimes 1-2 times a week, then says She doesn’t want this to happen and apologizes for yelling.

6 I also have a stringent dress code, low shirts have to have a camisole, no crop top except when wearing overalls and only in the summer, no bikinis, can’t modify my body in any way even temporary hair dye. Says no one likes someone who smells as bad or is as gross as you, after a week of not showering ( exaggeration)

7. Says I need to be independent then does my chores.

8. Means I won’t be able to live myself if I did move out

9. Makes me respond inhumanly fast and says that not responding will make people not want to talk to someone who responds so slow ( the wait usually a 3-10 seconds wait)

10. She looks at my texts and has passwords to Everything

11. When I protest ( like yesterday I said I feel like you don’t trust me), she gets mad and stays mad for days afterward. And berates me each day

Outside of this, we have an extremely close relationship.

I’m also a hippie, and she tries to slow my processes to care for the environment and says drugs will lead to jail; meanwhile, I take 8 pills every day for illnesses (hate that I take them, I believe in natural medicine). She also uses my medical issues to keep me close to home and depending on her. She also makes me take a shower ( I hate wasting water ) and shave ( I’m allergic to the metal in the razors) and do what she calls “being presentable” She also says this stuff to me to days ago I said to my mom ""I feel like you don't trust me "". Because she did homework with and for me, she then chews me out. And I say ""it's JUST my feeling not that I think."". she goes on and on about ""you don't care,"" and you always abuse me.""

things she says every single time she gets mad

"" why do you say such mean things.""

""you're a bitch""  ""stop saying things like that.""

"" I gave up everything so you can have everything.""

"" You think it's ALL fun and games. IT'S NOT.""

""I had to work while going to school, you don't have to.""

""I can't treat you like an adult when you say things like that ""

“ I’m paying for your college education you just have to pull in the effort “ “ I’m paying big money so you and your brothers can go to college.”

“ you do nothing around the house “

“ you can’t move out you need to take care of me “

“ you act like a baby you need to take responsibility ""

other things she constantly says

"" do you really want to \_\_\_\_\_ that ""(either its wear, watch, write in a harsh, mocking tone)

""OK MISS\_\_\_\_""(what ever minor mistake or ""bad"" quality , yesterday it was MISS impulsive""

(whenever we're late , usually in the car)"" being late will automatically get you fired if you have a job""

"" here she goes again leaving the door open and letting the bugs in "" ( whenever I ACCIDENTALLY leave the door open )

She won’t let me get a license. She won’t let me get my own credit card. She especially won’t let me move out.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

bfawk9,"Is this abuse, or just toxic but not abusive, or fine? Because I'm not sure","I have a complicated relationship with my mother. I haven't realised how problematic it is for me until sometime in the past year (I recently started attending a mental health school which is what kind of inspired this long bout of self-psychoanalysis).

Some of the time she can be gentle and calm and nice to talk to, but a lot of the time she's ignoring me, and every now and again she'll have these huge explosions.

Mostly she's too busy to talk to me, and either wants be to help her with housework and putting my siblings to bed. Then after they're in bed, she's too tired to deal with me. I'm not angry at her for this exactly, because she does do a lot of work.

Just the other night she had one of these explosions that I mentioned. I wanted to show her and Dad something, but they were too busy with my siblings, so I offered to help putting them to bed. I tried to get them into bed. They didn't listen for ages, so I went off to do something else and try again a few minutes later. Mum saw and told me to put them to bed very curtly. I could tell she was edgy, so I did try to do it quickly.

And then I got into some dumb argument with my sister while I was trying to put my brother into bed. That was what the explosion was about. My sister started yelling at me, and then my mum came in and started in on me as well. I can't remember exactly what she said, but it disturbed me and I went into full shutdown (I'm autistic and often when people, specifically Mum, raise their voice to me or insult me I freak out a bit, go nonverbal and curl up very small. It's an involuntary reaction and just as stressful to me as it is annoying to them.) That was when she got really angry and told me not to do that and said that she ""didn't buy it"" and implied that I was being melodramatic and faking my reaction. This further upset me, causing me to become less capable of speech and movement, and she started to yell at me, calling me ""domineering"" and ""manipulative"" (so essentially accusing me of being abusive, as those are the main characteristics of abuse as I understand it). She also said that I'd ruin the next day (we had a big outing the following day), and she's said similar stuff in the past, so that it's become a deep fear of mine (to sabotage and ruin things for other people without meaning to). So on and so forth. Eventually I was lying in a ball and crying. It seems pretty stupid when I write it but it was really upsetting at the time. I still couldn't move, and she seemed to be under the impression that I could move but wasn't just to irritate her. So then she started to physically move me out of the room. Only she couldn't, because she's not very fit and I'm a 14 year old who was on a bunk bed. She yelled at me a bit more and then tried to get my dad to lug me off the bed. They had a quiet conversation but I couldn't hear what they were saying because I was crying too much. Then they left and after a few minutes I was able to go to my room upstairs. I remained nonverbal for the rest of the night.

If this was an isolated incident it would be okay, but it's not. She frequently has outbursts in which she'll cry and throw stuff and blame my siblings and I for basically anything. She's hit me before- rarely, and not very hard (no bruises or anything), but enough that I'm always worried that she might when she's angry. There are other things, various fears, mentalities and complexes that I've unearthed that are primarily due to her emotional instability.

I feel like this might be toxic or abusive, but I honestly am not quite sure, and I'm worried that I might just be blowing it out of proportion- so many stories I've heard are so much worse.

I wish she was just nice all the time or mean all the time or even just ignored me all the time. It's so difficult to figure out what's going on with people when the chop and change all the time.

Please help me figure out what the fuck is going on.

TL;DR: My mum sometimes has fits of anger in which she'll accuse me of sabotaging my family's outings, being manipulative and melodramatic, and will act like my siblings and I are the cause of everything wrong in her life.

This is an update of what is going on, with proof. If you don't want to read the whole story. In short, I had to leave my abusive mother because I was scared for my life. She has been mentally and physically abusive and after calling me a psychopath and that I will never get better I snapped and wanted to die, especially after the post I wanted to commit suicide even more so after she said she would bash my head in if she saw my room and said that it wasn't a threat and she would not be sorry for it (*paraphrased).* Since I have left I have come to realize that in actuality that what I did was the right thing for my safety. I was scared for my life and I left this behind, so she can leave me alone because I don't want her to come after me, but as you can tell by this post it does not matter. This is what I left my mother before I left:

Then my mother messages me trying to manipulate me, even though in the past she has actually kicked me on in the cold and threatened it enough since I was 16, actually after thinking about it since I was 14. So, since I care, I messaged her friend to let her know I am safe, but my mother wants more! (*By the way I put it in order so you can understand it easier*):

THEN after this I get a message saying I stole from her when I ONLY TOOK MY SHIT, I did NOT take her suitcase, but my bookbag. I mean why the hell would I steal from her when I had to leave behind almost everything behind for her to sell in her benefit, PLUS my boyfriend makes enough to take care of both of us, so wtf?

I'm worried it will get worse but have nowhere to go other than to my nearly as bad mother. I called the police after the incident and they can't separate us. I have no money and no mode of transport to get to someone I trust more than my parents so I'm stuck like this fearing both of them.

What make this worse is I could of step in but being on some night quill I was half asleep and obvious to what was going on when he handed me their 10monthold. After dozing off with the baby laying on me in my recliner he took her. I ask is everything ok? He said no and slammed my door.  I got a call from my mom so I groaned and went and she told me why 'name' went outside. I'm like what? So didn't even bother to ask him, I went to get my shoes and ran outside to find her. After 20mins of looking for her I found her and brought her back. She was about to go upstairs, I told her no. After I was about to go upstairs to cuss him out but my mom said no. Respecting what she said I didn't and just waited. She knocked on his door and he was being rude to her and I corrected him to not say* what the hell you want* yell up and said don't speak to her that way. He got defensive and yell *I'll fuck you up* I told him bring his little trash Ass down. Then he started cussing saying he was gonna stab me. My mom told me to go outside so I did to cool off.
I know didn't make the situation any better but I was tried and angry.

bfldz1,Need some advice and help (if possible),"I’m the eldest in an asian family, with 2 younger siblings after me. Everything was going quite well till secondary school, whereby my mother lost her job due to a work accident and hurt her back. As a result, it led her to be jobless and my father being the only one working for the 5 of us. Since last year after I had graduated, I had noticed that my parents’ behaviour towards each other and particular to my brother and myself have gotten worse over the past few months. 
During my part time contract job i had gotten some money and did the best that I can to help my family when I got back home. Afterwards, I will just head to the laundry room( whereby my desktop setup was at) and either talk with my friends, or play some games. I did not continue my contract after the 6 months due to a lost of interest and to take care of my mother, to which my dad and her will keep on screaming at my ears almot everyday and asking me to find another job. The fact that she herself was going into her 50s and my dad told me that she is unable to control her anger and venting out her anger on me, is starting to get on my nerves. She claimed that everyone was caring about their own business but no one would listen to her. When we gave her the time to talk, she would refuse the chance to be heard and replied “I should be the one whom you listen to all the time, not simply a moment of time”. She keeps on using my father’s paycheck to manage the bills, and my father kept on screaming at me for simply staying at home and carrying for my mother. At this point, I am really about to lose it and go crazy. My 2 siblings can be taken care by my parents, but I am starting to wonder whether I can start to leave the house once I have a proper job. (Note: I am turning 21 so it is legal to move out, but I have a lack of money and waiting for a job interview so I’m stuck at this point in time.)

bfte65,Heavy burden.....,"A sweet poison that can kill you in an instant. Yes. That’s how he beats his enemies. It seems delusional but, that’s how I imagine it to be. After all, I was one of his victims. And now, I’m being forced to carry out his orders and keep it all a secret. A heavy burden that I couldn’t rely on anyone except myself. I might even carry it to my grave as it is my sin. A sin that I cannot keep anymore. I’m already at the end of my wits. I couldn’t keep up anymore. Even now, I’m shaking heavily and my chest is aching. My heart feels like it’s being stab many, many times with a very sharp needle that can pierce right through while injecting a poison each time. My earliest memory with it started with my stepfather kissing me multiple times while I was asleep. During that time, my mother was taking a shower and I was awake, pretending to sleep. Since I was still 11 or 12, I was still going through puberty. And so, whenever I see him, I used to keep looking at his lips and he would eventually catch me looking at him and jokes about me wanting a kiss from him. I don’t know if he knew that I was still conscious at that time but I believe he wouldn’t remember that now. After that incident, it kept getting worse. Whenever I get sick and gets send home by the school nurse, he would leave his work place and take me home with him. He started to touch my breasts whenever I was weak. Then, eventually, he started to fiddle around my body and tries to masturbate after making me cum. Now, 4 or 5 years of carrying this “job”, he managed to convince my mother to let him and me stay in one bedroom while she stays with my brothers. And to make it worse, he is 42 and I am 17 which is the same age as his daughter who is living with his ex wife. And now, everyday, he forces me to have sex with him. The only reason why I am keeping this a secret is because my family is struggling under a large amount of debt and I haven’t had the chance to meet my real father and so I’m keeping this shameful act to keep my family from falling a part knowing that he would rather save himself than others as he manipulated my naive and weak mother into bearing two kids and to let my half brothers have a father figure in the house.
I’m afraid of what will happen in the future.
I just want to die,

bftlsz,My stepfather keeps mentally forcing me to do his bidding but I don’t know what to do.,"A sweet poison that can kill you in an instant. Yes. That’s how he beats his enemies. It seems delusional but, that’s how I imagine it to be. After all, I was one of his victims. And now, I’m being forced to carry out his orders and keep it all a secret. A heavy burden that I couldn’t rely on anyone except myself. I might even carry it to my grave as it is my sin. A sin that I cannot keep anymore. I’m already at the end of my wits. I couldn’t keep up anymore. Even now, I’m shaking heavily and my chest is aching. My heart feels like it’s being stab many, many times with a very sharp needle that can pierce right through while injecting a poison each time. My earliest memory with it started with my stepfather kissing me multiple times while I was asleep. During that time, my mother was taking a shower and I was awake, pretending to sleep. Since I was still 11 or 12, I was still going through puberty. And so, whenever I see him, I used to keep looking at his lips and he would eventually catch me looking at him and jokes about me wanting a kiss from him. I don’t know if he knew that I was still conscious at that time but I believe he wouldn’t remember that now. After that incident, it kept getting worse. Whenever I get sick and gets send home by the school nurse, he would leave his work place and take me home with him. He started to touch my breasts whenever I was weak. Then, eventually, he started to fiddle around my body and tries to masturbate after making me cum. Now, 4 or 5 years of carrying this “job”, he managed to convince my mother to let him and me stay in one bedroom while she stays with my brothers. And to make it worse, he is 42 and I am 17 which is the same age as his daughter who is living with his ex wife. And now, everyday, he forces me to have sex with him. The only reason why I am keeping this a secret is because my family is struggling under a large amount of debt and I haven’t had the chance to meet my real father and so I’m keeping this shameful act to keep my family from falling a part knowing that he would rather save himself than others as he manipulated my naive and weak mother into bearing two kids and to let my half brothers have a father figure in the house.

I’m afraid of what will happen in the future.
I just want to die,

bfxnsd,I was beaten up in the middle of the road.,"I don't know if this is allowed here but this is a story about how 5 bullies beat me up in the middle of the road.

Backstory: I am autistic and very emotional. So I get upset easily. I have been bullied since year 2 up until I dropped out at the end of year 11. All this in Australia whiched I live. On with the story

So it started after school when I was on a bus talking to some friends. I was only 14 when this happened. I was talking to friends which were a seat behind. So I had to lean over the chair to talk to them. We were in the middle of the bus and at the back were some really bad kids. They were calling me names and stuff. They knew me for some reason. Maybe because from the years they bullied me. I was a easy target. One of them had a idea to throw a lighted match at me. At the time it was winter and I was eating a jacket that was from the school and was flammable. So one of the kids throwed the lighted match at me. Luckily, it burned out just before it touched me. 

At the next stop, I told the bus driver what happened and he said he will deal with them. He didn't. I wanted to get away from the bad kids so I got off the stop before mine to be safe. Bad choice. They followed me off the buss and after the bus left, they surrounded me. They told me I was a snitch and didn't realise for around 20 seconds. So I tried to run away and they grabbed me in the middle of the road. They start to kick, punch and spit at me. They called me names while doing it. It lasted for around a minute and they just ran away afterwards. They had siblings cause I saw them watched as I got beaten up. I was brused, bleading and I was crying like I had no air in my lungs. 

I lemp to the nearest shops cause I knew that a cop was always there cause their was a liquor store at these shops. I manage to get there and told the cop what happened. As a finished telling the cop what happened, a different set of friends whiched I hang with aswell came around the corner and they saw me in pain. I also told them what happened and they were shocked to see me like that. One of them knew my dad's number. So he called him and from what my dad told me (he had the day off), he dropped everything and came to me. He arrived minutes later and me and the friend who called him got into his car and tried to find them. We couldn't. 

The report I did went through and around a week later, I had to be called into a room at the police station where they interview criminals. I told them in detail and surprisely, my dad knew why they were cause he has to deal with them before. All the people who beat me up got changed with assault and they never bullied me again.

bg18wq,I just woke from a nightmare where my mother slapped me (24M),"I had a dream that ended with me suddenly getting slapped because I was late for school. At first I was just shocked and went to hug my wife. I told her what happened and I made a few remarks about the dream 

I had forgotten how her eyes went wide and her nostrils flared. How her posture changed slightly. As I was saying that I completely broke down. I didn't know what to do so I just started crying. My wife just held me and comforted me and that made me cry harder. 

I didn't realize I never got to feel safe as a kid. That I was always tiptoeing around trying to make sure I wouldn't get in trouble. My wife said that she had felt the same about her father. I started to say at least he wasn't physically abusive. Then I started crying even harder. 

Because I realized that while her father hadn't been physically abusive I had been. Unable to deal with my anger I lashed out. I never truly hit her. Never even bruised her. But I still forcibly grabbed her. Still towered over her physically.  I haven't had an episode like that in a year now. 

My wife is amazing and has given me a second chance. But my own mother has changed and become a better person and honestly that makes it worse. I wish I could just hate her. I wish I didn't have to love her.",XylonHurst,2019-04-22 04:59:50,2,258,6.43,14.76,79.62,7.72,10.75,14.73,94.57,61.63,25.19,20.93,15.5,0,0,5.43,0,4.26,3.88,9.3,10.08,8.91,7.36,3.88,25.19,5.04,3.49,1.94,0.78,0.78,7.75,3.1,4.65,0,1.55,1.55,11.63,3.1,0,7.36,1.16,13.95,2.33,3.88,1.55,0.78,2.71,2.71,4.26,0.39,1.55,1.94,2.33,0.78,1.16,0,0,7.36,2.33,1.55,1.16,1.55,1.16,14.34,6.59,1.16,12.4,1.94,3.88,6.59,0.39,0.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.4,8.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.71,0.78,0
bg1kjq,How does my mother (F52) get out of an abuse relationship with (M48)?,"Over the years my father has cheated, manipulated, and brainwashed my mother, this weekend she decided to end it but I feel in my heart she’s going to get back with him; and I’m upset.

Two weeks ago my fathers cousin Y came to stay with us because his wife made a punch at him in a fight and he got the law involved, with nowhere else to go Y had to come to us and my father took him in, since that time my father has been making up delusional stories about my mother and Y fooling around together and that my mother wants to get rid of him so she can be with Y, he specifically took this man in to ridicule my mother.

When we got home after a long trip where he complained all day, he kept everyone up at 4 in the morning roaring and bawling nasty things to my mother, rip roaring drunk might I add.
I went out and crawled in bed with her until he came out again.

(His physical and mental state)
•300 lbs
•Doctors said his heart could explode at any moment
•Does reckless things
•Smokes 2 packs a day
•Binge drinks
•Borderline diabetic
•Extreme narcissism and sociopathic tendencies
•A lot on his conscience

He was up telling my cousin that he hated her guts and that she was with Y, both my mother and Y haven’t even said boo to one another, I’ve spent way more time with Y than she has.

Yesterday we saw his ex wife’s number on his Siri search we also found an ex girlfriends number, and found that he calls his side chick a lot, I told my mother that I was tired of living this way and she’s decided she has too.

She went out with my father and told him that she is leaving him and they are over, the only reason he didn’t say anything is because he thinks she’s only joking. He thinks he can manipulate her, and she is allowing herself to.

Last night he hounded and hounded her to get back together with him, and when she declined he got upset and took it out on the dog.

We both got into my bed but last night at 3:00 he came in and got her for her to lie in their bed; I was pissed off when she said she went into her own bed, because that was something we agreed she needed to stop doing. She was blaming it on my bed and the heat and my crying, but I know the only thing in her mind.

She dreams of this happy life where we all live in harmony and everyone is good, but that hasn’t happened in 15 years and it never will. Last year she gave him a chance to stop his shit, and then two days later he was caught cheating again.

Sometimes I feel like beating the hell out of my mother because she’s so naive and stupid that I can’t help but get upset with everyone, she is abused everyday but somehow still trusts and crawls back to the abuser.
I understand that she has
•No family
•Barely any money
•There are no apartments available right now
•He’s constantly hounding her
And my being upset and depressed everyday doesn’t help her either, but it seems like every time she “leaves” she does the same shit over and over and nothing changes.

I told her if she goes back with him again I will never forgive her, and her constant lying to me. But I told her as well that if he cheats on her she deserves everything he gives to her and I will no longer be there to care about her shit, and if she speaks about it I’ll tell my father.

The easiest thing to do is give up now and get back with him, she’s been leaning towards the easiest option but I told her that he’s not going to win, and he’s not going to have everything in his favour, even though his cheating and then putting up a fight to leave is in his favour.

TL:DR; my mother has nobody to stay with, barely any money, no apartment opportunities the only thing she has is to stay in a house with an abuser.",altacc_109,2019-04-22 05:32:58,5,741,21.53,87.43,16.33,5.56,37.05,11.34,93.52,61.13,24.16,18.89,5.53,1.08,0,12.01,0.27,5.26,3.37,13.36,7.83,5.67,8.91,2.16,17.54,2.7,1.62,0.81,1.21,1.89,5.94,2.02,3.91,0.54,2.83,0.27,21.73,2.83,0.13,8.1,6.61,10.8,1.75,1.75,0.81,2.56,2.02,2.97,1.35,0.27,0.81,0.27,2.7,1.08,1.21,0,0.54,8.1,2.56,0.81,2.56,2.43,0.4,6.48,9.72,1.48,17.68,3.24,8.77,6.75,0.27,0.81,1.35,0.4,0.13,0,1.21,0.67,0.13,0,0.13,0,12.15,2.56,3.78,0.27,0.4,0.13,0,0,0.27,2.29,0.81,1.62

bg3bb1,Abuse or normal hormonal changes?,"I have inquired with a few people on this topic and don’t really know where to turn. I can’t be totally upfront with anybody because I’m afraid of what could happen if word got out. My pregnant girlfriend is extremely jealous and clingy. I have no free time away from her which honestly I could deal with if she didn’t get upset when I do things I enjoy. I enjoy playing music and haven’t touched it in months because she gets upset when my attention isn’t 100% on her. I feel like I betray her when I do anything other than what she needs me to do at the moment because I feel like she’s not herself. I wouldn’t know for sure because she became pregnant immediately after we got together. I’ve known her for years but it seems like she’s a different person than what she portrays to the public eye. We don’t have a perfect relationship and things moved entirely too quickly, obviously. But there have been a few instances where suicide is threatened when we argue. She has had to give up a lot and didn’t expect pregnancy. She was under the impression that she couldn’t have any more children so it took her by surprise. She does honestly seem depressed but only if we aren’t getting along. She accuses me of cheating on her on a daily basis when I would never do anything of the sorts, and if I want to hang out with a friend she makes me feel horrible. I have a second job on the weekends where I get to work alone. Before she would show up unannounced and claimed to be only checking up on me because she was worried. She constantly assumes that I lie about where I am and tells me to just leave her or “go ahead and talk to whoever” when I’m doing nothing wrong. If I don’t stay on the phone with her while I drive or have free time she claims that I don’t love her and can’t even talk to her on the phone. She has threatened the life of the baby and herself on several occasions, once she even hit her stomach during a very heated argument. I got rid of all the ammunition to her handgun. I don’t feel like I have any other option other than to put up with it for the time being. I worry about my son but I know when he’s born she would never act the way she has been. She gets very upset with me easily and I can’t lie I get upset as well. It is infuriating that I can’t say or do anything without her making assumptions and as many times as I’ve begged her not to assume and to just ask me about things she continues to do it. She has deleted contacts out of my phone, told me who I can and can’t talk to and just this morning I found out she’s blocked a few childhood friends from social media. She picks through my following/follower list and dictates how I should use my social media. I wouldn’t care to get rid of it to be honest and it’s not that big of a deal to me. But I don’t feel like I should have to just to make her happy and I don’t want that for us. Please somebody tell me if I’m honestly just overreacting or if pregnancy normally pushes people this far.

bg4gru,I live with my abusers.,"Hey reddit. I'm a 18F.

I don't really know where to start, but I've come here for some advice and support because I honestly have nowhere else to go right now.

Since I can remember my family has been explosive, so much so that in primary school I was self harming because of how poorly they made me feel. I went to counciling for bullying in like grade 2 and 3 and from what I recall my parents, especially mom, got angry with me because I ""told lies"" abiut them which made it seem like my issues were there fault. Only after that in 6th grade did I start harming after years of this type thing. They didn't take me to counselling until I was in grade 9, had tried to commit suicide multiple times, and my old school told them that if they didn't they'd report them for child neglect. When I was in school, they'd yell at me, swear at me, degrade me and even threatened to kick me out because I was apparently a big problem. 

My mental health has always been a problem that's only in my head, that I was causing. When I was briefly seeing a psychologyst in grade 9 she just gave me coping techniques for anxiety and depression, I didn't discuss my family with her because I was petrified of my parents accusing me of lying again. 

Physical health is also not a worry to them. I had cystic acne, I needed to get my boyfriends mom involved so that I could get treatment for it. I need braces and needed my wisdom teeth out 3 years ago. I only got my wisdom teeth removed two weeks ago, if they'd been removed sooner the doctors would have found a tumor in my jaw sooner, details for this are on one of my previous posts. Still haven't gotten braces and they've told me they will not pay for them ever. 

Recently I started university at my countrys top university, The University of Cape Town (its in South Africa) and was even lucky enough to get a partial scholarship because of my academic and extra curricular prospects. I still love at home. Because its in my city. As much as that was happy, my parents threw it in my face and asked me why I didn't get the full scholarship. My varsity fees are lower than my school fees were, but they're acting like I'm costing them their lives. Where I'm from uni is only 57000 Rands a year excluding my bursary, which is less than 5000 USD or Pounds, and in context my parents earn over 500000 rands a year, have company medical aid and even get 13th checks and bonuses. These fees are reduced to 37000 rands with my bursary which makes it under 3500 USD and even less in pounds.

Recently telling me to f* off out of their house has become a norm, telling me my grades aren't good enough is also common now. They fight with me over stupid things like not doing dishes straight after supper and escalate it to no extent.

I try spend as much time as possible away from home, but I'm beginning to find people are getting sick of helping me. My boyfriend of almost 3 years has started pressuring me to ""fix"" things and not always run away to his house. And I'm honestly gutted over that too. 

I went to a psychologist at the university. He said I have depressive and anxious symptoms because of my abusive parents. Called them abusive in a letter I needed to apply for financial aid so I can actually remove myself and even said I need further counsel to unpack my entire childhood. The abuse is mostly emotional, but he was shocked at how often I was hit as a child.

Something that's happening now is I've had a tumor removed, I'm still waiting for the results. I'm obviously scared. My jaw is also feeling weird. I went to my parents looking for emotional support and to ask if my mouths normal because it feels funny today and was cussed out, told to shut the f* up and to go to my room when I started crying. This complicates things because I'm obviously reliant on them for my medical things because I'm on their medical aid. It also illustrates how callous they are to me.

My younger sister, has also got on and started mirroring how my parents treat me. She doesn't face the same abuse from them.

Obviously there is more that's happened. I just don't know where to start with my spotted life. And where this abuse really started either. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can cope living with them? I'm tired of crying every day but my application for financial aid from my university hasn't even been processed, I'm also probably unlikely to get it because of my parents financial status. I can't stay with my boyfriend or friends because I've become a burden to everyone. I also have no idea if there are organisations in my country which would provide funding for my tertiary education and living if I do leave, because everything is complicated by the fact that I can be supported but my supporters are emotionally abusive and often neglectful and would not support me if I left their house.",catsandnip789,2019-04-22 09:58:55,0,908,20.06,16.35,92.98,2.79,19.32,17.51,92.29,58.7,20.59,16.19,12.89,0,0,0.66,2.64,4.41,2.64,13.44,10.57,6.61,8.92,2.09,19.49,5.07,2.97,1.98,1.43,1.43,6.28,1.87,4.41,0.77,1.54,0.77,9.03,1.43,0.44,0.66,0.66,12.89,1.87,2.86,1.87,2.53,1.54,3.85,0.88,0.22,0.33,0.33,3.3,0.88,2.09,0,0.22,5.84,1.76,0.55,1.76,1.76,0.44,6.94,11.45,0.44,13.77,1.65,6.5,5.73,3.74,0.33,0.88,1.76,0,0.11,0.22,0,0.11,0,0,0,12.78,5.07,3.08,0,0,0.11,0,0,0.44,3.63,0.22,0.22

bg7nk7,Ex abusive BF (26m) will be at same event as me,"Hi,

I have no idea what to do. I got out of an abusive relationship (physically and emotionally) in January. I am lucky that I was able to cope pretty easily (while I'm not confronted with him) and got to start over with a clean slate.

But yesterday I found out that one of my friends (who knows that my ex hit me and called me awful names the entire relationship) invited my ex to an event. This event goes from 1 pm until 9 pm and I've been looking forward to it for an entire year.

I've invited plenty of friends, family and even a date to go with me.
Now that my ex will be going as well I don't know what to do. I feel scared, angry, on the verge of crying my eyes out and I can't sleep.
On top of that the guy that I'm bringing as a date knows about my ex his behaviour. I had to explain because I'm so afraid to commit to someone right now. But he's the nicest guy that I've ever met and very understanding. So we decided to take it very slow and see where things will go.

I can't deal with the stress of him being there together with my ex. Plus I get physically ill whenever I even think about my ex. I start to shiver, want to puke,... 

So I really don't know what to do. To top it off, the event is a beer tasting festival. So alcohol will be consumed and we all know people can get a bit more emotional when they drink.

What should I do? I've been thinking about texting my ex and begging him not to come. To do me a solid. But I know he'll just use that later against me. 

I'm at a total loss.

Tl;Dr: my abusive ex will be at the same event next week as me because a friend of mine invited him. I will have to see him at least 6 hours straight while being there with my date. I feel physically sick even thinking about it and can't sleep. What should I do?",Yellowsound,2019-04-22 14:27:48,2,373,30.35,29.58,94.93,4.27,13.32,10.72,95.44,60.59,20.64,15.01,12.33,0.54,0,1.88,0.27,5.63,4.83,15.01,10.72,6.43,8.04,2.14,21.45,6.17,3.22,2.41,1.07,2.14,5.36,1.61,3.75,0.8,1.34,0.54,11.26,0.27,2.41,0,2.95,10.99,4.29,0.8,0.8,0.8,1.61,2.68,1.88,1.07,0,0.54,3.75,0.8,2.14,0,1.07,7.24,3.49,1.07,1.34,1.88,0.27,2.95,14.75,2.14,14.21,2.41,5.36,7.24,0,1.34,0.27,0.27,0,0,2.95,0,0.27,0,0.27,0,16.35,7.24,1.88,0.27,0.27,0.54,0,0,0,4.02,2.14,0
bg7q9b,He (30M) has started shouting that I (23F) am abusing or kidnapping him whenever I tell him he is treating me improperly.,"I need to vent about this.

It started a week ago when he had a complete psychotic breakdown and was scratching layers of his skin off while threatening to kill himself and me. I talked him into going to the hospital only for him to start swerving us into oncoming traffic and shouting repeatedly that he didn't want to go and I was forcing him. 

I calmly told him to pull over and asked him if I could drive us there instead and he said yes...only to then roll down the window and scream non stop at the top of his lungs that I was kidnapping him.

We made it to the hospital where he then told me if we went in he'd tell the police at the entrance that I was kidnapping him and abusing him and he'd call my mom and dad who have heart conditions and tell them everything that is going on.

So I caved and brought him home.

Now ever since, every time that fucking asshole verbally abuses me and I stand up to him he starts shouting for help at the top of his lungs, saying he's being attacked, kidnapped, or abused.

bga5t4,Getting over my trauma,"I'm a survivor of many abusive, and toxic relationships, and I'm currently 4 months into dating someone that is a healthy human being who doesn't have an abusive or harmful bone in his body. 

I've been having a lot of issues reliving my trauma lately through minor MDMR therapy and minor hypnotherapy. I'm constantly questioning every move I make, everything I say, everything I feel, because I place this man that I truly adore in a similar category as my exes, and he has done nothing to deserve it in any way. 

My previous relationships involved rape on multiple occasions, using suffocation as a form of punishment for not listening or for questioning my S/O, cheating on so many occasions I lost count, and many many instances of extreme physical abuse, where on more than one occasion, I ended up hospitalized. 

I currently go to therapy to cope with my previous trauma as well as to deal with my anxiety issues and I am actively working on myself and dealing with the things that I've been through. 

Recently, one of my ex boyfriends, who nearly killed me on at least 3 occasions ran into me at my job, and refused to leave. He wanted to start a conversation and I repeatedly asked him to leave the store that I was working at because I was shaking, insanely, and on the verge of a full on breakdown. Since then, I've been having intensive night terrors, questioning every single thing my current S/O does, more than I normally do with my general anxiety, and have been so insanely insecure in every possible way because of the previous infidelity in my relationships. I know this isn't fair to my current S/O, and he's been so extremely supportive and understanding. 

Now I have constant fear that while I work on my trauma processing through therapy, he's going to get sick of dealing with the baggage that I carry, and he's going to leave. I'm terrified because I've literally fallen for this man so quickly, and that he deserves so much better, yet, he continues to want me. 

If anyone has any advice on coping with these histories, and being able to be fully open with your partner about the trauma you've been through, it would be deeply appreciated. 

I know I'll get a response about remaining single until I cope with it on my own, however, the person that I'm with is incredible, and again, I've fallen for him, deeply. He's shown tremendous support and has on more than one occasion reassured me that he will be here through every step of this process. 

I just genuinely worry about fully opening up about the things I've experienced, about how far the abuse went, about being sexually abused by a cousins friend when I was a young child, and him looking at me differently. I'm an extremely independent person 99% of the time, and leaning on him, my friends, or anyone is really hard for me to do. Plus he cares deeply for me, and I don't want him to get worked up over hearing about the people from my past and what they've done to me. 

I don't know if I should write it out, and allow him to read my history on his own time, or if I should just let it go and just use my therapist as a venting space and leave my current S/O out of it, but holding everything in is not doing it for me. It's causing so many problems in myself and I know eventually it cause issues in my current relationship. I just need some advice if anyone has any to spare.",mcskippypants,2019-04-22 18:18:56,0,624,34.31,28.2,89.01,3.84,29.71,19.87,93.43,59.78,20.67,14.9,11.54,0,0.32,2.88,0.16,5.77,3.85,16.51,10.26,5.77,9.13,1.12,17.79,4.97,2.4,0.96,1.28,3.69,6.09,1.92,4.17,1.28,1.44,0.16,9.46,0.16,0.64,0,3.37,12.02,1.92,2.24,2.08,3.53,1.76,2.88,1.12,0.16,0.48,0.32,1.92,0.32,1.28,0.32,0,6.25,1.76,1.44,2.08,0.96,0.16,4.17,12.18,0.96,16.99,2.56,7.85,6.73,1.12,0,0,0.16,0,0.16,0.96,0,0.64,0,0.16,0,14.74,3.21,6.89,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.85,0,0.8
bgbos8,Are my parents abusive or toxic?,"Idk, my parents spanked me as a child, but they don't do it any more. It never really helped it only made be want to spite them but since I was a child I was powerless.  
My mother didn't give us much attention since she was busy on the computer even when she didn't have a job. I will never forget the times she commented at my weight which was an insecurity during my entire life. She sometimes did it even when I was intentionally but secretly skipping meals. When I was diagnosed with pcos the first thing she cared about is difficulty loosing weight. She now is separated from my dad and I can't help but feel that she treats me better because she doesn't see me as often. My dad doesn't care that some of the things he does gives me a lot of stress such as loud pounding noises because the world won't accommodate that.

  
I'm 19 and in college. I'm dependent on my parents to help pay for education. I have had mental brake-downs after my first job and I had to quit because I was terrified of falling behind in school. I felt so much guilt from my dad calling me lazy for not having a job. I tried to get another job locally when I had less classes but I failed to get hired. I don't know if I should be proud to be an A student or to feel shame for not challenging myself enough. I've felt depressed because I changed my major from a business major to a integrated studies major because I wanted to be a graphic designer. I felt ashamed that I didn't pick a career path that seemed secure in his eyes. I don't know how to be an adult because I was never taught, but I'm expected to know how to do everything. I also feel like I don't have it hard enough to feel depressed. I don't work hard enough. I'm just an entitled child/adult whatever is more convenient. 

I have a habit of going to my room and not coming out because I don't trust people who aren't my closest friends. My parents often reinforce this. They can flip flop between being caring and being like I've described. My mom is usually caring but sometimes she can have the same mindset as my dad. They sometimes make fun of me for being in my room so often. Other times they tell me I should just be in my room for the rest of the day if they're busy or if my brother is insufferable.

  
I'm also bisexual and I no longer believe in god. But, neither parent knows this. I'm too dependent on them to tell them. My dad worships god and his very homophobic. He sometimes shames me from doing something for being ungodly. My mom has crazy beliefs that I don't understand but she also tries to brainwash me into.",KGM134,2019-04-22 20:50:48,3,504,10.01,10.58,89.03,12.59,15.27,15.08,94.05,62.7,22.42,18.06,13.69,0.2,0,2.78,1.39,4.37,4.56,11.51,13.29,5.75,8.73,4.76,20.83,4.56,2.98,1.79,0.6,1.98,5.36,2.18,3.17,1.39,0.4,0.6,11.11,2.78,0.2,2.58,1.98,16.27,3.37,3.17,1.59,3.77,0.99,5.36,3.17,0.6,0.4,2.18,1.59,0.4,0.6,0,0.6,8.53,1.98,2.38,3.97,0.6,0.79,5.36,13.69,0.99,10.32,0.79,4.17,5.36,4.37,0.2,0.6,0.4,0.79,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,0.2,12.5,6.35,0.79,0,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,4.76,0,0.2

Hell broke loose the day I turned 13 however. I tried to hide the physical abuse that was going on at home but I just could not do it anymore. My mom was ill most of my life with seizures and I felt that I was all alone because of that. My father used to call me by my name and I would playfully run away and he would chase me, not on this day. My dad weighed 350 pounds at the time. I was told later on when the abuse came to light that I should have just hit my father. Why the heck would I do that?! He would've killed me!! I went into my mom's room and she was watching tv. I asked her if I could sit with her and watch tv too. She said yes of course, and my dad came into the room and demanded that I get out of ""his chair."" I said no, mom said I could sit here and watch tv. He grabbed me by the arm and threw me across the room. I got carpal tunnel from landing against the wall on my left wrist (I am left-handed) and cannot take notes well to this day.

bgeeih,Does Fat-Shaming Count as Verbal Abuse?,"I am a fourteen year old girl, and my mum has constantly made me feel insecure about my weight, for about a year or so.  

I used to be a couple kilograms overweight, but I began to exercise more and soon lost those extra kilos, and am now a healthy weight. 

Despite this, my mum kept (and keeps) making remarks about my body, telling me I should stop whenever I eat *anything,* saying general things about being fat and needing to lose weight, and somehow links everything back to weight. I now can't eat anything without feeling guilty, exercise, not for the real health benefits, but to avoid gaining weight, and always  check myself in a mirror to see that I don't look fat. 

The thing is, I know I'm not fat, and there are moments when I'm really happy about my body, but all it takes is one comment from my mum for everything to come crashing back down. At first, I though that she was just concerned about my health, but the way she talks to me is not helpful at all. She chooses to say everything in a way that hurts, and she's made weight my biggest insecurity.

bgf2uf,"Don’t know if it belongs here, but I think my brother is abusive","So, I m 25 years old and male. I m a slightly bit chubby but working on it to get rid of my fat. I also have severe depression but I am in therapy.

I feel like my brother is constantly abusing me. 
I work in my dads company(or would if I could but currently incapable of working, due to my situation) my brother is supervising me, and whenever I make a slight mistake he starts screaming at me and shaming me both in the company chat and the family chat. 

He once even threatened to kill me because I wasn’t working fast enough, even though I was working as fast as possible while he was putting a massive amount of stress on me, thus damaging my concentration. 
My mum and my boyfriend witnessed it live, but nothing happened. He still is in a position of power over me at work, and I can’t quit cause I have nowhere else to work. Due to my depression I wasn’t able to finish or succeed in university. 

He beats me regularly if I do something he doesn’t like or so. I tell my parents but nothing happens. He continues to beat me. I hate him. 
He always says it’s my fault he beats me. 
If I would just not be myself maybe he wouldn’t think beating me is ok?

When we eat as a family and I want some more of moms delicious food. (Mostly the healthy stuff) he starts telling me if I want to get even fatter, and I shouldn’t be so greedy. Even though everyone else gets some more and he actually eats the most of all of us. 

If I could I would love to go annorexic to loose weight fast, but if I did, my boyfriend would get me to a hospital immedeately. 

Without my therapy I definitely would have taken my life already.

bghwd2,I don't know what to do.,"I posted here a couple days. I'm considering stopping living with my mom and only living with my dad because her emotional abuse. But the problem is, she's suicidal and I'm worried if I leave that'll be the last straw.

 What she has done lately is she almost killed herself then blamed me, constantly searches through my phone and texts, goes through all my bags looking for ""secret phones"", calls me a jerk constantly and makes me feel like a terrible daughter, threatens to send me to a mental ward, and sent me to a terrible and manipulative therapist with horrible reviews who malpractices frequently and makes me feel awful and is more defensive of her than me. Luckily my dad said he'll find me a new therapist. This morning she said that because of my autism she doesn't think I feel emotions like a normal person (probably wanting to compare me to my physically abusive, sociopathic brother). I really don't want to live with her but I also don't want her to hurt herself and it be my fault, I can't live with a suicide on my conscious. The abuse isn't even really that bad and I don't know if it even is abuse but whenever I'm living with her I feel lethargic and emotionally exhausted and unhappy all the time and I can't take it, I don't know what to do",ninjasnak3,2019-04-23 08:44:44,0,239,13.48,16.79,60.49,1,26.56,18.83,96.23,60.67,23.01,18.41,13.39,0,0,5.02,0,4.6,5.02,10.04,9.21,5.86,9.62,3.77,22.18,5.86,2.09,2.09,0,1.67,9.62,0.42,8.79,1.26,3.35,0.84,12.13,2.09,0,5.86,1.67,15.48,5.02,2.09,2.51,2.09,0.84,4.6,4.6,0.84,1.67,2.09,3.77,0,3.77,0,0,3.35,0.42,0,0.84,0.42,2.09,2.09,17.57,1.26,7.11,1.67,0.42,5.02,0.42,0,0,0,0,1.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.06,3.35,3.77,0,0,0,0,0,0.84,6.28,0.84,0
bgiiw8,That Was Not Expected [some NSFW],"My partner and I have a poly relationship and I recently started to date since meeting my partner and marrying them. So I met an individual online. We hit it off, and seemed to have many things in common. I asked them to my place on Saturday since we were having a party with friends, and they said they would come out. Throughout the week they would ask me to come and see them at their place and I kept telling them that I was busy this week due to the party and friends coming out and all that. They said they understood but repeat asking is a bit odd.

So Saturday comes around, and they show up at our house. My partner tried talking with them, but they ignored my partner basically and would rather talk to anyone than my partner. My partner even sat next to them and tried to get them to talk. And this individual would just look at their phone (I found this out later since I was in the restroom and collecting some things).

A little bit later on, it was just this person and me. We started to kiss, okay that’s fine. They start to rub my leg. Okay that’s fine I don’t mind. I choke them some (we have previously discussed this as something they like), and they seem okay with it. Then this person took their hand on my leg and decided to go straight for my genitalia.

Now a little bit about me: I am someone that does not do this. I am not a kiss on the first date person. I usually won’t romantically hold your hand until the 2nd-3rd date depending on the person and am very hesitant to be sexual with anyone unless I really know them. So this is very uncomfortable for me to have my genitalia touched on the first time meeting someone. I continue to kiss them a little bit while they are groping my genitalia then I stop and put my hands up and asked to calm down and let’s take a minute. After we stopped, and I tried to talk to them but they were more interested in making out with me. Again, they tried to grope me and, again, I said to calm down and let’s take a breather.

At this point, after all that, my partner walks in and grabs some things. I try to start a conversation with them and this person, and the only one who does not want to talk is the person I invited over. My partner is visibly upset, and this person I asked to come hang out with us is acting like nothing is wrong. I am just perplexed and getting overwhelmed by the whole thing so I go talk to my partner. They are not having a good time and this person I invited is being rude to my partner. After my partner lists their grievances, I tell them I’ll ask this person to leave because I’m not feeling comfortable with them either.

I asked this person to leave because my partner is not feeling well so I need to take care of them. So they leave and ask if they’d see me again on Tuesday (we made plans for that time) and I said “maybe.” They send me a message saying “sorry if I did something wrong.”

I sat on it, and the next night I sent them a message saying the more I thought about last night the more it made me uncomfortable and that I don’t think I can be in any kind of relationship with them and that I apologize that things didn’t work out. They said it was okay and hopefully we can still be friends. Then the next day they see me on the dating site we met and they send me a message saying that I can’t even handle casual sexual encounters and how embarrassed and humiliated they are and they didn’t realize that this would make them feel like a wreck.

Since the encounter, I have been noticing things changing about me (a very interesting feat for someone with cPTSD). I have conflicting emotions. I constantly feel dirty and am getting slowly more paranoid about things like dirt and dust around me. I am almost crying over blogs that have no relation at all to my situation. I keep having moments where I am dazed and confused and then I come back to reality for a bit. I keep blaming myself. I feel the urge to be sexual, and yet I don’t have a sex drive right now. My sex drive has been nonexistent since this incident, and usually I still have some kind of sexual desire even when I’m not in the mood. I am subscribed to quite a few porn subreddits and they do nothing for me. It’s like I know I find that attractive and sexual, just I don’t feel the emotions associated with it. I had sex with my partner the next night after the event happened, and I kept having issues because my head was just not in it. Since the person sent me that vitriol of a message I have blocked them from contacting me.

It’s all still really fresh for me. I also feel like a big baby because, as the classic mantra goes “someone has it worse off than you,” and I already delegitimize my issues enough as is, so my initial reaction is to bury this and repress, but I can’t seem to get it to bury and it’s just causing pain and conflict in my head and that alone is driving me insane because compared to other atrocities it’s a speck, yet it feels like someone just beat me up nonchalantly.

I’m writing this not for advice or for sympathy. I also intentionally left out gender specifics because to me, this feels like a form of sexual abuse, and abuse should be seen as something that is not gendered. I hope it lets people know that it doesn’t matter your gender, abuse is abuse, and that you’re worth more than your gender and you deserve to be happy, no matter what society tells you. There we go, happy message.

bgiuab,"My mother is homophobic to me. Is this a form of abuse? Whether it is or not, what can I do about it?","Title says it all, I guess. I'm 17(f), my mum found out I was gay by going on my phone a year ago and found out I was dating my same-sex friend. Every day I regret leaving it at home that morning instead of taking it to school with me.

The first few months were very bad, she would sit in her room and cry, I felt terrible for upsetting her, even though there is nothing wrong with being gay. She also lost all trust with me for hiding such a thing from her. I thought it would get better, but I think as time has gone by it has only gotten worse.

So... what has she done? It's hard for me to remember, it's been going on for over a year now. 

She told me it was just a phase, of course. Though not politely, there was a lot of very rude, homophobic things said. She believes that gay people, especially lesbians, are predators (I think she had a very bad experience with a pedophile female sports coach as a teenager). One time I accidentally walked in on her getting changed, she implied I was trying to see her naked, presumably because all gay people are sinful incestuous heathens in her mind.

Every time something reminds her that I am gay she has a disgusted look on her face, incredibly disgusted. When she remembers what I am, she talks to me as if I sicken her. Where she used to be indifferent to gay people on TV, now she becomes incredibly angry when she sees them. She looked me in the eye and told me that bisexuals (what I am) are the worst of all, because they have a choice to be straight and do not take it. ""They are the worst sinners of all. They are disgusting,"" she said, glaring at me. She's a very religious christian.

My phone needed a new password, an important date. The only important date I have is the day I started dating my friend (who I am only allowed to see very very rarely, and only in a group of multiple people). I stupidly made that my password. She immediately recognised it and was very angry, and had that disgusted face again. She immediately punished me for something else very minor (borrowing a coat from her that she gave me permission to borrow, she told me I was now banned from wearing it and took it back).


My hairdresser accidentally cut my hair too short (I asked for collar bone length, she cut too much off one side and had to do a chin length/mid-neck bob- it's a shitty salon). She was furious and upset, saying I look like an ugly dyke, saying I cannot go there again because they want me to look like a lesbian.

Sometimes she is angrily in denial ""You have too many male friends to be a lesbian. You must secretly like them."" Or she is trying to set me up with a boy- e.g. ""Oh, that male friend of yours, you should date him!"" ""Which boy would you date, this or this?"" ""You should go on a date with my friend's son"". 

I never bring up anything remotely to do with gay stuff around her. I never give her a reason to say this, I am constantly walking on eggshells, and sometimes she forgets all about the gay matter. Then she acts like a lovely, amazing mother, buying me surprise gifts etc. 50% of the time she is a great, loving mother. But I am afraid of her the other 50%. 

She has forbidden me from telling anyone I am gay. She is adamant that no-one, especially her friends can ever find out. This is incredibly important to her. Those of my friends who I have secretly told or have figured out, I have sworn to secrecy. 

My dad is very accepting of gay people. He is incredibly smart, a genius with genuinely an IQ of something well over 130, possibly 150 I can't remember what, but it's very high. He's logical and knows there is nothing wrong with being gay and it's not necessarily a disgusting sex act, unlike my mother (she cannot separate the concepts of gayness and sex, eg. two men holding hands ""it's disgusting to broadcast in public what you do in the bedroom""). But he has autism and is a big pushover, he lets this happen. It's not his fault, I don't think he realises how much my mum's treatment of me upsets me, or the extent of it. I love him to pieces and I don;t blame him for allowing anything to happen.

I know it doesn't sound like much, but every day she makes a little comment about gay people, every day I see her disgust at me. To have my own mother disgusted by me, it drives me to tears when I lie in bed at night.

I don't know what I should do. This is eating away at me.",AndJellyfish,2019-04-23 10:02:25,2,871,26.24,61.31,33.74,1.89,16.13,13.43,92.77,60.39,23.65,16.88,8.84,0.11,0.8,6.43,0.69,6.77,4.94,12.17,10.33,6.2,4.94,1.84,18.6,4.94,1.49,1.84,1.15,2.18,6.31,1.72,4.59,0.46,1.15,0.46,15.84,1.03,1.26,6.66,1.84,11.83,2.76,1.38,1.26,2.18,2.18,3.1,2.53,1.03,1.03,0.34,3.67,1.03,0,2.41,0.23,5.97,1.38,0.57,2.07,0.92,1.15,4.59,12.28,0.34,11.48,1.26,5.4,4.94,0.23,0.34,0.46,0.34,0.34,0,0.34,0.11,0,0,0.23,0,18.25,6.2,5.63,0,0.11,0.46,0.11,0.57,1.38,1.84,1.61,0.34

bgri0p,Vent for support and to honestly get it all off of my chest. [Long Post],"I(21F) grew up in an extremely abusive household, but no one would guess it because they never saw that side of my family. I was taught to cover my issues so well that  everyone I meet would never guess I was so horribly abused, and sometimes when I finally trust someone enough to open up about it, they are shocked and I honestly don't think they really believe me.

 I decided to finally say everything I feel I have needed to open up about and I hope it helps someone realize that they are not alone and that it does get better if you take the big scary steps OUT. 


My Mother was physically abusive and my father was an alcoholic. My mother had grown up in a horribly abusive household with three brothers. She was tough. She also knew how to fight. 

My father worked away from home in the oilfield, and when he did have time off he partied and cheated and gambled. My dad was very absent. Even the times he was home were spent in the arms of his recliner, watching Nascar and nursing his hangover. The good memories I do have of my father growing up were of bonfires out in our yard, listening to old rock music and talking to him. He would actually talk to us when he was drunk, and we didn't understand that he didn't remember anything until years later. 

My mother and father were extremely abusive to each other until I was around four. We would hear them screaming and beating each other up in the kitchen late at night from our bedroom in the tiny trailer house we lived in. The walls were thin and I remember the screaming vividly. 

The abuse for us kids started so young I don't remember it starting. I was extremely young. Maybe Three? I'm not sure. It started with what she called ""spankings"". She would scream at us for whatever we had done to displease her and then grab us and proceed to give us all spankings. She would hit you until her hand hurt and then get mad at you for that, and then grab the next kid. She started using wooden spoons. I don't remember how old I was I just remember them breaking on my bare bottom and her getting mad at me for breaking her spoons. Making me grab another. Breaking the next one.  

My mother got mad every day. It was an every day occurence until my sister ran away from home at 16 for us to get beaten. She would call us all in to the kitchen, make us stand side by side and then start by asking us questions we weren't actually allowed to answer.

 If we tried she would start screaming in our face. If we didn't answer she would scream in our face. The only thing we could say was ""I'm sorry"" and even that enraged her. When she had finally worked herself into a rage she would start grabbing us. I had waist length hair and she would grab it and shake me around by my hair. She would smash me into the cupboards and rip patches of it out. We weren't allowed to run away. We weren't allowed to complain. Anything but standing was warrant for more abuse. I vividly remember one time where she had shaken me around the kitchen by my hair and smashed me off of the oven multiple times. I had blood and snot pouring out of my nose and she had finally let go of me. That meant I was to stand to the side. She wasn't done, she was now going after a different sibling and if I dared run I'd get tenfold what I'd already received. She turned around and saw the blood and snot on my face and started choking me and screaming in my face about how f***ing stupid I am how stupid I must be to stand there with f***ing snot on my face. 

The abuse got worse until I was almost 7. My sister ran away from home to her best friend's house at the age of 16 and finally told her mom about the abuse, and showed her the bruises all over her body from the night before's beating. My sister's mom's friend called CPS. CPS had my sister move in with my auntie. 

I remember my mother showing up to my aunties house and screaming in her face about how she dared take her daughter from her while we sat in the back of the truck.

 After that came a summer of swimming lessons and child counseling, where we were brought in every week to a room free of our mother and counseled by a nice women with toys who was trying to ask us questions in just the right way to see if we had been abused. 

The first session was very blunt. I remember my mother telling me before hand that I would be in a room with a stranger and that they were going to ask if mommy hit us, and that I was to say no or we wouldn't get to see mommy any more. I remember the lady asking me if my mom ever spanked me. If she used something other than her hand. If she ever spanked me lots. If I ever felt like I didn't deserve the spanking. I remember answering that sometimes she spanked us. Only a couple taps. Never hard. I always thought I deserved it. 

My little brother had answered differently though, he told them she did hit us. For whatever reason they didn't remove us from her custody that day. Instead came random CPS visits and three months of one on one counseling. I remember how my mother beat choked my little brother and screamed at him after that. He was five.

My mother was forced to go to anger management courses for a couple years and take meds. They helped for a few years and I remember feeling happier during that time period. Things were still horrible, but they weren't as far gone as before, and I didn't know better. I thought getting hit once a week was better. 

My mother homeschooled me from grade three up and moved us all an hour out of town when I was 11. The abuse started getting worse again after that point. It involved more manipulation and control of where we were allowed to go or who we were allowed to see than previous though. She had one daughter escape because she had friends. She made sure I didn't have any connections outside of the house that weren't fully monitored by her constantly. When I finally did get a phone she would change my passwords, go through all of my conversations and get mad no matter what. Deleting the majority of my friends list was a weekly occurence. 

Highschool was hell. Age 15 came and I begged my parents to let me go to regular school. In my mind if I could only get out for a few days I could find someone to stay with. Someone safe to talk to. I could run away. My mother forbid it and my father never fought it. It was around this age I finally got up the courage to tell my dad about what was going on at home. However each time I did, he wouldn't go a rant about how he had no where to go, and the next morning he'd act completely normal again. That's when I learned he was so drunk he didn't remember anything I'd said. I stopped telling him after that. 

By age 15 my mother was so depressed she stayed in bed most of the time. My job was to get the chores done, feed the farm animals, help my little brother with his schooling, wake my mother up, cook lunch, complete my own schooling, and cook supper. I had no social life and one friend only through text. 

Age 16 I became extremely resentful of my mother. I became sneaky and angry. I made some friends at a bible study group my mother allowed to go to at the neighbor's house and started sneaking out see my best friend late at night. I had my mom's schedule down pat and was so good about detail she didn't catch me for over a year. During the day I would do everything she wanted, take the beatings and then sneak out late at night and meet up with my best friend, who would just drive me around and let me cry if I needed to, or scream, or take me to bonfires to feel slightly normal for a couple hours before I had to go home again. My grades subsequently dropped from my straight A average that year, and I remember getting the shit kicked out of me for it and not caring at all. I remember screaming back for the first time. I remember her crying. I remember feeling terrible and angry all at once. 

My 17th birthday was terrible. Someone shot my horse three days before, standing in our field and that broke me. My birthday came and went and my parents fought. I caught my dad cheating on my mother and she made me show her the details. She then decided to tell me in that moment that my father was also a cross dresser. It was a HUGE mind-f***. 

I left home a week after all of that happened and moved into town with my auntie, the same one who had helped my sister years before. I started my first real job a day later and went through an extremely drunk and angry year of hating my life and everything I had been dealt. I dated a couple losers that broke my heart. It was horrible. However I slowly got my shit together and the feeling of being my own person and making my own opinions was amazing. I got my own place and bought a dog! I was super proud of myself. 

I got into a toxic relationship right after that and found out I was pregnant. I stayed for far too long until I finally realized I had fallen back in to a vicious cycle of abuse I would never break unless I left. I left and took by this point my two very young children with me. 

I worked three jobs for a year. I built my own business. I made some really amazing friends. I met an absolutely amazing man:) I fell in love with actually living and being  myself. 
 
Life has honestly been hell for so many years. I am so extremely grateful for my children. I have no idea what path I would have ended up on if not for them. They have always been my reason for bettering myself, for learning better coping mechanisms and fighting to create an amazing life for them, to let the cycle and the generations of abuse end with me. 

I have never written this all out before, especially in this much detail, and while I know it's insanely long, I hope someone reads it ands gets something out of it. I wish I hadn't felt so alone all those years. I don't know if this all goes away eventually or not but I do know that life was worth all the risks♥️",Shay_Mar,2019-04-23 23:57:09,2,1932,33.89,48.34,88.84,5.13,15.33,14.29,93.94,58.23,21.22,16.72,10.3,1.97,0.16,3.57,0.72,4.5,4.4,13.61,8.13,5.64,7.76,2.02,19.15,4.3,1.92,1.5,1.5,2.12,5.85,1.92,3.88,0.41,2.02,0.52,13.15,2.59,0.47,4.35,1.71,12.68,2.9,1.6,2.33,2.48,2.28,3.16,2.54,0.62,0.93,0.88,2.38,1.04,0.72,0.05,0.62,9.11,3.73,1.19,2.59,1.97,0.36,10.46,5.33,0.67,17.86,2.64,7.35,8.18,1.45,0.67,1.4,0.31,0.16,0,0.36,0.21,0.05,0.05,0.05,0,11.13,6.31,1.92,0,0,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.21,1.86,0.1,0.57

bgwsqx,Mom trying to control where my Dad and I live?,"This is a really hard situation to explain, so if any clarification is needed, please let me know. Over the past few months, DCFS has been involved in my family for medical neglect and as a result, my mom absolutely hates the state where we lived and is convinced that my dad needs to go to Taiwan. My dad has hypertension and hep. B and my mom contends that he needs to see a doctor in Taiwan to get medical treatment, along with seeing a counselor to help his ""mental issues."" (She says that if he doesn't back, he is going to end up having a stroke or heart attack and will die.) She is telling all her friends that I am controlling my dad, making him stay in the U.S., and that we are both manipulative and abusive. She even took it so far to say that if I chose to commit suicide because of being taken back to Taiwan or because of my dad being forced back, that it would be my choice (i.e. it doesn't matter if I kill myself). 

My parents are still together and my mom still has legal custody over me. Right now, the dilemma is that we're in CA and we need to get to IL--which is where we lived and also where my dad works. My mom wants my dad to work remotely from Taiwan or quit his job altogether (please keep in mind that my mom doesn't have a steady income.) My mom is opposed to us going to IL entirely, and wants us to go back to Taiwan, saying that I can give up my high school education in IL and that Dad can give up his job. 

She is constantly messaging my dad and telling her friends that we are abusive. I will be away from home for the next few days, but my mom will be coming home to CA, where my dad is. He has a flight booked to IL on Sunday, but before then, he will still be with my mom for three days. I'm worried that my dad is going to give in to her threats and complaints, or that something worse will happen (she has physically hurt my dad before). I don't know what to do anymore, since even if I reported to DCFS or a government agency, my mom would see that as more the reason to take my dad and I to Taiwan. And if we wanted to file anything, such as a restraining order or have my dad file for single custody, the process takes months, and before then, my mom would also have taken us out of the country.

bgxkef,okay actual vent about my brother,"(sorry for the bold, when there's large walls of text i can't really focus if what's important isn't bold)

&amp;#x200B;

**my parents are divorced and i (15 years old) live with my father and 2 brothers.** **one of my brothers has taken to pounding on my door and yelling at me when he's upset or i do something he doesn't like, take for example my binge/purging. he's pretty openly transphobic, homophobic, misogynistic &amp; ableist.** (i am a lesbian who wears a binder on occasion, i'm autistic and i have a handful of diagnosed mental illnesses.) **he's also anti-semitic, islamophobic, xenophobic, and racist, and has openly endorsed fascist ideologues and saluted to hitler, so. ::::))))) (lethargic and sarcastic cheering)**

&amp;#x200B;

**i told my father about what's going on and was told i should just stop provoking my brother. when i objected, he told me he's just trying to get us to get along.** **i don't want to have to just get along with my brother. there's no way we can just shake hands or agree to disagree when he actively resents me for existing in a way that he doesn't like, which is something that i can't control.**

&amp;#x200B;

**my mom says she's willing to let me stay with her if things get worse. the thing is, my dad is well off. my mom was only just able to afford an internet connection. she lives on the complete other side of the city, which brings issues because of school. i can't really be flexible with school since i'm going to enroll in a charter school that will meet my mental needs. i need smaller classes, college prep focus (meaning i'd be going to a college prep focused school instead of a catholic school or arts focused school), and potentially shorter school days.**

&amp;#x200B;

**even on medication, i can't focus or function in crowded settings, i can't function if it gets too loud, and if i spend too long in a public setting i start panicking.**

&amp;#x200B;

there's also no chance of me being able to run away (and that's not a good idea even if there was). like i said, **i'm on 8 medications**: **5mg melatonin for sleep, 50mg vyvanse for binge eating and adhd, 50mg seroquel for depression and anxiety, 5mg prazosin for sleep and ptsd symptoms, 40mg paxil for panic disorder and depression, &amp; 50mg hydroxyzine for panic attacks.** i also take 1 cap miralax for constipation and 1 cap pepcid for acid reflux. **all of them except hydroxyzine are daily.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**if i skip a dose on prazosin, i'll get severe hypotension. if i skip a dose on the others, i won't get immediate physical withdrawal but i will be suicidal, i won't be able to sleep or focus, i'll get extremely vivid Reliving Trauma nightmares if i do sleep, and i will get panic attacks.**

&amp;#x200B;

***there's a slim chance my brother might find this, so if i randomly delete this thread it may be bc he found it or i'm worried he'll find it. im positive he doesn't use this subreddit, but he does use reddit on occasion (even though his main avenue is 4chan)***

&amp;#x200B;

**my mom told me i should involve my therapist or tell my sister (who lives on her own) what's going on and ask her for advice, but i'm not sure what my next move should be. i'm hesitant to contact my sister bc she's also an ultraconservative. my therapist is completely supportive of me, but even when faced with professional advice that counters his beliefs, my dad has the emotional and sociological capabilities of a moai emoji: 🗿🗿🗿**

My father mentally abused me when I was little. When I did something bad he used to lock me in the dark basement and I was so damn scared of the basement. He also used to tell me that I was fat and lazy. When I cried about it, he told me to stop crying because it's pathetic that I can't take the truth. Added to the fact that I was being bullied in primary school was just great. Yeah... 
I got diagnosed with depression and I'm seeing a therapist.

bh235z,Abuser always apologizes and I always fall for it?,"I don’t know how to deal with this, my “boyfriend” of 2.5 years will blow up over the most trivial crap such as me pushing the bed to the right 2 inches. 

It’s always the same formula: he starts yelling, tells me to leave and that it’s his house even though I’m paying rent to his mother for the right to live here. Then if it gets really bad he will break my keyboard for the computer, often I will try to record this behavior so I can have it if I ever need to make a claim, and he then throws my phone. 

Then I leave for several hours to get away and within an hour him and his mom will blow up my
phone (which does not always survive) trying to apologize and get me to come back home. 

Usually I’m over it within a few hours as it’s easier just to go home rather than try to sleep in my car. Then within a week, something sets him off again. 

I am so scared when he yells and uses his body to intimidate me. Which often leads to me pushing him as I feel like an animal trapped in the corner. 

I always think that “this is the worst time yet” but today I started looking up domestic violence information as I believe I am a victim. I can not afford to leave and live else where as I live pay check to pay check. I am in a pretty tough situation. 

I started telling him terms that I have found on the internet such as him trying to blame the fights and his behavior on me, that it’s my fault, etc. I think this scared him that I am “serious this time” cause this is the first time I’ve gone this far and held my ground this long. 

I really want to leave and not be in this situation anymore but 1. It’s not an option financially and 2. When he apologizes so profusely it’s difficult not to just be like “well alright, but next time..”

bh2e4q,I need help with my mom.,"My mom (41) has been dating this man we will call, Jack (50) for over 10 years now. I’m 21 so he has been around for a while and when I was young I actually liked him. My mom never wanted to get married again after she split with my dad and has always said she needs a man who only comes around on the weekend because she values her independence. I feel there has always been an issue but in the past five years or so things have gotten really bad. She tells me he has never physically hurt her but the mental abuse is really bad and I worry things will escalate. He belittles her, criticizes how she lives, tries to isolate her from friends, gaslights her, creates rumors about her, and even tries to break the bond that she and I share. He acts like a jealous 13 year old and will get very angry if she does not obey him. I have learned to lie to him and act kind and obedient to him because anything I do wrong will be taken out on her. Even if it is something like I am not feeling good and stay in my room he will tell my mom I am worthless and that is a reflection on her. My mom has been saying she wants to break up with him for 3 years now. His mom died right around when he began to act horrible and my mom says that is why he is like he is. She seems to not want to hurt him anymore than he was hurt by his mom’s passing. My mom has tried helping him with the pain but he will not open up. I fear he will begin physically hurting my mom. I have talked to her multiple times about why she does not break up with him. She acknowledges that he is abusive but she will not break up with him. I do not know what to do. Not only is it harmful for her, but it has been emotionally exhausting for me. I miss my old mom. I just want to see her happy again. I’ve told her these things and tried to be supportive.

bh2u02,Is this considered abuse?,"I met him when I was 17, and he was 20. I was really into him, being a desperate 17 y/o girl that's never been in a real relationship. After 6 months, he proposed. I reluctantly said yes. He moved in with my grandmother and I. Soon after that, he started to change. He would blow up at seemingly nothing, then apologize and start crying. I had to comfort him after he viciously yelled at me. He would be passive aggressive, saying things like, ""I'm glad you're not that pretty [talking about a female while we were out] because then I'd have to lock you in the attic so no one else could talk to you."" He regulated what and how much I ate. Some days he wouldn't let me eat anything. He would make me exercise in the hot, Florida, summer sun until I passed out from exhaustion. Even though I had lost 30 pounds, I was ""still fat."" He started to threaten to hurt himself if I ever left. After 4 years of this vicious cycle of being yelled at then having to comfort him, I left him. I was so scared that he was going to come back. I would stay up all night, watching the front door. My phone would freeze because of all the messages he was sending; but I would block every number and account that I thought was him. After seeing him in public near my place (he live 3 towns over and has no reason being there), I moved to Kentucky. Things didn't work out up there, so now I'm back. A few months ago, I got a call, and of course, I answered it. It was him. His voice was soft, and sweet, exactly like when I first met him. We're hanging out again. He doesn't yell at me, but he pouts and gets all sad when I don't wanna fuck, telling him that I have a boyfriend now (which is true). After a few more times of asking, he'll talk about how he bought me a bunch of stuff the week before. I didn't ask for that stuff. Sometimes he doesn't even ask - just takes what he wants. Now, I know THAT is not okay, and its rape, but. That other stuff. Is it mental abuse? Is it manipulation? The guy can only spell at a 3rd grade reading level. He can't be that smart........right?",SnailSauce09,2019-04-24 18:35:50,0,411,11.9,53.89,51.12,2.38,11.74,10.22,94.65,63.26,24.09,17.52,8.52,0.49,0.73,7.79,0,6.57,3.65,12.17,11.92,6.81,7.3,3.16,22.14,5.6,2.43,1.95,2.19,2.43,6.57,1.95,4.62,0.97,2.68,0.97,14.84,0.24,0.49,0.73,8.52,11.92,1.46,1.95,2.68,1.46,2.19,3.16,3.41,0.49,1.7,0.97,2.19,0.24,0.97,0.49,0.97,5.6,1.7,0.73,2.19,0.73,0.49,8.03,9.73,1.95,18.49,1.95,7.3,9.98,0.97,0.49,0.24,0.49,0,0,1.22,0.24,0.24,0.49,0,0,23.11,9.49,6.08,0,0.24,0.97,0,0.24,0.97,3.41,0.97,0.73

bhtqdn,Is this abuse if so please give me some advice,"So I live with my mom who divorced my dad about two years ago. Since living alone with her I've started to pick up on quite a few things. My dad who is a little lazy usually likes it when I help him with things. I usually don't mind doing this because he is always appreciative of my help and makes me feel like I'm loved. My dad is a very kind man and I love being around him. However, on the other hand my mother always demands that I do things and whenever I do I am never offered help and seldom thanked for my help. Most of the things I'm told to do I am yelled at from across the house and expected to do immediately if I takes more than five minutes for me to get to it I am often yelled at again to go do it, nothing explicitly abusive just a not so subtle reminder that, ""I asked to do something."" Most of the things that I am told that I should do are small but what annoys me about this particular instance is that in the amount of time my mom takes to tell me to do these things she very easily could do them herself, the most common one I can think of is walking the dogs (which I do on a regular basis anyway, but only neglect to do if I am doing something and someone else is downstairs aka her). This is just a little something that has been wearing down on me since the divorce. I definitely appreciate my dad a lot more because I now know one of the things he had to deal with (he also took care of both the dogs at all times). Another thing that has annoyed me to no end is the difference in the way I am treated in comparison to my sister who is three years older than me and in college. She has always had a hard time doing anything that resembled work around the house. If asked to do something like vacuum the house it might take her up to two weeks to do it, whereas the longest it take me to get to this has been two days. She is never held accountable for cleaning up after herself by my mom something I have complained about countless times to her but she never says a thing to my sister to get this to change. My sister started dating this one guy who my mom adores and they are basically given free roam of wherever they want whereas me and my girlfriend are not allowed in a room with the door closed and my mom constantly waits in the next room listening in on us. As kids I was bullied a lot in school (all levels) and at home by my sister, who my mom never ""punished"" in front of me because she thought I might think that she had favorites (her words) so instead I never even knew if my sister had been punished for things like slamming my hand in a door or trying to poke out my eyes or verbal abuse. In fact I hardly ever even knew when she was in trouble let alone what it was for. Additionally my sister's tuition is about 3 times mine (my mom started complaining about money as soon as I started looking at colleges) for reference my mom said she will pay for 4 years of undergrad for both of us (she makes a fucking ton of money). Also she continuously encourages my sister living an extravagant lifestyle, my sister was given a second master bedroom in the house and two walk in closets and a walk in bathroom. I lived in a room less than half the size of hers until after the divorce which I was allowed to move into another room that we didn't use anymore presumably because she wants to keep up the appearances of being a good mother to anyone who visits the house. Anyway the real problem I have with all of this is that when my sister started dating her current boyfriend she was only about 1 year older than I am right now and yet she was treated vastly differently. I know that differences can be chalked up to different people but even before my parents were divorced I was the responsible one, doing more around the house getting into trouble less and working harder at school. So the real problem I have here is that my sister is still allowed to be lazy and gets more money spent on her while I am treated like the one who isn't well behaved and lazy and gets next to nothing in comparison (note this only applies to my mom, my dad treats us both very fairly and equally). Additionally I recently started to notice multiple forms of manipulation my mom participates in with me in particular. One of my dogs died a few years ago, she had a growth in her stomach that ruptured and cause internal bleeding. So we took her to the vet as soon as possible (just me and my mom) and when we got there they said we can save her, or you can euthanize her. My mom then told me about how our old dog (she was ten at the time, black lab) probably wouldn't live much longer even if we had the surgery and about the price (this was all done rather subtly through her use of an anecdote of her friend who fosters dogs) and basically made it seem like the worst option (or at least like she would spend a ridiculous amount of money on something that might not prolong our dogs life much longer) and then told me it was my choice (I was 14 or 15) so I ""chose"" to have my dog euthanized and then I sat there and watched my best friend of the past ten years die all while she told me how they had to put her dog down when she was younger and how she couldn't bring herself to be with it when they killed it. (Also she complained to me about the price of the euthanization the next week). So basically I was a fucking mess after this and spent the next week crying basically nonstop because I felt so guilty because I had killed my best friend. She took off a week of work and let me take off one day of school. The next week she tried to talk me into getting a new dog. So basically this is the reason I spent the next two years depressed and even seriously considered suicide twice. Also when I got my permit for driving one day I didn't want to go out for lunch and she was in the car with me so I said, ""Im going to go home for lunch"" and she said she no your going to this restaurant with me, but I was driving so I went home. She started ""crying"" (Ive become extremely skeptical of her crying at anytime after this event) for reference I had only ever seen her cry before when my dog died and both times it seemed fake. And basically tried to guilt trip me into going to lunch with her and trying to make me feel bad basically because I was fucking depressed and extremely apathetic and didn't ever want to leave the house. So the next week I was talking to my sister and she told me that my mom said ""Oh, yeah I definitely overreacted a bit there."" about that particular event. She not once spoke about it to me or apologized to me about her overreaction. Also every time I drove with her after that she found something to criticize about my driving and yelled at me to start breaking when I was basically at a full stop already (I also find this in particular to be extremely hypocritical because she pulls up less than a foot behind the car in front of her when she drives). She has also repeatedly throughout my childhood called me out for things I've done wrong in public spaces (always a few weeks or months and a few time even years after it) these are always things that I have expressed that I was deeply disappointed in myself or that I heavily criticized myself for having done and yet she felt the need to call public attention to them in front of strangers despite knowing that I was one incredibly shy and ashamed of all these things. More recently though she has started saying that I can be an asshole to her when I want to be. This is always when I am in a depressive mood (I am no longer chronically depressed but I still get depressive for a few days every month or so) and don't want to be around anyone and to be left alone or in response to her doing one of the aforementioned things or just generally treating me like shit so yeah sometimes I want her to leave me alone and not talk to her but in her mind its always because Im an ""asshole"" and could not possibly be in response to her in anyway. She even straight up told my girlfriend that I can be an asshole at dinner one night (for reference my girlfriend is my best friend and one of the few people who I feel comfortable around and the only person who I trust enough to tell basically anything personal about myself, I'm a very private person). All of this has led me to think that my mom is narcissistic or at least has a lot of the traits that would define a person as such. I would like the opinions of others on this and some advice on if this is a salvageable relationship, if it might get better once I leave for college, or if I should just take her offer of college tuition and gtfo. I am about to leave for college, I've committed and will be going there in a few months so I feel like I've put up with her this long I can probably stay and get some free tuition out of this toxic relationship.",Wha423,2019-04-26 17:53:01,3,1745,31.4,42.72,76.18,5.87,37.13,13.81,95.82,62.69,21.09,14.73,9.51,0.57,0.11,4.13,0.4,6.36,5.16,14.96,9.05,7.91,8.42,1.38,17.42,5.44,3.72,1.78,1.78,2.81,4.99,1.49,3.32,0.23,1.26,0.86,12.09,2.12,0.52,5.39,0.74,12.49,1.89,1.89,1.72,3.78,1.95,3.32,1.6,0.34,0.69,0.57,1.78,0.63,0.57,0.17,0.34,6.19,2.35,0.8,1.66,1.49,0.52,5.85,9.68,0.97,16.39,1.89,6.65,7.85,0.8,0.17,1.15,0.97,0,0.34,0.8,0.4,0,0.11,0.11,0.17,7.56,2.64,1.15,0,0,0,0,0,0.8,0.92,2.06,0
bhvyje,How to live without abuse when it feels foreign?,"It is the strangest feeling when you don't have someone criticizing you harshly,  or waiting for the other foot to drop,  or feeling that horrible feeling in the pit of your stomach of fear,  not knowing what could happen next or when everything would go up in the air?

bi1kia,They claim it isn't abuse,"I'll start off with saying I have a sister that's 4 years older than I am, she never got the same treatment I did and rarely got into trouble.

I'm the type of person that likes to just sit upstairs out of the way, my family tend to ignore me when I talk to them or get angry when I dont talk to them enough. 

I'll stick with the recent event, so I decided to move out and my family suddenly got really stir crazy, I was tired of how they were acting, bossing me around and generally treating me like a slave. All I wanted to do was play my playstation. It came to a point my mother sent me to a doctor for medication because 'something is clearly wrong with me' however when confronted she said that she sent me for mental help not medication even though her text said medication. 

The doctor agreed I was in a controlling home and it wasnt healthy. So my parents kicked me out and I've been at my sisters for a little under a month. My sister has said every day that she doesnt want me here, my parents decided that they dont want me there either after I called them controlling because they dont think they are.

So after a lot of me feeling so unwanted and those people complaining that neither side want me in their lives, my parents take me back in temporarily until I get a new job (lost due to change in management) and move out. With a BUNCH of rules. Basically saying my switch and playstation will get locked away and I will get a designated gaming time. 

I wont be able to spend any time by myself in my room, I must spend it with my family. I'm not allowed my headphones in with them either even though they help me relax even if I'm not playing anything and I MUST do what I'm told. Basically i need to ask permission to breathe and they get to treat me like im 5....again. I'm 23.

But they dont see this as controlling and this is what made me lose my mind to begin with....all of the above happened cause I asked for more freedom.......",SnowPhoenix13,2019-04-27 10:44:46,1,386,20.19,15.61,93.96,18.16,22.71,11.66,95.6,61.92,23.58,19.17,14.51,0,0,1.3,3.37,4.4,4.4,14.51,9.59,7.25,7.77,3.37,22.28,4.92,3.37,1.55,0.78,2.33,4.66,2.07,2.59,0,0.78,0.52,11.92,2.59,0,2.33,0,12.69,1.04,2.59,2.33,2.07,1.81,4.15,1.81,0.26,1.3,0.26,2.07,0.26,1.81,0,0,9.84,2.85,0.78,3.89,2.33,1.04,6.74,13.21,1.3,14.25,1.81,6.48,6.22,1.04,2.33,1.3,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.47,7.77,2.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.11,0.52,0
bi39j5,I am thankful for the positive things in my life,"A month ago I left my girlfriend of 6 years . She suffers from severe mental illness, and because of that ive had a horrible time. mental illness is an awful burden and despite what she has put me through I hope she gets better. However,  understanding is not enough. I realised that nothing was going to change and I had to leave.

Since I've left, I've struggled with my own thoughts. I felt that my life had ended. Worried about whether I made the right decision by leaving . Agonising over losing the future I always wanted and planned for. Missing her like crazy. Mourning over the loss of a lifelong companion.

  But during this period of loss I've been reminded of the good things in my life. My family, especially with my parents, who invited me back into their home and helped me move out and have been really supportive. My best friend; she is the best and I cannot ever repay her for the support she has given me. My other friends,  who have been there and have listened to me when I've been through low periods. My boss,  who noticed when I was down and made sure I was ok.

To anyone out there that is suffering now or ever has been  through abuse, I hope you have one person to turn to. Someone who can pick you up and help you move on. Because even during your darkest days, there is someone who will listen. Someone who will help.

bi3koz,Advice/support???,"So my used to work a lot but retired 9 years ago, and having him home 24/7 made us all eventually realize how abusive he is. He would never pay for anything and made us feel guilty for asking for groceries or takeout, despite he fact he makes $100k+ (even now while he's retired and has done nothing but sit at his computer for 9 years). My mom works in homecare, and has gone periods without work, and thus racked up a lot of credit card debt in buying us kids clothes, food, and replacing things like fridges and couches that break. She's 60 years old now and the work is getting too physical for her. She was an Irish immigrant that worked off the books for 30 years, so she'll get no social security, but a small pension from when she worked in Ireland. We worry about the effects on us of living with a man that has no feelings except anger and disgust for his family. He has a rifle and I have a vague worry about a day when he'll completely snap. He sits in the middle of our house on his computer ignoring us, but listening to us and watching us 24/7 from the mirrored glass case he sits in front of, sucking the energy out of us. Unrelated but I was sexually abused when I was 4 by a doctor and spent most of my life completely dissociating in stressful situations. Only 2 years ago I remembered/became conscious of that abuse, and only then became conscious of how crazy my family is. There's no way we could move right now, we'd never afford housing in nyc. My sister graduated college a year ago and is still unemployed, and not very confident in her capabilities for most jobs. I graduated and have been working and paying off my student loans and saving up for Masters degree, necessary to earning more in my field ($40k+). My mom is saving a little while continuing to pay her large credit card debt that she will ultimately never pay off. Additional costs keep coming up, like her having to spend $2000 on her teeth. The elderly woman she takes care of is in bad shape and might pass away soon, which would mean being out of work again. If she can save, she and my sister want to move back to rural Ireland, especially because its more affordable. I have always wanted to move to a city in the UK. I would be close and could do a masters and eventual PhD, even though there's not a lot of funding for international students. I met a guy here from there and he has been my only relief. But since he went back the distance has been too great that I feel like I'm losing him and he says he'd want a girlfriend that's there in the meantime. I'm applying to programs for this September. Moving for me and especially my mom and sister feels like a pipe dream, and we're all being crippled by the stress/pressure more and more everyday.

I realize there's an awful lot to unpack here and I'm not even sure what I'm seeking by posting. Just maybe the chance to not feel so alone and helpless and hopeless.",croissants4u,2019-04-27 14:02:34,0,558,40.34,65.34,33.59,8.6,21.46,15.05,92.29,57.71,14.87,12.37,4.66,2.33,0,5.38,0,2.51,5.38,13.8,8.78,8.42,9.32,2.15,18.64,3.76,1.97,1.25,1.97,2.15,5.38,1.97,3.41,1.08,0.72,0.72,11.29,1.43,0.36,3.58,3.58,13.44,2.69,1.79,1.61,2.33,2.87,2.87,1.43,0.18,0.36,0.9,1.61,0.36,0.72,0.18,0.36,9.5,3.76,2.15,2.69,1.08,0.54,4.12,11.47,1.61,15.23,1.61,7.53,6.27,5.91,0.72,1.25,3.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.8,4.48,3.58,0,0,0.54,0,0,0,2.69,0.72,1.79

bi6e46,It's Common: Lucy,"Hey Everyone!

I'm new to reddit, and looking towards the community for some advice.

I'm helping one of my best friends, Lucy, film a series of profiles about people narrating their sexual assault and we're both looking for the best way of raising awareness for the series. The process of shooting, retelling of events, and re-enactments have been very therapeutic for her and others who have come in and shared their stories. We just want to provide an opportunity for people who would like to talk about their experiences an opportunity to do so.

What would be the best way of encouraging others to come in and speak about their assault? Should we target larger organizations to collaborate on something like this or should we keep it on an individual smaller scale? We'd love to travel the country giving people the opportunity to empower themselves, so if anyone has any leads that would be most appreciated.

bi84a7,I Have Nowhere and Nobody to Seek Shelter,"I’m currently 18, a senior in high school, and am still living under my parents’ roof with no car or job. My parents harp me with all sorts of demeaning, nasty remarks of how spoiled I was or how selfish I was for putting my own health before my family... for example, my sister always gets $300 for hair color every month and if I asked my mother for $20 every once in a while for a new game or something, she would go Momzilla and call me a selfish brat who demands too much of the family. My walls are barren, my desk is run down, my night table is almost splitting apart, my bedroom lamp is in shackles, just imagine Cinderella’s bedroom... I have almost nothing besides a used cell phone to call “property”. My sister on the other hand, does nothing to contribute to the family, whines about doing any sort of housework and somehow ends up never doing it, and still is rewarded with new clothes, the latest makeup, and she just got a new cell phone too. I don’t understand why. We’ll occasionally take trips to Disneyland for 3 days but all my Mom wants is pictures. She doesn’t even really enjoy the rides anymore... but I digress. My father, whom has abandoned us 3 times in the past, is the secondary target of my mothers absolutely hypocritical and disgraceful language and accusations. She blames him if a house maintenance worker shows up late from traffic, she blames him if my sister acts out over a petty situation, she even blames him for my grandfather needing a metal hip operation. She never seems to be in the wrong however. She condemns swearing, but cusses my father and I out almost daily, she hates the use of technology but almost always has her nose buried in Facebook trying to sweet talk her “friends” into believing she’s a literal angel. Plus she talks so much shit behind our backs and practically pits the members of the house against each other, as if we were born to entertain her. I can’t take anymore of it! The worst part, when I bring up anything that could bring any negativity to my mother’s private, household reputation, I’m told to shut the fuck up and deal with it. I cry myself to sleep almost every single night. I hate having to survive emotionally in such a primal manner. No person should have to argue with their own family over something as petty as how long someone took a shower the night before or who used the most data on the phone plan. My mother drives the anger train in me and she knows she does. She constantly instigates situations in which I have to argue endlessly while she keeps mimicking everything I say unless it’s a swear word, in which case she’ll slap me dead across the face... I’ve told therapists, counselors, even friends about the situation at home and nobody believes me... I can’t live like this forever... help!

bibqjx,When fear stops being your motivator?,"Hey there, so my story: Was with a dude for nearly 4 years. I was very much a codependent people-pleaser (gradually getting better at saying ""no"" and setting boundaries these days), and I deeply loved this man. He had a very sweet, loving, sensitive side, but a *very* scary side when he lost his temper, which was increasingly often. I've always been a ""caretaker"" in relationships, and I naively thought if I just loved him more, put more effort into the relationship, and focused more on supporting him, we'd eventually have a happy relationship. Surprise! Super wrong. You can't love somebody enough to stop their vicious mood swings, or stop them from berating you and towering over you because you accidentally asked too many questions in a conversation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried my best to be supportive, and that resulted in me doing the lion's share of the work in the house. I cooked the majority of meals, took care of our pets, worked two jobs, did the laundry and most of the dishes, and random other chores. Of course, that wasn't enough to keep him from getting upset with me over random things or interactions, but I continued to try to do more in order to keep the peace. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing. We've been broken up for a year now, and I haven't accomplished much of my personal goals. I don't know if it's just depression or PTSD from the situation, but I barely work now, my apartment is dirty, dishes stay in the sink for days at a time, and a good part of me wants to (and often succeeds) in sleeping all day, or just staring off into space. Part of me thinks maybe I'm just still healing from it all, but basic things need to get done regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

 I think I'm realizing that a lot of my productivity came from 1) trying to prevent fights and 2) trying to be appreciated by him. Now that it's just me, there's nobody to scream in my face that I'm not doing enough, but there's also nobody besides myself to say I did a good job or put in solid effort. I know it's downright stupid to lack motivation for basic care (like paying bills and buying groceries), but these last few weeks I've been especially lazy/depressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

biiq3n,Do I Trust Him?,"My dad is neglectful and manipulative, and he emotionally and physically abused my siblings and I for our whole lives. I’m 17. 

This past year, I got out of the household and into a safe place. I’m still in touch with my dad, and today he told me that he is ready to change. I got to tell him things that I’ve been wanting to share with him, like the way he’s made me feel and actions of his that caused deep pain, that he was blind to. He told me that he was wanting to hear the hard things and that he wanted to change to be a better dad, which is a step up from a year ago when he hated hearing criticism. 

I can see that he has changed in some ways. And I’m proud of him. But there are deep rooted problems that he needs to face and hasn’t, like his disrespect for women and using his kids for his own personal gain. I’m afraid to open up to him about how he’s made me feel. He’s used my vulnerability in the past for his own agenda and I am terrified of that happening again. I know that people can genuinely change- I changed so much when I got out of that abusive space- but I don’t know if this is for real. I’ve heard so many apologizes from him in the past. What am I supposed to do if this isn’t any different? How do I heal from something like that?

biityz,"My boyfriend put his hands on me for the first time last night, I've known him for two years.","My boyfriend did something last night and I don't know how to move on or process it. I know I should cut it off, but more than anything I want his comfort more right now. He's driving over now. I feel so weak for asking for him but I don't know who else to turn to. He also broke my phone by accident during the altercation.

The full story is embarrassing. We decided we wanted to try having a threesome and invited a girl from Tinder over to see where things went. There was some ambiguity, but she knew that hooking up was on the table and that he and I were more than friends, and him and I decided to see how it went, and if nothing happened, we would at least all have fun together. She ended up leaving around 3 a.m., while I was in the bathroom. No threesome happened. Him and I were upset with how each other handled interacting with her but were poker facing it in front of her. While I was in the bathroom, I heard him talking normally to her and I didn't think he was super drunk. When I came out of the bathroom in the bedroom, he was sitting on his bed with his legs crossed waiting for me. He began yelling at me and I yelled back and we were arguing. I went to pack my bags to leave and came back in the bedroom to grab my phone charger. He grabbed me and held my arms to my body and shoved me down on the bed and then got on top of me. He held me down, and then pinned my arms under his knees and told me it would be easy for him to kill me if he wanted to, but that he's not that evil of a person. At one point I begged him to fuck me just to try to pull him back and calm him down. I’m ashamed of this.

I was struggling and begging for him to get off of me as he called me names and was saying a bunch of things. Then he picked me up slightly off the bed and threw me to the ground off his bed. I hit my face and have a swollen spot/light bruise. My phone screen cracked completely and is now unusable. He continued to yell at me for about three hours. I begged and pleaded and argued with him back. He pushed his body up against me several times but made a point to hold his hands away from his body and was making comments like ""See cops, I didn't lay a hand on her!"" For reference, we are both the same height and he is about 30 pounds heavier than me. He berated me and started playing mean songs and telling me that they all were about me. He told me that he has been ""dealing with me at a level 4 brain, but level 5 brain was aware of all of my manipulation and victim playing and level six brain always had an eye on everything and wouldn't allow it anymore"". At one point he blasted music and began jumping around dancing energetically and going on a rant about how horrible I was for tricking him into dating him, and so on and so forth. That I was \*lucky\* that he loved me, that at least I had that going for me. This morning he acknowledged what he did and apologized but then brushed past it very quickly and focused on what I did wrong. I don't know where to go from here. I know the smart thing is to leave and move on but I have no one else.",GullibleExample,2019-04-28 18:49:05,8,649,33.76,45.7,72.86,11.73,18.54,11.71,94.61,62.87,23.27,18.64,10.02,0.77,0,7.7,0.15,4.62,3.85,16.18,7.24,4.47,10.32,1.54,19.11,4.01,2,1.54,1.69,2,4.47,1.69,2.77,0.77,1.08,0.15,13.25,0,0.46,1.08,7.09,10.48,2.31,1.39,1.54,1.54,1.08,3.39,3.7,0.92,1.54,1.23,3.08,2.31,0.31,0.15,0.15,6.78,2,0.77,3.54,0.46,0.15,8.94,6.78,0.92,18.18,3.54,9.86,5.55,0,1.69,1.39,0.15,0,0.15,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0,11.09,5.55,2.47,0,0,0,0.15,0,0.62,1.54,0,0.77
bika0v,Bipolar mom,"My mom HAS been clinically diagnosed with bipolar. She takes Prozac. I don’t think it works. All the time, I’ll do something and she’ll find a way to make it seem like I’m ignoring her. She’ll make extremely false assumptions which when I call her out for it, she’ll tell me that I’m the one doing it. Then she’ll tell everyone else about whatever stupid situation from her false perspective. They’ll all take her side. It has me cutting again. It’s the only way to keep the explosive, adrenaline filled anger down. I’m tired of her shit. I can’t make friends easily. I can never go out of the house. I started homeschooling this year and I’m isolated. 

Sometimes, she’ll take me with her to the grocery store. She’ll buy me food and be all nice and shit. I’m never sure if I should trust her. She’ll tell me I can talk with her about anything. I don’t. She turns it into a drama. I’ll go to therapy but I don’t say anything in fear that they’ll talk to my mom and she’ll explode on me and be like “how could you do this to me. I thought we had a close relationship.”

I believe I have inherited bipolar from her but I haven’t been diagnosed clinically yet. I have been for OCD. No doctor has done anything about it yet. I’ve had antidepressants thrown my way, which they only make my situation worse. They make me suicidal. I don’t know what to fucking do. I haven’t been to my therapist in a month. I could ask my therapist not to talk to my mom about her problems, but I don’t think that will achieve anything.

I’ve abused other meds like falsely prescribed amphetamines, inhalants, and listerine for the alcohol. It helped me escape from my mom. I’m pretty sure it’s on my permanent record. This means I probably won’t get a Valium prescription since it’s addictive. I need one though. Maybe a tranquilizer?

I am currently in a new relationship with a loving and caring partner. However, as all relationships have, when we break out into disagreements and arguments, I am incapable of thinking and acting rationally. Often I find myself completely shutting down when my partner and I have an argument. I want to stress this: these arguments/ differences are in no way abusive or manipulative. I don’t know how to act or respond in a healthy way.

biud32,Is it normal that I feel and behave this way? May it be because of toxic person?,"When I was young I had this bestfriend that i really liked, he was the only one who would hear me and hug me (I didnt had any friends, and my family didn't care much), he would have quite deep conversations with me, and I became really ""dependent"" of him, because he was my only friend.

I would trust every single word he said, it didnt matter how silly ou unbelievable it might seem.

And then he started trying to be more intimate with me, and he would hug me way more and try to kiss me and all, and even though I thought it was a bit weird, he would say it was normal and I would believe him.

And then he slowly started being a bit more rude with me, and he would make me feel like I was the one who made him be that way.

And slowly he was becoming more sexual, but at that point I could clearly see that anything more than kiss was extremely inappropriate and it was clearly not right, so I started refusing and he would became really furious and start threatening me, in different ways, he would say he would hurt me or hurt the people I love, and that scared the fuck out of me, because I really loved my father even though he didnt give me much attention, and being young and naive, I really thought he would hurt them, but I ended up being the only one being hurt, he only made me do things like making him feel pleasure, but i had pretty good luck and he didnt actually had time to really rape me, because he thought I would always be his slave, because i was really weak and it was easy to manipulate me, so he take his time appreciating having me obeying him, we would spend weeks without seeing each other, because we lived quite away, but our moms were friends and so did we were, in that weeks we wouldn't see each other, he would torture me in a different way, he would keep telling me how he would hurt me and we would use the threats to make me agree with everything.

After some months, he finally wanted to really ""rape me"", but I was really scared, and I just could think of ways to escape, eventually my father ended up finding when i was crying and crying because I finally couldn't handle it, and we went to the police and solved everything, it took quite the time, since they needed to investigate to be sure of what he was doing, and they even find out that he was doing that to other girls as well.

I eventually, notice that I changed, and I feel really scared of people, sometimes even just going outside freaks me out, I always feel pressured to be quiet, because I feel scared of my own voice, I always think the worst about people, and tried to be prepared so that I dont get hurt again, I feel in completely agony because I worry too much about every little thing, especially at school becaus people leave me really nervous, to the point I sometimes cry in the bathrooms

And I keep thinking that maybe this was his fault, but I am not sure, could it be possible that it was his fault, I dont really know",HimeNoir000,2019-04-29 13:32:46,0,587,2.83,29.27,54.23,5.64,65.22,11.24,97.79,64.91,25.04,18.4,10.9,1.19,0,5.79,0.51,6.64,2.39,8.18,12.78,8.18,10.22,2.04,24.02,4.77,2.21,1.19,0.68,3.07,8.69,3.41,5.28,1.53,1.36,1.7,12.78,0.68,0.68,0.34,6.13,23.34,4.26,3.75,4.09,3.07,2.56,6.13,3.75,0.51,1.02,2.21,1.53,0,0.51,0.68,0,7.5,3.24,0.68,1.87,0.85,1.19,8.18,8.35,1.36,10.22,1.19,3.92,5.45,0.51,0.34,0.34,0.34,0,0,0.68,0.34,0,0.17,0.17,0,11.58,1.02,8.69,0,0,0.34,0,0,0.68,0.51,0.34,0
biuo82,"Mom, you are upset because you abused me and got caught","We started fighting three months ago. You told me I shouldn't be putting my problems on your plate. I told the times I could count on you were rare throughout my whole life. Once again you were lashing out instead of speaking to me normally. You got upset. I told you to cut the bullshit and pointed out that if you couldn't handle kids, you shouldn't have had them. You got more offended. I got angry at you for letting me stay in an abusive home (my dad was more abusive). She asked me what else she should have done. I told her she should have left. She looked me in the eye and told me she worked to hard to give up on that money (prenup). She also couldn't do that to my sister. I went hysterical, blaming you for keeping me in a house with a father that didn't want me.  She walked out. 

I went upstairs and my dad asked me what happened. I lost my shit and cried like a baby that he didn't want me. What did I learn that night, when I was crying on my dad's lap? He never in his life said that. My mother refused to apologize the next day, for anything apart from the night before.

Not much later, I picked another fight with her, after she did her famous 'twisting the story' again. I told her I was done with the lying and this would be her chance to come clean if she really lied about my dad. She admitted it. I told her if she wanted a relationship with me, she needed to put in the work. 

I was still not satisfied and decided to confront her in person. I was the bigger person and was calm the whole time. I kept pushing for the reason. What was the reason my mom lied to me and isolated me from my father?

I was such a difficult child. From birth I cried so much and I wasn't affectionate enough. In her whole being I could feel she blamed me. I told her that was ridiculous, I pointed out the adults around me had the responsibility, after she asked me who I 'blamed'. She wondered if I also looked at myself. 

My mother who wouldn't raise her daughter, was upset when her daughter showed the same antisocial behaviour she demonstrated all her life. 

She's not made an effort to make up for this. Despite my offer for her to come to therapy with me. My dad on the other hand has apologized extensively. I might have felt like I grew up without parents, I know at least have a father. One that will never make up for his mistakes, because it's too late for that. At least have started building a new relationship from here. 

I'm now nearing my 30s and I'm closer to being a good person than my mom has ever been. Therapy has greatly helped me, but it's due to myself that I'm close to being a 'normal' person. I've shown traits of PTSD and borderline and I'm close to testing as a 'normal' person in the psychological tests. Not because I'm faking it, but because I've put all my efforts into losing that paranoid, self-destructive mind. I've been bullied and isolated extensively, so her severe mental issues had become the template for my impressions and emotions for the longest time. 

It's been a long journey, but I finally feel alive and in control of my mind. The world is not mean and out to get me, but a place where I experience things. Things that don't dictate all my emotions and thoughts anymore, but things I'm in charge of. I decide what I think and do as a response to my environment, not the other way around.

I'm not going to always feel this way, but moments like this make up for a lot of my past. At days like this, I feel everything feels a little brighter than it does to 'normal people'. Not because I'm great, but because I dug my way out of my own hell.

bivarf,The RIGHT things to say to an abused person.,"I was a victim of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse so I am aware of how certain comments can be triggering, even if they are intended to help. I would like to focus on the heartwarming responses you have heard. 

What are some helpful, comforting, emotionally supportive things you wish people said to you more often regarding your abuse history? 

For me personally, it helps to hear things like: 

""I am so grateful you got away from that!"" 

""Going back to him is not an option. You are safe."" 

""I don't want to hurt you, you've suffered enough. Can I do anything for you?"" 

""I don't understand your pain. But would you like to talk about it?"" 

""I do not understand how you feel, but I care about you any way."" 

""What do you need to heal?"" 

""You did not deserve it. Your abuse was not your choice. "" 

""Many people failed to acknowledge you when you were being abused, so I don't expect you to trust me. Just know that I am here."" 

""Your suffering will not change how much I care for you"" 

"" You are NOT a burden to your loved ones because you are dealing with the aftermath of the abuse."" 

""You didn't ask to be harmed like this. Even if you did, you did not deserve it.""

biwb15,Stuck in mental jail,"I grew up abused. My mother was a toxic narc who once told me to be quiet and move on about being molested by an uncle as a small child. 
December 2015 I had enough of our toxic relationship and told her to stop contacting me and my family until she get mental health help. She was starting to abuse my kids the same way she abused me. I told her I felt that beyond the toxic narc issue she also seemed to fit the manic/depressive cycle. To get help. Get meds. Apologize. And then after all that maybe we can heal and grow. Instead. My mother completed suicide last summer. 
I pretend I’m ok. That I’m finally free.

However, I never got to know him and most of his family says he's a nice man , but he did end up killing himself when my mom left him. The only memory I remember of him was when he showered us with presents but he was never really present.
When I was around 7 my mom, my sister, and I moved to live with this other family because we couldn't afford a place to live. My mom would work the whole week without any breaks, but when she was allowed a break at nights she would often leave my sister &amp; I to go party. It was hurtful seeing her leave when it was time for us to go to bed because that was really the only time we saw her.
I think she tried to ignore the fact that me and my sister were being mentally &amp; physically abused because she wouldn't have anywhere to go. The family we lived with consisted of a mother, a father, and 2 sons. The mother was obsessed with my moms whereabouts, so I feel like my mom went out a lot because she felt trapped, but that just resulted in us getting comfort from the woman. She would often tell us how my mom didn't love us &amp; she would only be the one who would ever love us. I wasn't aware that my sister would often receive more mental abuse from the woman &amp; her younger son. I can only recall  4 experiences that still traumatize me today.
1: The father had me perform oral sex on him when I was around 8
2: The oldest son showed my sister &amp; I his penis
3: The oldest son sexually abused me in the pool 
4: The oldest son sexually abused me in his room when my mom &amp; his mom were in the living room.
I thought this was perfectly normal because he had showed us porn when I was 7. I also remember my mom seeing that he was sexually abusing me in his bed , but she just got me off &amp; started crying. This still didn't stop her from leaving us there while she went to meet up with people. I haven't seen those people in about 5 years. The only news I know is that the oldest son was arrested for child pornography.
When we were still with the family she started going out to see this guy named 'C' , we didn't figure this out until the woman told us that she had been seeing someone. This angered my sister &amp; I so one night she took my sister &amp; I to his house to get my mom while she proceeded to scratch his car. Long story short, 'C' ended up calling the cops. The only reason we got out from the family's house is because the woman was stealing my mom's jewelry &amp; my mom had already established a relationship with 'C' so that meant we could move in with him.
'C' was kind but it was only a facade. He ended up being as mentally abusive as the woman. There are a series of situations which sum up how I got here today.
- The very first warning sign was when he came drunk from a gathering because my mom kept calling him to know his whereabouts. He came home drunk &amp; started pushing her , then he closed the door behind me &amp; my sister's room. He then told us that he loved us &amp; that my mom didn't. My mom was trying to get into our room , but she could only enter when he opened the door but at this point he just started pushing her into the the living room &amp; started screaming at her
- He also gets mad at the tiniest things such as: we're being to loud that he can't hear the tv, he fights about food. One time he threw food on my mom because it was cold
- I think the biggest thing I can't forget is when he slapped my mom &amp; threatened her with his gun. Me &amp; my sister were awake &amp; he noticed so he shut our door &amp; told us to go back to sleep. I don't know what caused him to get mad but we ended up calling the police &amp; he was only to complete AA meetings. He was also ordered by the police to stay at home. So that very day , he slept on the couch, but my mom told him he could go with her to the room. The worst part of it all is that she ended up getting pregnant. 
This was honestly the only period of time where he helped her &amp; when I mean help I mean he finally did stuff on his own such as got up and put food on his own plate and ate it. He wasn't even a great help then.
- My brother is already 1 year old , and I feel like he's already witnessing his father's abuse. The most recent case is when I screamed at my brother because he was hitting my nephew with a hanger, it wasn't even a scream to scare him. But of course his father came and got him &amp; told me that I shouldn't be screaming at him. He then pulled my little brother in his room &amp; started arguing with my mom. I'm a very private person when it comes to my emotions, but I started crying automatic which kind of scared me because at that point I realized how much abuse I had been experiencing. 
My mom still hasn't left the guy &amp; I'm honestly worried one day he will just snap &amp; end up killing her. However, she always puts him above us. I remember vividly her asking us if we wanted her to leave him &amp; I responded yes but here we are 5-6 years later in the same shithole. I'm about to turn 16 &amp; can't wait to leave. Sometimes I honestly believe them when they said my mom never loved us because she's been putting us an abusive household for 10 years. I don't get what she sees in the guy. I mean she can't wear dresses because he doesn't want her to, she has to reply right away or he thinks she's cheating on him. 
I wrote this because I honestly have no one who can help me because my mom will end up getting pissed if I talk to someone about it. I confronted her about it but she's still with him. I'm honestly just worried about my little brother. Do you have any recommendations on how I could help my brother or better take custody over him when I can? Because I feel like his parents are not mentally right.",Rosecerna,2019-04-29 19:07:16,0,1159,17.57,83.52,48.05,5.03,21.07,12.42,93.01,59.19,24.5,20.1,8.46,2.5,0.09,8.89,0.17,4.4,5,10.7,8.46,7.42,7.16,2.16,18.72,2.85,1.98,2.42,1.81,0.95,4.83,1.38,3.36,0.52,1.9,0.26,21.23,4.92,0.26,6.56,7.51,10.87,2.42,1.98,1.47,1.55,0.78,3.28,2.33,0.86,0.69,0.6,2.5,0.52,0.6,0.69,0.52,9.49,5.35,0.6,2.16,1.73,0.35,8.89,7.85,0.6,16.91,2.67,6.82,7.59,0.6,0.78,1.98,0,0,0.17,0.26,0.17,0,0.09,0,0,15.44,4.57,1.9,0.43,2.24,0.09,0,0.43,0,3.54,0,2.24

biz2b0,I can’t tell if my parents simply didn’t know what they were doing or it they were emotionally abusive,"SUMMARY; 

Dad- alcoholic, drove drunk and with alcohol in the car, screamed in my face until I was scared he would hit me. Hyper critical to where I felt like I was never good enough. 

Mom- guilted me with “you don’t love me anymore,” punished me for self harming, got in screaming matches with me and physically restrained me from getting away from her after begging to have space to calm down.

Both- got divorced and make me their messenger, talked shit about each other to me constantly. 


When they divorced it was always “tell your dad this tell your mom this” bc they couldn’t communicate with each other since they hated each other. They talked shit about each other to me constantly. I was 11. My dad used to scream at me and get up in my face to where I was afraid he would hit me. Once he did this in front of my friends, they were shocked and I didn’t get why because i was used to it. 

He was an alcoholic and used to drive drunk with me in the car and also drive with beer in the car with me. Once he took my friend and I to a football game and she was scared for him to drive us home because he had been drinking so much, I did get it because i was used to it. I told my dad to please stop drinking because it made my friend uncomfortable and he got furious at me.

He could change his attitude at the flip of a switch. I would be crying in the car because he was yelling at me then we would go inside wherever we were and he would turn on the charm as if that didn’t just happen while I’m holding in tears still. 

He was hypercritical too he told me I was too skinny, when I gained some weight he said I looked “chunky” (I was 5’2 and weighed 115 pounds). When I got a B I could have done better and gotten an A. I was severely depressed and anxious as a teenager and he put me down for it. “Are you fucking serious you can’t even order at McDonald’s? You’re that scared of human interaction?” “You’ve been laying around all day are you really that lazy? Go do something and get off your ass.” When I tried to kill my self he came to the hospital and the first thing he said was asking if I did it for attention. 

As for my mother, she was plain crazy at one point after the divorce. She gave me no space. She followed me around the house and got mad when I wanted to be left alone. We would get in arguments to the point where I was sobbing and so angry I was screaming at the top of my lungs and I kept saying I need to be alone I can’t take this and she wouldn’t leave, she chased me around the house and kept yelling at me, then called me childish and immature for my emotional reactions when I told her I need to calm down but she wouldn’t let me. 

She went through my phone all the time. She would come into my room to talk to me and when I didn’t feel like talking she said I don’t love her anymore. She used to physically fight me. Not hitting in punching but when I tried to get away from her while we were arguing because I wanted time to calm down she physically restrained me to the point where I was screaming and hitting her saying let me go I can’t take this anymore, she would smack me back and not let me go, even take me to the ground. 

She once called me emotionally abusive, I was only 17. I admit i was very mean to her, I just couldn’t stand her anymore. I resented her and her presence alone made me furious. She refused to apologize for anything, ever. When I tried to express my feelings she ignored it and ended the conversation because she’s the parent and she’s always right. I was never heard. 

I used to cut myself and when she found out she punished me by taking away my phone, computer, and grounded me from seeing my friends. 

I was never called stupid or anything like that, i wasn’t neglected, they were encouraging of my goals and wanted me to succeed. I think they both genuinely thought they were doing the right thing, but the more I grow up the more I realize I would never do that to my children. 

Is this emotionally abusive or just parents who didn’t know what they were doing?",thisis-myusername97,2019-04-29 21:16:59,1,815,12.5,44.15,68.7,1,19.88,13.5,95.95,64.29,26.38,21.96,13.01,0.61,1.1,5.77,1.47,4.42,3.44,12.88,10.06,5.4,8.71,2.82,21.96,3.56,1.47,2.33,1.23,1.47,7.48,1.35,6.13,0.74,2.7,0.98,16.32,1.6,0.49,3.93,2.7,11.41,1.6,2.58,2.82,1.23,1.1,3.19,2.58,0.25,1.84,0.49,2.94,0.74,0.86,0.12,1.35,7.73,2.33,1.23,1.84,2.82,0.12,11.41,6.38,0.25,14.72,2.58,6.99,5.15,0.37,1.35,0.49,0.12,0,0.12,0.74,0.49,0.25,0,0,0,12.27,4.42,2.58,0,0.12,0.49,0,0.37,1.23,2.82,0.25,0

bj4a1b,Sexual assault?,"Hey, I haven't been very active here recently but something happened Thursday and i have clue how to feel or what to do about it. Im so upset and angry at myself for allowing it to happen.   
Im pretty sure what happened counts as sexual assult?  


I got a lift back with a guy i have training with and in the car park he started to put their hands down my jeans. I told him no and to stop and let go but he didnt and kept going. I must have said to stop about 7 times. I then tried to pull his hand off me but he was too strong and i couldn't. Eventually, he stopped and said sorry. I nearly got out the car then but i had no other way home and i didnt think he would try anything else but he did. 

During the drive home, he kept touching me in inappropriate places and trying to get his hand up my hoodie. Then when i got out the car he got out and pulled me into a hug and put his hand down the back of my jeans. I shouted at him and went home quite scared from what happened.   


I really dont know what i should do now. At the start i wasnt as upset by it but now i have had some time to think about it i feel really bad about it and keep thinking of things i should of did differently. I should have gotten out the car and called for a lift from someone else or i should have told him no more forcefully and made him stop but i almost gave up saying no and froze. 

Im too scared to tell my parents about it or to go to the police so i dont really know what other options i would have other than forget about it and try to move on. I have a bruise on my leg from where he was squeezing me really hard.  


He called me in tears saying how sorry he was but i dont believe him. I think he is scared about what is going to happen and upset because his girlfriend found out and he is scared he will lose her. I dont want to have to see him again but i am going to have to because i have training with him a couple times a week.

bjad66,Was this abuse and should I leave?,"Hey, all,

Reposting from relationship advice sub. I am a 35f here with a partner, 34m, since 2007. Using a throwaway account for this question. I'll try to keep this story from being too lengthy but there will be a tldr at the end, just in case. I'm also on mobile, so please forgive any formatting errors.

So, in 2015, I developed health issues that drastically changed my life. I had to quit my job and seek treatment. Just a side note, I have since physically and mentally healed over the years and am doing better. Initially, however, the illness and pain I experienced triggered within me a severe depression and thoughts of suicide. I expressed this to my partner and told him that I wanted to die and asked if he would help me end my life. Now, in retrospect, I know how this sounds, but my thinking was obviously not clear.

Upon telling him this, (note: he has never done this before or since) he grabbed my throat and I forced him away from me. I went home and cried, traumatized, as I have been abused in my past relationships, which he knew. I did not see him for years following this, but he told me that his intention was never to hurt me. He claimed that he was trying to snap me out of it and make me recognize that I didn't want to die.

As stupid as it sounds, after a long span of not speaking, we began to talk on the phone. I told him I still don't trust him and panic at the thought of seeing him. He has since moved on, into a polyamorous relationship with a girl. He told her about me and that she must accept me if he is to be in her life. So, he wants me to ultimately be a part of their relationship. I honestly don't see this happening, for obvious reasons. She also doesn't know the real reason behind why I maintain a distance from him.

I know, overall, that this is something I have control over, in the sense that I have chosen to reconnect with him. I told him that I am resentful for many reasons, one of them being that his girlfriend feels safe with him. He would never do to her what was done to me because he is too afraid of losing her. She, too has had health issues and been previously abused and he seems to feel sorry for her in a way that he never did with me. He tells me he perceives me as tougher than her.

Overall, I am tired of keeping myself in limbo. When I think of this situation or speak with him, all I feel is angry and bitter. When I take space, those feelings dissolve and there is some peace. The answer seems obvious, but what do you guys think? Was this abuse? Should I fully cut off interaction? Thank you so much in advance for your thoughts and insight.

Tldr: Isolated incident of partner grabbing my neck when I told him I felt suicidal and wanted to die. We took space but reconnected. He moved onto a new and polyamorous relationship that he wants me to be part of. I have not seen him, am terrified to and cannot trust him the same. Was this abuse and should I remove myself from his life?",Looking4closure987,2019-04-30 16:36:09,1,579,21.23,52.07,38.01,5.5,14.48,13.47,94.13,63.04,24.87,19.34,10.19,0.35,0.52,7.94,0.35,5.53,3.8,13.99,9.67,5.01,8.12,2.25,20.03,3.45,1.73,1.38,0.52,1.38,5.7,1.9,3.8,0.52,1.55,1.04,15.03,0,0.86,1.73,6.56,15.03,4.84,2.94,2.25,2.42,1.9,2.94,3.97,0.86,0.86,1.55,2.42,0.35,1.9,0,0.17,4.84,2.25,1.04,0.86,0.69,0.69,6.56,10.19,0.69,11.4,1.38,5.53,4.49,0.35,0.17,0.17,0.17,0,0.86,0.52,0,0.35,0,0,0,14.51,6.04,5.87,0.35,0,0.86,0,0,0,1.04,0.35,0

eovte7,Can you help me to figure out why all this happened ?,"I want to figure out what type of person my father is and why he did what he did. What fueled his rage? 
I think being able to put a label on him might help me understand and give me some sort of explanation why my family had to suffer so much.
Maybe you can help me. 

I’ll try to keep it short.

One of my earliest memories is my father beating and yelling at my mother, the police being called, him trying to run and after a few days in jail my mom brought him back. 
He was a teacher, very strict, liked to withdraw love and manipulate my sister and I to turn against each other by setting us up for failure and getting us to tell on each other. 
Four year old me didn’t like to eat fish but I was forced, So I came up with the idea to stuff all of what was left in my mouth, ask to go to the toilet and spit it out. Well he found out and I was given the choice between the belt and walking barefoot in the snow while my mother and he watched until he deemed I had gotten my deserved punishment. 
The cold seems to be one of his favorite methods of punishment. He locked my mother on the balcony in winter and had her sleep outside. Once on Christmas years later he threw her out again and didn’t let us have the little books she brought us as gifts. To this day this is the event that breaks my heart the most. 
My mother was very vulnerable, she was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder years ago but I don’t know what kind of symptoms she had back then. 

My father used to have riding crops on the wall in his office but I don’t remember being hit with them, though I know for certain he didn’t ride horses. When I was around 4 my mom was away sometimes and I was alone with him. When I didn’t eat properly one day, he cut off all of my long hair while I was whaling. 
After my mom, sister and I had gone on vacation without him because he had changed his mind and tried to mess with our car to prevent us from leaving, we came back to changed locks and where forced to live with neighbors until we lived in a women’s shelter. After some time he somehow convinced my mother to come back though and hell continued. 
He also convinced a social worker, that came into our house and asked us kids questions, to tell on us or she was just completely incompetent. 
When I was 3 my sister and I were left with my fathers mother for half a year because of something with my mother and that’s when I learned where he got all this from. 
My grandmother didn’t let my sister have her crutches when she injured her foot, didn’t let her face the table during meals if she had a wrong look on her face and locked me (3 y old) in the dark bathroom on a barstool that I was too small and too afraid to get off on my own. 

So yeah what do you think. Why did this happen? What fueled his rage ? Could this be narcissism? 
I just want answers.

(My foster mother thinks he is a narcissist because he openly stated he doesn’t care if he makes me feel hurt during a phone call. doesn’t seem affected by any of his actions and still likes to exert power over us by withholding pictures and so on. He does seem to have a fragile ego as well.)",imgdtwaim,2020-01-14 18:20:45,0,631,32.62,67.13,68.73,11.43,20.35,11.73,93.03,60.54,21.24,17.59,8.4,1.9,0.48,6.66,0.16,3.65,3.96,15.06,9.19,5.71,8.4,1.74,19.33,2.69,1.27,2.85,1.43,1.9,3.96,1.43,2.54,0.32,0.95,0.63,15.21,3.33,0.16,4.6,5.39,12.52,3.8,2.38,0.79,3.17,0.95,2.85,1.58,0.63,0.32,0.63,2.54,1.27,0.79,0,0.48,8.08,3.65,1.11,3.33,0.63,0.48,9.03,8.08,0.48,16.32,3.17,7.45,6.34,1.11,0.63,0.79,0,0.32,0,0.63,0.16,0,0.16,0.32,0,9.98,4.12,2.22,0,0,0.79,0,0,0,2.22,0.63,0
eox9ei,"He strangled me several times, peed on me, and poured alcohol on me.","I am 21. Me and my (now ex) 28 boyfriend moved in together as couple in December. He is a pro heavy weight fighter. And I’m really small for my age. Things were going good we were in love. I had dinner at his family house for thanksgiving and he went to mine for Christmas. This was a big thing for me I was hesitant to introduce him because to me it had to be serious. He said we are. I finally did but I noticed he used to verbally abuse. He called me a bitch, and told me I’m stupid etc. I told him please stop, but he always called me soft. And eventually would apologize. I thought this as a normal thing. Things escalated a few days ago I found messages with him and another women. He pleaded with me and I wanted to get back with him but he just wouldn’t tell me the whole truth. He took his gun out and said if you want to end it then go ahead, and gave it to me to shoot him. I said please stop you are scaring me let's have a serious discussion. He wouldn't stop and pointed the gun at his head. He eventually put it away. Eventually this dialed down but I was still hurt wanting answers. Hes my first love first kiss first everything &amp; I admit I did push him several times and started hitting him. He dodged everything and didn’t flinch. After that he slapped the shit out of me. I saw white and get knocked out. He did this several times and yes with excessive force and I’m a really tiny girls After,  I told him I was leaving to go on a date he tackled me and put me in a chokehold. He did this several times each time more and more scary. I thought I was about to die when he was choking me. But I blame myself. I was high on my emotions in shock and I wanted his passcode. He wouldn’t give it to me and tried to blame me because I looked through his phone. I always pretend my life is perfect so I didn’t want this to be the case. The day after that I didn’t talk to him we broke up but he was talking to me like he wanted to still be with me. He apologized and said he would always love me and that he hopes I can find some way to forgive him. Today I talked to a guy on a dating app about meeting up and he was in bed next to me. He slapped the  phone out of my hand and grabbed my wrist and hung up the phone. He said I’m not shit. But he said we are done 1000 times. I ended up finding the girls number and confronted her, she ended up being a prostitute. When he got home I confronted him. He pushed me and called me a stupid bitch. I spit in his face. He spit in mine. Several times this went on for an hour. Eventually he got his penis out and started peeing on me. He said i am his and that he's marking his territory. I pulled his hair he tackled me and started strangling me. I really thought this was the end. Like wow i’m going to die like this. He stopped only when I scream with whatever breath I have left or pushed him off of me. I really thought I was gonna die.  He did this several times. I think im in denial. I didn't think I would be a victim of domestic violence. He has said many times he would never hit a women. I'm too scared to tell anyone. We have a roommate and I told him we broke up and im thinking of telling him about this but I feel like he likes my ex more than me. I can't tell anyone right now.  I'm worried he's strangled me so many times should I go to the doctor. Hes already threatened me that if I call the cops his family would come after me.",livingintheend98,2020-01-14 20:16:12,10,712,16.31,57.25,65.03,4.45,11.87,12.22,94.94,62.64,29.21,24.86,13.76,0.98,0.28,9.83,0,4.35,3.93,12.22,8.99,3.79,7.44,1.4,20.79,3.93,1.97,0.56,0.84,2.39,5.9,1.83,3.93,0.84,1.83,0.42,19.38,0.28,0.56,0.84,9.83,9.83,2.25,0.56,2.53,1.12,1.12,3.09,3.09,0.42,1.69,0.98,2.95,1.4,0.7,0.28,0.42,7.72,2.53,0.7,2.81,0.98,0.84,9.55,8.15,1.26,16.57,2.39,6.04,8.29,0.28,0.42,0.98,0,0.14,0.42,1.26,0.56,0.28,0.14,0,0,12.5,8.43,0.98,0,0.14,0,0,0,0,2.53,0.28,0.14

eoycig,Need advice with having to deal with abuser...,"In high school, I was constantly abused both mentally and physically by my boyfriend. I still have not fully recovered. I recently was admitted into my college's Disabled Students Services Program due to PTSD surrounding these incidents. I have had 0 contact with my abuser since graduating high school. 

However, I live in a small town, and I see him often walking my campus and out in town. It stresses me out and makes me panicky. I figure this is normal. 

This semester I found out that he is in a college class I have. I have spoken with the school as to what could be done about it. Basically nothing and that I have to stay in the class with him in order to graduate. 

This class is on Friday and I'm losing lots of sleep with having to hear his voice and see him interact with other people that have no idea the horrors he did to me during high school. 

Does anyone have any advice about this? I'm just a little lost.

eoyf1j,Trauma,"I left my ex 9 months ago and I’ve been suffering ever since.

We were together for just over two years, during that time I was verbally abused and berated on a daily basis, sexually assaulted and raped, some of which he would record. 

When I finally had the strength to leave, I did it all on a whim. I’d just come home from work and he was shouting the usual abuse at me, being generally nasty and telling me how stupid and worthless I was, at that point I snapped. I thought, ‘I’m going to kill myself or him or him then myself’, and I ran into our bedroom and started throwing everything into my suitcase. We’d actually moved quite recently so luckily a lot of my stuff was already packed.

I had 5% battery on my phone, I booked an Uber. The whole time he’s telling me I’m a whore, throwing things at me and screaming. Stamping around to intimidate me, but I kept my head down and kept packing. 3% battery now, and the Uber is almost here. My heart was racing and I was shaking so much I could barely zip the case up, I dragged it to the door, basically threw myself into the taxi and never looked back. Of course I got a barrage of abuse for weeks, I blocked him about 6 times on various social media accounts. 

I thought once I left I’d be okay. But I am really not okay. Everything scares me. Men scare me. And in the dead of night when I’m alone I see his face, I hear his voice, I feel his hands. I think about all of the disgusting things I tolerated and I disgust myself, I feel sullied and defeated and unworthy of anything positive. 

My insomnia has been horrendous as of late, and it gets worse every night. I’m so stressed I can barely think straight, and I’m so exhausted I can barely tell what day it is. I hate him so much, I wish he was dead. I wish I could be the one to do it, part of me wishes I had done it but what would have been the point. 20 to life for a scumbag that certainly *would* piss on me if I was on fire, so he could tell people he was a hero, not to actually help me. 

I literally just realised that I need counselling, I need to talk to women and hear the stories of women who have been through what I’ve been through, or are currently experiencing what I went through. I need to know I’m not being irrational, I’m not imagining it and maybe one day it will get better. I want to love myself and feel valued as a woman, and I don’t want intrusive memories of the abuse taking over my life. 

Then I remembered that I use Reddit, and on here there’s a sub for everything, so I searched and lo and behold here it was, exactly what I needed. If you got this far thanks for reading, I hate that we have to be here but at least we’re here together.",messygirl1993,2020-01-14 22:04:20,9,532,11.73,15.5,83.65,1,18.34,14.1,92.86,62.22,24.25,18.61,15.04,0.94,0.19,2.44,0,5.64,4.32,10.9,11.09,7.14,9.21,1.13,20.3,3.01,1.32,1.88,1.69,2.07,7.52,2.07,5.45,0.94,2.44,0.56,8.27,0,0,0.56,2.63,12.78,2.07,0.75,3.2,3.01,2.07,3.01,2.82,0.56,1.13,0.94,2.44,0.94,0.75,0.56,0,5.26,1.88,0.56,1.88,1.32,0.19,7.14,10.71,1.32,12.41,1.32,5.64,5.64,0.75,0.38,0.56,0.19,0,0.56,1.13,0.38,0.19,0.38,0,0,15.41,5.26,6.02,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,3.2,0,0.75

ep4983,Just got out of an abusive relationship &amp; still struggling to make sense of it all.,"I never really got the chance to talk out what happened so I thought I’d just get it all out here. I’m a 19 year old girl and the guy that I was dealing with was 22.  I met him on Facebook messenger after he messaged me and he genuinely seemed like a nice guy.  

After us talking for a few days he brought up the subject of possibility meeting up and I agreed. As we talked about meeting up, I found it weird that he wanted to meet at his house after dark but I didn’t say anything because I genuinely wanted to meet him and I would need to sneak out to do it because I still live with my mother and she’s really protective of me because of my mental health issues. I met up with him and and everything was fine but it seems like shortly after our meet up I noticed that he would start to say things like 

“Why are you acting so stupid?” 

“Why are you still up?, you better be at home.”

But at the time I overlooked those red flags thinking that he liked me and just was just being possessive.  Another red flag that I missed was him wanting to move the relationship much faster than a normal relationship. He started telling me that he loved me and I would voice that I was uncomfortable with him saying that so early in the relationship ( I don’t really remember how he responded to that). 

Even with all of that, I still fell in love with him and soon I was spending every other night at his home. While I was there, I began to notice how him and his family drank every night. I tried to get him to stop but he refused. One night I was staying over and I decided that I would take a nap when I got there and I woke up at like 2 in the morning  and I remember that I got up to use the restroom and he called me into the kitchen after and he was drinking a y’all can of Green apple fourl loko and he seemed normal. He made me something to eat and we smoked(marijuana) together and I said that I wanted to go back into his room. When we got into his room he turned on the tv and he was still drinking the four loko. 

Something on the tv make me laugh and all of a sudden he started being mean to me, asking me why I was laughing at that( the joke) and I said it was because I thought it was funny and he just dropped it. Once the show went off, he started searching for something else and I asked if we could watch Problem Child and that’s when he really started being mean to me so I just turned over and looked for something to to watch on YouTube as I often did and that’s when he came and towered over me( I was laying down and he was standing ) and he started asking me why I was on my phone and I told him that it was because I can and he was like”what?”( I guess to intimidate me) and when I said it again he punched me really hard and really fast too. 

I almost didn’t even know what happened. My nose was bleeding a little and I jumped up immediately and started crying and begging him to just let me go home and it was like he didn’t care that I was crying at all.  He said “ I really don’t wanna hot you again, lay down.” And I did but after a few minutes, I sat up and with my legs dangling off the bed  with my hand covering my face and he said to me

“ why the the fuck are you sitting there looking stupid, lay your ass down.” 

I was so scared. I just did what he said.

ep5jpv,GF (F22) physically abusive to me (M23),"We’ve been together close to 2 years it’s been a lot of ups and down and we broke up for a while last year cause it got Super toxic, we go back together a couple weeks later after both of us were dating other people but decided we still wanted to be together. Before the break up there were times where she was physically abusive, one notable time was throwing a cone of ice cream on me in public cause I acted like I wiped my nose on her jumper cause she always wipes her hands on mine, which I don’t really care. I didn’t really think it was a big problem. 

Fast forward to now where I’ve moved to a new city to continue my degree and she’s been studying here since last year. I stayed with her for two weeks as my apartment wasn’t ready to for me to move it yet. Pretty much Everyday she would have mood swings and if I did something like closing the blinds as I prefer dark over light she would start punching my chest or arms or trying to slap me. I would never retaliate and would just laugh it off and leave her alone. 

While staying with her I started to realise there is no way her and I have a future together as I definitely can’t stay with someone like her. She suffers from depression and likes to keep things to herself, as someone who suffers from depression for the past two years I’ve since started treatment for it and have never felt better mentally, I keep urging her to seek help but she’ll always brush it off. I always feel her negativity would bring me down mentally which I feel guilty as she’s been there when I was fighting my demons (even though a lot of it was caused by her)

A couple days ago I went over to her place and she kept on saying don’t go into her room and mess it up. For some context the first time I came to visit her I didn’t really help her clean up her place which is on me, since then I’ve been helping out with the house chores. I’m also a pretty goofy guy and I like to poke fun at people and have a laugh. So I went to lie on her bed and she just exploded. Started screaming which she normally did if I pissed her off, she then started to constantly hit me. I almost fought back but controlled myself, I got my stuff and left. 

The next day she was trying to contact me and I told her off and said I’m fed up of the abuse as I always told her her physically abusing is a problem she’ll always be sorry about it but it’ll happen again. She said I didn’t do anything that night but because I have a track record of messing her place up she got angry??? When I was staying with her she would get pissed off at me over the smallest things, on New Years we went to a club which she got denied entry and started crying, went home started to fight me. She has a history of randomly crying while drinking at the club. 

Anyways I told her to stay away from me, she came down my apartment last night to pass my stuff, I just took it and said bye. I needed some info about something as I’m new to this city so I asked her which she said she’ll help me for now but that me and her should stop talking after and I said ok. 

What should I do now, I’ve been wanting to leave her as I don’t feel that same spark with her like I did at the start and our relationship has gotten pretty stale. But the only thing keeping me still with her is she’s the only person I know in the city and I’ve haven’t properly settled in yet, haven’t started Uni yet where I could meet and befriend plenty of people. Another thing is she’s great at portraying herself as an angel to the public but she has a whole different side to her when she’s with me. She’s actually a nice girl and has done a lot for me, but there’s so many ups and downs and I also want to keep my mental health in a good space, as I hit a Low in my mental health right before our breakup. Any advice is greatly appreciated and sorry for the Long text.",canyoudigthat,2020-01-15 09:46:58,3,775,26.65,48.45,77.58,12.18,28.7,10.32,94.58,62.32,23.23,18.32,9.81,1.03,0,7.48,0,4.9,4.65,15.1,9.94,5.94,8.52,1.81,20.39,4.65,2.97,1.81,0.65,1.81,6.06,2.45,3.48,0.13,1.29,1.42,13.94,0,0.39,7.74,0.13,11.48,1.29,1.16,2.45,2.84,1.16,3.48,2.45,0.39,1.16,0.77,2.06,0.77,0.9,0,0.39,7.23,2.84,0.65,2.58,1.29,0.39,8.52,9.42,0.9,20.9,3.1,9.03,9.94,0.26,0.52,0.9,0,0.26,0,0.65,0.26,0.13,0.13,0,0.13,10.45,3.23,2.06,0,0,0.39,0,0,0,4,0.77,0

epdg0a,"Neighbor suspecting abuse, what proof do i need?","Please let me know if there is a better subreddit

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone,

I just moved into a new apartment and the first month was fine, but in the past 2 weeks I am beginning to suspect the neighbor below me  is abusive. The first time it was a screaming match between two guys for what seemed like 5 minutes. Im unsure how long it actually occurred because it was as I was walking back into my apartment. I heard them pushing (definitely knocked over something), but i didnt hear any actual hits. By the time I got out my phone to call someone, the fight was over.

Just now I heard another altercation. The same man from the previous time screaming ""stop calling me a thief"" ""shit the fu$k up"" etc... Right before it stopped, i could hear the guy yell to sit down, then i a wife/gf say calm down... then heard the guy again and a push or something. This was only about a minute or 2.

Ive been hoping to catch the woman on her way out since the first occurrence, but I havent been lucky. I want to ask if everything is ok before I call the police (if this happens again.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Just wondering if anyone here can share a good approach to how to handle this. I am going to notify the landlord and I have the Sheriff number in my contacts if it escalates again. Im concerned Ill call, it will subside by the time they get here, and it might get worse for the family.

eptwd2,do you ever feel irrational guilt,"for blowing your abuse off. 

my partner and I are very hot and cold. and I find myself feeling irrationally guilty for the abuse happening to me. like for example, we were arguing the other day, he insulted my mental health and my looks, and I fired back saying that his d*ck is small and that's why he can't act right. it was unnecessary that I fire back, but I was hurt and angry. he constantly makes me feel ashamed of my body physically, so I did the same. he punched me in the face. definitely not the first time. 

but the thing is. I am fully aware that yeah I shouldn't fire back, but that no matter what I said he shouldn't physically touch me. but I ALWAYS after these situations feel guilt as though if I didn't say something he wouldn't do it. even though he would have found a reason to hit me if I was sitting there quietly AGREEING with his statements about me. 

I don't know if it's the empathy that I so freely and unfortunately give him. but this is something that I always struggle with. and something that I always think about when I am trying to leave.",lydmannn,2020-01-16 18:24:07,4,212,1.8,10.15,83.68,1,13.25,14.15,95.75,66.04,28.3,19.34,13.21,0.47,0.94,4.72,0,8.96,3.77,7.55,10.38,8.49,10.85,3.77,19.34,4.25,1.89,1.42,0.47,0,8.49,1.42,7.08,3.3,2.36,0.47,9.43,0,0.47,0,4.72,18.87,5.19,1.42,3.3,3.3,2.36,6.6,7.08,0.47,1.89,4.72,2.36,0.94,1.42,0,0,3.77,1.42,0.94,1.42,0,0,3.77,11.32,0,9.91,0.47,4.25,6.6,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0.47,0,0,0.47,0,0,14.15,7.08,2.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.77,0,0.47

epwq1x,My domestic violence story.,"I wrote this from a third person perspective. Still coming to terms with what happened in my life so far. Hoping saying everything out loud (or typing it) helps somehow. 

if anyone reads this please know i dont usually type this way, I just had to spit it all out.

She was an 18 year old female with big dreams. Graduating high school. Good grades. But distant family. Joins a bad crowd of kids. 23 year old thug sweeps her off her feet. Showing her off. Taking her places. Rapping to her in front of everyone in the streets. Everyone loves him. But he is very manipulative. She doesnt see he is a narcisist. 

 She gets drunk one night. He has sex with her passed out. She turns up pregnant. She stays with him because she loves him. He wants to get married. He alienates her from her family and friends. They move away from hometown. He starts becoming violent while shes pregnant. Purposefully dangerous driving. Slamming her on the bed, etc. 

 She has no where to go. Cant work because of pregnancy. Family was strict and cut her out when she fell pregnant. He steals all her money and she has nothing but his roof over her head. Girl is in pain and gets helicoptered to hospital. Baby comes 3 months early via emergency c section. Doctors dont know why, she never smoke and was taking care. But she knows the constant heartbreak had something to do with it.


 Daughter is in hospital for 3 months.  Mom gets infection and is in and out of hospital. Baby and mom get out of hospital and live with him again. Mom gets abused regularly. He convinces neighbors the screaming is just sex noises. He cheats on her with 16 year old neighbor. When she finds out he attacks violently, in front of the baby. She protects baby under the crib surrounded by pillows while he hurts mom. Smashing her cell phone when she tries to call 911. Kicking and punching. Choking. He goes away to throw things. 

She puts phone back together and calls 911. Police come and he runs away hiding downtown. He goes to court and only has a small fine to pay. She is homeless with baby and sleeps in a living room with a crib. 

She starts to get her own place. She has ptsd. He knocked up the 16 year old and has a kid with her. He moves in with 16 year old. 

 She is alone with a 4 year old and is not okay. He messages her manipulating messages 4 years later. First he begs her to come back. Then again, saying hes not the father, even though he is on the birth certificate and she was never with anyone else. She wishes he wasnt the father. She lives alone and in fear he will reappear and take her daughter. Somedays he asks to have custody. She has panic attacks. She cant afford lawyers. The judges dont believe her, or dont care. They dont see hes a narcisist. The rest is still unwritten.",throwawayimsorrie,2020-01-16 22:36:51,1,523,45.94,95.9,3.78,6.56,7.81,14.72,92.16,53.54,18.16,15.49,0.96,0,0,14.15,0.38,2.68,4.21,13,7.27,4.4,6.88,2.87,17.59,2.49,0.19,1.15,2.68,0.57,5.54,1.91,3.63,0.38,1.15,0.76,23.9,4.02,0.57,9.94,5.93,8.41,1.53,1.15,0.76,1.72,1.53,2.68,2.29,0.57,1.34,0.38,4.97,0.76,3.06,1.15,0.38,10.13,2.68,0.96,3.44,2.29,0.76,2.1,13.96,1.15,20.08,3.25,9.94,7.46,2.1,0.96,1.91,0.38,0,0,0.19,0,0,0.19,0,0,14.53,12.81,1.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.38,0

eqdj0a,Any Advice for Recovery? (beware really grafic stuff),"About a year ago I was stuck and my now ex-boyfriend managed to manipulate me into moving states to be with him while he was living with his grandmother, Who we will call A, and his grandfather, who we will call S. He was 17 about to be 18 and I had already moved out to be on my own at 20. Just before I moved I started having seizures at random times and collapsing so to say my health wasn't very good. I moved there and for about a week everything was ok. Then the grandmother started in on me for a few of my disabilities. I have many disabilities to the point it's kinda unbelievable that there are so many of them. Anyway.

So it started when I was forced to live in a motel room after the people who were assigned caretakers basically abandoned me. I am autistic as well as hypoglycemic and these people left me without any way to eat food and absolutely no budget to get the food. The ex, whom we will call J, begged and begged his grandmother for weeks to let me move there to the point he literally called her at work and screamed at her till she said yes. I constantly said ""don't push if you can't get me there I'll go back to my home state"" but he said he would KILL HIMSELF if I didn't move there. He reminded me of another abusive situation I was in back in my hometown preying on things I told him in confidence and trust knowing how afraid I was of this other person. So I stupidly agreed and came there with my 3 ESA's.

2 weeks after I moved there the room of which i was given and paid rent for was still not habitable so I ended up sleeping in my boyfriend's room a couple times and it became regular as they didn't want to clean the room and kept saying ""i'll do it tomorrow."" I am very non-confrontational so I tend to just hide and back away and just accept stuff. Another week passes and I've started paying for meals for the grandson, whom A and S had legal custody over because of his mother abandoning him. I mention this and A just yells at me ""We have fucking food in the kitchen! use it!"" Well all they had in the kitchen was stuff i wasn't allowed to touch because it was for dinner. To be blunt all they had was ramen, of which my stomach is super super sensitive to something in it to the point of food poisoning like symptoms. I payed 300$ a month for a room with no screens on the window and no way to safely cool down the room and this was in the beginning of summer, 80 degrees F minimum during the day with a always sun facing window with no shades. So I shut up and take it using my credit card to pay for food.

About a month and a half in A starts screaming at me after dinner one night, she made stew with a super heavy meat in it, Of which I got the same stuff as with ramen. I mention this and tell her ""i'm sorry but heavy meats really upset my stomach and make me sick."" at this point. i should probably mention J had started hiding my birth control, and i was pregnant. She gives me a death glare and a silent treatment to the point i just go back to my room and mention to J how odd she was acting. It was my friend's birthday, she was like a little sister to me, and i was in a conference phone call with her and my now boyfriend. She comes and starts screaming at me grabbing my laptop and slamming it to the ground. Out of fear i run out of the house crying and down to a nearby stream. I'm crying and wanting to jump into the rapids because i couldn't handle doing this anymore as this is just the most extreme out of all of them. J calls my parents on my phone and they tell me to call the police. We go back to be able to call the police and my head starts spinning, next thing i know i'm on the ground with my head hurting like hell, which is a sign of a seizure a minimal one, J is now calling 911 as i had hit my head and was having real trouble breathing, we make our way up the hill slowly to the point an ambulance can see me, I have 15 more seizures on the way up resulting in a grand mal seizure right before the ambulance get's there. We were right near the field for the school in the town so the coach who was having a practice came running down and it took 2 grown men to get me to the ambulance. J takes my phone from me and goes running to A and talks with the sheriff. My seizures when they are mild i can semi-hear things around me and feel my body convulsing. After the first seizure the 14 others after that J never speaks one word to the 911 operator about them. J purposefully waits till his grandmother get's there to say i was having them. After that I am taken alone by ambulance to the hospital in the city 45 minutes away. I sit in the waiting room for 2 HOURS waiting for him. And he comes in begging for me to allow his grandmother to talk to me of which i start screaming in fear and she is forced to leave. He keeps berating me on how it was a ""misunderstanding"" when i had told A that heavy meats make me sick. He continues to lie to my parents who called on facebook to see if i was ok. A then leaves me and her minor grandson without a vehicle with 15$ to get home. It costs at minimum 35$ one way. So i use my credit card afraid of her abusing my cats as she had already STABBED ONE IN THE LEG because she allowed her cat to come out and get woohoo time with mine. I later find out from my now boyfriend he called him and my friend saying what happened with absolutely no emotion in his voice other than pride that this had happened. I miscarried the first time with this.

:if you are afraid of extreme violence skip this entire paragraph:

So i was intimate with J. I also have a D.I.D. which results in multiple personality. One of my personalities, Rosetta, has a kink of choking. Rosetta and J talk out before starting that any tapping means stop right then and there. So they get to it. J is giving Rosetta her kink but he decides to let all lust take over and Rosetta start's tapping. No letting go. Rosetta starts to lose consciousness and is now struggling. He keeps at it. Everything goes dark. Rosetta wakes up after being cream-pied, in term, and starts coughing finding out that he choked her till near death, almost Killing me in the process. Before anyone says i should go to the police about this one. I have. They literally told me to ""fuck off it's your own fault"" word for word.

&amp;#x200B;

3 months in J get's admitted to the psychiatric hospital because he hasn't been taking any of his medications and is hallucinating. I am left 3 days alone with A and S. S comes in and tells me it's my fault that J hasn't been taking his medications and that he was admitted. This is after A threatens me in the waiting room of which i was waiting because i had had another seizure and was trying to get help. I run out of fear and call the police who say they can't do anything because they don't want to check the security camera's even though she came a few cm from striking me. This is were my hypoglycemia comes hugely in. A starts calling in ""sick"" to work and barricading me in at the hallway so i can't leave the house or go and get food. I started at this point taking my laptop with the camera on in a discord call and everyone in can see me physically shaking anytime i go near A or S. i go 3 days without food or water as the water from the faucets were so iron heavy it could kill you if you drank it to stay hydrated. Day after J is hospitalized i go to the hospital by ambulance for chest pains. i leave my laptop recording video and the window closed with all 3 days inside, i should add now my 3 cats were all registered ESA's, service animals, and 1 of them is declawed in the front and A knew this. I come home 3 hours later to find the window open. I go and check the camera and it shows A going into my room and opening the window. This area had BEARS within the last few days. and MOUNTAIN LIONS of which had attacked the one who didn't have the stabbing happen and broke 2 of her ribs. I just freak out and make run outside crying trying to get my babies back inside safe. The next day i call 911 because A is pounding on my locked door saying i have to get out NOW and that i didn't pay her rent of which my bank statements say otherwise and her signing and lowering my rent to provide food for J was done (she stole this by the way and shredded it). I am told by police i have 24 hours to leave. I hadn't eaten anything for over 48 hours at this point and was starving and dehydrated. That night i am forced to use a small flight credit i have to run back to the my hometown of Colorado Springs. I ask the neighbor if she'd watch my 2 youngest while i arranged passage for them and that i would contact her after i recovered a bit. I get a call 2 days into recovery of which i was just sleeping and exhausted from saying they have my cat's they STOLE MY CATS and were not going to give them back. Later that day i start bleeding, and not that time of the month bleeding, i had my second miscarriage.

Here is were i should put a little about myself. My birth mother was a meth addict and had me taken away by the state of which i was put with my biological great aunt and uncle who are my mom and dad. My dad signed his rights away at birth knowing he couldn't provide. At 7 years old my mom passed away and i found out i had 2 half sibling who were younger. My grandmother, my mom's youngest sister and my birth mom's mother, died 2 years later of pancreatic cancer after running from her own domestic abuse. I got 1 thing from my birth mother, her violin, which i took everywere with me when i moved, and 1 thing from my grandmother, a jewelry box. 3 years after my grandmother died my adoptive dad's father died. I had a sewing basket handed down for years.

About 2 weeks after i ran i get a call from J saying he's out and how much he loves me and was glad i was safe. And how he was going to make sure i got my 2 kitties back and i'd get the items mentioned above back. I was staying with my younger half brother and his dad. My brother's dad had tried to tell me lies to turn me against my adoptive parents and i was so stressed about it that i accidentally took it out on J saying i don't want to talk. he took this as ""fuck you"". At this time i was relying on my current boyfriend who was acting like a brother to me and helping me through this. i was afraid to sleep or eat without being in a call with someone and A turned off J's wifi at night with no cell service. J took this as cheating (i was not with J for a month before i started dating again) and started threatening me of which i was forced to block and our mutual friend at the time who we will call H was communicating getting my stuff back. Then A sells my kitties and J goes and has my ex-friend who thought i was his gf (i was not) hack my computer and get nudes off of it ( i had them because i was checking myself for breast cancer and didn't have any mirrors!). My new boyfriend who we will call R from here on. Came out for my 21st flying from texas for 2 weeks. The day he was flying out J messages me with threats. I let it go. Then 2 hours before it turned my birthday he goes to R and tells him he's going to die and to kill himself by overdosing on insulin. R is type 1 diabetic and insulin dependant. He goes on saying how i am a whore and that i should go kill myself and how i deserved to miscarry those 2 times as my child would commit suicide as soon as they were in elementary because i am such a horrible person. I turn off my text notifications after this and calling my mom sobbing. My birthday we go up into the mountains and have fun and go out to eat at a nice restraunt and get icecream after the mountains. I go to text my mom thank you and that i had an amazing day. I have another bunch of text's from J, but this time he gave out my number to someone who had harrassed me before and was blocked on discord. I call the police having had enough of this and they reccomend an order of protection. And i ignore it having J know they were called. R goes back to texas for a few months.  J then uses H to harass me more as i have now changed my number. H isnt' at fault here. he is not good with recognising red flags at all and is an amazing friend. I try and commit suicide not seeing any other way to escape this and my dad takes me next day after R talks me down on phone like he actually had had to do in january of that year, it was august. And i get the temporary order for me and my 2 kitties, R had gotten me a kitty for my birthday at the humane society to try to help me recover. a day after, A SINGLE DAY AFTER HE IS SERVED THE ORDER. HE BREAKS IT. I call the police this and that. nothing is done. I go to court and montana decided, despite knowing the time limit on the case, to use snail mail to send the proof of service. So i have to go back again fearing i'd have to face him. J raped me almost daily for 3 months btw. I get the permanent and the sheriff up there serves him with it and that was in september. It is now January and he has hacked into my new computer, used that to harrass a 13 year old. He is now 18. They still have everything and about 5k worth of property which they legally stole from me and no one cares. He contacted me 5 days ago and the police didn't care again. I am actually scared for my safety as he is always voicing to those around him that he wants to murder me. I have severe PTSD after this.

All in all i am afraid to talk to people and am sceptical of even those i trust. I am afraid and now i am possibly pregnant with R, my actual now fiance's, child. I'm scared J will attack me in any way he can with the loopholes he found and cause enough stress for another miscairrage. He also somehow got my new number a week after it was changed. Anyone have any advice on this? Any advice to R as well?",LunaTamashi,2020-01-17 23:36:25,0,2780,51.69,43.85,78.96,9.43,19.31,12.88,89.86,58.53,19.96,14.57,9.89,0.43,0.25,3.13,0.86,5.4,5.5,15.32,7.99,4.24,7.52,1.47,17.45,4.1,2.19,1.51,2.23,1.44,4.17,1.4,2.73,0.76,0.97,0.47,11.22,1.55,0.5,1.76,2.91,6.94,0.86,1.62,0.83,1.44,0.9,1.87,1.8,0.36,1.04,0.36,3.27,0.65,1.51,0.36,0.9,6.37,1.44,0.86,1.98,1.62,0.76,6.58,9.35,0.76,17.16,2.84,7.34,7.45,1.33,0.32,1.01,0.61,0.04,0.5,1.08,0.22,0.4,0.25,0.11,0.04,10.11,5.04,1.55,0.07,0.07,0.11,0.11,0.18,0.58,1.87,0.36,0.18
eqeiqt,It's gotten worse,"I wrote recently [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/eoy9za/he_beat_me_again_and_im_over_it/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and I thought I'd share an update.

I found out today that on Monday, the person who had bailed my husband out of jail was a girl he met off a dating app, and he tried to make it seem like I was the psychotic one to them so the girl would go get him. He had sex with her and said he wanted to have a baby by her and forced her to delete the dating app they met on and then forced her to post a picture of him on her Facebook. Ridiculous. He said he wanted to impregnate her so bad, he came inside her. These are all her words. I'm not even shocked, because I found out he's been cheating with multiple women through his Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat accounts that I didn't even know existed. The girl didn't want to believe he was a married man and insisted that maybe I was lying but I showed her every message he's ever sent me and how he attempted to kill himself, plus videos and pictures on his gallery of him having sex with multiple other women while he lied about where he was to me.

She said it had been the first time they met, and it was because she bailed him out of jail.

This morning he tried to kill himself.

At one point while we were still living together, he went and changed my Snapchat password and put Snapchat as Spam mail on my Gmail, so I could never see if someone else logged in. Well, I woke up at 4am because my daughter was hungry, and to stay awake, I hopped on snap just to find that it was logged out. I tried my password and it kept saying it was wrong.

I reset it immediately and logged in, my husband had added himself and had screenshotted OLD conversations, conversations I had with people YEARS ago, WAYYYY before we were even married. Not only that, he saw a message I sent to a gay friend telling him my whereabouts and asking him to visit because I wanted to have someone to drink with and talk to.

So now began the accusations from his part -- he began to say I was having an affair and that I never loved him and that he knew where I was at (I have a protection order, and since I'm military, he's barred from post and I'm staying safely within base, but he was never supposed to know that).

He started telling me I never loved him and that he was going to kill himself. He started sending a lot of videos that I refused to open. So he saved them and sent them directly to me, he was downing a full bottle of sleeping pills.

I called the police for a welfare check and told them the videos were from MY bedroom.

They went, he refused to open the door, then they forced themselves in because they had clear evidence that he was trying to commit suicide based off the videos he sent me, and they took him to the ER.

He's now in the ICU and has been stable but not exactly conscious. I hate how they told me since I'm his spouse, I have to be the only one to call and ask for updates. I'm super pissed. I want it to be his brother or sister, I want nothing to do with him and want nothing from him, but since he's not conscious, he can't say otherwise and his family keeps contacting me asking for updates.

I fucking hate this guy. Would it be heartless or fucked up to say I wish I hadn't called the cops? That I wish he had died? I'm not sorry anymore, I went through hell this week just to find out he has cheated so many more times because of his suicide attempt. I fucking hate him! He's the father of my child and yet he beat me so many times because he didn't want me to find out or say someone else would treat me better.

I am void of emotion. I feel nothing.





Thanks to anyone who read this far. This was a way for me to vent, and to keep accountability of what has occurred.

He was finally served with my protective order paperwork and I can't wait for them to serve him the divorce paperwork, too. I can't wait to never see him again.",nanathebigsis,2020-01-18 01:46:23,8,782,20.76,76.31,17.3,7.83,20.58,13.43,93.61,61.51,24.81,19.95,8.57,0.26,0,9.46,1.66,4.86,3.96,12.92,8.82,4.73,8.31,2.56,21.23,2.05,0.9,0.9,0.51,1.28,4.22,1.28,2.81,0,2.17,0.13,21.61,1.53,0.26,2.3,8.82,12.02,1.92,2.43,1.92,1.66,1.92,2.94,2.56,1.41,1.02,0.13,1.92,0.26,0.38,0.77,0.38,8.57,3.96,1.41,2.05,0.77,0.77,10.23,9.34,0.64,13.3,2.05,5.12,5.88,0.77,1.66,0.51,0.26,0.13,0.77,2.05,0.64,1.15,0,0.26,0,15.86,4.99,3.96,0,0.13,0.38,0.13,0.26,0,2.69,0.51,2.81

eqln6y,"What can I do now, where can I go, I was abused and not she put in op, I some justice, I have nothing against them, I just want my kids","Personal Statement- Moha
 
I, Moha (the Respondent) hereby present before this honorable court the following statements in response to the allegations raised by the petitioner. I solemnly and sincerely affirm that all that I will present in this document shall be true to the best of my knowledge.
 
I and the Petitioner, sara  got married in 2014 through an arranged marriage between my family and her family. In 2015, I arrived in the United States of America (U.S.A) to settle with my wife. I moved into her family house with Seven (7) members of her family. I have lived peacefully and co-existed with the in-laws and my wife. I respect and love them as my own family. I don’t take the relationship with my in-laws for granted as they are my only family here in the U.S.A and the only people I know. This is especially true with the relationship I have with my father-in-law. I took him as a father since I lost my father in 2015. He has been the closest to a father I know.
 
It has been difficult for me in the last three years of my marriage. I have been treated unfairly and abused by my wife and her family. My wife kicks me out at will, I have to sleep in the car for days or in the basement. She would sometimes take the children to her parents refusing me to see them for weeks because of our misunderstandings. On one occasion, she hit me with her shoe for coming home 20 minutes later than usual. I tried to explain what had happened to her father, but he yelled at me and called the Police. I was taken away by the Police till the next morning even though I had made an official complaint against my wife and how I was treated. I reported to the police how she used to put me and kids on powerful sleeping pills but no further action was taken on this matter.
 
There have been accusations by my wife that I have been physically violent towards her and my two children (Ma Chowdhury and Ay  Begum). I put it to this court today that I have never been physically violent towards my wife or children. I love my children too much to harm them in any way.  
The petitioner had also claim that I am a danger to myself and those around me. She claimed I had tried to harm myself severally and have tried hurting her as well. I put it to this court that these claims are untrue. I have no intention of harming myself or anyone. She had claimed I was into hard drugs and reported to my family in 2016 that I had mental issues. I also deny these claims and put it to this court that these claims are also untrue. I admit before this court that I occasionally engage in smoking marijuana. However, I was just a social smoker and never smoked heavily. I have since the 2nd of January 2020 stopped any involvement or attempt to smoke marijuana and I have taken the initiative to quit smoking for good. I took a test on the 27th of January to proof that I am clean from any marijuana use (a copy of this test is presented to this court, today). Nonetheless, if the court wishes for me to carry out any independent drug or mental test, I hereby consent to these tests.
 
I have tried to report this matter to the police severally but have been threatened by my wife and my family. They threaten not to grant me access to my children, they threaten to send me back to Bangladesh, they even took my passport at some point and refused to return it.
The petitioner locked me in the basement for seven days with no heating or food. I went to her family to plead my case but only met with insult and abuses from them. I was beaten by her father and her brother and stripped of 3000$.
My wife upset by my action reported me to the police. The police unable to find any concrete evidence of wrongdoing freed me and allowed me to go back home. Unsatisfied with the decision of the police, she filed a case at the family court with several allegations such as those identified above. She was granted an order of protection which restricts me from seeing my children or going anywhere near them or my wife or my home. Till date, I have not visited that area or texted my wife, her parents or family,
 
I have never tried to start a fight with my wife or family, instead, I have tried to bring a solution to this situation and begged my wife and family in order to move past this. I no one in the U.S.A but my wife, her family and my children. My brothers and sisters, and my 85 years old mother are all in Bangladesh. All I am looking for is an opportunity to see my children again and be a good father to them.
I want to start my life afresh with my two beautiful children. I plead with this honorable court to grant me this privilege. I am unsure what the future holds for me and their mother but as it stands, if she chooses to divorce, I am happy to sign the papers and co-parent with her. All I seek is an opportunity to be a part of my children’s life.
 
I thank the court and the honorable judge for thier consideration on this matter.",samichyy,2020-01-18 12:13:33,3,976,58.25,37.53,72.51,22.59,18.77,14.96,90.16,58.81,20.9,16.39,12.3,0.1,0,2.77,1.23,4.51,5.94,15.47,6.66,3.28,7.38,1.23,12.91,2.97,1.33,0.72,1.64,1.64,4.82,2.25,2.46,0.51,1.23,0.31,13.22,5.33,0.1,4.3,1.23,8.71,1.54,1.43,0.61,2.66,1.23,2.97,0.82,0.51,0.1,0.2,2.05,0.31,0.82,0,0.82,12.09,4.82,1.95,4.2,1.54,0.82,5.12,6.76,0.72,11.17,2.15,4.71,4.3,1.64,1.84,1.95,0,0,0,0.2,0,0.1,0,0.1,0,10.66,5.84,2.77,0,0,0,0,0.72,0,0.2,1.02,0.1
eqmznx,"Need help, not sure what to do","Hello everyone,

I want to start of by saying that this is a burner account. In no way am I keeping this account after this discussion or connecting myself to my other account. I really need some help because I am torn and a complete mess right now, and I have no idea what to do. I'll tell the story as best as I can and hopefully receive some sound advice.

I met my wife almost ten years ago. We were madly in love, and still are, but it is starting to feel very much like the flavor of the day. The highs are high, but the lows are extremely low. We both came from some messed up childhoods and carried baggage into our marriage. I was abused verbally and physically. I would try to explain myself or say something and instead I was treated like I was in an interrogation. I was constantly told I was a fuck up, I wasn't allowed to say anything and then I had to take whatever punishment I received in silence, whether it was being hit repeatedly or carrying drywall by myself for hours and running hill sprints until I puked. I hate not being heard. I am fine with being wrong, but I want so badly to just be heard, to feel like a person.

My wife was hit a fair amount when she was younger, and her mom had an angry streak. I don't know all of the details, but she has suffered with depression for a long time. What has resulted is that she doesn't like people being angry or upset. When she does she either tries to fix it or cuts people off (do you see where this is going?).

Our marriage has been stressful, and early on in our marriage a fight would ensue over something stupid and mundane. I would get upset, she would get mad, I would try to talk, she would cut me off, and then I would shut down. She would yell at me to just talk and say what I had to, and when I tried she would talk over me and yell at me. Finally I would get so frustrated with trying to talk I would either leave or throw something. I never hit her or tried to throw anything at her. I often tried to leave the situation but couldn't. She would block the door or grab me forcefully or hit my chest.

Over the years we have gone to marriage counseling multiple times (I have always initiated it) and tried to work on our issues. I have always been brutally honest. I love this women with everything I have. I made a vow to her. What came is for me to count to ten, be more patient, touch her and kindly remind her that she is cutting me off. To let her know that I don't think its a good idea to talk right now, and that we can later but right now it is being tabled because she isn't respecting me as a person. Those talks haven't worked. I have tried to do all of those things and she still cuts me off, yells at me to just talk, and when I try to let her know she isn't treating me respectfully she just tells me to just talk then. When finally realize we need to stop the cycle and come back to this discussion later, she says no and tries to fix it.

This last Time was horrible. We had a fight a month ago that resulted in me saying ""I don't feel comfortable talking about this right now because you aren't being fair and respectful"" and she forcefully grabbed me and said no. She refused to let me leave. Then she just yelled at me. I ended up on the floor crying.

Now we've had another fight a week ago and I cannot stop thinking about it. She made a rude remark that was hurtful about our future and I said that it wasn't appropriate. I tried to have some space from her and she ripped into me. I tried talking in a normal voice to her sitting down and she just cut me off and kept yelling. I asked her to not do that and tried talking. It didn't;t work. I tried again. It didn't work. I said this conversation is being put on hold then and she said no. She blocked the front door and wouldn't let me leave. I got angry and threw a small basket holding keys. She got made and grabbed me. I tried walking away and going to a separate room and she she grabbed me around the neck with both hands, it felt like she was strangling me. I told her to get off me and lost it. I slammed a door and was sitting against it and she kept kicking until she got in and then grabbed me by the hair. I was sobbing and telling her to just leave me alone, to please leave me alone. She then proceeded to threaten me by saying that she was going to call my graduate program (Im in a doctoral program) and get me kicked out. those were her words. I'm at a loss.

I have slept in our guest room on an air mattress now for a week, haven't talked to her, and eaten every shitty food item I can think of. I cried nonstop for the first 4 days, and am mixed with anger, sadness, frustration, and hopelessness. I love this women but I don't know if she will ever change. I feel like she crossed over a line. I can barely look at her without getting upset, and I don't trust her now. I try so hard to show her I love her, but it just doesn't feel like I can do anything to help. She knows how much she hurts me when cuts me off, but does it anyway.

She has apologized and said how wrong it is, but this has happened numerous times now. It feels like it has escalated and now it has hit unprecedented levels. Im crying just writing this.

Please, help me.

TL;DR- Things have gotten way out of hand with my marriage. Wife went way over a line and now don't trust her.",burner2349431,2020-01-18 13:54:03,4,1070,16.51,43.68,70.35,2.28,15.07,11.68,94.95,62.52,22.62,16.73,10,1.21,0.19,5.33,0,5.89,3.83,12.34,11.12,5.05,9.16,2.8,23.74,3.64,1.68,1.5,0.37,1.59,6.82,2.06,4.77,0.56,2.24,1.4,13.93,0.84,0.09,5.89,0,11.78,1.78,1.4,1.96,2.71,1.12,3.93,4.21,0.28,2.15,1.68,1.59,0.56,0.37,0.09,0.19,9.53,2.99,2.43,2.9,1.21,0.75,7.38,13.27,1.31,15.79,2.43,7.01,6.64,0.93,0.09,0.56,0.28,0,0,0.28,0.19,0,0,0,0.09,13.27,6.54,3.46,0,0.19,0.09,0,0.09,0.19,2.15,0.56,0
eqo7gi,Finally in a Safe Place,"After a rough few months of being in constant fear, my worst fear came true; my abuser found the hotel I was staying at. I was forced to leave in the middle of the night. I frantically packed up all of my belongings and put them in a friend’s shed. I lost all of my groceries that I had just bought because I had nowhere to put my food. I spent the night walking around town and eventually slept in the lobby of a hotel. 

The next morning I had to appear in Family Court before I could address my housing situation. I told the judge what had happened and thankfully my advocate was there and heard everything. She pulled me aside and said that there was finally a room in the domestic violence safe house. We set up a late afternoon appointment for placement there. By evening, I had a room. I finally got a good nights sleep where I didn’t have to worry about my abuser finding me. I am in a good location to easily make all of my appointments and move forward in Family Court in order to get my daughter back. 

I’m on my second day there and I’m slowly adjusting to living in a house with several other women. I have severe social anxiety, so I have been hiding in my room most of the time. I have not met all of the other women yet because I am painfully shy. I have met 2 ladies that are really nice. I’m sure I will get used to this living situation eventually, it will just take time.

eqotqm,"This might just be venting, but I have to tell someone.","I am literally lost in my mind right now. Some how I have spaced off for 3 days. Literally not living my computer chair. 

I \[29F\] and my ex \[29M\] (referencing him as Ronnie) and I were together for 3 years. We had the typical narcissistic (him)  / codependent (me) type relationship. I had to often bailed him out of dire situations (make car payments, pay court fines, cover the mortgage/all bills without his contribution). In addition to finances I did all chores regarding caring for all of the animals we had, any and all cleaning. Whatever, you get the story. He eventually began using drugs and things escalated to the extent that I couldn't handle it anymore. We broke up, he moved out 6 weeks later. 

Shortly after, a former ex \[33M\] (referencing him as Steve) and I start hanging out again. He was the typical #NiceGuy but I didn't recognize it at the time. He is at my house one night, we are getting ready to go to sleep but watching a movie. Ronnie starts calling me repeatedly. I have a bad feeling about this. I turn my phone into Do Not Disturb and do not receive notifications. Ronnie eventually shows up to my home and is knocking on the door. I ignore it. He is trying to talk to me through the window, telling me he's not trying to be weird but he needs to talk to me. It's close to 12 AM and I know that if I answer the door he is going to be inebriated and who knows what he is capable of if he knows that I have a guy over. 

He eventually kicks in the door and is very upset. I call the police. He said he came to get 2 of his left shoes (as in, he took the right ones). He starts screaming at me ""Does this dude f\*ck you like me? Does this dude eat your p\*ssy like me? I have f\*cked 15 girls since you, and they're way hotter."" I just keep asking him to please leave, the police arrive. He ends up obtaining the following charges in addition to a restraining order protecting me: domestic abuse, burglary in the 2nd, possession of meth, and weed.  

Fast forward 2 months: Steve is becoming very clingy. We go to lunch, come back from lunch and we are laying on his bed - head to feet. He pulls himself out of his pants and starts playing with himself. I tell him ""I don't know what you're getting yourself all jazzed up for, I have a stomach ache from lunch."" he says ""come here"" and I give somewhat of a chuckle of ""confusion"" and say ""no"" since I just made it clear that my stomach aches. 

He grabs a fistful of my hair, literally bending my neck back. He tries to readjust his group and I get free and my first response was to turn over onto my stomach to lift myself up, he gets on top of me and unbuttons my pants. He quickly pulls my pants down to my knees. I pull away and pull up my pants, grab a blanket and am trying to put it over me. He flips the blanket up from the end of my feet, pulls down my pants, moves and holds my legs over to the right exposing me and presses himself against me. It wasn't ""working"" because I OBVIOUSLY am not ""excited"" about what he's doing. He tries again, and again, and again and the next time it inserts. This time I literally just FROZE. I didn't make any movements. When it finally went in I said ""so this is what rape feels like"" and let out a heavy sigh. Unlike many others, I haven't experienced this as of yet. He stares at me blankly, still inside of me. I say ""might as well finish now"" and I laid there and stared at him. Afterwards there was blood, and he said ""wow, blood, just like a rape scene"". Afterwards he claims this is all a misunderstanding and claims that he was under the impression it was playful because of my laughing. I didn't think it was playful. Maybe all of this is a misunderstanding and from a different perspective I made it be playful. I can't get over it though, and I break it off. 

That all happened on Sunday, and today is Saturday. It's been almost a week, the first two days I spent in a drunken stupor, and the last 3 days and today I have been in what I think is disassociation. 

I don't know what I feel even. I feel like I want to call Ronnie and tell him what happened so bad. Ronnie did some really bad things to me, but I always felt safe with him. For some reason, even when he broke in my door I felt safe. I did not think Steve was safe though. I regret calling the cops. I wish none of this would have happened. I don't even know how to process this.

TLDR: Narcissist and codependent (my) relationship, 3 years. Narc kicks in codependent's (my) door to my house while I have a new dude there. Narc catches a lot of charges and a restraining order. New dude potentially sexually assaulted me. Now I am in a strange state of disassociation. I don't know how to break free from it, everything tastes like cardboard, I don't want to leave my house, answer my phone, and I can't sleep. I have been really fighting the urge to call Narc because of the restraining order, and because he also has a new girlfriend who I do sincerely hope he's happy with. However, he's been my best friend for 3 years. I just don't know what to do.",burner0420,2020-01-18 16:09:54,2,988,34.8,35.39,78.87,29.15,13.92,13.66,89.68,59.01,21.66,16.6,10.32,0.61,0.61,5.06,0,5.06,4.76,13.46,8.5,5.16,6.98,2.33,19.23,3.54,1.72,1.62,1.42,1.82,4.45,2.33,2.13,0.2,0.51,0.51,10.73,0,0.71,0.1,5.16,11.13,2.73,1.62,1.01,2.13,1.21,3.04,3.14,0.51,1.01,1.42,2.73,1.42,0.4,0.3,0.61,6.48,1.21,1.42,2.43,1.11,0.71,4.45,11.84,0.91,15.79,2.73,6.68,6.58,0.81,0.81,1.42,0.81,0,0,0.91,0,0.1,0,0.2,0,19.94,6.98,4.25,0.3,0,0.2,0,0.1,2.02,2.33,1.62,2.13
eqqvt4,Worst breakup ever.,"So, let me just start this off by saying that i’m completely in the wrong in this situation, i should not have done what i did. So, let’s start the night off. (20M) here, and me and my girlfriend (20F) have been together for about 5 months now. Everythings been amazing, couple small arguments here or there, nothing big. I uber about an hour away to hangout at the bar with my girlfriend (now ex) and her friend. Everything was amazing, fun, and then we ended up having her friend drive us back to my house. Once here though, a verbal nuke blew up. She was quite drunk, and i was pretty tipsy. My ex, started a huge argument over non-sensical things, and was overall saying some really fucked up things to me, so obviously i argued back. Things about my anxiety and little jokes about just what i've done in the past and who i am. Let me say this as well, neither of us are in the best shape mentally. Me, i have crippling anxiety that weighs upon every one of my relationships. She? Has some very deep rooted issues from her past, without getting into too much detail. So, the fight. We were talking like normal, and i was talking to her about the hood, and how she needs to leave that kind of life behind her.

This started her to start screaming at me, getting in my face and threatening my life. (She has “connections” if you want to call it. But basically what was said was “you wanna talk about the hood, i’ll call someone from da hood right now and they’ll kill ya” That’s a threat, and she has threatened my life before. I won’t be threatened in my own household, nor have someone in my face threatening me. So while she was screaming at me while being 2 inches from my face threatening my life, i simply pushed her shoulder back to get her away from my face. She took a step and a half backwards, it’s not like i Hulk Hogan threw her. I’m a tiny guy, it was a tiny push. But still, a push is a push. Im heartbroken. Defeated. Ashamed. Was this warranted? I know you should never push a women, or even lay a finger on them with negative intentions. But a death threat, is a death threat. Said by any gender. And she definitely has the means to have someone killed, she’s not some prissy white girl. Without going into too much detail. So of course, i took the threat very seriously. If anyone has any advice or anything, please. I know i’m wrong, so please don’t jump down my throat in the comments, I've heard enough terrible things past couple of days. Anyone have advice about this situation? I mean, like i want to move forward with this, i see a future with this girl so i don't want to throw it all away. But what are my options?

eqyjz2,Intimate Partner Violence Survey for Better Recognition and Prevention,"Hello,

My name is Cristina and I'm currently finishing my degree in medicine. Having worked now at the hospital for some years, I've encountered several cases of domestic violence, particularly from men towards women.  Since western society has increasingly recognized the subject in recent years, I've decided to do further research on the subject with the aim of improving our current prevention and diagnosis protocols.

In order to do this, we have prepared a survey for victims of intimate partner violence to take. It should take around 5-10 minutes to complete. If you'd like to participate, here's the link to the post containing the survey:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/eqyezx/academic\_intimate\_partner\_violence\_indicators\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/eqyezx/academic_intimate_partner_violence_indicators_for/)

er3ic0,Do violent abusive men ever truly change?,"I'm looking for answers from people who have been in a domestic abuse situation or more specifically from men who have issues with anger and have been violent towards women (especially since this is all anonymous)

I have been with my Partner for about a year and a half. Yesterday I received a message from his ex informing me that he had been very violent towards here. She described the attacks in detail and sent screen shots of messages between them to back this up. She then sent screen shots between herself and his ex before her confirming he did the same to her. This behavior started about a year or less into their relationships, and I was told his triggers were thinking they were cheating on him.

It didn't end with the end of the relationship as he continued to stay in their houses, refuse to move out, break in and stalk. This is the part that worries me most. This all happened 7 years ago or more. 

Now, while my Partner has lied to me and been caught out in the past. He has never been violent or abusive towards me in any way, he's never even raised his voice at me, even when provoked with me being bitch towards him. He is very evasive about his past but behaves like he's always been this calm. He's very caring, giving, non jealous, chilled out and loving with me.

We both work away from home and are currently away. I'm flying home to get security cameras installed in my house, and this afternoon I'll call him and tell him what I know and ask him to be honest with me about his past.

era8ea,A week since the abuse,"I am having a hard time realizing what has happened. We didn’t break up- he just attacked me and I decided it was over. Now I’m experiencing new emotions/ feelings...

My partner attacked me when he was drunk so now if I’m around a man who is belligerently drunk I start to get agitated. If anyone tries to demand too much of me I get irritated. And there are times when I want to be absolutely alone. 

I’m trying to be respectful of his things even if he wasn’t respectful of my space-but I just want to throw out all his things. To top it off there are times when I’m just around too many people (crowds) that I start to get panicky and sweaty. Finally, I’m finding that there are times when my whole body starts shaking and I start to cry or have a panic attack. 

My abuser is also going around and telling people that I broke his foot and choked him?! He was the one who choked me.  He was the one who brutalized my body and infiltrated my mind with his constant verbal assault. Ugh!

erf20i,How can I help heal from the abuse I put my boyfriend through?,"Hi everyone. This is going to be rough but I need advice badly. I am a 22F dating a 19M. We have been dating for two years now. Our relationship has always been rocky and its because of me most of the time. I cheated on him more times than I can remember. I punched him in the mouth so badly that he needed to have oral surgery. And I kicked him in the testicles so hard he had to go to the ER and they almost removed a testicle. Since then, I have gotten sober from methamphetamine and dedicated my life to helping others who have survived domestic abuse.

What I am struggling with is how to I heal from all this? I am left with so much guilt over what happened that it cripples me on a daily basis. Seeing how my boyfriend has stuck with me all this time and forgives me for everything is incredible, but I feel so guilty over what I did to him.

I'm currently in therapy and my therapist suggests that my boyfriend join our sessions, but my boyfriend says he is ""okay"" and doesn't need to go. I have offered to pay but he still refuses. He does have his own therapist, but his therapist does not do couples sessions.

Are there any other former abusers who can maybe share their experiences?

erf3sb,Long Post but I don't know what to do about my mother's possibly emotionally and financially abusive boyfriend,"Im trying to keep this as short as possible, but I really need help with all this because I feel like we are drowning.

My mother is in a possibly abusive relationship, I don't know whether my past is clouding my judgement here which is why I say possibly.

Her boyfriend of 3/4 years was very nice at first, mostly because she wasn't very into him and he was very aggressive in his pursuing to the point where he followed her home from the local pub, and had his mail redirected to our address after a month of sort of seeing each other.
Still, he would take her on trips, was generous with gifts and would plan nice dates. She was employed, but she hated her job, so he decided to call her boss names and ultimately got her fired. She was offered a job in a mixed sex gym but he threw a tantrum so she didn't take it. She then became the book keeper for his company.
 After a year they decided to move, my mother sold our house and paid half of the new home, and they took out a loan for the second half which he pays. On the moving night, he drank himself to oblivion because he ""had already worked harder than everyone"" in front of our family helping us move, and was aggressive. He called my older sister (24, now 26) a cunt, broke things and we believe he may have pushed our mother (didn't witness, just found her on the ground and him angrily above her).

The drinking is a massive problem, he drinks everynight, and he sometimes becomes nasty and has called us both cunts, calls her other names and tells her that everyone will leave her but him. He will tell her she's not perfect, that she blames him for everything, ect. He doesn't let her have opinions on things and routinely controls how she does things. At the last election she didn't vote for who he told her to and he still yells at her for that a year later. She is responsible for buying all the household stuff, if he buys food it stays locked up in his downstairs fridge until he wants to use it. What she buys is scrutinised, to the point where he questions her buying more than one yoghurt. She has said multiple times she wants to be dead, but at this current time sees no way out. My own mental health has severely deteriorated in the past 2 years from the situation. I'm scared that one day he will become physically violent and hurt her. 
Tldr; Mother's boyfriend is controlling, an alcoholic, took away her financial independence. Is this classified as emotional abuse and how can I help her see that she doesn't have to stay?
Also, how likely is he to resort to physical violence?",drphilslefttit,2020-01-20 08:03:22,2,501,25.57,92.17,2.29,1.29,21.78,15.37,94.41,58.88,22.95,17.76,2.99,1.6,0,12.77,0.4,5.19,4.79,11.78,9.58,4.39,7.78,2,18.56,4.99,2.4,2.4,2.2,1.2,5.19,1,4.19,0.2,2.59,0.4,21.56,1.4,0.6,7.98,6.59,12.38,2.2,2.2,1.4,2.4,1.2,3.59,1.8,0.6,0.6,0.6,1.8,0,0.8,0.2,1,6.99,3.19,0.8,2,1.2,0.2,6.79,10.78,1.6,14.37,2,7.19,5.39,2.4,1.4,1.4,2,0,0.4,0.6,0.4,0.2,0,0,0,13.57,3.99,5.19,0,0.2,0.4,0,0,0.4,2.4,0.8,0.2
eriip1,Helping an acquaintance escape,"A former employer called me today, asking if I couldn’t remember any stories of his wife acting “crazy“. It was a small business that he ran out of his house, so I spent a lot of time with his wife and his kids in the general area, and interacted with them sometimes. He said they were getting divorced, and he wanted to build a case that she had some kind of undiagnosed mental illness. This felt off to me, from the short time that I had known and worked with them, so I reached out to her separately. She sent me back photos and videos documenting a pattern of ongoing abuse that were frankly horrifying. 

So my basic question is: now what? Obviously I don’t know the whole situation so I want to follow her lead and not make any decisions without her, but if there are shelters, legal aid groups, or other organizations that could help i’d like to at least have names and phone numbers to give her.

erj8s3,Psychotic ex boyfriend keeps using google voice phone numbers to call me. I have a restraining order in place but no hard proof it’s actually him calling because I never pick up. What do I do?,"I know it’s him because when I trace the numbers I’m able to find out it’s a google voice number, I just can’t get ahold of hard info with his name attached to it. Back when we were together he would do this all the time. He would get mad about something stupid and start hitting me, I would get sick of it and block him, and he would call me using different google voice numbers over and over. He eventually sexually assaulted me in a parking garage, I had to have an abortion, and then he tried to kill me when he found out I got rid of the baby. 

I filed a restraining order and basically went into hiding after that. Deleted most of my social media, changed my number, and moved back home because he would always pop up at my apartment. I was scared to be there alone when my roommate wasn’t home. 

I have changed my phone number so many times over the years and he still keeps finding it.  There was even one point when I stopped using regular phone service and only used apps because I figured it was the best way to hide from him. you can only rely on that so for long though before it becomes an inconvenience and people start wondering why you don’t have a regular phone number. I don’t know how he keeps finding my number but I’m sick of it. 

The reason I don’t want to just change my number yet again is because 1) I’m in the middle of job hunting for a career change. My current number is what I have listed on my resume and all the applications I did. 

and 2) - my current boyfriend is going to find it weird that I changed my number with no good explanation. He kind of knows about this situation but he doesn’t know how severe it actually was. I don’t want to have to explain this to him or my family who doesn’t know about this and who will also wonder why I changed my number yet again.",nothanksitstoocold,2020-01-20 12:37:28,0,388,10.98,30.3,83.33,4.66,20.42,13.4,91.24,60.82,21.91,15.98,10.82,0.26,0.52,4.38,0,5.93,4.12,10.82,10.57,9.02,8.76,2.84,19.85,4.12,1.55,3.35,0.77,1.03,3.09,0.52,2.58,0.26,1.03,0.26,10.31,0.52,0.77,0,4.9,16.24,4.64,5.41,1.8,1.55,1.29,2.58,2.32,0,1.8,0.52,1.03,0,0.77,0.52,0,6.7,1.8,0.77,2.32,1.55,0.77,5.15,12.89,1.03,14.95,2.32,5.93,6.7,1.29,0.77,1.55,0,0,0.26,0.52,0,0.26,0,0,0,11.08,4.64,1.8,0,0,0.26,0,0.26,0,3.61,0.52,0

erwpis,Need help for a friend,"Hello Reddit.  I come to you in a time of much distress.   A close and dear friend of mine is caught up in a difficult situation with her soon to be ex husband.  I dont even know where to start.  

&amp;#x200B;

Shes about 11 years into her marriage.  His control and emotional abuse has taken her to the point of trying to divorce him again.  On several occasions she has called the police and they have done nothing but seemingly take his side.  A couple months ago, the last time she tried getting help from police, they caught him in the act of disabling her car (so she couldnt leave and he could continue berating her and throwing things).  The police still insisted she leave and stay at her mothers!  He could have been cutting brake lines!  So now she has no faith in police intervention.  Her divorce attorney seems toothless, hes not giving her helpful advice.  Shes feeling hopeless and I know she has to get out of there.  

&amp;#x200B;

Last night he was driving and they started fighting.  He wouldnt let her leave the car.  Driving erraticly and rolling stop signs and otherwise being reckless.  For nearly an hour he did this to her so he could continue yelling and screaming without a chance of escape. Shes more afraid for her life than ever and so am i!

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is her battle, I know there isn't much I can do beyond giving her the best moral support I can muster.   Please, I ask for anything that I can do to help.  ANy breadcrumb that can lead to a solution, a hope, anything.  Can she try contacting a different police station the next city over?  Can she go over the cops heads somehow?  Does she need proof to file a PPO?  Why is her lawyer so useless?  Is there a support group of somekind?  

&amp;#x200B;

erwsgk,Abuser dumped me this time. Need support,"I left abusive ex for over a week. I couldn't stay at my friend's house anymore so I came back to ex's place and stayed for about a week. I started looking at rooms to rent straight away. He told me that he loves me. He said there's no rush, also told me to live with him. I went ahead and rented a room anyway. I still stayed at his for a few more nights. During this it was a mix of him telling me to tell the landlord that I don't want the new room anymore  and the other times he was telling me he wants space and for me to go home to mine. He said he is confused. I obviously got annoyed about that and said that it's him wanting control. He said to basically enjoy the new crap house. I called him an abuser (my previous posts has details of the verbal and physical abuse). I was dumb amd went over his to apologize and he just said he's done with me and to get it through my head that he doesn't want me and that he only let me back since I couldn't stay at my friend's. He was pretty hurtful with his words and basically blamed me for everything. For some reason I basically begged him. And it just made it worse. It's just because of everything that's happened prior and any other time he would say sorry and fight for it. One time basically holding me against my will in the old house. I just feel pathetic and worthless now more than ever. I don't know what to do. I litterely can't get over it.

erx4rb,Help,"I'm not even sure where to start, and this is going to be so long but i need to let this out and get advice from people who dont know me personally, and have maybe been through something similar. But it all started off when I got too drunk to drive and backed into a dumpster one night and then the girls I was with called my boyfriend (who I was broken up with at the time) to come and take me home. He came and drove me home and when we got to my place we started fighting. I dont even remember what it was about I was so wasted, but he kept grabbing me by my biceps and throwing me down on the bed and something in me snapped after him doing that so many times and I hit him like in his chest, after that he slapped the fuck out of me and that was the very first time ANYONE has ever laid their hands on me like that. He verbally abused me the whole time saying how I'm just a worthless drunk, i keep crashing my car, hes ginna manifest sleeping with my friends, etc... And I quit fighting and went to lie down, we ended up having sex and he stayed the night. Fast forward to a couple weeks later and we were broken up again, because his way of solving our problems was always to break up, I had went out to the bar with my friends and saw him out at the bar with one of my old friends from high school... at the end of the night when I was going home, some guy messaged me and i told him to come over. We ended up hooking up. It was just a one night hook up, me and this guy weren't even talking or hanging out prior to this night.. but eventually me and the boyfriend got back together and he found out about that. And I found out he slept with my old friend, and didnt use a condom. She claimed he got her pregnant but no one really believes her, it could've been possible though. She did get an ""abortion"" though so there was never any proof she was pregnant by him. But even though we both hooked up he didnt see his fault and only saw mine, how big of a whore I was, and that I would fuck anyone for anything... etc... we ended up ""making up"" after he hit me a few times and called me every name under the sun. But even though he says he forgave me he still to this day holds that over my head and calls me out of my name because of it. I can't even explain everything that's happened because it's all so stupid it doesnt even make sense. But over the past 7 months I have been berated, belittled, hit in the face/head, got my mouth busted, been hit in the stomach after I told him I could be pregnant.. and he says he wants me to have his baby... hes pulled my hair, has literally choked me out unconcious. I think I've been abused every single possible way you could imagine. Hes made me give him a bj after we've fought to make up... basically I dont know where I'm going with all this. Everyone always tells me to just leave but I literally can't just leave. I have personal belongings at his house and he doesnt work so there isn't a time where he isn't there. And anytime I do try to leave he always tries to break my stuff and throw my clothes around and blocks the door. He'll hide my keys and phone and lock me inside the bedroom so I cant go anywhere or call for help. And I know after all this, I sound so crazy, but I do love him and care for him and I'm stuck in this situation thinking things will change and be better. Because it's not always this bad. Sometimes we have amazing days and have the best time together, but I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells at those times because I dont wanna fuck up the good time. I cant talk to my parents about this because I already told them too much and I don't want them to hate him.... and I don't have any friends anymore. Even if I did I wouldn't say these things to them, because I cant trust them. I just need a listening ear, someone who doesnt know me personally. Someone who isn't just gonna say ""leave him""... because I know I need to leave. But I literally cant... I need someone who's been through this type of thing before to give me some strength. I'm so scared one of these days hes going to hit me in my head or knock me out cold and I'm never gonna wake up. I think about how much my nephew means to me and that he may never get to see his auntie again. Or that my parents know to an extent what's going on, and that they couldn't do nothing to help me. I'm so scared they're gonna have to bury their only baby girl. Hes always threatening that hes going to kill me, and the only way out of our relationship is for me to die. Hes said he put a GPS somewhere on my car and he knows where I am and that I cant ever hide. He knows where my parents live and if I do leave him I'm scared to death hes going to come there and try to shoot up our house or hurt my family. The hurt and pain I'm going through is nothing I've ever been through before and I cant fucking get away from it. I'm such a strong and beautiful person and I know my worth... so it just fucks me up even more that I'm going through all this shit. You guys, im begging for any advice that isn't just to leave him. I need to hear some real shit from people who have been through this. I need help.",hotpockeys,2020-01-21 08:37:50,0,1042,10.79,38.29,87.26,7.14,19.3,10.17,96.35,64.4,24.86,18.62,11.42,1.15,0.19,5.18,0.67,6.14,3.45,13.24,9.79,7.29,9.79,3.26,22.26,3.07,1.54,1.82,0.77,2.11,4.03,1.15,2.78,0.38,1.54,0.29,15.07,1.06,0.96,0.77,5.37,14.01,2.21,1.73,1.73,2.98,2.4,3.93,2.3,0.48,1.06,0.67,3.65,1.54,0.77,1.25,0.48,8.35,3.17,0.86,3.17,1.25,0.67,6.24,13.53,1.82,17.18,3.74,7.2,6.53,0.19,0.58,0.86,0.19,0,0.38,1.15,0.77,0.29,0,0,0,14.2,7.29,2.78,0,0,0,0,0,0.58,3.26,0.19,0.1
eryshh,I can’t deal with my dad anymore,"My dad is way too much. If I don’t watch literally everything I say, then he ends up getting extremely offended. I asked him why he still sees his abusive parents and he proceeded to use an extremely aggressive, slightly loud voice to tell me how he is extremely mature and I am just a child and will never understand. He shouts at me and talks down to and it tears me down and pulls me to pieces. After an hour or two, sometimes only 5 minutes, he comes and either apologised and if I stay upset he (yet again) will tell me how immature I am or he will get really upset and he looks like he is about to cry. Sometimes he will just completely ignore what he has just done and will act so kind to me and it makes me feel like shit to continue being angry or upset so I just give in and end up apologising myself. 

Before you say, there is no way to avoid it, he will tell me off for not liking a book, not taking a plate out even if I’ve just finished using it (he is very inconsistent, he told me off for the plate for the first time ever in my life today) for not understanding school work, for not taking his advice when I know much much more on the subject matter. 

I still have at least 7 years of still living here and I love my mam so I don’t want to rush to move out. My dad will be really nice for a month or so and the whole thing will happen again. I’m not sure if this counts as domestic violence but I don’t know where else to put it. If there is somewhere else u think it belongs then please let me know and I’ll move it.

es1ix8,We’ve been so shitty to each other.,"I really need to vent. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 and a half years. It seems that we’re in a weird, soft breakup right now. I told him I couldn’t handle the relationship anymore because I’m so exhausted and jaded from everything that’s happened. He said he feels the same and we just need space to breathe and think. 

This is the first time I’m ever admitting it, I’ve never told a friend or my therapist but... he’s physically hurt me countless times. I know you’re probably thinking “wtf why are you still with him, why forgive him?” Because I didn’t have the fucking strength to leave. I thought I deserved it because in total honesty, I was extremely emotionally abusive. 

I can’t help but think I’ve brought us here. We both feel crippling amounts of guilt. It sounds fucked up, but we love each other. Maybe we’re just codependent, but there’s definitely been love and support. Funny enough, he’s never tried to control me, never been overtly jealous or possessive. He’s encouraged me to be myself and be confident. Yet, behind closed doors, we bring out the worst in each other. I have so much pride and I can’t admit when I’m wrong. He hates feeling controlled and confined (which is what I do to him often), thus we got into so many physical confrontations. 

I know we need to stop. We’re smarter than this yet somehow, we’ve been so dependent on each other for love and so weak that we could never let go. No one knows. I’ve felt so alone. I’m sure he has, too. 

If anyone can or even cares, please just let me know your thoughts. I haven’t seen him in almost a week (longest we’ve gone without seeing each other) and I feel so lost. 

I love him so much and I wish I’d never been a manipulative psycho, and he a temperamental asshole. We’ve done this to each other. We’ve hurt each other beyond words. How do we even still love each other? I wonder if it could ever be mended.",yawaworth1010,2020-01-21 13:37:30,3,357,1,47.76,83.69,21.47,11.16,14.85,95.52,63.31,25.77,19.05,9.52,4.76,0.84,3.92,0,6.72,3.08,7.56,13.17,12.04,9.8,3.36,24.65,3.64,1.4,1.68,1.12,3.92,10.36,5.04,5.32,0.28,2.24,1.12,14.85,0,0.56,0,4.2,22.13,5.32,2.8,2.52,3.64,3.64,6.72,3.36,0.56,0.56,2.24,4.2,0.84,1.4,0.56,0,12.32,7.84,1.4,2.52,0.56,0.84,7.28,15.13,0.28,11.76,1.4,4.48,5.88,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,1.4,1.4,0.28,0,0,0,23.25,8.96,4.2,0,0,0.56,0,0,0.56,7.84,1.12,0

es2e91,"My friend and coworker (35F) is in an abusive relationship, and I don't think I can help her.","Sadly I think this is an example of a ""You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink"" scenario, but maybe the people of Reddit have some advice I haven't thought of yet.

My friend has been dating this guy (35M) for a little over a year now, on and off. For the first few months, it seemed like they were doing great. She was so happy, which was great to see because whe had finally left her husband who had been cheating on her for 15+ years. But then something changed. This guy she was dating did a complete 180. She came into work with a busted lip about 6 months back, and said she was done with him. I urged her to go to the police, but she said he had a record of assault and she didn't want him to go to prison.

And a few weeks later, she was back with him. Said she wasn't the kind of person to give up on the people she cared about. And to make a long story short, this cycle has been repeating itself for over half a year now. They fight, she says she is through with him, then a week later she comes into work and is talking about the night she had with him, like nothing happened.

Honestly, this guy is crazy. She's shown me her phone, when they are fighting he will send her literally hundreds of text messages a day, calling her every single derogatory word for a woman you can think of. Just non stop for hours at a time, day and night. He says she makes him insane, that she doesn't know how to love, that she's crazy, disgusting, abusive, ect. I've asked her why she doesnt just block his number, and she says she can't just block out someone she once cared about. She's not that kind of person. She says he's like this when he goes on an adderall binge, and that it's not his fault because he was prescribed it as a kid and now he can't live without it.

Last week she was talking about breaking the lease on her apartment and moving in with him, to save money. When she brought it up to him, they got into an argument and he picked her up and tried to throw her down a flight of stairs. She said she was done with him for good, but she yesterday she was texting him but physically keeping her distance. Today she came in to work and said she had been spending time with him again last night! Less than a WEEK after he tried to seriously hurt her. 

I've tried asking her why she thinks she deserves to be treated like this, and she says she doesn't. She's in therapy. She acknowledges that she is in a terrible relationship,  but she likes the attention. She talks about it with some of our coworkers and they have offered her support, safety, help moving, whatever. I've helped her move her stuff out of his place a few times. She's financially independent, has her own place, and has no problem getting dates. Seriously, at least once a week she gets some guys number at work.

I don't think I can get the police involved, because I don't have evidence of any of this. Just what she has told me, and she won't tell the police anything. She refuses to talk to them because it would ""get him put away for a long time"" due to his record. I've tried rationalizing with her, pointing out that she wasted 15 years of her life in a bad relationship already, so she shouldn't waste any more years of her life being treated like this. She agrees. I've tried being understanding and supportive, but now I am having a hard time hiding my disdain for the guy. Which probably doesn't help her at all, but I'm so disgusted by this guy.

I care about her as a friend. And it makes me so sad that she just takes this. But at the same time, as bad as it sounds, I'm starting to get frustrated with her as well. I feel bad for thinking ""Well I don't want to hear about it anymore if you're going to keep going back to him."" Does that make me a terrible friend?

I don't think I can help her, and listening to her talk about how he treats her day in and day out is maddening. Is there anything I can do, or do I just accept that it's a futile battle?

es71yj,I need advice,"Long story short, I (21F) was in a very abusive long term relationship throughout high school into my first two years of college. It was everything, sexually, physically, and verbally. I’ve been out of that relationship for over a year and a half now and I have received medical help for my trauma. But the ex (19M) will not let me go to this day. He refuses to believe that we will never have a chance together. He still thinks that I am his soulmate, all that stuff. Yet he also blames me for everything that went wrong in his life after we broke up. After we broke up, both him and I dropped out of college and I went back and built myself a new life with an amazingly sweet guy. Meanwhile, he joined the army and has had several failed relationship. I know that I am not to blame, but yet there remains that little voice telling me that I am. I don’t know what to do anymore. I can change my number and he’ll still call me on restricted numbers. I don’t know what to do anymore.

es8e4l,I’m free. I got out. I’m myself again.,"I posted a couple months back about the realization that my husband was emotionally and sexually abusive. Since then I have moved into my own apartment, separated our finances and am filling out divorce paperwork. 

I’m very fortunate in that I have a loving supportive family close by. And while they don’t know the full extent to how bad things were they know enough to not question my decision at all. 

I’ve been making some changes in my life, being more social, trying to make myself go do the things that I have wanted to but just put off because I didn’t have to motivation. 

I’ve started taking pride in my appearance again, not because I feel like I have to for anyone but because I want to for myself. 

I go hang out with my little niece and nephew and we have dancing and singing parties before bedtime. The 30 minute drive to them is something I’m happy to do but was always too much of a chore for my ex. 

I’m referring to my ex as ‘my ex’. Legally we might still be married but that relationship is over. 

I’m planning vacations for myself, visiting friends and family that I haven’t seen or talked to in years because we never made the effort to travel to them. 

I’m turning thirty in a couple weeks and am flying to San Francisco to celebrate with some of my closest friends. 

And most importantly: I am lying in bed right now and the thought occurred to me. No one is going to lock me in a dog crate, no one is going to humiliate me for their own pleasure tonight. 

I got out.

es8u3r,Really needing advice badly,"So I have issues with binge drinking. I’m 19f and living at home with my boyfriend who moved in after his parents cut off support because he got a dui. I physically fight him when i get so blackout drunk that I have absolutely no memory the next day. I never know who instigates it. I have hit him but I don’t know who hits first. I have been getting better and the binge drinking incidents are happening less frequently. We have ben having problems in our relationship and we were drinking last night. I was not in the blackout state and was lucid and coherent when he started pushing me and throwing me down on the ground. it was not ambiguous at all and he was clearly the aggressor. He was mad that I was making too much noise so he was throwing me down over and over on the ground and wouldnt allow me to get up. I have bruises, cuts and swelling. My parents got involved and took his side. My dad said I was lying about the incident and kept laughing at me and calling me drunk. I cannot stop feeling sick thinking about him laughing at me. My mom kept texting me complaining multiple times about the noise and she did not care what was happening either she was just wanting me to be quieter. I then tried to go to see my old friend who has her own serious issues (meth addict) because i didnt feel safe in the house. I made it three hours out of the eight hour drive and had a panic attack and called my boyfriend. He stayed with me om the phone all the way back and was so incredibly nice. It seems like all our issues are gone now (I know this is a manipulation tactic to get me to forget what happened. He spent the whole day with me and treated me so well. I even lied to my professors saying my grandma died to get the week off school to visit my friend because Iwas scared for my safety. So now I am with him for the week and he is being so incredibly over the top nice and caring. But when i got ready for my shower tonight seeing the bruises and the cuts was making me feel sick. I am scared to tell a counselor because I believe in my blackout states I am the aggressor sometimes, which makes me feel like i cant be guilty about this. I just want advice because I literally have no one at all",ornage-banana,2020-01-21 23:50:51,21,440,23.35,31.67,82.43,9.16,16.92,14.77,93.41,58.41,20.45,17.05,12.27,0.91,0,3.86,0,3.41,5.23,10.68,9.09,6.14,8.86,2.5,21.59,3.86,1.82,2.27,0.91,2.05,6.82,2.73,4.09,0.91,1.59,0,11.36,1.14,0.91,1.14,3.86,10.68,2.73,2.5,1.14,0.68,1.59,2.27,3.18,0.45,1.82,0.91,2.95,0,1.82,0,1.59,8.86,2.73,0.91,2.5,2.27,0.91,7.95,9.77,0.45,14.32,1.59,6.36,6.82,0.68,1.14,0.68,0.23,0,0.23,0.45,0,0,0.23,0.23,0,7.05,5.45,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.45,0.68,0
esc3sw,"I triggered someone else's trauma, and now","I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit. I lurk a lot but never post. Please feel free to guide me elsewhere if I'm in the wrong place.

***TL;DR:*** *I \[28F\] slapped a guy \[32M\] with playful intent, triggered his traumas and now I'm questioning if I'm actually an abuser and if I'm misremembering past events.*

**Background:** I've been in two relationships which were characterised by violence and I struggle to remember all the details clearly. I've been hit, pinned against walls, punched, kicked, had drinks poured over me and one ex tried to push me down a flight of stairs. If I'm remembering correctly, most, if not all, instances happened during verbal arguments. I know that I fought back on multiple occasions, but now I'm not sure if I was defending myself (as I remember) or if I instigated because of recent events. 

**Context for event:** I was on a date, we were chilling out in a hotel doing exactly what you'd expect in a hotel. When we were lying there watching TV and chatting, the guy made a joke (I can't even remember what it was to be honest) and I slapped him. The intent of my slap was a playful one, like ""what are you like? I can't believe you said that!"" and basically where I pictured it going was ""Oh, did you seriously just slap me?"" ""Yeah, what are you going to do about it? Punish me?"" as this is a tried and tested method I've used quite a lot with guys and it's always ended in like... roleplay? For want of a better word. 

How it actually went down was he said exactly what I was expecting, but his tone wasn't the one I was expecting, and I got a bit confused because I was hearing the words I had anticipated, but I couldn't figure out if his tone was right, or if he was genuinely angry or upset with me for doing it. So I just kind of shut down, then after a few minutes everything went back to normal, so I thought nothing more of it. I guess I thought he was just kind of taken by surprise but didn't realise he was genuinely bothered by it. I'm not very good at reading social situations.

**Event:** So, we were still texting after the date, but he didn't suggest going on another one and I figured he'd just decided he wasn't interested for whatever reason. I made a joke about him checking my status/story but leaving me on read. Here's a transcript of the conversation:

Me: Hahaha jokes, are you feeling any better? I was gonna ask the other day but thought you'd maybe decided to ghost hahahahah

Him: The last one lol

Me: Just a meme i thought was funny???

Me: Wait

Me: Did you think it was directed at you or something hahahahah

Him: Yeah well I wouldn't say ghosted you

Him: If I'm being honest. With \[redacted\] I was in an abusive relationship and had all sorts of stuff done to me and when you slapped me over some joke I'd made was a massive red flag for me. I'm a big believer in equality and it wouldn't be right for me to ever slap you. Not that I would, but I mean f\*\*k me, what would you do if I ever did something seriously wrong? I was chatting to my mates about it and people were like yeah that's super f\*\*ked up.

Me: Okay, I totally appreciate where you're coming from with that. I honestly just meant it in like a playful way, not an aggressive one or anything. I know that doesn't change how it affected you or anything.

Me: I'm sorry to hear that you went through something like that and believe it or not I've been on the receiving end of physical abuse before. Honestly I'm kinda dumb af with reading situations so like when you reacted the way you did I wasn't sure if that was your sense of humour (like the deadpan kinda thing) or if you were genuinely annoyed and that's why I just kinda went quiet about it.

Me: I'm really sorry for causing any painful memories or anything, it honestly was just me trying to do a kinda playful thing and not done with any malicious intent at all. But I get it and I am genuinely sorry about all of it.

Me: Okay, I think my essay is done

Him: You're grand

Me: I should have picked up on the fact that you were actually upset about it and explained/apologised then.

Me: F\*\*k I feel like such a d\*\*k for not like picking up on that. Sorry, pestering now

Me: Just as idk an FYI I did have a great time that weekend. And I'm sorry again that I did something to make you feel so sh\*\*ty and made such a d\*\*k of myself by being thoughtless af with my actions. You seem really great and I hope you're able to find someone that's like, not a total idiot about things like this lmao. But I appreciate the honesty about it.

Me: And again I'm so sorry

Him: It's grand

**What's going on now?:** So, there a few things I'm having major anxiety about. I know that I screwed up by behaving that way and I didn't consider the impact on another person because it isn't a personal trigger or boundary of mine if the intent is clear, despite us having similar experiences. I get that I ignorantly over-stepped his boundaries, which isn't an excuse at all for how I made someone feel. I feel incredibly guilty. I don't know if I made it clear that the apology is genuine, or if I made my intent clear without delegitimizing his experiences or what he was saying or how he was feeling. 

I know that making someone feel that way is basically unforgivable, but I'm now also having major anxieties about fixing it.

I was speaking to a friend about it and they told me I've behaved in similar ways with them and they've never interpreted it as me being angry or malicious and have always seen it for what it was, but I know that's not an excuse for how I made this guy feel.   
I've started wondering if ***I'm*** actually an abuser and that all the experiences I've had in my relationships have been caused by me behaving in this way and blindly hurting people (even if that wasn't my intention), and that what I've had done to me has been a retaliation or some kind of comeuppance for acting out of line and my brain wants to lock out the memories of it actually being my fault or me being the instigator.   
I don't remember ever hitting first, but I can be pretty nasty verbally when I'm stressed. For example, when I was pregnant my boyfriend at the time drank a lot and I told him he needed to grow up, start acting like he was going to be a father and stop being such a waste of space. I think I called him an idiot (or perhaps a swearier/nastier version) for using my money to buy ham and alcohol (vegetarian, pregnant - neither of those things were of any use to me). Being beaten and attacked has been a recurring pattern, and at some point, I need to question whether it's because I'm causing it by acting thoughtlessly.  As an aside, I ended up miscarrying so there isn't a child in the equation for me.

Another friend thinks I'm catastrophising the date/outcome and thinking in black and white terms because of my anxiety, but I really don't know if they're just trying to calm me down so think I need some insight from strangers.

**Final questions:** 

Was my apology acceptable? 

Is there anything else I should do to apologise? I know that's the end of that brief relationship, and I don't blame him or expect any other chances - I just hate feeling like something that was intentioned so differently was interpreted in such a drastically different way and that I caused trauma for someone else.

Do you think it's likely that I'm catastrophising, or is it more likely that I am the one to blame for all of the other relationship problems I've had? -&gt; if you need more context, feel free to ask, I just feel that this post is super long already.",hystericalsalad,2020-01-22 05:44:19,0,1434,12.34,15.09,89.06,22.53,22.76,16.81,93.44,62.55,23.29,15.48,11.3,0.28,1.88,1.81,0.21,7.81,5.02,11.44,12.13,6.49,9.14,2.58,20.99,4.74,2.3,1.88,0.63,2.3,7.11,3.42,3.63,0.56,1.74,0.49,8.79,0.21,0.77,0,2.23,21.2,4.67,3.14,2.79,6.35,2.09,6.9,2.51,0.7,0.56,0.98,0.91,0.07,0.56,0.21,0.28,4.67,1.26,0.77,1.81,0.63,0.42,7.88,9.76,1.12,10.11,1.39,4.81,4.04,0.21,1.19,0,0.28,0,0.14,2.16,0.49,1.26,0.63,0.14,0.07,22.38,3.7,3.56,1.67,0.28,0.98,0.07,0.42,0.42,5.02,0.84,5.44

As an aside, I ended up miscarrying so there isn't a child in the equation for me.

Another friend thinks I'm catastrophising the date/outcome and thinking in black and white terms because of my anxiety, but I really don't know if they're just trying to calm me down so think I need some insight from strangers.

**Final questions:**

Was my apology acceptable?

Is there anything else I should do to apologise? I know that's the end of that brief relationship, and I don't blame him or expect any other chances - I just hate feeling like something that was intentioned so differently was interpreted in such a drastically different way and that I caused trauma for someone else.

Do you think it's likely that I'm catastrophising, or is it more likely that I am the one to blame for all of the other relationship problems I've had? -&gt; if you need more context, feel free to ask, I just feel that this post is super long already.",hystericalsalad,2020-01-22 06:06:54,5,1488,12.25,14.87,89.2,21.64,23.62,16.67,93.41,62.37,23.12,15.39,11.36,0.27,1.81,1.75,0.2,7.73,4.97,11.42,12.23,6.52,9.21,2.55,21.1,4.64,2.28,1.95,0.6,2.22,7.06,3.36,3.63,0.54,1.68,0.47,8.6,0.2,0.74,0,2.15,21.3,4.77,3.29,2.76,6.38,2.08,6.72,2.49,0.67,0.54,1.01,0.87,0.07,0.54,0.2,0.27,4.5,1.21,0.74,1.75,0.6,0.4,7.93,9.95,1.14,10.08,1.34,4.77,4.1,0.2,1.14,0,0.27,0,0.13,2.08,0.47,1.21,0.6,0.13,0.07,22.04,3.7,3.56,1.68,0.13,0.94,0.07,0.47,0.4,5.04,0.81,5.24
esclkv,Hit me after I self harmed,"Okay, so I'm just looking for help to digest a situation.

My boyfriend of 5 years and I get into a fight the other day. Things always get personal. The fight came from nowhere and ended in him putting me down (this is normal for us). When he speaks to me the way he does I get very angry my heart starts to race and I get hysterical. The things he says wind me up so much in the past I have have screamed, punched walls, banged my head off things.. this night I was so hysterical with how useless and awful he made me feel, I went into the bathroom, broke one of his razors and cut myself. Two deep ones on my leg and one accidental chunk out of my finger. I can't really remember much of me actually doing it or what I said to him but I just remember him hitting me once across the face.. i don't remember the pain only the feeling of shock that he hit me. I woke up and there was a bruise and cut on my face.

I'm just gonna say I have only tried to cut myself once before and this was also as a result of an argument with him. I stopped myself that time and never thought about it again!

He has never put his hands on me ever. I do feel like the way he talks to me does count as emotional abuse and I just don't know what to do. 

I love him every bit of him and we have two children together.",Lostgal92,2020-01-22 06:21:36,7,274,26.06,27.97,90.4,1,16.12,9.12,94.53,63.14,24.82,20.07,13.87,0.73,0,5.47,0,4.74,5.47,13.87,6.57,7.66,8.03,2.19,17.88,3.65,1.82,1.46,2.55,1.46,6.93,0.73,5.84,0,1.82,0.73,11.68,0,0.36,0,5.84,8.39,2.92,1.09,0,0.36,2.19,2.19,4.38,0.36,1.82,2.19,3.65,2.55,0.73,0,0.36,6.2,2.19,0.36,2.19,1.46,0.36,6.2,9.85,0.36,15.33,1.82,6.93,6.57,0,0.36,0.36,0,0,0,0.73,0,0.36,0.36,0,0,10.95,6.2,1.82,0,0,0,0.36,0,0,1.82,0.73,0
ese25y,Please read this I need help,"Hi 

I have been in an abusive relationship since I was 19 I am now 22.

I am terrified for my life. I cant get rid of him. I have tried breaking up but he wont let me. I used to live with him but moved out when the neighbour knocked on door, he made me answer the door and that was the first time I have ever told someone what was happening. She encouraged me to call police but people don't understand he has a dog and cat and I don't want to look after them if he goes to prison, plus I doubt the police will even believe me. Anyway. he has pulled me down stairs, dragged me across floor by my hair and strangled me many times. He used to like to push me in bath with hand around my neck and turn cold shower on. He tried to drown me in bath once. Police were called by neighbours in house we previously lived in but I lied and honestly this is the worst mistake, bar meeting this pathetic piece of shit, of my life. They took me away and asked if something was wrong and I so so so wanted to tell them but my stupid brain still loved this abusive arsehole so I couldn't do it. I got the feeling they knew I wasn't being truthful. He was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer when they came to the house for around the 8th time. I had to go to court with him. I didn't lie under oath, I didn't see him hit the police officer, but I just wish I told them what was happening to me.

He told me he was going to change, so last week moved into a flat. I wasn't on the tenancy for this house, as the other 2 house we lived in he had damaged so much I was sick. Anyway, back to the flat. He hasnt changed at all. I had to escape today and now I am sitting in my dads house (where i live now) terrified. I am writing this because he knows where I live. Im scared. I am waiting to hear his car pull up outside, for him to slam the door and kick the door down like he has threatened. I have a set of keys to his new flat and I still have them and this is what it is all about - he wants the keys back, and I am far too scared to see him again. Im terrified please someone help me I cant even tell you how scared I am i cant see my eyes are dripping. i told him to ring police and i would give the keys to them or to ring the police and ill meet him with the police present i dont know what to do. 

He was in care and blames this on his mother who was abusice towards him as a child also blames it on autism but ive had autistic boyfriend before and he wasnt like this.please help i have schizophrenia and i dissosiate a lot with abuse and i cant help myself i cant tell my dad, my dad will go afyer him and im scared my ex boyfriend will hurt him hes a very dangerous person.

We went yesterday and he requested an adjournment for a lawyer so now it’s delayed until Feb 5
I was shaken but I stayed in another room I was really hoping it would be over but now we have to wait 
He had a week to request this adjournment And it bothers me why he waited
He has no income for a lawyer.

More time to hurt.

Anyway I told my boss about it and he that I needed to just block him on everything and if he comes after you then get a restraining order. So today my boss and I were talking and he kept looking at me like I was a dumbass because I was still texting him once a day. There is no one more I respect in the world than my boss, so when we got done talking I realized ‘wow what the hell have I been doing all this time’  He’s physically, sexuality, and verbally abused me and yet I still somewhat cared about him.

esl3w7,"I need any kind of outside advice I can get , I’m being abused by a youtuber.","This is my first time reaching out to anyone about my situation or really telling anyone what’s going on . 
It all started in the beginning of my relationship June 2019 I had gotten into a really bad fight with my boyfriend and in the heat of the moment we decided to end things. I had a friend come pick me up and that was that. That night I ended up drinking with a close friend of mine and venting . I had gotten a little too drunk I guess and had texted one of my ex boyfriends. My friend ends up dropping me off (I didn’t remember till I woke up in my own bed) that’s when I realize my boyfriend was still there . I woke up to him going through my phone , he angrily confronted me about it . I apologized and tried to explain I was black out drunk , we also consensually broke up the night before. Truthfully haven’t seen this kind of anger before , he got so hostile after my apology he threw my own belongings around in the room we were in and made a hole in my wall . In that moment I didn’t think much of it besides I made him this upset and I kept blaming myself for all the anger. Ever since then we’ve been fighting extremely. Name calling , I’ve been hit once now and My house looks like a museum for angry emotions with all the holes in the walls , doors , closet sliding doors are smashed in. The worst part of all of this is he is someone with a large social media following , so he has gotten people to harass me / send me threatening messages. Regardless of his non-stop verbal abuse he still continues to live in my home . I’ve tried talking with him , deleting my own social media but it seems like anything I do I can’t come back from that night . He will mention that night anytime I try to talk to him about any of my feelings . He’s recently gone as far as to smash my dads altar (I’m pagan) and tell me I’m not allowed to grieve my friend who recently died because he took his own life because we flirted over 4 years ago . 
I feel like I’m lost , I feel ugly and I feel alone .
Do I really deserve all of this because of that night . I didn’t even remember talking to the person . I feel like this is taking a huge toll on my mental heath . I feel numb .",TrainingSuggestion3,2020-01-22 16:34:57,3,438,46.58,39.19,98.01,1,19.04,13.47,94.29,57.99,23.74,18.04,13.47,1.14,0,3.42,0,5.71,4.34,16.44,7.99,4.57,5.25,1.37,20.09,3.42,2.74,0.68,1.14,2.05,5.02,0.23,4.57,0.46,2.97,0.91,13.47,0.23,1.6,0,4.34,12.33,2.97,1.83,0.68,2.97,1.83,2.51,2.28,0.68,0.23,1.37,1.14,0,0.46,0,0.68,10.73,4.34,1.14,2.97,1.6,0.91,9.13,9.82,0.91,18.49,2.05,8.68,7.99,0,0.91,1.6,0,0.46,0.46,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,12.33,5.25,2.28,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,3.42,0.91,0.23
esljmp,My boyfriend(24) and I(26) got physical..long story short he held me down pysically for 30 mins so I can’t do anything and I hit him first to get out of his arms. Yes I hit him first...,"TL;DR AT BOTTOM 

First of all, english is my second language.. please understand

I and my boyfiend was fighting because he broke my permission.
I didn’t let him look through my photos on my phone

And I explained why. It’s because I have so many pictures of me .. and some of them can be embarrassing to show someone.. and some screenshots that I took when I was learning english can be embarassing as well ..(I know it’s not something embarrasing but for me it can be)

But he looked through while I was taking a shower.

And I didn’t know that there was some pictures of my ex. But yes.. there were..
I deleted most of them.
But I’ve used my phone for like three years,
I have too many pictures of anything.. my puppy, my famlily, myself, my friends, random memes,,and so on
So, I couldn’t delet every picture of my ex 
I mean I thought I did.. 
everytime I found pictures of him, I deleted right away.
But he found some. It was picture in june, 2018
.. I said sorry and I didn’t know there was that pic.
But he kept asking why there was that pic over and over.
I already answered and got mad because he broke my permission.
And english is my second language so I can’t speak english when I’m mad.. my brain doesn’t work properly for english
So I told him I already answered and I don’t understand why you broke my permission, and I’m upset so I can’t talk right now.
But he forced me to talk physically holding me down for 30mins( because he wants to talk about it and make up right away. I understand that)
It made me so frustrated and I just wanted to get out of his arms (he holding me down hurts me and it got me bruise on my wrists)
So I said stop more than like 100 times..
After all.. yes I hit him first.. just to get out of his arms
And he hit me back too.. 
after he hit my head so hard , it ended

I’m too sad right now.
What can make us better..?
Or is it just hopeless..?
Am I really the abuser? If so I’ll just say sorry to him.

TL;DR: he saw my phone while I was taking a shower. And he found some pics of my ex. (I thought I deleted them all I swear) so we fought . And he held me down for like 30mins.

My dad was choking the crap out of my mom. She passed out, I thought she's was dead.

et2ja1,Have you recovered from your trauma? (apologies if this doesn't fit the sub),"Hey yall,

I'd love to get your thoughts on a mental health awareness campaign I've been working on for the past year. If you're interested in participating, even better.

**WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE?**

***The news is killing people.***

When we lost Robin Williams the suicide rate increased by 10%. Marilyn Monroe: 12%. When Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain committed suicide, the hotline got 25% more calls. It's called *suicide contagion,* and it’s the proven link between mass media coverage of suicide and an increase in suicide rates.

Think about it. If a celebrity with more resources and success couldn’t beat it, how can anyone? It makes you feel hopeless. And hopelessness can be deadly.

With suicide rates increasing across the world, we have to do something now more than ever. Something unprecedented. We have to tell the other side of the story. Where people survive and thrive. We have to #ReportSurvival.

***#ReportSurvival***

\#ReportSurvival is a campaign guiding news organizations to report suicide more responsibly. Whether it’s Buzzfeed, the local news, or CNN, we’ll create a media landscape where a story of someone who survived suicide follows every report of someone who didn't.

**WHY SURVIVOR STORIES?**

***Why survivor stories?***

For every person that dies by suicide, another 280 people survive. Many of whom go on to live happy, fulfilling lives. These stories of survival and perseverance hold extraordinary power. That's why they're an effective way to end suicide contagion. But don't take it from us, take it from them:

“Portraying suicide survivors rather than focusing on completed cases in the media is more effective in reducing suicide contagion.”

* *Madelyn Gould, professor of clinical epidemiology at Columbia University and expert in youth suicide*

“Our best answers as to why suicides happen and what we can do to prevent them are not found by focusing on the one person who died by suicide, but by focusing on the living—the other 280 who survived.”

* *John Draper, Ph.D., executive director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline*

“It turns out that, although suicide can be contagious, resilience can also be contagious. And when we look at media reports that talk about people who thought about suicide but instead got help and got better, that actually rates across the population, the number of deaths that happen in a specific area, go down. And we really really want to encourage people to report in that kind of way.”

* *Mark Sinyor, M.D., Clinical Researcher and Professor at the University of Toronto*

“Hearing stories from people who have survived suicide attempts is an important step in suicide prevention.”

* *Professor Patrick McGorry, former Australian of the Year for his services to youth mental health*

“Their stories are not only enlightening professionals who create policies or study the subject, but they are also transmitting all important hope to those at risk.""

* *Center for Suicide Prevention*

""People see stories all the time about those surviving breast cancer, heart disease, and stroke, and we know what that recovery looks like—it helps people who are experiencing it or someone whose mom just got diagnosed. So many people go through their suicidal crisis feeling completely isolated and alone because they think they're the only ones. But they're not. There are millions of healing and recovery stories—they just haven't been shared.""

* *Shelby Rowe, a youth suicide prevention program manager for the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services*

***Don’t survivor stories already exist?***

When was the last time you saw an uplifting news story about someone who overcame suicide? Unfortunately, it’s human nature to take an interest in conflict, drama, and tragedy. As a result, the few survivor stories that are independently produced are unpromoted and low quality.

Of the content that does exist, ours will be different in several crucial ways:

1. ***Relevance*** \- Instead of one or two, we’ll feature 20 unique stories. This ensures every sufferer, no matter their experience, has something they can relate to.
2. ***Quality*** \- We’ve worked with award-winning production companies, many of whom are interested in pro-bono work. That means we’ll have the best equipment, crews, and directors to deliver quality films that distinguish our stories and engage our viewers.
3. ***Compelling Content*** \- We’ve learned storytelling at some of the world’s most renown advertising agencies and news organizations. Given our experience, we’re confident we can create films that are enthralling, concise, and effective.
4. ***Understanding*** *–* We understand these issues because we’ve been victims of them. Whether it’s suicide, suicide contagion, or depression, the videos we’re creating are films we wish existed when we felt lost and hopeless.
5. ***Casting*** \- Finding the right people is essential. Without a good story, we don’t have a film worth making. That’s why we won’t proceed until we’re completely satisfied.
6. ***Link to Treatment*** \- This is about more than hope. It’s about action and lasting change. That’s why we’re putting emphasis on how suicide survivors got through it, giving concrete examples of how others can too. Each film will link to treatment options and affordable resources to help people take the next step and get the help they so desperately need.

**HOW WILL THIS WORK?**

For this to work, we need news organizations to see these survivor stories and make a commitment to #ReportSurvival. Here’s why it will happen:

1. ***It’s nothing new:*** Media guidelines for how to report suicide already exist. The most effective being the suicide prevention hotline. Problem is, suicide contagion is only getting worse. This makes #ReportSurvival a simple, yet essential evolution of these guidelines.
2. ***We made it simple:*** We'll make the survivor films ourselves. All they’ll have to do is link to the film. That's one line of text alongside the suicide prevention hotline number. It’s that easy.
3. ***Broadcast quality:*** Our films will be as compelling and well produced as any broadcast segment.
4. ***Variety:*** With 20 different films, news outlets won’t have to worry about covering the same story.
5. ***Pre-launch partnership:*** We’ll partner with a news organization beforehand. When we launch they'll pledge to #ReportSurvival, which ensures others will follow.
6. ***PR:*** A well-executed PR plan is essential. In the absence of one, our survivor stories will get lost in a clutter of internet content. Our experience pitching blogs and acquiring earned media will ensure people and news organizations won’t miss our efforts.
7. ***Legitimacy:*** Along the way, we'll get endorsements from mental health organizations like NAMI and influencers like Michael Phelps.
8. ***They already care:*** Unlike the rest of the world, reporters are well aware of suicide contagion. #ReportSurvival is a chance for them to help end a life or death issue they’re painfully aware of.

With that, let’s go over how this works executionally.

1. ***Pre-Launch: The Stories***

***Casting***

First things first. We’ll partner with a casting agency to help us find the most moving survivor stories. At the same time, we’ll tap into our own networks to cast an even wider net.

***Production***

To ensure viewers have a story they can relate to, we'll produce 20 films. Each will represent a different gender, sexuality, race, age, trauma, or treatment. That means 300 million people who’re suffering from depression will finally have access to stories they can relate to.

***Partnerships***

The more help we can get the better. Whether it’s non-profits with funding, individuals with feedback, or production partners with time and equipment, we’ll take whatever we can get.

2) ***Pre-Launch: #ReportSurvival***

***Influencers***

Although it’s not essential, influencers have helped spark some of the most successful social movements in the digital age. Movements like #MeToo, Obama’s “Change” campaign, and the Ice Bucket Challenge dominated the internet because of influencer support.

Given this issue's importance, our connections, and how unaware people are, we believe we can recruit some of the world’s most influential people. Celebrities with their own survivor stories in all areas of life. Oprah, Michael Phelps, Ted Turner, Prince Harry, and J.K. Rowling are just a few examples of influencers who are just as passionate as we are.

***Bring on the News***

As proven with the existing suicide guidelines when one news organization commits to change, the rest join. Doesn’t matter if it’s Fox News or MSNBC, they all want to help end suicide contagion. So as we previously mentioned, we’ll partner with an organization beforehand.

3) ***Launch***

***Wait for it***

Every high profile suicide has lead to record-breaking global awareness, but very little action or change. By launching our campaign in reaction to the next widely publicized high profile suicide, we’ll turn awareness into action.

**WHO ARE WE?**

***I’m Tim***

I spent the last 6 years working at Ogilvy &amp; Mather. While there, I executed campaigns for American Express, British Airways, Coke Zero, ThinkPad, and Qualcomm.

I know what it's like to feel hopeless. I know suicide contagion exists because I was almost a victim of it. And I know how discouraging it is to see countless stories of people who gave up, but none of the people who beat it.

That’s why this isn’t something I *want* to do. This is something I *will do*.

***The Agency***

My digital media company GUSH specializes in social media campaigns and PR-worthy executions. Part of our business is applying our digital, social, and PR skills to end the mental health crisis.

He then started grabbing my head and started punching my head insanely. I grabbed him by the nuts and i was trying to get him off me, flailing my arms around. I felt blood gushing everywhere on my head and i felt it go all the way down my chest and torso, once he realized i was bleeding, he looked at me ( I was on the floor ) and had a “oh shit “ type of look on him and then he ran out. He has beeen arrested for hitting me before, I got up called 911 and locked my door. He called 911 too. When the cops asked me what happened I was in shock and all i could say is “i dont know” the ambulance checked me out and i did not go to hospital cause i do not have health insurance. There was a big gash on my head, bruised on my neck, and a swollen head. I called my mom to come over because i was all alone. They wouldn’t allow her to come in.  I finally came to my senses and told the cops what had happened. Next thing I know, the cops come back inside and ARREST ME for domestic violence. They said “There are scratches on his neck” and all i could say is “Do you not see my face???” I was arrested and taken to jail. I did not lay a hand on him other than trying to get him off of me.

et97tx,My (30) boyfriend (44) has been verbally abusive and in my face. Is this going to escalate and get physical? I'm scared and I feel frozen.,"TL;DR on the bottom.

Please forgive the wonky formatting, I'm writing this in the bathroom on my phone with shakey hands.  

This morning at 4:30 my boyfriend began yelling at me right in my face. He is a big guy and it was really loud. Telling me all the different ways in which I am not enough. He goes into work at 6:00 am and I get up with him and make his breakfast and pack him a lunch. I'm an early riser and I love preparing food for him (at least I used to). He used to be super gracious and praise me on his fabulous homemade packed lunches and creative breakfasts. He told me about how all the guys at work were jealous of his lunch It made me feel good. 

But not this morning. Today at 4:45 he told me ""Frittata again? And what are you packing me for lunch? Remember I work overtime. Did you know when I open my lunch bag I've been disappointed as many times as I've been delighted? I give so much more than I get from you!"" 

I said that wasn't cool of him to say and that I don't have to do this for him, I choose to and that's when he completely went off the rails on numerous tangents about many things are wrong with me - at full screaming volume right in my face. 

This is not the first time he has done this. He rarely apologizes. It feels like more and more he's testing the waters to see what else I'll take. He always ""love bombs"" me after a while, praising me and all that I do with the vernacular of a poet, and I forget these moments when he sprays me with venom.

I can't move out and I can't kick him out, he and his daughter (8) live in my apartment and don't have resources to move. His daughter calls me mommy (her bio mom is absentee) I've got two young daughters that I have shared custody of. This is my weekend with them but after this morning I feel like this could possibly escalate further and I don't know if my kids should be around? I'm scared and feel so powerless. He really made me feel so worthless today. I feel physically weak from it. 


TL;DR:

After screaming in my face at 4:30 am about how the breakfasts and lunches I prepare for him are not good enough I am scared that this pattern indicates that he will eventually get physical. It's my apartment, I can't move. I feel so stuck and scared.",babyspiceweasel,2020-01-24 03:33:54,43,470,19.52,29.73,78.55,25.77,14.69,13.4,91.7,58.51,24.68,18.72,12.13,0,0.64,5.74,0.21,5.96,3.19,12.77,9.79,4.04,8.09,2.34,19.36,6.81,3.19,1.7,2.77,2.13,6.38,3.19,3.19,1.06,0.64,0.43,11.91,1.06,0.85,1.28,6.38,9.57,2.77,1.7,0.64,0.43,1.06,3.4,4.04,0.21,1.49,2.34,5.11,1.06,1.49,0,2.13,6.6,1.06,1.91,1.91,1.7,0.21,4.47,14.68,1.28,13.83,1.7,7.23,5.11,1.7,0.43,0.64,0.21,0,0,0.21,0,0,0.21,0,0,16.6,5.53,1.28,1.06,0.43,1.06,0.21,0.21,0.85,3.83,2.13,0

It would be especially hard to talk to someone face to face about  what I’m about to type now.

   
   During my relationship with my abuser, I was-on multiple occasions-forced to have sex against my will. Sometimes he’d talk me into doing it even when I told him that I wasn’t in the mood. Other times, he would physically force himself on me. Once, I voiced that he was hurting me one night and he told me that I needed to just take the pain. It made me feel like nothing more than a sex object.

etm7g2,"Left for the second time, PTSD, feeling hopeless","I got out of an domestic abusive relationship for the last time a few weeks ago. He was arrested in May, and I got back together with him and stood up for him in court, and we got back together in September after not speaking for months. He was going through treatment and I thought he was getting better, but in mid - December he ended up getting drunk and beating me up with a belt and punching my in the face repeatedly. This sort of violence was worse than what he’d put me through the first time.

I feel so much worse this time around, maybe because it’s the winter and I struggle with staying positive during the winter. When we had broken up previously, I felt better, was focused on my own healing, had more motivation. This time around it feels so much worse. I am disassociating, lashing out at people I love, pushing people away, failing at work and not doing as well in classes and school. I’ve forgotten the progress I made from May-September and just feel completely hopeless. I feel isolated and so ashamed and I’m turning to alcohol which makes me feel so much worse. After I drink I turn into this depressed zombie where I call out of work for days, sleep for 22 hours of the day, and eat cereal and cry.

I saw a therapist over the summer and have called her twice since this went down and she hasn’t gotten back to me. I feel like a burden and just so perpetually exhausted and sad. 

Has anyone else gone through this after breaking up for a second time? How long until I feel better? Is this PTSD? 

TL;DR: Broke up with my abuser for the second time and am having a much worse time healing. Can’t tell if I’m experiencing symptoms of PTSD.",madalenka222,2020-01-24 20:37:28,3,322,64.26,33.19,98.13,1,16.95,16.15,94.72,55.9,15.22,11.49,8.07,0.62,0,2.8,0,3.73,5.28,17.39,6.83,5.59,9.63,1.24,18.63,5.59,4.66,1.55,1.86,1.86,8.7,2.48,6.21,0.62,0.62,2.48,6.83,0,0,0.62,2.17,9.63,3.42,1.86,0.31,1.86,0.62,2.48,3.73,0.31,0.31,2.8,4.04,0.62,2.17,0,1.24,12.73,1.86,2.8,4.66,3.11,1.86,7.45,9.01,0.93,22.67,2.17,10.56,11.18,1.86,0.93,0.31,0,0,0.31,0.31,0,0,0,0.31,0,13.35,4.66,4.35,0.31,0.31,0.93,0,0.62,0,2.17,0,0

etu7p3,Co-Worker is being abused and I have proof,"Hey guys- I am not sure what to do in this situation. A coworker of mine has been with her BF for two years now (both in their late 20s). He has never been nice. Cheats all the time, calls her names, not affectionate etc. Recently they have decided to move in together. My coworker comes from a background of childhood sexual abuse and has really low self esteem. She has no close family and no friends outside work. Her boyfriend pays her rent and for her food. He drives her everywhere and is her only way to get around. She doesn't come out with us much for work parties because her BF doesn't want to drive her/tells her that she is slutty when he isn't around and doesn't trust her- so he is very controlling of her and tries to isolate her.

In the last two months this escalated. He began calling her a slut and a whore and telling her that he wants to kill her and wishes he could strangle her. He has also punched walls and doors near her when arguing and blows up for no reason. I am the only one she tells this to because she trusts me. I have tried to talk to her about it as abuse without telling her flat out ""you have to leave him"" because I don't want her to stop telling me things and isolate herself with him.

Last night I got a text from her at 5:20am that said ""(BF) tried to kill me tonight. I am safe. please don't tell anyone. I am safe."" along with the text was a picture of her mirror selfie style in a bathroom with a robe on. She has blood on her face, tears and boogers running down her face, and red marks all along her chest and neck. I responded when I woke up and asked her where she was and she hasn't answered. Its been hours. I don't know what to do. If I call it might put her in more danger. I don't know if I should tell someone. I have the text proof of what happened. Please help.

eu083d,Update,"Idk who's seen my last couple posts I made but I finally left. Today I was supposed to work 9-4 but I called the office and told them I've been in an abusive relationship and needed to get out and she excused me at noon, told me do what I gotta do. My bf wasn't at the house and I had all my clothes, my laptop, my ds, and so much of my art supplies over there. I went up to the police station and asked them to come to the house with me just in case and they told me they would have to have his permission and him be on the property for them to come along. So my parents and I went over to his house without the helpless fucking cops and we got all my shit out of there and went straight to the phone company to change my number. And I have gotten a few new accounts he made on snapchat try to add me but otherwise he cant get ahold of me. He doesnt know my new number, and I have no other social medias because he made me delete them all. So I blocked his new snapchats he made. And now I'm just chilling at home with my parents. The good feeling of leaving is starting to disappear and now it's starting to sink in. Him and I have this weird spiritual connection in a way that's hard to explain because hes been cumming inside of me ever since the first time we've had sex and we are both spiritual people. But I have been feeling him thinking and obsessing over me.. and I can feel his sadness and feelings in a way. But I can also feel his anger he has towards me. So I dont have the desire to go back, but this is the first night in 7 months I'm sleeping alone after having him by my side every night. Its gonna be hard. And what sucks even more is its gonna suck for a while... I just feel really sad it had to end this way, I didnt get any closure because the last time I saw him I didnt even have the thought of leaving him in my head. I just thought up this idea at work this morning and took action. And it needed to happen, I'm not saying it didnt need to happen. But this is going to be a really hard couple of days and I need the support and strength anywhere I can find it. Please give me advice on how to stay busy enough to where I wont unblock him on snapchat or do something stupid. I'm trying to stay away from drinking any alcohol too because I'm a recovered alcoholic and I dont wanna refrain back to my old ways because of this situation. But I want a fucking drink so bad.

eu2nkp,Violent girlfriend,"Ok so I am in my 3rd serious relationship, I’m a F25 et he M25 and the thing is that I have anger issues I am very impatient and he’s very patient. A lot of tiny things get me angry and I start being violent and then I get over it but only if I beat him or objects. The problem is that I’m scared that he’ll see it as a humiliation and won’t love me anymore because that’s what happened with my second relationship. I was violent with the first one too but it was justified because he cheated and I left him after that. What I’m saying is that I am violent but not that violent meaning that it’s not a big deal yk. I’m a woman and I have the straight of a woman and the things is that I am scared he feels humiliated and will lose love for me but all I want is him to change some behaviors even if they’re meaningless they are important to me, like listening to me without cutting me off or washing the dishes properly. Also I’m scared he’ll reply with violence one day because in that case I won’t be able to control myself and it might be dangerous. Because men can’t be violent towards women that’s a fact. A man is a man. At the same time I want to stop being violent but I don’t know how, it’s litterally the only way I calm down yk.

eui7s5,Anger management/ Batterer intervention,"Has anyone ever pushed therapy on their SO? Did it end up helping?

Background - we have lived together since Feb. 2017. There have been three occasions at which things have sort of gotten physical but not quite. Once where he slapped a bottle out of my hand, once where he jerked a couch cushion out from behind my head and then today where he just followed me to every room, pushed himself against me and screamed and yelled at me that I needed to “listen to him”. Today was by far the worst.. 

I told him he needed to go to anger management and he agreed but hours later told me he could work on himself by himselfZ I feel now it’s two battles. One just to get him to see he has a problem and then to actually try to get help for that problem.

eurrlh,His parents are siding with him,"His parents are going to every length possible to save their son from jail. They are pulling the dirtiest tactics.

They continually lied to police and kept changing their story. They paid the 1,000 dollar bail withinf three hours of his arrest. They are trying to find anything to frame me even though I am the one with bruises on my ribs and chest. He may have bruises on his shins and ankles, but I couldn't not fight back? I fought the best I could to save myself, but any attempt was always futile and I always got overpowered. They threatened me over his phone saying “hold her down for me until I get to her”.

euso9z,"Hi everyone, I’m currently undergoing a university assignment to do with ‘how far can children be said to be affected by domestic violence?’ I would really appreciate hearing off anyone who has been a victim of domestic violence as a child and would be willing to talk to me about their experiences.","I understand that this is a very sensitive topic area, so I’m obviously offering anonymity to anyone who gets in touch with me. Feel free to Dm me if you would rather speak privately. I wish to write a report that clearly highlights the extent that domestic violence has on a person growing up and so it would really help to hear someone’s experience and thoughts on the matter.

eut3cn,My girlfriend was physically attacked last night and i dont know how to help her,"Ok so this is all very fresh and I’m really angry about this but I will try to keep it as coherent as possible. 

My girlfriend was in an argument with her step dad last night, and he tried to kick her out(he co-owns the house with her mom, who makes a majority of the income). This is not the first time something like this has happened, its his go to move when he’s angry with her. She was outside with no shoes or phone, and wanted to go back inside to get her phone. She couldn’t find it and went to use her laptop to use the ‘find my iphone’ service. While she is doing this, her step dad is yelling at her to get out of the house and that she isn’t allowed to have her phone.

He then tries to take her laptop from her, which she resists. He keeps trying to grab it from her and then pushes her to the ground, twisting her ankle and bruising her leg. He then grabs her laptop and throws it. She still wants to find her phone so she tried to pickup her laptop, which he snatched up before she had a chance to get it. As shes trying to get it from him he throws her to the side again. Her mom is watching the whole thing and is just freaking out. Eventually things calmed down enough where my gf could get her phone, and her mom was going to take her to a hotel for the night so they didnt have to be there.

So now my girlfriend doesnt know if she can go back home. Her step dad is very controlling of her mother and has kicked her out in the past. She doesn’t know what to do and she feels that because her injuries aren’t visibile or extreme that she wont be taken seriously if she tries to report this. Can someone give me advice so i can help her?",ineedadvice_12,2020-01-27 11:39:11,4,352,15.87,90.42,1,6.67,19.56,8.52,97.44,65.62,25,18.18,2.84,0,0,15.06,0.28,6.82,3.98,14.49,10.23,5.97,9.38,2.84,22.73,2.27,1.42,1.99,0.28,0.85,2.27,0.28,1.99,0,1.42,0,21.88,1.99,1.14,13.35,3.69,10.51,2.27,1.99,1.7,3.12,0.28,2.84,2.84,0.28,1.7,0.85,1.42,1.14,0.57,0,0,7.95,1.7,2.27,2.27,2.27,0,3.98,16.19,2.27,13.35,3.69,4.55,5.68,1.99,0.28,0.85,0.28,0,0,0.85,0.28,0.28,0.28,0,0,10.51,4.55,2.56,0,0,0.28,0,0.28,0.28,1.99,0.57,0

ev099j,Looking for a way out,"-
Okay, so basically me and my boyfriend/father of my baby girl has become very toxic. It started when I was pregnant but I stayed out of fear of having to go through birth and everything alone. I thought that when the baby got here itd be different. It’s not though. If anything it feels like it’s getting worse. I don’t want to be with him anymore but we have a 4 month old daughter and he’s very controlling. Everytime I try to leave he shows up. He’s always been like that. Basically, I need to know the correct way to go about this so that it doesn’t become hostile. I need resources. I live in a states away from all my family except my dad. He works a lot so it’d be hard for him to take care of the baby. So until I can find a trusted person to watch my baby. I’m pretty much stuck. I have no source of income and don’t get any benefits besides wic. 

I’m scared that he’s going to try to take the baby. I stayed at my dads tonight and that was a argument and him calling repeatedly and saying he’s coming to get his daughter and that I can’t withhold him from her.",justcuriousox,2020-01-27 20:04:53,6,218,19.43,50,50.67,18.96,12.11,12.84,98.17,62.39,23.39,15.6,9.63,0.46,0,5.5,0,7.8,4.59,15.14,11.93,5.96,8.72,2.75,25.23,2.75,1.83,0.92,0.46,1.83,5.05,2.29,2.75,0.92,0.92,0.46,15.6,5.5,0.46,1.83,6.88,14.22,2.75,0.92,2.29,3.21,2.29,3.67,2.75,1.38,0.46,0.92,1.38,0,1.38,0.46,0,7.8,1.38,1.38,0.92,3.21,0.92,4.13,18.81,1.38,12.84,3.21,5.05,5.5,1.83,0.46,0.46,0.46,0,0,0.46,0,0,0.46,0,0,15.6,7.8,0.92,0,0,0,0,0.46,0,5.96,0,0.46

evep7z,Should I move or stay?,"This is a throwaway account -

I have been away from my abuser for almost a year and a half. Unfortunately, we still live in the same state, and we both frequent the same big city in that state, and I keep running into him or his friends. This makes me scared for my safety, Everytime I come across them I become paranoid. Did they see my car? My plates? Will he look up my new address and start stalking me? Will they start harassing me at my new job like they tried to at my old one?
I know I'm okay when I'm with other people, but I've been running into them when I'm alone. Tonight I nearly melted through the floor when I realized his friends were in a different section of the gym and had noticed me. This was the same friend that had harassed me at work, so I left immediately. Previously, I had run into my abuser at the hospital visiting my grandmother. I had to ride in an elevator with him and his new girlfriend twice because I am THE unluckiest person in the world. I felt like an animal trapped in a cage and I could tell he was basking in my inner panic. I've also run into him at Target a few times as well.
I want to move. I don't know how, I don't know where, but I want to be free of him once and for all. I want to feel the peace I feel when I travel and know he isn't going to pop out from around the corner and do something terrible to me. Never feel the fight or flight of seeing him again. 
My boyfriend wants to stay. Our friends and families are here, and he doesn't want to let him win. He thinks that I need to go to therapy for paranoia (which yes, I do but I don't have the time or the money) and that if I'm with him my abuser and his goonie friends will be too afraid to do anything. He also thinks that it's only a matter of time before my abuser ends up dead from an OD or in jail, so if I stick it out all my problems will probably go away.  Is it abnormal that I'm still afraid and want to essentially run away from the problem?

evvxt4,I am a concerned neighbor and former abuse victim who doesn't know what to do.,"I have lived in this apartment for nearly 3 months now. I have noticed now and again that one of my neighbors will yell every so often but it has never been as bad as it got today. I was asleep and woke up to the sound of screaming and loud thumping. I could clearly hear words and phrases, a woman's voice yelling ""why did you do it"" and calling someone terrible names, and it lasted for maybe 10 minutes. I ended up having flashbacks and hyperventilating but later encountered someone from that household outside. I have been informed the mom is bipolar and her behavior is treated by this person as just an unfortunate thing to live with. I feel incredibly distressed partly because of my own experiences and partly because I feel a young child is being abused in a household where the only other adult is complacent. I don't know what to do, if there even is anything I can or should do. But considering I come from a home where screaming and throwing furniture (chairs!) was routine, I feel an incredibly and overwhelming sense of needing to do something. Also this is my first Reddit post, sorry if I got anything wrong.  


tl;dr -- I overheard an adult being abusive to a child and I would like advice on what to do. No one ever helped me so I don't have any firsthand experience with this.

evxp2c,Need advice on domestic violence,"Hi reddit,

Created a spare account because I don't wish to be identified by my family. I'm in a bit of a situation now that I need some advice. I hesitate to go to a lawyer mainly because I don't know if it's a good idea to escalate things to that extent.

To give some background, my brother has a record of being violent and abusive. To give an example of physical violence, he would use dining chairs to hit us (the siblings), and had threatened to hit our parents a few times.

Today, he threw/hid my keys in the morning and prevented me from going to work. As a result, I'm unable to leave the house, and thanks to him removing all cooking utensils, I have no way to cook for myself either. Gonna have to survive on a bag of potato chips and water till 8\~9pm

Would anyone have any suggestions on how I should approach this? I had considered filing a police report a few times, but given that it happens within the family, there's very little evidence beyond bruising etc, I'm not sure if there's a case. Moreover, as a male, I'm not sure if the domestic violence protection applies to me. In addition, I'm also not sure if in the case today, it constitutes wrongful confinement given that I'm trapped in my own house. I intend to confront him tonight over his actions today, and am expecting it to turn violent. I'm still considering how I should deal with this situation, would appreciate any inputs.",Anon65123,2020-01-29 18:01:03,14,267,62.53,27.46,42.4,11.29,19.07,18.73,89.14,53.56,15.73,11.24,8.61,0.75,0,1.87,0,4.49,7.49,14.61,10.11,3.37,7.12,2.25,17.98,3.37,1.12,0.75,0.37,3.37,6.37,2.62,3.75,0.75,1.87,0,7.49,1.87,0,0,2.62,16.48,2.62,3,4.87,4.12,1.5,3.37,0,0,0,0,2.25,0,0.37,0,1.87,8.24,3,1.5,1.5,0.75,1.87,2.25,12.73,1.87,11.99,3.37,4.87,3.75,1.5,1.87,2.25,0.37,0,0,0.75,0,0.75,0,0,0,17.6,4.49,6.37,0,0,0.37,0,0,0,4.49,0.75,1.12

evzhyf,I need to help my best friend's GF (15F),"So about three months ago my best friend (16M) got a new girlfriend (soon to be 15)  and last night she told him that she's getting physically and emotionally abused by her mother and her dad who's in the military or something like that doesn't give a flip about what is happening.


Her mother's mom died at 16. Her dad's mom is the only one in her family that's actually pretty cool with her. My friend can't take her in his house due to his strict mother but I've offered to take them in mine so they can at least get a bit of privacy.

She told him a lot of horrible stuff about her past and current life but I'm not going to go into that, just going to call her mom less of a human being and more of an animal.

Another problem is that she has a sister that's about ~7 years old and she's the one getting beaten up and yelled up for days if her sibling lies about something while her sibling doesn't have any domestic violence trouble related to it.

We know that she's been beaten up since she was just a kid and all the abuse just increased with time, her mom would make her do stupid and gross things if she would cry. Last night specifically she laid on the floor while getting the belt so she wouldn't get bruises on her front parts and to make her mother stop quicker. The worst part of all of this is that she thinks what she's going through is normal and didn't try to seek out any help thinking that everyone was like her.

After her escaping her mom what we're afraid of are possible suicide attempts, using drugs, getting STIs, start smoking and getting drunk, and generally trying to live the life she never had.

ewjmkn,A letter to a Survivor,"Dear Survivor,

I know the pain you suffer. I’ve felt the words and strikes and manipulation you endure. I want you to know, you’re not alone. You are not weak. Or worthless. Pathetic. Needy, attention-seeking, or annoying. It is not your fault. And as hard as it is to hear, you can’t fix it...

But I want to share my story with you. So you can know what I’ve lived—the same life as you. So you can know I’ve feared and anguished and wept—the same ways as you. And so you can know that I’ve seen the end, reaching for that chance at a better life—the same hope as you.

My story begins with two text messages and a voicemail. Left in despair and anger, over the abuse that was done and a push for change. They were all he had against me, and he thought he’d won. He was sure he’d won. And I was too. But I had mountains of evidence, texts, calls, videos, and images to show he was a terrible abuser. However, none of it mattered except the three contacts I’d made paired with large, exaggerated claims and a charming, snake-oil salesman smile... so I had to learn a few hard lessons. He was still abusing me from afar. He had used the same tactics against me towards others to quickly gain their favor (and tout I was a “psycho cunt” who was mentally unstable and struggling with addiction) to all who would listen. And the justice system is bullshit.

My abusive ex, after ending our relationship two days after my 30th birthday vía an assault and text message, moved forward recently to file for a protective order because he “was in fear for his life”  regarding me. He *blatantly lied and falsified claims for police reports that nearly got me labeled a committer of Family Violence* (of which I had ample evidence that his timeline and claims are unfounded), and I was the one being abused! He did it to try and ensure I was made homeless because I would’ve been kicked out of my residence as mother owns a daycare in her, and my temporary, home, and it’s against state licensure to house a family “abuser”. And he knew I’d lose my teaching license for good due to another state law that is allowed to go executed without proper burden of proof.

But he failed to wrongfully label me his batterer and abuser in a court of law... 

He called multiple times to the cops, lying that I was committing crimes or wielding weapons for suicide attempts to try and get my marked insane, even though his abuse did make me want to commit suicide. I have half a dozen beat cops who agreed he was physically assaulting me at the very least, but not a single detective will return my calls so I can follow through with charges against him for domestic violence. He even erased the security camera footage (which I had copies of) from the dates I was abused on camera in the front yard or driveway to obstruct justice. 

But he will fail at preventing me from justice...

I’m out thousands of dollars for therapy and medication and multiple lawyers to fight this evil narcissist and his destruction. I’ve lost a home I co-own (name is on lease and title) against my will. I am having my credit ruined via unpaid bills for an AC unit he couldn’t get financing for (so it’s solely in my name but being used by him and household). He purposefully sent my boss a handwritten letter with reports outing me as being arrested for drug possession (planted—and all my drug screens/hair follicles prove I was clean for a period *prior* to the arrest of 90 days), as well as sharing my alcohol addiction struggles and mental health issues—and this cost me my job as well as future ones as an educator (and I can’t prove it was discrimination for them to do so). He is breaking our legally binding buyout agreement I was threatened into signing via multiple ways (some used police action), as well as failed to make my monthly payments agreed to so I can recoup the $13k I invested (alone, I later realized, as he actually put no money in our joint account) in buying our “dream home” that was to be made a rental income for us to split later down the road. 

But he failed to see me dejected and alone...

Financially ruined, in debt, nearly homeless, jobless, abused, reneged against, and severely depressed, I lay helplessly in a spare room at my parents in my bed—amidst walls of unpacked boxes and piles of belongings. I wanted this nightmare to end. I wanted him to suffer. But the saddest part? I wanted to die.

All of this he had done and is doing with no consequences... *YET.* The universe may see fit to right the wrongs, he may be his own demise, or I may be successful with my proceedings against him moving forward—and no matter what I had to accept it would be alright. When I wanted to scream and cry and claw my face up or tear my hair out in agony, *it was going to be alright* again.

And no matter what, he has failed to break me. No matter how hard and how far he is willing to push and stoop and scrape to force me down under his control again, he was going to fail...

In therapy today, I was told “if you survived the abuse, you *can* survive the recovery.” 

But even broken, jaded, untrusting of anyone’s ulterior motive, sick with anxiety and fear, unjustly done, or unsure of who someone really is within, I will *NOT* allow these wounds to be the end of me. 

I will *NOT* allow him the control of occupying my thoughts or plans or musings anymore.

I will *NOT* let him abuse me any longer. 

And just as I survived my abuse, I *WILL* survive my recovery—into a better life and self than I could ever have imagined without him before. 

The world may not be just or fair, but those of us who are survivors of abuse or neglect or toxicity, we have a choice: to stop the abuse, hard as it is, and move forward with letting go; to learn to self-love again; to say “no more” to being used or controlled or manipulated; to take charge of our lives; and to focus on our—and *only* our—healing. It’s a long, shitty, difficult road, but we can create our own justice—and that is living a life where we never focus on anything beyond ourselves, our loved ones, and our futures. While they continue to scheme and trick and connive, trapped in their cycle of misery, we are strong once again. And we are *free.* 💜 

Stay strong out there, for those of you who have exited a relationship and still struggle or those of you who have yet to find strength to leave. Know you always have someone to talk to for any reason, any time—just PM me, please. And find love and support to surround yourself with for all the ups and downs and in-betweens.

It’s together, united and introspective, supported and strong, that we survive our recovery: to a new life, a new future, and a new you. One deserving of love. And one worth everything and anything in the world. 💛🧡❤️💚💙💜",ELfit4life,2020-01-30 21:37:25,3,1269,45.7,53.47,39.38,1.51,19.83,16.47,90.46,57.13,17.97,13.87,6.93,1.58,1.65,3.31,0.39,4.1,4.89,14.42,8.83,3.31,10.01,1.65,14.74,5.36,2.68,1.26,0.95,1.5,9.46,3.15,6.23,0.79,2.21,2.05,10.72,0.32,0.16,0.16,3.23,12.14,2.13,2.21,1.1,2.92,1.26,4.26,1.5,0.47,0.47,0.47,2.52,0.16,2.05,0,0.08,10.09,2.84,2.52,4.18,0.95,1.26,5.2,7.64,1.42,10.48,1.58,5.04,4.33,2.29,0.55,1.18,1.42,0,0.32,0.71,0.24,0,0.16,0.24,0,18.28,6.07,5.36,0.16,0.32,0.08,0.08,0.39,0.95,1.58,1.42,1.89

This brought up a lot for me unexpectedly. I thought back to two times in my life when I have been strangled. The first was when I was at school and only a child, I laughed at a boy at school and he became angry pushed me up against a wall and strangled me. I told no one. 
The second time it was my brother, I had gotten angry over something and he was using the computer and I switched it off at the wall. He got angry and pushed me up against a wall and strangled me. I told no one. I was 15 at the time he was 17.

ewnmiu,My girlfriend is physically abused at her home,"Hello,

I'm in need of advice I really don't know what to do. My girlfriend (23) still lives with her parents and her brother (21?). 

Ever since she was little her parents began to hit her. As her brother got older he started hitting her as well. 

I don't want to go too much into details but nowadays the father doesn't hit her anymore (he's stopped alcohol) but he doesn't care when he sees the mother/brother trying to hit my GF. The mother drinks every day and blames her daughter for everything. 

Her brother is now 21ish and weights 85kg (~190lbs). He hits really hard. He also tries to strangle her every now and then. Normally he doesn't do all that shit when I'm around but one day I was there and I tried to defend her but he pulled a knife on me.

My GF doesn't want me to call the police since there'll be significant consequences (basically if police shows up she's gonna get jumped by all her family later on).

How can I help her? She wants me not to do anything before she get her own home so she can be save.

At the moment she works but earn less than minimum wage. I'm not working for now but I want to.

exaoz3,I think my brother is in an abusive relationship,"My brother is in his 30s, and lives with his girlfriend and their 6 year old daughter.

I recently moved about 300 miles away, so I'm not as able to be physically there as I'd like.

His girlfriend has always been really demanding - she works 2 half days a week, he works 6 days a week and has a good job as a chef. His girlfriend is incredibly untidy (as in, every room is piled with washing and rubbish, bags of receipts, old baby clothes etc) to the point I've not been in their house for over 3 years because they won't let anyone in. He spends most of his time off work tidying the house, and I know my parents have also helped really regularly. He's often mentioned that when he tidies up, she is verbally abusive. When I lived closer we used to take my neice swimming every week. His girlfriend would phone multiple times before, while we were there (after swimming he'd have multiple missed calls) and after, to check where he was, what he planned on doing when, and when he'd be home. 

Recently he's not been in contact much, but has started using WhatsApp to speak to me, because she has gained access to all his social media and regularly checks his phone. He chats to me for a few minutes then deleted the app because he's scared of her.

She threatens to leave him and take their daughter constantly so she gets her own way (I suspect this is usually financial). He's too scared to do anything because he doesn't want to lose his daughter. His girlfriend is originally from Hungary, and he is based in the UK. 

I don't know how to help or what to do, but he's told me he's scared and desperately unhappy.",milllllllk,2020-02-01 10:51:43,4,312,15.88,87.57,13.65,1.86,20.8,16.67,91.99,59.62,19.87,17.95,5.13,0.64,0,10.9,1.28,1.92,3.21,13.46,12.82,6.73,10.26,1.92,20.83,4.81,3.85,2.56,1.92,2.56,3.53,0.32,3.21,1.6,0.96,0.96,20.51,2.24,1.92,3.21,9.29,9.94,1.28,2.56,0.64,1.92,1.28,2.56,0.96,0,0.96,0,1.6,0.32,1.28,0,0,9.62,4.49,2.24,1.6,1.92,0.64,4.17,13.78,0.64,16.99,1.28,5.77,9.94,1.6,0.96,1.28,0.64,0,0,0.32,0,0.32,0,0,0,16.35,4.49,5.13,0,0,0,0,0.32,0,4.49,1.92,0

exlbzr,Advice on Domestic Violence - living with a parent (long story),"My story's a long one, but I'll cut it short as possible:

Y'see I'm adopted, the circumstances of why, because my biological mother almost beat me to death .. was jailed for it and then on the 2nd occurrence was forced into giving me up for adoption.

Later on, was adopted by this couple, seemed to take good care of me until I was 5 .. then started up abusing me again, pulling my hair, slapping me across the face if I didn't do something they approved of, even had my handheld games (y'know the LCD type with the button batteries .. those!) smashed if I didn't do something right ..

Anyway this kinda abuse continued over the years .. until my adoptive father passed away back in the late 1990's, I decided to stick with her, purely for the company, and besides I didn't like the idea of living on my own.. The abuse turned into several arguments, one resulting with me moving out for about half the year interstate, and then moving back when I didn't have a place to stay at anymore (as was living with a girl I had met several years earlier.

Fast forward to now .. I'm still living with her (you're thinking to yourselves okay how can he put up with so much .. right?) things have heated up quite a fair bit because I used to pay some of the bills around the house, but then stopped, because hey why should I reward someone for their toxic attitude?! Simple equation .. speak to me like I'm worth nothing to you, and you get nothing in return ..   Anyway so what's happened as of recent is I've stopped paying bills etc for her realizing her true motive .. she's out to abuse me and get stuff done by me, bills paid etc ... Here's something else, she is on blood pressure medication, and she does like a drink or two .. maybe more .. I have a feeling that the alcohol is mixing with the tablets/medication she's taking .. leading her into the rather violent abusive behaviour in which she has thrown stuff at me like one night, sitting at the table for dinner, she gets fairly wound up and throws a table knife at me .. missed though and hit the cabinet behind me.

I have called the cops on her because I have felt rather unsafe in the house, as per instruction by one of the online counselling websites .. she has said that if I call the cops again she will kill me .. I doubt she will do it .. but hey there's no telling with her .. I have, on my possession a recording device, I have on several occasions gathered evidence of her being abusive and threatening towards me .. even one with her stating to me that what should happen if the cops were called again.

My question is: Should I try and hang the fact that I have possible pieces of evidence of her abusive behaviour against her, take it to a solicitor and get legal advice? Or should I keep my mouth shut, try and find a way out, once out, seek legal advice and then look to raise a case against her ? I just feel like I'm trapped here that's all.",AuSSiETiG3R,2020-02-02 00:11:15,1,551,56.41,36.51,75.01,9.95,17.22,15.43,91.65,59.17,18.33,14.16,9.07,0,0.73,3.99,0.36,4.17,6.53,16.33,9.26,5.08,7.62,1.27,18.87,2.9,2,1.27,1.81,1.81,4.9,1.81,3.09,0.54,2,0.18,9.62,0.54,0,4.17,0.36,12.52,2.36,2.18,2,4.17,1.09,3.45,1.27,0.36,0.36,0.54,2.72,0.54,1.63,0,0.54,6.17,0.73,1.09,2.54,1.63,0.91,5.63,9.26,1.45,16.15,2.72,8.53,5.99,1.81,0.73,0.54,1.27,0,0.36,1.27,0,0.18,0.18,0,0.54,20.87,8.71,5.08,0.36,0,0.73,0.36,0.18,0,3.99,1.27,0.18
exnmh5,"How do I help my friend/convince her to leave? (long post, sorry :) )","Hi, I have a question about stalkers, need some opinions on a situation…

My best friend is being stalked by her ex.  They broke up over a year ago.   About 4 months ago she got a restraining order.

He’s been bypassing it in various ways, following her, manipulating her daughter through other people, etc… All in ways hard to prove to the police so it just keeps continuing…  He’s obsessed with her 6 year old daughter, its creepy.  (Got her pic as his facebook profile even) – It’s not his kid.  He’s a 51 year old biker drug addict obsessed with a 6 year old girl and her mom.  She’s 37.

She’s bipolar and has been very stable for a long time until this stuff started, this is causing some serious issues, breaking her down, rapid cycling, even suicidal thoughts… Isolated herself from everyone, shut down her facebook entirely, etc.  

What’s worse, is she is a gun owner, but because of how she’s felt mentally she gave her gun to her family, which means she doesn’t have proper protection.

I want to help her, but I’m on an island 2000 miles away (moved away 11 year ago).

In my opinion, she should move out here for a year or so.  I’m a longtime friend of her family, known her since she was a kid, she knows she’s safe here and stuff (I’m one of her closest friends).  I’m on a beautiful island, and every inch of my property is covered by security cameras.  It’s very safe/secure here.  

Her stress would go away, her bipolar would calm down, she could go back to being happy and mentally healthy.  She’d go home in a much better mental and financial state.   Even she knows that would be the result of coming…

Only thing keeping her from doing it, is she fears that it wouldn’t matter, that when she goes back, he’s just going to be there waiting, and then her restraining order stuff would have to start over again and she’d have to go through even more of the process.  

Asshole has her conditioned into thinking she needs to accept he’s always going to be part of her life, that she’ll never be able to make him go away. (I disagree)  …  She points at his ex, previous to her…  He still bugs her from time to time, finds ways to get involved with her life…  His previous ex has just given up and accepted he won’t go away… I don’t think that’s the right way to deal with this shit.

I think if she came here for a year or so, and went back at a random time down the road, and severed ties with anyone connecting him to her, got a job at a different place, new place to live… He probably wouldn’t know she was back, and enough time would pass that hopefully his attention will have shifted to something else so he wouldn’t even be looking at that point.

I’m worried if she doesn’t get some distance, get to a safe place that things are just going to go one of 2 ways, he’s either going to escalate till she/her daughter get hurt, or she’s going to give up and accept he’s never going to go away, which is going to fuck with her bipolar endlessly, shutting her down in many ways.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I convince her my idea is way better than staying and dealing with it hoping it gets better? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any other suggestions?  I hate being so far away, basically helpless outside of offering to get her out of the situation.

Appreciate any input!

exrlh4,An update; I left about eight months ago.,"I wrote in this sub a long time ago, asking for advice on how to leave and explaining what was happening. I ended up deleting the post out of fear that he would somehow see it and physically hurt me again for speaking about the things that happened. But one day, early in the morning he started to get angry with me. He found one of the baby's toys not in her bin, and I had left one of my boots on the floor when we had gotten home the previous night. He became angry, violent, and mentally abusive in a matter of seconds. Screaming at me, calling me every name there was. Throwing the baby's toys and my boot at me. And something just clicked on my mind, and said ""Hey, if you stay today you are going to be seriously hurt again."" So I grabbed the baby's bottles from the kitchen and I locked she and I in our bedroom and began to pack. I called my mother, and soon my parents showed up. I took some things and I left him that day. Eight months later, and now I'm in a very happy healthy relationship. Having a baby, and moving into an apartment with someone who I love and who loves me just as much. I'm extremely happy. I got a pfa against my ex for a while and dropped it recently to allow him to see our daughter. He is very good to her and we coparent well. 

That being said, if you are wondering how on earth you'll feel or be without someone who is abusing you, I promise you will feel liberated. You will find unbelievable happiness, and you will find yourself again. I have never felt more whole in my life, and I regret nothing other than not leaving sooner. If anyone else is wondering if they should leave somebody abusive; the answer is yes. If you even have to wonder if you should leave that should tell you enough. I survived years of domestic abuse. I lived, and now I feel more alive than ever. I promise you will be so much happier once you get out! Dms are open for anyone who needs advice. It gets better.",ashehole64,2020-02-02 09:18:14,3,384,24.82,70.79,87.37,21.76,14.22,13.8,94.27,59.9,22.4,16.41,8.85,1.04,3.65,2.6,0.26,5.99,4.69,11.72,7.55,6.51,9.11,1.3,19.79,4.69,2.6,2.08,1.56,1.82,6.51,3.12,3.39,0.26,1.82,0.78,15.1,1.04,0,1.3,1.82,13.8,3.39,0.78,3.12,4.69,1.82,4.17,3.91,0.78,1.3,1.82,1.82,0,1.04,0,0.26,5.21,2.08,0.52,0.78,2.08,0,6.77,9.38,2.08,17.19,1.82,6.77,8.59,0.26,0.52,1.3,0,0,0.26,1.04,0,0,0.26,0.26,0,13.8,6.77,4.17,0,0.52,0,0.26,0,0.52,1.56,0,0

exzq8b,Abuser hurts me when we sleep together. (TW),Since moving out I've still continued seeing him and since my last post I saw him again which I feel so stupid for. The last few days he has kept telling me that I'm welcome to move back in which I didn't. Well whenever I see him when we sleep together he purposely hurts me and does things that I've told him many times to not do. He didn't use to do this all the time. it's only since I've moved out. During arguments while living together he choked me so for that reason I'm scared of my head or neck being touched. While sleeping together lately he's started choking me.

ey3ttz,Stepdad (40) almost hit my sister (16) because of my mother.,"There have been serious issues in my family for a long time. It started when my mother married my stepdad 6 years ago. I am now 20 and my sister 16 and we have three toddler brothers who we take care of almost all of the time, whenever my mom and him go out or are fighting like two adolescents. In October of last month my sister and I found out my mother was cheating on my stepdad and that she was pregnant. We confronted her about it and she turned her back on us and made us feel like it was all out fault, she played the victim, made everyone turn their back on us and threatened to kill herself. We had to stay at my aunts house for almost a month to which she was not happy about because she doesn’t want anyone to find out what is going on in our house. She manipulates us, emotionally abuses us, neglects is and has several times kicked us out of the house. Today she left the house with her two sons and left us the middle child to take care of. We didn’t have anything to eat in the house while she was away. We told her we were hungry and she got mad. She got home at about 9 and said she brought us food and that if we didn’t want it she would throw it away. She started yelling at us and kicked the door open from our room. My sister obviously got heated so she yelled at her back this is when my stepdad burst into the room, kicked the door open once again and almost hit my sister it it wasn’t for her hands that shielded her. He yelled at her and my mother did nothing, she said really harmful things and how she would never talk to me again. I don’t know what to do, we can’t live in this house anymore.

I hope the mods will leave this up, because I think this is so, so important to hear. Please watch the video linked below
  
If you've been following the news, Amber Heard has accused Johnny Depp of being abusive during their marriage. However, a long tape has surfaced where she admits abusing HIM. Reason: he walks away when she gets violent. That makes her insecure. He made a vow to be there in the good times and the bad, so how dare he go to another room when she starts throwing pots, pans and vases. And then not come back to apologize. In her words: ""I can't promise I won't get physical. I'm human, I get angry, and you drive me to that point.""

eyd6ja,My (22F) dad hit my mom again and I don’t know what to do,"On NYE, my mom called my brother (28M) and I in for a family meeting, and told us that my dad and her had gotten into a fight while driving. She had been nagging him about picking at his teeth, and he got so mad that he hit her and said (in our native language) “you never learn, how many times will I have to hit you for you to know your place” etc. My mom turned the car around and came back to tell us, while he was there.

My brother was shocked and confused. But I wasn't surprised because when I was 16 something similar happened. That time they kept arguing, with my dad getting more aggressive, and I was so scared I called a domestic abuse hotline. And in our daily lives, he makes these cutting, belittling remarks at her that are cruel. 

That night, we talked to them and separated them. As planned, my mom flew out of the country a few days later to visit family. But now she's coming back early (tomorrow, in fact) and I'm really panicked and I don't know what to do. 

My family never talked any of this afterwards, except this text my mom sent to me and my brother (below). It breaks my heart that she thinks this relationship is a normal marriage. She doesn't deserve to be treated this way. As I've grown up, I've tried to help with her burdens around the house, make her feel more appreciative and listened to (main complaints). But I feel like I should have done more and something sooner. Now, she doesn't seem to feel like she's in any physical danger. But I'm still afraid something will happen. 

My brother and I are both financially independent and could try to support her if needed. But my mom made it clear to me NYE that she doesn't want to talk about her feelings or be pitied. The only thing she told me is that I should talk to my dad if I wanted too. 

I can barely think about this issue without feeling like I'm 16 and breaking down. And honestly, part of me feels resentful that I've been asked/felt compelled to feel like a mediator at such a young age. My home life also was shitty for other reasons. 

I'd appreciate any resources, guides, or personal anecdotes about how to proceed now. (Though yes, I am trying to go see a therapist, and yes, I have ""Why Does He Do That"" which I highly recommend). 

(Idk how to attach an image, so this is what her text said:

 Just boarded.  
Very sorry for what happened on New Year’s Eve.  
I lost control. I just  wanted to make a point that I did not accept to be treated with mean language and wanted to be respected.  I got you two involved just to make this  point straight. I guess it is normal to have arguments between husband and wife in a marriage of over 30 years. I just felt sorry to get you two involved.  
Everything is fine.  We loved his family so much. You two are the best. Don’t worry about us.  
Take care! )

TDLR: My dad has been abusive to my mom over the years, and he recently hit her again. I feel like something should change but don't know what to do.

I   am hoping someone can help by referring resources. I'll try to make my   very long story short. I was in a very violent relationship (suffered   concussions and injuries to legs and arms) and forced to quit my job  and  move out of my apartment bc I feared my ex doing more harm to   me-threats were made that I would be killed. I have been hit in the head   with a gun by my ex, so I did not take those threats lightly. My ex  has  since been arrested and sentenced to years in prison. Here's the   problem, when you are a domestic violence survivor, battered women   shelters offer you a place to live, but once the abuser has been   convicted and detained, you're out of luck and the shelters will not   help you because ""you're no longer in danger"".

I   am now homeless and unemployed in Los Angeles, and although I have   contacted 211 for help, the organizations are overwhelmed and cannot   help. I am college educated and just need an opportunity to get back on   my feet. I have a car, but if I do not find a job soon, it may be   repossessed. I never thought I would experience something this painful   and traumatic.  I am a very private person, so posting this is   humiliating, but I am out of options. I grew up in foster care, so do   not have support from family or friends. This is depressing and I am   ready to give up.

I am posting this on different groups bc I am not sure where to go for help.

If anyone knows of any solutions, please help.

eymb97,Help me (15F) please. My parents are finally piecing everything together and they found out I told others about the abuse. I’m so terrified right now I can’t even think.,"Sorry if I sound discombobulated. I need urgent help. I’m fucking terrified right now.

A couple months ago, I came here asking for advice, as my (46M) dad hit my (39F) mom in the head. The police got called and it was really ugly. I was going to go to the authorities about it until I eventually gave into their control and fear-mongering. 

However... lately, with some more events that have happened in my household, I have been strongly considering telling authorities and leaving. But I’m fucking terrified. What just happened earlier today made me even more terrified. I’m fucking frozen.

I told my friend’s family, aka my neighbors, about the abuse last summer. I didn’t want them to confront my parents about it for my safety, but I just wanted them to support me. They have. When my mom kicked me out on Halloween, they let me stay there. They’ve given me clothes and food when I’ve needed it. I’m thankful for that.

Naturally, though, they started to disconnect themselves from my parents. Her parents deleted them on Facebook, and my friend herself deleted and blocked my mom. She found out about this and she knows it’s due to me. She is demanding information about what we’ve talked about, access to my phone, and that I cease all contact with them. I am not allowed to hang out with my friend anymore.

My own little brother ratted me out to my mom and told me that I talk about my parents’s abuse to my trusted friends. I guess he’s looked over my shoulder.

I got out of it for now, I made up a bunch of excuses and I’m planning to stage a “confrontation” with my friend so I can make it look like I’m “loyal” to them. I’ve been excused of being a “traitor” and my mom told me I’m abusing everyone and that  I have no loyalty. I want to run away.

I also want to call DHS... but if they come to investigate, my parents will know it is because of me, and I will likely have to experience more violence and abuse as a result.

eyoi9w,My ex killed me. How do I come back?,"I was in a really abusive relationship for 8 years. 
It’s caused what the doctors believe a life time of pain and exhaustion. I’ll never, ever heal from it. 

I was always so loving, open to hugs and kisses and being close with someone. 

Now? I don’t feel love. Like ever. 

I’ve ignored/ghosted my friends for months because the thought of having ANY relationship is exhausting. It’s not that I don’t care, but I don’t miss them either. I don’t think I’d be bothered if they never spoke to me again. 

I have no desire to create any human connections. I have a child who is 7 and he is the *only* human I can be “normal” with. He’s the only person I can cuddle and get close to without feeling disgusted and icky. My relationship with my son is amazing. He’s the only person I am healthy for. Which I know is not healthy. 

He’s never seen me have friends or other adults in my life apart from family members. I know that’s not good for him, either. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’ve lost every single piece of myself. I’m horrible, withdrawn, I hate relationships of *any* kind... It’s almost as if I’ve lost the ability to give a fuck about anyone but myself (and my son, of course). 

I don’t engage in any of my hobbies anymore, and every time I have tried I have hit a brick wall. I can’t think. I can’t create. I can’t move forward. 

Since the last assault, my memory has been awful. I honestly can’t remember what I did yesterday, let alone a week ago. And I mean AT ALL. Not a single part of yesterday is in my memory. I’m forgetting all the important milestones with my child. I won’t be able to tell him anything about his childhood because I will forget. 

I’m alive and breathing. But I am completely dead. I wish I was actually dead. It would be easier than feeling like this. 

I’ve done therapy. I’ve tried every single antidepressant the doctor can offer. (turns out I’m too medication sensitive. Yup, can’t even take antibiotics when I’m unwell without severe side effects.) 

I don’t know what else to do. 

He killed me and in turn, I’m destroying *everything* around me.",helpmebebetterpls,2020-02-04 03:08:41,11,396,6.72,3.68,98.01,18.34,9,13.89,98.23,61.11,22.98,17.93,15.4,0,0,2.02,0.51,5.05,4.04,10.61,15.91,6.06,5.81,5.81,25.25,4.55,1.77,2.02,1.26,4.04,9.6,4.55,5.05,0.25,2.02,1.01,9.85,0.76,0.51,0,2.53,18.18,4.04,2.02,1.26,2.78,3.28,6.31,1.52,0.25,0.25,1.01,3.79,0.25,3.03,0.25,0,8.08,3.28,2.02,1.77,1.01,0,4.29,19.95,1.01,10.86,1.26,4.55,5.81,0.76,0.51,0.25,0,0,1.52,0.76,0.25,0.25,0.25,0,0,26.26,11.11,3.03,0,0,0.51,0,0,0.51,8.33,1.01,1.77
eyoxuf,At a loss for what to do,"So my best friend has been in an on and off again relationship for about 10 years now. They have a child now and just a couple of months ago broke up again (he has a history of cheating, gaslighting, financial and emotional abuse.) Her daughter (my goddaughter’s) birthday party was held recently and the child’s father brought along his new girlfriend without consulting with her first. My best friend commenced to go hysterical and nearly attacked the both of them. Her family managed to get the father + his new girlfriend to leave before things got physical/even more out of hand. Fast forward a week or so later, she tells me he has since contacted her to ‘apologize’ but from what she’s telling me, it sounds more like further gaslighting (trying to make this all her fault, telling her how better his new girlfriend is compared to her) and on top of all that, told her he actually had brought along a gun to the party ‘just in case someone got in his face.’ When I tell you I had no idea how to respond.. I just don’t even know how to even address this. I told her to file for full custody.. to put a restraining order on him but it all just seems to fall on deaf ears. I don’t want her to isolate herself but this is now turning into a dangerous situation. Her entire family, all of our friends WERE AT THAT PARTY. Someone could’ve gotten hurt. Am I overreacting? I tried to get her to understand but she’s just telling me she doesn’t think he’d actually hurt anyone. She’s even refusing to let the rest of our friends + her family know. 
My question is, how do I proceed if she doesn’t cut him out of her life? She’s once again promised me she’s cutting him out and that she’ll file for custody and etc but this isn’t the first time she’s promised something like that..

She's looking at atleast 3 months of recovery time, thats how bad this was. She's been lying to everyone and saying that she slipped in the shower. When I went to go see her I was shocked when I saw that HE was by her side. She is saying that it is 'her fault' because she attacked him first and that she doesnt want to do anything about it because she wants their 3 children to have a dad in their life. 

May I add that their 3 children are little girls and 2 of them witnessed the beating. I have a bad feeling about all of this, and I don't know how to convince her to do something about it.

Malachi’s dad burned his little baby hands with boiling water when he was just a toddler. He still had the scars and therapies to work through to this day.

Malachi and his mama, Kesha, both deserve to feel safe. And unfortunately, the system let them down. Just yesterday they found out that his father may be released on a technicality. That’s where you come in.

Please sign the [petition](https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/do-not-free-dante-roberson?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;loc=thank-you-page&amp;fbclid=IwAR29qTrUQtBQmfeAice6SfG_NNoc9Vb6srTW7LJH92fvm7_vty8HehogS4s), and or write a letter to send to kesha\_team@yahoo.com to advocate for their safety in keeping his father in jail to serve his full sentence.

I know many of us are not supporters of imprisonment as a system, but at this point in time, this is the only option many women and children have to feel safe from violent abusive men in a world where there isn’t much protection or support systems in place for mothers and children, who should be able to live in safety and without fear.

&amp; Write a supportive email to Kesha if you are able.

eyw7ju,Eating disorders and link to domestic violence/abuse,"A friend of mine is dating a man who was previously married to a woman with an eating disorder. The disorder was so significant that it required hospitalizations on and off for a number of years throughout their marriage.

This fact, along with a few other things make me worry that this man that my friend is dating may have been abusive toward his ex. I don't know this for a fact, but I understand there this is sometimes a link between eating disorders and domestic violence.

Since I have had my own experience with domestic violence, I don't want to bring my own crap into this situation...but I worry about it for her. I don't plan to do anything at this point with the information, but I wanted to gain some insight for my own knowledge.

Few other things about him make me a little nervous, like jealous behavior, ""opinions"" about how to do things the right way, and the fact that he painted himself the victim of a controlling wife also concern me.

This questionnaire looking for **men who have experienced female-perpetrated IPV**.

IPV can take a number of forms such as physical violence (e.g. hitting), undermining (e.g. being told you’re useless), sexual violence (e.g. sexual coercion), or other controlling behaviour (e.g. isolating from family). 

Unfortunately, not a lot is known about the experiences of men who have experienced IPV, which means there is not a lot of understanding and resources to help. 

If you man who has experienced IPV by a female partner, please complete this questionnaire:

eyy38s,Mom was beaten my dad,"I don’t know what to think at this point. My mom was abused by my dad this morning. I always thought of my dad and a smart and nice dude, but my parents have hated each other for really long. This morning i was asleep but awake, and I overheard my mom crying and my dad saying “shut the fuck up.” My mom used to have mental problems but they got better if that has to do with anything. I didn’t think much of it as it was really subtle and I thought that I just misheard. But today, she talked to me and told me not to tell anyone, and I agreed to. This is what happened according to my mom: My mom texted my dad something that probably got him mad, as they have been fighting for the last couple days (I’ll explain that later) and 20 minutes later, while my mom was making coffee, my dad comes down and just slaps my mom and she falls to the ground. He just repeatedly kicks her then leaves. My mom was bleeding just a bit, but nothing major happened to her. What made me the most upset was that I really looked up to my dad and this is what I hear from my mom, and I know that she wouldn’t lie to me like that. Before this all happened, about 2 nights later, they got in a huge fight and my dad was acting chill because maybe he wanted us to think that he was the victim. But I guess he just let it all out.

ez23ii,Domestic violence at my neighbours house,"I was outside, having a smoke when my neighbours car pulled up. They both get out and instantly I hear screaming. Both of them, each time louder than the next. I go inside. I stop for a second and put my shoes on. I go back outside and watch. Phone at the ready. I see him shove her into a wall, her slap at him, him put his hands near her neck. I don't see exactly what he does. She knees him in the groin. She manages to break away, and thankfully walk my way. I'm standing trying to make myself look big so hopefully she sees me (in my head this is so incase I back down and become a coward). She shouts at him, ""look, a nice neighbour is watching leave me alone!"". He walks back to the house. I call to her, ""would you like to come inside?"" She sits on my bench outside. We talk for some time, 10 minutes? I get her permission to call the police and reassure her that everything is going to be ok. She comes inside.

We sit down on the couch. I've got my mom and sister with me and we just talk while we wait for the police. He calls her phone ~5 times. She answers twice and more yelling. She describes where she is and who I am, which is unfortunate I suppose but whatever.

The police come and we talk outside. They take my statement. I describe what I've said above. Eventually they leave. Patricia gives me a hug before she goes, thanking me for my help. I again reassure her that everything is going to be OK. The police take her to a hotel with her dog and her essentials.

Patricia is older, 72, and she's lived across the street from me for 2 years. I've seen domestic violence there before, and called the police. I don't know the rules on this subreddit, but if you're reading this and you're in crisis there are people who will help you. I just needed to type this out.

ez612y,He told me I wasn’t a victim,"I wanted to get this off my chest. I recently left a relationship of a year and a half. His moments of anger started off innocent enough and just seemed the stress of his career was taking a toll on him.  They were unpredictable and I could never see them coming. 

He is proficient in combat sports and I also had experience as well, so on occasion we’d ‘play fight’ . This started off as being a joking/playful thing and occasionally he’d make comments that he would use this to “teach me a lesson”. Sometimes this would lead to sex so it came across as more of a fetish. 

When arguments would occur it would result in him grabbing my wrist so hard that they would bruise and hurt for days. This started happening every time we’d argue. I’d complain or try to break away and he wouldn’t let go and squeeze tighterZ His eyes would look black. When he wasn’t angry he was always remorseful and said he promised not to do it again.  He also became more violent when it came to sexual experiences and would often do things without my consent or pressuring me into something.  He said he had a rape fantasy and I was being a good girlfriend by appeasing him. When I suggested using a safe word he refused without any explanation. When I questioned him he got angry and said it was because he said so.

I am a educated independent women and never thought I’d end up in a situation like this.   I decided to confront him on his behavior, thinking it was just a misunderstanding or him not really understanding how his behavior was effecting me. I calmly tried to sit down and talk to him about how I didn’t like him forcefully pushing me around, grabbing, slapping etc. He raged. I’ve never been so fearful in my life. I couldn’t see anything but black in his eyes. He was inches from my face and I could see his fist balled up and shaking. He kept shouting at me that I am not a victim. That was shocking for me. I never once described myself to him or to anyone else as a victim- I was his girlfriend. I realize you can be both.  This became a common occurrence throughout our relationship.  I thought that every couple has struggles and that you just had to work through them. He would always be very kind and sweet after and I was naive enough to give him the opportunity to do it again. 

I gained enough courage to end the relationship. Now that I’m removed from it, I can truly see how abusive he was to me. One of the many things he said that still haunts me is he told me if we were to ever break up and he saw me with another man, he didn’t think he could handle himself. When I asked him what he meant he said he would lose control and be filled with jealousy and rage. I asked if that would still apply if we amicably split up, or if he broke up with me/cheated. He said it didn’t matter. I would always be his. 

It’s been a 5 months. I sleep lighter now.  I’ve started dating again, but I’m always looking over my shoulder. I’m worried he might see me out with someone else or catch me in a moment where I’m not paying attention. I’m worried about what he would do.  

I realized through this experience how easy it is to fall into this cycle and stay there. I know there are others who have been through much worse for much longer and my heart goes out to you.",isthisreallife91,2020-02-04 23:49:30,4,633,7.54,49.37,43.79,3.36,14.39,14.85,95.89,64.14,25.91,19.43,9.32,0.79,0.47,8.21,0.63,6.48,3.63,11.85,12.01,6.79,9.16,2.69,21.8,3.48,1.9,2.21,0.63,1.74,7.58,2.53,4.9,1.11,2.21,0.63,15.01,0,0.32,0.16,8.37,15.96,3,2.21,3.48,3.48,2.05,4.42,4.58,1.9,1.26,0.79,2.21,1.26,0.16,0.63,0.16,6.48,1.74,1.42,2.53,0.95,0.47,8.69,7.9,0.32,15.01,2.05,5.69,6.95,0.95,0.79,0,0.16,0,0,0.16,0,0,0,0.16,0,12.48,6.79,1.26,0,0,0,0,0.16,0.47,3.48,0,0.32

ez91mn,I am being falsely accused of committing domestic violence on my partner and I need help.,"Oh boy... a lot of back story to this since my case is now being set to trial, so sit tight with me through this please.

-
So basically here is a past look at my relationship: https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/e10wn2/update_i_cant_post_this_in_rrelationships_i_am_in/ and **AS A DISCLAIMER YES I KNOW THE LINK INSIDE THE LINK STATES I HAD A SON, I WAS ATTEMPTING TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS FROM MY EX AT THE TIME**

-
Now that is out of the way, the following dates are going to be very important. I left Washington State on November 18th 2019, I moved back to Nevada, after searching for a place to live on my own and remain in my daughters life, but unfortunately could not locate such a place before that time. Ex wanted me to stay in the state and live at a friend of hers house, and obviously based on the title you'll understand why that was a bad idea and I'm so glad I didn't do it. 

-
Soon as I got back to Vegas my ex basically blocked me on everything, Facebook, Text, Phone call, Instagram, Discord, Skype, anything and everything. Ex then 3 days after I left on the 21st of November physically went to a police station and claimed that I had assaulted her allegedly sometime between the 1st of November to the 12th of November, giving no exact time or date. No witnesses, And she stated I allegedly had choked her when we were sitting on the couch not arguing, watching our daughter play. She stated I choked her hard enough to make it hurt to swallow for a few hours, and  that the BACK of her neck hurt, however she stated she never once lost the ability to breath, never lost consciousness, and that she stood up and walked away immediately after this happened claiming I said ""It was just a joke""

-
The entire incident she describes and the way she describes it sounds like it literally took place in the matter of seconds. Personally idk if you've ever choked someone but SINCE I got accused of this horrible thing, I tried to choke myself, just to see how hard you actually have to choke someone to hurt their neck and throat, and let me tell you you have to choke someone pretty god damn hard, I couldn't even do it hard enough to make my own throat hurt, but that is all besides the point.

-
Anyways she filed these charges against me without letting me know, completely behind my back while I was begging her via email to please let me video chat with my daughter which she claimed her ""therapist"" told her that she doesn't need to let me speak to my child and that it isn't important. She also stated to my mother that she would go back to letting my daughter talk to me ""Once the dust settled and custody was over later that month"" Thats right. She thought custody cases take a month to get settled. 

-
Anyways, I continued to beg her every day to please let me be involved in our daughters life, which she ignored, became hostile, or flat out told me no. All while she filed these charges against me. Then on December 1st of 2019 she told me in an email I owe her $2500, which I told her no. I'm not paying her for that and she was basically trying to ransom my kid back to me (in way of ""make me happy and you can talk to your kid or don't ever talk to her again"") 

-
Then on December 23rd 2019 I got my subpoena. 4th Degree Domestic Assault. This was a shock to me because I had NEVER laid my hands on my ex. The person accusing me of this is the same person who constantly threatened suicide in our relationship when she didn't get her way. I looked up the police report, paid like $20 to have it printed, and it said all the information I listed above. She also claimed I'd been hospitalized for PTSD (not true) and that she was ""fearful"" that I was going t to come back to Washington and attack her and ""finish the job"" 

-
The officer who took the report wrote down COMPLETELY different information than what my ex had in her statement, almost to the point where it contradicted it. Did no investigation, and sent it off to a prosecutors office for the city without a second thought, all because it was filed shortly before the Thanksgiving/Christmas holiday. Prosecutor picked it up, didn't even look at it and signed off on it taking the case. 

-
So I filed a motion of continuance, because my arraignment hearing was the 30th of December, and getting a round trip ticket from NV to WA after Christmas but before New Years was expensive as all hell, Judge never got to it, Couldn't find a Public Defender, and couldn't talk to anyone in the court system because of the holiday period, I had to borrow money to make my flight to WA. While in WA I pleaded not guilty, but BEFORE getting to WA I went through every single text, email,  facebook message, facebook post, Photograph, Video, Texts my ex had sent to mutual friends, to my parents, any and all little bit of information from November 1st to the exact day I flew on my plane to go to WA for court. All of this was printed, time stamped, organized, labeled, and laminated. I also brought with me a USB file with the same information electronically, and had uploaded all this information on a google drive account, and put it on a friends work computer as well as my roommates.

-
This turned into a 700+ page binder for my public defender (PD) who was appointed to me. She stated she would go through it and be in touch. I was allowed to return to Nevada with a no contact order for my ex, not being allowed to possess a firearm in any state (why? I still wasn't accused of being guilty, and I lived several states away and was working as a Security Officer unarmed in an armed position in what has been the most dangerous job I've ever had to date) and to come back for pre trial on the 3rd of February 2020.

-
On January 2nd 2020 I was once again served by my ex, custody paperwork, stating she wanted full custody, a restraining order stating I was never allowed to see/speak to my child or her, that I was abusive to my child, abandoned my child, had no emotional ties with my child, stating she expected me to pay 100% of all her legal fees throughout this entire process, and that she wanted to do all of this without mediation, just wanting it to go straight to a judge to sign off on it. I had to borrow $3000 to pay for an attorney for child custody, who has been insanely helpful throughout this process. 

-
Before returning for pre trial my PD got the ""full"" police report, which had no new evidence or changes to the police report I already had this entire time. Nothing. No photos or anything. In fact it came with the 911 audio of my ex calling the police station sitting in her parents car (while alone) stating she was ""doing this to protect MY (as in her) baby"" which I'd like to point out my entire life I've never been charged for a crime, assaulted anyone in any way or sense, and never laid my hands on a woman in any unwanted/non consenting or violent form. My entire career field has been spent in the military, or as some form of Security/Law Enforcement. Anyways, I returned to WA on February 3rd for my pre trial, which once AGAIN before trial even started I was served by my ex, from a delivery person (I dunno what you call them) with the exact same paperwork she had already served me on the 2nd of January. Was this to make me look bad in front of the judge? Intimidate me? Make me lash out at her? A warning? I'm not sure. However my child custody lawyer had already filed her motion of appearance, and even emailed my ex, which she now had to email AGAIN stating not to contact me and that she was not allowed to have me served, that any future servings had to be done through her law office. Which my ex never responded to, or the first time when the motion of appearance was served. 

-
I sat there all day at pre trail waiting for my name to be called, which I was the VERY last person literally only me in the court room audience area. The prosecutor openly and verbally (in front of my PD, and the judge) that she had never once reviewed my case, that she didn't know who I was, and that she had misplaced my case file, which my PA had to physically assist her with finding (which was on the opposite side of the court room somehow) which my PA had repeatedly asked throughout the day what the prosecutors plea bargain was going to entail, since at this point they had offered none. The  PD and Prosecutor both spoke privately, and then myself and my PD spoke privately which she explained the Prosecutor verbally offered me to sign a form with the city in court stating that I would agree to not commit any acts of domestic violence for 1 year, the case would be put on pause, and that charges would be dropped. This meant I was unable to see or speak to my daughter for over a year, and that the DV charges would bleed into my custody case for my daughter with my ex. The other option being go to trial. 

-
I chose to go to trial. I know I'm innocent, a victim of false allegations, and that my ex is doing this to hurt me, out of anger of our relationship ending, and to gain control of my daughter. Now we get to the reason I post. I've never had to testify for ANYTHING before in my life, I've never been through the court process and all of this has been a massive drain on me emotionally, physically, mentally, and financially. My custody lawyer states that I made the right choice, but how do I testify for something my ex can't even give an exact date to? Something that was not only fake, but wasn't even born out of something that could even be SLIGHTLY misconstrued as anything close to this happening. What kind of stuff is the prosecutor going to ask me? I know to remain calm, I know to give short direct answers, but still... I'm just so lost in this. 

I know I can ask my PD this stuff, but I wanted someones opinion here because I do not get to talk to my PD until much later this month. I tried posting this in /r/legaladvice and it was deleted, and frankly most of the time when I post there things are deleted and the mods kind of seem like dicks. I'm not a criminal, I'm not an abuser, I'm just a guy who has the chance to lose his daughter and I'd rather that not happen. 

TL;DR: Never been through court. Ex charging me with 4th Degree DV. It is sent to trial, how does testifying work and what will the prosecutor ask me?",BAL2282,2020-02-05 04:46:45,8,1968,54.1,36.87,72.81,10.4,28.94,16.41,87.45,57.67,19.05,12.65,8.84,0.3,0.41,2.95,0.15,6.4,5.59,15.35,7.77,4.83,5.95,2.85,14.84,3.05,1.68,1.78,1.07,1.83,3.25,1.02,2.24,0.25,0.76,0.56,10.72,0.81,0.56,3.46,0.3,11.28,1.58,1.47,1.17,2.39,2.54,2.95,2.08,0.81,0.56,0.71,1.52,0.46,1.02,0.05,0.1,5.95,1.22,0.71,2.85,0.81,0.61,6.96,6.2,0.71,15.4,1.83,6.96,6.81,1.68,0.66,0.41,0.81,0.2,0.05,1.73,0.15,0.3,0.1,0.1,0.3,14.99,3.35,5.54,0.1,0.05,0.41,0,0.71,0.81,1.52,0.91,1.58

Tl;dr went public with a relationship with a girl who has an ex abuser, and she pretty immediately moved back in with him and now it’s real weird, and I think it was a big mistake.

I currently have plane tickets to go see her, and she wants me to. Gonna offer to move her out again, and make sure baby daddy isn’t gonna do anything that’ll get someone killed. But I also can’t do this much longer. Can’t eat, can’t sleep, I’ve shut off from stress. I can’t keep playing emotional support boyfriend. I can be friends, I can always offer to help her out, and if she’s ready, I’ll help her leave. But I don’t think she’ll let me if I wasn’t. So idk. So tired. I don’t want to be the crutch in their relationship. It’s gross. He’s gross. And I’m coping with what she’s doing because I understand it but it’s really hard to watch someone make plans with you while they sabotage themselves, and run into a situation that become imminently more dangerous. Theyre kinda like children on a playground. And I’m losing it. I really really care about her, and I don’t want to abandon her.

I am scared and I feel bad to leave him because we have been together for 8 years and we just moved in together on Saturday. Am I right for wanting to file a police report? I know that right now I’m feeling a whole lot of emotions at this point. He made me feel bad last night by telling me that I would end his life (we are both in our mid 20’s) by calling the cops on him.

ezde2l,Dating a survivor and just need some guidance,"I’m currently a month into “officially” dating a survivor. She was with an abuser for a little under 2 years, and at first, it was mostly mental and emotional, finally ending in one ugly physical episode and she hasn’t seen him since. This happened a little over a year ago. 

We met 7 months ago, and roughly 8 months since the episode. We were casual for a long time because she clearly felt she wasn’t ready (and I understood),  up until a month ago when we decided to be together. 

For the most part it’s been great, but she warned me of potential issues that could arise which I am now seeing. I do feel like I put more into it than she does in the sense that she has a hard time opening up. It’s frustrating for me but I totally understand it. I’ve assured her I’ll be patient. But then I hear things like “I’m not sure I can ever love again” and it makes me uneasy. Not because she shouldn’t feel that way, but do I take her at her word? She also mentions that she still thinks about him, often times with mixed emotions. That’s another one that makes me feel uneasy. 

I totally understand that it’s only been a little over a year for her and this process of healing takes time (and however long depends on the individual). I am more than willing to put in that time because I really feel she is worth it. I guess I am just looking for some advice, guidance, and perspective as to how to navigate this for myself as well as be as much of a help for her as I can.",anonymousbf123456,2020-02-05 09:53:06,3,294,25.26,41.92,86.26,25.77,17.29,14.29,95.24,63.61,22.45,14.97,7.82,1.02,0,6.12,0,7.48,5.78,14.63,10.2,6.8,9.52,1.7,18.37,6.12,4.08,1.02,2.04,2.72,5.78,2.38,2.38,0.68,1.02,0,10.54,0,0,5.44,0.68,16.67,4.08,3.06,1.02,2.72,2.04,4.08,3.74,1.02,0.34,2.04,1.02,0,0.68,0,0,8.16,3.06,1.36,2.38,1.36,0.34,5.1,12.93,1.02,18.71,0.68,7.48,10.54,0,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,0.34,0,15.31,5.1,3.4,0,0,0.34,0,0,1.36,3.74,1.36,0

eze5d9,"Are there instances of people not being believed, and therefore not accepted to domestic violence shelters?","I am coming down to my last dollar, my lease is ending, I have 3 months to find a job, and am not sure I can find new housing, because I have no credit score, few professional references or much working experience or background to prove I am credible. I need to escape my home and live the rest of my life, and hopefully with protection against my family.

I'm 23, finally able to escape my home situation and be independent, and my parents are not accepting that. They followed me into a store, attempted to tackle me down, and then would not leave and called the police and ambulance on me, the last time I did not want to go back to their house. The last time I lived at their house, my father barged into my room in the middle of the night, attempted to shake me, and then threatened to call the police on me when I told him to get out of my room.  They message me incessantly, insinuating I'm crazy, sick, and need to be at home and see a psychiatrist under their constant supervision. I am not, by the way. 

I have no place to go if I can't find housing and a job in 3 months. Not only that, but even in the off chance that I did, I don't feel safe. I need to get away from them and set boundaries for good.

I'm wondering if this is the kind of background and transition that domestic violence shelters help with? Is there is a chance you won't be believed? Has anybody not been?

My family was on all accounts ""good"" on the surface. People fail to see that I am struggling with domestic violence when my parents make a decent income, have paid for all my things and college tuition, and act so nice on the surface. My father barged into my room and tried to call the police on me, and I tried to call some hotlines for help, tried to get access to counseling, but all people could say was that it looks like my parents just really care about me, and didn't take it too seriously. Some people have believed me, and I appreciate that, but I grow concerned at times.

I'm wondering to what extent domestic violence shelters help, and if people are ever not believed?",Cococat512,2020-02-05 10:41:52,5,413,41.47,9.98,96.58,29.83,21.74,15.98,93.7,58.11,16.71,13.56,11.62,0,0.24,0.24,1.45,3.15,4.6,13.8,8.96,4.12,8.72,3.87,18.4,1.69,0.48,0.73,0.73,1.69,5.81,2.91,2.66,0.73,0.24,0.24,7.75,1.69,0,0,0.73,14.29,3.63,0.97,2.42,3.39,1.45,5.33,1.45,0.73,0.24,0.24,0.97,0,0.97,0,0,8.72,2.18,1.45,3.15,1.94,1.45,4.6,12.35,1.21,14.04,2.18,7.26,4.84,3.15,0.48,4.12,1.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.29,3.39,7.26,0,0,1.21,0,0,0.48,1.94,0,0

She also said that it's just her that sets him off.

This has gone on long enough, but unless she reports it is doesn't seem like there is anything that can be done. Or is there? What can I do?

I hope this is not seen as self promotion.  It is not.  I wrote this essay for a class in Jr. college actually a long time ago now.  I wrote it for the educational benefit, and as a kind of therapy -- as I Had just left an abusive marriage and in some ways, I was looking back and learning, looking at the present and wondering, and looking to the future with hope that it would not be a rerun.

I shared it originally, and still am, as simply an experience and details to share with those interested--another woman going through the same situations, an explanation to her children about what a mom might go through before she leaves that horrible situation, to the perpetrator, maybe if they see it from another point of view they will stop??? (that was probably a dream).

I come from a really unhealthy and dysfunctional family.  I continued the mess when I married the first time and made my own.  To this day, I'm trying to clean up the mess.  In fact, I'll probably be doing that the rest of my life.  But, I am trying.  The good news is that things get better.  There is light at the end of the tunnel.

I still share for all the same reasons.  I hope it helps someone.  Its not a really good academic work, but it's something simple that can be understood that might open the door for someone.

Today, I am a student at OSU (Oregon State), 57 yrs. old, on my 2nd marriage.  My kids are grown and out of the house.  In most ways, things just keep getting better.  At least in terms of not being with an abuser, and my own recovery.  Between my childhood and adulthood I have today, complex PTSD, anxiety stuff, depression, etc.  But, the fight continues and I encourage anyone and everyone in these horrible situations to come out swinging (in a metaphorical way) and care for yourself first.  If you don't care for you, how in the world will you ever be able to care for those kids?

It is not about him (or her, if she's the abusive one).  It's about you.  Getting you out, safe, and free from being terrorized.  It's about you being healthy.  It's about you taking your power back and giving voice to your experiences.

It's not over till it's over!  Get out.  Move up, and move on.  Enjoy your life.  Quit living in fear.",pegrowe62,2020-02-05 18:52:19,0,431,49.53,51.86,65.76,69.5,11.97,15.31,91.42,60.32,19.26,10.21,5.8,0,2.78,1.16,0.46,9.05,7.42,15.08,9.28,5.8,7.42,1.86,18.1,4.87,2.55,0.7,1.39,1.39,7.89,5.1,2.78,1.16,0.93,0.23,9.28,1.16,0,1.39,0.23,10.9,1.39,0.7,1.62,5.1,0.93,3.94,2.32,1.62,0.23,0,1.16,0,1.16,0,0,8.82,2.09,2.55,1.86,2.55,0.46,2.78,11.6,2.32,15.08,2.09,7.42,6.03,2.32,0.46,0.7,0.23,0,0,0.46,0,0.46,0,0,0,24.13,7.89,6.5,0,0,1.39,0.23,0.93,0,2.32,2.32,2.55
eznf9x,His fish committed suicide after only one day,"So I have survived two violent relationships and am starting to date again after a good couple years of abstinence. I know all the warning signs and my self esteem is better.  I am worried I might be on the verge of another abusive relationship. 
Went on dates with a truly professional musician who used to be in the military. He is very intense. Doesn’t after let me
Talk as
Much as he does and if we digress then he raises his voice a tiny bit but I can sense
Hidden anger. Not sure if because of military or if just him. He said he loved me on third date. He gave me a key to his place after 1 wk. he doesn’t make me laugh because I honestly don’t think he knows how to himself. I literally asked him to learn a joke. He calls me twice a day (a bit much for me but not a stalker vibe). He only ever wants to talk about “us” our future, me moving in,
If I don’t see him for a few days he is convinced we are breaking up. I tried to tell him it’s because I was on my period. Not a lie. We literally never have light hearted conversations but I like his soul. He volunteers. He reads a lot and follows the news. He writes songs and music. He isn’t self centered. We went to fish store and he bought his daughter a decent aquarium and a beta fish. He set it up correctly but the fish killed him self..... he jumped out of tank but with bad luck he was able to slide the lid enough to get completely out and died on the floor. I can’t help but wonder, is this a sign?? I am not a person to believe in these things but he is so crazy intense and I know that many men that have violent tendencies are too. I often avoid his texts and calls because they are just too much too fast. A 5 minute voicemail all about how much he loves me and how he is nothing like those “other guys”.   If I don’t return his call immediately he is convinced I am breaking up with him. Sometimes I make any excuse to get out of the apartment just for a breather from talking about so many heavy topics. My experience is when someone has to tell you what they aren’t generally they are that way.

ezpzl6,Tough appointment with a woman who is currently living what I lived.,"I work as a behaviour support clinician, and I met with the Mum of two of my clients today after she dropped off the radar for a couple of months. 

She is late 30's, with an 11 year old who is currently exploding with anger (not my client), and two younger children both with level 3 ASD. 

It was three hours of counselling her and teaching her about the cycle of abuse. What she told me was exactly what I lived for 9 years (and still being manipulated 18 months after I called the police and broke up with him (4 years in the making). It was uncanny. The events that led to our DVOs were almost identical. 

We had only intended to meet for an hour, but one thing led to another and I feel so privileged that I could give her validation and support. I've offered for her to have mail sent to the office as she makes preparations, and she's coming in each week (sometimes twice a week) with one or both children. I told her that this is a safe place for her. If she needs to make phone calls, she can freely without having to account to her partner and face his interrogation. 

I had to leave for my second job shortly afterwards, and my ex started messaging me asking if I would be home this afternoon, demanding to know what time I would be leaving work. Saying ""You can see how that makes it difficult for me to know what to do"" because he wanted to come over after work. 

I reflected on what I'd spoken about and taught this woman today, and I felt angry that he was trying to guilt me into doing what he wanted. 

I'm feeling pretty emotionally hungover and upset about the situation. I feel so angry for her. I feel so angry about my history.

ezrrak,Why does abuser dump me after I leave first?,"After he got violent during sex the other night (he's violent in general) I left to go home straight away and distanced myself from him and tried to move on mentally then 2 days later or so he texted me asking what's going on, then after texted again saying we should just be friends, then texted a bunch of question marks then asked me for alcohol ( I don't drink). I didn't respond to this then the next day I spoke to him in person and he told me he doesn't want me and to not speak to him again and I brought up him being violent and he just said to shut up basically.

ezv4cr,"Gf is being physically abused by her mother, how can I get her out?","Some backstory:

- She lives in Puerto Rico, I live in the US

- She's 23, just graduated college but despite applying to a ton of places locally, can't pick up a job

- Due to above, she was forced to move in with her mother and is now financially dependent on her

- Context on her mother: Gf just went to the hospital last night with multiple broken ribs, internal bleeding etc because of her mother (she's still there right now); passed out from pain/blood loss within an hour (fortunately still got to the doctor in time)

She doesn't have a penny to her name and wants to leave PR, and especially her mother, but doesn't know how because the only family she has stateside (NY) she hadn't spoken to in years until recently (she's been trying to reach out to them and develop a rapport with before just asking if she can move in with them but that's taking time she doesn't have).

B) Get her a place to live here?

ezvlk6,Concerned For Neighbor,"I’ve searched through other posts like this but could use some advice specific to this situation... My wife and I got new neighbors a couple months ago and have woken up twice to hysterical sobbing, with someone saying ""get the fuck away from me."" The first time this happened, I woke up disoriented and confused because I did not think anyone even lived in the apartment next to us, so I went and knocked on the door. The woman who answered played it off, saying her girlfriend was drunk and upset about losing her job. This didn't seem right to me, but I exchanged numbers with her and decided to keep an ear out in the future. 

Last night, I again overheard loud crying. I put my ear to the wall and took notes on what I heard, and it went something like ""Stop. What are you doing? Get off of me! What's the point of this? Stop touching me. Why are you touching me! *ow!*"" I heard a growl from their dog, followed by ""I don't know why it has to hurt... why are you like this... I don't know why you had to wake me up... you just had to grab my hair and I wasn't even doing anything wrong... I made you late? for what? There's no point to this. I don't understand. I was sleeping fine. You just woke me up and had to be a fucking asshole. Stop touching me."" I did hear thuds that could be objects being thrown, but it was faint and unclear.

I am 100% sure there is abuse going on, but there has never been clearly audible violence that creates enough of a disturbance where I am confident that calling the police is the right move. I'm also conflicted because I've heard that involving law enforcement can make things worse for the victim if their abuser takes it out on them. I know the victim just moved from out of state, has no friends here and no job, and considering they are a very young lesbian couple, there's also a possibility that they do not have family to turn to either. I do not think she has a clear way out and I would not want to make her living situation worse for her.

I have reached out to building management to let them know that I am concerned about my neighbors and also asked if it would be possible to get their contact info. I never see the victim in the hall without her partner and have no way of speaking to her one on one, but if I get her number I would like to let her know that we are a safe place that she can come if she ever needs to. 

Am I doing the right thing by holding off on calling the cops for now?

ezyowj,8 month anniversary - Survivor post!,"Hi all,   


I almost can't believe I'm writing this. I left my abuser on June 6th, 2019 - so today is my 8 month anniversary. I can't wait to celebrate at one year :)  


About a year ago, it was my 25th and spending the weekend with all my friends at a beach house. I was excited to bring my boyfriend to meet all my friends. He (he always had health problems - now I really question how legitimate they are) get very, very sick, and insisted I take him (alone) to the ER. I didn't have my car, and I wanted one of my friends to drive us there. he insisted I go there alone with him. I spent my birthday alone with him, in the ER, somewhere in New York, missing my friends (who flew in from around the US/the world to get together). 

He wouldn't let me dance anymore, kept me apart from my friends as much as possible, and constantly said negative things about my family that I started believing. In the morning, I couldn't go to the bathroom, even though I'd always wake up before him. I had to stay in bed and just hold it. His diets were always extreme (like he was either living purely on junk food, or eating super healthy with no bread/coffee/potatoes/etc.) Whatever diet he was on, I had to go along with it - my weight totally yoyo'd all year.   


We fought constantly about laundry. I enjoyed doing laundry at my parents house - it's free, they live around the corner, and it's a good excuse to spend time with them. He wanted us to go to a laundromat. I later realized this was only to keep me from seeing my parents.   


He manipulated me into buying a house. He'd frequently ""confiscate"" my phone and my car keys if I wasn't paying enough attention to him. I'd have to negotiate for how long I was allowed to leave the house for. To this day - what I love the most is being able to stay out as late as I want! 

  
He forced me to take sleeping pills I didn't need, and now I'm dependent on them. I lost 10s of thousands of dollars by buying a house with him. He convinced me I had severe mental illness and got me to see a psychiatrist. I started taking ADHD meds I didn't need. (I do not have mental illness and never have). 

&amp;#x200B;

He gaslit me HARD. I never knew what was real and what wasn't. The first time he choked me and slammed me into the wall in the living room, I wasn't sure what had happened. I asked him about it later, and he said that it never happened, that I imagined it. It wasn't until I left him and started getting therapy that I realized - it did happen, and it was real. I can still feel his thumbs pressed against the front of my neck. 

&amp;#x200B;

He forced us to be homeless for 7 months. Do you know how hard it was to get ready for work in the morning? He airbnbd our apartment, and later our house, and kept all the money, and in the meantime, forced me to live in terrible conditions. 

He actually broke up with me. He wanted me to give him $17,000, and told me he'd break up with me if I refused. So- I refused. I didn't have the money anyway. Later, he told me he'd ""forgive me"" and we could stay together. I am SO glad I had friends who helped me see the truth - because I almost went back.   


I wish I had known that couples counseling is not helpful, and it's counterproductive. We saw a couples therapist, and I definitely stayed with him for about 6 months longer because the therapist always agreed with him, on every point. She always sided with him (he was very manipulative). Couples counseling is actually NOT recommended in cases of DV and it can make things worse:  [https://www.thehotline.org/2014/08/01/why-we-dont-recommend-couples-counseling-for-abusive-relationships/](https://www.thehotline.org/2014/08/01/why-we-dont-recommend-couples-counseling-for-abusive-relationships/)   


In November I made an appointment with this therapist and just yelled at her for like 20 minutes. I gave her articles and a book to read. I described all the ways in which her lack of professionalism hurt me. It was great - she listened, and I really think she took it to heart.   


Here's another great article on gaslighting: [https://www.thehotline.org/2014/05/29/what-is-gaslighting/](https://www.thehotline.org/2014/05/29/what-is-gaslighting/)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not truly ""out of the woods"" until I finish my taxes for this year. I hope I can get that wrapped up soon. For anyone who is going through something similar (or if you think you might be) get HELP. Get perspective. Spend some time alone in the woods (seriously, that's what helped me).   


But most of all, get out. Life with an abuser will always feel like struggling to stay afloat. It took me about a month to truly believe I was being abused (and that was with literally dozens of people shouting it at me!)   


Life has gotten so much better. I'm still dealing with a lot of financial shit and I'm terrified of men (and was raped while I was sleeping, very shortly after breaking up with him, by someone else) but things are so so much better when you escape your abuser.

f01wxd,"Please, save yourself.","I left an abusive relationship 8 months ago. There were many times I feared for my life. Two days ago, my friend Sabrina lost hers. The following is from the news report;

Pa State Police have charged 24 year old Nicholas F***** with first-degree murder and third-degree murder of Sabrina H****** of Gilbertsville.
According to the affidavit of probable cause, Forman told police Sabrina was in a fight with three females at the PJ Whelihans in Oaks, Pa. 
Further investigation gleaned F***** was arguing with H****** in an Uber after leaving PJ Whelihans over a text message. The driver heard her say to him, ""You’re scaring me.” The Uber driver dropped them off at Formans address in Perkiomen late Sunday evening or early Monday morning where he noticed them arguing and him throwing something. 
A search warrant lists items like “clumps of hair” and clothing with “suspected blood stain” taken from inside and outside the residence. 
State Police witnesses say F***** transported H****** to the Pottstown Hospital Monday morning by calling an Uber at 9:45am. The Uber driver had no idea she was dead.
One recording from his phone shows Sabrina lying in a grassy area. In the recording he is heard saying, “This is what a cheating liar gets. You hear me? Cheating f****** liar. Dirty a** c***. Dirty a** bitch. You dirty a** lying a** bitch.”
The recording ends after he finished his statement.

My heart is aching. Her family is broken inside. Her friends are mourning. And she is gone.
I remember that feeling all too well, when a man starts to hit you again and all you can wonder is, ""am I going to die this time?""

f0281p,Resentment towards my [25F] mother [39F],"Lately I’ve [25F] been going through lot of emotions regarding my mother [39F], my sister [16F] and my upbringing. Growing up my mother has been in multiple abusive relationships. 3 of them that were really long and horrible. I have seen my mother get dragged, punched, spit on, sexually exploited around her boyfriends friends, and embarrassed at home and in public. 

As a kid I would have serious break downs and be so embarrassed from seeing my mom get hit in public &amp; at home. Emotionally, I was drained. I would be scared to come home after school because I feared that I would see my mother dead, getting hit, or arguing. Her boyfriends were never too fond of me and one of them, the one who she was in a relationship with the longest, would also hit me and make advances toward me. I ended up running away from home at 17 and I have been on my own since then but I still kept in contact with my mom and my sister. I have strong feelings of hate sometimes for my mom. I love her but I hate that she didn’t stick up for herself or at least for her kids and I hate that she allowed us to see such bad things our WHOLE life. I can’t trust men at all for the things that I’ve seen. I feel that my view of the world and relationships is ruined because of her. My mom was attracted to bad guys and abusers. She moved very quickly with men &amp; we were stuck having to see different men abuse her and us. 

 My little sister has also been a victim of seeing the abuse. She’s young and doesn’t know how to react to the things my mom has allowed to happen so she has began acting out. She’ll leave the house for weeks, the longest time was 2 months, just to make my mother worry about her and to hurt her. She has become very promiscuous and openly involved with older men. I am not judging my sister at all for what she does with her body but it hurts because I know she’s doing it in retaliation to what she feels inside. She’s seeking love and attention from men who are using her. I wish I could stop it but i don’t want her to feel like I’m policing her body and then she cuts off communication with me. She’s still a kid and needs guidance but she doesn’t want people to tell her what to do. She tells me everything and though I really hate what she’s doing, I need her to keep telling me what she’s doing and know that I’m here for her. 

I am scared for her and for what she will end up doing. Every time my mom tries to do mother daughter activity with her or talk to her she blatantly disrespects her and it boils my blood. I know I have harsh feelings buried deep for my mom but I still don’t disrespect her because she’s experienced that enough in her life. There has been 3 occasions where I have almost really put my hands on my sister for disrespecting my mom the way that she does. Those incidents made me realize I needed to go to therapy because I didn’t want to be a person who used violence to express anger. So I’ve just started therapy a week ago. 

My mom has not been in a relationship for  4 years and is celibate now. She’s been trying her best to find herself and create a better relationship with us and I appreciate that. She had me really young and didn’t have any guidance and protection so I somewhat understand why she couldn’t provide that for us but it still hurts a lot. 

I feel like our anger is misplaced because we know our mom was the victim but to what extent ? Why didn’t she ever even try to leave these guys or stand up for us? Why were their needs before ours? She has emotional issues from her past and I understand that, which is why I have more sympathy in my heart than my sister does. It took me to grow up and have a baby to understand that before my mom is my mother, she’s her own woman and she is human and she’s gonna make mistakes. I just would really like advice on everything. Forgiving my mother. Helping my sister with her wild behavior and trying to help her forgive my mom. I feel like I’m carrying the weight of the entire family on my shoulders.",biancaserenity,2020-02-06 16:36:03,2,785,17.3,69.48,37.62,3.16,18.26,12.48,94.9,62.42,24.59,19.87,10.7,1.4,0,7.39,0.38,4.71,2.8,13.76,11.46,5.1,7.9,1.66,20.89,2.93,2.17,2.17,0.89,1.53,5.86,1.66,4.08,0.89,1.53,0.51,19.49,3.95,0.89,11.21,1.15,13.38,2.8,2.8,2.04,1.66,1.15,3.44,2.8,1.02,0,1.66,2.29,0.89,0.51,0.25,0.25,8.15,4.08,1.02,2.17,0.89,0.64,4.59,13.38,0.89,11.59,1.91,5.35,4.33,0.25,0.38,0.76,0,0,0.25,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,0,12.48,4.97,1.91,0,0.25,0.38,0,0,0,3.44,0,1.53

f06je8,Help with memory loss ??,"I had an abusive childhood (i say the term loosely, it was when I was 11-16yo or so) and my memory has progressively gotten worse. I was previously diagnosed with PTSD and never completed therapy (too expensive). 

It started as losing memories from childhood to now I can even remember what I did recently (i.e. did I eat today and if so what, regularly scheduled times for daily activities, what I’ve done and not done this week). 

Certain memories that seem so clear to me in my head only to be told that a some conversations/occurrences never happened. I often dream vividly that I can recall my dreams in great detail and mix them up with things that actually happened. 

I have always been intellectually inclined and excelled in school, but I’ve increasingly found myself struggling for common words and remembering basic  academic concepts that would’ve come naturally to me before. 

My relationships and studies have taken some major nosedives and it’s stressful not being able to explain why I just can’t remember anything. My family used to joke that I have the memory of an elephant and now I’m lucky to remember what I did today.

f08laj,It’s 5 am and I’m icing my eye,"I’ve been in a relationship with him 3 years but known him more than half my life. I never thought when we started dating that it would come to this. He’s been hitting me and I’ve been making excuses but I think ppl are starting to suspect what’s going on. We don’t live together anymore but we’re planning to soon and now I just want to move and not tell him where me and our kid are moving to. 

He punched me in the eye twice because I asked him why he was late and why the seat was leaked back in my car when he picked me up from work. Unbeknownst to me he had been drinking. I was seeing double at first but it resolved after a few minutes. When he was driving to the place he’s staying he kept apologizing. He tried to hug me when he got out which I didn’t return. He apologized again saying he needs therapy (which I agree with). All I could say was “you’re always sorry afterwards but you keep doing it. You could have permanently destroyed my vision.” But I started crying so I got in the driver seat and left him standing there. He’s been texting me since I got home but I can’t even respond. I’m so tired of this. Now I have to go to work with a swollen eye and lie some more about how it happened. 

I love him but I hate him at the same time. And it’s clear he doesn’t love me. I need to get away but I’m scared.

f09rzb,He’s Finally in Rehab,"I have posted on here before about my abuser and his drug addiction and how it has affected my daughter and I. She was removed from his apartment during a drug bust when she was there for a visit, and wasn’t sent back home to me because I became homeless because of his previous abuse. He held my daughter and I hostage and beat me unconscious and left lasting physical and mental damage. I have to wear glasses because he damaged my eye so badly. He never should have had visitation with her. All of this led to both of us being put in Family Court and my daughter is with my mom until I secure housing. Well he was doing well in Family Court for a little while and he was allowed visitation again. My mom was supervising the visits and told me that she suspected he was using again but didn’t tell the court because his parents are paying her for taking care of my daughter. When I saw him nodding out in the courtroom, I knew he had relapsed. I told everyone I could and everyone said that I was lying. I have been beyond frustrated with the system. His caseworker is his old boss that used to cover for him when he got high at work. He eventually got fired and so did she. I repeatedly complained that this was a conflict of interest and nobody agreed. I was getting sick of nobody believing that he was using again because I had no evidence.

Finally the court believes me because when my mom took my daughter to visit him this weekend he was visibly high. He acts crazy and makes weird noises when he is using because he has mental difficulties to begin with. My daughter saw him like that and told me that she was sad that she couldn’t see her Dad because “He was acting crazy on drugs again.” This broke my heart. He admitted to my mom that he was on heroin and was going into rehab. He is there now and he is still ahead of me in the Family Court process because I just recently moved into the county. Because he admitted that he relapsed I am afraid that the court is going to continue to take his side. I am glad he is in rehab, but this just proves that he can only stay clean for a short while before he goes back to drugs. He has been using since he was 18 and this is his 10th time in rehab. I have never used drugs, never been arrested, and never hurt my children in any way. I want to be relieved that the court found out he was using, but where I live, drug users have a lot of rights. There is even a medically assisted injection site here! I raised my little girl for 5 years and I can’t believe this is even happening. They don’t even take into account the years of documented abuse against us! Please pray for my daughter and I, I know I can get her back even living here in the safe house because there are children here. I just feel like the system is failing me.",hidmay83,2020-02-07 04:25:13,1,548,10.28,64.26,32.33,5.92,17.12,14.23,93.43,63.87,23.36,18.8,9.12,0.36,0,9.12,0.18,4.56,3.47,11.13,10.95,8.21,8.58,2.19,20.99,3.28,0.91,1.28,0.36,0.73,5.47,1.82,3.65,0.18,0.91,0.73,15.88,2.92,0,4.01,7.48,10.58,2.37,4.38,0.73,0.36,1.64,1.28,1.64,0.91,0.36,0.36,3.47,0.55,2.92,0,0,5.29,1.09,0.73,1.82,1.46,0.73,9.31,9.12,0.91,15.33,2.19,6.39,7.48,1.09,0.73,1.28,0.36,0.18,0,0.36,0,0,0,0.36,0,8.58,5.29,1.46,0,0,0,0.36,0,0.36,1.09,0,0
f0aqsd,Saw my abuser at a hospital I used to work at. I’m feeling very shaken up.,"Hey guys, just a h/u, I’m on mobile, so I apologize for the formatting. Also TW for sexual assault. This just happened last night and I’m still pretty fucked up about it, so I’m sorry if my thoughts are a bit scrambled.

Here’s some background; I’m an EMT on a private ambulance. Last year, I dated a security guard from a local hospital for a month. He was sexually abusive and scarred me emotionally. The first night I met him, he told me he loved me. I was so eager to be loved that I fell hook, line and sinker into the trap. I’m not going to get into the nitty gritty details about what happened, but I will say there were some times he hurt me so bad when we were in bed together that I legitimately thought I should go to the ER, but I never did. I chose to stay with him because I so badly wanted to be loved, or at least to hear someone say I love you to me. At the end of the relationship, we had a fight and he broke up with me.

A few months ago, I was in an outpatient hospitalization program for PTSD and an eating disorder. I wasn’t doing well, I had nightmares, panic attacks, and I just in general didn’t feel safe. Through my time in program, I was able to gather enough strength to go to the police and report what happened. I now have a detective assigned to my case who has been extremely helpful. My detective said the ex has done some of the same things he did to me before to other girls who also reported it. Although I don’t have a lot of cold, hard proof, the fact that this has happened before could strengthen my case.

Last night, I was on shift. We were assigned a lift assist call at a hospital I used to work at. I was pretty excited to go to that hospital, because it usually means I get to see one of my best friends who works security there. We pull around in front of the ER and I see my best friend and a couple other security guards (more like I saw a couple guys in security vests, couldn’t make out faces or anything). So, I make a mad dash to my best friend to give him a huge hug, like we usually do. I make it to the door and see my ex in the huddle. My heart stopped and my brain raced. My best friend came to me and walked me outside where I just completely lost it. For a few minutes, all I could say was “that’s him.” My best friend knew of the situation and who my ex was. He hugged me and said “I know, I know.” We walked to my ambulance and kind of stood in silence for a bit while I sobbed and he hugged me. 

After quite a bit of this, I got back in my ambulance and we went to go find our other crew. My partner, having seen everything that went down, asked what happened and I explained. He told me to stay in the ambulance while he helped the other crew with the patient. While he was helping, I sat in the ambulance sobbing and panicking. My partner was a great support, although he wasn’t supposed to, he drove us to the destination where we helped the other crew and drove us back to the garage.

I finally got home, took my anxiety meds and knocked out. Waking up this morning was tough. I want so badly to believe it was just a nightmare, that it didn’t happen in reality. I don’t want to believe that he works at that hospital or that I’ll ever see him again there. It’s really messing me up because that hospital was my safe haven. I have my best friend there and I know it like the back of my hand. It’s one thing when I know I’m going somewhere I know he works and can prepare myself, but I was completely blindsided by this. To make things worse, my boyfriend lives a couple blocks away from the hospital he works at now and I feel so sick knowing whenever I go to his house, my ex may well be a few blocks away.

I thought I was getting better. My panic attacks started to diminish and I haven’t had a horrible one for months. I haven’t had nightmares for a while. I feel like all my progress went down the drain. I am so mad at myself for letting him still control me, I don’t know why he has such a big impact on me, nearly a year after the relationship. I’m just really hurting and thrown off. I don’t know what to do. Does anyone have any advice or wise words?",rosieposieollieoh,2020-02-07 05:51:11,2,840,34.45,31.28,88.91,31.88,16.15,13.57,93.69,61.07,22.74,17.14,12.74,1.31,0.24,2.86,0,5.48,6.79,12.98,8.69,6.55,6.79,1.55,20.36,3.93,2.26,1.67,0.48,2.14,7.62,3.93,3.57,0.71,1.07,0.83,10.83,0,1.67,0.12,3.21,10.95,2.62,1.31,0.95,2.74,1.19,2.86,2.86,0.95,0.83,1.07,2.74,0.48,1.31,0.36,0.12,10.83,4.29,2.02,2.86,1.9,1.31,8.81,10.12,0.83,13.93,2.5,6.55,5.48,1.9,0.12,0.6,0,0,0,1.31,0.12,0.12,0,0.48,0,14.52,6.07,4.52,0,0.12,0.12,0,0,0.48,2.86,0.24,0.12
f0bf6h,A woman (23F) I (24M) love and grew up with is being abused by her partner (25M) and will not or cannot leave him.,"I made this account to seek some advice on how to handle this situation. Here goes:

My childhood friend (23F) since primary school and I (24M) ended up going to our instate medical university together. We went to primary through high school together and have always remained close as our families are friends. I have watched this girl grow up and in all honesty I have surpassed loving her. I truly respect her. And my respect for her grows daily. She is smart, kind, drop dead gorgeous and can make an entire room laugh from their stomachs without insulting or putting anyone else at the butt of a joke. And after so many years of knowing her, I still have not grown tired of her. I say this all to say, she is an absolute catch on all fronts and as a result she has always seemed to be the target of more or less dickhead men who take advantage of her non-malice, but she is so utterly kind that she cannot even see this for herself. She has been dating a man who is in my medical school class while she is pursuing a masters at the university and I know from sheer observation that this man is an absolute tool. However, despite this I never assumed he was cruel, until recently. They have been dating for almost two years now and I have seen the way he treat her slowly deteriorate over the past year. I do not know him on a personal level, but he constantly makes jokes about her being inferior to him because she was ""not smart enough"" to handle medical school. This guy has a way of making his jokes seem harmless to everyone around us, but knowing her for so long I can see the way his comments hurt her despite her laughing along. He has told her to sit with him instead of introducing herself to her peers, has isolated her from them, and constantly comments on things that are not even remotely true, calling her selfish for staying in to study instead of going out with him, almost yelling at her when she does not understand concepts and asks her peers for help, telling her to ""stop embarrassing him"", and even make crude sexual jokes about her, etc. However, his actions in private are what scare me the most. I eavesdropped on her telling him she did not want to go home after ""what happened the other night"" and him telling her ""I barely touched you and even if I did, you deserved what you had coming to you"". This is a woman that is one of the most altruistic and caring people I have ever met. A woman that spent two years of her life as a volunteer abroad. A woman that would not even hurt a fly. What finally broke me was seeing her take off a long sleeve jacket momentarily and seeing bruises all along her arm. I immediately asked her what happened to which she said she ""fell down the stairs"" and I knew off the bat she was lying. I pressed her and even asked her if he was hitting her to which she simply stayed silent. I told her she needed to leave him or call the cops, but she immediately said that she could not do that and that it was not him. Over time I started becoming more observant, and saw him grabbing her arms forcefully when he thought no one could see, shoving her, her coming in with long sleeve shirts everyday. The day she walked in with a black eye so bad her makeup could not cover it in the slightest and her tell everyone she ""fell down the stairs"" it was pretty clear. I decided to tip the cops off anonymously. She came to me the next day, asked to see me in private, and broke down sobbing telling me she could not leave and that I made things worse for her as he became more violent after the cops showed up at their residence. She told me he made her deny it to the police and that there was no reason to call the cops and when I pressed her to what he has on her she simply said she could not tell me and begged me to stay out of this.

Am I overreaching? The worst part of this is this is only the abuse I am aware of and don't even want to think about things I may be missing. I'm at a loss of what to do. Is this really none of my business? Truthfully, the only thing keeping me from putting this guy in the ground is me not wanting to make anything worse for her. He clearly has something over her that is keeping her from leaving him, though what that is I have no clue. If she keeps denying it to police, is there anything I can do?

TLDR: A woman I have known since childhood is being abused but will not leave him due to fear/his threats/some unknown blackmail he has on her. He is forcing her to deny anything happening. Am I overreaching? How can I help her if she denies this to law enforcement? How can I keep things from escalating?",nervousforher,2020-02-07 06:45:53,1,918,26.51,76.72,9.64,19.28,21.86,14.16,94.12,62.85,24.18,17.76,5.34,0.44,0.44,11.11,0.44,6.43,4.68,13.4,9.04,5.23,6.75,2.61,19.61,3.49,1.85,1.96,0.44,1.74,5.66,2.51,2.94,0.44,0.98,0.98,19.06,0.11,0.54,8.61,3.7,12.96,1.96,1.85,1.53,2.83,2.07,4.47,3.05,1.42,0.98,0.65,1.42,0.65,0.54,0.11,0,6.1,1.85,0.33,3.38,0.44,0.76,5.99,10.46,0.76,14.05,3.27,6.32,4.9,1.42,0.54,0.44,0.33,0,0.11,0.33,0.22,0.11,0,0,0,10.68,3.92,2.94,0.22,0,0.65,0,0.11,1.31,0.22,1.09,0.22

f0oqte,Update about abuser dumping me. He's contacting me.,"So as my last post says he got violent with me during sex  and strangled me to the point I started having a panic attacks. He did things I didn't consent to. so I left in the middle of it and went home. He texted me within the days after asking what's going on, then saying it's best if we're friends. then the morning after that saying that he doesn't want me, etc. I haven't had contact with him since that morning now days later his texts have started up again asking if I need help with buying groceries and demanding an answer basically. I can tell he's going to get real nasty soon. He used to threaten to have me put In a mental hospital or have my cat taken from me. I'm worried about him starting those threats again or doing something. I'm too scared to get an order on him as he took videos of me when I was crying and yelling after he deprived me of sleep all night. And other trying to get his phone off him because he kept filming me in the middle of the night while keeping me awake while I was pregnant.  And he says I'll just look like the crazy one. I can't block his number as my phone won't let me so I need to buy a new SIM or contact the phone company. I'm going to end up having a mental breakdown soon. My neck just recovered. I was in pain in bed for days. I'm struggling with food money but I'm not going anywhere near him. And I hate living in this house but I'm not moving back in with him as he's been asking for weeks. I'm Litterely not going to go near him or he will kill me. I'm surprised he didn't the other night.

f0xhl8,"Ex’s emotional abuse is getting worse, starting to mention ways he’d kill our animals","I’m in a situation where I recently left my infant son’s father after 7 years of emotional abuse. He still comes into mine (and my mother’s) home two days a week because he does not live in a place that’s suitable for our son to stay. I’m working two days a week and living with her until I can get on my feet. 

He does not respect my boundaries (just wanting to be left alone) and I will likely end up avoiding the home altogether beyond work. He doesn’t bother my mom and she avoids him. When he tries to converse with me or I overhear stuff he says, it’s often angry and impatient in tone. 

The most alarming thing to me is how he has started to mention ways he’d kill our cats when they misbehave. It’s now beyond a simple “ugh I could just kill them” and has only been a thing for a month or two? He told one of them he’d hang them by their feet in the garage, punt them down the hall, etc. 

He’s never been violent with me, but he hit his mother as a teenager and is often violent with himself. He has borderline personality disorder and bipolar, and has attempted suicide twice. At this point, would I see signs that violence is happening to my son or cats, or could potentially happen to me? I sometimes get chills up my spine thinking about kidnapping in retaliation, or him losing it and all of us perishing. I don’t have much extra income, but would nanny cams maybe be a good investment? How could I hide them?

I’m hoping I’m just being a paranoid new mom.",throwawayaway8392,2020-02-08 12:48:46,18,298,19.04,66.87,29.59,1,17.53,15.1,92.28,58.39,21.81,18.79,8.39,1.34,0,6.71,2.35,3.02,4.7,11.74,12.08,6.04,8.05,1.68,19.8,4.7,1.68,1.68,2.01,1.34,8.39,1.34,7.05,1.68,3.02,0.67,16.11,3.02,0,2.01,7.38,10.07,0.34,1.01,2.35,4.36,1.01,3.02,1.01,0.34,0.67,0,2.35,1.01,1.34,0,0,8.39,1.68,1.68,2.01,1.34,2.01,2.01,12.42,1.01,15.1,1.01,7.05,7.38,1.34,0.34,1.34,0.67,0,1.34,0.34,0,0,0,0.34,0,16.11,4.03,3.36,0,0,1.34,0,0,0.67,5.37,1.34,0

f124h2,A Book That Might Help,"My wife, who is a domestic violence survivor, and I collaborated on a picture book for women and children escaping domestic violence. Val wanted a book to exist to help mothers answer their children's questions at an extremely stressful time. The book may also assist women in identifying partner behaviors that are warning signs of violence before a relationship gets serious. In any case, we just wanted to do something to help. We're working to raise awareness of the book with shelter organizations, health care providers, libraries, etc., so that victims of domestic violence can have access to it for free. Profit is not our goal. In the meantime, our picture book is available on Amazon, as a Kindle eBook and paperback. It's called ""Escape from the Mad Man: For Your First Nights of Freedom"". Here's the link to it on Amazon if you'd like to have a look. We hope it helps you. Please be safe.

f1ixz3,My boyfriend hates me. I really think he does.,"Long post ahead. Mentions of sexual situations and domestic violence. Please excuse the jumbled writing as 
A) I am on mobile, and 
B) I'm writing this drunk and through tears.

Ok, so to start off, when I say I think he hates me... I really do. Not an exaggeration. 
He never, ever kisses me. He doesn't hug me. He barely even looks up from his video games.
Any time I talk to him I'm always wrong about something. Ex:
Me: that was a nice movie.

Him: of course you'd think that, but what should I expect from someone so simple?

Shit like that . And whenever we argue even a little he will gaslight me. Saying what initially happened to make me upset was all in my head, or because I'm Autistic I just wanted to start a fuss. 
Saying that because my father was abusive and my mother was addicted to opioids for a few years that I'm a ""bad seed"".. me and my mother have a very healthy relationship and I haven't spoken to my father in over ten years.  (even though he was the same... For longer, and his family never got help....)


He makes me feel like I'm at fault for the house being a mess even when I have been gone all day.  He never asks about my day.
All he does all day is play  Red Dead Redemption 2 or Ghost Recon Breakpoint, or eat food. When he's upset with the games, especially online modes, he will scream at the top of his lungs, break things and yell at me to pick them up or clean it immediately,  and get mad when I flinch, then yell at me. He hasn't hesitated raising his fist. He's paralyzed half of my face before. (If you want to know, the long story short is he gave me bells palsey because he hit me in the face for not getting him enough birthday gifts, a few days later I woke to a pain in my face and half of it wouldn't move. He laughed at me.) He gets mad that I can't buy him a new 4k tv, new video games, new controllers, PC... Even though I'm going through school right now!!! I barely have enough to feed myself. As if I'm even obligated to get him a damn entertainment system!! He doesn't have a job nor is he on disability. 

I have a problem with my nose, I get nose bleeds but  I cough up the blood quite often due to it dripping down my throat. When this happens he accuses me of using blood capsules to get attention. He took pictures and put it on Snapchat one time saying, "" oh look, *myname* is pulling her silly little pranks again!""

I had a seizure and he didn't bat an eye. 



He has never taken me on a real date in the 3 years we've been together.

He talks to anybody and everyone he can about how inattentive I am.

He uses my secrets against me. My childhood abuse? He said I must have liked it and I'm at fault for it happening to me for not immediately reporting. My history with drug abuse? He holds that over my head at every chance. 


Every time we try to get intimate anymore he just pretty much, to save being graphic, gets it over with for himself and doesn't pay any mind to me. Not to mention half the time it ends up in a fight because I won't give him a play- by - play on what to do to me. I don't enjoy it anymore and I'm barely even attracted to him.

He's every horrible thing a man can be so why does it pain me to want to leave him? Why? Oh my God why?",cruoreye,2020-02-09 17:40:29,5,645,22.95,39,48.5,6.66,12.65,11.01,93.95,59.69,23.26,18.6,10.7,0.47,0.31,6.98,0.16,4.65,4.81,12.87,8.99,6.82,6.98,2.95,17.98,3.57,1.4,2.02,1.09,1.86,6.98,2.64,4.34,0.62,2.02,0.16,13.8,0.78,0.31,0.47,7.44,12.4,1.09,2.17,1.55,3.1,2.48,3.41,3.57,1.24,1.55,0.47,4.03,2.17,1.24,0.16,0.62,6.82,2.17,0.47,1.86,1.71,0.93,3.41,12.09,1.09,14.11,0.93,5.58,7.29,1.24,2.17,0.47,0.31,0.16,0.31,1.24,0.31,0.31,0.16,0.31,0,19.84,8.06,3.57,0.47,0,0.93,0.93,0.31,0.62,3.72,0.93,0.31
f1jpxw,Adult CPSTD Survivor of IPV/DV,"I’ve tried EMDR and it feels like reiki (fakey). I’m currently trying IFS therapy but curious what adult children who witnessed their moms abused do to become whole, not fearful, and secure. 

I’m almost 40 and live in a world I feel is completely unsafe and filled with doom. I’ve only found the hormonal response to intense romantic passion to balance me and make me feel safe. It tanks my relationships. I either fear rejection when intensely into someone and subconsciously push them away and test their tolerance until they break and a self fulfilling prophecy occurs. Other times I date people with whom passion doesn’t exist and it’s completely safe but that safety fades and I feel I’m a prisoner in a passionless and sexless relationship. 

I’m tired of pathology books and videos showing causal relationships between my trauma and it’s effects on me and need/want how to heal and overcome - workbook, authors, videos, therapy styles etc.

This is where I need help. She said: there is no evidence that there is any abuse in dad's house now NOR THAT THERE HAS EVER BEEN ABUSE in dad's house. Then she said that I have demonstrated a persistent pattern of deliberate deception by insisting to authority figures since the divorce, including her, that my ex is aggressive, and that is part of my alienating behavior. 

WHAT IS HAPPENING. 

She has the police reports. The pictures of the bruises. The CPS reports. How could she 1) believe that there was never abuse in his house but more importantly 2) believe that I was being deceptive when I say he's aggressive. It's not deceptive if I believe it or if it is TRUE. 

I feel really unseen.

f1tjm3,I hit him,"Hey guys,

I just wanted to share this out of guilt and maybe get some advice at the same time. 

My husband and I have been married for 2 years. I have always been a very angry person but I never actually hurt anyone, I would just kick doors or punch walls or exercise to get it all out. I know it’s probably not a normal thing, maybe especially for a woman (?) but that’s just how it is. 

My relationship with my husband was great and nothing ever got physical until after I gave birth to our daughter. It may have been the stress, lack of sleep and the fact that I no longer had time or energy to let the anger out the safe way. But I noticed that every time we fight I just could not control my anger and started out with pushing him or hitting his chest to keep him away from me. 

About a few months ago, we had a really big fight and I kicked him in the stomach and just about almost punched him in the face to keep him away from me. I say keep him away from me not that he’s actually hurting me, but he was trying to calm me down by keeping me from throwing shit and trying to hug me...

I know that I was wrong and I’ve apologized to him and we haven’t fought ever since and I still feel like absolute shit. Like how could I? What happened that made me lose my mind enough to actually hit him?! 

I don’t know what to say or think and it’s taken me this long to even write this. I’m so ashamed that I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about it.

f22vzf,when your abuser uses you defending yourself as reason to continue what do you do?,"example; he will yell at me, push me, verbally abuse me. if I yell back he says that ""it's a trigger"" and that's what makes him hit me. and that if I pull his hair or push him off or scream it ""makes him want to hurt me more"" and the reason he keeps on is because ""you did it first"" and I ""shouldnt have yelled"" ESPECIALLY if I cry. if I cry during physical abuse he will bump it up 100x. 

basically he wants me to sit there and let him abuse me and wants me to just not scream? how do you not scream when someone is hitting you? how do you not cry? 

if I'm not smiling happy and praising him, I'm ""triggering"" him. 

tonight we argued just like my example, and I asked to sleep alone. as soon as I fell asleep he woke me up, to ""apologoze"" but the second he woke me up I started having a anxiety attack and my vision was spinning. but I know if I ask him to leave me alone it'll start more so I just accepted the apology quickly and he left while I dealt with the attack. I just can't fall back asleep without venting a little. 

I know the simple answer is leave. 
but obviously it's more complex than that. 
I want to. but right now I'm just venting.

f2454j,Seeking advice on how to approach a coworker who seems to be in an abusive relationship.,"I am looking for advice about how to try to help a woman with whom I work. She, by the account of others and a comment made by her, seems to be in a physically abusive relationship. She and I are friendly at work, but by no means friends in any real sense. The comment she made was one I overheard about how he ""beat the shit out of her"" &amp; the things she has told me directly are that she pays all the bills and that he is very controlling, and that he makes comments about her appearance. 

As background, my job is as a server in a high end steakhouse. I used to work there about four years ago, but I only returned in November. I have been making an effort to keep to myself as much as possible, most of the people I work are young and entitled assholes who lack any compassion and do a lot of drinking, drugs, and gambling. My coworker has a reputation as a complainer, but a good worker. 

Several weeks ago she had kicked him out of her apartment, and said that they had broken up. My response when she mentioned it to me directly was that I was glad because nobody should ever be hit &amp; should feel safe, but she didn't respond to that. 

A couple of weeks ago she posted on Facebook about how her xBF ""bought"" her a vacation to Punta Cana, so I asked her about it when I saw her next. She at first said that they weren't back together, but going on vacation together, then almost immediately said that she was lying &amp; hadn't wanted to ""admit defeat"" because they were back together. That he had used her money to book this vacation without consulting her &amp; then presented it as a gift. I didn't say anything at the time because others were around &amp; she began speaking to someone else. 

Yesterday I went into work &amp; someone asked me what happened with her, that she has left crying. I hadn't seen her so I asked someone who was working with her &amp; they said, with an eyeroll, that she ""got beat up"" the night before by her BF, so she had to go. 

My question is two fold, how do I offer her help? I don't know if she sees this as DV, or how seriously unacceptable it is to be abused by a partner, or if this is a lifelong cycle she deems normal. She does not seems happy. I'm a very awkward person, I'm not good at making friends and really try not to engage with my co-workers on a deeper level than work. This is very uncomfortable for me but I recognize that I really should say something. 

My other question is how to deal with my co-workers who have no compassion for her. They see it as she was asking for it by taking him back, which is not only awful, but untrue. Do you have any points I can hit when explaining to these people that she still deserves safety and compassion even if she has gone back repeatedly?",bekahed979,2020-02-10 22:00:49,4,547,23.07,73.9,19.8,15.48,21.88,14.44,95.06,62.71,22.67,15.17,6.22,0,0.18,7.86,0.91,7.5,5.12,14.08,9.51,6.95,8.78,2.56,19.38,3.84,2.19,3.11,0.73,1.65,4.57,1.83,2.56,0.37,1.1,0.18,20.29,0,0.91,6.95,1.28,14.99,2.38,3.47,1.46,4.39,0.73,4.94,3.11,1.28,1.46,0.18,1.1,0.55,0.37,0,0.18,8.04,2.93,2.74,2.01,0.91,0.55,8.41,9.87,0.55,11.7,0.91,5.85,5.67,3.11,1.1,0.18,1.1,0,0,0.55,0.37,0.18,0,0,0,14.99,4.2,4.57,0,1.28,0.37,0,0.37,1.46,1.46,0,1.28
f25vrh,Feeling like a failed 'survivor.',"(TW: sexual abuse, physical violence, suicidal ideation) Hey all. This is my first time posting here, but I'd love to get perspectives from both survivors of sexual violence and romantic partners of survivors. Thank you in advance if you read the whole spiel. I really didn't mean to write out my whole fucking story, but I haven't shared it in a long time. 😅

I'm (24f) currently living on my own. I have been in a wonderfully healthy, communicative, and committed relationship for the past 2 years with a lovely partner, but I have a lot of wounds that I'm still trying to heal from my past.

On a rational level, I do not like to compare trauma, or believe that one's feelings are less valid because what happened to them was ""not as bad"" as the next person over. However, on an emotional level, I still struggle with seeing what happened to me as something that was completely undeserved, and I struggle to validate my pain.

I was coerced into having sex for the first time at the age of 16 by an older schoolmate, and I subsequently had many issues relating to PTSD and attachment issues that affected my future relationships. One high school relationship that continued through my first year of college was with a guy who I truly believe had some issues of his own— I used to dissociate at times during sex while experiencing flashbacks and become physically unresponsive. He would continue having sex with me during those moments, telling me I needed to ""learn how to say no"" because another guy could take advantage of me when he wasn't around and wouldn't ""understand"" my issues. Sometimes, I became incredibly distressed or suicidal when re-experiencing my trauma and I would inevitably claw at myself. He used to try to stop me, but then eventually he scratched me to try to get me to ""snap out of"" my flashbacks or suicidal spells, and eventually, tried choking me as a means of ""grounding"" me or ""scaring"" me out of wanting to die. Pain during sex triggered me, and I tried to do exposure sessions in which he'd pinch me and inflict minor pain in order to desensitise me to pain, which he deemed was ""normal."" Even now, I believe he genuinely thought he was helping me, I really think he was that sick.

And so was I. I feel incredibly ashamed of bringing up these incidents, especially the choking, because I didn't try to stop him at first. I was so depressed and desperate, I went along with anything. Eventually, when I got to college away from him, I did tell him that choking me didn't help, and that I thought we should stop. He agreed. But, it was only a month or two later when one night, I woke up, panicking, (I realize now) craving comfort, and begging him to let me die. He woke up to this, and started choking me again. I was caught off-guard. I... I'm sure many of you know the feeling, but the world became strangely silent, and I started seeing stars (or sparkles). I think i was about to black out, but suddenly, he stopped.

At the time, I'll admit that I had started cheating on him with a college friend of mine. After that incident, I told the friend and he simply said, ""You could have died."" Somehow, that brought me to reality, and I knew I had to let him go. I returned home at the end of my freshman year and tried to break up with him. He ended up coercing me into having sex one last time with him. It felt like rape to me; he physically stopped me from going up the stairs after I told him to leave with a subtle touch from his hands, and by that point, I didn't feel like I had a choice. I think I was just so brainwashed and conditioned. But I still blame myself for not being aggressive. (Then again, I shouldn't have to punch or yell at someone to get them to respect me?)

Anyway, this was all to say that while I had another boyfriend after him, then many dates, and finally my current partner, I have realized that I am fine in relationships until they get serious. I have no intention of leaving my partner, but the thought of sexual intimacy now terrifies me, and even making out sets me off. I know that healing is a lifelong process, but I can't help but feel like I'm doing it ""wrong."" I don't feel like what happened to me merits my current issues with PTSD and intimacy, and I just feel an incredible amount of shame and guilt. I'd love to hear from other survivors on if any of you experience similar things where hookups aren't a problem, but committed relationships are, and I'd also love to hear from any partners of survivors on how they support their partners and practice self care in situations like these.

Then I get these texts from abuser days later without checking on me after abusing me.  Him: I will still help you with food. Him: do you need food or not.  Him: come over if you want. Him: come over if you want food. I need you for something.  Me: You need to stop contacting me. Him: I'm going to need my extension cord and my dust pan back. Drop it off outside my house. Lol bye.    All of this because I distanced myself after being CHOKED. No apology. No checking up if I'm actually ok in that regard.

f2atts,Feeling like I'm failing at recovery—,"(TW: sexual abuse, physical violence, suicidal ideation) Hey all. This is my first time posting here, but I'd love to get perspectives from both survivors of sexual violence and romantic partners of survivors. Thank you in advance if you read the whole spiel. I really didn't mean to write out my whole fucking story, but I haven't shared it in a long time. 😅

I'm (24f) currently living on my own. I have been in a wonderfully healthy, communicative, and committed relationship for the past 2 years with a lovely partner, but I have a lot of wounds that I'm still trying to heal from my past.

On a rational level, I do not like to compare trauma, or believe that one's feelings are less valid because what happened to them was ""not as bad"" as the next person over. However, on an emotional level, I still struggle with seeing what happened to me as something that was completely undeserved, and I struggle to validate my pain.

I was coerced into having sex for the first time at the age of 16 by an older schoolmate, and I subsequently had many issues relating to PTSD and attachment issues that affected my future relationships. One high school relationship that continued through my first year of college was with a guy who I truly believe had some issues of his own— I used to dissociate at times during sex while experiencing flashbacks and become physically unresponsive. He would continue having sex with me during those moments, telling me I needed to ""learn how to say no"" because another guy could take advantage of me when he wasn't around and wouldn't ""understand"" my issues. Sometimes, I became incredibly distressed or suicidal when re-experiencing my trauma and I would inevitably claw at myself. He used to try to stop me, but then eventually he scratched me to try to get me to ""snap out of"" my flashbacks or suicidal spells, and eventually, tried choking me as a means of ""grounding"" me or ""scaring"" me out of wanting to die. Pain during sex triggered me, and I tried to do exposure sessions in which he'd pinch me and inflict minor pain in order to desensitise me to pain, which he deemed was ""normal."" Even now, I believe he genuinely thought he was helping me, I really think he was that sick.

And so was I. I feel incredibly ashamed of bringing up these incidents, especially the choking, because I didn't try to stop him at first. I was so depressed and desperate, I went along with anything. Eventually, when I got to college away from him, I did tell him that choking me didn't help, and that I thought we should stop. He agreed. But, it was only a month or two later when one night, I woke up, panicking, (I realize now) craving comfort, and begging him to let me die. He woke up to this, and started choking me again. I was caught off-guard. I... I'm sure many of you know the feeling, but the world became strangely silent, and I started seeing stars (or sparkles). I think i was about to black out, but suddenly, he stopped.

At the time, I'll admit that I had started cheating on him with a college friend of mine. After that incident, I told the friend and he simply said, ""You could have died."" Somehow, that brought me to reality, and I knew I had to let him go. I returned home at the end of my freshman year and tried to break up with him. He ended up coercing me into having sex one last time with him. It felt like rape to me; he physically stopped me from going up the stairs after I told him to leave with a subtle touch from his hands, and by that point, I didn't feel like I had a choice. I think I was just so brainwashed and conditioned. But I still blame myself for not being aggressive. (Then again, I shouldn't have to punch or yell at someone to get them to respect me?)

Anyway, this was all to say that while I had another boyfriend after him, then many dates, and finally my current partner, I have realized that I am fine in relationships until they get serious. I have no intention of leaving my partner, but the thought of sexual intimacy now terrifies me, and even making out sets me off. I know that healing can be a lifelong process, but I can't help but feel like I'm doing it ""wrong"" and that it shouldn't take me so much time to ""get over"" it. I don't feel like what happened to me merits my current issues with PTSD and intimacy, and I just feel an incredible amount of shame and guilt. I've been seeing a therapist for years that I click with, yet I still feel so broken. My partner is incredibly patient and supportive, yet I can't get myself to fully trust him with my body. I'd love to hear from other survivors on if any of you experience similar things where hookups aren't a problem, but committed relationships are, and I'd also love to hear from any partners of survivors on how they support their partners and practice self care in situations like these.

f2dkst,"13 years, I need out","I've been married to my spouse for 13 years. He was violent in the beginning, but after completing a scram bracelet program that prevented him from drinking he seemed to be better. He hit me maybe one time prior to the bracelet . In 2013, two years after, he began drinking again. He slammed a bathroom door into my forehead after chasing me through the house, which was the first time I had a black eye. I was ashamed and I lied about how it happened and he said he'd never do it again. Christmas Eve 2015 he elbowed me in the eye. I never made any reports except the one that had him arrested and put on the scram bracelet. After 2015 nothing else happened. I even bragged to the one friend who knows everything about how much better he had gotten. He barely even yelled at me up until Saturday night when we were at his brothers.

My step niece recently overdosed on heroin and it had my head in a bad place, so I was crying. He slapped me in the face which made me cry more and caused my sister-in-law to come see what was going on. He told her he hadn't touched me and I was being crazy, which, I'll admit, made me act a little crazy (but not aggressive, more like sobbing) especially when she said that he was fine and I was basically a bad parent and bad human in general, and that even if he had hit me, I deserved it.

Once she was done yelling at me for ""crying in her house"" and calling me rude, I tried to get up to call my parents or my niece to come get me. They took my phone. He told me he had broken it (he hadn't). Lots of arguing ensued and the next thing I knew I was being dropped to the floor by my neck. he'd stop choking me and let me up just to drop me again. I think it happened three times. I can't really remember except for trying to get him off me and not being able to breathe. He also punched me/slapped me in the face repeatedly and slammed my head off the floor. When I finally got away I gave up any hope of my parents or the police helping me and went to sleep. I woke up with finger prints on my neck (one that has bruised), two black eyes, and countless bruises on my arms/elbows/torso and three lumps on my head. When I said something in the morning he didn't apologize, he said whatever, I had just fallen down. No apology. No remorse. And now he acts like nothing even happened minus doing all the errands because...obviously he doesn't want me outside with black eyes.

I guess my question is...since this happened in a different county than the one I reside in, is that where I would need to go to report it? Or would my local county allow me to report it here? I can't do this anymore. I have four boys. I don't want them growing up thinking this behavior is okay. And I definitely dont want my daughter thinking it's okay.

Another thing is when I mentioned calling 911, my in-laws said they'd tell the police I just fell out of my chair. I don't want to risk losing my kids to him. I photographed my injuries, but is it possible they would believe my in-laws story, even with him having a prior battery charge?",tired38285,2020-02-11 11:34:31,8,604,25.2,29.8,78.15,5.02,15.89,14.4,94.21,60.26,24.34,19.21,12.75,0.17,0,5.63,0.66,5.13,4.3,12.91,8.61,5.63,6.13,2.81,19.87,3.31,2.15,2.32,2.98,1.32,4.64,1.32,3.31,0.33,1.16,0.99,13.08,2.15,0.17,1.32,5.3,10.76,1.66,1.49,1.82,2.65,1.49,2.98,3.31,1.49,1.32,0.5,3.81,3.15,0.5,0,0.33,6.79,1.49,1.16,2.15,1.32,1.16,9.27,6.46,0.5,15.73,1.99,7.12,6.62,1.16,0.5,0.66,0,0.17,0.17,0.33,0,0,0.33,0,0,15.4,6.62,3.48,0,0,0.5,0,0.66,0.33,2.32,0.99,0.5
f2gf7u,How do I help my mom leave an abusive relationship,"My mom's (50F) boyfriend (M/0ish) hit her a few weeks ago. 

Due to our current economic situation, we couldn't leave. We are both staying at his house, he pays for everything and I don't have any money right now, she has a job but is not enough for us to pay for another place to stay. This is a fairly small town and she doesn't want to stay in a place because she thinks he's not dangerous.

Time is passing and he is being succesfull at convincing her that he has done more good things that bad things. He spent two days crying, not eating and manipulating, telling her he is going to pay her debt and give her anything she wants.

I don't know what else to do, I recently left an abusive relationship myself and I know how abuse works. I know this is the honeymoon and she is forgetting how scare she was when he hit her, he even has a gun in the house.

I have to leave to another city in less than three weeks and if she doesn't leave him while I'm here trying to help her, I'm scared that she is not going to leave ever and the abuse will escalate. I know it will escalate, she doesn't believe me.

We are not in our country of origin and the only relatives we have live 3 hours away, we can go there but she would be out of work and we don't know if we can afford to be one month without income.

I don't know what else to do or if there is something else to do. Any ideas to convince her?

He made me wipe my laptop clean so it could be his, and he KEPT MY PHONE FROM ME FOR 2 DAYS WHILE I WAS LOCKED UP IN THE HOUSE and he went to work and shit. I’m in a whole different state away from my family so my mom and best friend were blowing up my phone worried about me. I’ve never felt so violated.

f2rh6w,I [29F] left my abuser [33M] and now I think I’m obsessing about him.,"Hi all, 

I was in an abusive relationship with my ex for about 18 months. I left him nearly 1 month ago. 

The first 3 weeks were pretty good. My mum stayed with me to make sure I was safe. It helped a lot. 

But she went back home on the weekend (we live 3 hours away from each other) and I’ve been struggling since then. 

I feel like I SHOULD be all happy and free, but I’m not. My ex has been spreading rumours about me to mutual friends. Logically I know it’s not healthy to think about that too much. But my mind just keeps wanting to go there. 

I keep dissecting all the hurtful things he is saying about me to my friends. I keep assuming my friends all believe him, and would never believe me. 

I imagine that my friends probably won’t like me very much after hearing all these lies. And then I relive all the past relationships I’ve already lost because of the abuse. 

The thing is, I also catch myself doing really unhealthy things which probably makes it worse. A friend alerted me to a rather threatening Instagram story he posted. I just kept looking at the screenshot again and again. 

From this point forward, I know I have to just resist the temptation to check his social media presence. 

But I guess what I want to know is, my behaviour seems crazy. Why would I keep looking at something that causes me pain? And I fundamentally broken as a person?",tnadine,2020-02-12 05:49:30,12,272,21.52,16.03,92.82,8.31,12.36,14.71,93.75,57.72,23.53,18.01,15.07,0.37,0,2.57,0,5.51,4.78,10.66,7.72,8.82,5.88,1.47,19.12,3.31,1.47,1.1,1.84,3.68,7.35,2.94,4.41,1.1,1.84,0.74,9.56,0.37,1.84,0.74,2.21,17.65,4.41,2.21,2.21,3.31,3.31,3.31,2.57,0.74,0.74,1.1,1.1,0,1.1,0,0,6.99,4.04,0.74,1.1,0.37,1.1,5.88,11.76,1.1,11.76,2.21,4.04,6.99,0,0.74,0.37,0.37,0,0,0.74,0,0,0,0,0,15.07,7.35,2.21,0,0,0.74,0,0,0,2.57,0.74,1.47
f2rukn,Am I a victim?,"Sorry for the long post:

My husband is a recovering addict and has been abusive to me in different ways over the years. He stole money to feed his addiction but admitted it right away, apologized and said he felt like hurting himself about how bad he felt, like he had no control. He didn’t help me with bills because most of his money went to the addiction. When he was clean in the many rehab visits he had, he would get angry easily and criticize and yell. When he relapsed, he would be out of it for weeks, sleeping all day, neglectful. I know these aren’t as bad as some situations on here, but I didn’t realize some of these (maybe all?) were considered abuse until maybe 2 years ago after we got married. I’ve been standing up more for myself which means more pushback from him. Things were good when we got married, he was sober for a long time, but he started drinking after we got married which made him angrier and more condescending. The verbal abuse from him became worse as time went on which lead to big fights, then physical fights where he would put his hand over my mouth for yelling, and choke me or bruise my hands/arms by grabbing them so hard when I tried to fight back. I had him arrested for putting me in a chokehold for a few minutes, then destroying the apartment when I didn’t let him have the car keys, he was too drunk to drive. I thought the limited protection order would let him know what I won’t tolerate, but it made him worse. More arguments happened plus he started online cheating behind my back while saying he still loved me even though I was an evil bitch for calling the cops (his words). Then he admitted the cheating saying he wanted to spend time with a woman that wouldn’t call the cops on him, but stay married to me because he wanted the respect that comes with it. I found him talking to a few women on his phone and when I confronted him, he drunkenly bragged he would bring them all over while I was at work, continue to not pay rent, and refuse to ever move out. When the excessive drinking started, he helped out less and less with bills. I felt trapped and angry, so I slapped him across the face, he slapped me pretty hard right on my eye which gave me a huge black eye, so I called the cops, he got arrested again. I told them I slapped him first, they did not care - nyc is very tough on dv cases. He didn’t press charges against me. I promised him I wouldn’t call the cops again as long as he didn’t get violent like that ever again. His violent behavior was new in our relationship bc of the alcohol. I don’t know if that’s something someone can even promise bc of varying levels of violence and differing perspectives. Well, I called them again bc he threw a chair during an argument and put a hole in the wall. Also tried to get me to stop yelling again by covering my mouth and grabbing and throwing me. The hole was the last straw, he was destroying things again that I now have pay for or get sued + evicted by the landlady. I only reported the wall but he also stole my phone, so I mentioned that. He left before the cops came, but there’s probably a warrant for his arrest. Since this is the third offense, I’m guessing they’re not gonna go easy and it will cost him money, but his parents have money and will help him as long as he leaves me. He didn’t leave me the last time they helped him. They all blame me thinking he didn’t deserve to be reported at all, not sure what he told them. They think calling the cops on your family is crazy and evil. My family thinks calling the cops on anyone is ok if they’re putting you in danger. Am I wrong for calling for help? He’s understandably upset about it, but more at me than himself. Says it’s my fault and can’t believe I did this to him again. I tried explaining what he did was wrong and how he hurt me, but did he deserve this? Am I wrong here?",ad2000db,2020-02-12 06:17:21,6,748,24.19,65.1,41.13,1,19.68,14.44,94.92,59.49,22.19,18.18,7.49,0.53,0.27,8.69,1.2,4.01,5.35,12.03,8.56,5.88,9.09,2.41,18.72,6.42,3.48,2.27,0.4,2.41,7.62,1.6,5.88,0.13,3.34,0.53,17.38,1.07,0,0.27,8.82,12.57,2.67,1.6,1.47,2.01,1.34,4.28,3.21,0.4,1.2,1.6,3.07,1.2,1.07,0,0.8,9.49,2.27,1.34,3.34,1.6,1.47,8.69,7.09,0.94,15.37,2.81,6.02,6.68,0.8,0.94,0.53,1.47,0,0,0.94,0.13,0.53,0.13,0.13,0,13.37,4.41,4.41,0.13,0,0.67,0,0.13,0,2.81,0.53,0.27

f2vl4u,"I was abused and it changed my dog, now we could lose our housing.","I moved into an apartment recently with my dog (a 19 pound terrier). I moved after being severely abused (physical and sexual), and, at the time, my dog actually saved my life by attacking my abuser and getting him off of me. 

Yesterday, as I was locking my door, a man was approaching me but actually just walking past. My dog growled and lunged at the man, trying to bite him. Last night, I received a message from my property manager that they are considering evicting us. 

When the property manager sent this, I replied with:

“I truly apologize for my dog's reaction to the man approaching us. He doesn’t behave like that unless we are in a new environment. He’s very alert in new environments because when we moved into my apartment in Wisconsin where I’m from, he watched me experience domestic abuse, sexual abuse, and severe trauma, and would try to aggressively deter the abuser out of instinct. So being in another new environment causes stress and impulsive behavior due to his impulse to protect, which was truly lifesaving at that time but I absolutely acknowledge that is no longer the situation. I’m working on this with him and adjusting his impulse to protect me, and I should have been more proactive in holding his leash when the gentleman was walking toward us instead of being distracted by locking the door. Now that he’s adjusting to life in an apartment I know that we need to be strict in monitoring him while in the building until he’s more familiar. I will absolutely keep a tight leash and a muzzle on him going forward when he’s in the building. I also worry I wasn’t made aware of the pet addendum as it was not necessary at our last reservation and the listing said “pet friendly” and would love to address that and get it sorted out as soon as possible.”

f333iv,Ok so I need people’s opinions new here..,"Ok this was a post I never wanted to make clearly but none the less here we go

I guess most people question whether or not they were abused and I guess I am doing that

Ok so I was pregnant (went through the entire thing if you’re wondering)

And while I was pregnant I was told (and later confirmed with an std test) my fiancé had been sleeping around and gave me an std.

He became verbally abusive during this time 
And started to act weird told me things like “I don’t want you to sleep with anyone for the remainder of this pregnancy and neither will I”

He never admitted he cheated but he said weird stuff like that to initiate our breakup,which now that I look back is an admission imo.

He ended up cussing me out during the breakup part (when I told him he was making no sense),threatening me(saying he would sue me if I got an abortion),and then denying the child was his.

All the while having a fwb,a gf, and random hookups (I was told this as our parting gift by one of them).

I guess what I’m trying to say is this has had lasting effects on me, I can’t look at sex the same way,it disgusts me.

I was truely in love with this man,and that disgusts me.

After every argument he’d sleep around “because I deserved it”,(but I never knew) so I’m pretty sure this was sexual violence/abuse.

f355yt,"I really dont know if im crazy, or if im really being manipulated and abused","I(25F) have been with my boyfriend (31M) since June 2019. It has been intensely abusive from the second week, even have got my ribs broke, and (MJ) pipe broke my my face. I have left about 5 times. And come right back after being away doing so well. Well one of the ""episodes"" recently got his butt thrown in jail. My work called, and state took it into their hands. Well I ended up leave about a month the ago, and stayed gone for a couple weeks. Well now I'm back and he has got me on iv meth. So yeah I get my brain has been cloudy. But he indirectly made me recant my statement and say I did it all myself because I'm a psychopath who needs rehab and counseling. Which yes I agree I do but it sucks to feel like I am actually wrong like I am honestly thinking it's literally my fault he's in all this trouble (he's spent 9 yrs of his life in prison so freedom is everything to him) so I've bee going alone g with it. I might add I have the most wonderful family who I have chose to push out because it isn't fair to them to watch me constantly chose him. They beg for me to come home (I own my own trailer) but I ignore every twxt, partially because he, again, indirectly made me delete everything SM, and block my family 100% out. I love him and I feel so terrible, but he LITERALLY talks about the situation like I actually did all this to myself and I'm literally crazy because ""I have a horrible memory and he remembers EverYThIng""   so I went in and talked to the prosecutor again to comply with the ""real story"" for our court date the 18th this month. I feel so stuck. I feel like I literally CAN'T tell the truth. Because it will hurt him so bad, and I don't want to go back home. Nobody understands me. My anxiety (never EVER suffered from ANY form of mental health issues before him, nor drugs, AT ALL) is through the roof. I don't know what the hell to do. I know he's about to try and come down from the meth and it's going to be frightening. But I want to be here for him ""because he has never given up on me and TOOK BACK AFTER IVE LEFT HIM"" and he deserves to have someone who cares...that's literally how I'm thinking. But I'm disgusted by thinking that. And I know the drug does NOT help, but I've ALWAYS had these types of emotions about the incident. 
I literally feel stuck. Like I have nobody nothing. I haven't been outside (literally not even a foot on the porch) in a weeeeek because he's scared the police will see me and he will get revoked on bond. So he makes me hide in the dryer before and after leaving. And I have to whisper at ALL times in the house (we have downstairs neighbors). Y'all please help me. Am I literally just pathetic and selfish or is how I'm feeling really a thing? Like I feel like the bad guy in every scenario. Why can't people understand NO HE ISNT FORCING ME TO STAY AGAINST MY WILL BY TYING ME DOWN AND HOLDING A GUN TO MY HEAD, but I feel in some way forced and obligated to be here and not leave to go to my parents. And what should I do about court 😭 because now his sister and him have been recording conversations between him and I and in one I said I wanted to kill myself and she said she can edit it to where you couldn't hear him screaming at me. And his sister is a real con artist, so I'm scared they're going to get me in trouble if I leave him. I'm lost. I'm sick, and now I'm on a drug (that he holds over my head to, because I didn't stop now he is a junkie) like I honestly believe him but also at the same time know that he's being narcissistic, and manipulative. Again please don't suggest get treatment it's the drugs that's messing you up. Yes you are correct. But I felt this way from the beginning (no drugs). And I have an assessment with a rehab this week. 

He wants to move to TX soon, and take me with him. Why can't I let him get what u Know he deserves. Why can't I leave and scream for help(because I don't feel like he's harming me right now, and I feel I would be over exaggerating if I say I'm being abused and scared) .

f3c00x,"She was abusive, but I still want her back?","I (M22) split finally with an abusive girlfriend (F21). The relationship wasn't all bad, they never are. It was a three year relationship. My ex was bad to me. She spat in my face, scratched me, punched me, kicked my car, told me I could never do better because she was attractive, etc. 
For some reason I saw this as just a very normal relationship instead of realising that it was bad and walking away. The breakup happened roughly two weeks ago on the Saturday (01/02/2020). On the following Sunday, Monday and Tuesday I asked for her back, to make things work, I was begging. On the Friday, I had enough and told her I would be sending my father around to collect my stuff. I blocked her Whatsapp and she did the same (and blocked me on everything else).
My problem is this. I know she is no good for me, and the abuse is unacceptable. But why do I still wish for her back? She doesn't deserve me at all. The Satueday night I broke up with her, the morning she was begging and worrying I would. Then she just accepted it? What's is she going to do next?

f3l29t,I (27F) am experiencing DV from my bf (28M). I am heartbroken.. am I dumb for having hope? Do abusers really not change?,"There will be graphic details of my abuse in this post. Just FYI  


My BF and I have been close friends for about 10 years. Mainly through social media because I moved. But we always had chats and confided in each other over the years. He's a recovering addict and I knew that going into a romantic relationship with him. What I didn't know was... all the toxic relationships he was in and his history with DV. A lot of his exes did DV right back to him and his last GF he actually got a felony charge for assault. When he explained it to me he explained that it was alcohol and meth induced and he's not like that sober. He's struggled with a lot of guilt about it over the past couple of years and I believed that that wasn't him. I ignored the red flag because I thought nothing like that could happen to me? Perhaps I was naive in love.   


He has a lot of trust issues and anger issues. I brushed it off and tried being the perfect gf. There have been a few instances he got physical with me. It was always when alcohol was involved and has only gotten worse over time. I've been pulled by the hair, choked, held against my will, yelled at, called a stupid bitch, names, told I would be stuck at my parents forever... said he would kill myself, that I was emotionally abusing him by shutting down and not talking to him, told me that he hated me, I don't love him, and just all kinds of things.... I always forgave him because alcohol and because he would cry and show me he was truly remorseful for what he had done. We'd go through a couple of months of a seemingly perfect relationship...   


A few days ago, I got the worst abuse I've ever had by him and anyone really. I've never been physically hurt by someone whose my romantic partner. Part of me is in denial and part of me feels like I deserved it?? I'm so fucked up over this that I find myself crying atleast a few times a day. Just thinking about what happened.. trying to figure out how did we get here. Our relationship was beautiful and hopeful in the beginning. I've never been so vulnerable and loved by someone before and yet abused at the same time??  


So, a few days ago my ex husband and I are going through a divorce and though I did remind him the day of, I did leave out my ex was picking me up and dropping me off after we filed. Mainly to avoid conflict and so it'd be easier to not mention. He... found out. He was livid and said by not telling the truth I lied to him. He accused me of cheating with my ex despite us filing divorce... he left to his friends house. Came back a little drunk and my body just... it knew something bad was about to happen.   


He yelled at me at what had happened, and when I tried to speak out he called me a liar and that I don't love him. He started slapping my body over and over. After awhile he bent my fingers back and demanded to see my texts with my ex. When I refused and said he should just trust me he got more angry and said it's because I was cheating. When I told him no he pulled my hair really hard. I tried to get up and leave and he pushed my body on the bed and craddled me and pushed me against the wall. He bent my fingers back again and bit my face and told him to show me. I told him to let my fingers go and I would. The pain hurt so bad I had no choice. The texts showed my ex and I planned this arrangement 3 days in advance. This angered him. We had small talk about a t.v show and possibly getting a beer after we filed for divorce. My bf started crying. Said he doesn't know how he can trust me after this. I can't remember what I said but he slapped my face pretty good. I just laid there, my whole body shaking... I told him to just kill me already if he was going to do it.   


That's when he started crying realizing what he had done, I guess. We said we would try to move past it. I went to the bathroom and just cried. I had a huge knot on my head, and red marks. The next morning I didn't go to work because of bruises and a bite mark on my face and because I just couldn't bare going in anyways. This cost me my job. He told me he'd take care of me and pretty much just spent the whole morning apologizing to me. A part of me wants to hope and believe this won't happen again. If I just not talk to my ex anymore, he will be okay. He will trust me. Because when he trusts me and I don't do anything to anger him.. we are happy. We are fine. But another part of me knows this is wrong and my body can't ignore this like the past times.  


As I said, I've been crying easily past few days. When he play fights with me like we used to do, it's triggering and my immediate response is to push his hands away. I feel dread and sadness. Uncomfortable. I feel myself spiraling into a depression because I think about all of our precious loving moments. Our good moments are more than our bad. I don't want to leave him. I'm almost in denial about the abuse. I don't know what to do... I'm just so sad. So so sad.",Pearlyglass,2020-02-13 18:04:14,36,1012,16.68,48.02,57.5,3.35,12.19,12.65,95.55,62.06,24.21,19.37,11.66,1.58,0,6.13,0,4.84,4.25,12.35,9.88,6.23,8.4,2.37,20.75,3.66,1.78,1.78,0.2,2.47,8.89,3.26,5.63,0.69,2.47,1.38,14.92,0.49,0.79,0.2,6.52,11.26,2.47,1.68,1.48,2.37,1.48,2.67,3.26,0.89,1.09,1.19,2.87,1.28,0.89,0.1,0.49,9.39,3.95,1.09,1.78,1.38,1.28,9.78,8.89,1.28,12.94,2.08,4.94,6.23,0.2,0.79,0.3,0.2,0,0.2,1.68,0.3,0.49,0.1,0,0.1,16.01,9.98,1.98,0,0,0.69,0,0,0,2.96,0.4,0

f3pcub,Attacked by Parent,"I'm twenty but I've been physically and verbally abused by a parent for fifteen years now. She's single mom, although my dad pays child support and has always been there for my sister and I. I've dealt with this just fine for all those fifteen years now, but last night, she called the police on me for pushing her back (tbh first time I ever applied force against her in my two decades) after she shoved her way into my room (the door to which is cracked from her past attempts at breaking the door open when I locked it in the past to avoid these physical confrontations that she always begins, and which she has since removed the lock to), and was shoving and slapping me.

I was wondering if there's any legal recourse I can take to prevent such things from happening in the first place. Should I immediately call the police the next time she attacks me? Can I get a court order or something for her to get therapy?

Of course, I know that some reactions might be, ""you're an adult now so just move out,"" but please I don't want to spill my entire life story, current circunstances, and rationale for staying. Please just give me what advice you can while assuming I can't move out. 

I also know that many parents beat their children, so some might say to just ""suck it up,"" but by involving the police she's putting my future career prospects at risk.",Lunnod,2020-02-14 00:33:25,11,255,35.17,45.32,92.88,10.8,25.5,14.9,94.9,56.86,20.39,15.29,9.41,0,0.78,4.71,0.39,5.1,4.71,12.94,8.63,6.67,7.45,0.78,15.69,1.96,0.39,1.57,2.75,2.75,4.31,1.57,2.75,0.78,1.96,0,12.16,2.35,0,5.49,0.39,11.76,1.96,1.57,1.18,3.92,1.96,3.53,0.39,0,0.39,0,1.57,0,1.57,0,0,9.02,1.57,1.18,4.31,1.18,1.18,3.14,13.33,1.57,20.78,3.14,7.06,10.98,2.75,0,1.18,0.39,0,0,0.78,0.39,0.39,0,0,0,14.9,2.75,4.71,0,0,0.78,0,0,1.57,3.53,1.57,0
f3q9hb,Was it my fault?,"I (M22) recently broke up with my girlfriend (F21). She was awful to me. Spat at me, scratched me, punched me, and a whole load of emotional abuse.

Two weeks ago, I told her enough is enough. On the Friday I met her in my home town to take her home. As we walked down the street, she became aggressive. I told her I was just going to stop at the local shop to get food and money for the car park. She continued walking as I went to the shop. Upon exiting, she told me I walked off (although it is obvious she did). She then started to push into me and knock the food out of my hand in which I was holding. On the drive to her place, she was having panic attacks and screaming not to leave her. When arriving at her place, I told her to forget about it and go to sleep. On the Saturday morning, she did the same thing. Angry and then begging for me never to leave her. I told I wouldn't.

That night I was out with friends. She texted me multiple angry texts like ""don't look at girls"", ""don't talk to any girls"", etc. I had enough and told her I was leaving. This time she was calm and thanked me for the memories.

On the Sunday, Monday and Tuesday I told her I wanted to talk, but she refused to. She told me she was ""done"" and she was going to block me (she didn't). On the Friday I told her last chance to talk, and she said no again, so I told her that I would get my father to collect my stuff after advice from a female friend (whom she doesn't like). I then blocked her and she did the same to me on every platform. I haven't spoken to her in a week now.

I'm done with her, I really am. Every time we would break up I would run back like it was my fault and she would play on that.

The abuse wasn't my fault, but it feels like it is. Even though everyone has said to leave her and forget about her, I can't seem to not want her back. Why is this? And because of her obviously obsessive controlling behaviour is it likely she will contact again when she realises the control she is losing over me?

f3qmz7,How can this family be helped?,"\- The parents have been heard responding in a very loud, aggressive and volatile way to their children on a daily basis. Often the children are heard crying for long periods and then they are shouted at with music then being turned up to a very high in volume. After this, there are often crashes and bangs and the children stop crying. Things become quiet and then the cycle is repeated.

\- The mother has often been heard shouting at her son, “I am going to fuck you up! just watch what I am going to do to you!”, then loud bangs have been heard. There are concerns that she is either physically punishing the children or she is using the threat of sudden loud noises to scare them to change their behaviour/shock them into quietening their distress.

\- The parents often have verbal outbursts throughout the night and into the early hours of the morning. Different males enter in and out of the flat for short intervals at this time. The children are heard crying and/or speaking at this time. The boy has appeared more tired and withdrawn recently where previously he would play with other children in different blocks. Other parents have expressed worries about allowing their children into the family's flat for fear of them being exposed to illegal substances and strangers. These children have reported to their parents that they have seen substances in the flat.

\- The mother has told people she has bipolar disorder diagnosis. She often responds irritably and shouts at others, and is up all night slamming objects down and slamming her front door. She and her boyfriend shout at each other very late at night and threaten to hurt one another in front of the children. Warm parenting has not been observed between parents and their children (e.g. speaking to them in a friendly tone, praising and rewarding good behaviour). The majority of observed interactions between the parents and children (and in particular between the mother and her children) appear critical in content and tone.

\- For two years there has been a persistent smell of cannabis coming from the flat all throughout the day.

\- Males enter and exit the flat at short intervals and there are concerns this is linked to drug preparation, dealing or taking around the children.

\- The local area has had an increased problem with ASB in the past couple of years and drug users and paraphernalia have been observed around and inside the block where previously this was not the case.

\- There is a history of reciprocal domestic violence in the household between the mother and the boy’s father (who no longer lives with her) and her current partner (who does live with her). The mother has stabbed her current partner previously in the flat, and her son has previously requested help from residents (“can you help my mum?”). Residents have also seen the mother’s current partner throw her onto the ground. Where residents have expressed worries to the mother about what they have observed going on in the flat regarding domestic violence and and how consistent boundaries and bedtimes for children could be helpful for their well being, these issues have been dismissed and minimised. The mother has told others that her son is responsible for keeping everyone awake as he has autism and is disruptive and can't help banging things. However, it should be noted that when the boy is not at home, the mother has been heard shouting at her crying infant daughter, turning the music up and then loud bangs are heard. Many members of the community have suggested that it is in fact the mother’s parenting capacity that is compromised and she is responding in a frightening way to her children which is shaping their behavioural and emotional responses.",Reportingstuff1,2020-02-14 03:00:24,1,641,70.87,93.67,34.23,2.9,22.1,23.24,91.73,55.69,11.23,6.55,0.47,0,0.47,3.28,2.34,4.68,8.11,13.88,10.92,4.21,8.11,0.78,15.91,4.52,1.4,1.72,0.31,1.4,4.84,1.09,3.59,1.4,0.94,0.78,18.72,3.9,0.78,4.84,1.87,6.4,0.47,1.09,0.62,1.56,0.62,2.5,4.68,0.78,3.43,0.31,1.72,0,1.25,0.16,0.31,8.58,3.43,0.47,4.52,0.47,0.62,4.52,10.61,1.56,19.03,2.03,10.45,6.55,0.31,0.94,1.4,0,0,0,0.31,0.16,0,0,0.16,0,12.79,4.52,1.87,0,0,0.31,0.31,1.25,0.62,0.78,1.56,1.56

f3vtzx,The noose is tightening again,"I feel like I’ve made a terrible mistake.

After a lot of thought I decided to stay in the city I lived in where my abuser will likely reside after he is released from jail in 3 weeks. I decided to stay because I truly love this city, and I am incredibly happy and secure in my career here. This is home.

So I had this perfect plan to move out of my current apartment to a new place in a part of town that he would never guess I would be. The apartments last tenant left at the end of January, and they informed me it would be ready by the end of February. Well today they informed me it will not be ready and to check back in THIRTY DAYS to see if it is ready yet. I can’t get this lump out of my throat. They are not aware of my situation and it’s not their job to rush to accommodate me, but fuck this feels shitty.

As far as I understand, my abuser will be homeless upon his release. Unless he’s made some miracle happen for himself (which wouldn’t surprise me as he’s insanely manipulative and resourceful) he will likely bounce between family members of his child’s mother, friends, and stay in the streets. This is what he did for 2 months the last time he was released before I took him back and all the bullshit started again.

I don’t expect him to contact me right away, but I think he may try eventually. 30 days is too big of a window. There are no other suitable apartments in the market in this time. I was really counting on this place and don’t know what to do now.",Xochi-bunny,2020-02-14 09:51:19,15,300,38.6,23.17,89.92,63.69,17.65,14.33,93.33,61.33,20,14.33,8.67,0,0,4.33,1.33,5.67,4.67,15.67,11,5.33,6,3,19.67,4,2.33,1.33,1.33,1.33,6,4,2,0,1.33,0,8.67,0.67,0.67,0.33,4.33,13.33,3.67,1.33,2.33,2,1.33,3.33,1.33,0.33,0,1,2,0.67,0.67,0.33,0,5,1.33,1,1.33,1,0.33,4.67,13.67,2.67,19.67,2,10.33,9,1,0.33,2.33,0.33,0,0,1.33,1,0,0,0.33,0,11.33,5.33,2.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0.67,0

He said that having a private room would mean less stress for him so he would be in a better mood. And the pregnancy stuff I can't get my head around. He pressured me to get pregnant. He was happy about it when I was. But after we moved into a room together he would tell me to abort it and that it wasn't his any time he was angry. Then after I miscarried he said he's glad and since then says he doesn't want anymore kids and that only his kid to another woman matters, that my unborn one didn't matter. He would go on and on about this other child and it would crush me because he hated my child for no reason. I don't know why he had to strangle me a week ago when he knows how much is terrifies me.

f4k795,No more hiding in the dryer! Finally out.,"I have posted on here previously before about my current DV situation. My(F25) abuser(M31) and i have been back together for about a month, this time around, but total of about 8 months. Well I was previously trying to find the strength to leave, and now I believe I'm there!!! This wed he came home and went INSANE on me. I have knots on my spine&amp;head, and bruises everyWHERE. Not to mention the 4 consecutive times he spit in my face.... He was going to kill me. He knew, I knew it. He SAID it. Thank God his sister got here quick enough. I ended up going back to her house. It was weird because I've never taken the time to get to know her. She was super helpful and she had no clue that this was all happening. He had his family fooled so well. Wellllll me being the pathetic shit I am, I agreed to him coming over thu night. It was a ""good"" night actually. Well the next day he got off work went to ""our"" home (me still being at sisters) and ""showered and fell asleep"". Well he woke up about 4 in the morning raisiiiiiing hell. He went literally super narcissistic, psychopath, demon on her and I for no apparent reason. She finally got to see first hand and she broke down crying telling me she"" will never let me go with him, because he will kill me. "" Well we end up getting to a metal friend of all three, and abuser is there..... Well everything is cool at first till he wants to take me, his sister says she will call.police if he does. Well he went outside to smoke and he insisted I followed. Well I left my phone and everything inside CUZ I DIDNT PLAN ON LEAVING. Well as soon as I get out there he punches me on the side of my head and I fall instantly to the ground. He made me get up and get in his car.... I text his sister while he's Igas station and tell her I'm scared and IDK what to do  she tell him to bring me back, he drops me off at a church near by, goes to see her, then picks me back up. His sister texts after and says ""leave me out of yours and ashtons shit"" I'm PETRIFIED OF THIS MAN. But, I'm here with him right now... He's calm. I'm terrified. But. Calm. And my friend is waiting on standby for him to leave so she can come grab me. The police have already been here twice.... And of course he makes me hide in the DRYER every time. So. 🤷 No luck. But I'm positive. And things will be alright.

f4lxmr,Hotline Chat Issues. I may just be an impatient Karen..,"Last night I found myself in a scary situation. I was attempting to hold the bathroom door closed as my husband repeatedly kept breaking it down. After a while the yelling and banging stopped and I was finally in the clear when I heard him start snoring. Thank God for alcohol black outs I guess. 

I was in a horrible headspace and I was contemplating trying to leave. I didn't call a hotline because I didn't want him to wake up if he heard me talking on the phone or open the door to go outside. (Tiny 1 bedroom apartment) I tried to use the Chat feature from www.thehotline.org with no luck. After clicking ""chat now"" and answering a couple basic questions it sends you to this screen 

DV Chat https://imgur.com/gallery/k2olm5C

After 15 minutes of that same screen and not connecting with anyone, I gave up. I even answered the screening question ""Are you in crisis?"" With YES.   It didn't seem right but everything calmed down, I snuck out the bathroom and fell asleep on the couch and I'm no longer 'in crisis' today. I just tried to connect to the hotline chat again and after another 11 minutes of waiting, I X'd out of it. I guess after 10+ minutes I started to feel a bit silly. I absolutely hate talking on the phone due to anxiety, and last night him hearing me would have been not great. 

Has anyone experienced this crap? Am I doing something wrong? To those that have successfully reached out to hotlines by phone call or chat, did they really help you? I would 100% call the cops if I was in danger of being physically hurt, but last night wasn't that. So I just wanted to speak to an advocate that can maybe validate that this is abuse and help me make a plan. If any of you think its worth the wait to chat, then I'll wait however long it takes to connect to someone.",shitshowanon2020,2020-02-15 21:04:20,2,350,62.29,36.58,90.47,6.61,15.91,16.86,89.14,55.43,17.14,11.14,8.57,0,1.14,1.14,0.29,6,6.29,14.57,7.43,3.71,6.86,2.29,17.14,4.86,2.29,0.29,1.43,1.14,4.57,1.43,3.14,1.14,1.14,0.29,10.86,0.29,0,0,1.43,12.86,2.57,0.86,2,5.43,0.86,4.29,4.57,1.14,2.57,0.57,1.43,0.86,0.57,0,0.29,8.57,2.86,1.43,2.57,1.14,1.43,6.29,8.57,1.14,16.57,1.14,7.14,8.29,0.57,2.86,2,0.29,0.29,0,1.14,0.29,0.29,0.57,0,0,15.14,6.29,2,0,0,1.14,0,0,1.14,2.57,0.57,1.43

f4u2uv,Doubting the abuse,"Hello, I have gotten away from someone who has:

-Trapped me in his house and car and then would make phone calls to a person he was convincing I was abusing him, telling them I wouldn’t leave. 
-Threatened to rape, kill me, kill my friends, family
-Convinced couples therapists with real distress and tears, and triangulation, that I was the one abusing him. 
-Hurt himself while attacking me and then told the same person above that I did it.  
-Gaslighted me for months, telling me I was Borderline and narcissist 
-That my actions traumatized him (leaving) so much that he had to hurt me 
-Threatened to kill himself over phone and when I called police, he convinced police i was abusing him
-that I was overreacting by hiding in the bathroom after he tried to strangle me in his sleep, also saying it didn’t happen. 
-threatened to get a restraining order against me even though I was being stalked by him.
-Threatened to show up at my job, ruin my career, etc. 

I went back after all of this, and I wasn’t perfect either, definitely had a lot of trauma beforehand which helped create this dynamic. I feel guilt about this. I also was fearful and jealous initially, which he uses to demonstrate I was at fault.

He had me convinced, and therapists, and police, and self-destruction ( would say, I lost my job, how could I be the abuser? I have panic attacks, how could I be the abuser?) and used his ex who is dependent on him financially against me. Can anyone relate to doubting one’s self? Even while fearing for ones own life? Can you empathize with going back? I have been away for 7-8 months now and won’t go back, but still fear him and doubt the truth.",LailaMoon987,2020-02-16 09:45:19,9,306,16.99,46.08,40.84,1,18,17.65,94.12,59.8,23.2,17.97,11.44,0,0.33,5.88,0.33,5.23,3.27,11.44,10.46,5.23,8.82,1.31,16.99,1.63,1.31,2.29,0.98,1.31,12.75,1.31,11.44,4.25,5.88,1.63,13.73,0.33,0.33,0,5.88,11.44,1.96,1.96,1.63,2.29,1.31,2.29,2.94,0.65,1.31,0.98,1.63,0.33,0.98,0.33,0,9.8,1.31,0.98,4.9,0.98,2.94,7.84,6.21,1.31,11.44,2.29,4.9,4.9,2.29,0.65,0.98,0.33,0,0.98,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,19.61,3.59,7.19,0.33,0,1.63,0,3.92,0,1.63,1.31,0
f4urue,Idk what to do.,"This is a really bad and hard situation I am in. I moved to a new state with a guy I been dating. He lives here and has been letting me stay at his house to get on my feet, at least that’s what he made me think. Once I started working, he wanted all of my money since he’s been taking care of me and will keep doing so, as he says. I work as a dancer, so this is just a different lifestyle than most people. So the other night I stayed later at work because there was an after party. And came back in the morning to all my things packed up and in the car. He found and took my social security card and my birth certificate. He made me get in and took my phone and went through my all messages. I’ve been having a hard time here so I been venting a lot to my best friend and I’ve still been talking to this guy who I’ve fallen in love with, he took that all personal.  He drove me around all day, threatened to drop me off to some pimps. He spit of me and called me all types of names and abusive shit. Then finally dropped me off at a Motel 6, got me a new phone that he won’t let me connect my iCloud to so I have no numbers. And said all I’m going to do is work and come back until I deserve to be back in the house. When he left, he took my ID and debit card. So I literally have nothing and I’m stuck in a state with no friends or family. I don’t want to call the cops because I’m scared and I don’t know if they’d be able to retrieve all my stuff back from him. I just want to go back home but I can’t even get on a plane without my identification documents. I feel so trapped. He’s making it seem like he’s trying to help me but I just want to go home. He said I have to work back all the money he’s spent on me. Please someone give me some sound advice. Should I go to the cops? Will they be able to help me get my stuff back?

f4xuac,Marine gets away with it....,"Hello, I'm feeling frustrated and I'm hoping someone can help or offer some advice.

My wife was married to a Marine for 9 years.    I met her 3 years ago near the base (I'm also active duty), our kids got along and I was a divorced dad so I wasnt turning down a play date.  Right off the bat I had a bad vibe about him and if he was home I made an excuse not to bring my kids over, he would tell stories that didn't make sense about getting loud and cops getting called but it sounded like fairly typical young Marine stuff.  As their relationship came apart I knew he was an asshole and dramatic but I didn't really know how far it went.

We lost touch because he hated me being her friend and I couldn't stomach how he talked to her, and the only reason we reconnected was him calling me and making crazy threats about having seen her.  I didn't take it too seriously because he doesn't have a very serious job as a Marine and I do, so I called and asked her to check her husband, she replied he wasn't her husband anymore.  I helped her out moving and fixing all the holes in the walls, and within a month of him deploying she'd left and bought her own house.  She was really adamant about refusing to take a dime from him, and our relationship happened pretty slowly the first year, seemed odd but I admired her independence.

We got married this summer, things were great, he was still himself but she didn't seemed phased by the screaming phone calls and crazyness, I told her to say it was harassment and that would shut him down.  Except it didn't, he waited until I was on a trip and he ramped it up pretty far, insults and harassment saying she's crazy and he'd take her daughter ect.  I contacted his unit and said he needed to back off.  That's when he took screen shots of my info and told my wife it was ""game on"".  She was terrified and I asked wtf was going on and he was all talk why so she scared and she blurted out that the reason the cops got called was he attacked her coming out of the shower her daughter came in with her MIL and saw the whole thing, and after he took her phone and keys she ran out barefoot and finished getting dressed out side before walking to the front gate of the base to report it.  That's the first time him telling those weird stories in front of her ALL the time made sense, he was humiliating her in front of anyone that stopped by.

He had bite marks to his hand and chest deep enough to scar, the cops on scene arrested him, gave her a citation she didn't have to appear for to cover their bases since he was bleeeing, and gave her a ride back home but didn't document any of her injuries.  His unit released him, put a restraining order and put him in counseling.  What they didn't do was give her any records of that, or charge him with any crime for choking her, and when they had a committee on it, they decided she was the aggressor for throwing a lotion bottle that didn't hit him so she could get to her pants.  She's 5'2"" 125lbs at most, he's 6'3"" 250+.   I had doubts about her story, how could he not get charged it sounds crazy, but the police report backs her story 100%, she won't even talk about anything she doesn't have proof because no one believes her already, and I've figured out there was a lot more.

Since I figured out their history, he has gone on to harass her every day since, harass me and her parents in another state, has started a custody dispute, records us at every interaction (legal in NC), the base refused to take the recent threats seriously, refused to charge or cite him for trying to slam her car door on her hands at the gate (because he refused to meet at the sheriff's office) ECT ECT

Has anyone ever gotten the DoD to take this seriously?  The sheriff wants a military protective order, the base cops recommend the sheriff, the lawyers say we need a report of a crime first, the domestic violence agency on base ignored her for a month and I had to initiate a case with them not doing their job to get them to do anything

I can't believe this but I worked at the base domestic violence center 15 years ago and I never would have stood by and allowed this, but now his unit and camp lejeune aren't doing anything.",metalman675triple,2020-02-16 13:44:57,3,815,34.24,85.16,5.29,1.97,35.43,13.5,90.06,57.91,21.23,16.81,4.17,0.86,0,10.67,1.1,4.42,6.38,12.15,8.83,4.17,8.22,2.7,19.14,2.7,0.98,0.86,1.6,1.72,4.54,0.86,3.68,0.74,1.6,0.12,20.61,1.35,0.25,6.26,5.28,12.64,1.84,2.45,1.47,3.19,0.98,3.93,2.45,0.49,1.23,0.49,0.86,0.74,0.25,0,0,9.2,2.82,0.86,2.82,2.33,0.74,10.43,6.01,0.61,13.5,1.96,6.75,4.91,1.72,0.49,1.1,0.25,0,0,0.25,0.25,0.12,0,0,0,13.01,3.07,4.66,0,0,0.12,0,0,0.49,3.68,0.74,0.25
f5170t,Domestic violence not from partner,"My story is not the usual. I allowed a young male family member to stay with my husband and myself for what was supposed to be a few days. He is now off his meds and back on substances and we have been looking for ways to get him to leave.
Today he shoved/hit me and tried to steal my phone. I called the police and I am getting the restraining order. I also changed the locks on the apartment. He is texting me calling me names and making threats like how he is going to have my husband deported and how he will kick my ass if he finds me.

f54orw,Difficult situation (long),"So I need some real advice and help. I came from an abusive ex husband. He got really physical with me a lot and would threaten to kill me and him, put out kids in harms way, He would take my keys so I couldn’t go anywhere, hold me down, sit on me and yell at me to my face, wouldn’t let me wear makeup or nice clothes (always looked like an old lady only), and I was NEVER allowed to hang out with friends or even go to the gym to workout (so I got super obese, gained 40lbs). Not only did I have an abusive ex-husband, but I was raped when I was 12.  It was bad.  Didn’t talk for a couple years. Those couple years of my life were literally blacked out and I have trouble remembering that time. My dad would tell me that I would break things and yell and shout and push people to get them away from me. I never had any formal counseling and am only now trying to get help after realizing I have trauma and ptsd that lashes out as anger ... and this is 22years of holding it in ... 

So back in October my boyfriend and I got into an argument one day about me not hearing something from him that I wanted to hear. He chose to walk away as he always does and start the shower. I got pissed he walked away from me so I went to the garage to get a hammer and then went to grab his phone to get his attention and started to yell at him to talk. I wanted nothing more than for him to listen and validate my fear and frustration however I took it out on him and started to threaten to hit his phone and him with the hammer. He then grabbed the hammer I was swinging towards him and was able to take it out of my hands but then I started to push him and shove him and slap him on his chest. All I could think of was how traumatic things were for me and that the only way for anyone to listen to me was to scream and hit. Anyway, he grabbed the hammer out my hands and grabbed my hands to stop me from hitting him and dragged me outside and told me to “cool off before coming back inside”. Well just that TINY part of him dragging me out of the house was recorded on our home doorbell camera and was reported to the security alarm company and they submitted it to be reviewed by local law enforcement.  Well now they are charging him with assault 4 DV (misdemeanor). 

Another incident happened on Christmas Day where we were leaving a family members house and heading home when he wanted to go spend time with his dad. Internally I was furious because I never really had family to spend the holidays with and felt like I was being abandoned again. I got angry at him and yelled and wanted to spend the day we could together without any separation. Anyway, I got out of our vehicle and my moms Pyrex glass I had in my hand fell out of my shaky hands from me being upset and breaks all over the ground. I couldn’t believe it! It was given to my mom for her wedding and then she gave it to me and I was even more upset. My boyfriend came around the truck and started to tell me to calm down as I was trying to sweep the glass. I was so irrational in my thinking I swept the glass literally everywhere and yelled at him to again get away from me and tried to push him with the large broom. Well he tried to grab the broom out of my hands and threw it over the fence. I was pissed and that made me reflect back to not having any control with my ex and to be honest ... I pushed him again and screamed at him to get away. I didn’t want to be alone again. I felt like it was always a repeat thing in my life with people abandoning me and wanted validation and compassion from him. I tried to grab his keys out of the truck so he couldn’t leave and begged him to stay and talk to me. He told me he would then come back home from his dads after I calmed down and just wanted some 1:1 time with him.  So eventually he drove off after I yelled and called the police and told them I needed help. I told the police he “pushed  me and threw my phone”. He never threw my phone though, I did out of anger when he threw the broom to get it out of my hands. 

Fast forward: Boyfriend now has TWO assault four charges that are considered both a misdemeanor. The first charge had an established “no-contact order” which I asked to be dropped and dismissed.  Well we had to go to court last week due to the October and Christmas Day incident and they re-established a “no-contact order” because the DA in the court room lied stating she saw me “dragged out by my hair” from the October video. SAY WHAT?!?!!!! I was never dragged out by my hair and he never hurt me, I did the hurting!!!! 

Now we have the two assault charges and no contact order and I’m trying to tell the courts and his attorney and everyone he didn’t do anything that I lied and over exaggerated. I was in the wrong and am now seeking the counseling I need from not one, but two different specialist. 

He has a daughter that the ex has and during my anger on Christmas Day I called her to talk and met with her. I was wrong. I went to the ex thinking she would get back at him for whatever I was mad at and now she’s blown things way out of proportion and overly exaggerating. Well because of the police report I filed from Christmas (only that day) the ex is running with that and telling people everywhere that I’m in an abusive household and in danger and he hits me and holds me hostage. We’ve never had that and I was the one that started the fight those two days. 

I’m not too sure how else to correct my mistakes and help and fix what I did. He never did anything and I feel so guilty and wrong for lying. I’ve written statements to the attorneys and submitted a motion on rescinding the current no contact order. But I’m not too sure what else to do??? 

Anyone please help. And please don’t judge .... I’ve had so much trauma and am trying to fix what I messed up.",iAmNoOneReal,2020-02-16 22:42:16,2,1161,37.73,43.15,64.13,1,20.37,12.75,93.11,61.58,20.07,16.11,10.08,0.6,0,5,0.43,3.96,4.74,15.42,7.49,5.77,9.73,2.41,18.78,2.5,1.21,1.03,1.12,1.38,6.2,1.38,4.82,0.78,2.58,0.43,12.49,0.95,0.69,0.95,5.08,9.13,1.12,0.69,1.98,1.64,1.72,2.15,3.45,0.26,1.55,1.64,1.64,1.12,0.43,0.09,0.09,7.84,2.15,0.95,2.84,1.55,1.03,8.61,7.15,0.69,16.8,3.1,7.41,6.63,0.95,0.69,1.38,0.26,0.34,0.09,1.46,0.17,0.09,0.09,0.43,0.17,11.28,5.25,1.12,0.17,0,0.43,0.86,0.34,0.86,1.38,0.86,0

f58grp,Neighbour is abused how can I help her?,"I live in a set of apartments. A couple live right next to me and the walls are paper thin I can hear everything. 

I'm not home much during the day but I always hear them arguing in late afternoon into the night. On days I have off I don't hear much so I think they're both gone all day and are only home in afternoons. 

When I listen to them arguing (and I'm not trying to pry but they're pretty loud so it's harder not to listen) it's clear that the guy is abusing her. I can hear her begging for him to stop hitting her. Things like that. When I first moved and heard them I knocked on there door to make sure everything was ok. The girl answered the door and said she was fine. So I left it alone 

But the other night I woke to what I thought was someone knocking on my door and crying? I went outside and it was the lady next door but she wasent knockin on my door she was knocking on her own door. Turns out her boyfriend had kicked her out at nearly 2 in the morning in freezing cold and she was only in her undies and a shirt. Not even any socks or shoes or anything right and ive got a jumper on and everything and I'm still cold so she must've been freezing. She told me he had her phone and keys and everything in her and wasent letting her back in. 

I offered her to come in to my place out of the cold. But she dident want to which is understandable since I'm a guy who lives alone and she dident know me. She also dident want to take anything from me I offered her clothes and to use my phone but I think she was a bit scared of me so didn't want anything from me. 

Anyway he eventually let her back in and I went back to sleep. But woke up later to the guy screaming at her and I could hear things being broken. 

That morning when I was on my way out to work I saw the girl again she looked very messed up had a swollen face and everything. I told her I could ring the police so she can get help. She told me not to. I asked her why and she just said to leave her alone basically. 

So I've been leaving her alone but the arguing seems to be getting worse it honestly sounds like the guy is gonna kill her or something. 

Is there anything I can do to help ? I know she dosent want help but I feel bad not doing anything 

I'm moving out of the complex soon and I feel so bad that I haven't helped this girl yet. 

I was thinking of just calling the police but I know they can't do anything if the girl refuses help right? And I also don't want to make things worse for the poor girl.

f5acwo,My girlfriend [23F] is emotionally and physically abusive to me [26M] when she drinks,"I started seeing my girlfriend in early August. Everything was great for the first few weeks until mid September when I discovered she had a drinking problem. She called me out of the blue one night and told me I needed to pick her up from a bar. I arrive, she’s drunk and hurling insults at me about how it took me too long to get there, how terrible I am, etc. She continues insulting me on the way home, walks in my house, and blacks out on the couch. I went to bed, a few hours later she climbed in bed and told me how sorry she was for what she did, cried, and told me it would never happen again.

Fast forward to today, there’s been around 15 of these episodes in the last 6 months. She gets drunk, turns aggressive and at times, violent. She also destroys things in my house. She’s broken a few cabinets, torn down shower curtains, tore one of my shirts in half, scuffed walls and knocked over lamps. Recently she took my briefcase, dumped out the contents on the floor (notebook, wireless mouse, papers, pens) and poured a glass of water on them. Also, she’s no longer apologetic about her actions. The morning after her latest rampage, she sent me a text and said “don’t even think about talking to me today”. 

In November, we were walking home from a bar and she punched me several times in the back. Just last week, during one of her drunken rampages, she threw both of our cell phones at me then tossed my iPad across the room. I picked up my phone and locked myself in my room. She chased me to my room, banged on the door and demanded I let her in. I opened the door as I thought she was going to break it. She told me she “knew what I was doing” and wouldn’t let me call the cops on her. She took my phone and stampeded off to the other side of the house. The next morning I told her to leave and she was furious. She has no place to go as she lives with me, but I wasn’t putting up with the abuse anymore. She calls me the next day and asks if she can come over that night as she’s tired and doesn’t have anywhere to go. I let her stay, she refused to talk about her behavior and just wants everything to go back to normal. 

I’ve offered to send her to a counselor and cover the cost, which she refuses. I spent an hour with a counselor and explained the situation, they believe she binge drinks to mask the trauma of her past. I also offered to attend AA with her and she agreed once, however, never followed through. She blames her drinking on me as I have a significantly higher income than she does and states I “watch her suffer”. She believes that if I truly loved her I would help her with things such as paying for her school, buying a new car, etc. This is nothing more than manipulation in my eyes. Keep in mind, she lives with me and does not contribute towards the mortgage, groceries, nights out, etc. 

I cannot even have a conversation with her regarding her drinking, she shuts it down immediately. At this point, is there any other option than leaving? Our relationship is incredible when she’s sober and we get along extremely well. However, when she drinks, all bets are off. 

Lastly, as hard to believe as it may be, her ex was physically abusive toward her. She’s traumatized by it which is why it’s so hard for me to comprehend her abuse towards me. She also had a somewhat difficult upbringing as she never met her father and her mother struggled to provide basic needs for her. I blame a lot of her behavior on her past and view her as a victim of it, which is part of the reason I’m still with her. I truly just want her to be happy and succeed in life, however, it’s becoming hard for me to believe she has any regard for me.

2/17 update: we attended two AA meetings last week. I thought she received them well. Things were fine until Saturday, one of her friends blew her off for lunch and she started an argument with me as a result. Things were pretty bad, she left Sunday and didn’t come home. She asked me if she could get her belongings today and leave. I’m heartbroken and want to fix things even though she’s treated me terribly. I still love her even though I shouldn’t. Last week she told me I meant the world to her and she would do anything to keep me in her life. Now she just wants to walk away. I feel like I’ve been used, manipulated, and dashed across the rocks now that she’s done with me.

TL;DR: my girlfriend is abusive both physically and emotionally when she drinks. She attended two AA meetings recently, but became emotionally abusive while sober over the weekend. She left, didn’t come home, and wants to retrieve her belongings. I can’t cope with losing her even though she’s treated me terribly.

f5bpw0,Broke &amp; need to escape abusive relationship?,"I know this is how it works in California at least .
Make sure you have less then $100 in any type of bank account then go to social services the same day you want to leave you’ll fill out some papers &amp; you will have to bring proof of abuse . Secretly record him/her being emotionally abusive , anything you can . Even a picture of your damaged belongings if you abuser has ever broke your stuff you’ll get a hotel voucher for 31 days you’ll have to do work programs threw them but it will keep your mind off negative things . Have your worker set up an interview with fss as soon as you get the hotel cause it can take a while to get an interview, they should be able to help with a shelter or security deposit on a new place .

f5hmcr,i cant relate,"most stories im coming across are very intense. i feel the situations are a bit stickier than mine and i'm finding it hard to relate to obvious intentional acts of inflicting pain,

for me the aggression feels more like lack of care?

my bf[26] and i[27] of 8 years broke up today. i accused him of being an abuser and we agreed we'd break up for the first time ever to work on ourselves.

our entire relationship he tried to make me feel like a queen
he's talented smart funny an incredible person
he encouraged me to be more confident, brave, courageous, open minded, educated, successful
whenever i feel scared to try something new or get on stage i can think of him and how bright he shines and it gives me confidence and reassurance. he's like my spirit guardian and i feel safe in the world knowing i can have peace with him. always trying to be sensitive when im depressed or ill. insanely invested in pleasing me sexually. open to new age concepts. always keen to move on from arguments and just be in good spirits when we're together. never wants us to go to bed upset with eachother. never ever moody or inexplicably grouchy. always there for me when i need him.

i don't feel worse about myself as a person after his angry outbursts. he always assures me im amazing no matter what has happened in the heat of the moment

i wouldnt be the person i am today without him, and i love me so much more than i did before i met him

are you guyss surreeeeeeeeeeee this is abuse

f5ic94,Proving abuse in court,"The court will not believe abuse against me or the children. CPS has been called numerous times but could not substantiate (were willing to say off the record they believed us, but needed to meet a certain standard). The judge cannot see it and won't talk to even the teenager who was abused the most. I have photos of bruises (they say photoshopped). I have videos of the kids talking about being abused (inadmissible because the court will not allow the children to testify). I have notes from the children and pictures (also inadmissible). One child was molested while my ex was in the room (I have photos of the room and the molester is serving a three year sentence; they say it wasn't my ex so it doesn't matter). I have doctor's notes that the children have come home dehydrated and without food (doctors are very expensive to call to court, so this is currently inadmissible). I have friends they've talked to about it (but it's seen as ""biased""). The same is true for my abuse. One of my children's therapists will testify they have been abused; the other children are not allowed therapy because my ex shares custody and will only permit therapy if my ex is present in the room. 

Many of the ""professionals"" involved won't believe even that I was abused, let alone the children, and I have journals, death threats written in my ex's handwriting, photographs, people willing to testify. Nobody cares, and, if they did, violence against a spouse doesn't seem to matter. Now my ex is abusing the children, including over-identifying my oldest as the same as myself. My ex goes to court and testifies that my oldest is psychotic, needs serious mental health help, and cannot be trusted. And court seems to believe it, even over the testimony of her therapist!   


How do you successfully overcome this? I have grounds for appeal, but will need to wait to permanent custody; this has drawn out for years at the serious detriment of the children.",TiamatsRage,2020-02-17 15:59:05,0,346,47.1,41.99,39.24,2.6,18.21,21.97,89.31,56.07,13.29,8.96,6.36,0.29,0.29,0.29,1.73,4.34,7.8,12.14,13.58,3.47,7.8,3.76,20.81,5.2,2.31,0.58,0.87,0.58,6.65,1.73,4.34,0.29,2.6,0.29,12.72,0.29,0.29,0.29,0,11.27,2.31,1.73,1.73,1.73,0.87,5.2,2.89,2.02,0.87,0,2.31,0,2.02,0,0.29,8.96,1.73,0.58,6.07,0.87,0.58,4.91,14.16,2.02,7.51,0.58,3.76,3.18,1.45,0.29,1.16,0.29,0,0.29,1.73,0,0,0,0,0,18.79,4.62,4.34,0,0.87,0.29,0.29,0.29,1.16,2.89,4.05,0

f5kztm,I recognized the red flags and heeded their warning.,"I’ve been seeing a man for a few months now that I really clicked with and thought there might be a future with. But over time I started to notice little things about his personality and his actions that concerned me.

Over the last two weeks I saw more and more of his true self beneath the charming exterior: the controlling behavior, the manipulation, the emotional immaturity, and the inability to accept responsibility. There were more but those red flags were enough. 

I ended it. And I am proud of myself for not falling back into that trap, for being self aware enough to end it before the abuse started. The person I was 10 years ago would have never seen the signs, 7 years ago I would have ignored them until it was too late, 5 years ago I was letting myself be used and disrespected in a relationship going nowhere.

f5lgre,My mom's abuse,"In February of 2019, the divorce between my parents was final. A few months later, my mom introduced me to her new boyfriend - a man I had never met before. I didn't like him at first. I mean, who would be willing to accept a new man in their mother's life just months after the end of a nearly 30 year relationship? 

I tried to like him. But something kept tugging at the back of my mind, telling me something was off. I ignored it and tried to convince myself it was just me not wanting anything new. But then that voice turned out to be right. 

I was at work one night sometime in November, when my phone rang. It was too late to be anything casual, and my concern grew seeing it was my mom.  I stepped out back to answer and was greeted with hysterical sobbing. 

She hadn't meant to call me, but I was in her favorites list and was right next to the person she had meant to call. I made her tell me what was wrong before my imagination went wild. 

Her new boyfriend had hit her. They had both gotten drunk, and gotten into a fight, and he had broken several bones in the side of her face. She had left the house and called the police, but when she came back he was gone. Scared and alone, she had tried to call a friend to come get her, but had called me by mistake. 

Fast forward a week or so. 

She's back together with him. She says she can fix him, she loves him. He just needs help and support, and she just needs to stay sober. 

My mother used to work at a domestic abuse shelter. These red flags should be as clear to her as they are to me, but for some reason they're not. But I keep my mouth shut, and try to support her. 

The end of January, 2020. My grandmother calls me, which is highly unusual. She tells me my mom's in the hospital, her boyfriend's been arrested, and she can't tell me anything else. 

So I wait. Losing my mind with worry. Two days go by.

My mother finally calls me to tell me she's home. Her (now ex) boyfriend had literally, actually, physically tried to kill her. Broke bones in her chest and face, bruised and damaged her windpipe. He literally choked her and stomped on her chest. She broke both hands fighting back. Her face was so swollen she couldn't see, and sent my brother to live with my dad until she was recognizable again. 

The ex went to prison. He hasn't been sentenced yet, but they expect between two and ten years in a state prison.

I guess my reason for posting this is to find some peace. I live across the country from her (I have for nearly two years now) and somehow I feel responsible. I should have told her how I felt when I met him. I should have been more firm with her the first time. 

She sent me a picture of the day she was released from the hospital, and it's all I can see when I think about her. It was meant to be a precursor to ""look how much better I look now!"" But it made me sick, and angry. 

I feel so alone in this. My own boyfriend's parents are happily married, and have been for nearly 40 years. None of my friends have ever gone through anything like this. How do I cope and get past this? Please, help me stop torturing myself.",tossawayposter,2020-02-17 19:43:57,1,611,24.88,64.68,48.57,7.11,11.98,12.77,95.09,58.76,22.26,18.66,9.82,0,0,8.18,0.65,3.6,4.09,11.95,9.33,5.73,7.69,1.47,20.79,4.91,1.47,1.64,1.8,1.64,5.24,1.64,3.27,0.33,1.15,0.98,17.84,2.29,1.15,7.69,3.27,11.29,2.62,1.31,1.8,2.62,0.65,2.78,2.62,1.31,0.65,0.65,3.27,1.47,1.47,0,0.16,6.71,3.11,1.8,0.82,0.98,0.65,10.31,9.82,0.49,15.55,2.45,5.73,8.84,0.65,0.33,0.49,0,0,0.16,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,16.53,7.69,4.75,0,0,0.33,0.16,0.16,0.33,2.45,0.65,0

f5mzej,My ex abuses me and threatens to have my son taken away from me,"Can someone please tell me what I can do about this? My heads been very messed up and I've no idea what is real or not anymore.

My ex boyfriend sexually abuses me. We are not together anymore but I still live in the same house. I can't afford to move out on my own. We have a 1 yr old son and my ex constantly tells me that if I move out I can't take my son with me because he will go for full custody and win and I'll never see him again. 

I am so very distressed. My son is my life! I love that kid more than anything. I'm so terrified of losing him. 

Me and my son sleep in a different room. But my ex won't ever let me shut the door says it's his house he makes the rules. He'll come into my room at night and just demand sex. He hits me when I try hiding from him. Everytime I always say no and try to make him leave. He's a pretty big guy and can be very intimidating. It's hard to fight him off of me and I usually never can. it's also very traumatising since I'm trying to be quiet so I don't wake Bub up because I don't want him to see something like that. 

I threaten to call police but he just laughs and says I wouldn't because then I'd lose my son 😔 

He has videos on his phone of me doing some illegal drugs and doing sexual things. But these videos are from ages ago and I'd never do anything like that now that I have my son! He says it dosent matter and that he can report the videos anytime he likes and I'd lose all custody of my son and go to jail. And that he would never let me see him again. 

I don't understand what I'm suppose to do. I'm so terrified of going to anyone for help or reporting anything in case they take my son away. He's not in danger I'd never put him in any danger I'm just so scared of losing him. 

I'm so terrified it takes such a toll on me mentally I'm always stressing. I feel so stuck in my situation I don't see any way out.

f5vhmc,Unsure of what to do,"My (40F) spouse (44M) has been verbally abusive since we've first gotten together.  It used to be far and few between, however.  When he was working, he was often busy and happy, and didn't have all this time to just sulk and pick me apart.  It's become unbearable lately, compounded by the fact that we no longer live in the city and are more isolated.  He's just a miserable person who refuses to get a job or at least a hobby.  I'm the sole bread winner, and even though we have more than enough money for both of us to live on, he makes all the decisions about how we spend it and penny pinches everything to death.  If I were to spend money on something without asking first, he'd flip out.

In some of his darker moments, he has threatened to kill me, or to kill himself.  He has often broken things in the house, or threatened to break one of my work computers.  He is a little hard of hearing and often can't understand what people say, which makes him angry.  If he can't understand something I've said, he immediately starts screaming at me and mocking me.  If we get into a fight in the car, he will swerve on the road, slam the breaks or just drive like a maniac to scare me.  He absolutely cannot take a joke, and will become angry if he thinks someone is ""disrespecting him"" in that way (by joking).  

He also has a very bad reaction to surprises or being startled.  We have an old house on our property that's falling apart.  We went to look it a few months back, to see if maybe there was something we could salvage from it.  He had walked into one of the rooms, and I was looking at the floorboards in the doorway, from outside the house.  I accidentally dropped a board and he immediately flipped out, screaming, ""how could you do that!  you made me think the house was falling!"" and as I was looking down, the next thing I knew sever pain in my head, and tasted blood in my mouth.  He had thrown a board across the room and hit me across the forehead.  I almost fell down backwards.  I felt dizzy and sick.  He was still screaming like some kind of ape, but I couldn't see what he was doing or make it out.  I had screamed out in pain, which somewhat slowed him down, but he still wasn't that concerned.  I started screaming back that I was leaving and started heading towards the house.  He followed.  He kept begging me not to leave, to let him see what he'd done, and he was ""horrified.""  I kept telling him ""f\*\*\* you, I'm leaving"" through tears and eventually we made it to our house.  He kept putting ice on my head and was somewhat apologetic, but I wasn't saying anything back.  I was still dizzy and in shock.  My head was super swollen.  When he wasn't getting the response he wanted he started saying things like ""just wait until you do something to me- I'm going to celebrate on it.""  Of course I reminded him that I've never thrown anything at him, or acted like that ever.  He kept saying it was an accident, but eventually conceded that he knew I was in the direction of that piece of wood he threw at me.   Even days later, he was still mad at me for ""making him feel bad"" about my getting injured. 

Sadly, I think I should have called the police then.  I didn't only because my family was coming to visit us in two days and I didn't want to upset the timeline.  I thought maybe when they were here visiting things would be better.  He was normally OK when family or other visitors came, but he was really awful during this trip.  On the bright side I was finally able to come clean with my family about just how awful he is, plus it made explaining the bruise on my forehead much easier.

It's impossible living with him lately.  Everything is my fault.  Everything...  I know it might sound dramatic, but sadly, this is how it is in his mind.  He refuses to take responsibility for his actions.  His apologies are non-existent.  He's told me that he feels it's ""his right to correct"" people or bully them if they do something stupid.  He's just horrible and now it's to the point where it's not even livable being with him.  He doesn't really have any friends.  He has one friend from his 20s that he talks on the phone with once in a while, but he yells even at him every now and then for ""not making sense when he talks"", ""talking about stupid things"", or ""talking like a highschooler.""  

I know I need to leave.  I just need to figure out when and how.  It's complicated because we have a farm, and I'm afraid of what will happen to the livestock if I just leave.  It's becoming unbearable though, and I'm afraid of what he might do.",justwantpeace12,2020-02-18 09:38:55,4,864,16.46,60.06,54.28,1,15.43,13.77,95.25,64.47,23.15,16.32,6.6,1.62,0.46,7.29,0.35,6.83,4.86,13.19,11.46,7.52,8.56,1.97,22.57,3.94,1.74,2.43,0.81,1.85,5.79,1.04,4.63,1.16,1.62,0.58,14.35,0.46,0.23,0,7.29,15.28,2.43,2.31,2.08,4.63,1.27,5.32,3.47,0.93,1.62,0.69,2.2,0.93,1.16,0,0.23,6.25,2.55,1.04,1.5,1.16,0.69,7.29,10.76,1.39,16.67,3.36,7.75,6.02,1.04,0.93,1.39,0.69,0,0.35,0.23,0,0,0.23,0,0,18.98,6.37,4.86,0,0,0,0.23,0.23,2.31,3.59,0.69,0.69

She has always made excuses for bruises and things by saying it was play fighting, she once had a black eye and said she just dropped her phone on her face which is clearly not the truth but has recently openly admitted he hits her out of anger. The way he speaks to her is discussing saying that he is a man so he has authority and can do what he wants and just always being aggressive in how he speaks to her ( a vile human ).

He hits her, strangles her while whispering in her ear that he is going to kill her and threatens her but she says 'he does not mean to do it'  and that she loves him but has also said she is 'scared to leave him because she thinks he would kill her if she tried to break up with him'

He is overly controlling to the point where if she likes another boys photo he goes crazy at her but he has so much worse on his phone. He goes to people's houses and smashes there windows and completely wrecks their cars (scary guy)

f67kzr,Confused and not sure if he actually changed or not,"Really confused about what is going on and would appreciate any advice. 


Have been married to my husband for several years. Sometime in the last two or three years he started holding me down during fights, covering my mouth, and preventing me from leaving. Was very calm every time he did this and didnt see anything wrong with it. He said he did it because of how I acted during fights. I felt like it was my fault for the longest time until he left for a trip and I had time to reflect. I told him it scared me and made me wonder what else he could do to me and almost left him. He promised it would never happen again and took full accountability. 


I looked up those DV lists that describe how to tell an abuser could actually change and he fit those lists to a T. Took all of the blame, agreed that we should do solo counseling, took full accountability, admitted it was violent and not okay by any means, gave me space, understood it would take time to forgive and trust him, etc. 


It's been almost a year and he hasnt done any of what he used to do. If I bring it up and want to talk about my feelings he listens and never gets defensive. However, a month or two ago he started randomly grabbing my hair or pushing me down when I've done/said stuff he doesnt like? Like when we are joking around? It's just weird and confusing. When I try to talk about it he says he's exerting his dominance or something along those lines and sometimes acts serious but other times acts like it's just a big joke? I just end up dropping it because it doesnt go anywhere and I start to feel like I'm overreacting. 


He acts like I'm overreacting and says he doesnt do anything to me during fights and gets really, really hurt if I say it's abusive and I start to feel bad. He doesnt touch me anymore during arguments and doesnt prevent me from leaving or anything and hasnt in almost a year so I am just confused. Idk why he started doing the ""dominance"" or whatever thing but it is just confusing. I know couples play fight and we do too sometimes but when this happens I dont know it doesnt feel like play fighting. 


He is so wonderful in so many ways and is NOT abusive in a lot of ways so what is happening is just confusing to me. He doesn't yell at me, isnt controlling, supports my career, never name calls me. I dont know why he started doing the whole ""exerting my dominance"" thing or what the point of it is? I dont know what to think. I was very hopeful when I looked up all of those things back then and he was doing everything those sites said people who change do and in a year nothing has happened but now I am just torn between worrying if things will slowly escalate to how they used to be or worse or if things have changed and I am making a big deal out of nothing.",throwawayyy769854,2020-02-18 23:58:53,2,549,4.93,25,73.52,1.8,20.33,14.75,95.45,64.48,22.59,13.84,8.01,0.55,0,5.1,0.18,8.74,2.91,11.29,11.84,8.01,11.48,4.37,23.13,2.73,1.64,3.28,0.55,1.82,8.38,2.73,5.65,1.46,2.73,0.18,11.48,0.36,0,0,5.28,20.04,3.1,2.91,2.37,7.29,2,6.38,3.46,0.55,1.46,1.46,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,5.65,0.91,0.73,2.19,1.09,1.28,7.1,14.03,0.91,14.75,2.19,5.1,7.83,0.36,0.73,0,0.36,0,0,0.36,0,0.18,0.18,0,0.18,9.65,4.01,2.37,0,0,0.73,0,0,0.73,1.64,0,0.18
f68n49,Physical Abuse (Advice Needed),"As stated in the title, I am dealing with physical abuse. My husband (30M) has been physically abusive towards me and LO, but this isn’t entirely about him, it is also about me (25F) . While I have never been the first one to initiate a physical altercation, I have fought back and now I want to know what I can do to break the cycle and heal from my past wounds. 

I would like to state that I have been going to therapy, but because of where I am located and what is offered to me I can’t speak to my therapist about any of this. During our first meeting together she told me that if I told her anything regarding physical abuse than she would have to report it to the authorities so out of fear of losing my child I have not been able to get the help I need. 

So here is a little bit of what’s going on: 

The first time my husband got physical it wasn’t directed at me, but LO while LO was still an infant. One night, when LO woke up crying my husband woke up with LO. (This rarely happened because he would usually be too intoxicated to help.) Well, while my husband was out in the kitchen with LO I heard LO cry in a way I had never heard him cry before so I got up to check it out. I tiptoed and looked around the corner and saw my husband holding LO, who was maybe 2 1/2 months old at the time, out and away from his body while he screamed “stop crying, stop crying, please stop crying” and then he pulled LO into his chest and cradled him while he forcefully tried to push LOs pacifier in LOs mouth, but my husband kept missing and instead of remaining calm he let out a scream and started to shout “stop, stop, stop, stop” over and over again like some crazy person. I immediately made my way over to them and gently took LO out of my husbands arms and asked him what his problem was, but before he said anything I could already see it on his face. At some point during the night my husband had snuck out of bed to drink the alcohol that he had stashed somewhere in the house. Once I realized that he was intoxicated, I just turned around and tried to walk away but my husband grabbed me by the arm and then attempted to pull LO out of my hands. I screamed at him and told him to stop, but he wouldn’t so I slapped him across the face. That slap shocked both of us because up until that point neither of us had ever been physical with the other. I immediately felt horrible for what I did, but I really didn’t know what else to do and also wasn’t fully thinking. So I apologized for hitting him and decided that while I wasn’t proud of myself for what I did, it was a one time thing and that would never happen again. 

The next time we had a physical altercation I had discovered that he was keeping nude pictures of his ex girlfriends on his computer and that he was watching porn(but not having sex with me). This really hurt my feelings because I had literally just had an open and and very honest conversation with him about how I was struggling with my self-confidence because he wasn’t even trying to have sex with me and I felt like it was because he didn’t like my postpartum body. He said he understood why I felt the way I did and reassured me that the only reason he wasn’t trying to have sex with me was because he was waiting for me to initiate it because he knew how exhausted I was from taking care of LO. Anyways, after I found the pictures and the porn I brought it to his attention, but instead of apologizing he literally told me to “stop being so insecure” so instead of continuing the conversation I packed a bag for LO and myself and arranged for us to stay in a hotel. As I was on my way out the door, my husband blocked the exit and told me that he wasn’t going to let me leave because he thought I was overreacting. He literally said “I’m not letting you leave. You are just overreacting.” So I asked him to move and when he didn’t I pushed him out of the way and started to push the stroller past him, but then he grabbed my arm and pushed me in the corner and I don’t know why but something in me flipped and I lost control. I pushed him back and beat on his chest and cursed at him and told him if he didn’t let me leave then I would call the cops. He eventually moved aside and then I took LO and we left for a few days. 

The above stories are from this time last year, but now things are getting completely out of hand. Every time my husband gets drunk he will corner me or get in my face until I start getting defensive and push him away from me. Just the other day he did this, but when I pushed him away he twisted me around and put me in a headlock. He pulled back so hard that my feet came off the ground and I was unable to breathe. When I was able to get my feet on the ground I jabbed him in the ribs with my elbow and then I pushed his arm up and away from my neck. He was still squeezing, but now his arm was around my mouth so I bit him hard, so hard it left a mark. 

Things are really terrible and I know that I should leave, but husbands parents, who are also alcoholics as well narcissistic and manipulative people, have been looking for any excuse to get their hands on LO. I’m worried that if all this came to light then the courts would give them custody or GPR. Please trust me on this, they are not good people and this would be a really terrible thing!

While I am being completely honest I want to say that I do have a past involving physical and mental abuse. My mother was physically and mentally abusive towards me while I was growing up. When I was about 15 or 16 she had me backed in a corner while she repeatedly slapped me across the face and punched me in the back of the head. I screamed, I cried, and I begged her to stop, but she wouldn’t so I had to shove past her and run upstairs to my room. I didn’t have a lock on my door so I pushed my bed and dresser up against the door so that she couldn’t get in, but that didn’t stop her from trying. My mother followed me up the stairs and started to slam her body into the door while she screamed at me for shoving her. Realizing she would not be getting in unless I wanted her to she grabbed a pack of cigarettes, lit one up and blew the smoke under my door and into my room (She did this because she knew how much I hate/hated cigarettes). While she blew smoke under my door I packed a bag and made a plan to runaway and then I did. I didn’t get very far and was only gone for a couple of hours when I was picked up by the police and taken to the station. I can’t really remember what happened next because the second the police had picked me up and took me to the police station where my mom was waiting for me, I had an out-of-body experience. What I do know is that I told them what happened and that I didn’t feel safe at my home, but for some reason they released me back into her custody. 

Another time I was physical in my life. I had just graduated from HS and went to a party that my friend invited me to. She had a huge crush on this guy who had gone to another school and wanted me to be there for her so I agreed to go. The party was fun at first and I had a great time until one of the guys college aged brothers brought drugs and I decided that, that was my cue to leave. I asked my friend if we could go and she said sure but she wanted me to give her “like 15 more minutes” so I told her that, that was fine and I would be waiting for her outside in her car. While I was walking to her car I ran into this guy that I was aquatinted with (His mother and father worked with my grandma) and we started talking. I was leaning with my back against my friends car when all of sudden I realized this guy was getting uncomfortably close so I tried to cut the conversation short and was like “well, I should go check on my friend” but thats when he trapped me between him and my friends car. He then asked if he could kiss me and I replied with a firm NO, but he didn’t stop there. He then got closer and asked me if I was sure! I put my hand on his chest and gently pushed him away while I said “yes, I am sure. Please stop!” But then he leaned in so I kneed him in the balls and punched him in the throat and then I ran away. 

Both of these were serious issues and I obviously know that I was acting in self-defense, but because of these and a few other instances I now feel like any time I am cornered or I feel trapped or scared my first instinct is to fight. I obviously don’t like feeling this way, but I never went to therapy for this before and now I don’t know how to make peace with it so that I can move forward and live a peaceful life. I swore when I had children I would never raise my hand at them and that I would make sure to raise them in a peaceful environment.  So please help me, what should I do when I find myself trapped in a corner? 

TL; DR:

I am currently in an abusive relationship with my alcoholic husband. Every time he drinks he physically backs me into a corner or does something that makes me feel threatened and because of past trauma when he does things like this my first instinct is to fight him.

Speaking to a therapist or leaving my husband are not options at the moment. So I want to know how can I heal past trauma and what should I be doing when I feel trapped?",throwaway986327,2020-02-19 01:49:04,1,1867,19.49,28.51,88.91,17.93,27.46,13.12,94.27,64.33,23.09,18.26,11.68,0.43,0.11,5.62,0.43,4.77,4.5,13.55,8.84,6,11.14,1.98,18.8,2.57,0.91,1.93,1.02,1.23,4.61,2.04,2.57,0.43,0.7,0.59,11.68,1.18,0.54,1.82,5.14,11.41,1.87,1.82,1.93,1.61,1.07,4.23,2.62,0.48,0.86,1.23,4.07,1.77,1.71,0.32,0.59,7.39,2.2,1.34,2.14,1.18,1.02,9.21,6.32,0.96,18.1,3,8.09,7.45,0.54,0.54,0.75,0,0,0,0.32,0,0,0.05,0.16,0.05,9.69,3.32,2.57,0.11,0.05,0.11,0.16,0.21,0.75,1.55,0.75,0.11

f6bdle,I(22F) got my abusive ex(29M) arrested and I regret it a little bit,"Before you ask why I didn’t leave sooner, I just couldn’t. I loved him a lot and he was nice to me sometimes so I excused the abuse as just a hiccup in his journey to becoming better. I still love him very much. We had been dating for a year now.  We live in the same residence but different buildings but we were always together, 24/7. I did everything with him. He didn’t do everything with me though. 

Just a little backstory, he was very emotionally abusive at first, calling me names, insults, degrading me and some empty threats. He was physical last year when he slammed me into a wall by my face. The police were involved and we were told to not see one another. But we ended up getting back together.   

Things were better. He loved me back (he didn’t like me a lot before the break we had but apparently missing me made him love me since I told him these words first and I do mean them) and he was trying to respect me again. He was not shoving the pressure of going to the gym down my throat(he really wanted me to be skinny and I am chubby), he told me he wouldn’t take me for granted and he did improve for a week. We were fine.   

But then arguments started again. I guess I initiated it because he got really mad at me for initiating it but it was because I wasn’t comfortable with something and I was trying to talk but he didn’t want to listen and it turned into an argument (this happened every time I wanted to just talk because even talking is considered arguing according to him). It started to go down a bit. It went up and down.   

He became physical a few weeks ago when he tried to kill me by choking me. And yes, he told me after that he was about to kill me. I don’t remember after that the other incidents after that because I’m concussed and my memory is very very faint from past trauma and drug abuse.   

3 days ago while he was asleep, I had woken up and I was changing the podcast playing on his phone and a girl messaged him. I checked. I felt bad doing this but I did it, he was flirting with her. It hurt a lot so I left with majority of my items and left him texts about how I couldn’t believe I trusted him.   

He woke up and called me asking what’s up and I told him I’d tell him in person because he would try to twist my words. And I didn’t want my roommates to hear. I went over and into his room and he asked me again, “So why are you mad?” And I replied “You know why, if you love me and you did something THIS hurtful then you would know what it is” and it was a bit back and forth. I’m sorry for being stubborn, I was just very emotional at that moment.  

He then proceeded to punch me and slap me and throw me around. He kept doing this and I used all I could to push him away and he landed in a pile of clothes. He got up and he took my pinky finger and twisted it super hard. It is now bent and it’s super blue and bruised. It just looks really bad.   

I pushed him away but he took me and pushed me onto the pile of clothes and got out a knife from god knows where. He tried to stab me and I kept kicking him off and I got up and he kept backing me into a corner with the knife. The knife was gone I don’t remember how, but I kicked him really hard in the balls and this made him super mad. He started punching me hard in the face and bit me and punched my ribs and just everywhere. It was just crazy.  

I decided to message a friend who I left because she warned me against him and so I isolated myself. She drove to me right away and took me away. Took me to our college security and then police. We did the report and they took pictures of all the bruises.   

And the whole night when I’m back home (I begged my friends to let me sleep at my place because it’s where I’m comfortable and he had already been arrested so he wouldn’t be near me) I remembered the amazing moments. They were raw and so passionate. I miss his hugs, his cologne, his pretty smile, the way he’d call me monkey. It just all came clashing down and I was regretting it. 

What did I do??? Why did I do this he’s gone now etc etc and imagining him sitting in a cell the whole night was hurting me bad because it’s cold and he’s alone..I loved him a lot.   

I had a dream last night that he came back and he forgave me and everything was fine and happy and I woke up and it was just shit. I can’t go back to him but I just want to know how can I move on from this? I’m still very deeply in love with him and it’s paining me to be away from him. How do I move on? How do I carry on a normal life? I’m nauseous all the time and I can’t think. I just want the good part of him back.   

Also I come from an abusive family so I was very used to abuse, it’s kind of normal for me? And I’m trying to get rid of being okay with it but it’s still hard for me.   

TL;DR: I reported my abusive ex bf and now he’s arrested but I miss him a lot and can’t cope with being without him. How do I move on and stop wanting to go back to him?",idontlikepadthai,2020-02-19 06:28:26,5,1027,9.11,44.59,65.97,16.08,16.3,11.98,95.52,65.34,26.1,21.23,12.07,0.88,0.58,7.4,0.29,4.87,4.38,11.1,9.54,7.01,10.71,1.75,20.06,4.09,1.07,1.85,0.58,2.14,7.11,3.21,3.89,0.19,1.85,1.17,14.41,0.1,0.39,0.39,7.21,11.78,1.75,2.53,1.66,1.75,0.97,3.31,1.75,0.39,0.29,0.97,2.73,0.97,0.97,0.1,0,8.47,2.73,1.66,2.04,1.56,0.78,10.42,7.69,0.58,15.38,2.63,7.11,6.33,0.49,0.49,0.49,0,0.19,0.19,0.58,0.1,0.1,0.19,0,0,13.44,5.55,1.75,0.1,0.1,0.88,0,0,0.39,3.41,1.17,0.1
f6eom3,Black eye and years of DV,"
Hi there. Forgive me if this is long. I have cross posted to legal advice just in case. 

I’ve been married to a little over ten years to a narcissistic military service member. In years past, we have tried counseling to no avail as he would gaslight any and all issues pertaining to emotional, verbal and mental abuse. While he’d never hit me before, he would corner me and man-handle me if I tried to get away from him when he was belittling me. Any physical aspect of his abuse was never addressed as the consequences of it being disclosed would end up killing his career. 
We do have a child together, and I haven’t worked the entire time we have been married. 

He filed for divorce a few years ago and we withdrew our petition shortly after - he’d moved all finances into his own account simply because he could and knew I’d have a hard time even hiring a lawyer to have judge grant me access to it. Honestly, I couldn’t afford to fight our divorce as I have no outside financial resources, and he used the divorce as a power move to begin with. 

Once we “reconciled” his account stayed the same and we added financial abuse to the mix. 
I’ve been feeling trapped in the situation because I don’t have a degree, haven’t worked in over eleven years, and only have access to money as needed (if I need to buy groceries, etc, he’ll transfer a couple hundred bucks into our joint acct at a time). 

This weekend he went to swat my face and I ended up with a black eye. 

Obviously there’s a shift of power now in the sense that he knows I can end his career if I file a report. Which. I won’t because it will affect my child more than child deserves. 

Husband is doing what abusive husbands do: regrets it, feels awful, won’t ever do it again, etc. 
has agreed to postnup and is changing pay back to joint acct etc as the beginning of proving he knows he’s been wrong. 
I have already told him that child and I will be moving back to our home state at least for a while until he starts getting the help he needs and I do as well. 

Seeking advice on the following:
How effective is a postnup in this situation? Looking for guarantees in regards to alimony, child support, and my ability to stay in home state should a reconciliation be impossible without risking losing my right to our home/equity in the state we currently live in. 
Would he be able to say later that the postnup should be invalid because he entered into it under duress? (because I’m making it clear that he can either agree to basic guarantees or I can go through with reporting physical abuse and seek order of protection and the right to move that way)

I guess. What’s my best course of action here that doesn’t involve ruining his career but also provides me with the same shift in power protection that I feel I finally have right now?

If I need to add more detail and/or clarify to get better advice, I can do so.

f6f2bo,Over it. But not really.,"LONG-  I (35F) have been married to my husband (35M) for 17 years this year.  In those years we've had a LOT of issues with infidelity and anger.  Shortly after getting married, my husband ""caught me talking to a guy I  met at work"". But he didn't actually catch me doing anything. The wife  of the guy I gave my number to found it and came up to my job, followed  me home, then told my husband. She was a total nut job. We'd never even  actually spoken on the phone. Turns out that guy had been messing around  with a lot of women on her. I was just the most accessible. My husband  was so hurt even though it never went anywhere. I accepted this  responsibility because even though it didn't had I fully intended to  talk to this man in a way I shouldn't have been. Anyway, fast forward a  year and I'm pregnant with our first child. I find out he's ""talking to""  a girl at work. I confront him he claims it's done. I think I can't  really get mad because of what I'd done. I let it go. A year after that  we're in bed late one night and and his phone rings (his friends name  pops up). I shake him awake and tell him his friend is calling he looks  at it and hits ignore. Friend calls right back which I find highly  unusual. the next morning I ask him what the urgency was about. He says  ""oh he just wanted to invite me to a party"". I said ""so he called you  twice for that?"". He just shrugged. I look through his phone, get the  number, and call it from my phone. A woman answers. I ask her how she  knows him. She tells me that she didn't know he had a wife just a baby  mama and a kid. I confront him, he says she's lying he only knows her  through his friend and they all smoke weed together that's why her  number was saved that way. Again, I let it go because of how much I hurt  him talking to that random guy. Fast forward two more years and he  actually sleeps with another woman. I only found out because he was  black out drunk and left his tagged (didn't even know he had one or even  what it was) account open. I read messages between them and she's  asking him why he didn't finish and if he'll come back again. I show him  he cries and pleads. I leave for a while but I'm pregnant with our  second child. He convinces me it was a terrible mistake, he didn't even  finish bc he knew it was wrong. I move back. Things are good for a  while. We have our 3rd kid. About 4 years after that incident he goes on  a business trip out of country for 3 months. In that time he grows  increasingly distant. He's hard to get a hold of. And when I do he acts  as if I'm bothering him. When he gets home I ask him to use a condom and  he does with no protest. And actually finishes with the condom . This  is significant bc he's NEVER done this in all our years together. I ask  him if he was up to something again. He denies it. For our oldest kids  birthday that year we took her to an amusement park. He goes to get n  the roller coaster with them and asks me to hold his phone. While it's  in my purse I can feel it going crazy so I pull it out thinking it must  be something important. I see messages from a woman he met while on the  trip. They're talking about love and marriage, and kids. He sent her a  tablet and money bc she was having a hard time. He doesn't deny it this  time bc he can't it's all in black and white. I leave. But somehow he  convinces me to come back. It takes a while but eventually we move past  it. Though when we argue and I'm saying how many times he's hurt me he  STILL brings up this one guy that I ""talked to"" to justify all of the  mess he's pulled on me. It's been a few years since the last cheating  incident but in 2017 he punch holes in ours walls while he was drunk and  said he'd kill me if I ever tried to leave him while holding me by the  neck. He's also yelled at our oldest child that they should get their  stuff and get the f\*ck out with me but I can't take his boys. Each time  he's gotten like this he's been drunk. The final episode happened in  2019. He was drunk and I heard him call his Mom and sister and say that  he was going to kill me.  I'd been pulling away and I guess he could  feel it. I'd also started a new job making substantially more than I did  before. He wanted me to quit and stay at home even though our youngest  is in school now. His Mom called me later and said it was all about  control and I should leave him before he really hurts me. I asked him to  move out and he did. It's been over a year now. How pathetic is it that  I still love this man? I get angry when I think about all he's done and  how he's made me feel. But then I think about when he's the person I  met and fell in love with like over the last year. He says he's a  changed person and he's stopped drinking but I just don't know what to  do. My heart always over rules my brain when it comes to him. I haven't  told anyone any of this outside of when my in-laws know from last year.  I've always been ashamed of how weak I was and how I let the fear of  raising my children alone keep me in what I know is an unhealthy  situation. Why can't I let go?

f6isce,Everyone is warning me to leave,I have a few other posts here on reddit that you can read. Everyone I talk to either here or in my real life have been telling me that this relationship has turned abusive. I want to try to leave but have no means of doing so yet. My other posts explain why but long story short I am stuck in a fairly isolated town with no friends or family. I have been given no money at all. No money has been put into the joint account and when he does it's to look good because he knows I tell my mom...but he takes away my debit card. I had money stored in my cookie jar that has also all been taken. I also do not have a job out here I quit my job to move with him and jobs are far and few in between here. Yesterday was a bad day. He ended up swearing at me and yelling at me because I asked to sit down and have a conversation. I'm completely isolated here and have nobody to talk to. He said he wouldn't have to swear at me if I wouldn't pester him basically. He took me out for supper and of course is very sweet in public to me but once at home he claims I give him no alone time I'm always just fucking here in the house when he comes home from work...there's literally nowhere for me to go here in town I know nobody and everything closes by 5pm. He tries to intimidate me when hes angry by ripping his hair out and punching himself in the face. He has raised a fist to me and has punched the bed when I was laying on it but hasn't hit me yet. He had made comments supposedly as a joke that he has an in with the cops. I'm terrified at this point of him. I keep looking at the clock seeing he will be home in a few hours and it give me anxiety.,Icantoteyeregg,2020-02-19 14:39:01,1,350,22.09,29.35,70.81,1.91,18.42,10.29,94.86,65.14,21.14,16.57,10.29,0,0.29,6,0,4.57,4.29,15.14,11.71,6.57,8.29,3.43,22,3.43,0.57,1.43,0.29,1.71,4.57,0.86,3.71,0.57,1.71,0.86,12,0.57,0.29,0.29,6,10,1.14,1.14,1.14,1.71,2.29,3.71,1.71,0.86,0.57,0,1.71,0.29,0.29,0.29,0.86,4.86,1.14,1.14,0.86,1.14,0.57,5.14,14.57,0.29,16.29,2.29,10,4,1.71,1.14,1.71,1.43,0,0,0.57,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,9.14,6.86,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.29,0,0

f6mnky,I packed up and left after my alcoholic boyfriend abused me,"I [23M] had been with my boyfriend [30M] for over 2 years. It started out great; we had a very strong connection, talked all the time, travelled together, and supported one another emotionally. I realized that he drank a lot early in the relationship, but didn't see any red flags since I was a young college student and was comfortable with party/drinking culture. He moved in with me after losing a job, and I could definitely see his drinking more as a problem than as something he just did for fun. I would tell him how I wasn't comfortable with the amount he drank, but he would always refute what I said and claim it was 'normal' and it was like he was on vacation since he wasn't working. He would basically walk to the liquor store every day while I was at class and pick up a few things  such as wine, a pint of vodka, a few of those little airplane shots and would do this every day. He would hide some stuff from me because he knew I didn't like it. Sometimes he would get too drunk and start saying hurtful things to me at night, and would mess up my ability to get school work done. 

After I graduated I moved away for a job, he started working again at that point but lost that job due to an injury and had to come move in with me again. This time his drinking was much worse. I kind of excused it because I knew he was in pain from the injury, but it became out of control. He was Ubering to the liquor store every day when I left for work, sometimes buying as much as a fifth of vodka and drinking the whole thing. I knew this wasn't good for him and certainly wasn't good for me. I was basically coming home to a pissed off drunk man every day and would be subject to verbal/emotional abuse on a nightly basis. He would try and hide his drinking from me but it was always obvious he was trashed. The first time he hit me was when I poured out the remaining bit of vodka from his bottle when I got home from work. I continued to just try and take care of him but he would frequently tell me I wasnt doing enough. He drunkenly hit me a few other times but it was never that bad.

One night I came home from work and he was super drunk (I left him cash for food but he spent it at the liquor store I suppose). We started argueing about something, and I got up to just leave our apartment for a bit but he took my phone and wouldn't give it back. I tried to forcibly remove it from his hands but he just started punching me in the face. I managed to grab the phone and got to the other side of our room but he managed to pin me down on the couch, kept hitting me and started strangling me while yelling that he was gonna kill me. I was able to get out of it and locked myself in the bathroom until he calmed down. I didn't hit back at all in this altercation, just tried to get away. I basically packed up my essential stuff and left, and never returned. 

This was about 3 weeks ago and I've been living in my car ever since. I told my friends and my family about the incident and my situation now, they are very supportive but live far away. I can't help but feel kind of stupid about this whole thing. First of all, I knew the relationship wasnt going well and I shouldnt have let it persist as long and it did. I guess he made me feel kind of trapped in a way. I continued to love him despite the drinking, the way I was treated, and the way I was expected to cater to his every need. Also I feel kind of stupid leaving him on the basis of physical abuse, since we are a gay couple and I am definitely a little bigger/more athletic than him. 

I don't really know how to process my feelings about this. I am experiencing a mix of emotions from relief to sadness to anger to regret. I know I made the right decision to leave but I still have feelings for him and hope the best for him. He wouldn't have done any of this to me if he didn't drink. I am definitely worried about him being okay on his own. I have texted him saying that it is over and that he needs to get support from family/friends for now on. He has been messaging me every day now saying that he wants me back and he loves me but I am not budging. Yesterday he started getting nasty and called me a horrible person for leaving and started making jabs at my biggest insecurities, and saying no one will ever love me because of my flaws. I feel really terrible now.

 I just figured I'd put my story up here because this is a very weird time in my life and I don't really know what to feel. Thank you.

PS: I previously posted about this on r/relationships but was told this would be a more appropriate place.

f758ya,My brother is abusing his girlfriend,"My brother is abusing his girlfriend.

I [F14]seriously need some help and advice. I’m not really sure where to start but my older brother who is turning 21 this year is abusing his girlfriend and she, who is 18 won’t leave him, or report it. They also have a baby girl together who is around 6 months old. This all started a few months ago, when my mum told me that when she went to visit them (they live in quite far away) he seemed quite controlling and she seemed scared of him, which I thought wasn’t normal. Anyways, she left it alone but was still very wary and kept in touch with his girlfriend. They text/call daily. One night she texted my mum saying that they were arguing and it got physical and my mum asked if he had ever hit her and she said no, but he had pushed her. Which is no surprise because he had always been controlling and violent, which I’ve experienced firsthand but never thought much of, because siblings fight right? Fast forward to tonight. My mum gets a text from his girlfriend, and she sent her pictures and videos of the marks he left on her face tonight. It looks bad. Like if she were to go out in public people may ask questions. It looked as if he had scratched and or slapped her. Naturally we were very concerned for her but to be honest I was not shocked at all. Sad to say, but thats my brother. My mum constantly told her to leave him, and report this to the police but she claims she loves him and that she does not want to lose custody of her baby. My mum was not really sure what to do because they live in a different country, about an hour away on a plane so theres not much she COULD do right then. She’s currently looking for plane tickets for next month to go visit and try sort this out, because when my she visits, his girlfriend seems to be most at ease when my mum’s around. I keep thinking about this, and how she said that she loves him so she won’t leave him but how can you love someone that clearly doesn’t love you? I just wish she could see this from an outsiders perspective, that he’s clearly manipulating her, he likes the power role, he always has. He’s not a good person. He messed up his own life at an early age, got involved with gangs and stuff, he messed up his own life and along with that he messed up mine, more than he even knows or cares to believe. He’s never changed and I really don’t think he will. I can’t even count anymore how many times we’ve tried to get him help. At this point I don’t care if he goes to jail. He’s probably better off in there anyways. He clearly doesn’t love us or her and its sad but I don’t think I do either. Please, if you have any advice on what me and my mum can do to help it would mean a lot because we are stuck right now. I’ve heard too many stories and I don’t want her to end up in a life threatening situation. Thank you so much for reading if you got this far.",lvdyflvcko,2020-02-20 19:41:11,6,574,6.51,87.49,15.1,31.72,17.94,12.02,95.82,61.32,24.74,18.82,5.23,0.7,0.87,10.98,1.05,5.92,2.44,10.45,9.76,6.97,10.1,3.48,20.56,4.01,1.57,2.79,0.7,2.44,5.75,2.96,2.61,0.35,1.22,0.7,24.39,2.61,1.22,6.62,6.62,15.33,2.26,2.09,2.26,4.36,2.09,5.75,2.44,1.05,0.87,0.35,2.09,0.17,1.05,0,0,8.36,4.53,0.7,2.44,1.22,0.52,6.27,12.54,1.39,14.81,2.61,6.45,6.27,0.52,0.35,0,0,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0.35,13.59,5.05,3.83,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,3.48,0.35,0.52

f7etor,Helping a friend?,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

So I really don't know where to start or what I can even do here, but I have a friend who is in a really bad situation and I'm just at a loss as to how help her. She had some sort of falling out with her parents, and this girl is already at absolute rock bottom - no self esteem, I believe she is also depressed as she told me she was on medication. The only offer she got as for a place to live was with her abusive ex, who literally assaulted her in early January. She accepted it because the mental manipulation goes deep and she still loves him (Or I guess the idea of him?) and believes he will change. She even stopped therapy because ""he is looking after me"" and ""it doesn't work"" - Which is contrary to what she told me not 2 months ago. 

I heard this on Monday and it absolutely crushed me because prior to the assault in January (which was unreported by her or even her family - she doesn't have faith in the police to her anymore as they failed before and her family do not want ""drama""), she always said she hated him and that she knew she was better than him etc. I tried to convince her that her abuser would not change, she wasn't that happy with what I said, as you might imagine and assumed I was being ""jealous or angry"" (We both kinda caught some feelings before, so that explains the jealous comment). But I know she is at absolute rock bottom and desperate right now so I get that she is clinging onto something here. She definitely doesn't need a relationship right now and she knows that because she told me so in December. She's gotten back with him in exchange for a home...I told her to go to a shelter, she said she'd rather not be raped in a shelter...Maybe I should have specified a womans refuge

I sent her a few messages this last week just to explain some things, and to apologise for a couple of things I'd said. and then last night she tells me not to message again as her boyfriend (abuser) had seen the last message I sent. And then, she randomly apologised to me - I told her she had nothing to apologise for and she said ""There is but I can't talk now"". I said ""maybe some day you can explain"" and she said back ""I don't think so, I don't know"". I ask her ""Why"" and she says she ""can't say"", and it goes on until she says that nobody can help her after I told her help is out there. And that it ""doesn't matter"".  The thing that makes that ""sorry"" even worse to hear is because the last time I said ""see you later"" she told me ""don't count on it"" and was mad at me, maybe rightfully - due to a couple of things I'd said. They were not offensive as such but tactless and I could have illustrated my point better. 

It's the ""I don't think so"" that gets to me, what on Earth is happening after five days of this relationship for her to say that?

I don't know what to do, or what I can do but I'm distraught, I want to do anything to help her out here, she's suffered a lot and I don't want this to go on for ages. Trouble is, I live in the UK and she is US based, I could theoretically allow her to stay in the UK and I made her the offer if she needs to get away from it all for a time but it's not the most practical solution and the help she really needs is over there - along with any hope of a support network and therapy. She just doesn't think anyone can help and frankly I don't think she thinks she is worth the help...

I'm sorry if this is a massive jumble and makes little sense or anything but my mind is a bit of a mess at the moment and I'm just in a state of disbelief. I now can't even message her directly to ask what is happening because what if I do and it gets her hurt? She basically begged me to stop messaging, she could easily have blocked me if she was still mad at me. The only solid information I have on her is a first name and phone number - no email yet and no last name. I know which state she lives in and a rough area but other than that, I don't know. I just don't want to sit back and let it happen because I was told before about her past and it obviously was awful. I understand that it is hard to help someone who doesn't want help/wont get it - but is that really just it, do I just have to wait and let it play out now? I just can't see any end to it for her, she is stuck in his house now and has no self esteem anymore, she told me ""I'm fucking worthless"" on Monday... I just know this isn't what she really wants but she can't see any other way right now. It's a really sad situation which I guess is replayed across the world daily. 

If anyone has any advice on how to handle this and do something, I'd be so grateful but I think to be honest there is little I can do now. I just hope I'm wrong. Until last night I'd planned to not initiate contact \*(Of course I told her she could always drop me a message if she needed)\* so I could try and relax and not impact my own mental health with worrying about it. But that short exchange has completely thrown me off again, it's very hard to just forget that someone you care about is suffering and they see no end to it and they can't even message people they care about anymore...",Throwaway19230705,2020-02-21 09:54:23,2,1027,7.82,55.41,34.43,7.66,27.76,10.81,96.49,66.21,24.73,16.94,7.69,0.19,0.39,8.18,0.49,7.79,4.19,11.49,11.1,7.4,9.25,3.99,21.42,4.28,2.14,1.95,0.29,1.66,5.06,1.75,3.31,0.29,1.36,1.07,17.62,0.29,0.39,7.59,0.88,15.77,2.92,1.95,2.53,4.28,1.27,5.06,2.73,0.58,1.56,0.49,0.97,0,0.68,0.19,0,6.52,2.73,1.07,2.43,0.88,0.78,5.36,16.46,0.78,13.63,1.27,5.94,6.82,0.39,0.68,0.39,0.29,0.1,0,0.39,0.1,0.1,0.1,0,0,17.04,4.28,2.73,0,0.19,0.49,0,0.78,2.92,3.99,0.97,0.68
f7f8ms,My Sister Attacked Me,"Hi everyone this is a throw away account and I’m still shaken up about the situation so I apologize for terrible format and any misspellings or grammatical errors. 

Yesterday at around 12pm I (21F) was laying on my sisters’ bed (we share a room the three of us since we’re financially tight) watching YouTube videos. I was tired from having had a class early that morning and having slept only four hours the previous night. So my oldest sister comes in (25) and she starts demanding I get out of the room because she has to “make a phone call.” I tell her to go to my parents room since there is no noise coming from the gardeners there and that I’m tired and don’t wanna move. She keeps telling me in her rude tone to fuck off the bed and leave. I ignore her because I don’t want things to escalate and I’m hoping she’ll give up and just leave to my parent’s room. She doesn’t.

She starts taking all the blankets and pretending she gonna make the bed (she NEVER makes it, ever) and she’s pulling them off the bed in a way where they are purposely hitting me while she’s still going off shouting repeatedly to get out. I sit up, irate, and I tell her to remove the blankets from my bed so I can get to it (I sleep on a loft and the blankets were on the ladder). She is yelling profanities at me and repeating to get off and “move!” I’m just waiting for her to remove the blanket. Finally, she does and she starts telling me off and I’m past my limit, so I yell at her that if she had wanted me to go to my bed sooner she should have removed the blankets when I first asked her to and then in my anger I call her a “fucking dumb ass.” She punches me on the head while I start climbing and so I jump off and I turn to her. She tries to swing again but I catch her arm and I’m trying to shove her away now but she goes for my throat and it holding it with her nails digging in and her other hand holding my skinny ass arm. I lean my body weight onto her and we stumble on her bed. She’s not letting go of my throat and she has murder in her eyes, her body shaking with anger. I am fucking terrified. I try punching her but she’s got quite a grip on my throat. 

My parents hear the commotion from the living room and they rush in, my dad ready to beat us with his belt. She finally lets go. I’m shaking catching my breath when they ask us what happened. I try telling them and she says I laid hands on her first. She’s also telling them off and name calling them. My mom just asks me to leave the room. Everyone is angry but no one does anything. I’m crying in the living room and I order a lyft to my boyfriend’s house because I don’t know where else to go. I couldn’t help but feeling that I should’ve called the police but I was scared to “destroy her life” since she aspires to become a teacher and I’m also afraid of being shunned by my family for calling the police on my own sister. I know she has been struggling with depression and anxiety for a while now, but me having bipolar disorder know that mental illness is not an excuse for violence but I doubt my family would understand that. I think something else may be wrong with her in the mental department as her behaviors are largely anti social and she beats her dog. 

Today everyone is acting like this crazy bitch didn’t just try to choke me to death yesterday and I feel abandoned by my parents and sad but also scared and angry. Last night I slept in the living room out of fear with my knife under my pillow. I woke up as soon as she got out of bed and I can’t even look at her.

f7fiyg,Reaching out for support for Nikki Addimando,"[https://westandwithnikki.com/](https://westandwithnikki.com/)

In September 2017, after surviving years of severe and sadistic intimate partner violence, Nicole “Nikki” Addimando shot her partner Christopher Grover in order to save her life. ([For a detailed account of the abuse Nikki suffered, read Rachel Louise Snyder’s article in The New Yorker.)](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/when-can-a-woman-who-kills-her-abuser-claim-self-defense) 

The shooting occurred hours after Child Protective Services opened an investigation against Christopher due to abuse allegations. They had two young children together, ages 2 and 4, who were sleeping at the time. After fleeing the apartment with her children, she sought police assistance. Instead she was charged with manslaughter and murder. 

While Nikki has consistently maintained that her abuser was awake and threatening to kill her (and then himself) at the time she shot him, the Putnam County ADA Chana Krauss claims he was asleep. There is no evidence to support this claim and the People’s own medical examiner conceded that the shooting could have happened exactly as Nikki detailed. 

On April 12, 2019, Nikki was convicted of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon (which was legally registered to her partner).",bgflan,2020-02-21 10:41:25,0,213,89.02,86,3.19,1,23.67,28.17,72.3,39.44,9.39,6.57,0,0,0,6.1,0.47,2.82,6.1,12.21,5.63,1.41,5.16,0.47,8.92,3.76,1.88,1.88,3.29,0,7.98,1.41,6.57,0.47,4.69,0.47,12.21,0,1.41,5.16,1.41,3.29,1.41,0,0.47,0,0.47,0.94,0.47,0.47,0,0,1.88,0.94,0.94,0,0,7.04,1.88,0.47,3.29,0,1.88,4.69,3.29,0.47,14.08,0.47,5.63,7.51,3.29,0,0.47,0.94,0,2.35,1.41,0,1.41,0,0,0,27.7,6.1,4.23,0,0,0,0,5.16,0.94,0.94,4.69,5.63
f7j43h,"Domestic violence in my past, and how it stops me moving on. Anyone else have this? I'm so unhappy and feel like it's going to chase me forever","I broke up with my long term boyfriend 2 years ago. It was extremely abusive. The combination of duration and ordeal meant that I spent a long time trying to manage the damage. It was like a marriage. I feel like I am divorced and I feel like I have this 6 year period of my life where I achieved very little, had no fun, no hobbies and didn't go out and do things that normal people in their 20s/30s do.

Fast forward to last summer. I met a kind, gentle, quiet guy and over-romanticised him. We tried to make a go of things but it ended in December. Why? Well, he had a pretty intense aspergers situation that created so many difficulties. I found myself behaving like an abused, submissive type like I was with my ex in order to prevent new guy becoming too stressed. He found lots of 'normal' things incredibly stressful. I liked the way he didn't bombard me with qs so I could hide most of my ordeal with prior ex. 

Anyway, biology and hormones... I still want to meet and connect with someone. I keep telling myself it's OK to feel like I deserve a loving relationship, friendships and a good career. I don't think I am better than anyone, I just don't think I am worse.. and so, I should also be allowed to have normal, stable things.

I am looking for work at the moment. I live with my mom while I look for work. I am so ashamed of this. My esteem will increase when I am working. But I realised when looking at 'questions to ask on a date' articles that I do not dare ask any of them because I do not want to be asked the same in return. Why? Because I have a gap. I had a period of no joy, no hobbies and no time to do things just for me because I was controlled and coerced. I feel like dating me would be like dating someone who has spent almost a decade in a coma. What the hell do I do? I don't want to scare anyone with the truth.

Am I the only person in the world who has had a period of their life that has meant they couldn't build/grow as much as a person - socially or career wise? I had barely come to terms with my father's suicide when I met my ex. So even my teens/early twenties were about 'overcoming' rather than discovering my life passions. I am so ashamed that I feel so passionless.",Shorse_rider,2020-02-21 14:41:59,14,466,27.32,20.14,90.18,37.14,12.94,13.73,93.99,60.52,20.39,14.38,12.45,0.21,0,0.86,0.86,6.01,5.15,13.09,10.52,6.44,7.51,2.79,19.96,3.65,3.65,2.15,0.64,1.07,6.65,3.65,3,1.07,0.64,0.43,9.23,0.86,1.07,0.21,1.72,12.66,3.43,2.15,1.72,3,0.64,2.36,2.15,0.64,0.21,1.29,1.93,0,1.29,0.43,0,8.15,2.58,1.93,2.15,0.86,1.07,6.01,12.02,0.43,13.09,1.93,4.72,6.87,1.72,0.64,0.21,0.43,0.21,0.21,1.5,0.21,0,0.21,0.21,0.21,15.45,7.08,2.79,0,0,1.07,0,0.43,0,3.43,0,0.64

Back in December my partner attacked me and threw me around. He kicked and hit me and choked me. Left me bruised and really messed up.

I never told my doctors because I didn’t want them snooping around or reporting it. 

I was planning on leaving him before the birth. I’ve been stashing money away and just waiting for the next physical incident to occur.

f7mo5t,My dead foster mother,"Hey,

My mother was sick her whole life and I, together with my twin sister, was an accident. My mother could not care for us, so we were placed in a house. When I was 2 years old, my father died. My foster mother was not married, but she was a the sweetest woman, for sure. I was always pretty violent against my sister.

4 years ago (13 at the time), my foster mother got cancer. My sister and I lived with our neigbours for 6 months and when my foster mother was cured, we moved back with her. 

From that period on, I had lots of fights with her. Before her illness, I had an above average amount of fights with her, but not anything crazy, really. Over the course of 1.5 that really, really changed. Physically I hit her almost everyday. I remember running towards her and kicking her in the leg. I made her bleed and she cried everyday. I called her a cancer hoe and I did sexual things with my sister.

2.5 years ago she got cancer again. This time, it was not able to be cured. She got a kind of bandage on her belly. I was a fucking monster. Me kicking that bandage was not uncommon. It fucking hurts to write this. It really


FUCKING


does.


Man.


Allright. It went better to about the last 2 months. I had my remorses et cetera, I knew it would be over soon. But the last two months I fucking changed. Since then I cried every day. I skipped school (unlike my sister, who was really absent that period) and did a lot of things with her. Everyday I would sing with her, apologize a lot, watch tv shows (some of them religious) and she ... she forgave me. She (when she was the weakest) finished a painting for me, it was a small hobby of hers. Even on her last day, she finished a painting for our neighbor. I was absolutely devestated everyday. After her death, weirdly enough, I just couldn’t cry anymore. I never knew why, but I guess I took the burden before her death, more than after. I didn’t/couldn’t even cry at her funeral. She was a lovely human being. She is the reason I go to a good school and I hope she would be proud of my future goals. I am reallllyyyyyy aspiring to start a family (only 17, but it just seems so beautiful to me. And don’t worry, won’t be a teen father or something), I’m really motivated to go to university, but I feel like I’m forgetting her, and also what I did to her. She is the reason I am motivated to have a wonderful life. She was always grateful, loving, etc and I destroyed her. 

This is the other side of domestic abuse. This is the domestic abuser. The reason I am stable today is because she forgave me then. Man. Fuck.

f7mut0,"Neighbor in a possible abusive situation, looking for advice.","Hi hello. I live in a town home community and I have a dog that I talk for walks fairly often.  While walking there’s one neighbor who I’ve seen get in multiple arguments with a man that I’m assuming is her husband. I’ve seen them get pretty heated but two instances stood out a lot. The first was a few months ago when the man stormed out of the house screaming at her and calling her things I’m not going to make anyone read here. He was screaming in front of the kids and the woman and it seemed more intense than a normal argument. Last night though I was walking past again as they both get out of the car and I couldn’t catch what they were saying but I overheard the man saying “you f****** slapped me” and then crowding the woman as she tried to open the door with him on top of her going “get in the god damn house” over and over”. I couldn’t hear any of the woman’s responses because she stayed quieter once they saw me. Once they got inside I heard a slam on the door three times. Should I do something? Do I call the cops? Do I try to talk to her? I want to try and help but at the same time I’m no one to this woman besides just a nosy twenty something year old with a dog. I’m just looking for advice and opinions because I’m not sure what to do. 

I feel like I should throw this in here so I don’t just sound like an overly nosy neighbor but I’m not sure. So I had a father growing up who was an alcoholic and would get in fights with my mom and they both hated each other and it eventually led to things getting physical one time that I had to break up, so these situations are kind of a trigger for me and I feel like I need to do something.

f7p1ps,My Story,"I was in a relationship for two years.  I knew she had a troubled past but at the time it seemed like she overcame her issues and had her life together.  Long story short after about 6 months things started going downhill.  She became very controlling and emotionally abusive.  Eventually she got physical with me in front of my kids.  I wasn't being a victim any longer - I had left before as well because it wasn't the 1st time she hit me but I ended up going back (I've been away for 6 months now so I've done alot of research about the cycle of abuse and understand what the up and down cycle does to you emotionally as well as biochemically - it really is like an addiction)

So after this last incident I made arrangements to permanently leave - I owed it to myself and my children - this person was toxic and doesn't deserve me.  Well after the incident where I sustained an injury she left the house.  She was gone for two days and during this time I packed as much stuff as I could.  Scheduled a moving company to come in the days to follow.  I get a text from her finally after 2 days saying she wanted to come to the house to grab some clothes.  I left because I didn't want to be around her again and drove to my parents a hour away with everything I packed the preceding two days.

Hours later I get a call from the police department that a protection order was filed against me.  Upon arriving at the station I was arrested after being served.  I was not questioned or interviewed by the police.  They did not try to validate any of her statements yet took her word that I allegedly pushed her and supposedly because off a bruise on her hand said it was enough to establish probable cause.  At the time of the arrest the police would not provide me with any information.  They told me the charge but all details would be provided at the arrangement AFTER I was already arrested.

At this point I've received the police reports and pictures and there is no visual bruise at all.  Yet in her testimony she admits I had a bloody nose but says I got it because i walked into a door.  No BS this is how she explains it away and the police seemed to buy into that explanation.

How is it legal to arrest someone without even getting their side of the story.  How is this due process of law.  Also with the restraining order I wasnt able to get the rest of my things until a court order was obtained.  I had so much furniture and belonging there for myself and children.  She denied my entry several times with a police escort so my attorney filed the motion for the order.

I almost lost my job (I'm a financial professional) because of this allegation yet because of my length of service and after supplying police reports and the details surrounding the flimsy allegation they cleared me to continue working.

So now I'm 7500 in the hole will attorney fees - been pulled into court numerous times at this point - a DV case can take a year.  She has called and emailed me (even with a no contact order that she initiated) 15 times at this point and the DA basically said they didnt care its only illegal if I contact her not the other way around.

I'm completely disgusted that my abuser is continuing to abuse me by using the very system thats supposedly in place to protect me.

f7t3u7,Scared and unsure,"Hi everyone,

I’m not sure I’m posting in the right place but I really had nowhere else to turn. 

I’m scared right now that my fiancé will hurt me and I don’t know what to do about it.

We have been together for nearly 9 months and we got engaged officially just recently. He’s from a different country to me, but we met in his country of origin. I’m working here and we met online through a dating app. 

In the beginning, our major issue was money as he isn’t working right now. I am, and I don’t mind footing the bill if it means we can see each other and actually have a relationship. And that was what I thought I wanted back then. He felt from the beginning, that his role was to contribute something to the relationship but we aren’t talking a fortune here. Just enough to go out on a date or stay somewhere together at the weekend. 

He has a really tumultuous relationship with his family which has resulted in a lot of anger issues. As we got closer, he opened up about how he’d been violent in the past to previous partners. Kicking to the ground, punching, hitting. He told me he hadn’t done it in years. I was really apprehensive when he told me this, but like many before me, I thought he’d changed. 

Before this, I had been close to ending the relationship as he had told me that my false eyelashes were too long, he didn’t like how I smelt, he didn’t like the brand of cigarettes i smoked. He also said that he thought my make up was too strong and maybe people would think badly of me. He said that women here would love to be white, so that doesn’t mean I don’t have to do anything to look good.

I had a fit and he claimed it was just an ‘example’. It happened once more after that, about the same issue.

I knew he had major trust issues from past girlfriends too. I’d told him if he needed to check my phone he could, but somehow he never wanted to. He was quick to complain if I was being ‘secretive’ with it however, like I moved off an IG page too quickly. We regularly stayed at an Airbnb together at weekends, and one day, he asked me if I’d been there without him. I said no, of course not, why? He said he’d noticed some cigarette butts that were the same brand as mine, by the balcony of another room. He thought I had been there with another guy. I had not. It was the first time I had been accused of anything like this and it just didn’t sit well with me throughout. 

However, I didn’t listen to the warnings or pay attention to the red flags. Because fast forward, and our relationship becomes more serious. We decided to move back to my home country together, with me sponsoring his visa. He doesn’t work, and our visa depends on income. I said I would take two jobs to meet the threshold, and I expected he would make an effort to. He did not. He just said that if he took a job as a cab driver for example, it would have to be ‘worth it’, ie he has another job on the side which was ‘better’. He didn’t get any job however. 

This all made me quite worried, I was focused on getting that visa, planning how we would survive etc. I opened up to him about how I had suffered from anxiety in the past, and I told him I was feeling a bit worried now. His response was to turn it into a huge fight, whereby he said I wasn’t able to handle our situation and that he didn’t care about my anxiety anymore. 

So from that point, I shut off. There were other huge rows where he called me a dick, he told me to fuck off. Countless, countless rows. It was so bad that eventually, I just became numb. He told me I was bothering him, I was negative, I was draining him. The whole litany. 

But recently, it escalated. A colleague of mine messaged me asking if we can meet up to discuss some materials for his class. I initially agreed to but then realized that my partner would not like this. We had fought constantly up until this point, so I was exhausted by the fighting and didn’t want to start another. I told my colleague that I was busy in the end and could I call instead. My partner discovered that my colleague had text me and I was so scared about another fight, that I lied to him about the plan to meet (which I changed). In any case, he absolutely terrified me that night. He was calling my phone nonstop, texting me. It was the first time I have ever felt physically threatened. He started to say I was in deep shit, and from his past experience, I shouldn’t try and avoid him. 

He kept badgering me and badgering me, calling me constantly at work. By this time, I was seriously concerned for my safety and I was terrified of what would happen if I told him the truth. 
But eventually, I did tell him the truth. He ended it of course, he said ‘bitch go fuck yourself’ after saying I can go and spread my legs anywhere I want. 
Yet now, he’s been calling me and texting me, seeming to want to work things out but once I answer the phone, he eventually begins to say how this is the worst thing anyone could have done to him, I ruined his life, I wasted his time etc. In his last message, he asked to meet and u said I was feeling intimidated, in case there was another fight and would happen. His response was ‘I can’t guarantee anything because you can’t guarantee shit either’ Im scared, really scared, and I don’t know what to do. I feel like he might hurt me.",JamaicaInn1921,2020-02-22 06:20:45,8,1027,12.3,49.61,52.16,2.8,15.8,15.68,94.35,63.78,25.41,18.89,10.22,1.56,0.29,6.82,0,6.43,4.48,11.78,11.39,6.91,6.91,2.82,21.32,3.8,2.34,1.46,0.68,1.85,5.74,1.56,4.09,1.46,1.56,0.39,16.55,0.1,0.88,0.1,6.91,13.92,2.43,1.85,2.53,3.02,1.07,4.77,2.82,0.49,1.56,0.68,1.46,0.58,0.49,0.29,0.29,8.28,4.48,1.36,0.97,0.78,0.88,11.3,8.28,0.97,13.24,1.36,6.52,6.04,1.85,0.29,0.39,0.88,0,0,1.07,0.68,0.19,0.1,0.1,0,16.55,6.13,5.74,0,0,0.1,0,0,0.58,3.8,0.19,0
f7tomw,Hes moved on... with a cop,"I feel crazy.  I got the strength to leave a relationship that wasn't for me 2 years ago.  He was abusive.  I mean no he didnt punch me or anything like that.  But he did put me in a chokehold a couple of times.  Ironically I still blame myself for those incidents.   
He always said it was because I didnt love him enough.  I wasnt perfect and I could've shown more affection it just never seemed right.
After I left him, he tried to get back with me for a little over a year.  We would go back and forth until last November he just stopped.  No more call or texts.  He called last month to schedule an appt with me ( I own a tax office)  but he scheduled the appt in March.  Which I thought was odd.  But why would he do that.  Does he want to throw his new relationship in my face when he comes in.  Or does he really just want to get his taxes done.  Maybe I'm thinking too much into it.
But now I see hes in a new relationship.   They look happy and shes a cop.  I cant help but to wonder will he do the same with her as he did to me.  It seems like hes changed.  He posts biblical scriptures everyday and looks happy.  Why cant I just be happy for him?

f7ty0n,Anyone else experienced this?,"I was in an abusive relationship for 8 years with my now ex husband (were just starting our divorce) One of the things he controlled was my access to healthcare and dental insurance. Occasionally he’d allow me to go to appointments when it was really necessary ( like when I was pregnant) but often would deny paying for services I needed. He worked and I didn’t and he controlled the finances. He’d spend the money on shoes and things for himself and then tell me we didn’t have money to pay for what I needed done. 

For about four years now I’ve known that I’ve needed a deep cleaning from the dentist and he’d lead me on saying yeah we’ll get it done, we’ll get it done, but it never happened. I think I’m currently on his dental insurance but I’m not sure. We’re still technically married. Anyways he came over last week and showed off his teeth to me. Saying he’d been getting treatments and whitening done and asking me what I thought of them. I didn’t say anything to him but it’s triggered major anxiety in me. I’ve been pulling at my teeth and my hair since we had that conversation. 

I finally had enough and signed up for my own dental insurance this morning. Currently waiting approval but we’ll see. 

I feel dumb that I fell for this trick for so long. I feel gross about myself and have been really beating myself up mentally over it. I see a therapist for support but it’s a slow process. 

I was just curious if anyone else has experienced control like this. This definitely wasn’t the only way he was abusive but it’s one that I can really feel the after shocks of.",littlebitpc11,2020-02-22 07:27:39,0,297,8.24,29.49,86.47,12.41,15.63,16.84,94.61,63.64,26.26,18.18,11.11,2.36,0,4.38,0.34,8.08,3.37,12.46,13.47,6.4,8.08,2.02,24.24,2.02,1.01,1.35,1.35,0,3.7,1.35,2.36,0.34,1.35,0,11.78,1.35,0,0,4.71,15.49,2.69,2.36,1.68,2.02,1.35,6.06,3.7,1.01,1.01,1.01,2.02,1.01,1.01,0.34,0,9.43,3.7,0.67,4.04,1.35,0,9.76,10.44,1.35,13.8,2.02,4.71,7.41,2.02,0,0,3.03,0,0,1.35,0.34,0,0.34,0,0.34,15.15,6.06,0.67,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,6.73,1.35,0

f7xtlw,In an abusive relationship with no one to talk too.,"My wife and I have been married for a little over three years, we have a new kids and on the outside everything looks good. Yet, my wife can flip in a moment. For some backstory, I am a Veteran and i suffer from PTSD, a TBI among other issues. I battle with Suicidal thoughts every day, I find it hard to clean, and get out of bed, but i do these things because i have too. I stay at home and take care of our son, and she works, I get VA payments that make this possible. So, when I first moved in with her I noticed these mood swings, but they were minor and she mostly just got mad for an hour. Yet, as our relationship went on they got worse. Now it is too the point where she is violent, she throws whatever she has in her hand at me, verbally berates me, hits me, and has gone as far as to reach for a knife. To give an example, we moved into a new home. We were putting up dishes when she noticed one of the pans was missing. Moments later she was furious, screaming at me that I had throw the pan away and me trying to tell her it could just be in the stuff we had yet to unpack. The situation escalated, she threw the pan lid from the missing pan at me. Then she proceeded to tell me how much she hated me.  She told me to kill myself, that i was dragging her and my family down. i didnt know what to say, as she yelled in my face, which made her madder. She smacked me in the head, then reached for a knife. i managed to block the knife and push her off me. She left the room and calmed down later, and never said a word about it. When I ask her why, she just says i deserve it.

f83qtu,Need to Tell Someone,"* Trigger warning * 

I’m a 25 year old female who recently was diagnosed with PTSD and can’t accept it at all. I was in a relationship with my ex for 7 years, he was physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially abusive. He tried to kill me on 4 different occasions and caused me to black out from being strangled and attempted to drown me in our pool. He controlled my every move and isolated me from every friend and family member I had. He would tell me how worthless I was constantly, threaten to cheat on me daily, and would actively cheat on me as often as possible. He stole thousands of dollars from me and continues to stalk, harass and threaten me even after leaving over 8 months ago. I feel like I’m living in a nightmare. I thought things would get better but they haven’t. I have nightmares almost every single night about him trying to kill me and no one being able to help me. I can still remember every punch and kick he inflicted on me. I can still remember when he forced me to have sex with him as I cried for him to stop. I find it impossibly hard to be happy and don’t know how I can continue to live in such fear of him coming back to finish me off. Just wanted to get this off of my chest since I have told absolutely no one. I feel so fucking alone.

Relationship

PLEASE READ I KNOW ITS LONG I NEED A EAR TO LISTEN THIS IS MY LAST RESORT


So me and my ex knew each other since hs. I meet him through a friend we all three became best friends. Me and him started dating but before our relationship he told the whole entire school that his mom passed away, but not only that he made up a whole story of how she passed away he said in an house fire along with his cat. He keep this going one day I went into his fb I seen a profile with a lady who looks just like him, and him in the picture. Come to find out it was his mother I contacted him and ask him about it he quickly hurried of the phone called her to tell her to block us but I got in contact with her, and she confirmed she was his mom. I was furious because he had been staying at my house for months we grew so close. I understood the situation because she wasn’t in his life, but the fact that he keep the lie going to everyone in the school. One night with him being at my house he stated to me that he seen his mother ghost in my house and started crying. After that situation I told the mutual friend about it we confronted him he blocked both of us and stop speaking to us. He didn’t give us  an explanation we graduated but he didn’t and we end up not talking to him for three months. He just walked out my life after us hanging out everyday and him sleeping over ..,.

       Fast forward I was so sad the whole summer I didn’t even want to go out I felt he abandoned me when we grew a connection I was so sad then one day my cousin just contacted him he finally responded apologized to us both and he came back in my life. We ended up making it official he basically lived with me at the age of us being 17, because his father and him did not get along his dad was abusive and a dead beat. His mom spoke to him every couple of months but haven’t seen him in years and she lives 30 min away she is not on drugs or nothing it seems like she has her own life and kids somewhere else. When dating me and the third friend who was our bf had an incident he use to choose her over me with certain situations. I had a guy bf who I knew since middle school we never did anything together  I think he might be on the other side but when I told my best friend he texted me a heart to be petty and we were joking around about it ( he knew my best friend I made them meet he thought he was gay). My boy friend seen it he was pissed he end up taking me to a park down the block from my house and beat me up this is the first time I been through that also my father was sick dying or cancer at the time 

      I ended up telling the friend who was both of our mutual friend what was going on even though me and her was not in a good place because I kind of trusted her she knew both of us . She ended up asking him about it months later when me and her had a falling out  like he was going to admit to what he did. Her mom got into it and was accusing me of I guess lying about it, because I was still with  him after that. I had plenty of episodes of his abuse, she even witnessed one. Some things he did to me was one day I took too long to get dressed I was taking him out for his birthday she was their he slapped me in my face then apologized. He said he was having troubles with his past and that brought up memories of his parents. He broke up a time with me because our mutual friend said to choose between me or her but the breakup he did was not regular he had sexual intercourse with me then when I was waking up the next day to go to work he broke up with me dragged me out his house spit on me., and started beating me in his hallway. One time he beat me so much I thought I was going to die. I stayed with him for 5 years through all of this he spoke about my dead father, past situations that happen to me when I was a kid that I open up to him about. He beat me in-front his family members called me out my name in front of them. It was to a point of time he was not allowed at my house so I started going to his his father would hear me screaming and would just ignore it and turn his music up.

     Not to mention he was not working or going to school the whole 5 years I had to support the both of us I got nothing for my birthday Christmas our anniversary. The only time he ever bought me stuff was when he got a law suit when he turned 18. He got 35,000 he bought me an iPhone shoes and clothes and other stuff my mother would ask him for money sometimes because he was staying at my house for free I would stop her. One time we had a big argument he asked me for the stuff he brought me back I returned everything he ever bout in total on me and my mom he probably spent 5,000 on us and blew the rest in a couple of months. I know throughout the whole relationship I spent over 5,000 on him. After his money blew out and I was in college working and going to school he would get mad when I had money I would always give him but he felt that I owed him more because he claimed to have given me 30k when he blew it on himself and his friends. He would steal out my bank account every argument we had he would bring this money up


  He did so much stuff the list goes on but I’m not going to write all of that. Now I’m going to talk about the last two breakups we had over the course of 5 years every breakup we had has been by him about stuff like me not saying the right thing or me talking to someone he didn’t like. Or just for any reason. I would beg for him back because I loved him. I got attached to him he was their for me when my father died of cancer. I felt I put a lot of effort into this relationship. Pushing him to get his ged and finish school. I felt I couldn’t live without him he knew that he would sometimes say to be with him I would have to give him stuff and I did it. People around me was looking at me like I’m dumb because people started to find out what he was doing. I can’t explain it I just keep going back no matter what. He loved when I begged him and I did. He made me feel like no one else wanted me he told me that. After my dad died he was the only man I knew and trusted I just couldn’t give up on this. I started to get abandonment issues because of him. He made me feel like I wouldn’t have anyone else because he knew my situation. He always party every time we broke up.

   He use to ghost me the second to last breakup he left for a week over an petty argument I had to contact his uncle to ask him for him to call me. He made it seem like we was going to work stuff out then later that day he called back and just said we are done he doesn’t love me or want me anymore and to not contact him. I just said ok I was crying a lot but instead this time I left him alone changed my number deleted my fb.  I guess he didn’t expect it. I cried for days couldn’t eat sleep or nothing everyone thought I was going to kill myself, but I didn’t I fought through it. A month later I was at work I got a phone call it was him I keep hanging up he keep calling he said he was calling to check on me then he ended up crying on the phone for us to get back together I caved in. We both said we were going to work on stuff I did stuff in the relationship not cheating or anything small stuff like lying or if I spoke to someone he didn’t like females or tell them what was going on. We had minor issues he would put his hands on me but not as bad as before. He would still take my money without my permission. Everytime we broke up it was always a random female friend who popped up and confessed that they loved him or something. I was insecure he knew that only because at the beginning he was sleeping with many girls and just ghosting them before we started going out 

 The last breakup happen because we had an argument not serious ( December 2019) he went 2 days without talking to me. I was just upset because this was a normal thing he would always do just leave or stop talking to me for days to weeks when he didn’t feel like being bothered. Or if I would talk to him about things that he didn’t like. At this point I was just angry feed up I could admit. He works off a WiFi phone he called me and said go to his house then the phone got cut off his father let me in I waited in his room for 5 min I keep calling him he never answered. I never did this before but I hide his ps4 and took his laptop and left. I did not want it I did it because I was upset and that’s the only things he care about. I didn’t need nor want it I have three laptops, and I was also financially supporting him. 10 min into me walking to my house he called me I feel like he was at his house or around the area begging for me to come back and talk I was too upset and I felt like he was only calling for his stuff. He ended up coming to my house banging the door I wasn’t home I was outside clearing my head.  He claimed he was at a job that he supposedly got that day he wanted to surprise me it was located 2 hrs away from him. I knew he was lying he said he was going to show me proof of the job but never did. I know him he never made an attempt to work, and he wouldn’t travel that far. Me and his father had conversation his father confirmed that most likely he didn’t go he has lied in the past to his father about having a job when he was at his friend house smoking for days

   Over the past couple of days he tried to get me to meet up I was upset and refused, because I knew if it wasn’t for me having the stuff he wouldn’t even contact me. One day he came to my house after I told him not too acted like he was coming to talk by time he left I thought he was going to change. He left with my iPad and my Louis Vuitton scarf. After a couple of weeks we talked on and off he said that I had to work for him because what I did I admit I got my mom involved she seen how upset I was and they got into it I felt so bad he wanted me to come over I went spent three days over their. It was fun. We both agreed we were working on the relationship. When I got home we had a little argument nothing big really. He ghosted next I feel like he used these opportunities to ignore me and now thinking about it he was most likely talking to other girls or the girl best friend that we had in common that we both agreed not to speak too behind my back. We had sex when I was over their, so since he just disappeared it made me feel worse. I spent days calling him when he answered I would come on the phone yelling because you are ignoring me for days at a time for an minor argument I would call and call and call because he never said stuff was done and I already felt dumb because I had sex with him. Then when I called back it would take another two days for him to answer he would whisper and act like he was at a job we all knew he didn’t have he told me previous the job was done even though he never had it to begin with. Then when I would start yelling he hung up and made me seem like I was the problem like I didn’t have a right to be mad so after that I just keep repeatedly calling asking for my stuff back and he could have his. He finally answered and said he’s not giving me my stuff that’s at his house I will have to show a receipt to get it back it’s his. I told him since we are done just give me my stuff it doesn’t make sense to keep it if we are really done this time. I keep calling him he said he was bringing my stuff to my house then when I called him back he told me come to his house I refused because he was either going to hit me, and if something happened to me I know he would lie and say I came to his house to start problems. I told him I would have my cousin come and drop the stuff he said no. I called him again because I have no use of his laptop I never wanted it I have 3. And I don’t know his pw for his devices but he knew mines I just wanted my stuff back. He said to me stop calling him I’m a crazy bitch he don’t want me anymore and I’m lying about everything abusive he has done to me in the relationship. Days past I felt bad stupid I opened my legs to him again I was attached I felt like no one else wants me I felt lonely because he was the only person I would be around all the time. He just answered and repeated the same thing I asked him why would you invite me to your house have sex with me and make me use my money thinking you are going to change he said I was lying and I was being a bitter lying bitch because he didn’t want me leave him alone he is moving on I ruined his life.


   Now he is trying to make me look crazy infront of everyone I know that he most likely still talking to our girl ex best friend the girl that made him cut me off and thought I was lying about everything. I seen his uncle wrote something on Facebook about toxic people his mom liked the comment which she never does. So I know most likely he told them lies about me. His uncle doesn’t live in his  house anymore but I know he has an idea about some stuff, and it’s just like no matter what bad this guy does they are behind him. As far as his mother she lives 30 min away hasn’t seen him in 4-6 years she has a whole new life with a bf and I feel like kids that she’s hiding from him. I know he is either lying to them about how we broke up or why. He is trying to make me seem toxic and crazy to everyone, and I know if I go on Facebook and write the truth I have proof of him stealing money and marks from his abuse. They would think I’m doing that because I’m bitter or it would further prove his false accusations of me being crazy. His father and his father girlfriend knows the truth they heard what went on in his room they ignored it they didn’t give a shit if I died they would just turn the music up. I shouldn’t expect them too because I put myself in that situation and I keep going back to him. That was the biggest question why did I keep going back. I loved him that’s the only man I knew since my father died when my father was in the hospital on his dying bed with cancer he stuck by my side. I felt that without him I wouldn’t have made it through that without him. After that he just made me feel like I was the ugliest thing on earth he told me no one else will want me, and I would be alone he’s the only person I had. I don’t even want to get him in trouble or embarrass him by telling my side of the story I know everyone he tells the story too is going to  think I’m just a psycho liar and if I explain it they will just ask that one question why didn’t you leave? I don’t know how to heal he knows how to hurt me and I feel like he did not want to give me my stuff because he felt like that was a way to make me keep contacting him while he keeps trying to make me look crazy I just have no choice but to leave it alone like I did the last time and when I did that he called me crying saying why didn’t I fight for him back, but why would I keep calling someone who told me leave them alone, calling me a crazy bitch infront of people so I can prove his point. I HAVE A LAPTOP HE HAS A BED I BOUGHT A FLATSCREEN MY IPAD MY LOUIS VUITTON SCARF AND MORE. I told him I can have someone drop his stuff he said no.

I JUST FEEL HURT AND LOST I CHANGED MY NUMBER AND JUST DELETED ALL MY SOCIAL MEDIA. THIS TRIGGERED THE ABANDONMENT ISSUES HE GAVE ME. He knows he’s won he always told me no one will ever believe me, and now I have these thoughts in my head what if he treats another girl better than me, or if he changes and get a job and finish school like I always pushed him to do. That’s all I  wanted our girl bf at the time seen how much I did for him. I always made sure he ate everyday when his own mother didn’t even do that or even our girl bf he said I ruined his life when all I been trying to do is help and push him to do good because no one else in his life including his parents was not. I know him  the real him he has cried to me about everything he went through as a child and stuff that happen to him as he was older. Everyone that doesn’t know the truth is looking at me like I’m toxic but doesn’t know what I been through. The only people that are toxic in his life are his parents his father supplies him with weed 24/7 and is encouraging his lazy habits of him not wanting to do nothing with his self and his mother is just not around. His father had drugs in his house which got their house raided and he got arrested because of his dad but I’m toxic when all we argued about mostly is me trying to help him get a job and get his ged and him lying about going to the appointments. Guess what if he actually does get his stuff together now that I’m out the picture that’s going to prove his uncle point and other people he is most likely lying too point that I am the toxic thing when they had no idea what I went through. Knowing him he doesn’t even want to work or do anything with himself but not that I’m out the picture he would do that just to hurt me

f870mq,PLEASE HELP ME,"I (M22) was in a controlling, emotionally, physically abusive relationship for almost three years.

I am unsure on how to process this stuff and need words of advice. I always felt it was my fault, as she (F21) would never apologise for anything that went wrong, it was always me. I would try and walk away but she would threaten to kill herself if I did. She would spit and attack me, and when I called her out on it, she would simply make an excuse to say it was justified. She would say things like ""Everyone says you are hitting above your weight with me"", so I would believe I would never get anyone as attractive or as ""loving"" as her. She would control what I wore and where we would go out too.

Three weeks ago I walked away, but the emotional abuse that made me dependant, made me crawl back.  The day before the breakup she begged and pleaded that I did not leave her (she was attacking me and being verbally abusive to me during the night). Then when I did it, her attitude changed to ""Thanks for the memories"". I asked her three times to talk but she would tell me she was done and didn't want it anymore.

I don't understand it. How can she go from hot to cold so quickly? Is this mental torture? A friend told me she was out last night and seemed happy. I am tired of feeling like my emotions have been messed up so badly. I have alot of family and friends who always told me they didn't like her angry attitude towards things.

He said something like ""oh if you're into that how come you claim to be a victim. "" Then he says oh just joking. It's not just that though. since I've moved in he's made constant advances towards me including asking me to sleep with him and commenting on my body constantly. I already told the landlord about it and she spoke to him so it was meant to have stopped. He also held his phone up to me showing me a picture of him nude. I didn't want to see the at all.

f89rpk,I wish it could have been different,"I left the father of my children in April 2018, when my kids were barely 1 and nearly 6. I knew I had to leave, things were only escalating and more and more was happening in front of the children. 
It was a rough year and a half at first, he was nasty to me and did his best to destroy me financially by dragging out a custody case using attorneys, he manipulated me through the children. He regularly threatened me and did a lot of things to try to keep control over me through intimidation and fear. 
But the past few months he’s been kinder and better. It’s been nice but of course I don’t trust it. 
Then, last night, he had me leave the children with him for a couple of hours and then asked me to have everyone together for dinner to celebrate my birthday. He helped them make cupcakes, get me a gift, make cards, and then bought pizza. 
It was so nice, all of it. He was nice to me and to all of us. It was this perfect little evening with our family together like it should have been. It was really hard for us to have to leave and go to separate houses. 
My children were sad, I was sad, it was all just so hard to see exactly what it could have been, should be. My heart breaks for my children that they can’t have what they deserve because I left. 
I know I can’t go back, it wouldn’t take long for things to end up right back in the same abusive cycle. He hasn’t changed really, he’s just feeling comfortable in life and like always, when he’s feeling good he’s good to everyone.

f8hmhv,Sisters's BF got violent when she tried to break up with him. She's giving him a second chance,"Apparently they got into an argument over his internet history and things spiralled out of control from there.

She tried to break up with him and he got violent - physically restraining her, throwing her onto furniture and not letting her leave.

Eventually he left or she called her apartment building security.  And she blocked him on all social media for a few days.

She spoke to her friends about what to do, apparently they ""like him"" so suggested giving him another chance. 

They've been back together for 3-4 weeks and things seem great between them so far.

I'm concerned for her because by her own admission she has a history of ""crazy ex boyfriends"" and honestly she knows how to wrap men around her little finger, and get them infatuated

They've been living together for two months and dating prior about six.  If this guy was this distraught at the potential break-up that he lashed out this early in the relationship then I worry about his next reaction.

She isn't exactly emotionally stable (bipolar diagnosis) and has on several occasions gone out of her way to emotionally hurt men she's in a relationship with.  

She moved overseas at a young age so it's not like I can confront this guy.

I've told her that if she needs to break up with him for real to not do it alone but to have friends there.  It's almost like they're back in that initial honeymoon period.

f8k573,Nobody cares about domestic violence.,"I left my abusive partner in September. I went to the police with text messages wherein he admitted to making me bleed and more generally hurting me when we had sex, where he criticized my bad attitude over having a rock thrown at me, I had bruises on my thighs, texts where he admitted to raping other women, texts of him apologizing the night after he raped me for ""hurting"" me, screenshots of him logging into my social media, texts where he told me he changed the locks because I went to my mother's house when he was screaming at me.

The police never investigated. They forwarded the materials to the DA without any additional investigation and the DA decided, a couple days before Christmas, not to press charges but warned me that he might being criminal charges against me for harrassment because I published all these abusive texts online and tagged his friends, family, and coworkers.

I have a domestic violence restraining order that's been continued to May because of his legal maneuvering, and my mother told me I was being selfish to ask my brother to come to court because such a traumatic experience would trigger his anxiety. She told me I need to get ot together because I'm sucking all the air out of any room I walk into. Back in April, Easter morning, he was angry at me because he came into the bedroom and I was looking at my phone. He started screaming at me and she went into the guest room and closed the door.

f8ku6c,Witnessed DV/Sexual assault from 5-12 now much older. Therapy? Medication?,"Just read that when you have PTSD as a child you lack up regulation  of serotonin 1B and have classic symptoms with minimal help from therapy or medication. 

I’ve done EMDR and IFS with little help - romantic relationships cause so much stress I become chronically inflamed and have insomnia constipation random impending doom/anxiety attacks without precipitating thoughts. 

Two years ago I was stalked and threatened and so much trauma and unsafety came up I went back to therapy and have had a dozen panic attacks since then. 

After a recent breakup I’m lost and helpless. Life goes on. I’m stuck in the past subconsciously so I don’t realize it. Friends move away, get married , have kids and I feel lost isolate like when I was a kid and didn’t know if mom would live or die. 

There’s no purpose in living unless this is resolvable. 

I’m atheist or agnostic.

f8zid6,"I just ran away from home. This is going to wreck my mom emotionally, I feel guilty, but I wasn’t safe","When I got financial independence, my parents started acting strange. They barged into my room once, and when I told them to get out, threatened to call the police. I didn’t want to go home with them once. They called the police and ambulance, and tried to take me to a psychiatrist because I’m “sick”. 

My mom started sobbing, saying that I was making her sad. 

Heavily implied, she doesn’t want to divorce my dad and wants me there as emotional support. But this isn’t my responsibility, and I’m not even safe at home. 

I was living with a family friend, but she sensed something weird was happening with my family, didn’t want to get involved, and told me to have my parents send me home. 

I didn’t want to ask them to do anything for me, especially because I knew this would wreck my mom. But had to out of consideration for the family friend. 

When I got home, they made me feel unsafe. I was treated like a doll for whatever emotional needs they have. I felt unsafe with my dad being able to do whatever he wanted at any moment. 

I wanted to escape today, but I felt really, really guilty knowing how sad this would make my mom. My mom must’ve sensed it, because she stayed home from work. She kept asking me if I’m sick, if I need to see a doctor. I thought about staying for longer so she wouldn’t feel so sad. But I didn’t feel safe. When she went for a walk, I ran out and got a hotel. 

I packed a big suitcase to prepare for this moment, with my passport and personal information, but didn’t want to waste any time incase my mom got back, so I took my backpack, which has a phone and laptop, and left. 

I only have a little bit in savings. I’m at a hotel now. I feel guilty that this is going to depress the shit out of my mom. I don’t know how she’s going to live with this. But I’m not safe there. 

They might try to call the police on me, track my location, try to accuse me of being sick, take me to a doctor, I don’t even know. 

I don’t know how I’ll survive. My social skills are terrible because I wasn’t raised with any. I’ve never independently held a job or lived independently before. And I just ran away from home with barely anything. Just some savings and a phone and laptop. 

My parents are going to ask where I am when they get home. Do I even tell them? I don’t want to talk to them ever again. And I feel so, so sorry for my mom.

f9188b,sexual abuse in marriage,Just trying to make sense of things. I think I am experiencing sexual abuse sometimes but it doesnt feel so cut and dry. Sometimes when my husband and I have sex and I'll tell him something is hurting me he'll ask if I want to stop and will stop if I say I want to. Other times if I'm hurting and ask him to stop he wont and will say he's almost done and will cover my mouth and hold me down until he's done. The times he doesnt cover my mouth he just ignores me telling him to stop and idk it just makes me feel weak because there's nothing I can do. He's never angry afterwards he's always really loving immediately after and sweet and gentle so it makes things confusing. I dont understand why sometimes he respects what I want but other times he doesn't. He also is not abusive in any other way outside of sex I don't think so its hard to reconcile that he could be abusive.,throwawaayyy0990,2020-02-24 16:24:56,3,177,1,18.3,53.13,1,19.67,12.43,98.31,63.84,25.99,19.21,11.3,0,0,7.91,0,6.78,0.56,7.91,14.69,7.91,12.99,5.65,25.42,3.95,0.56,1.69,0,0.56,7.91,1.69,6.21,0.56,2.82,1.13,13.56,1.13,0,0,9.04,20.9,3.95,2.82,3.95,6.21,1.69,5.65,6.21,0,1.13,3.39,4.52,1.13,0.56,2.26,0.56,6.78,2.26,0.56,1.69,0,2.26,1.13,19.77,3.39,12.43,0,2.82,9.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.56,0,0.56,0,0,0.56,10.17,4.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.65,0,0
f92w3c,I think I'm at the end of an abusive relationship. Here's a list of everything that hurts.,"Four dark yellowing marks on my right forearm

A sore sternum

A cut on my right middle finger from your teeth

And a bruised joint on my hand to accompany it

A right arm that won’t straighten all the way without cracking the elbow

Cuts on my palms and knees from cleaning up the broken glass in the airbnb

A right index finger that still won’t bend or extend, since last November

“I’m so sorry” written on the whiteboard we use to say I love you

Panic attacks that come and go throughout the day

Sharp memory of the pain and realization that flashed across your face when I told you that you were about to break my arm

Two videos on my phone where your voice doesn’t sound like you

The echoes of “you deserve to be hit” repeated over and over

My heart racing every time I hear the apartment building door close

My heart breaking every time I realize it's not you

A crushing feeling of isolation

The uncertainty of you leaving our apartment in the middle of the night with half of your belongings

Paired with creeping acceptance that there’s no coming back from this",ughmeekus,2020-02-24 18:21:38,9,216,84.94,66.17,93.5,1.2,72,15.74,89.81,53.24,18.06,12.96,6.94,0.93,5.09,0,0,5.09,9.72,16.2,4.17,3.7,3.7,2.78,11.11,2.31,1.39,0.93,1.39,1.39,5.09,0.93,4.17,0.93,0.93,1.39,9.26,0,0,0,0,7.41,2.78,0.93,0,0.93,1.85,1.39,6.48,0.93,2.31,3.24,7.41,6.02,0.93,0,0,5.09,2.78,0,2.31,0,0,1.39,6.48,1.39,18.98,1.85,11.57,5.56,0.46,0.46,1.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.94,0.93,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,1.85,3.7,0,0
f94eaa,I’m only 20 and can’t stop thinking about the physical abuse,"I’ve been with my abuser for around 4 years. I feel so stupid for letting him physically abuse me, and always going back to him. I was very suicidal at the time and didn’t care about my body at all... he hasn’t hit me for a year but can’t stop thinking about it all. 

I’m only 20 and have had bulging discs in my neck for 2-3 years and probably have had concussions. I have neck and back pain every day from him punching my head and back and throwing me on the ground. 

It really sucks bc I tried to tell doctors I had a neck injury when I first got it, but they told me it was “in my head” as I hadn’t told them about the abuse. Despite having the pain for years I only got an MRI the past summer and have been going to PT but it’s still there and a constant reminder of him. 

I don’t live with him anymore but we still see each other a lot. I’m so lonely and I’m isolated to the point where I need to talk to him or I feel crazy from being so alone. I can’t stop replaying the abuse and don’t know what to do. 

Being in college is so isolating with a past like this, I feel like no one can understand and I can never really tell anyone how bad it truly was. 

I’ve been seeing a therapist for a while but it doesn’t help much. Psychedelics haven’t helped much (other than making me care about my body more)..

f97x4w,"eff him, right?","This is going to be long and I already know the answer but I need to hear it from someone else.  

I met my fiancé when I was 16. I’m 43 now. He became extremely abusive about 6 months after we met and maybe 3 months after we became exclusive. I stayed with him because I was young and naïve and I honestly had no idea how to escape. He went to prison when I was 17 and pregnant with our first child. I stayed with him for that time and left when he got out and exhibited the same behavior. I had moved out of state while he was incarcerated so it was easy to just sneak out and head back to my momma’s house to get away. I moved back a year or so after he was released and allowed him to come see our son. During one of these visits, he raped me and I became pregnant with our second son. He’s been in and out of prison since then and our second son really has no memory of ever being around him because I kept him away. Our oldest doesn’t really care if he’s around or not, he never has. But, the youngest has always wanted him to be around and wondered about him. So, when he was released after a 7 year bid in 2018, he reached out to him. He came to our house to see him and he was so different. He was so kind and caring. It was like all the bad parts of him had been removed and all that remained was the good. He was perfect. We rekindled our relationship and were completely inseparable. What I didn’t know at that time was that he had a raging drug addiction before he went to prison and had started occasionally using again. He violated his probation and was sent back to prison for 9 months. I waited for him because I’m a recovering addict so I get that part. Relapses happen, it’s part of recovery for most. When he was released, he was the same person I fell in love with. Still kind and caring. He still acted like I hung the moon. But, exactly one week after he was released, he violated probation again and went back for 3 months. Again, I stayed with him. Then, he was released and had served his full sentence so there was no probation. He was ok for the first few weeks but then he changed. He was obviously using again. I tried to help him get clean and hoped for the best. It got progressively worse. He became a fucking demon. In one month, I had 2 black eyes, a busted lip, too many bruises to count, and damage to my knee and thumb that haven’t healed after about 6 weeks. I think I may also have some kind of damage to my scalp from having my hair pulled so much because I can’t really feel it when I scratch my head. I’m not sure if that’s a thing so if anyone has any input on that I’d really appreciate it. The worst part of the abuse is the things he would make me do, though. When he would get high, he would make me go with him to the drug infested areas and the people he was hanging out with and make me perform sexual acts on them. This happened twice. Keep in mind, these people are basically homeless due to their crack addiction so they smelled terrible and I actually threw up. It was horrible but I was terrified so I did as I was told. I want to clarify something here. I wasn’t afraid of getting beat. I could take that. I was afraid our youngest son would see that he’d beat me and kill him. Our youngest exhibits the same violent behavior as him and he completely adores me.  And, I couldn’t bear that. I'll do whatever I can or take whatever I need to in order to save my sons. Three weeks ago, he came home high as balls and made me go with him. As soon as I saw him I burst into tears because I didn’t want to have to do anything with anyone just so he could continue to get high. He didn’t make me do anything with anyone else but I was forced to perform oral sex on him for HOURS.  When he finally felt like I’d had enough (only because I faked an injury), he found a prostitute and had her continue. I was there and had to watch this. This added a whole new level to the abuse because I've been a victim of sexual assault before him so I wanted to help her but I also wanted to escape and was torn between helping her and getting the fuck away. I’m ashamed to admit I chose to escape. I’ll probably always feel guilty about that. When I got home, I realized he had my keys and while I was trying to figure out who to call, he showed up. He gave me the keys to get in and I locked the doors behind me so he couldn’t get in. Eventually, he agreed that if I’d let him in to shower and get his stuff he would leave. I had been up for over 24 hours at this point and knew he’d done all of the drugs a few hours earlier so I believed him. I made him come in through the front door while I left out the back door so he couldn’t get to me. He didn’t leave, though. He just stayed until he wore me down and I needed to go to sleep. I did sleep in my car for a few hours but by this point I’d been awake for over 36 hours. So, I parked outside our house and asked him to let my dog out because she hadn’t been out for about 15 hours (this is a guess) and she hadn’t been fed. He came out with the dog, crying and apologizing for everything. I was so exhausted I accepted this and went in the house to sleep. I’ve been clean from heroin for about 7 years but as soon as I woke up I started reaching out to people I used to use with. Within an hour, I had someone who could get me dope and I left while he was asleep. Heroin was my very best friend for so many years so of course I ran back to it. I came back to the house to do it because I knew the risks of using after being clean for so long. I knew I did too much but didn’t care because who in the fuck would want to live like this???? I made it to the bed and once I sat down, I just fell over on him. I had seizures strong enough that I ended up chipping my tooth and pissing myself for hours. According to him, this went on for 4 hours while he was trying to wake me up. Obviously, I could’ve died. But, I literally gave no fucks at that point. When I woke up, he was holding me and crying. He swore he would never use drugs again, would give me his debit card so he had no access to any money and would do whatever I needed him to do to know he was serious. He said my overdose was a wakeup call and he couldn’t stand the thought of losing me and would do anything it took to make me ok. I agreed to give him one last chance with very specific conditions. I gave him a clean slate. He was following all of my conditions and going above and beyond to make sure I knew he was serious. Then he was arrested for something that happened a month and a half ago. They’re wanting to give him life in prison based on his record. I knew the charges and pretty much knew he was guilty but tonight I received a copy of the police report and I KNOW he’s guilty. There’s no question to me. He 100% did this. He pulled up beside a prostitute, pulled out a gun, and made her get in the car. Him and the people he had with him robbed her and told her she was going with them. They stopped at a gas station and he reached back and rubbed on her and said “She’s thick so she’ll do” They told her where they were going and when they got there she managed to escape while he was taking a hit from a fucking crack pipe. The only thing I’m thankful for is that this woman was able to escape. Obviously, I don’t know her but I can't even imagine what she would’ve been subjected to if she hadn’t gotten away. I’m disgusted as fuck. But, I now realize when he’s high women are simply a means to an end to him. He’s amazing when he’s not high, though. He's everything I ever wanted him to be and more. He's so fucking sweet and attentive. I fell in love with him when I was 16 (27 years ago), I’ve been in several relationships since then, even agreed to marry a few, but I've never loved anyone even close to how much I love him. I’m heartbroken because I know he did this and I'm embarrassed as fuck because he did it. When I read the police report, the only thing I could think of was how thankful I was this woman was able to escape because I don’t want anyone to have to endure the shit I have. But, I'm also thankful that it wasn’t me. And that also makes me feel like shit.  

I know he’s counting on my addiction experience to pop up and make me be ok with this because I know we do a lot of shit we wouldn’t normally do while using. I’m so fucking heartbroken right now. After 27 years and 2 kids, I'm so entangled with his family. I don’t even know how to separate myself. And, I'm fucking devasted that someone I love so much could be such an evil piece of shit. I see the difference between clean him and using him and it’s so fucking hard to reconcile the two.  

I guess I just need someone to cosign me cutting it all off. I told him I was giving him one last chance after I od’d and he did everything I asked after that. This happened before but I just found out. My heart is just broken as fuck and I need someone to make me feel better right now. But, I gave him that one last chance to make shit right and that’s what he’s holding onto.  

Tell me I’m justified in saying I don’t give a fuck what I agreed to before I knew what he did. I love him when he’s clean but I want him to die when he’s using. I actually prayed that he would go to prison the last time because I couldn’t take that shit anymore. I'm not sad he’s going to go to prison. I’m sad because the person I thought existed doesn’t really exist and I've spent all this time on him.",missestill,2020-02-25 01:44:56,6,1912,12.31,43.97,44.63,13.68,15.8,10.2,94.14,64.02,23.95,18.99,9.78,0.78,0,8,0.42,4.97,3.77,13.6,11.19,7.01,10.41,1.99,22.54,4.86,2.41,1.73,1.88,1.57,5.39,2.25,3.14,0.52,1.57,0.42,13.44,0.52,0.05,1.1,7.37,13.39,2.56,2.62,2.46,2.3,1.41,2.93,1.31,0.47,0.21,0.47,3.35,1.15,0.84,1.1,0.1,6.64,1.62,0.78,2.56,1.57,0.63,10.51,9.31,0.99,15.38,2.77,6.01,7.22,0.47,0.1,0.68,0.16,0.1,0.16,1.26,1.05,0.05,0.16,0,0,13.55,6.22,2.51,0,0,0.26,0,0,0.1,4.08,0.31,0.05

f9app0,Why I Didn’t Report,"First post, I have no where else to go with this. I am 32/F/Married with a stepchild who does not live with us. 

Things have always been complicated between my husband and I but more so after we got married (crazy, jealous bio mom, financial mismanagement, little effort and failing hygiene on his part and for me, “mild to moderate” military related PTSD which is apparently the cause of all of our problems despite it being well managed. He also likes to diagnose me with mental problems that I don’t have even though I am a professional with a good job, and otherwise have my shit together) but three months ago, after a nice night out with friends he attacked me. He was drunk, so much that he claims to not remember anything. 

It started with him being asked to leave the bar. He started trying to piss on a car parked on The side of the street as we walked. A security guard came out and started yelling at him as I was trying to lead him away And a little further down the street, he began urinating on me as I walked, laughing, calling me a “fucking bitch.” Some friends had walked ahead and were out of sight, but my best friend and I continued walking to the parking garage with my husband. Once we were down on the very bottom floor, he turned around, looked me right in the eyes and said “fuck you you fucking bitch. Fucking cunt.” And punched Me in the right temple. He continue punching me All over my head, at least a dozen times but not in the face. He dragged me down to the ground by my hair and pulled my hair back so far that I thought my neck was going to snap. I truly thought that I was going to die. He punched me in the chest at least four times And then punched me in the lower abdomen as well. I was trying to maintain my composure through all this and tried to tell him that he was hurting me and to stop, but every now and then he would look in my eyes and say “fuck you, fuck you.” My friend intervened and gently restrained him. I got up and my friend told me to run And call the police. My husband was then spitting at me, reached out and ripped my skirt, and called me a “fucking bitch.” Problem was, there was no reception so I would have to leave the area. I, under no circumstances, wanted to leave my friend alone with my husband. My friend had terribly overestimated his abilities and had His shirt ripped off, put in a headlock, and then punched repeatedly in the face when I realized that if I did not intervene he would be seriously injured also. I was able to help my friend get free and we both went up to the top of the garage to call for help. Plenty of witnesses, some crying. As I stood there At the opening of the garage waiting for my friend to return, I ran my fingers through my hair and huge clumps fell out. It was at that point I realized I was covered in bleeding abrasions. 

A couple things went through my mind. If he gets arrested, so do I. I work in a field where there is zero tolerance for even the perception of stepping out of line. Any contact with police could cost me my job. It is truly zero tolerance. Legal fees that I would have to pay for I’m sure, my house that I would lose. Maybe, even mugshots plastered across the Internet. I could lose literally fucking everything by having this happen to me, something I never saw coming. I went and got him out of there. 

I’ve caught a lot of shit for what I did, Mainly because it decreases credibility in the eyes of the law but if police intervened I’d have been living in a box this winter.

When I woke up in the AM, my hand was swollen like a baseball, I had scratches and bruises all over my body. 

He has asked me to tell him what happened dozens of times, but believes that because there was alcohol involved he can’t truly be held accountable for that. He resents how incredibly fucking traumatizing this was for me and while initially apologetic, now tells people a wildly different story (he got in a fight with my male friend and I tried to be a hero and got knocked down, etc.) while saying that he doesn’t remember and can’t blindly take my word for what happened despite other people being there. Basically making me out to look over emotional and the aggressor in my own beating. 

Since then I have had to take a long hard look at my life with him and I no longer feel safe progressing with him. I bring up divorce repeatedly, and he will not leave the home, my bed, or let me go.....",be7896,2020-02-25 06:03:57,6,855,50.38,27.55,82.26,3.92,19,15.56,93.22,59.65,19.53,15.67,10.76,0.7,0.47,3.74,0,3.86,5.5,15.32,7.6,4.44,8.3,1.75,18.25,3.98,2.11,1.29,1.05,1.99,6.43,2.11,4.33,0,2.57,0.82,10.29,1.05,1.29,0.12,4.33,9.47,1.4,0.94,1.64,1.87,1.4,3.04,2.57,1.17,0.58,0.7,4.44,2.34,1.05,1.05,0.35,9.71,2.92,1.99,3.51,1.29,1.17,7.95,7.02,1.17,16.73,3.27,8.89,4.56,1.87,0.82,0.7,0.7,0.12,0.12,2.11,1.87,0,0,0.23,0,12.98,5.61,4.56,0,0,0,0,0,1.17,0.94,0.47,0.23

f9gn5t,Early 20s from the UK. My boyfriend hits me and can't take responsibility for any of his actions,"It started in January 2019. He called them ""love taps"". I had just gone through a separate traumatic event and we were both under a lot of stress. For the rest of the year, my mental health declined and along with his abuse, always telling me I'm an idiot, blaming me CONSTANTLY. In December 2019 I started reading and reaching out to people (online) and had an 'awakening'. I stopped internalising the blame he put on me, and started questioning his abusiveness. Self help books helped me feel less depressed, stressed, and anxious. I'm more level headed now, which only seems to make his treatment towards me and general attitude worse. I'm still in this situation. Selling my house (where he stays with me) and getting away. He has threatened to burn it down if I left him.

f9hy57,Was I wrong after all? Was staying a mistake? Is it me?,"Looking back (over more than a decade) there were signs that I would never have picked up on if I hadn't started learning while the last couple of years have been bad. My wife is older than me. I don't know if she's lashing out because she's insecure or if she has just realized that I'm no longer needed.

I'll try to keep it short, but here are some examples that gave me cause to learn about emotional abuse and narcissism:

Starting to make big decisions without me

Not telling me about day to day stuff, like leaving the house and not saying anything.

Zero empathy displayed

Ignoring/silence

Criticizing me for my harmless hobbies, getting into shape

I'm ""too negative/sensitive""

Trying to embarrass/humiliate me in public

I got into a serious accident that was due to her negligence ( could have died). She told the trauma nurses that I just ""liked the attention"" when they remarked that I was in relatively good spirits (it doesn't help to be a jerk to your nurses). Never apologized for the accident, never showed much concern, mocked me when I told her my doc said I was doing really well with healing.

Threatened divorce because she said I ""dont like to do things for her"". I had just driven 100miles in a blizzard to take her to a hospital appointment.

Plays the opposite game. I'm automatically wrong when I say something.

&amp;#x200B;

So there's more, but I think that paints a picture. I almost left her. We talked a lot and kinda came to an agreement to start over, but she didn't really apologize for most of it. She thought it was okay to spy on my email, for example.

That was a few months ago, but I'm starting to see things again:

Trying to compete with me for the dog's attention. I refuse to mess him up like that, but she will interrupt when I play with him, or tell him he's too tired to go running with me - and then take him out instead.

The ignoring, lack of interest/empathy, not telling me where she's going - are all coming back

Seemingly trying to push me out of a group activity we both do, bringing in a replacement, saying I can ""leave if I want to"".

Being mean about a performing art thing, saying I ""drove people away"", but then telling a friend the truth - that some of the audience had already said they had to leave early.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to believe it, but part of me isn't surprised. If it is narcissism, then I've read the stories of how this is supposed to go, and it only gets worse. I will have a hard time getting my life back together if I have to go, but I guess nothing is worth staying with a narcissist - right?

f9kvk4,Seeking mental healthcare for abuser,"Im in an abusive relationship, one in which him and I get rough and tumble. I ignored all the red flags because I see someone who is truly a gentelman with the one condition being and argument can escalate. Ill defend myself and fight back.

The part Im not sure of is if he seeks mental health treatment CAN things get better?

He was molested as a child, along with being physically abused, he watched his mother get physically abused, and he has turned much of his life into something for the positive. He knows he doesnt want to be the way he is, he knows its not healthy or safe. If he gets help can it get better?

The order says he isn’t supposed to be at our house or contact us in anyway but he has been staying here with us since his release. I have not called police again because I am scared of what he might do. He had his initial court appearance at the end of Sept 2019 and pled not guilty. Now he has another court date on March 2. My two oldest kids and I have all been subpoenaed to testify at the court that day. He has repeatedly told me that if I testify he will ‘make me pay’. I believe him. Now I am scared to testify. There’s also the fact that we live in a country where I have no family and no close friends. My income isn’t enough to support my kids and I alone and I haven’t been able to find any assistance even though I have asked at several different agencies. 
So I am looking for advice as to whether I should testify against my husband or not. I want out of the marriage. I’m just so scared of what he may do.",gda23,2020-02-25 20:09:54,11,239,13.48,45.02,57.77,2.86,12.58,17.15,89.96,62.76,20.92,18.41,10.46,2.51,0,5.44,0,2.51,2.93,12.55,13.81,5.44,7.95,3.77,20.08,3.35,1.26,1.67,3.35,2.09,3.35,0.42,2.93,1.67,0.84,0.42,16.32,2.09,1.67,0,6.28,12.55,0.84,1.26,2.09,2.93,1.26,5.86,1.26,0.84,0.42,0,0.84,0,0.84,0,0,7.95,5.44,0.42,2.09,0,0,5.02,12.97,1.67,12.55,0.42,5.86,5.44,2.09,0.42,0.84,0.84,0,0,0.42,0,0,0,0,0.42,12.55,7.53,1.26,0,0,0,0,0.42,0.42,2.93,0,0

Today at my hearing there were two representatives of the DA's office sitting in. One I recognized as the so called ""victims advocate"", the other I believe was an ADA. They didn't explain why they were there. 

They sat on his side. They talked to his mom between breaks. Their detective liaison testified against me (and committed perjury!) today. 

Am I reading too much into the seating arrangement? Or is this abnormal? My victims advocate (from the rape crisis center) said in 20 years she has never seen anything like this. She was shaken.

It’s been mostly non physical but everything else short of sexual abuse. For over a year I’ve tried to be the MVP of best friends. Supporting her when they had their issues. Reminding her of his patterns when things are “good now”. Offering links to services.  Going to the services to get in person info on her behalf cuz she’s too proud or ashamed or in denial to go to places like that. Now she’s been charged with felony assault after defending herself and child from her ex. I tried so hard to prevent this from coming to this extreme and it should have been him arrested. But here we are. She’s Finally trying to move out. Still reluctant to utilize the services specifically for dv victims. I can’t do it for her. I can’t watch her drown in her own stubbornness.

fa5f0v,How to Cope with Ongoing Abuse - Advice?,"Hello Reddit,

I  am writing for advice (articles, books, ideas, people to talk to,  organizations) about surviving an ongoing sexually abusive relationship.  This regards someone who is a wonderful soul and exceptionally  important to me, so any advice is greatly valuable:

There's  this woman whom I positively love. She's amazing and clever. But for  various reasons, she's financially dependent on her abuser. He's  horrible to her in every way: verbally, physically, and sexually  abusive. To complicate things, she has a history of childhood trauma.

She  is highly intelligent and motivated to survive, and she has realized  this isn't sustainable. Plotting to get out, she is in the process of  saving enough money to leave and start over, but that means remaining in  her current situation for many months until she can gather the  resources to escape. In her research, and my own, we're finding lots of  articles about how to deal with past trauma, but little inspiration as  to how to weather the ongoing kind.

I  want this beautiful person to get out as unscathed as possible. And in  the present, to learn how to cope with this terrible situation... I'm  looking for anything inspirational, anything useful, anything tactical.

If  you have anything to share - a passage or a story or a movie or advice  or a body of research or a poem - please do. This is a really special  person. And I know she's not alone. Has anyone else seen a situation  like this?  What do you do when trapped in something hellish? How do you  hang on to your sanity?

Thanks a million. I don't know you, but you're probably beautiful if you've taken the time to read and respond to this ❤️",adjectiveNounEtc,2020-02-26 18:58:45,3,291,54.84,78.54,17.8,76.56,13.86,24.4,90.38,56.01,16.84,9.97,2.75,0.34,2.41,4.47,0,6.87,5.5,16.84,8.59,4.12,11,1.03,14.43,4.81,1.72,3.09,0.34,2.06,9.62,6.19,3.44,0.34,1.72,0.34,14.09,0,0,4.47,0.34,15.81,4.12,2.41,1.03,6.19,0.69,5.15,1.37,1.37,0,0,1.72,0.34,0.34,0.69,0,5.84,2.06,1.03,1.03,1.37,0.34,1.72,13.75,0,8.93,1.03,4.47,3.44,3.44,1.03,0,1.03,0.69,0,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,0,20.62,6.19,6.87,0.69,0,1.37,0,1.03,0,3.78,0.69,0

Due to the amount of evidence his lawyer brought in it’s going to take a few days to find out if it’s moving forward to trial.

fa9xcv,So nervous,"Three years to the day, I left a 6 year relationship full of abuse. At every level. I had to plan out and find an escape when pregnant but was held captive since we had one vehicle and he worked all day. I felt so discouraged in ever getting free. He forbidden me to even drive to see my family for 10+ months. But let me back up. 

So first act of abuse was about one year together where he fractured my nose which I had to have surgery for.  It was his only time where he ever apologized for his abuse. I forgave him. Made up a story to protect him. 

For several years, abuse was more on than off. He'd change then he'd snap. He would say he loves me, then mention my 125lb body was fat. He'd say I'm smart then call idiot. He swore to propose only after I let him have a three way. 

Before I knew it, love turned into being groomed and brainwashed. I was told he'd hurt my family and then come for me if I ever let police know what he did. He said it would be my fault if he got arrested for making him that mad. Then tell me I'd ruin his potential career and it'd be my ass. 

Once he was losing his mind like never before. Before work, he snapped over discussing bills. He jerked me around our apartment and slammed me into a door frame. Then he picked me up by my throat and body slammed me, tightening his hands around my throat saying it was ""time for me to die"". Right as things we black he let go. I remember trying to breath and pull air in as if I was dying of thirst and got water. He kicked me in the side. Then as I try to get to bathroom, he shoved me into the tub and spat on me. 
But then finally knock at the door. It was the police thank god. The neighbor called them bc they heard the fight and me crying pit. But before he opened the door he said if ""I get charged w domestic abuse, he wouldn't be in jail forever.  So I had to lie to the cops. They didn't buy it but I begged so hard for them not to take him they finally agreed as long as we separated for my sake. So I left to my family's home. It was traumatic. I was in so much pain... but knew the signs of abuse were all there and they could report him. So I didn't go to the er. 
After that happened ...couple months later, I had been fine. Moving forward. I didn't ever go back for my stuff.   He left three page letter begging to just come talk. I resisted but finally gave in. We had a long talk. He pulled the stops to win me back and my dumbass believed him ....

fajecj,"How to stop apologising, after many years in an abusive relationship?","Hi there. My first post on here (F31). My ex (M34) was emotionally and sexually abusive, and would have violent outbursts at times. He never physically injured me, so it took me many years to see that it's still abuse even without the violence. I stayed with him for 9 years.  


TL;DR How do I stop apologising when there is no need for an apology?  


I got used to apologising a huge amount, for everything I may think I do or say wrong, for things I do wrong, and well... I apologise for simply being to be honest. I'm in a different relationship now, for the last 1,5 years. The man I'm with now is amazing, and he does not have a nasty bone in his body. He's being incredibly supportive of me going through all the stuff I am - I've recently started counselling for sexual trauma (from both ex and other men), and he's there for me as much as he can. We're long distance though, so rely mostly on webcams/chat.  


Anyway, he pointed out to me that I've been apologising a lot again recently. Just a little nudge that I don't need to apologise to him for random little things. I appreciate his nudge, as it's something I do want to stop doing - it's not a healthy habit for me nor is it good for our relationship.  


But how? I don't really notice it. I feel so bad for \_being\_. I feel bad for voicing any opinions or emotions. I feel bad for needing attention and talking ""too much"". I feel bad for feeling bad... My boyfriend is really understanding and caring, but I know he finds it difficult that I sometimes behave as if he's a danger. I know rationally he is not, but as my psychologist say, my anxiety levels are incredibly high 24/7. I have C-PTSD and other MH problems too.",LittlePurrx,2020-02-27 13:35:23,1,332,16.41,25.37,77.85,1.62,13.28,15.66,93.07,59.34,20.48,15.06,10.54,0.6,0,3.92,0,5.42,3.92,12.65,11.14,8.13,8.73,2.71,18.37,6.02,2.71,1.2,1.81,2.71,8.13,2.41,5.42,0.3,1.51,0,11.14,0,0.3,0,4.82,15.36,4.22,1.51,2.11,3.01,0.9,5.12,2.71,0.3,0.9,1.51,2.11,0.9,0.9,0.6,0,10.54,2.41,0.3,3.01,0.9,3.92,2.11,13.86,0.6,11.75,0.6,4.82,6.33,0.6,0.3,0,0,0,0,1.2,0,0,0,0.3,0.3,22.89,7.83,4.82,0,0.3,0.9,0,0.9,0.6,3.92,1.81,1.81
fajm2w,"Royally messed up in the beginning of my fiancé and I’s relationship, it’s being held over my head to the point of abuse, could REALLY use some advice or just to vent","This might be long, but I will try to make it as short and to the point as possible. I’ll start with some background info: I’m a 23F and my fiancé is 31M and we have a two year old son together. I grew up with not-so-great parents, they hate each other and I never really saw a healthy relationship growing up. I ended up moving out at 16 with a boyfriend at the time, and dropped out of highschool. When my then boyfriend and I broke up a few years later, I moved back in with my mother for a few months, and that’s when I really started to go downhill. I started doing hard drugs, coke and Xanax mostly, to be specific. During that time I met my now fiancé, on a dating app. We hung out the first night we started talking, and I stayed the night at his apartment. he got attached very quickly, and asked me if I wanted to move in. He told me he had a Xanax prescription and being the drug fiend I was at the time, felt like I’d just struck gold. So we would get BLACK OUT messed up together very often. I hesitated on answering if I wanted to move in, but it ended up happening eventually. 

Here’s where I fucked up and was a huge piece of shit. Before I’d met him, I was talking to a few people. One of them being my dealer who I’d buy most of my pills from, and we were messing around. My fiancé found out and rightfully so, told me to fuck off. I continued heavy drug use, and was a mess. Something ended up happening (trouble with the law, I’m surprised I’m not in prison) and it woke me up a little bit. My fiancé and I began talking again, and got back together. A few months go by, and I find out I’m pregnant. 

The DAY I saw that positive test, I quit EVERYTHING, cigarettes, weed, pills, everything. I decided it’s time to wake up and stop doing awful things to myself, and others. I was NOT a good person what so ever, and thinking about the past and what I’ve done makes me want to puke. My fiancé and I were stoked for this baby, and all was well. While I was pregnant, I had a lot of time to sober up and get ready. The epiphanies and self realizations I went through were mind-blowing. I couldn’t believe how horrible I’d been. I blame my home life growing up, but now I can’t put the blame on my parents anymore because it was up to me to change. Through out the time I was pregnant, my fiancé and i’s relationship was good. We had moved out of his apartment into something bigger, and we were ready for this baby, and I had cut off everyone from my past and anything that was affiliated with the life I was living before. I was ready to be a Mom, and a wife. 

Fast forward 9 months and we have our son. I couldn’t be happier, and my heart couldn’t have felt fuller. The newborn stage was rough, but my fiancé’s parents helped out SO much, and I’m so so so grateful for them. It might be relevant-ish to add that my fiancé was adopted when he was around 7 weeks old, and his parents are great.

But then we started to get into arguments more frequently. Most of them being about the past. Even if we’re arguing about something completely irrelevant he’ll end up bringing the past up again and say horrible things, and it’s gotten physical a number of times. For example, I might be frustrated about something, and maybe my I’ll raise my voice a little bit towards him, and from there it turns into a HUGE blow-out argument, and of course, the past gets screamed in my face even though it had NOTHING to do with the original issue. I’ll also mention, my fiancé has a pretty decent job, so I don’t have to work and can stay home with our son. It also doesn’t require him to be gone a lot, so he gets to be here too. 

My fiancé’s dad got sick about 6 months ago, his kidneys are failing quick. I got tested, and I’m a match for him. He just got on dialysis a few weeks ago while he waits for us to finish the rest of the testing and hopefully he’ll have my kidney by this summer. I love my fiancé’s parents. My parents don’t come around for my son, and my fiancé’s parents have a great relationship with our son and it is so important to me. I want my son to have his grandpa so I didn’t even second guess getting tested. Understandably, my fiancé has been stressing about that, and I’ve been trying to make things easier on him. But also, lately his job hasn’t been doing too good so he’s stressing about money, too. 

Our fights have become more and more frequent since then, and a lot worse, and almost all of them end up turning into him being mad about the past. I know what I did was awful, and I don’t know why he took me back, but I’m trying SO hard to make up for that, and to show him that’s not the person I am now. I didn’t care about myself, let alone anyone else during that time, and I’ll probably never forgive myself for the things I’ve done. 

It seems like every week we get into at least one HUGE fight. He screams in my face, spits in my face, hits me, and picks at every insecurity and flaw I have and literally corners me in a room and screams them at me. 

I still don’t have a license yet, I don’t have a GED or diploma, and my only job experience I have is McDonalds. Every. Single. Thing. That I have, is because of him, and he uses it against me. Just recently he told me I’ll never be able to make up for my mistakes, that I’m a whore, a cunt, a bitch, anything you could think of. He tells me at least he’s a productive member of society and that I’m not shit, and will never be shit. He told me he doesn’t love me. He uses our son against me, knowing I don’t have anywhere to go and that if I left I’d never have custody of him. But he also tells me to get out of his house every time we get into a fight. He tells me I’m just like my Mom (who has caused me so much grief and he knows it) he told me I should go find someone else who will work and let me sit on my ass all day (I don’t. I do almost all of the housework, and taking care of our son) but he also said “what the fuck do you do?? Clean??? Cook?? Who gives a shit. I can do that too, I don’t need you) it’s heartbreaking hearing this from someone who’s supposed to be my best friend. 

During these times he usually takes our son and heads over to his parents while I sit here feeling worthless, and can’t escape because I don’t have a license yet, and him and my son are literally all I have. I’m trying so hard to be great, but being told I’ll never amount to shit just makes me go back to feeling 2 feet tall and completely worthless. Now that I’m out on my own, I wasn’t taught anything useful as a kid, so now I feel as lost as ever. I don’t know what I’m doing with anything, and I’m fucking terrified of the future. I know he’s holding a grudge towards me, and I don’t blame him.. but I’m trying so hard. It feels like I’ll never be able to make up for shit, and my son will probably just grow up to hate me. But then... after we fight, he’ll usually end up hysterically crying and apologizing and he tells me how wonderful I am. I feel so stuck. I feel like it will just end up getting worse, and I’m so scared of what could happen. He always tells me to leave. How am I supposed to leave with nowhere to go? I can’t leave my son. And it’s obvious he’d be in better care with his dad until I get my ducks in a row.. and going about that also seems fucking impossible right now. Do I just deal with it? My son is my #1 priority. I feel like I’ll never be good enough, I feel like I really won’t ever amount to shit, and everything feels so hopeless. All of my shitty choices led me here and I hate myself. I just want to be a family. I hate feeling so uncertain of the future. My only option looks like a woman’s shelter, because I have absolutely NOTHING. I refuse to leave my son.

faovb8,Looking for advice - too many (or too serious) red flags?,"I posted this somewhere else, but maybe it still takes subject matter experts to really understand and be able to comment knowledgeably?

Looking back (over more than a decade) there were signs that I would never have picked up on if I hadn't started learning while the last couple of years have been bad. My wife is older than me. I don't know if she's lashing out because she's insecure or if she has just realized that I'm no longer needed.

I'll try to keep it short, but here are some examples that gave me cause to learn about emotional abuse and narcissism:

Starting to make big decisions without me

Not telling me about day to day stuff, like leaving the house and not saying anything.

Zero empathy displayed

Ignoring/silence

Criticizing me for my harmless hobbies, getting into shape

I'm ""too negative/sensitive""

Trying to embarrass/humiliate me in public

I got into a serious accident that was due to her negligence (I could have died). She told the trauma nurses that I just ""liked the attention"" when they remarked that I was in relatively good spirits (it doesn't help to be a jerk to your nurses). Never apologized for the accident, never showed much concern, mocked me when I told her my doc said I was doing really well with healing.

Threatened divorce because she said I ""dont like to do things for her"". I had just driven 100miles in a blizzard to take her to a hospital appointment.

Plays the opposite game. I'm automatically wrong when I say something.

So there's more, but I think that paints a picture. I almost left her. We talked a lot and kinda came to an agreement to start over, but she didn't really apologize for most of it. She thought it was okay to spy on my email, for example.

That was a few months ago, but I'm starting to see things again:

Trying to compete with me for the dog's attention. I refuse to mess him up like that, but she will interrupt when I play with him, or tell me he's too tired to go running with me - and then take him out instead.

The ignoring, lack of interest/empathy, not telling me where she's going - are all coming back.

Seemingly trying to push me out of a group activity we both do, bringing in a replacement, saying I can ""leave if I want to"".

Being mean about a performing art thing, saying I ""drove people away"", but then telling a friend the truth - that some of the audience had already said they had to leave early.

This last week or two she seemed irrationally angry, as if I had done something wrong but she wasn't going to tell me.

I don't want to believe it, but part of me isn't surprised. If it is narcissism, then I've read the stories of how this is supposed to go, and it only gets worse. I will have a hard time getting my life back together if I have to go, but I guess nothing is worth staying with a narcissist - right? Tell me if I'm overreacting, or I'm asking too much.",hardtravelling,2020-02-27 20:09:01,7,542,24.87,20.84,86.04,4.81,20.07,17.16,95.57,59.96,19.74,14.39,9.78,0.37,0.18,3.69,0.37,5.17,4.8,13.28,10.33,7.38,7.75,3.32,24.91,4.61,2.21,1.11,0.37,2.77,6.27,2.03,4.06,0.92,1.48,0,11.44,0.37,0.18,3.14,0.74,16.24,2.77,1.11,2.58,5.9,1.11,7.01,3.14,1.29,1.66,0.18,1.11,0,1.11,0,0,7.93,1.85,1.29,2.58,1.48,1.29,7.2,11.62,1.66,14.21,3.14,5.54,6.27,0.92,1.11,0.18,0.18,0.18,0.18,0.55,0,0.18,0.18,0.18,0,18.63,4.43,4.43,0.37,0,0.55,0,0.92,1.85,3.87,1.48,0.74

faz6v3,Life is spiralling. I feel I am going crazy or already lost it...not sure anymore.,"Am I over thinking things? I feel like I am losing my mind...or already lost it. Not sure. 

I have a child with my dh (32). When I met my partner everything was great, he was the best thing since sliced bread and we were so excited when I found out we were expecting ..then something changed in my partner. 

Here is some examples

We had gone grocery shopping and I was heavily pregnant. We were at the till and he flirted with the cashier in front of me. The woman seemed uncomfortable as I am just standing there pregnant. He continued to flirt with her and I remember I felt so crushed. We walked out the store and I had the trolley with the bags etc and he was like ""come on tell me what's wrong. I know there is something wrong. Tell me."" I hadn't shouted or anything just had taken what just happened in store on the chin. I was upset inside though. I was still talking to him, not ignoring. I was talking about other things unrelated (e.g. what we need to buy for baby e.g. mothercare cots etc. It was anything for me to forget and he says what's wrong tell me tell me. "" 
Then he was like ""OMG your jealous. You are jealous of that girl. OMG"". I guess I was and I didn't mean to be but I was. Maybe it showed . I can't explain how I felt other than numb. 

He has done this lots. 

2. Also in pregnancy, partner was like 
""I have something to tell you please sit down."" 
I sit down thinking something really bad has happened. 
He said along the lines of "" oh I can't tell you. you will just get upset"". 
I pleaded with him to tell me so he did
"" My colleagues at work have said you are ugly and have placed a bet that I can't possibly love you. I told them not to say such things about you and I got angry blah blah blah"". Can't remember the rest. Not what I expected him to say.
Well I started to get upset didn't i and I couldn't understand why they would say this since they didn't know me but he said he had shown them our photos of us together. 
""I knew it I knew u would get upset, this is why I don't tell u things, so emotional"". He went on. I would have been around the about to pop stage in pregnancy.
I don't mean to be emotional. I knew my body had changed during my pregnancy and I was coming to terms with all the red stretch marks that seemed to come out under my tum overnight.(thought I had escaped getting any) I ate healthy (occasionally pigged out) but I was growing our baby and as long as everything is good with baby that was all that obviously mattered but when he started telling me this I was devastated. He is a goodlooking guy and people seeing that he had me on his arm. 

After birth ...slimmed right down. I was so pleased with myself and how i made sure not to scoff my face as I do. ( crisps with sour cream and chive dip, cheese and crackers are my vice. biscuits also don't last a night in the house usually) So I was pleased I had lost my own self grown weight and also water weight from pregnancy. Dh bought me a waist trainer is that what it's called? (after a birth to help tummy muscles?). I thought oh ok thanks. He told me he had bought the biggest size . I thought oh ok ... Then he said it doesn't fit when I asked him to help secure the back. He laughed and said it doesn't fit babe. Got my sister to put it on me and she said it's too big. Need to go size down. 
Even when I was getting weighed in pregnancy with midwife he would come over to scale to see what I was. Like I don't keep secrets from dh but I did feel embarrassed when he raised his eyebrows.
So this sort of behaviour. 
Don't want to give too many of these incidents away. 

Roll on a couple years. I was meeting my friends that I made at the baby groups. Dh knew I was going with them the night before. Dh said it morning ""oh honey I am off today I thought we could go out today as a family "" . I never know my dh work rota even when I have asked for it in the past. He would always forget to find it in office etc. I would say take a pic of it and send me whatsapp and even then he has forgotten. So anyway I was thinking oh well I guess the girls don't need me there really (if i was just meeting one friend I would not have cancelled if I had promised but since 6 of them were going I thought I could just cancel. So I did. Told dh I cancelled and asked what should we do. Well he was so slow around the house getting ready and time ticked by. I was ready tot was ready as we had already had plans. (I was only meeting my friends for an hour or two that morning ) time kept ticking. Still in house. Dh is ready putting on his shoes. I ask him again so where we going and he said ""I am going out."" He informed me he is meeting up with his friends he will see me later. 

He will also only talk to me when he feels like it. Sometimes he has ignored me in he same room and I am not sure what I have done wrong? He says I know what I did and I need to think about it. 

I feel I am going mad and I am so upset with how my life has turned out. I can't cope. His kindness is like a drug to me but I am getting less and less of it.",ImpossibleSignal6,2020-02-28 10:28:21,1,1042,10.16,46.55,77.96,25.77,12.71,11.71,93.76,62.67,24.76,19.19,12.09,1.25,0.96,4.32,0.58,5.57,2.98,11.8,11.61,6.81,7.77,2.59,24.95,3.74,2.21,2.3,0.48,0.96,5.37,2.69,2.69,0.67,0.48,0.58,14.97,1.25,1.06,0.58,4.22,12.67,3.55,1.15,1.92,2.5,1.15,3.36,3.36,0.77,1.54,0.86,2.69,0.77,1.06,0.67,0.86,7.1,2.98,0.77,1.54,1.54,0.77,11.13,11.32,1.63,12.86,2.59,5.37,5.09,0.77,0.19,0.48,0.67,0,0,1.82,0,0.48,0.19,0.77,0.38,15.36,9.31,0.58,0,0,0.38,0,0,1.63,2.11,1.34,0
fb1gl0,Is this domestic violence?,"Could someone tell me if this is a kind of domestic violence? Long story short, my grandpa took away all the money that my grandma without her permission, because she was severely ill.

fblmsb,Numbers.,"There are so many wild numbers floating around the social media stratosphere at the moment. Statistics of violence against women, and men, and in our outrage we sometimes forget why these numbers affect us so much to begin with, or who they represent. 

Here are some real numbers, attached to a real family. 

39 - the age my Aunt, Debbie Mitchell, had her life snatched away.
4 - the number of living children left in her wake. 
17 - the number of non-parole years her killer (my uncle) received for wilful murder
0 - the amount of money left over for those children and their futures after the banks took their pounds of flesh
16 - the age I was, when he tried to put the blame on me for his argument that fateful day (which ironically is how long I've been in therapy)

18 years today - the time that's passed since the world shattered forever. We all glued the pieces back, but its never been the same. 

I wish I could put a number on how many people's lives were destroyed the day my beautiful Aunt was taken. Domestic violence affects us all, long after the tears have dried. You may not think your circumstances this dire, but THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE. Please, if this is you, please carefully get some help. Your safety matters. Your children's safety matters. YOU matter.

You don't have to become another number.",MandehM00,2020-02-29 16:09:12,1,237,57.94,90.44,36.87,6.77,14.81,15.61,83.54,50.63,16.46,12.24,3.38,2.11,2.95,2.11,1.69,4.22,7.17,11.39,8.86,4.64,5.06,1.69,16.03,1.69,1.27,2.53,2.53,4.22,5.91,2.11,3.8,0,2.53,0.42,15.61,1.69,0,2.53,1.69,10.13,0.84,2.53,1.27,2.53,1.69,2.53,0.84,0.42,0,0.42,2.53,0.84,1.69,0,0,9.28,3.38,0.42,3.38,1.27,1.27,5.06,8.02,1.27,15.61,1.69,6.33,8.44,0.42,0.42,0.84,0.84,0,0.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.99,6.75,5.06,0,0,0,0,2.95,0,2.53,1.69,0

fbtbmw,Don’t know what to do?,I (29F)been in a 5yr abusive relationship with (32M). I tried leaving so many times but end up coming back. He even got arrested about a 1yr ago because he got so intoxicated and was hold are 2yr old daughter as he was trying to hit me and verbally abusing me and he was supposed to watch are daughter that night because I had to work night shift as well. He made me get out didn’t let me take my daughter with me so I called the police. They arrested him. He was locked up for about 3 months. Then when he got out he contacted me even tho he wasn’t suppose to because he was on a no contact order. Then my dumb ass talk to him and he pretty much manipulated his way back in promising he wasn’t going to drink again and that he is a man of god now and he will never put his hands on me again or anything. But that was a lie! He slowly started asking for me to buy him beer and weed and they he wanted more and more then he started getting drunk and aggressive again. He hasn’t really hit me but he verbally abuse me and he grabs me and pushes me around. He is on probation so I know I can just tell his PO what he is doing but. He makes me feel like I’m a bad person if I send him back to jail. He threatens to hurt me or end me if I ever send him back to jail or anything to him because he says I owe him everything because he moved to another state for me and left his other 2 kids back in cali and he has no one here but me. I also though of just kicking him out my house since I’m the only one working and I pay for everything. But then I feel bad if I leave him homeless knowing he don’t have no one here. I don’t know what to do anymore! But I’m so tired of all the abuse and my daughter is starting to understand what’s going on.

fbx78q,Unsure on what to do,"First off to hide the identity of myself and my family I'm going to label the people in this conversation by what they are to me. (ex. grandmother, brother, mother, sister, etc.) I'd also like to say my grammar might be a bit off, since I want to get this out of me as fast as possible and don't want to spell check everything.  


For my whole life my mother has verbally abused myself and my brother which (I believe) has lead to me and my brother (16) becoming antisocial and untrustworthy of people. I'm currently 18 years old and I've always believed one day, surely, I will be able to move out with my brother and cut off complete connection with my mother. That was until recently. Before stating what happened I want to set the stage if you will. I live with my brother (16), sister (9), grandma (in her 60s) and my mother (in her late 30s). For around 80% of my life I lived with just my mom, brother and father but my dad was kicked out by my mom when I was very young. I only recently around 2 and half years ago moved into a larger apartment with my mom, grandma, brother and sister. Every month or so my Mother will blow up and yell at everyone and sometimes she takes me and my brothers stuff or breaks our stuff. She has hit me once or twice in my life but usually she doesn't get into anything physical other than breaking our stuff. Since I'm 18 now she's not allowed to touch me whatsoever or break my stuff so that makes me feel a bit more safe but I'm scared for my brother, sister and grandmother since they're all more vulnerable to my mother. I'd also like to note I've called the cops 3 times now on her for getting really angry at my grandmother for no reason and breaking a lot of stuff.   


Roughly 2 days ago she went overboard. CPS has been showing up to my house once a month for previous issues and the CPS lady who shows up made a report (because my mom wasn't letting them see my sister) and they had someone corporate visit. This is when she flipped out. She assaulted my grandmother and tried breaking into my room to presumably hurt me. I locked my door, barricaded it and called the police. She threw several things at my door and even tried to pick the lock to get in but I told her if she continued I was going to call the police, which is what I did right after saying that. The police showed up and talked to me, took my grandma outside and got her statement and then they arrested my mother and she resisted which resulted in her being pushed onto our living room floor and almost tazed (I was in my room). The police then took my statement and left. My grandma cried a lot and I told her it would be alright. My sister was crying too and I comforted her. I then had my friend pick me up and take me to his house (where my brother already was, he visits on the weekends). I was told my mother was allowed to come home yesterday and take her stuff (purse, clothes, etc.) but I wasn't here. I was also told her Dad doesn't want her staying with him so I'm assuming she's at a Hotel but the idea that she's committed suicide crosses my mind a lot. She's supposed to appear in court Monday (tomorrow) and go in front of a judge and I'm really scared of what's going to happen. I'm afraid she's going to be let off with a stern warning but no real punishment and she might come back to our house and harm or even murder me and the rest of my family. My grandmas dad just got put into the hospital too last night so I was forced to come home so I can watch my sister. I have a knife near me just in case if she shows up and tries to hurt me and my sister. What I really think is best and what I want is for CPS to take custody from my mother (for my brother and sister) and give it to my grandmother.

fcbj1r,Realized that I am a victim of domestic abuse,"Realized That I am a victim of domestic abuse (Florida)

Just Realized I am a victim of domestic abuse [FL]

I am currently seeking to gain joint custody of my child. I basically always knew the mother to be caddy, jealous, rude, selfish and generally narcissistic, it is why I tried to leave her several times before she told me she was pregnant. So, earlier this morning I started looking up definitions of domestic abuse and it’s checking one too many boxes and now I am having a full blown anxiety attack realizing, what I have been experiencing isn’t as crazy as I feel it sounds when I try to describe it to others. She has been gaslighting me since the beginning of the relationship, making me question my memory, my sanity and my self worth. She sexually abused me, made threats to keep my child from me, threats to ruin my life, reputation and also that of people close to me, stole money from my bank account and the list goes on. Before I was only trying to seek joint custody, but this process that I wanted to take a few weeks to hammer out has turned into a several month long slog where I am forced to go to her house and subject myself to further abuse in order to have time with my child. She continues to try and exert her control over me and I am at my wits end as no one seems to know what to do other than tell me to tough it out. She would also regularly denigrate me and made me feel, helpless, hopeless, depressed, and afraid.

I honestly could keep going, but now that I am empowered with this new knowledge I am wondering where to go from here. I already have a lawyer handling my custody battle and as it is too early to talk with them about this subject I am looking for starter guidance. Should I ask my current lawyer to help with this new “topic?” Or should I look for another lawyer to seek criminal charges if I am even able to find some kind of compensation for the past few years of hell that I have lived through? In the end all I really want is custody of my child. I was fine with sharing custody before when I convinced myself that she was capable of being reasonable, now I am fearful that as my child ages that her target might change to my child and I will do anything I can to prevent that.

I plan to find a therapist that specializes in this type of situation, but aside from that I am not sure what steps to take and in what order. Should I call the police? Get another lawyer for new litigation, or bring this to my current lawyer and expand the scope of work?

I tried to keep it vague for what I hope are obvious reasons.",epiphanyjones45,2020-03-02 04:45:32,7,504,44.14,17.55,83.26,1,26.53,16.67,91.67,58.13,21.83,14.68,12.3,0,0,2.18,0.2,7.14,3.17,15.67,8.73,4.56,6.15,0.6,17.86,4.76,2.18,1.98,0.4,1.79,6.15,0.99,4.96,0.99,2.58,0.79,6.15,0.4,0,2.38,0,11.71,3.57,1.98,1.79,3.17,0.79,2.38,1.39,0.6,0.2,0.4,0.99,0,0.79,0.4,0,9.13,0.6,1.98,5.75,0.99,0.6,4.56,12.5,0.99,12.5,1.79,3.57,6.75,1.59,0,0.99,0.99,0.2,0,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,9.33,2.78,4.17,0,0,0.79,0,0,0.4,0.4,0.4,0.4

I value my brain/mind above anything and knowing it’s probably permanently ruined is pushing me to want to end my life. I’ve talked to doctors but they don’t understand HOW BAD IT WAS, like it wasn’t just one concussion that I rested on, it was probably dozens over the span of months.

fch264,Friend of victim of 20 years of mostly physical and mental abuse. That is still continuing.,"I have never dealt with something like this. I've been talking this this friend since around early December, I picked him up and started being his friend and support because he had none, and I had a basic understanding of the amount of shit he's been through, but I had absolutely no idea. His biological father was in his life from birth to around 6 years old. He has constant ptsd that he comes to me about. He tells me about his bio father showing him how to cut himself, burned him, beat him, cut him with a hot knife, kept him back from school so no one would know, and constantly told him to kill himself all before reaching the age of 6. His mother was a constant observer and slight preparator as well, compared to all this. His dad is no longer in his life, he never told me how that happened, I'm sure he went to jail or something, but now he continues to try to contact my friend, and continue his ptsd and abuse.
 I thought this is where it ended. What made everything so hard for him now. He's in constant pain.
We hung out two nights ago. Before this he told my about his current stepdad. General fights, he would take his things, his family asks how much money he has constantly, and take everything he has, (also his things)and don't allow him to have a bank account, so they can do so. Pretty fucked up in its own regard, but I didn't think it was much on him compared to what he's been through. Until that night me and my other friend picked him up to give him a good time, some time away, and he had blood all over. Face and hands. He told me he got into a fight with his stepdad before he left. At that point I talk and help him through it, and show him a good night. He texts me the next day about how happy he was to hangout with people, and few hours later I'm told he's beaten again, busted lip, blood all over, swollen jaw, loose teeth, and that he was blacking out. I was asleep at this point, and a few hours later he tells me that he had been beaten again. I woke up a few minutes later, and I instantly told him to call the police, which he had already done, and he was being held. We worked through the moment, and around thirty minutes later his dad was released. He came home, and beat him for the third time, that he said he didn't consider so bad considering how much physical abuse and damage he had just taken. 
I really don't know what I should do or suggest to him at this point. He has no where to go even if he does just run away, and I already offered him to stay here most nights when me and my girlfriend get our car fixed. 
Any help or advice on this situation would be so much appreciated. I feel like there really is something I should do or suggest him but I really am at a loss. He's slowly coming closer and closer and closer to suicide. :(",naymp,2020-03-02 11:04:41,1,565,11.59,84.35,11.54,6.25,18.23,10.8,96.28,62.12,24.07,18.23,5.49,0.53,0,12.04,0.18,5.84,2.83,12.57,9.91,7.96,9.2,1.95,17.7,5.66,3.01,2.12,1.24,2.83,4.6,1.42,3.19,0,1.77,0.18,20,1.42,1.24,0.18,13.1,10.62,1.77,1.95,1.06,2.48,1.77,2.65,1.77,0.35,0.18,1.24,3.01,1.59,1.06,0.18,0,6.73,2.3,1.24,2.83,1.24,0.35,8.5,9.03,0.35,16.99,1.59,6.37,9.56,0.88,0.35,0.35,0.53,0,0.35,0.88,0.35,0.18,0.18,0.18,0,14.16,5.31,6.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.12,0.35,0

fckk1i,Suicidal Friend is in an Abusive Relationship and Needs Help,"My friend attempted suicide last night and am attempting to get her help she needs. She is in an abusive relationship with a married man that has set her up with an apartment, controls her finances, goes through all her texts, is threatening her with releasing sex tapes and pics, etc.

She is in Dallas and has two kids. What 800 / support numbers would you suggest I provide her? I want to support her and get her help but am a little bit out of my league on this one.

fcks09,"My wife's behavior has escalated, but I don't want to leave","I posted part of this situation on r/relationships, but I'll summarize the main talking points here.

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremost, I'll just say that my wife is abusive. Emotionally for the majority of our relationship, physically for the past year or so. She has extremely dramatic anger issues, is fond of calling me ""stupid"" or ""retarded"" (she knows my intelligence is a sensitive subject for me) when she is angry at me, and would get upset if I spent money without telling her (which admittedly is not necessarily abuse since I'm terrible with money and we both agreed on her keeping track of the bills - more on that in a minute). Over the past year this has escalated into trying to make me feel even more inferior by telling me that I'll ""never change"" and that I'll always be useless and stupid, as well as screaming at me if she thinks I'm ""not listening"" or if I stay silent she will say something along the lines of ""ANSWER ME!"". In addition to this, when she's at her peak stress she lashes out physically at me - I've been clawed in the face, punched more times than I can count, thrown against a wall so hard I left a body shaped indent, and have had my face forcibly grabbed and turned to her face. All in all, pretty awful.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, she only gets this way when she's in an extremely stressful situation. The first time, it happened during nursing school, where her classwork put her on edge and exacerbated her negative traits. But when she finished nursing school and we took a couple years to figure out what we wanted to do next, she was fine. More than that, she was wonderful, we still had issues but she actively acknowledged they were problems and we were working on resolving them together - we attended therapy together, initially just for me but we started seeing the value of couples counselling and we were working on our communication and beginning to set up boundaries that we hadn't established when we first got together (this is our first ""serious"" relationship).

&amp;#x200B;

Then, two years ago, we bought a business together, and after the first year everything got worse. A LOT worse. The business started doing poorly, we had to let people go, and zero days off combined with failing business combined with an utterly dangerous mindset of ""the business is our lives"" on her part turned her from loving-if-flawed wife to abusive tyrant who controls everything I say and do with an iron fist. Hell, I'm only posting this now because she's out shopping with her mother (which, as an aside, we live with her parents and they are both aware she is physically violent with me and have seen the scratches and bruises, but neither have said anything to her and I only know they're aware because her dad told me. Is that normal?).

I know the majority of advice on this sub is advice on how to leave, and I'm deeply moved at the amount of support people in need get from here. But for me, I don't want to leave. I still love her more than anything and I don't want a life without her. What I need, in a nutshell, is for her to see that she needs help and to actively seek it out with me. My post on r/relationships was all about how I could convince her to close up shop with me and seek out therapy to work out these issues (because while it may have been a lie, when she first started getting abusive she was horrified and was begging me to help her stop), and that's where I'm at now.

fcmqwp,My dad physically assaulted me,"Queens Village, NY

Today my father assaulted me because I had his car keys. He lunged at me trying to grab it out of my hands, and I did not let go. He then proceeded to punch me three times in the face, and I still did not let go. I wasnt fighting back in any way, just holding onto the keys. I weigh 120lbs and Im 5' tall while he is a 6' tall man that weighs over 250 lbs. He sat on my face and suffocated me with his thigh until I finally let go of the keys. When I got free, I tried to run to another room and he grabbed me by the shirt, opened the basement doors, and threw me down a flight of stairs. I tumbled down face first and hit my head on the wall. I got up immediately and called my boyfriend and then the police. By this time he fled the scene with his car and I still do not know where he is. The ambulance carried me away to the hospital while I reported the crime to the police and they said that hes going to be arrested and theyre looking for him. I have bruises all over my body and a mild concussion. 

I live with him and my family relies on him financially so I dont know what to do now. Im probably going to be homeless.

fcp0cn,I didn't realize it was abuse until it was too late.,"My husband has always controlled the finances. He kept his money separate from mine, which wasn't much as I am unemployed (stay at home parent/student). We have a 10 month old son. I was diagnosed with postpartum depression shortly after he was born, and spiraled bad for a while. He seemed nothing but loving and supporting during this time, wouldn't leave me alone with my thoughts.

Well, one of my concerns as time went on was that my entire family moved 1200 miles away, and every time I suggested saving for a flight to take our son and visit my family he would shoot the idea down. We can't afford that, some of your family smokes cigarettes, it's better if he's stays up here where he knows people, etc. But a couple of weeks ago, he offered me something I've been longing for: I couldn't take our child with me, but he would book me a flight to visit family. I was hesitant, but after discussion and constant assurance that he wasn't sending me away I accepted the offer and we booked the flight to Kansas City. He told me to take my time, and let him know when I was ready to come home, and we would get a return flight situated. 

I landed the afternoon of the 19th. Began to feel better mentally. I was able to visit friends, be there for my grandmother's services as she passed away just hours after the flight was booked. I sent a message on the 23rd letting him know I was ready to come home.

He ignored the topic for three days. It started to feel like he really didn't want me to come back, and I voiced this concern. Then Tuesday night (Feb 25) he told me I needed mental help, it's beyond him helping, he's sorry but he isn't sorry for the time spent together, this was out of his control and he still loved me. He spent that entire night convincing me that this wasn't his choice, we were staying with his parents and I wasn't allowed to return to my husband and son for reasons beyond his control, that he wasn't allowed to share.

I used a throwaway account to post on r/legaladvice. I had a free lawyer consultation. I wanted as much information regarding my rights as a parent and as a tenant at will in the situation. My SNAP benefits were frozen when I called and explained the situation because I was sent out of state without my card and didn't want to get in trouble for fraud.

We speak the following night. I offer to borrow money for a flight and for us and our child to stay at a motel for a few days while we sort things out with his parents. His story changes. He says it's my mental health, which had been on the decline and made worse by the medication I was prescribed. I said I knew I needed help, had been actively searching for a provider before I left. But he needed to provide sufficient proof of income and until he did I wouldn't be able to get Medicaid reinstated. I gave him a plan to seek immediate emergency care upon returning home while we get the insurance situation sorted.

The story changed again. I'm unemployed, he only makes 360 a month, he can't afford to take care of me anymore. I point out I had been taking steps to be self sufficient. That I had been paying for my own things, paying him back when he told me to. He didn't care how much I paid back, he was just looking at how much he had spent on me (but wouldn't tell me exactly how much). Started yelling at me, because he found my post on r/legaladvice and said he couldn't work through the ""threats of legal action"". It became a 90 minute shouting match before I hung up and, for the fourth time since this started, contacted the suicide hotline. Not because I was suicidal, but because I needed someone to talk to.

After I finished explaining the situation and started thinking about things I had let slide in the past, she suggested getting an advocate for financial and emotional abuse. He's done a lot of things that have bothered me greatly that I tried to set aside for the sake of our marriage and the sake of our son,  and at this point I have began to wonder if my depression was really postpartum. I did have a complicated pregnancy, but he made that situation worse mentally with words and actions. He moved me away from my family when I was six months pregnant. Started using my mental health against me.

Somedays, when I was taking the meds, it was so bad. Getting out of bed was a struggle. He would have to remind me to eat or take a shower. My mind was in a fog that a psychiatrist felt would be lifted if she increased the dose. He forced me to continue the medication while I found someone else for management.

And last night, he tells me I did this all to myself. That I shouldn't have let my mental illness get so bad. That I should have sought help sooner. That I should have found a job right now. That I rarely spend time with our son or take care of him, and ""don't give me the mental health BS"". That I claim I was taking steps for improvement, but that there was no change. That he was the victim and he couldn't - wouldn't - take care of me anymore. And has now left me homeless without our son as a result.

I'm... at a loss. The only benefit from this situation is in regards to realizing this has been years of emotional and financial abuse, that he's shut me out so I have had time to think of everything he did wrong. He hoped I had a miscarriage. He was barely there for me emotionally when I was diagnosed with preeclampsia and hospitalized at 35 weeks. He would offer to buy me games or whatever but would call it ""payment for goods and services"" - even if I wasn't in the mood. And those are just the tip of the iceberg.

I am not a resident where I had been staying, and the arrangements were only temporary, so I have no choice but to go back. I return tomorrow afternoon. And I'm afraid he's going to keep manipulating people and that he won't let me see our child. He's not willing to give me so much as transportation to a motel or shelter. He's refused to provide me with the paperwork to verify my financial aid and continue my education. He's refused to provide me with a signature to start an income driven repayment plan ($0/mo for a year) with my student loan servicer. And while he maintained for a while that he wouldn't keep me from our son, I'm terrified that he will and use my mental health against me.

fctet0,I live with my abuser and two friends. I need to leave him. Concerned about risk.,"TW: abuse, violence, sexual violence

&amp;#x200B;

Almost straight after breaking up with my first love 9 months ago, I became involved with my (at the time new) housemate and current boyfriend. He was the best-looking person I'd ever met, he really seemed to understand violence against women (which I've suffered from in the past) and he seemed like the perfect man. We waited for 6 months to make it official.

Before we were together there were occasions that he acted abusively. I stood up for myself every time, stopped sleeping with him several times, and he showed signs of improvement. This made me think he'd changed and I felt like I had equal power even though he messed up sometimes. After making it official things were really nice for a few weeks, but since they have been really bad. He's acted verbally abusively towards me on numerous occasions, gaslights me constantly (even during the 'good' periods), and emotionally abuses me quite regularly. I am unable to stand up for myself now because it often leads to more or worse abuse and he is completely uninterested in changing. A few days ago he aggressively slammed a door I was stood right in front of twice in a row and it was so hard that it caused our housemates' entire room to vibrate.

I want to leave him but it's difficult because I live with him. The tenancy agreement doesn't end until September and he has exams for his university course for the next few weeks then we have a break then I have my exams. I'm also worried about the risk of violence and more abuse. I've read 'Why Does He Do That' by Lundy Bancroft and it's amazing and has helped me recognize the situation I'm in. In his chapter about leaving abusers, he explains that even men who have never been physically abusive can become violent after breakups. He said that studies have shown that by far the most accurate predictor for future violence is the woman's gut instinct.

In my gut, I think it's possible he could be physically abusive towards me. I can't see severe violence occurring but I think he will definitely block me from leaving the room during discussions and spread rumours about me to friends. I can see him shoving/slapping/potentially even punching me and I'm worried about the impact that would have on my mental health and my exams. I can also see him being sexually violent. This is based on my gut feelings as well as his tendencies to go back on his word. So far every 'principle' he preaches he has betrayed. He preaches a lot about being anti-cheating, anti-using women for sex, anti-manipulation, anti-rape, and anti-physical domestic violence. I know for a fact he's done the first three to either me or previous partners, yet he'll still preach tirelessly against them and make special exceptions for himself. I'm also scared because, at the time, the door-slamming felt physically threatening and intimidating. That said I can only see most of this happening if we're in the house alone together.

I wanted the thoughts of others, please? I'm concerned and would like to hear from others who have been in similar situations.",_silly_billy_,2020-03-03 03:46:50,2,565,39.21,50,64.23,1,18.23,20.88,92.21,55.4,19.47,15.04,8.32,0.88,0,5.49,0.35,4.42,4.42,13.63,9.73,6.19,6.9,0.53,17.7,6.9,3.01,0.71,1.24,2.65,8.85,2.3,6.19,1.06,3.01,0.35,10.97,0,0.71,0.53,6.19,12.92,2.65,2.83,1.24,2.48,1.77,3.01,2.3,1.06,0.53,0.71,2.83,0.71,1.24,0.71,0,6.73,2.3,1.42,1.95,0.53,1.24,5.84,10.8,1.24,15.93,1.77,5.84,8.32,1.42,0,1.06,0,0.53,0,0.18,0,0,0,0.18,0,16.99,5.31,3.36,0.18,0.35,0.18,0,1.24,0,4.6,1.06,0.71
fcvb2j,Boyfriend screams at me after I accidentally broke a cup,"I'm beginning to feel very trapped and it's making me panic everyday because I don't know what to do. 

I've been in a relationship for a few months now (I am 18 and he is 22) I moved in with him about 2 weeks ago. I don't have a great relationship with my mum and she always hated my boyfriend since she met him. ( I admit that part of the reason I moved  in with him was to spite my mum) she specifically told me she'd disown me if I moved in with him and continued to date him. This has been true so far. 

When I first moved into his apartment everything was really nice but he soon changed his mood I guess. He's always so super angry all the time. He's always screaming at me which is something that he never did before I moved in with him. He really frightens me sometimes. I find myself freaking out when he pulls up in the drive way if an afternoon because I know he's gonna be mad at me for something. I once left my drink sitting on the table and he flipped his shit at me because I didn't use a coaster. So I apologised and started using a coaster but then another time apparently I used the wrong coaster and he screamed at me for it. He is very confusing he refuses to explain things to me. I'm so nervous around him. His yelling is so intimidating because he gets right in my face and it makes me panic 

Last night I accidentally dropped a glass in his kitchen and I thought he was going to kill me or something. He was yelling at me while I was cleaning it up telling me I did it on purpose but it was an accident I dident mean it. I cleaned it up and I gave him money for breaking it and he just snatched it out of my hand and told me 'not to fucking do it again'. 

Then a few hours after that happened he came up to me and asked for me to hug him and I did and he squeezed my ribs so hard I couldn't breathe properly he said something about me always making a mess. Anyway he dident stop squeezing me until I began crying for breath. 

So now I've no idea what I'm meant to do. I've called my mum and I told her about him squeezing me and she just basically said I told you you should have listened to me now what have you got yourself into. And she said no I can't move back in with her. And she's blocked my phone number and is currently ignoring me idk what to do I'm so stupid 

I've been googling domestic violence stuff and it's telling me to call police and they'll put me in a women's shelter and stuff but what is that ? Idk what that is I don't want to live in a shelter. This is too much for me I'm panicking so much. I've always been pacing back and forth waiting for him to yell at me when he gets home but now I've gotta worry about him squeezing me again. I want to just hide in the room but I'm worried that might anger him. 

Idk how to get out of this please give me some advice I'm honestly really scared because I don't know what I should do 😞 I want to move back in with mum so bad but she won't even answer the phone. 

I realise moving in with my bf was a mistake. I barely knew him. I don't want to be with him anymore but I don't want to be homeless! I feel like I've ruined my life and I've only just turned 18.

fd7l1g,I think my husband is abusive. How do I get help when I live in a state far from friends?,"Hello everyone, this is my first post from here so I am not quite sure how to introduce myself. I have been married to my husband for almost 3 years, and we have had problems with him having toxic behavior for the past 2 of those 3 years. Over time, it has just gotten worse. Today I had just gotten out of the shower, and he was in the shower and we were talking. He was saying something about someone his brother had met, and as he kept saying it I said ""I don't know who that is"" or something along the lines. I did kind of yell it but not necessarily scream, but that set him off. He started throwing things at me that were in the shower and even broke the top of one of the bottles. He told me himself that he'll never directly hit me because I'll call the cops, because I apparently want to call the cops and am using him for money. He's not rich, but makes about $7/hr more than I do. He likes to use this against me. He also went on telling me how my whole family, grandparents, sister, mom, no one gives a shit about me. Later while he's at work, he has the nerve to text and ask when I'm going to apologize. I texted him saying I shouldn't have yelled, but he had no right to throw things. He still thinks it's somehow my fault and I am to blame for everything. He may not directly punch me in the face, but there are times he grabs me hard and I have to tell him to stop. He is from the middle east, and personally from what I have seen in his culture for the past 3 years I find it to be a very sexist culture. He likes to tell me how I would basically be a piece of shit without him and that before him I couldn't cook or clean right. He doesn't help out around the house, because even though I cook,clean, study, and work he apparently can't help with any of it and believes he's a saint if he does. As I'm sure many previous abused women feel, I'm scared to leave because we have so many things jointly made together, bank accounts, car, lease, etc. Luckily, no kids. 3 years ago I moved from the midwest to a southern state, and I honestly don't have many friends here. My friends know everything he has done, and they know I plan on leaving him eventually. I just don't even know the first steps to go about it. He is so fucking toxic and just an awful person all around. I hate being stuck with a man child who can't even pay his own bills without my help, who I make breakfast and dinner for and constantly feel unappreciated and emotionally abused. I don't know what to do at this point and I know it's damaging my mental health as I do feel hopeless at times. Please, any and all advice is appreciated. Also, I do have many recordings of the things he has said to me and proof/evidence. I know this may be useful in the future. Please, help in any way you can with words of wisdom or advice.

-husband is a veteran with PTSD who has had to jump through hoops to receive any sort of mental health care
-No history of violence in our relationship until...
I was 6 months pregnant (with our now 13 month old), we had an argument (I can't even remember what about) and he pushed me to the ground.
Then today happened. After therapy we were fine and decided to have a beer. Ran into a POS who sexually harassed me at my job until I quit. To my husband I said ""I'm surprised he isn't a registered sex offender"" to which my husband said ""That's mean don't say that, he isn't that bad."" The person is physically ""handicapped"" more like disfigured. I looked at my husband and said ""He told me he was going to bend me over in the bathroom. He said he was practicing yoga so he could fuck me. My coworker who doesn't even like me was so disgusted with the things he was hearing he yelled at the guy and tried to kick him out. Then our boss, YOUR boss, looked at the manager standing next to me and said 'She's a female bartender, that's part of her job. He isn't kicked out.' YOUR boss didn't even look at me while he dismissed me. Do you still think I'm mean?"" Husband stayed silent while said POS came over and tried to have a conversation. We get home, puppy had an accident, I don't clean it up because I just need some fucking help. Husband sees it and gets mad that he's cleaning it. Really, no words were exchanged. I walk downstairs to run on the treadmill and I hear crashing upstairs. I run up to grab the baby, he doesn't want to give her to me, I say I don't want her to see you throw things and go back to our bedroom with her. He follows me down yelling ""you can't take my daughter away from me"". I don't notice he grabs my gun...he fires it. Not at me, not in the same room as me. He fires it at the laundry room ( I find out after the police arrived). I'm locked in the bedroom with the baby. I thought he was dead, but I wasn't sure. He had a suicidal episode years ago when he couldn't get help and he tried everything in his power to get help. Then he tried to come in the bedroom, gave up, I heard him walking around upstairs. I immediately called his therapist. I told the therapist there was no way I was getting the cops involved if it meant he would get arrested. It would ruin our lives. We sacrificed too much to get where we are. Therapist said he wouldn't go to jail and calls 911, dispatcher asks for my husbands info and I tell her ""No. I won't give it to you if you're going to arrest him. He didn't threaten me."" I'm assured he wont be arrested and they just want to make sure he is safe and gets help. He's arrested. He was point blank honest with the officers. Officer said even though I am not pressing charges the prosecuting attorney might. I feel like the system failed us. He buckled under stress he wont talk about to me or his therapist and jail is only going to add to it. More bills, less job opportunities, family is affected, etc. I understand they need to make sure I'm safe and so is the baby. I deeply feel like a place to address his mental health would have been proper. What the fuck is jail going to do for him/us other than pile on more shit?
We are generally supportive of each other. 99% of our fights are ""I'm so angry you wont just take a day to yourself to relax"". The other 1% is ""you literally took the garbage to the can and left it on top instead of opening the can and putting the trash inside..""
 His coping mechanism is stonewalling or ""I'm just a fuck up who can't do anything right"". Mine are pretty terrible too, but we don't do name calling (once ever) and physical abuse isn't in our routine. He gets mean when his ex girlfriend gets nasty about their kid. Hence he automatically escalated to ""you can't take my daughter from me"". In the past he has said he would take our daughter from me and make sure I didn't get custody with the dirt he has on me. We weren't even arguing. It came up after he got off the phone with his ex. I would generally say he is a great dad. He is supportive, loving, affectionate, and patient. I say generally, because sometimes I have to stop him and say ""Would you be okay with our daughter being treated this way by her SO"".

I honestly don't know if I'm delusional and not realizing I'm in an abusive relationship.

fde2bi,Violent step brother is coming home and I'm panicking,"my step brother is coming home today. He was sent to live with one of his grandmas about a year ago because of an incident that involved him attacking me. He's coming back now I'm not really sure why (no one tells me anything) I think the grandma he was living with has gotten very sick or something ? I never met her but I know she's pretty old. 

Anyway I'll call my brother jay. Jay is 18 now and I'm 15 the incident happens a year and a bit ago I was 14 he was 16. He basically choked me with a belt strap and tried to strip me naked. 

This all happened not long after I'd met him. His dad married my mom nearly 2 years ago and I'd only met jay after they were married and he moved in with us. 

Jay is very intimidating to me. I don't like the idea of him being in the house again I'm really scared I don't know why everyone's so calm about him coming back. 

I feel like I'm jumping out of my skin I don't want him to live here again he truly scares me. Since I was told he was gonna come back I've been having nightmares of it. Which I haven't had since the incident happened ( I was wetting the bed and everything for days after because I was so terrified) 

Ive been practicing sliding my desk in front of my bedroom door so no one can get in my room while I'm in there. I probably sound dumb like I'm overreacting but he attacked me out of nowhere he was on something idk what but he was going to hurt me the only reason he dident was because I screamed the whole house down and his dad walked in and stopped him. 

They sent him away because they dident want him near me so I don't understand why he's coming back now 

My mom won't explain things to me I'm so confused. They say he's better now. But that dosent stop me from panicking about it. He was gonna rape me I specifically remember him saying he was going to 'shove my d*ck inside you and let yo bleed out' I was only 14 it really traumatised me being that terrified. 

I feel like everyone's just ignoring that that happened and is acting like he's this whole new amazing person 😞 I don't want to be rude to him but I don't want to say hi or say anything when he gets here. My mom &amp; stepdad have told me I need to come out and say hello when he gets here but I'm not going to I'm just gonna sit in my room. 

I was told I'd never have to look at him again and now they're saying I have to speak to him ? 

I feel like no one is understanding that I'm still very scared of jay. I've been internally panicking all day. 

I'm not trying to be a brat or anything or ruin anything for anyone I'm just freaking out and no one cares.

His behavior has escalated over time, and now involves some of his family (his father assaulted me, and his mother and father kept me away from my daughter for an entire day)  It started with threats of violence, escalated to breaking things around our home, and now he's putting his hands on me with increasing frequency.   His assaults have ranged from holding me down, to choking me until I urinate on myself.  Yesterday was the worst one yet.

He has a small bruise on his face now, but with no visible marks on me at the moment.  I have dozens of other pictures of when i DID have marks put on me, and screenshots of him admitting to brutalizing me.

fdmqht,My flashbacks won't go away,"Hi Everyone,

I want to share a little bit of my story in hopes that others will find comfort or a sense or relief from this.

I was always one of those people that thought ""well if your boyfriend is beating you why do you stay?"" A very ignorant thought I have since realized now that I have gone through my own domestic violence situation. In November, my ex boyfriend of 2 1/2 years broke into my house through my window at 2am, walked into my room where I was laying on my bed and went ballistic. We had broken up a week prior and were not talking much at all. He had called me that night  (very intoxicated)  and asked if I would pick him up at the bar because it was too cold for him to walk home (his license is permanently suspended due to his felony DUI) I said ""No, I am going to bed"" and hung up the phone. Did not think much of it as my ex is a drug addict/alcoholic and would do this all the time during our relationship. I was laying in my bed and heard my door open, I didn't look or think twice about it because I thought it was just my roommate coming in to grab something. I looked at the door and my ex was standing there. My ex has mentally, physically, and sexually abused me throughout our relationship but he was a typical narcissistic ""well if you hadn't done that then I wouldn't have hit you"" type of guy and deep down I knew what he was doing to me was not OK but was too ashamed to say anything to anyone. He manipulated me and got me to think that him hitting me was an accident and thought that if I was a better girlfriend he wouldn't hit me anymore. However, I am not the type of girl who would sit there and do nothing, I would try to fight back anytime I could. Anyways, he had walked into my room and started to attack me, throwing me against my bed post every time I caught my footing and was able to get up. My roommate was in her room and had not known it was my ex who came in, once he started screaming at me she realized and came out of her room to see what was going on. My ex was on a lot of drugs and was drinking on top of it, he was stumbling and pacing back and fourth from my room to the hallway. He had tried to come in my room again for ""round 3"" of kicking my ass and I was using all my strength to hold him back so that I could try to shut the door, he was pushing me and screaming at me calling me every name in the book, telling me how fucked up i am and at this point I was just exhausted and fed up, I knew that if I didn't somehow stop him soon I would get really hurt. He was grabbing me and wouldn't let go of my arms, I finally was able to release my right arm and I was so enraged that I just decked him in the face that resulted in a nice scar on my hand but boy... it was worth it. Everything that happened that night is a blur, I have trouble putting pieces of the night together and even had trouble telling the cops what had happened when they arrived. The punching and grabbing and pushing continued for what felt like hours until I had followed my ex to the hallway where he was pacing to try and push him out of the door so I could at least lock it and catch my breath, he turned around with both his hands, grabbed me by the neck and lifted me off the floor. He was smashing my head into my kitchen cabinets and I couldn't breathe. This was one of the first times that I was genuinely scared for my life because of him. I said ""please, please stop"" and he wasn't letting up. I have never to this day seen the face on my ex while he was choking me the way it was that night. I now have flashbacks everyday of this moment and constantly replay it in my head. He finally let go after 2 minutes and my roommate had come out with pepper gel and sprayed the entire canister all over his face, she didn't realize at the time that when you spray mace in an enclosed area it attacks everyone within a 50ft radius. I had pushed my ex's face to get him out of the door and touched my face not thinking and got pepper gel in my eyes, I dropped to the floor and was screaming because I couldn't see and was scared that he was going to come back in, I was rinsing my eyes with cold water in the sink as fast as I could in the case he came back into the house. My roommate had called the cops and they were there within 3 minutes. They had come in and at this point my ex has fled the scene. The cops caught him not even half a mile up the road stumbling. They arrested him, emptied his pockets and a bag of cocaine fell out. My ex has 5 charges on top of a charge for breaking probation from his felony DUI that he had just gotten out of jail for not too long before this. Here I am 4 months later making this post. I have anxiety attacks everyday, they get so bad I can't breathe and I just start shaking uncontrollably. I can't be alone in my house for long periods of time because I think my ex is going to break in again. I am embarrassed, I am upset at myself for not getting over this already. I get mad at myself for not being OK, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I go to therapy once a week, I replay that night in my head so much to the point where I just want to put a bullet in my head to stop the constant thoughts. I'm scared to go out in public in fear that I will see my ex in public as he lives in the same town as me only a mile and a half away from me. He was brought to jail that night and his mother bailed him out the next day. The court system has been useless and all they do is give him a continuance every time he has a court date, he's not on house arrest, nothing. All I got was a lousy protective order and debilitating anxiety. I repress my feelings and don't talk to anyone about anything because I don't even have to words to explain how I feel which is why I recently started seeing a therapist. All I can think is why I didn't do something to stop it earlier, why didn't I try harder to stop him from raping me, why didn't I try harder to stop him from hitting me, why didn't I try harder to get out. Is he sorry? Does he feel remorseful? Why do I care if he feels bad? Is he going to be OK in jail? Is he going to do this to another girl? Is he ever going to stop being abusive? I have gained a lot of respect for women who are involved in domestic violence cases, it is NOT as easy as just ""leaving him."" I want to apologize to any victim of crime/domestic violence for ever thinking that domestic violence cases are not as important, for being ignorant and not doing my research, for not trying to put myself into someone else's shoes. I am struggling everyday to just plain and simply live but I have also gained a lot of strength and knowledge from this as well. 

Most importantly, what I want others to gain from this is that it is OK to be sad, it is OK to be mad, to be scared. There are others, there is me who feels what you feel. I hope this brings comfort to victims of domestic violence, I want you to know you are not alone. Domestic violence is a real thing and it needs to be talked about more. It is not as easy as ""just getting out of the relationship."" I have shared my story with you all today and I know there are cases that are much more severe, cases in which people are killed but this is what I went through and how I am coping with it.

fdpb9c,How do you deal?,"I may regret posting this and take it down later. Forgive me for that.  I've been dealing with a violent ex for more than 16 years. After the first incident I ended the relationship. Since then I've been stalked, harassed, physically harmed and emotionally tortured. I've had three incidents in the last six weeks where I've nearly lost my life because of violence at the hands of this ex. I could use some encouragement and some help -- if you are able to give it (privately would be my preference). I was turned away from every DV shelter in a 400 mile radius from me. What do you do when you are at the end of the road in terms of law enforcement help, DV shelters and church resources? I literally want to die of shame, fear and exhaustion. 

In the last sixteen years I've lived in more than a dozen DV shelters, countless hotels and hostels in multiple states. I've lost jobs, friends, a solid sense of self, my life's savings and a stable support network. I've moved countless times to preserve my life and my mental health. I've exhausted every resource available to me. While I am still standing there are many moments, including now that I don't want to be. 

I post this because despite a deliberately positive outlook I am struggling. Asking for help is something that I struggle with. Anxiety is something I struggle with. PTSD is something I struggle with. Life is something I struggle with. Yet I get up and deal with what life throws at me. 

What do I do? I am an orphan and don't have family support.",misslse,2020-03-04 19:44:49,4,280,48.63,26,80.09,1,11.67,20,87.86,55.71,18.57,13.21,11.79,0,1.43,0,0,5.36,5,14.29,12.5,2.86,6.07,0.71,18.57,3.21,2.14,2.14,2.5,2.86,8.21,1.79,6.43,2.86,1.07,1.07,6.07,0.36,0.36,0,0,10,1.07,1.79,2.5,3.21,1.07,1.43,0.71,0,0,0.36,3.57,0.36,3.21,0,0,8.57,2.86,1.43,4.29,1.07,0,3.93,13.93,0.71,14.29,1.07,5.36,7.5,1.43,0.71,0.36,0.36,0.36,0.36,0.71,0,0,0,0,0,17.14,7.5,3.21,0,0,1.07,0,0.71,0,3.93,0.71,0
fdrzpm,5 years today this happened,"So this is the story 5 years today that my ex tried to kill me. I met my ex in 2014, I was introduced to him by my second sons dad, the start was amazing and he constantly showed me love! Constantly telling me I could of picked anyone but I picked him, constantly doing things for me but then things changes. 

we had been together for about three months, when he took me to his mums wedding together, looking back it was after this night that everything changed, he would always tell me how lucky he was to have me, how he never could imagine being with a woman as beautiful as me, how lucky he was that I chose him! After this night where everyone was telling him i was way out of his league he got a bit upset and I reassured him I was the lucky one as I had done before because before this night he had done so much for me and helped around the house etc it was a true partnership, then gradually he began to stop doing things whether it be for me or round the house and he gradually started started saying how lucky I was to have him and he’d tell me how he could have his pick of any woman he wanted but he chose me and I should be greatful he did that because who else would want a single Mum, he chipped away my confidence and destroyed any self control I had, I was then his puppet to control as he wished, then one day after an argument he came back upset saying he had tried to go see his son and his ex wouldn’t let him and he stayed at his own house that night, he was acting strangely and I began to get scared we txted through out the night and we said good night love you, I called him the next day and he didn’t answer, this was strange because a pin could drop and he would wake up so I rushed round there as I feared he had committed suicide (he had attempted multiple times before) I used my key and key myself in and was scared shitless.

As I made my way upstairs to the hallway I called Out  his name nervously, until I suddenly heard him screaming aggressively for me to get out his house now, I stormed into his bedroom and it was not as I had thought he wasn’t attempting suicide he was infact in bed with another woman, she asked who I was I replied “in his fucking girlfriend” she called him a prick and apologised to me as she left and I said sorry for the embarrassment, and in that moment as I seen the woman that was leaving I had a sudden rush of realisation.

I began shouting at him that he would never find a woman better than me and how if that the type of woman he can get then clearly he had won the lottery a million times over with me, I told him I would move on and eventually forget him whereas he’ll remember me for the rest of his life, and I as I told him it was over he back handed me, I stood there holding my cheek in shock he then grabbed me and dragged me down the stairs, my bag was upstairs and no way was I leaving my phone and purse With him!

 So I shrugged his hands off me and told him straight that I was going to get my bag and rushed upstairs to get it then within a second I heard “IM GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU!!!” the way he screamed it scared the hell out of me I ran into his room and shut the door and put my back to it he began kicking and punching the door, there was literally shards of wood flying everywhere he had made a hole big enough for him to lean into the room and he grabbed me by the hair repeatedly telling me he was going to kill me, I used my foot to grab my bag as I tried desperately to keep the door shut, I dragged it over to me and tried to dial the police but he got more violent and went to hit me so I  dove onto my side, as I lay there helpless he picked up a long sharp shard of wood and lifted it in the air and screamed he was going to kill me I was in a tight spot between the bed and wall so couldn’t move so I just curled up, covered my head and raised my leg as a barrier to gain time, a few seconds pass and it falls silent I turned my head to look at  what he’s doing and as I put my leg down and move my hands from my head he immediately starts stomping on my face screaming at me, I can’t remember what he was saying because I was screaming for help, I begged him to stop, then all of a sudden all I could see was darkness I can’t even explain what it was like, I could hear and feel everything but couldn’t see, I screamed at him that I couldn’t see, he began screaming at me to get out but I couldn’t see And I kept screaming that at him and asking him to help, my vision came back a few minutes later and as I was half way from standing up with my legs like jelly he punched me to the floor again and continually punched me over and over again until he stopped to scream at me some more and tell me how this was all my fault as he stood by the bedroom door it was at that moment I got a surge of strength from god knows where and quickly jumped up and ran literally for my life, he chased me out the house screaming if I phoned the police he’d kill me and when I got into the street at the bottom of his drive I literallycollapsed  I had no energy.

whilst laying in the side of the road I got my phone from my bag and called the police he suddenly came out  got into his car and tried to run me over! Luckily I got out the way! I begged the police to hurry before he turned around and came back I told them I’d meet them at the shops round the corner, I had to hang up as I realised my kids were due to be picked up from school I called my sister and told her to call my mum and arrange someone to pick them up, I was stood there balling my eyes out and my eye had already begun to swell and nobody comforted me literally hundreds of mums and dads passed me and not one asked if I was ok and all I wanted was a cuddle. 

I had to have a head scan and As I waited for it the whole waiting room stared at me whilst I tried to hold my tears back, when my mum came in I couldn’t wait to hide my head in her shoulder and just sob my heart out and then I said “atleast I didn’t have kids with him and never have to see him again!” Because that’s me I’ll always find a positive, I then began to worry about the kids and my mum reassured me that my step dad was picking them up and they’d be fine, I told her under no circumstances can they know what happened, due to them being used to having seizures and injuring myself I told my mum we’d tell them I’d hit my head on the kitchen side as I had a fit, after having my head scanned and taking three hrs to make a police statement I was finally allowed to go home with my Mum, as me and my mum made our way into her back garden her dog seemed confused by me and started growling at me even her dog couldn’t quite tell if I was who she thought I was, as I walked into the kitchen at around 9.30pm my two babies  who were 4&amp;7at the time came running in to greet me my youngest ran into my arms whilst my eldest seemed to not want to come near me, my youngest asked “what happened to your face mummy” I replied in my silly voice “well guess what I had a fit in the kitchen and whacked my head off the side!! So I had to go hospital!!” He then laughed and said “ohh mummy you donut” and gave me a cuddle it was the comic relief I needed after such a draining day, my eldest then said “where was Brian though?” I replied “we aren’t together no more darling I’m sorry” he replied “but why??” I simply said “I saw him kissing another girl so I ended it” he then said “did he do that to you mummy??” I lied and said no darling come here and he walked over and gave me a hug... I knew he didn’t believe me but I couldn’t understand how! Yes he had controlled me but the one part e had no control over was how I was with my kids, when it came to them no matter what he said or his suggestions I refused and my son had never seen violence or anger from my ex and I couldn’t understand it, he began pestering me to tell him the truth and so I took him to my mums a few days later and we told him a sugar coated version and basically said he had just slapped me, he knew already he just wanted me to be honest but it broke my heart that he knew, such an innocent child who knew nothing of abuse knew this pathetic excuse of a man had done this too me!!! I always see him and his family and they all make comments at me and it’s horrible but luckily I know how to hide my fear and anxiety, I can walk past them and want to burst into tears but my face looks composed with a slight smile as I walk past with my head held high... after the ordeal and once I was ready to date again I have vowed to never let anyone talk down to me and raised my standards by a lot, I’ve been single three years now and only started dating in the last year but I am so full of confidence it’s unreal this idiot made me realise what I truly want in a life partner and it’s everything he isn’t!!

In December 2018 I met an amazing man who is now my fiancé, he is the most supportive man I’ve ever met, I don’t feel like I have to earn his affections either, if he gets pissed off he doesn’t take it out on me at all ever! First time I seen him angry was when a stranger threw a empty bottle at me in a store, he screamed at them and demanded they apologise, I was freaking out at the anger and couldn’t even look at him, when he walked away toward me he wrapped him arm around me kissed me and went back to normal. I can’t thank him enough, I never have to explain why about anything and when I begin to he tells me to calm down.  My boys absolutely love him and after all that happened with my ex my eldest son found it really hard to trust others, when my fiancé asked their permission to marry me my son jumped into his arms.

With my ptsd I’m not sure I’ll ever truly get over it but with every year I’m getting stronger, 4 years ago I’d be hyperventilating on my livingroom floor just from hearing a car door shut, now I don’t care. It’s getting easier to live with and I have a lot to work on but I’ve worked on a lot on other stuff and it bothers me less.

fds18r,No empathy,"About a month ago I rescued a little dog. I had to put one of those leashes that gets tighter when you pull on them around his neck. The dog didn’t understand I was taking him to safety, and he tried to escape. Every time he tried, he pulled away, which made the leash get tighter around his neck. He choked each time and that made him stop pulling away, but then he’d try again.
In the end, he was confused. He was safe but I was heartbroken to see him with his eyes all red and so scared, and I cried for a while after it happened. 


I keep thinking about how I cried for that little dog because he accidentally got hurt while being rescued, and I keep wondering how my husband doesn’t react that way when he sees me with my eyes all red and my body all bruised from his choking and beatings. 


He says he has no empathy for me because I’m a horrible person. But I think he just has no empathy at all. Because no one with an ounce of it would make someone else endure what he made me endure. I was helping that dog, and will do it again for rescue purposes, but I hope I never have to. 


I can’t imagine putting another being through that situation if it’s not in order to save their life. 


But to my husband? It’s nothing. 


He choked me so hard my throat still hurts days later. Him?

fdxh8v,(UK) How can I get the doctors to hear me about my head injuries?,"Over the last 8-9 years, I've probably taken at *least* 700 or more blows to my head through domestic violence.  
   
In January 2019, my abusive ex assaulted me for the last time. 

I didn't go to the doctors as they never listen. They don't take me seriously. But since then, I have had a non stop headache. I'm constantly dizzy and I wake up every morning feeling nauseated and every single night when I go to bed I wonder if I'm going to wake up tomorrow. 

When I have told them about my headaches, they say ""it's stress"" or try to blame it on my lifestyle - diet and sleep which I have changed and monitored all of that with no difference. 

How do I get them to hear me? My head shouldn't feel like this. I haven't had a single day without a severe headache with dizziness. It feels like my brain is being clamped really tightly. I'm so scared. 

My memory is impaired - I can't take in big chunks of information, I forget everything, I cannot hold eye contact anymore, I get extremely flummoxed in any kind of situation (even simply ordering a McDonalds meal is enough to trigger a melt down as I can't get my words out and when I do they're jumbled or I order something completely wrong and don't even realise.)

fea6xd,What should I do?,"I was lucky. I left before it could get really bad. I was in a domestically abusive relationship for over 15 years. Married with 3 children. I was devastated when the divorce process didn’t help me or my children. The biggest problem was, I never called the cops when he got violent. I kept my bruises a secret. And the one time I called the police, he charmed the female cop into believing a scratch I left on his chest was because he was the actual victim and not from me as I fought him off of me. I never called the cops again after that. I finally left when a love letter came in the mail from one of the many women he was having affairs with. See, here’s the thing, I didn’t realize how bad it had gotten. I didn’t realize how controlling he was. It wasn’t until I was free, that I realized how fucked up it had been for me. 

The thing is, I see him successfully banking on his personal protection company. The divorce process, protected his reputation. The worst thing that could happen was that people would find out that he beat his wife, all the while providing services to protect execs and celebrities. He’s making millions from this. And trust me, I cannot get this man to pay things for our children. All that money, is his, he’s never been one to share. I mean, I just bought my children freaking hand soap, despite the children and I asking him to buy them soap for months. They‘re starving when I get them back, because he has no food in their fridge and often times, they are sent to bed without food for disobeying him. Every step of the way, I keep trying to fight for my children and get told, there’s nothing I can do until he really fucks up. I get that parents should have equal access to their children. I wish he was an amazing dad to them and none of this would really matter, but I cannot overstep my boundaries as the other parent and tell him how to parent. So I watch him manipulate, brainwash and systematically destroy my little children’s hearts and minds. 

I want to raise alarm to these people who they really hired, but my lawyers say he would be protected because anything I would say is slander and he could sue me for losing his business. Unfortunately for me, just before the affairs were discovered, he started deleting my photos, voice recordings, videos and any notes I had made about the abuse. Really the only proof I have of his abuse was my OBGYN saw trauma to my abdomen from when he kneed me while I was pregnant 2 weeks before my youngest was born. I also have a video of him shaking and screaming at our youngest when she was about 3 months because he was drunk/tired and she wouldn’t stop crying (I was pumping at the time). So it would really be a ’he said, she said’ situation. Granted I have eye witnesses to certain things and they were willing to testify had we had gone to trial. But again, unfortunately for me, this only really could have been brought up in my divorce. I had to end up settling, because as soon as the affairs were discovered, he drained our bank accounts and I was left with only what he was willing to give me in our temporary orders. I was a stay at home mom with no income. My lawyers advised me that the best deal was to take what money I could get, because his ultimate plan was to file for bankruptcy and never let me see a dime of our money. 

I don’t know what to do. He‘s an alcoholic, but he’s functioning. He has 2 Teslas and honestly, he’d probably never get caught with a DUI (one way I know I could get his custody period reduced). I know he would hate Bloomberg from knowing that he is abusive, because there is one reporter there that reports for the company he provides security for that hates him. But then again, I would be in a slander situation. My attorneys tell me to keep my mouth shut and let him be successful and fight for reduction other ways. They’re more worried about the flow of money coming to me and my children. But I keep reminding them that even with all his money, he won’t help me out with our children. The only other thing I would have to wait for is if he hits one of his girlfriends and she is brave enough to stand up to him and call the police when it happens.

I think I have a way to get him criminally charged for the photoshopped documents he submitted in our divorce, but it would have to take a determined detective and DA to go after him. But even then, I don’t know if that would help me reduce his custody period. I feel like I have to wait until he endangers our children by drinking and driving or hits them so bad it can’t be explained away or he hits another woman. It’s all shitty options.

fef4we,Update - I broke up with my abusive live-in ex boyfriend,"I wrote a post a few days ago detailing my situation living with a boyfriend who turned out to be abusive

[https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fctet0/i\_live\_with\_my\_abuser\_and\_two\_friends\_i\_need\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/fctet0/i_live_with_my_abuser_and_two_friends_i_need_to/)

We broke up shortly after. After four days of the silent treatment (literally not saying a word to me) to punish me on top of a verbally abusive and aggressive outburst, we finally spoke. He tried lots of tactics to weaken me and then jump on me and what I'd done to provoke him, and eventually, he broke up with me. He was really surprised when I agreed readily to the breakup, instead of begging him to take me back, and that I'd already moved all my things from his room when he wasn't home.

Straight afterward I felt amazing. I felt like I'd regained all the power I've felt myself losing over the last 9 months, and I felt free. I felt really lucky that I got out early before any more damage could be done to me. I woke up before 12pm for the first time in probably two weeks the next day and was on a high. But then some family stuff happened and it brought me crashing down. I've come to rely on him and I don't have his emotional support in other areas of my life anymore. I'm trying to tell myself that I'm strong enough to get through this alone, and have written a list of all my unhealthy thoughts about him, and corrected them (a technique I learned in CBT for depression). I'm also making a playlist full of songs that make me feel empowered, and I'm not talking to him at all.

I'm kind of worried about retaliation. I feel scared that the more fulfilled and happy I feel, the unhappier he will be to see that. Friends have told me he was asking for advice on how to win me back (although this was one day after the breakup to be fair) and he's voiced fears that I will try to ""get revenge"" for the breakup (probably by being honest about how he treated me). Before we broke up I was scared of the risk of physical violence, and I'm less scared now, but still very anxious about it sometimes.

I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on the situation?",_silly_billy_,2020-03-06 07:35:59,3,431,52.18,28.87,88.82,1,23.94,16.24,93.04,57.08,20.65,16.47,12.06,0.7,0,3.48,0.23,4.18,4.87,16.24,7.89,5.34,6.5,0.93,19.26,7.66,2.55,1.39,1.62,2.78,8.82,2.55,6.26,1.62,1.86,1.86,9.28,0.23,1.16,0,3.94,11.14,2.78,1.16,0.93,3.25,1.16,2.55,3.25,0.23,1.16,1.86,2.09,0,2.09,0,0,9.05,2.78,1.86,3.48,1.62,0.46,7.66,8.35,1.16,15.31,1.16,6.73,7.66,0.7,0.93,1.16,0.46,0,0,1.62,0,1.39,0,0,0,24.83,4.64,2.78,0,0,0.23,0,0.46,0.46,3.25,2.32,10.67
fejt74,Can a non-biological parent file for custody when there is abuse/neglect in the home?,"Here is the situation I was posed:

""I am in an abusive relationship with my child's mother. I want to leave and take my son with me to ensure his safety however currently I have no legal recourse to do so as I am not listed on the birth certificate. His mother has severe mental health problems and is currently unfit to care for him. She frequently leaves him alone in the house when I am at work to go out and get high, creating an unsafe environment for our son when they are left alone together. I am the sole provider for the household and she threatens me all day long that if I don't come home on time or early that she will leave, or hurt herself, or do something to me creating a hostile and unstable environment for our son to grow up in. She frequently attacks me when I get home, physically hitting or kicking me or throwing items at me, and being constantly verbally abusive. This is not an environment I want my son growing up in. As she sometimes snaps and becomes verbally abusive towards him as well, or will just leave for hours making threats that she is going to kill herself if she doesn't get exactly what she wants when she wants it. I know that typically in a situation like this CPS would try to place the child with a blood relative however she lives with her mother who is also not a particularly fit parent and this would not help to remedy the situation and provide a safe and healthy environment for my son.

I'm not sure if there is anything to be done, but I would appreciate any help you could possibly give.

Thank you.""

I know there are options in certain situations but does anyone know specifically what could be done in a situation like this in NYS?

felo16,Dealing with the Fallout of a Loved One's Abuser,"I don't even know where to start. . . But I guess here it goes. I met my girlfriend a few years ago, she was still married at the time, which was not a big deal because I frankly didn't really care that much. We matched well, started to become good friends, ended up meeting her husband, and. . . after a while everything started to slowly unravel. It turned out that he was a violent, narcissistic person, and that she had been a victim for quite a long while, and eventually he nearly choked her to death and broke some of her ribs. A couple of weeks before that, we were at her home, and I saw him ramping up and I told him to stop, and he assaulted me instead.

Thankfully nothing serious happened, but it was a pretty awful experience. He was charged both times, and those cases are currently pending. During this whole time, we had made plans to get her divorced and away from him, and to find a way to protect all of our children from this monster. move in together when everything was said and done, which would require some significant financial planning on our ends, as well as some planning on how child custody and that sort of thing would be. 

After the event where she was nearly killed, an emergency protection order was placed against him, and this was where all of our troubles together began.  We discussed our future plans together, and she agreed that she wanted to have full custodial privileges while he had visitation (I fought against him having any sort of unsupervised visitation, but due to the abusive mental conditioning this was a compromise she was comfortable with.) There's a hearing about whether or not to keep the order in place, and she goes, and says that she maintained the order, much to my relief.  However, when he's been sending her threatening messages and other vile filth (she shows me of her own volition,) I tell her that she needs to contact the police and explain that he's making threats and contacting her in violation of the PO. She says it's not a big deal, and then I say I'll do it then. And that's when I find out that she lied to me about keeping the protection order in place.

I was a little upset that I was lied to about such a crucially important detail, especially when we're planning on buying a house together and keeping things safe for everyone. I offer to help her with the divorce paperwork, since her finances are obliterated due to his financial abuse as well, and she tells me that would be great. She never takes me up on it, even though I asked her to E-mail them to me to look them over so she could be as safe and secure as possible. She conveniently forgot, and I trusted that she did the right thing. Later on, I find the decree on the floor of her vehicle as we are getting ready to turn in for the night, and I start reading it over and discover that she agreed to joint-custody. I talk to her about it, and she says it must have been an accident because she remembers switching the papers beforehand. I'm suspicious because of the previous lie pertaining to the EPO, but I let it go because the guy is going up for a felony and is likely to be seeing the inside of a cell anyway, and at that point her safety apart from him can be secured.

Eventually, a hearing for her ex-husband is coming up, and she is adamant about not sending him to prison. I, of course, am flabbergasted by this, as this is literally her only chance to put him away and obtain full custody of her children to ensure her and their long-term safety. We have a very emotional argument, and eventually I learn that she lied to me about the divorce decree as well, which put me in a very, very, very difficult position.

I told her that she lied to me, twice, in order to protect her abuser, about things that matter a lot to our future plans and that I can no longer trust her to do what is right for US. It was hard to say, because I care about her a lot, and I KNOW that what she wants and what she does are tainted by her years and years and years of hoping that he would get better and stop beating her, emotionally, physically, mentally, and financially. I understand that overcoming that is hard, but that trust that we shared, has been unceremoniously shattered. Needless to say, she went to the hearing anyway prepared to testify against him, supposedly.

I know that being patient is critical, and I understand how difficult it is, but everything we wanted together is at risk because of these things that have happened. I feel angry at him for doing what he has done, how his abuse has caused someone I love to betray me, and how bad things had to get before she realized that she has to stop protecting him from himself at the cost of our relationship. I want to give her time to rebuild the trust that we had, but that time is running out. There are things in motion that were timed specifically based upon the things we had discussed, custody, moving in together, and him being a footnote as opposed to a constant threat to the stability of our lives. She's made concrete steps, like getting a therapist to help her, agreeing that I should be there, and that sort of thing. But I am terrified that she's going to do it again, and as much as we do care about one another, I know that I cannot make her want to heal and be free. She has to do that. I just don't know how to cope with the possibility of her relapsing and/or lying to me again in regards to this. (These are the only things she has ever lied to me about, to my knowledge.)

It's so damn hard, and I want us to be able to move forward. . . but I guess time will tell. :(",Desthr0,2020-03-06 14:42:31,36,1066,29.2,83.31,11.79,22.85,24.23,15.95,93.62,64.17,23.36,15.38,5.16,1.97,0,7.97,0.28,7.97,5.16,14.92,9.57,5.72,9.01,1.03,18.76,4.03,1.78,1.88,0.19,1.5,6.94,3.38,3.56,0.66,2.25,0.09,16.51,0.56,0.38,5.72,2.53,10.51,1.78,1.69,1.41,2.25,1.22,2.53,1.78,0.38,0.94,0.38,0.75,0.09,0.47,0,0,10.32,3.85,0.94,2.81,0.94,2.44,5.91,10.79,1.97,13.79,1.97,6.1,5.53,1.03,0.09,0.19,0.66,0,0.19,0.84,0.09,0.09,0,0.38,0.19,13.88,4.5,6.94,0,0,0,0,0.38,0,1.41,0.56,0.09
fepm7c,Please Help Fund Domestic Violence Documentary: gf.me/u/xptrk4,"Hey everyone,

 We are producing a documentary on women with temporary visas experiencing domestic violence. But we need a small amount of money to cover the cost of accommodation and travel (from Darwin to Sydney Australia) of a survivor so we can tell her story in the doco.   

We're PhD students (scientists and social researchers) who produce audio/video documentaries as a passion project. We're more than happy to do the hours of filming, directing and editing but unfortunately, being students we can't cover the cost of travel and accommodation.

We would appreciate any help from the community. Even small donations would go a long way and would ensure that we bring more attention to such an important topic.

Any surplus money will be donated to Domestic Violence NSW.

fepqt6,My[27F] sisters [29F] ex husband wants to take the kids,"My sister and her ex husband have been through a lot. He cheated on her with multiple women &amp; had a child with another woman. My sister already has low self esteem from abuse &amp; issues from the past. For 2 years she’s been dating this abusive guy (I’ve never seen the abuse but I’m sure it’s happening). After she was divorced she IMMEDIATELY started dating this man. She’s so eager to be with anybody who will “love” her. He’s very cocky and always telling my sister what to do. I do not like him at all.

I believe she’s being abused because whenever I go to pick up my nieces, she stays on the phone with me and when I say “I’m pulling up” she makes my neices (5, 3 and 2 years old) stand outside and she won’t come outside or she’ll just wave her hand through the front door without showing her face. I have asked my nieces have they seen him hit their mom and they said yes and when I ask her she just says that they were arguing and the girls were scared. One day  when we were arguing she even told me to mind my business and even “if” that’s the way her man handles her then that’s just that. I’m really worried about them. 

I guess my sisters ex husband has had the same exact experience with her leaving the kids outside and staying inside when he comes to pick them up. He told me when he complained to her about doing that and questioned her, she said that he can no longer come to her house and she now drops the kids off at his moms. She sits in the car and lets the kids walk to the door. I 100% think she’s hiding bruises. 

Her ex told her he wants full custody of the children and that me and him have been worried about her and the children. My sister flew off the handle and told me she hates me because I put him up to this and she wanted to know why I didn’t tell her I was talking to him. So now I have no contact  with my sister or nieces. The only time I can see them is if they’re at my moms house and my sister isn’t there. 

I am not AT ALL fond of my sister ex husband, especially being that he hurt &amp; disrespected my sister (&amp; is JUST like her new boyfriend minus the physical abuse) so bad that she contemplated suicide and he lowered her self esteem even more. Regardless of that I do agree with him that I’m scared for the kids and for my sister. My sister thinks her ex just wants to make her life worse but I honestly don’t think that’s his intention. He and the rest of the family are just seriously worried about her. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to at all side with my sisters horrible ex husband but I don’t want my nieces seeing this abuse and nor do I want my sister getting beat. 

I would really like some advice, is it wrong that I kind of agree that her ex husband should get full custody until she leaves this guy ???",miralake,2020-03-06 19:58:17,1,561,11.46,89.38,9.17,1.92,20.04,11.76,95.19,61.14,26.2,21.57,9.45,0.36,0,10.52,1.25,4.63,4.1,11.05,10.34,6.24,7.84,2.32,20.14,3.21,1.25,1.78,1.07,1.43,5.7,1.43,4.28,1.07,1.78,0.53,26.38,5.17,0.71,11.59,5.17,9.45,1.43,1.43,2.14,1.78,1.43,2.5,2.32,0.89,0.89,0.36,0.89,0.36,0.36,0,0,8.2,4.81,0.36,1.78,0.71,0.71,4.81,13.37,1.25,12.3,2.5,5.53,4.63,0.18,0.18,0.89,0.18,0,0.18,1.96,0,0,0.53,0,0,14.62,4.63,0.89,0,0.71,0.53,0,0,1.07,4.1,1.07,1.6
feqgj1,No history of domestic violence EVER in 4 years...,"My sons father and I have been together for 4 and a half years. We have a 1 year old son together. 
My sons father saved me from myself when I was a lowly drug addict with no support no one to give a shit enough about me to even tell me I need to stop or even acknowledge that I was not only fucking up my life but that I’m actually FUCKED. 
He flushed my stuff down the toilet one day and told me it’s him or the stuff, and if I choose him and he still finds out I’m on the stuff he wishes me the best but wants nothing to do with me. 
(Still sober from that day on) 
3 years later we find out I’m 8 weeks pregnant. 
I was nervous he didn’t “like me like that” but we’ve been together a while at this point we know each other very well we are very much in love and he’s excited. 
5 months pregnant he cheats on me with a woman. I find him naked in a different girls bed down the street from our home after 15 hours of frantically searching for him calling hospitals jails friends ect. 
A mutual friend tipped me off and let me into the home only to find him naked in that girls bed (girl no where to be found) 
We separate. I break up with him in disgusted in shock overwhelmed. 
3 months go by (8 months pregnant now having baby soon) we stay in contact as I update him on baby growth I forgive him he goes above &amp; beyond things are as they should have been although I carry resentment I don’t show it. 
Fast forward to Jan of 2020 I find out my “husband” is in fact having sex with a MAN 
He denies it initially, has some back cover story” 
I get screen shots of messages he can no longer deny involvement at this point. He says it was one time he got his dick sucked. I don’t believe it. I receive more screen shots like literally 100 at least from his “mister” ( is that a male mistress) 
He had been having an affair with a man whom is a mutual friend of ours in my home with my son present for the past 6 months while I’m at work.... 
I get admitted to the pshyc ward because of attempted suicide and total my car. My son is with my mother. 
He visits me in the hospital. I get out &amp; go to my mothers out of town where my son is with her. 
I stay a week he convinces me he it’s done it was due to stress pressure, curiosity but it’s over. 
I go home with my son the next day to his house. 
Last night he doesn’t come home. I’m at home with my son and my friend who has a daughter the same age as my son. They’re fast asleep we are both awake waiting to see if he’s going to make it home made all the rounds with phone calls he’s unfindable if you will. 
At 3Am a  vehicle I don’t know turns into my drive way I see a driver and passenger I don’t know at all, my “husband” gets out the back seat he has brass knuckles on 
I panic I tell my friend go inside now get the babies go upstairs. 
Doors is locked 
He lunges for the window I try to lock it and it doesn’t work he breaks the blinds down half way in the home half way outside I push him out and close the window on his arm. He takes his arm out I lock it he kicks down the door my friend is calling 911 at this point he pushes me to ground I can not catch myself she hangs up the phone helps me up. 
I get back on my feet I’m knocked down 3x and get back up each time to stall so my friend can take the babies up stairs and lock the door.
Suddenly I’m in a choke hold and he’s just punching me over and over and over on the same side of the head when I see a red dot on my chest his chin and the stair case. I don’t know how I got out of his grip I run to the front door and yell I’m opening the door my hands are up please don’t shoot there’s babies in here. I’m knocked to the ground by and officer face down in the dirt cuffed immediately. My “husband” throws the blinds under the couch runs up stairs and changes clothes while he’s in the closet I’m still face down in the dirt the police are now in my home with guns drawn. 
He comes out they cuff him immediately bring him outside they run my name no warrants clear help me up I cuff me and start asking me what the hell is going on I point to broken door foot print on door broken window &amp; blinds he says nothing. 
Officers ask me how I acquired injuries I wasn’t even aware I had visible marks bruises scratches and knots. 
He had nothing. 
He is arrested for assault that causes bodily injury I don’t press charges or write a statement, for fact I was in an emotional state of shock. 
Police press charges because of that they witnessed and evidence of forced entry with intent to harm. 

He was so drunk and fucked up and acting so crazy had a crazy look in his eyes. No light no soul unrecognizable to me. 

After he goes to jail I receive intel screenshots and word from a  fellow bartender ( I work at a bar as well we all remain in contact with each other because we’re neighboring bars) 
My “husband” was having sex with a man in the restroom at the bar my friend works at. 
It was so loud that everyone could hear it and when the door was attempted to be opened it was closed by a foot but not before 3 people saw them literally fucking 

I find this out at 2pm today, 
I have asked him if he’s gay or bi since the affair he denies both. 
He comes home in a drunken raid with intent to harm and then after the ordeal happens I find out about the bathroom incident that I occurred prior to him coming home. 

I think “my husband” is gay. I think he is ashamed embarrassed and can not admit it himself let alone others. 
I think I was a cover up for his insecurity with sexuality. I think after I got pregnant he panicked because now this shit just got real real life. He has to suddenly be a father provide for a child, for me as it gets closer to due date and post partum I think he has developed this drinking habit because he can not handle the pressures of his daily life and he acts out in extreme circumstances. 
I am not making excuses I am simply trying to understand what flipped the switch from totally “seemingly” normal straight relationship and then baby comes into the picture and the man I’ve known for 3 years is suddenly an abusive alcoholic homo or bi or pan sexual stranger?",theAliengirlwithBPD,2020-03-06 21:01:46,1,1242,54.62,52.25,87.62,4.51,25.35,10.95,91.47,57.33,20.13,16.51,9.66,0.97,0.08,5.39,0.4,3.62,6.12,14.9,8.13,3.86,5.96,2.25,15.78,3.46,1.77,0.89,1.69,1.05,3.54,0.72,2.82,0.89,1.05,0.24,14.65,2.42,1.05,0.81,7.17,7.89,2.5,1.29,0.72,1.13,1.05,2.42,2.42,1.45,0.56,0.4,4.67,1.77,1.45,1.61,0.56,7.89,2.74,0.72,3.3,1.37,0.08,3.22,12.24,0.72,19.48,2.98,11.27,6.04,0.64,0.64,2.42,0,0.16,0.08,0.97,0.81,0,0,0.16,0,10.39,4.27,0.56,0,0.24,0.08,0,0,1.37,2.82,0.81,0.24

ferbb2,My 18 year old sister will not leave her abusive boyfriend - LONG STORY,"I need in help in trying to convince my sister to leave this relationship! 
She started dating this boy 18 who wasn’t originally from the community but had mutual friendships with our family. (Our community is very close and everyone is basically connected or related in someway) 
So I initially knew of him through my cousin (1) who I worked with, she always hung out with him etc. So basically they were a thing, but then it kind of broke off because she told me that he was on ICE (meth). As I didn’t even know the guy I was like oh that sucks, plus ICE use is very common in my community. 
I then found out he was dating my other cousin (2) (close friendship with my sister), she was a drug user as well. That’s when I learned that he was abusive because she came out and told people this. 
But then he started dating my sister, so you could imagine my reaction to this. This then started a major conflict with cousin (2), online bullying posts about sloppy seconds
And asking why would you want to be with a crack head woman basher etc. etc. 
Eventually this was a foundation of mistrust, my sister thinking he would go back to cousin 2. As the weeks went on my sister basically moved out into his caravan that was parked behind the family house who looked after him, she lost weight due to heavy drug use (party drugs mostly), she had no money all time (even though she worked full time, and didn’t pay rent, bills, groceries). 
So basically she’s going down hill. 
THEN I found out that she posted on her private Instagram of her concerns that he was becoming abusive towards her (she stated that he scruffed her because he was paranoid she was texting under the blanket) she dismissed this as “I guess it wasn’t his fault he was off his head” (btw all they did was take pills in the caravan and lay around). 
I became suspicious to the fact that she might have tried ICE with him (my sister is easily influenced). 
This was a major thing especially to the fact my eldest sister was a heavy drug user eg ice heroin and 2 years prior she attempted to murder my mother while I was at school. 
This angered me because it was a massive slap in the face for me and my mum. That this world of ice is impacting our life again. 
She then turned 18, she put on this party out the road in a hall, basically was a drug fest. As she was high on ketamine, she kissed another boy. (Yes her boyfriend was at the party) 
They had a fight he kicked her out of the caravan. 
My sister then told our older cousins at work about him and how he scruffed her. She also contacted the family where he was staying in the caravan. SHE TOLD THEM HE WAS SMOKING CRACK IN THE CARAVAN AMD TOLD THEM WHERE HE KEEPS HIS PIPE. 
She is now back at home, THIS JUST RAISED MY SUSPICION MORE. Also during this time her behaviour was jacked -she had no memory of conversations and acted with paranoia. Also hanging around community members known for harbouring and dealing ice. As I didn’t want a massive fight to break out I was working with our cousin (3) to speak to her (they were very close, tell each other everything) 
My sister would deny deny deny, even turned on cousin (3) for insinuating she does crack and tried to convince her the boyfriend quit a long time ago. I could see right through also I knew he was on ice the year prior. Also he was best friends with 3 guys I knew from high school that were convicted users and traffickers. 
So now my sister used this accusation in a mocking way, because it was so shocking! Anyone who didn’t know the inside scoop would also be like SHE WOULD NEVER DO CRACK WTF LIES! 
Anyway, our older male cousins were furious and threatened to get the boyfriend as they also knew he was abusive to cousin (2). My sister pleaded with them no no I was lying and then turned on them. She then told our cousins she broke up with him just to deflate the situation. She also told our brothers but the next day shut them out, and made my mum turn on them as well. She then complained about how everyone was chiming in but forgot she was the one who told these people. 
Our cousins drove passed our house and saw his car in our driveway and screamed out something. My sister then cut them off fully. 
I then started talking to my mum further, I was trying to give her hints about what’s happening but I didn’t want to overwhelm her because she has gone through extreme trauma (from DV) and has PTSD. Me hinting would set her off, she didn’t want to hear it. Plus she didn’t see what I saw, which made it hard. 
They are now both living at home, she is always miserable, never leaving the room, room is a pigsty etc. 
they are always fighting and hitting each other, she stated that she doesn’t think it’s a big deal because he hits because she hits him right back. All done within the walls of her room. 
I keep telling my mum this isn’t right, I think he on ice. She obviously doesn’t know what to do. Tension became overwhelming in the house, I started staying at my Nan’s house just to escape it. 
One time we borrowed his car ( I always told mum aren’t you scared driving this car? You don’t know who is after him ) this was a genuine concern. WHICH THEN BECAME REAL. We were parked behind the supermarket and when we came out this dodgy ute (truck) was parked all the behind us, bumper to bumper. It had all this bikie stickers and sayings on it. I just rolled my eyes. The guy came out and was like “where is he” and we are like wtf. My mum was like fuck this shit and rang my sister to get her man on the phone. So they are talking and the  sketchy dude is asking for his money and asking for the car back. The dude explained that my sister’s boyfriend didn’t own the car or the tyres and owed the guy 1000$. My mind was like ~clearly drug related~.
I thought this was it! Like my mum and sister are gonna get this bloke out of the house. 
No. 
And I don’t know why. 
Next thing we know, my sister ends up in hospital. She tried to OD on Panadol. 
I couldn’t believe it, I was like what is it actually going to take. I’m hearing different stories, she was drinking with her close friend and then she took her hospital. Few days after I still didn’t know what happened. I concluded this was a massive cry for help, I don’t think she wanted to die, because honestly if she did she would. She had access to pills, ket and stronger stuff. But she went with Panadol? Remind you, she denies she does drugs, so I also thought that’s why she chose Panadol. I didn’t want to think it but I kind of thought it was a cry for help and guilt because she probably did use ice with him. And I did say to my self and cousin 3 if I found out she did use it , she’s done. 
So then I found out, her story she had told to staff and friends. She alleged her suicide attempt was because of our family and that everyone picks on her. This was SO UNTRUE, honestly our family is riddled with trauma and pain but in THIS MOMENT how could it not be her boyfriend that fuelled her attempt. My sister always used this angle, that her siblings bully her. I don’t know about the others my I gave her nothing but love. But when she became more difficult, I became more harsh, in the sense of becoming more blatant. I would never bully her ever. I just gave her it’s this way or the highway tone. 
I was confused also, that with this attempt she never told any of her reasonably good friends about it, she told people that had no friendship or relationships with, just acquaintances. 
I just thought maybe because she’s not telling the truth? Maybe her true ~friends~ would know maybe it was because of her boyfriend. 
Fast forward, I learn that her BF was the one who picked her up from the hospital. She then  went out the following night, seeking drugs with him. 
At this moment of time it’s a massive WTF and I give up. Also by the fact her closer friends were questioning why is she back with him, her answer was I don’t want to go home. And stating things like I wish her BF did get bashed by our cousins. This was very much a personal attack, how can that piece of shit of a boy be better than being at home with your family. 
Time goes by and she’s doing crazy shit. They all were drinking and they went driving in his car, she was took over and crashed and rolled the car. She gave her friend the biggest gash down her temple. My sister is so stubborn she cannot admit to her bad decisions. I was pissed off, she could of died and killed her friend? But she turned it into a funny story to tell and brag about (no doubt led by her BF) she even admitted she had nightmares for days over it. 
That situation escalated, when learning the car was due to be destroyed by the police due to the BF being caught under the influence of drugs and also unlicensed couple months prior. She came home and said it was from speeding, nothing about the car being impounded. 
Her behaviour is so reckless - she can’t see it though. 
Next episode they have a fist fight out the front while heading downtown to the pub, I go off at her. I asked her to get the piece of shit out of the house, she was laughing while our nan was freaking out in the spare room. She even went to leave to go to the pub and I said what you gonna have a domestic and then leave us here with him? She said he is a pussy.
Next day she puts all his bags and clothes out the front. I was thinking ok maybe this thing is over. She’s celebrating and joking, she then says he’s been awake all night probably on crack. I was like wtf, because how many times does she deny that. I go to dinner come back that evening, he is back in the house. It only lasted a full 5 hours.
I was pissed again like wtf, all she could do is laugh. His behaviour was also strange, following her into the kitchen and bathroom literally 20cm between them. 
I share my disbelief with my mum, but I know nothing is going to come of it. I’m frequently staying with my nan now. Home is a nightmare. 
Late last year she gained most her wait back on and things died down. I thought maybe everything is smoothing out but I knew obviously something is going to happen. She became more vocal to our cousin (3) about leaving him and not loving him anymore. She was clearly aware of the things that were wrong. She was sick of going to work, spending all her money, coming back to a messy room, his paranoia. 
I have recently moved out, she took my room. Last night they were heading out, drinking and doings drugs (she even sent me an accidental snap) I woke this morning to texts saying what happened to my sister. I WAS LIKE WTF. They had a physical fight at the bar, in front of everyone. She was catching up with some male friends for school. He became jealous and pushed her around and everyone came to intervene. She then posted on Facebook asking where her family are and why aren’t they helping her. That she is sick of missing work because of him and that she even tried to kill her self over him. 
How can I help her? 
What do I do? When I know what is say is going over her head? 
I know 100% he will be back tonight or tomorrow. 
How can I make her realise that she won’t lose nothing leaving him! HOW HOW HOW HOW HOW 
Before it is too late.

fex8dx,"i suspect an online friend i've never met of being abused by her husband, what do i do?","i, a 36 yo man with a girlfriend, started chatting with a 30 yo married woman a while ago from a chat app. both her husband and my girlfriend know we chat, so it's not some secret relationship.

 she was very closed-off (as most are when they chat with a stranger) but after noticing how kind and caring i had been towards her, she began to open up. i shouldn't say too much but let's just say that she had a very PAINFUL childhood. now she's depressed and occasionally causes self-harm. me continuing to be so caring and kind to her made her open up so much that she even wanted to talk on the phone during a moment of sadness and before i even agreed, she gave me her phone number. after we hung up, she gave me her Facebook, Instagram and youtube links, so i know she's NOT some con artist scamming me from behind a screen. at one point we were amazed to learn that we actually live in the same state, just a few hours apart.

now, here's where my suspicion and worry begins

recently she told me that her husband yelled at her, grabbed her. she begged him not to hit her. i asked if he hurts her. she said no but i carefully pushed a tad bit more in case she was just scared but she said no again and swore to me he never has.

 just last night he sent her through text (while he was just in the other room) an ""artistic"" photoshopped image of a man seeming to have cut his own hand off. she was disgusted by it and when she went to talk to him, he had gone to sleep and she refused to wake him. i'm no expert on signs of abuse but that seems like psychological abuse to me, like he's subtlety ENCOURAGING her to do more self-harm

so. are my suspicions valid? if yes, what can i do? what i CAN'T do is ask her to leave him and stay with me. and i don't want to upset her because honestly, i rarely get to leave my house and have no offline and very few online friends. I'm not lying about the last part",erehemanresrumodnar,2020-03-07 08:14:55,0,399,22.93,82.32,18.13,2.87,19,10.78,94.74,61.15,22.06,19.3,7.02,1.25,0,10.78,0.25,2.76,4.51,13.03,8.02,7.27,8.27,3.26,17.54,4.26,2.76,1.75,0.75,3.01,6.52,2.01,4.51,1.25,1.25,0.75,22.06,1,1,8.27,4.01,9.77,2.76,1,1.25,2.01,0.5,3.76,3.26,0.5,1.75,1,1.25,0.75,0.5,0,0,7.52,5.51,0,1.5,0.25,0.25,6.52,11.28,0,14.04,1.75,6.02,6.52,0.5,2.01,0.5,0,0,0,1,0,0.75,0.25,0,0,14.29,4.26,4.01,0,0,0.75,0,0.75,0.5,3.01,1,0
ff1m35,Understanding/coping with first experience of DV within my family,"Hello everyone, new to this sub but I've been reading up as much as I can about DV since earlier this week, when I found out a family member's husband was arrested for DV.

At least for me, (cant speak for other family members) but I was shocked he was abusing her. Maybe I'm not experienced enough with relationships to see it, but it was a huge surprise to me.

I found out that she was being hit for a year and a half before she told anybody, and there was emotional abuse/manipulation going on before this. The hitting started when their first child was born. My family member is (very) pregnant again with their second child, so the safety of their unborn child (and other child!) is something I'm very concerned about as well. 

The turning point for the arrest was the choking. He hit her, she ran into the other room and he chased her, started choking her and would not give her phone back so she could call the police and have him arrested. She grabbed their child and was able to run out and have a neighbor call 911. 

I was reading here and will continue to read here to cope and for support. The choking scares me so much.  I was reading a post on here that suggests evidence that choking has a high chance of escalating into homicidal behavior. That is so scary to me! 

I am also afraid, because mental illness runs in our family (myself included) and I know from experience that having a mental illness can sometimes lead to illogical, self destructive and victimizing thought patterns and I dont want my family member being taken advantage by him of because of this. For example, she has a RO but also bailed him out when he would have spent time in jail for the arrest. The psychology behind that scares me! I really really hope that she never contacts him again but I know that it is common to go back to someone.

Any advice or encouragement on how to cope with a family member dealing with something so awful would be amazing.

ff5jqy,What do I want from the court?,"A couple days ago my court services rep (not lawyer, but someone assigned by the city to explain the court process for assault cases) asked me what the best outcome for this case would be, in my opinion.  I'm still trying to figure out what I want.  My boyfriend was charged for 2 counts of sexual assault and 1 count each of assault, unlawful confinement, and threatening to kill me.

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, there was over a year of rape, which occurred every month to every two weeks.  Sometimes those were done in addition to physical assault.  Also, he didn't pay rent for almost a  year and owes me maybe 20k.  

&amp;#x200B;

But on the other hand, I believe he can get better with proper therapy and lots of work.  Will he do the work?  Maybe, maybe not.  But I don't believe that jail time or a criminal record will help.  We are Canadian and Canadians with records have trouble crossing the border, and he has family in the US so I don't want to deprive him of that.  Also, a criminal record could affect his future job prospects because he wants to work in finance.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if they do this in real life, but are there court-mandated therapy, anger management, and consent classes?  Or is that just on TV?  Should I be so concerned about the criminal record?  After all, he did break the law, many times.  Can I ask for the money he owes me?

ffh3uk,How to help my sister?,"First, I'm sorry it's long and for mistakes in my writing. 

I'm currently unemployed and living with my parents. I've been here for almost a year to do some personal project and I stay mostly at home to save money. My sister (31) married a man 2 years ago to a man I don't like because I learned that he got caught buying drugs by the police, I was there when my sister got the call and she was crying so much. I never liked the guy, he was always fake and seemed like hiding something. After they got married, because he was working far away they didn't live together and my sister lived with my parents for about a year. My parents then let them live in an apartment they owned. My parents are retired, my other siblings and I didn't want my sister to live there without paying rent because it was one of their source of income. 

My sister had schizophrenia paranoia that she refused to accept and reluctant to go to the doctor and my parents doesn't know how to deal with it. And she had other issues that make me sympathize to her attitude and problems with my parents. My parents aren't horrible but were very religious, controlling, and negative. My oldest sibling and I moved abroad from a young age (separately) so we were able to 'wake up' but my sister didn't go and not able to take responsibilities for her action and keep blaming everyone else for her circumstances. 

Current problem is the husband. Overtime I learned that he was in debt before they got married. My sister paid for it and after their marriage my sister pays for everything, even her giving birth. This man doesn't care about her or anyone except for the baby because it brings him opportunity to get something from his own family. He has a lot of debts he won't tell my sister that my sister is paying. he smoked around her when she was pregnant, he's always disrespectful to my parents and when he stayed at my parents' house because they don't have a house, they're currently mooching off and staying in his sister's house, telling my sister to leave her job ( which is fine if they want to focus on the baby but she had been paying his debt and he told her to just stop coming to the office without saying anything) , now my sister is stuck with him. 

It's something that transpire over months so we had been trying to help her to talk about legal stuff for divorce, helping her to go to someone she can talk to for her mental health, taking care of her baby and she chooses him. She never asked to be helped about her marriage, she just kept complaining and being hurt so I helped. My parents didn't see it before and was protecting the husband (he's two-faced). I had to shout and pushed my parents until they finally see how bad her husband is. 

I'm so hurt by her action because I know that guy doesn't care about her or our family and talks badly about our family but for my sister to accept that, I start to wonder if she's actually as bad. I did everything to help her, I don't know what she wants. I thought she wanted to divorce him, she agrees with everything - that he was using her and she knows she's being used. I don't understand this, she knows, she agreed when we talk about it, she finally got my parents support in leaving him. I have loved her and see her positively but I don't want know if I  can believe her heart anymore. So I've been distancing myself from her. I admit, I think I'm too harsh in my approach but I'm so frustrated and scared by the situation. 

So far there's no physical abuse but even from the beginning he was able to talk badly about my sister in front of my parents, talking about how she had to change herself and using words like crazy because he knew about her schizo, he also told my parents he wanted to put camera to record their interaction so he could show my parents that my sister was the one who starts every arguments. 

I don't know what I can do. I'm so tired by everything but worried if I let it go it will be too late to help her.

ffhj0t,He took the guns and 2 kids,"Hello
First I want to say, I am am coming here for advise. I am not posting for comments on my friends character. We all make mistakes and we are actively trying to make it better

I met my best friend in high school when she started dating my brother. They had two kids together and she left him after a couple years. They could not get along and he has substance abuse issues. We remained best friends. She is an amazing mother. She works hard to provide for her children. 6 years she started dating a guy who seemed all right. He seemed good to my nieces and nephews. They moved in together and had 2 more children. He was always nice when I was around. Later I found out that he was a convicted felon of violent crimes. Had beaten a man and paralyzed him. I do believe he has hit my friend but she stayed with him, bc 2 incomes are better than one and they have 4 children to feed (her thoughts). I know she feels trapped. She just called me. She said she married him a few months back. Then proceeds to tell me that he took 2 guns that are registered in my friends name. And he also took their 2 children. He stole all the cash out of her wallet($1100). Fortunately my friends father says they can stay with him, but she doesn’t want to go over their til she gets her 2 youngest children back. She has no money for a lawyer and I’m thinking about talking with my husband to let her barrow money for a retainer. I directed her to a good lawyer in town who takes payments to get an urgent ex parte. She took tomorrow off to set up her own bank account and hopefully she will contact that lawyer. Has anyone experience a situation similar to this. Has anyone here had to file an ex parte for custody.",eewwedavid,2020-03-08 12:23:27,5,339,39.21,97.21,3.4,64.91,12.11,14.75,90.56,54.28,22.42,19.47,5.9,0.88,0,10.62,2.06,2.95,4.13,11.8,7.96,3.54,5.6,1.18,18.88,4.72,2.95,1.18,3.54,1.77,4.42,3.24,1.18,0,0.88,0,26.84,2.06,2.36,7.08,5.9,8.26,2.36,0.88,1.47,1.77,1.18,1.47,1.77,0,0.88,0.59,0.59,0,0.29,0,0.29,14.45,5.31,2.36,4.42,4.42,0,6.78,10.32,1.47,12.39,1.47,6.19,5.9,2.95,0,0,2.06,0,0,0.88,0,0.29,0,0,0,10.91,7.96,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.59,1.18,0.29

ffot0h,I called the police on my friends husband and the backlash is bad.,"My friend has been in a DV relationship for years. She has consistently called me and sent me photos of her injuries throughout their whole relationship. I urged her to leave, would provide her with resources that she said she would look into, then a week later everything was fine between them. Last Monday, she called me saying she had to leave. I asked her what happened and she explained to me he had punched her in the stomach, face, head and then strangled her. When we got off the phone, I asked her to send me photos and they were horrific. The finger marks on her neck were so visible and her face was extremely swollen. I told her to call the police but she said she was going to talk to an advocate instead. I spent the day ruminating about it, wondering what I should do. I talked to her later that evening and of course, everything was fine again and she wasn’t going to reach out for help. I hit MY breaking point. I called the police. I sent them the photos. He was arrested and charged with four felonies. 

Now, I’m dealing with the backlash. She told me to die slowly, along with various other names. Her mother has even defended her husband and helped bail him out of jail and is speaking incredibly poorly about me. I might have to testify if he goes to trial, and I don’t know if I can do that. I’m terrified to face so many people that are so angry with me. 

I know what I did was right. I know I potentially saved her life but this is so much worse than I could have imagined. And the worst part is, I was a domestic violence advocate for 7 years. Why am I regretting this so much? Any advice? Words of encouragement?",waitwaitk,2020-03-08 20:53:23,41,327,22.56,77.77,12.4,5.86,12.58,14.37,92.05,60.86,24.46,20.49,10.4,0.31,0,8.56,1.22,3.98,4.59,11.93,11.01,4.28,7.65,0.61,21.1,3.36,1.83,1.53,0.61,2.14,3.67,0.92,2.75,0.31,0.31,0.31,20.8,0.92,0.61,7.65,1.83,7.95,1.83,0.31,2.14,1.83,0.92,2.45,3.36,1.53,1.53,0.31,3.06,2.45,0.92,0,0,5.81,2.75,0.31,1.53,0.31,1.22,9.79,9.17,1.83,10.09,2.75,3.06,4.59,1.53,0,0.31,0.61,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.84,7.03,3.67,0,0,0.92,0,0,0,1.22,0,0
ffrzo5,Why am I having nightmares years later?,"I was with my abusive ex for 3 years. He was abusive in every way possible. Mentally, sexually, verbally, emotionally, and sometimes physically.

I tried tow leave multiple times but of course he didn’t make it easy. 

He’d threaten to kill himself. He stalked me. Harassed me. 

I blocked his number, he’d call with a block number; over and over and over again. (I’d have up to 500 missed calls a night). I block his email, He’d make a new one and blast me with crude, heart breaking emails containing insults. Was called every name in the book &amp; then some. (Stick and stones..)

After many attempts to leave on my own, it always end the same. At one point I gave up as I remembered feeling like my life was harder without him than with him (he made sure of that) 

It took the help of a friend and the cops for me to get out. I still can’t believe I’m out and I’m forever grateful. 

Weeks and months following the breakup, I felt fine. I looked at it as a new start and had a positive outlook on life. 

But a year to 2 years later I started to get paranoid. I’d feel like he was around watching me (as he often did) 

One time in Walmart I saw his doppelgänger and I couldn’t breathe. My heart dropped and I just wanted to die. I managed to leave without attracting attention to myself. 

More recently, I’ve been having vivid nightmares of him. Tonight is the 2nd or 3rd time it’s happened. (I can’t recall) 

The nightmares are months apart. They wake me in the middle of the night, leave me in uncontrollable tears, hot, with shortness of breath. I’m unable to return to sleep. I can’t move. I feel like I’m being watched and I fear for my life. 

I know I’m paranoid. But why now? I thought I was healing nicely. 

Why is my brain doing this to me 3 years later?",aliho001,2020-03-09 02:15:47,0,342,52.21,15.3,96.84,3.47,10.36,15.5,91.81,54.68,20.18,18.13,13.16,0,0,4.68,0.29,2.05,4.68,15.5,9.65,2.63,5.85,2.05,19.59,5.56,4.68,0.88,2.05,1.75,7.02,2.34,4.68,1.46,1.75,0.58,8.48,0,0.29,0,4.68,11.7,2.92,1.75,0.58,1.46,1.75,3.51,3.22,1.46,0,1.75,3.8,2.05,1.46,0.29,0,4.97,0.88,0.58,2.63,1.17,0.29,7.31,9.06,0.58,17.84,1.75,6.43,9.65,0.88,0.29,0,0,0,0.58,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,22.51,9.06,3.8,0,0.58,0.88,0,0,0,4.97,2.92,0.29
ffsfl5,Tips on Recording someone - Domestic Violence issues (gathering evidence),"I know this post has two places it could possibly go, one being here, the other one over in the Legal section because it's pretty much about gaining verbal recorded evidence, and I need some help if I may ask. I can even delete this post if need be and post it in the other section if required. 

To give you some hindsight, I live at home with a very abusive, manipulative, rather controlling family member, who on the odd occasion, has made it clear that she will ""run a knife through me"". There was an incident a month or so back where things got super abusive, I left the house went on a walk for about an hour or so called the police, in the end they attended my place and spoke with the person making the threats .. since I live at home with them they basically did nothing and told me to move out .. 

Which is exactly what I'm trying to do, BUT, after that happened she has made it clear that if the cops are called to the house again, that she will pick up a knife and run me through .. I have a slim MP3 device that I have recently bought to capture this on, so what would be the best way to approach it, so that when time comes, and I decide to take out a restraining order on this individual, what will the authorities accept and not ?

ffu2kq,Tonight,"I am at home now, but am scared and shaken. 

I live with my sister. We work together. I got involved with a man 20 years older than me. We work together. No one knows about it but we have been ""dating"" for 10 months. I had a key to his place. We said we love eachother. He has been very manipulative. I know he has followed me. I don't know if he knows where I live now. We just moved. He knows where my ex and I used to live. He knows where my sister and I work since we all work together. We have had a rough ""relationship"" with a lot of trust issues. He has given me reason to believe that he was cheating. While he was asleep, I made the stupid choice to take his phone and leave. I saw he was talking to a lot of women-one who he said was his ex but from reading texts she still believes they are together. He was having sex with a lot of women. When I got back, he was outside. I ran inside to get my stuff and leave his phone. My stuff was not there. He ran in and started pushing me, holding me down, pulling my hair, hit me in my face telling me to give him his phone. It felt numb but there is only a scratch on the inside from my tooth hitting my lip where he hit me. He almost threw me down the stairs. I gave him his phone. I told him to give me my stuff. He said give me his key. I took it off the keyring and said give me my stuff and I will give you your key. He chased me around outside and a neighbor saw us. He grabbed a big rock and made holes and dents on my car and tried to bust the windows. I recorded him while he had the rock but my phone died before I could get footage of him hitting my car. He finally showed me where my stuff was and when I was grabbing it the key fell somewhere. He told me to find it while he kept hitting my car. I had the chance to run for my car and he chased me. I drove off while he ran and continued trying to bust the windows and hit my car. Even when I waited for the gate to open. While I was driving I called the number of the ""long distance girlfriend"" who has been manipulated just like I have. He was visiting her a couple times a month while we were together. I called her twice. She didnt answer. and he called me to say that I am calling numbers from his phone now. I said no. I think she called him and told him my number called her phone because we are from the same area in Nevada. I stopped calling her. I called him and told him we need to figure out how we are going to proceed since we work together and that we both need to stay away from eachother. He said he called the cops because I stole his property and sensitive information and that they will be at my work in the morning. He knows what time I work. I am scared. I know he has stalked me. He knows what I drive. I dont know if he will try to follow my sister. She doesnt know about anything. I am scared I will get in trouble with the police for taking his phone. I took pics of what I saw in his texts but deleted it all. What do I do?

(The one girl he dated in between ended up filing a police report against him but she broke it by talking to him again) I used to be bigger because I was a D1 athlete and was incredible strong, he told me at the time years ago I’d be a model if I didn’t have a fucked up chin and if my legs and stomach were smaller. I hated him after that. His best friend was my best friend as well and he was there for me through the breakup, we ended up having sex three times in a few month span. And I did something really fucked up but I didn’t like or respect my ex bf and he wasn’t in my life anymore and never thought he would be again.
Fast forward two years ago, I started getting really sick and got diagnosed with Crohns Disease, we hadn’t talk in months and he somehow wiggled his way into my life and he changed and became the best man and boyfriend I could ask for. He asked me multiple times if I had sex with his friend and I said no for fear of him losing his best friend and his friend and me agreed to just leave it in the past. For the last 1.5 years it’s ate me alive and I was never able to fully love him properly because of the lie. It got to the point I refused to lie to him, and the man he became deserves the truth. 

So I told him, and it ended up snatching my beanie from my head and him pushing me down then again when I was on the ground screaming at me. He’s calling me every name in the book like disgusting Whore, filthy slut etc, and then the next day he found something else out and that’s when I’m confused. 

HERES THE PART IM CONFLICTED OVER


So I had a blanket over my face as he was screaming and he ripped it away and pushed me backwards while pinning me to the ground screaming “you better fucking tell me what else you fucking slut” and I just told him everything I could think of just to make sure I didn’t miss something. Then he called me a Whore  He then slapped me lightly on the cheek enough it was kinda red, and I had bruises on my wrists. Granted I did this, I told him. I used to be a slut but since changed my whole life around. Later he said he went to snatch my bun and “ I moved my head so I need to stop saying he slapped me” I then once again just kept getting called filthy worthless Whore and stuff but I just brushed it off even when after wards he said “if I find out you lied I’m going into that kitchen and stabbing you multiple times and I don’t care what happens to me” when he calmed down he apologized for saying that and said he didn’t mean it, he told me it won’t happen again unless he ever finds out I cheated, and that he doesn’t apologize for anything. I stayed at his place for a month taking all the degrading, shameful words and I believe still it’s my fault cause he’s said so many times if I didn’t do that none of this would have happened to me, and he still thinks I’m the Abuser here and told me again this is my fault. I took time yesterday and knew if we kept having sex with him looking at me as a whore neither of us will heal since sex caused this. I asked him for us to take a month break so we can rebuild our relationship emotionally and gain trust back, but he told me “if I’m not getting your p$$$y you’re not cuddling me or getting my lips” and “No guys okay with just staying at second base”
“ I’m 23 and live alone I can be getting bitches now” I really want to try and work on getting us back to how we were, but he said again none of this is on him. And I don’t know if he’s right and I should just let it go because what I did in jun 2018 was awful. My best friend who is his cousin is even telling me to leave and it’s not right, but I don’t know if this is really abuse because it’s warranted for the situation right?",rainb0wfissh,2020-03-09 07:56:32,10,860,11.94,35.05,77.74,2.39,34.4,11.51,93.95,62.79,24.42,19.42,11.4,1.16,0.7,6.16,0,5,4.07,11.4,9.65,5.35,10.7,2.79,20.12,3.95,1.98,1.05,1.63,1.4,7.09,2.21,4.88,0.47,1.4,0.58,14.65,0.12,1.51,0.23,6.98,11.16,1.74,1.63,1.98,2.33,1.28,4.77,1.98,0.23,1.51,0.23,4.53,1.05,1.28,1.74,0.35,9.77,3.26,1.51,3.37,2.21,0.93,8.84,8.49,0.93,15.81,1.86,7.21,7.56,0.47,0.23,0.12,0,0,0.12,2.09,1.4,0.35,0.12,0.12,0,11.86,2.56,2.56,0,0,0.35,0,0,1.4,3.49,1.16,0.35

fg0v6i,I am incredibly depressed today,"I thought I finally got an opportunity to at least get back home to my family for next month. He promised my mom that he was buying a plane ticket so that I could see my family. I was so excited but obviously it was all a damn lie. He told me that we had to stay at his mom's house. Well his family have been incredibly nasty to me. I've been called a prostitute by his brother. Have been pushed by his sister because I told her she needs to call before coming over unannounced. Been embarrassed and consistently belittled by his mom..she's incredibly controlling over his family just like he is to me. I told him I didn't feel comfortable staying with them and of course my plane is cancelled I cannot go see my family now. Though my logic tells me I probably would not have been allowed to see them anyways even if we did fly out there. He told me to fuck off and proceeded to scream at me like I was a dog. I told him to stop treating me like a dog and he said I deserved it cause I dont listen to him otherwise. He said if I didn't make him angry he would t have to treat me the way he does. I'm apparently suppose to take responsibility for all my faults and when I asked him what his were his response was ""none, you always start everything"". I'm sitting here with my dog alone.

fg5br0,Update: Struggling to Get Over Abusive Ex,"I've posted on here a couple of times about how I've broken up with an ex recently who I live with who was verbally and emotionally abusive. Immediately afterward I felt amazing, but since then it's been a struggle and has been getting increasingly harder.

Since breaking up, he has told our friends he thinks we'll get back together and has asked for advice on how to win me back. He wrote me a letter apologizing for ""his part of the arguments"" and explaining he didn't mean to scare me etc, and I responded telling him that I need space. A couple of days later he sent me a message telling me that his friend is in trouble and he wants to help her, I'm the only person who will give good advice etc. I responded with some resources for her and said he should ask them how he can help her, but that I can't give him specific advice.

I'm pretty certain both of these things are tactics to win me back. He hasn't accepted the breakup yet because he doesn't think it's genuine. He's doing these things to break my resolve, not because he actually cares. I feel like he's probably told friends that don't know me that I'm crazy etc and has tried to make me look bad. I'd be very surprised if he came from a place of genuine concern for his friend and honestly, I feel like it might be totally fabricated from him.

It's really difficult to stay away because it goes against my instincts. I have always been a very loving and forgiving person and it's somewhat of a gift and a curse but I forget and move on very quickly when people mistreat me. The further I get from the abuse, the less bothered I am by the fact that it happened, and it's so much harder to stay away from him when I'm not angry. The parts that I hold onto are the loving parts and those make me miss him.

When I think about my ex before him (who wasn't abusive), I realize what I and my (recent, abusive) ex had was no comparison. It's such a clear difference to me between a genuinely loving and abusive relationship. I want what me and my (non-abusive) ex had again, but with someone else. And the fact I've gone so long with such a crappy substitute for it makes me feel very lonely.

I live with him and in many ways want to be close to him again, but that would include so much stuff that is detrimental to me, so I can't do it. I need to be with someone that's good to me which means being by myself for now until I'm ready. But I'm so scared and I feel so lonely. I wish I could change him and be happy with him and it hurts that that will never happen.",_silly_billy_,2020-03-09 17:49:45,6,499,10.55,47.6,51.62,10.56,20.79,13.83,96.39,64.33,25.25,17.43,10.82,0.4,0,6.01,0.2,7.82,4.61,12.42,11.42,7.21,9.42,2.2,22.04,4.81,2.4,2.61,0,2,8.42,3.61,4.81,0.8,2.2,0.8,16.03,0,0.8,0.6,5.41,14.83,3.81,2.4,2,1.6,1.6,3.81,2.2,0.4,0.2,1.6,0.4,0,0.4,0,0,7.01,3.01,0.8,2,1.6,0.8,4.41,15.63,1.4,10.82,2,4.61,5.21,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,1.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,14.83,4.61,2.81,0.2,0,0,0,0.2,0.4,5.41,1.2,0
fg5js3,Am I insane?,"Hi, this is my first time posting, and I feel insane. So here’s my shpeal. 

I’ve grown up in a very dysfunctional family. My dad was the one who glued our family together, and if any of us got in my mom’s face, swore at her, pushed her, we would be dead. If my brothers were to lay a hand on my sister or I, they would be dead. Sadly, my dad passed away in September from terminal cancer. Things have spiraled since he passed. 

My family is being torn apart by my older brother and his freak outs. He would always get irrational and delusional and angry. That was normal. He would get in aggressive fights with my twin brother over something small and would break tables and other things. That was normal. To me at least. When they would get bad, I would throw myself in the middle of them to stop them from sending eachother to the hospital and I would get banged and pushed around. Bruised up. That was normal, to me at least. My older brother would come home belligerently drunk raging pissed, and would break everything in sight and I would wake up to blood splattered around my house. That was normal. I thought that was normal. 

But within the past few weeks, things have turned physical. It was normal for him to push me hard to the floor or bed when I would instinctively get inbetween him and my mom when he was yelling in her face and breaking things the room. But this week, it’s become bad. Two sundays ago around 11 at night, my twin brother turned off the power to reboot it, and my older brother got triggered because he interrupted his game and came after him and started yelling in his face. Which this is how their fights always begin. Over something small and dumb. It then moved to upstairs. I swear they were going to kill eachother this time, and I instinctively threw myself inbetween them and I got banged around pretty bad and have a few bruises from it. Then last Tuesday, my mom told him no to taking her car for the night and he had his usual tantrum. Things escalated when she figured out he was lying about where he was going to go, and he got PISSED. He started getting in my mom’s face, and began breaking everything in the room, stopping himself multiple times from hitting her. I recorded him to send it to my twin brother so he could actually see what happens when he’s not around. (My mom always lies about what happens when my twin asks her about it.) So I decided to record it, to show him I’m not being dramatic and that I’m actually telling the truth. My older brother noticed I was recording him and started using force against me and was pinning me down to get my phone. My mom had to peel him off multiple times, and I swear if she wasn’t around he would’ve done worse things to me. He had the most evil look on his face and was breathing heavily staring me down. My arms are bruised from that night. Yesterday my older sister asked him to come down and do the dishes he used, and he flipped. He started pushing her against the wall and punched her so hard in the back, and her back was messed up and has scrapes and bruises. 

Is any of this normal? My mom likes to think it is, and always forgives and forgets and told me if I tell the police, that would hurt her more than anything.

So last night, I came home from work, a fight broke out, and I decided to leave and never come back. I’m broke, no longer have a car, and my best friend and her mom have taken me in. Bless them.

But, my family thinks I’m being over dramatic, and think I’m causing issues by speaking about this. Making me out to seem crazy for thinking this isn’t right or “normal” behavior.",embrew331,2020-03-09 18:04:57,2,689,21.33,55.77,70.54,1.29,14.66,13.21,93.32,58.93,23.22,17.42,9.29,0.44,0,6.53,1.16,5.81,2.9,12.92,9.43,4.5,9.72,1.02,20.46,5.52,2.18,1.74,0.58,1.45,4.93,0.87,4.06,0.15,2.32,0.58,14.95,3.48,0.15,3.34,6.1,10.6,1.89,1.31,2.76,2.18,1.16,3.05,2.03,0.73,0.58,0.73,2.61,1.74,0.58,0,0.29,8.42,3.05,0.44,2.32,2.03,0.87,7.69,8.27,0.58,19.3,3.77,8.27,7.4,0.29,1.31,1.45,0,0.15,0.44,0.58,0.58,0,0,0,0,14.22,6.53,4.79,0,0,0.29,0,0,0.29,2.03,0.29,0

fg8wgz,Need advice on a situation,"Twice now I have heard my apartment neighbours having heated arguments, and the first time I heard a bloody-murder-type scream from the girl, and the second time (tonight) I heard lots of raised voices and banging noises for 7 or 8 minutes, along with the girl saying ""ow"" and the guy saying ""f\*\*\* you"" followed by a loud bang.

Both times I have called the police, told them exactly what I heard, and both times they've taken it really seriously and gone and talked to this couple. However, each time the police leave empty handed and immediately after they leave everything seems to be peachy with the couple (laughing, joking, etc.).

Tonight the police followed up with me, and asked me VERY clearly if I was sure there was a girl in the apartment. I said that I had seen them literally two minutes before the cops had arrived (I was waiting outside the building and saw them taking their dog outside), and that I was sure it was a man and a woman. The cop told me he wanted to double check because when they went in to talk, there was only the man and a young boy who was apparently his little brother, no sign of the girl. The officer told me that their story was they like to play wrestle, and that they were unaware they were making so much noise. This guy had seen me in the hallway, going to get the mail, just after I had called the police, and my girlfriend who was still in the apartment said she overheard the guy sounding really angry and talking about me (""this f\*\*\*er saw me looking at him in the hallway""). So the cop reassured me that they told the guy there were multiple calls and that I was not the guy who called, but I still feel like he knows.

Essentially, I'm really concerned for this girl, and now for my own safety, as I think the fact that the girl was conveniently gone after just having been there 3 minutes before the cops showed up says a lot about the situation. Just wondering, is there anything I can do to make sure the cops catch this guy in the act, or at least have a better chance of bringing him in, or is it kinda up to the girl to come forward?

Thanks in advance for the help, I've been on edge all night and I'd really like a resolution to this problem.",wickedslick3K,2020-03-09 22:24:10,6,427,61.5,75.16,64.23,42.78,32.85,12.65,93.68,57.85,16.39,11.24,6.79,0,0.23,1.41,2.81,5.15,10.07,11.71,7.96,6.79,7.03,0.47,19.67,2.58,2.34,1.17,1.87,2.81,4.45,2.58,1.64,0,0.7,0.23,16.63,0.23,1.87,2.11,3.51,8.9,1.64,0.7,0.94,2.81,1.87,2.58,5.85,1.41,3.98,0.23,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,5.85,0.7,0.94,3.28,1.17,0.47,11.48,5.85,0.7,14.52,3.28,5.62,6.09,0.94,0.47,0.94,0,0,0.23,0.7,0.23,0.23,0,0.23,0,16.16,2.81,5.62,0,0,0.23,0,0.47,1.41,0.94,1.87,2.81

And almost exactly a month ago I was in the hospital for a fracture in my spine. Two weeks later I finally left. I definitely haven’t dealt with it yet and did recently find a new therapist...but I wasn’t thinking about him or anything. 

Could this subconsciously have affected my emotions/reactions to fights with this new guy this past month or am I just trying to find an excuse?",scp1066,2020-03-10 06:38:00,2,204,37.29,21.64,99,18.54,22.67,14.71,94.61,56.86,19.61,12.25,10.29,0,0.49,1.47,0,7.35,6.37,11.27,7.84,7.35,6.86,1.47,15.69,6.37,1.47,2.45,0.98,1.47,4.9,1.96,2.45,0,0.49,0.49,7.84,0,2.94,0,2.94,15.2,3.43,2.45,0.98,2.94,2.45,3.92,1.96,0.98,0,0.98,1.96,0.98,0.98,0,0,5.88,2.45,1.47,0.98,0.98,0,8.82,5.88,0,23.04,0,7.84,15.2,0.98,0.49,0,0,0,0,1.47,0.49,0.98,0,0,0,14.22,7.35,2.45,0,0,0.98,0,0,0,2.94,0,0.49
fgf8hc,I think I am an abuser. How can I fix my mess?,"Ok first I'm quite young, I grew up very sheltered I've never experienced anything like this so if I get stuff wrong please be nice about it 

So I know that what happened was domestic violence (I think) but I'm not sure if I am to blame for what happened because I also hit him..and he only pushed me. So I think I'm the one who did the violence ? 

My fiance and I are kind of Christian.. we do live together but we're not getting married until June. We were also waiting until marriage to have sex. (It's just what i wanted to do please no judgement) 

I thought him and I were on the same page this whole time but apparently not because yesterday he'd tried to initiate sex. This very much upset me because I thought he knew my desire to save that for our wedding day. I ended up walking out on him and he became a little angry I guess. He'd shoved me back into the room quite harshly and was beginning to yell about how I just up and left the room. I told him calmly that he should not have just pushed me. He continued yelling and pushed me again and I bumped my head on the wall that time. I became angry and banged my fist on his chest, hard enough he had to step backwards and hold his chest. 

I immediately regretted what I did because he looked like he was actually in some pain. I said sorry about a thousand times I was actually very sorry and I did feel bad. I knew what I did was wrong of me. 

He ended up walking out after and that only made me feel worse. While he was gone I had a bit of a nap and he ended up coming back while I was napping. He climbed in next to me while I was napping I was awake enough to know he was there but still to tired to open my eyes. He layed there with me for a bit but I only completely woke up when I realised he was putting his penis inside me. I was freaked out but I was still feeling so much shame and guilt from hitting him in the chest I just laid there and let him have sex with me to make myself feel better about hitting him. It only lasted a minute or two but now I feel even worse because that's not how I wanted it to happen and I feel like I've let myself down. 

We're still set to get married in June but now I don't know if I still want to. I feel so miserable ? I don't want to do anything. I feel silly because it shouldn't make a difference to if I did it now or if I waited a couple more months. Idk I just wanted it to be a good memory and not at all like it happened. It wasent really like what I had imagined it kind of just felt like he was going on and out and there was no connection or anything because we weren't speaking ??? Does that make sense ?

Anyway I'm just writing this because I'm confused if I go ahead with marrying him or not. I try so hard to be a good person but idk how to fix what I have done.

fghvgy,Our friend (22M) is being abused and harassed by his emotionally unstable wife (2?F). We want to help him. Should we intervene?,"Hi! We have this friend who's always being abused by his wife. My friend, who's very kind, allows such things done to him because we think his wife is emotionally troubled. Not only that, every time they fight, the blame goes to us, his friends. She blames us for almost everything. She screams and texts horrible things.

We keep telling our friend that he needs to do something about his wife's attitude. She's toxic and bad for him. He agrees that she's toxic but he's scared that his wife might kill herself if he leaves her.

Is there anything we can do more to help? Should we intervene? My friend doesn't have the balls to fix this himself. It's been going on for many years now and it's affecting him emotionally and physically. We see him with bruises and scratches whenever we meet.

My friend is not a cheater. He's not capable of that and we know it. We think his wife is schizophrenic because of her unbelievable imaginations.

Although we admit he sometimes lies about where he is so we can hang out.

Should we talk to his wife even though she hates us or let this problem be handled by this couple? I know it's their problem but our friend is not doing anything about. He just lets his wife abuse and assault him.

Our friend is being abused physically and emotionally by his wife and he's not doing anything about it no matter how many times we told him to. We as his friends want to intervene.

fgmnev,Advice,"I need advice...

I'm currently 25 years old and have not lived at home since I was 18. I moved back in with my mother right before Christmas because I received a contingent job offer with a company that I will likely have to relocate for; I didn't want to sign a lease so I reached out to see if I could move home for a few months while the background check processes and everything is verified. 

This was a HUGE mistake. My mother has always been abusive, both mentally and physically, toward me. The older I get the more I begin to realize that she is a narcissistic parent with slight sociopathic tendencies. 

Long story short... we got into an argument and she straight up physically assaulted me. Make no mistake, I never touched her or anything. It's like she blacked out in anger and attacked me. She squeezed both sides of my head and dug her nails into the back of my ears. I was in shock for a moment but was finally able to push her off. I was able to take pictures of myself and my ears and neck were very bloody. I left the house to go for a walk and when I returned she had taken my house key and locked me out with a note that said ""enjoy living in the garage."" It's been a couple weeks now and she has not let me in to get my things. I've been forced to shower at my gym and yes, I am living in the garage with no running water. There is a sofa. 

What can I do to get my things?

I came to help him in the kitchen and he resulted in pinning my up to the wall by my throat. My oldest 17 year old came and interjected and he got hurt as well. He was pushed up to the wall as well. He went to his room and we didnt know it but he called cops. Hisband had already left to diffuse the situation. I only told cops about me. They said I didnt have to press charges and we all agreed he has PTSD from war. He wasnt arrested, I didnt press charges. We didnt talk for 3 days. 

Then my husband enrolled in aa and had his first alcoholic screening today. We also went to couples counseling session this afternoon and lunch. Seemed to be on a good start. 

The minute we get home, sheriff calls me. I didnt get the Voicemail till later, asking to call them back.

fgywza,Becoming numb to the abuse,"Me[24F] and my boyfriend[35M] have been together for 7 long years. His temper has escalated over the years and he began physically abusing me about 4 years ago. 

I fell into a really bad suicidal depression about 2 years ago because I lost the support of my friends and family due to me choosing to stay with him and on top of that I was pregnant and miscarried at 16 weeks. 

I hated him at the time but once he saw how depressed I was, he eased up and became that hero in my life again. He was loving and caring. He showed me that he was all I needed in this world and I fell for his evil ways again. This honeymoon phase only last about 6 months and he was right back to beating my face in. 

Recently I’ve found myself become more and more numb to getting hit. It still physically hurts but not like it used to. I emotionally feel NOTHING when he hits me now. In the past, I would always feel an aching pain in my heart and have hurt feelings but now I feel no way about it and I just want to sleep it away. I literally just go lay down and fall asleep. 

I don’t speak to him at all anymore unless he speaks to me. I don’t ask him for anything anymore and I just don’t trust him overall. Everything he does and has done for me emotionally, financially, etc. is calculated. Somehow it’ll be thrown in my face and used as leverage to hurt me emotionally or physically. 

I’m honestly scared that I will fall back into that state of depression I was in and I don’t want that. I can tell that he’s noticed my change and he’s trying to be that nice guy again. I feel myself falling for the lies again but I know they’re lies. I don’t get it. I 100% KNOW for a fact know that’s he’s lying to me, I know he’s gonna hurt me again  and I know he doesn’t care about me BUT I feel myself wanting to love him again. Idk if I hope that he’ll love me or what but it makes no sense and I can’t understand it. 

He says that he wants me to have his child soon and to marry me but I am sure that this is calculated too. This is the thing that hurts my feelings the most, is that he only wants me to have his child and marry him because he wants to have leverage on me. Also that after being with him for all of these years how can he not love me or at least respect me a little more. Like how after 7 years can someone not at least care for someone who’s been loving and genuine with them to some capacity.

My family were extremely abusive to me growing up and He can be a bit controlling too  e.g. calling me a slut when i talked to male strangers who approached us in the street on holiday and telling me im not allowed to go out clubbing with my friends. However, the real trouble started a couple days ago. we got into an argument which resulted in me storming down to my room. he chased after me and began banging on the door and then broke the door panel. when i let him in, he shoved me onto the bed, jumped ontop of me and began screaming in my face that i was a fucking bitch. he then pushed me so hard against a wall that i hit my head and have a swollen bump from this. After this, unprovoked he picked up a plate a smashed it on the floor. he shoved me again so i slapped him and he was so angry that he spat in my face twice. he then blamed this all on me and came back to my room while i was crying to empty a water bottle over me. he told me that i deserved all this and that im a ""dumb retarded bitch...go kill yourself"". One of my housemates called the police but it worsened today. today he broke the rest of my bedroom door after i told him im breaking up with him and he threw some of my clothes out of his bedroom window into the rain. i feel trapped. im a student and cant move out at the moment but he keeps telling me im playing the victim and that this isnt abuse ""im just a child and a pussy"". im confused and i need some kind of affirmation. help me please.",Queenshitlord69,2020-03-11 15:27:38,25,325,37.97,30.03,91.48,1,17.11,13.85,92.31,60.31,25.23,20.31,13.54,0.92,0.31,5.54,0,4.92,7.69,12.62,6.15,4,9.23,0.92,15.38,2.77,0.92,1.23,1.54,1.85,7.38,0.62,6.77,0.31,3.38,1.23,12.31,0.31,0.62,0,6.15,6.15,0.31,1.23,0.31,1.23,0.92,2.15,0.92,0,0.31,0.62,3.38,1.85,0.62,0.92,0.31,7.38,2.77,0.31,4,0.62,0.31,7.38,7.38,0.92,19.08,3.38,9.85,6.15,0.62,0.92,3.38,0,0,0.31,2.46,2.15,0.31,0,0,0,10.77,6.77,1.23,0,0,0.31,0,0,1.23,0.31,0.62,0.31
fh6tmu,What should I do to help my mom,"Hello,

Im making this post because I don’t know what to do or who to talk to. My mother is in an emotionally abusive relationship with my father. He has never hit her but has threatened to multiple times. He calls her nasty names in front of me and my brother all the time, and even worse names when we’re not around. He blames her for almost all of his problems, and after he has an episode, he’ll act like nothing ever happened for weeks until it ultimately happens again. 

Both me and my younger brother have told her to get a divorce, and she says she wants to, but my father is the bread winner of our house and we need his money for us to live comfortably and for me and my brother to go to college. My mom doesn’t want me to confront him because she’s scared of how he will react if he finds out what she’s been telling me. She says she’s tried talking to him about it many times but he never listens because he knows she can’t leave. 

Im going to be leaving for college in a few months. I don’t want my mother to be unhappy but I just don’t know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

fh812g,A year “away” from me ex,"Last year my ex of 17 years assaulted me.

I went to multiple people, quietly,  for help to get me and my kids out of the situation. This wasn’t the first time and I knew it would not be the last. I couldn’t live with a person who enjoyed hurting me so much and refused to acknowledge the amount of pain he caused me on a regular basis. The friends and family I went to didn’t care. No one helped - I was told he makes too much money so just put up with it. I hit my lowest. Realizing I didn’t matter to the people I cared the most about made me not only feel worthless but extremely depressed. I was already struggling with the things he did to me, but to hear from others that they thought it was fine made me feel like I really was nothing. 

The parts of my life I value the most have been a living hell. When he found out that I was trying to leave he promised to make things even worse for me. He used every form of violence  towards me (sexual, financial, emotional, mental, physical, legal). He actively sabotaged my relationship with my kids. To top it all off he is getting away with everything he did. He has better connections and I was told he was “more valuable than” me. 

It makes me sick to my stomach the level people will sink if the right kind of money is involved. My life has become a nightmare while  he is living his dream.

I was specifically told by both his family and his employer (which was also my employer when some of the assaults happened, “don’t do anything to ruin his reputation”). I even got threatened if I went to the police or spoke about it. Apparently if you are a doctor with some connections and money it doesn’t matter who you hurt or how. Every lawyer I went to for advice told me to not press charges for him assaulting me because essentially that doesn’t look good for me. (But apparently me barely being able to function from the nightmares and ptsd he has given me is “better” for everyone....)

With the anniversary of several things that happened, I can barely sleep more than a few hours. There are days I pray to just go to sleep and not wake up. 

I have been past my breaking point for too long and there no relief in sight. Even getting away from him doesn’t fix anything; he purposefully and successfully damaged everything I cared about. 

I will never understand why some people get so much joy from hurting people.",thelizziepants,2020-03-11 18:07:22,0,454,31.36,24.72,49.5,9.51,16.21,14.54,96.92,61.01,21.15,15.86,10.79,0,0.44,4.41,0.22,5.29,5.07,13.66,8.81,6.83,6.17,3.52,18.5,4.19,2.64,1.54,0.66,3.96,7.93,3.3,4.63,0.44,1.1,1.54,11.45,0.44,0.22,0,4.41,14.54,1.98,2.64,1.1,3.96,2.42,4.19,2.64,0.44,0.66,1.54,3.08,0.88,1.98,0.22,0,7.71,1.1,1.76,3.74,1.98,0.44,8.59,7.49,0.66,9.47,1.54,4.41,3.52,1.76,0.66,0.44,0.88,0.44,0,0.66,0.22,0,0,0,0,14.1,6.61,2.2,0,0.22,0,0,0.22,1.76,1.76,1.32,0
fh851e,I'm going crazy not remembering anything. Possible brain damage.,"Hi,

I was seeing this guy for six months. He has unmedicated bipolar disorder and drinks. He would be verbally abusive and call me names, but would apologize a few days later saying it was mania.


Two weeks ago I was a victim of what I believe to be assault. I took a few tylenol pm and went to the guy I was dating's house. I do not remember anything from 10pm to 4:30 I am. We were fighting previously and then went inside to have sex. I remember going inside and coming to in the driveway. He was yelling that I was lying about losing my keys. Apparently I spoke to his parents and I was acting 'crazy' but no one called the cops and they were just adamant I drove home.

I drove home confused, pulled over to vomit a few times, vomited all day, I could not even keep down water. It also took me a hour to find my house when I parked a street away and was naked in a jacket. And found bruises all over me. The most serious one being in the inside of my arm. I asked him about it, first what he said is that I was walking into walls, then that I kept falling over and hit my head on my car. I also found what appeared to be a thumbprint mark on my neck and bruising all over my hands. I also found bruises on my breasts. Legs and upper lip.

I went to the er and filed a report the next day. Case is still ongoing. No toxicology was done, and I still cannot remember the incident at all. I have been having trouble spelling and concentrating. I am not sure if I should go back to the doctors and what kinds of tests I should ask for. If anyone has any ideas I would be really grateful.

The DA still hasn't reviewed my case, no arrest, was made, and my EPO has expired and I have a hearing for a TRO because it was denied. I feel like I'm going crazy and I have no idea what happened, and I'm worried nothing will be charged. He is also now aware my restraining order was denied. I'm not sure what to do.",oneofthosebabes,2020-03-11 18:14:54,0,394,22.07,12.15,92.03,1,13.13,13.2,92.64,58.88,18.78,14.47,12.18,0.25,0,1.78,0.25,4.31,5.33,9.9,12.94,4.06,8.12,3.05,23.6,3.3,0.76,1.78,1.78,2.28,5.08,0.76,4.31,0.51,1.27,0.25,6.6,0.25,0.51,0,2.28,12.94,3.55,0.51,2.03,2.79,1.78,3.3,2.28,0.51,1.27,0.51,4.57,2.28,1.52,0.76,0.51,5.58,0.76,0.51,3.55,0.51,0.51,11.17,8.12,1.78,14.21,3.55,5.33,5.33,1.02,0.25,1.27,0,0,0,0.51,0,0.25,0,0.25,0,12.94,7.61,3.05,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,2.03,0,0

fh9ulx,I finally told him I want a divorce,"Where to start. We have been together for 8 years. He has managed to sever relationships with my friends and most of my family.  He has been verbally abusive and subject to outrage at any given moment. Doesnt take much for him to lose his cool.  Typically its verbal outbursts with swearing and yelling sometimes breaking things,  slamming doors etc..  then when the smoke has cleared he will give me the silent treatment until I reluctantly admit fault. This all REALLY bothers me due to being a survivor of childhood abuse and neglect. Twice it has been physical. The first time he had my head pinned to the floor then almost a year ago I wound up with a broken nose and blacked out in a pool of blood on my tile floor. He pushed me. We were arguing.  He said I fell. No way I fell because I landed face first and didn't even break the fall with my hands it happened so fast. He moved out for awhile.  Made promises to work on his anger issues and find steady employment.  Neither of these things have improved. I work my tail off commuting an hour each way then working 60 to 70 hour weeks just trying to make ends meet. My car needs so much work it's dangerous to drive.  He has laid on the couch for all of last week and two days this week when we have bills up the wazoo due to his lack of steady income.  He works for his friend so basically when he feels like it. I have consistently bought all of the food that comes in the house. Last time he contributed to groceries was November.  I have had to cover at least 2/3 if not all or  his part of the monthly bills. I've run myself into the ground. I  Literally. Have been sick since Halloween. Anemic, low red blood cell count. Have been to a hematologist and still trying to recover.

fhdihg,"I f(18) might be in a toxic relationship with my partner, M(18) and I need advice","This is my first relationship. He has been my first everything. 
It started with him being unkind, calling me a bitch a lot, sometimes insulting me, comparing me sexually to his ex-girlfriend. It upset me but I also thought I was being dramatic, the majority of the time he was sweet and vulnerable with me and he always brushed all of this off as being a joke. 
He told me he wouldn’t feel anything if I died, he wasn’t kidding. When I told him this upset me, he said he didn’t care. 
Then it progressed. When we were around other people he started being really nasty. With his friend he would call me names, tell me I was dumb, push me a bit too hard when we were play fighting. And he would always look for validation from his friend. Around a relative of his he embarrassed me, ignored me, made me feel left out. Even the relative commented on the way he treated me despite them being very close. 
Lately things have gotten strange. Sometimes we play fight, very gently. More affectionately than anything. But he’s been taking it too far. He started slapping me in the face. Hard. And always saying it was a joke, it wasn’t even hard, stop being dramatic. 
He pushed me into the wall hard enough that my legs were covered in bruises, I told him it wasn’t funny anymore and he had hurt me. He said I was being dramatic. 
During sex he usually pulls out, one time he didn’t and I knew he wasn’t going to - it was completely consensual. But, the two times since then he hasn’t pulled out, he hasn’t even warned me he was going to come. That’s not something we’ve agreed on beforehand. When I told him that wasn’t okay he said it was my fault, I should’ve moved off before he did. 
I’m lying to my friends and family, I don’t want this to be a big deal. I’m confused and I don’t know if I am being dramatic or not. I can’t tell him that what he does is wrong because he genuinely thinks it’s okay - he says it’s not that serious. He’ll call me crazy.

I didn't think too hard about it when she got some pink lemonade in her water at the soda fountain. She said she wanted water, but I thought it was normal for some people to tap a little of the lemonade to get a little flavor. I had water anyways, so maybe it's an accident, we can switch. 

Maybe its okay she got mad when she found out it wasn't pure water. And maybe I could have better phrased it than ""I think you made a mistake"".  Maybe its okay to be so angry that you refuse my water and tell me ""I don't want to drink anything you've put your mouth on."" It hurt me, because we had shared a kiss only a few minutes before. Maybe its okay to get angry that I didn't immediately get you water, but honestly I was trying to understand what I needed to do. 

It's not okay to throw water at me in my face then storm off. 

Maybe its okay to get angry that I didn't come after you. 

It's not okay to come back and throw the burger at me. And I certainly don't think ""FINE IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT? I PAID FOR THE BURGER ANYWAYS, SO YOU RUINED AND WASTED MY MONEY"" is really what you wanted to say. 

It's not okay that you grabbed my wrist so hard that it left marks for hours, and dragged me out. 

Maybe its okay that you didn't want to give me space. my pants were wet, and my shirt was stained with sauce. I wasn't okay, and I was trying really hard not to be angry. Actually, I was angry and sad. 

But It's not okay to tell me I'm a coward, and if I had any legitimate reason or explanation I wouldn't clam up like a dumb robot. Like a politician caught in a lie. FINE I'LL GIVE YOU TIME TO THINK UP A LIE. I'm just going to disprove it, and show you that you're a liar. 

Maybe I should have tried harder to try to get through. But every time you cut me off, It took a lot of effort to try to have a conversation. ""Okay, I'm calm! I'm going to listen to your excuses. But maybe you shouldn't focus on how you're the victim in this. you always do"" It took an hour to tell you two things without interruption. ""I want to have a conversation"" ""WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'RE HAVING. STOP WASTING MY TIME."" ""I want to have a dialogue, and I want to listen to what you have to tell me. And I hope that you want to hear what I want to say"" 

Maybe I should have offered the shower first. I wanted to get freshened up for a work call. It isn't okay that you tried to stop me from going to work, gripping my wrist so hard you left a second set of marks, and refusing to let go. It's not okay that you threaten suicide if I go to work. It's not okay that you threaten to contact my workplace with rape allegations. It's not okay to threaten me to break my arm with your martial arts training if I try to get my hands free. It's not okay to tell me you've been secretly recording all hour conversations, and that you've named me as the cause in your suicide note. It not okay that you got angry when I changed my tone of voice, and in clearer enunciation stated my name, time, and date, and stated I did not want you to die or kill yourself. It's not okay to run out of the room, and get even more mad that I didn't chase after you.  I promised you we'd talk after my work calls. 

Maybe its okay that you got angry that I was recording audio, and told you I was recording audio when I got back. Its not okay to tear my phone out of my hands, and threaten to destroy it. Its not okay that you then threw the phone at the bed, then the floor. 

It's not okay that you took my glasses off my face, grabbed me by my collar and shoved me to the wall. She kept shoving, pushing and hitting me until I was cornered. I told you two things ""please don't touch me"" and ""I would like to leave this room. let me leave the room"" It's not okay that you kept shoving me and yelling no. It's not okay that you sat in front of the door of the room and told me that I should kick you if I wanted to leave. It's not okay that when you let me out of the room, you didn't let me get my things. It's not okay you followed me out into the hallway, and cornered me again in front of the elevator. It's not okay you grabbed at my jacket when I ran for the staircase, and I slipped out of the jacket to sprint down the stairs. 

It isn't okay. 

Thank you for agreeing to come out and talk in an open space with other people. Thank you for agreeing to have me record audio. Thank you for letting me have a dialogue. I hope that you understood me when I told you ""I'm here to have a dialogue. whatever you want to tell me, have me know or understand. Any question you have, or anything you want to know. You decide, okay?"" Every time you cut me off, and every time you ""poked holes"" in my story. ""okay so do you want to talk about that now? I'm here to have a dialogue. whatever you want to tell me, have me know or understand. Any question you have, or anything you want to know. You decide, okay?""

We talked, for 7 hours until the sun was rising. I don't know if you were really listening. I don't know if you noticed. You cut me off every time I was speaking, except for 5 times. I hated myself for counting. 

It's not okay that you got angry for the dialogue to not get to a conclusion. I told you, you decide. every time you cut me off, I asked you if thats what you wanted to have to talk about. 

I love you. I think you're a special person. Hard working, intelligent. You overcame adversity and are immensely strong, and tremendously vulnerable. You do inspiring work, and for beautifully altruistic goals. Your sense of mission and obligation to give back is endearing and honorable.  I know you have a passion, and your anger against injustice makes you fight for people. 

I also know your anger makes you fight me. We've had fights. I haven't been the best boyfriend. I was happy that you told me I was your rock, and that you felt relaxed and happy with me. I want you to be happy. We've gotten over a lot of these hills. some of them almost broke us. You've worked so hard to make this work, way more than I had.  

Now you've asked me to just tell you that I'm going to dump you. You've accused me that I've already made up my mind, and I'm just dragging it out to inflict more pain on you. I'm sorry. I really wanted to see you once again. I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to know what you are thinking. I didn't want to make a decision by talking to your anger, not the person I loved. 

I miss you already. 

and I'm sad. I'm sure if I apologize, you will let me back in. We might have some good times again. It's not okay. Today is the day I acknowledge that 13 hours of abuse is still abuse. Abuse is not okay. 

It is over. It needs to be over. 

Thanks everyone. As a guy, it's not the same. I was never in physical danger. It was only for a night. Because of the community, I had a friendly voice when I ran to a different hotel and asked for help. Because of the community, I recognized that I needed to protect myself. Because of the community, it was only a night.

fhquik,I (f26) being abused by my partner (m28) I have no one to talk to and I feel so isolated,"For context me and my partner have been living together for the last 4 months, we've had arguments prior to moving in but they haven't been physical until christmas. 

Our arguments have been getting out of hand lately and have become very aggressive where on several occasions he has gone for me and it usually starts with strangling me or hitting me round the head several times. I have always asked him to stop and to get off of me but it never works so I always have to push him off of me or if I'm lucky try and bend his fingers back if he's got them around my neck.

In the past week we've had to major arguments both leading to hitting, and this is something ever so small and dumb like shopping bags or if I've mentioned something that he has told me I shouldn't bother with - like upgrading my phone as my contract ends next month. 

However lately he has taken his verbal abuse to a new level saying things like if he killed me, no one would care if I was dead because no one likes me (I'm estranged from my mum and brother, my dad died a few years ago, we work together and some of his friends are sort of mine as well) and I hate the fact that he says that because it is something I'm very insecure about because my relationship with my mum has been hell. 

To make things worse, I cannot talk to people at work who I consider trustworthy because he said they'll believe him over me because they have known him longer and I'm just an outcast still, but he can talk to his friends about what has been happening. Hes also said I can only talk to him about what's been happening and my friends can just know that we argue but not to the extent of it, which I feel like is unfair.

Sorry for rambling, I just have no one to talk to and this is driving me insane because I honestly feel like everything is my fault.",livieleanor,2020-03-12 17:33:10,3,374,8.27,44.69,71.08,1.26,41.56,14.44,95.99,64.71,23.8,18.45,11.23,1.34,0,4.81,1.07,5.35,2.14,13.64,12.83,6.42,10.7,2.41,20.32,4.28,2.41,1.34,1.34,1.34,6.42,1.6,4.81,0.27,3.21,0.53,15.78,1.07,1.34,0.53,5.35,12.83,2.14,2.14,1.87,4.28,1.6,4.28,2.94,0.27,1.34,1.6,1.6,1.07,0.53,0,0,8.56,3.74,1.34,1.34,1.34,1.07,6.15,14.97,0.27,13.37,1.34,4.81,7.49,1.07,0.27,0,0.27,0.53,0.8,0.8,0.53,0,0,0.27,0,9.63,2.14,2.41,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,3.21,1.6,0
fhr2bg,Survivor with PTSD - how to find work?,"Hi there,

I'm a survivor of domestic abuse with PTSD.  I've isolated my self for years after finally getting to a safe environment.  I'm starting to feel strong enough to expand my safe zone and work again.  Has anyone else been in this position?  Isolating to the point of being unable to work?  If so, how did you go about getting back into the workforce?  Are there programs that help survivors find work?  If there is another post on this that I've missed, I would love a link to it.

I'm in California if that helps at all.

fhvzwl,Four Months,"He’s been so good to me the last four months. I think I fell more deeply in love with him because it seemed as if he was a completely new person. His anger, temper and modes of coping mechanisms have changed dramatically - he went to therapy and is continually taking anger management classes on top of mood medications. 

I’ve just finished nursing school. I landed a job at one of the biggest hospitals in California and the only thing that was weighing in on my heart is trying to figure out how to ease him back into my family because they have been aware of the abuse before. 

I can admit that I am challenging to communicate with. When I am upset I tend to avoid the conversation and even stay silent the duration of the argument because I know that whatever I am planning to say would not make the situation any better. He’s been so understanding of that the last four months, he met all of my weaknesses with patience and tenderness. 

Tonight was his breaking point. I don’t even want to bother with the back story of how things escalated but tonight he put me in a chokehold and dragged me across the room. In these moments I find it hard to believe that it is reality because I live in such a dream when we aren’t arguing. What scared me the most tonight is that while he picked me up and tried to drag me into his room I screamed for his roommates to intervene. Immediately I see that he regrets what had just happened and bursts into tears. As his roommate is trying to pull him off of me my boyfriend clings in to my arm to prevent me from escaping. He yells at his roommate to leave the both of us alone and to my surprise he does eventually leave us by ourselves. 

We calm down and talk for an hour. Most of it consisting of how the both of us feel betrayed considering our agreement on working together for our best interest. He tells me that I paint him out to be a monster when he knows that he is a good person at heart. I believe he is a good person inside. I also believe that I push his buttons which causes him to snap and become physical with me. I do not believe that any difficulty that I bring him justifies him hurting me. 

I love him so much. I never in my whole entire life could have seen that I would fall into something like this. I am ridden with shame and guilt and disappointment. Most of all I hate that someone could not only be so emotionally and physically aggressive with me and I still try to find reasons to stay.",conethread,2020-03-13 00:40:14,3,474,38.89,58.35,63.02,5.51,18.23,16.67,94.73,61.81,23.63,17.72,9.7,1.69,0,6.12,0.21,5.91,4.64,15.82,7.59,5.49,7.38,1.27,16.88,4.01,2.53,2.11,0.84,2.74,7.59,2.74,4.64,1.05,2.11,1.05,12.66,0.21,0.84,0,6.33,12.03,4.01,2.74,1.48,2.53,1.05,1.27,1.9,0.42,0.84,0.63,2.95,0.63,1.69,0,0.21,9.07,4.01,2.11,1.69,1.27,0.84,3.59,10.97,1.05,15.61,2.95,8.65,4.85,1.27,0.63,1.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.96,5.27,0.42,0,0,0,0,0.21,0,1.05,0,0

fhxtdt,"Angry with police for not taking it seriously, and with lawyer for dismissing my DV experience. Not sure how to handle everything.","Hi there.  


TL;DR: Looking for some emotional support, as I feel dismissed and not heard or believed. Not sure how to cope.

  
From 2009-2018, I (F31) was in an abusive relationship with a man (M34). We had a child after 5 years together, then after 7 years I realised that he was abusive. I left in secret, and after advise from another woman with past DV experience, I called the police to say I was worried my partner would do something bad or dangerous. I was already in touch with a few support charities and so on, and I was scared for my safety. He had never hit me or similar, but his violent outbursts and suicide threats were very frightening. He was also emotionally abusive, gaslighting me, and sexually abusing me. I have C-PTSD now, in part due to the long term abuse from him.   


The police person I spoke to on the phone laughed at me. Said ""well what do you want me to do about it? This is nothing to do with us, we can't do anything."". They made me feel utterly stupid and as if I was overreacting completely. I ended up leaving, but took him back the next day, as I still loved him and he promised he'd change and so on. I'm sure you know the script. I got rid of him for good in 2018, 18 months after I first left.  


Fast forward to now. I want to move to my home country with our son. Ex is of course refusing - he wants to keep control of everything he possibly can. I contacted a lawyer for mediation, due to poverty I have to stick to ones that offer legal aid, which is pretty much 1 maybe 2 in my city. The one I found was a woman in her 60s, she had a lot of experience and on paper seemed decent. However during the pre-mediation appointment, she prodded me about why the relationship fell apart, and I said quite honestly that he was xyz abusive, had violent outbursts, and I am currently in therapy to deal with the aftermath of it. 10 minutes later she wrote in her notes whilst saying out loud ""no domestic abuse"". Completely dismissed it.  


My psychologist was very cross, as what my ex did was prosecutable, and this lawyer completely dismissed it. I think my ex must have charmed her, as he comes across super nice, friendly, polite, charming etc etc on the surface. He's a master manipulator, and he saw her before I did. She completely took his side during our mediation, and I feel so defeated. I'm now trying to gather evidence from my contact with DV support services, so that I can get legal aid and maybe go to court to try to get to leave the country. It's a long shot, but I have to do it. Please don't defend my ex that he wants to see our child, and that I'm unreasonable and so on, I can't cope with more of that. It's not a rash decision, I've wanted to go back with my child for over 5 years, and it's 100% the best option for my child and myself.",LittlePurrx,2020-03-13 03:56:21,0,563,41.45,52.13,49.73,31.84,16.09,15.45,90.05,57.9,19.89,15.28,9.06,1.07,0.36,4.62,0.18,4.62,4.09,15.28,8.17,5.51,7.82,1.95,16.7,4.97,2.49,1.07,2.31,1.24,7.99,4.09,3.73,0.71,2.13,0,12.97,0.18,0.53,1.78,3.55,11.55,1.95,1.24,1.42,3.02,2.31,2.84,3.37,0.53,1.6,0.71,0.89,0.18,0.53,0.18,0,8.88,2.49,1.07,3.73,1.42,0.89,7.1,9.59,0.53,13.14,1.78,6.04,6.22,2.49,0,0.36,0.36,0,0.18,0.89,0,0,0,0.18,0,17.58,6.22,6.39,0.18,0.18,0.18,0,0.71,0.71,2.13,0.71,0.18
fhyt87,How fast can DV escalate? Is it normal to still have feelings for your attacker?,I’ve never been in a situation quite like this before but for the last few months I’ve been planning on leaving my boyfriend. I own the home we are in so I was planning to get him to a friends house and then let him know he wasn’t to be coming back. He’s slapped me twice but under the circumstances (I accidentally hit him in the testicles) I had thought I deserved it. He never regularly physically abused me but the mental abuse was daily. I never thought he would get physically abuse when I left him but I knew he would try to break things and I didn’t want my kids around. He became increasingly angry and breaking things every time we would get in an argument I became to be so afraid of what leaving him would really be like. I tried to execute my plan yesterday and he went through my phone and seen one single message I had forgot to delete and went crazy. He smashed everything electronic I own. He started with my wifi boxes and routers and then tried to flip my tv. He then went to my bedroom where I keep my computer than my parents got me. It has a huge 32 inch monitor and I stored all the photos and videos of my best friend who recently passed on there. He picked up the monitor and smashed it into the wall. He then tried to hit me with my mirror and broke it on me. He kept screaming I was a lying bitch and he wasn’t stupid. He kept saying how “ I should kill you for all the time I’ve spent loving you” and then lunges at my neck and said “I’m going to kill you”. I’ve never been so scared in my entire life. All I could think about was what would happen with my children. I knew he was going to kill me or at least try. I fought him off and called the police and he bolted into the woods. I haven’t heard or seen him since and I’m extremely scared. Is it normal for someone to escalate from mental abuse to trying what he did so quickly? I’m so confused with how I feel. After everything he’s done why am I worried that he may be laying out in the rain? It has never been this bad one other time he smashed his phone to pieces and screamed at me and went crazy and said I had cheated while I went to Walmart.

fhyzj0,"Not sure how I (20F) should leave alcoholic BF (30M) who has a violent history. Been together 18 months, living together 14. Worried about welfare of pets.","TLDR;   Not sure about best way to leave alcoholic BF, worried about our shared pets welfare, advice? 

I’ve decided I’m leaving my emotionally manipulative bf. He’s ten years my senior and we’ve been together 18 months or so. He is all I could ask for when sober (or if he’s just had a few) but when he’s drunk his personality changes. 

When we got together he was living with his dad with no job, no license and no way to function as an adult, having just been released after a four year jail stint. I got him a job soon after and have driven him to work every day since. I got him his permit, but he failed his test, so I’m still driving. He has another booked, but has not made any effort to book lessons or drive with his dad. 

I have been unemployed myself for much of the time, living on benefits while studying. I’ve worked a few temp jobs but otherwise he’s provided for me (except for when we first got together). He is a good provider. 

The underlying issue is his drinking. His family are multigenerational alcoholics. His father frequently drives drunk, and he’s been in trouble years before for driving without a license and drunk driving / drug driving. We have three cats, two of which are his (we have adopted them since we got together). He has thrown things and accused me of cheating when drunk, he’s threatened to kill me and my family, he’s gotten me fired because of his behaviour at work functions. He’s damaged relationships between my family, friends and myself, and I’m constantly apologising on his behalf. 

I have gotten a house with a friend, and can move in shortly. But I’m not sure how to go about leaving. 

I am worried he’ll immediately turn back to drugs, smash the house up and hurt the two cats I can’t legally take with me (this is my biggest fear, other than him hurting me). He is extremely dangerous and can and will hurt people if he’s angry enough. 

I don’t know if I should take my cat and go, or if I should just take them all regardless and leave. I’m still responsible for taking him to and from work, so leaving during the day is tricky. I also don’t know wether trying to talk it out with him will end in me getting hurt. I don’t want to leave my pets to be abandoned by him if he returns to jail or drug use (meth), but on the off chance he keeps himself together and finds a way to work, he deserves to have his cats as company. 

My real estate agent is letting me break lease early under the DV act and is very supportive so I don’t have to worry about that, thankfully. 

I know it’s long, but what would you guys do in this situation? Any advice would be so helpful. 

Thank you all.",breathing_dead,2020-03-13 05:37:39,12,524,16.24,58.3,39.9,5.45,16.38,15.27,92.75,57.44,19.27,17.18,7.63,1.34,0.38,7.44,0.38,2.1,3.44,12.02,12.4,5.92,10.11,2.48,20.23,4.01,1.53,1.91,1.72,1.91,6.11,2.1,4.01,1.15,1.15,1.15,15.65,1.15,1.15,0,8.97,12.21,1.34,1.91,2.48,2.67,1.53,5.15,0.76,0,0,0.76,2.67,0,1.72,0,1.53,11.64,4.77,2.29,1.91,2.86,0.76,4.01,14.31,0.76,15.27,4.01,4.96,6.3,4.77,2.48,1.72,0.19,0,0.19,0.76,0,0.76,0,0,0,18.32,5.73,4.58,0,0.19,0.38,0,0,0,4.58,2.67,0.19

fi4wbh,Is it normal to feel stupid for not seeing the red flags earlier,"‪I should’ve known I was in danger the first time he told me he hit his ex and she left him but he couldn’t remember if it was an accident or not and then I proceeded to feel bad for him bc he was crying about it I wanna go back in time and call myself out for being so dumb. When he wasn’t in rage-mode he would tell me how he’s always been the one who gets broken up with in relationships because of his shit behavior, and also that he only acts like this towards romantic partners, not friends or family. Then when he’s angry he blows up and tells me I’m the only person who has ever brought out this side of him. Then the cycle repeats. I constantly found myself questioning what was real and what wasn’t with what he told me. Then when I dumped him he blamed me for it because I was the one who stayed and so therefore I somehow asked for it. He pulled that one a few times- I would call him out on the way he would insult me, all the name calling, telling me how much he hates me, etc. and then he would say I knew who he was and what I signed up for when i started dating him. I feel like I’ve been manipulated for months and months and finally now that he put his hands on me and threatened to beat me into the ground and stab me (which he also told me I was over exaggerating about when I called the cops on him) I’m finally seeing all the red flags at once and it’s overwhelming.

Used to be maybe once a week they have these shouting matches but now it's become 2 or 3 times a week. Occasionally I hear stuff being slammed and can make out what they're saying. A lot of ""YOU FUCKING LIED!!"" or ""GET THE FUCK OUT!!"" etc. Today I could hear stuff clearly being thrown. I'm afraid this will end in domestic violence at some point. Called the cops today after months of this, basically unless they're at the door hearing stuff there's not much they can really do and with coronavirus they'll only respond to emergencies.

fisow5,How to explain to my kids that their mommy and daddy are done,"I[26F] left my abusive fiancé[36M] 3 months ago. We’ve been together for a long time. We have three daughters 
7,5, and 5 months. I am scared to let him get visitation but my kids keep asking for him. I know he wouldn’t hurt our children but I am afraid of what he’ll do to get me back &amp; I don’t trust myself to stand my ground if I had to be around him right now. 

I left because he blacked my eye and busted my nose. I don’t even remember why. I left when he went to work and never looked back.

 I moved in with a friend to a city nearby. Literally about 15/20 min away. It’s not far but I’ve been able to keep distance from him and he doesn’t know her or where she lives. Surprisingly he hasn’t called me repeatedly or anything for the last 3 weeks but I know he’s going to do something else to try to get in contact with me. 

Also, I don’t want to, but I may have to cut contact with his mother. She doesn’t know where I moved but she’s been sympathetic and has respected why I left her son. She’s been nothing but help and has really done a lot for me. She’s prayed with me over the phone, helped me financially, been a motherly figure for me (because mine doesn’t talk to me since I’ve been with him),and gave me hope when I felt like I wanted to give up. She says that she would wants us back together but she’s not going to pressure me to be with him because his behavior. 

She told me he called and said he needed to see me and the kids. She said she told him she hasn’t heard from us. The reason I think I need to cut off contact with her for a while is because that’s her son and I feel like she’s going to eventually side with him. 

The main thing weighing on me is my babies. My 7 year olds birthday was last week and my friend got her a cake and bought her a game on her Xbox. My daughter is used to getting more or having a party for her birthday. She was really sad telling me she was bored and wanted to be with her daddy. My 5 year old was the closest to him and she really misses her dad. They complain about why we can’t go home all the time. It gets me very emotional and I miss him when they bring him up and I hope that maybe in the future he can have a relationship with them but I absolutely can not be around him any time soon if I’m gonna be adamant about this. 

I feel bad because right now I don’t have the means to give them what they’re used to. I use my money that I had in my savings from being with him solely for saving so we can move and making sure they have necessities. Having a small baby really makes it difficult to have money for any extra stuff. My friend is working on getting me a job at her workplace soon so I’m hopeful about that.

I just wanted advice on how to explain our living situation with my kids and explain to them why we won’t see their father right now or be going “home”. 

I spend a lot of time thinking about the future so I won’t spend time thinking about him and I know it sounds bad but I try my best to tune my children out when they complain about him and where we live now. I know that’s not effective but it’s been helping me get through the days and skip over the hard conversation I need to have with them. I’ve been depressed, exhausted and overthinking since I left him.

fitm2q,Want to help a work colleague,"This morning at work, my colleague (let's call her Sam, not her name) was 10 minutes late. It's just her and myself working today, so I was a little peeved that she was late (again). When she got here she apologized and said she had an argument with her partner. I asked her if everything was alright and she looked at me and said ""Can I ask you a question, Does (partner's name) have any right to be angry about me sleeping with someone four years ago?"" Considering I know that Sam and her partner have barely been together 18 months I reply with ""of course he doesn't, no one has a right to be angry with who you've been with four years ago!"" Then she proceeded to tell me about how he keeps hacking into her phone (she keeps changing the pincode and has fingerprint access but he uses her finger when shes asleep and keeps working out her pincodes) and how all morning he's been calling her ""disgusting"" ""disgusting slut"" . At this point she was in tears. I told her that what he's doing is abuse. She kept crying and stating that she hadn't done anything wrong, which I assured her is the truth!
I believe the reason they are even still together is because not long after meeting, she found out she was pregnant (with his child). As far as I know, he's not active in the care of the 9month old but he does have her alone on Sundays while Sam is at work. This has just started as she just came off maternity leave a couple weeks ago. Last week he ""forgot"" to feed the baby for the 6+ hours that Sam was at work and complained that all the baby did was cry and sleep and then when Sam got angry at him for not feeding her he told Sam that it was no big deal and that she didn't die and that Sam was overreacting.

Sam isn't the brightest bulb on the bush but she is sweet and kind and lovely (even if she was an evil bitch witch) she doesn't deserve this!

fivefs,I'm tired,"I left 3 months ago. I still miss and love him. I would have gone back if not for the giant support system around me and I don't want to disappoint them. I know I'm in love with an illusion but I'm having a hard time letting go. He's an asshole. He calls me terrible names. He's strangled me, spit on me. Theres no reason to ever return. 

Yet, I can't help but think about the good times and feel like I'm overreacting. 

I'm going to go for custody soon and I know he will be livid and I will be scared and we probably will never talk again.

fivoks,My past may ruin my future,"I am a 21 year old young lady who has had horrible experiences in the past with an ex boyfriend. These events are traumatic and I feel as if what happened is possibly coming in between the wonderful relationship my current boyfriend &amp; I have. 
 
I am a victim of domestic violence experienced at a very young age (19) and never got help, never spoke about the situation to Anyone. I always felt as if it was a very embarrassing,humiliating, shameful topic and I’ve never sought to seek professional help. 

I thought everything was good, finally after 2 years of the traumatic experience I felt ready for a relationship &amp; we seem to be very in love and we have a great connection going. 

Here is the thing, after the occurrence I became very insecure with myself. I feel as if I am not capable of love and others are not capable of loving me. I feel as if any girl is better than I am because they haven’t gone through certain things and in my mind they are innocent from the evils of this world. 

My boyfriend comes from a very happy home. His life, in a sense could be ideal. He is nowhere near damaged. 

I’m scared that the pieces I have that are a complete utter mess might cause him to distance himself from me.

fixuad,He blamed everybody but himself.,"My ex constantly blamed me for his actions and abusive tendencies. If it wasn’t me that day, he would blame his friends, he would blame his co workers, he would blame his parents, he would blame his exes, he would never ever look inward and understand that he is responsible for his actions and emotions. I broke up with him recently (Monday) and I am missing him so much it hurts. I feel like I’m wrong for missing him though, because if it wasn’t me it would have been the next girl. I never meant anything to him. He wanted to marry me, he called me the love of his life, all of that and I was stupid enough to believe it even when he started telling me he wanted to hit me and called me things I would never even think of calling somebody I’m involved with. He was arrested on Monday when I called the cops after he threatened to beat my head in and stab me. I don’t regret calling the cops and I don’t regret breaking up with him. I miss him. I miss him telling me how much he loves me but I don’t think he ever did. I think he’s a liar and a master manipulator and I feel so stupid for never seeing the red flags, especially since I grew up in an abusive household I thought I would know. I was never abused by a romantic partner before though. He was the first person outside of my family to do this to me. I am shocked. I love him so much.

fj3qnj,What do I do?,"Hi, posting from a throwaway account as I want this to be anonymous....

Apologies for the long post in advance. I just need some outside perspective and advice.

I'm 23F. My partner is 31M. We've been together since I was 17. He was living with his 'ex' when I first started seeing him, but assured me they were broken up. About a year in, I found out they were still together. I told him to make a choice. He chose me, moved out of the flat he shared with his ex, left her everything they owned together, and moved in with his father.

We took a gap year before going to uni and this is where the problems started. He started to blame me for losing everything in his life. He became depressed and suicidal and said it was all my fault and I guess, in a way it was because I told him he had to move out with his ex if he wanted to be with me. I couldn't handle his emotions (I'm on the autism spectrum and emotions are really difficult for me to understand or/or process). For a short-period of time, I self-harmed and attempted to overdose because I felt like there was no escape from it. My mother found out and blamed my partner, and they had a big argument. After the tempers went down and I stopped doing that stuff, my mother offered to bury the hatchet with my partner but he refused and they have never spoken since. I've asked him to come over to our house many times, but he refuses to and tries to turn me against my mother. He also refuses to introduce me to his family as he is ashamed of my age. His family and friends do not know he has a girlfriend. 

We then went to uni. I moved into student digs and he stayed with his father. I felt like I couldn't participate in Freshers, go out for a drink, join clubs etc. He never came out and said I could not, and even told me I should, but then would always end the sentence with 'but it's not something you would enjoy and I wouldn't like you as a person if you did'. I failed to make any friends at uni.

His granddad died and then his mother started drinking heavily. He became really suicidal and everytime I suggest he see a doctor or therapist to help him get through it, he would get aggressive (not physically) and say that I was just passing the problem onto someone else because I didn't care enough for him to fix it myself. 

He then started to threaten me with suicide whenever he didn't want me to do something. I wanted to break up with him as I was extremely unhappy, but every time I tried to break it off he would tell me he would kill himself.

It kept getting worse. He would drive to my house in the middle of the night drunk. He would lock me in his car and drive recklessly saying he could kill us both. He was and still is actively trying to get me fired because he doesn't want me to do the PhD I am currently doing now.

Up into this point he had never laid a finger on me. In fact, between all of this he is one of the nicest people you will meet. He will go above and beyond for me and anyone else. I feel stupid for complaining because we did have good times, and he did treat me right.

Then, two days ago, I went out with some people in my office. It was the first time since I've met him that I went out someone who isn't him. He started texting me the usual stuff, demanded I go home and rung me non-stop. In the end, my friend realised I was upset over my phone, took it off me and put it on aeroplane mode.

I stayed out a bit longer, and shared a taxi home with a (male) friend because we live close by. I got out the taxi, waved goodbye, and as soon as the taxi left my partner appeared. He'd been waiting in his car outside my house. He was drunk. He grabbed me, pinned me against the wall and took my phone and house keys off me. He started screaming at me and accusing me of sleeping with the guy I had shared the taxi with. He said he was going to kill us. I tried to get away from him, but I couldn't get in my house or call anyone for help as he had my keys and phone. 

He dragged me to his car and said he was driving me away. I did my best to escape but couldn't.

He started to strangle me. I slapped him to try and get him off me. He then pushed me to the ground and started shouting at me for hitting him.

Luckily, my roommate happened to walk past at this moment. My partner dropped me, and then started to tell my roommate that I was abusing him. My roommate didn't know what to make of the situation but saw me on the floor trying to recover my breathing. He got my phone and keys returned and saw me inside, then asked if I wanted to call the police (I didn't).

Partner then started to text me saying he loved me and for me to come back outside and talk things through properly. He said he wouldn't leave until I came out and spoke to him.

I ended up ringing my mother to pick me up and am now staying at her house. He's still texting me. He says it's just a misunderstanding and that he never meant to strangle me. His exact words were 'I was only trying to usher you inside the house'. He's being really nice over text (I haven't responded to any). He's asking to still be friends. I don't know what to do. He's never really been physical before and it is out of character.

We know the same people, he knows my schedule, we work close by (he's also doing a PhD). We even share a supervisor and he's already been telling our supervisor (made up) bad things about me in an attempt to get me fired. I'm worried what the fallout of this will be if I don't go back to him, but I'm too scared to even see him again. I'm still having difficulties breathing two days later, and finding it difficult to eat and drink as my throat hurts when I swallow.

Am I overreacting? After this, there is no way I will ever continue this relationship, but would it be bad of me to cut contact? He needs mental help. How do I handle the work situation? I don't want anyone to know about this.",throwaway_96135,2020-03-15 09:16:12,29,1172,27.84,62.71,63.29,7.22,15.03,13.74,94.88,63.23,24.83,20.82,11.18,1.02,0.43,7.76,0.43,4.01,4.01,15.44,9.39,3.75,8.36,2.3,21.25,2.99,1.79,0.85,0.51,0.85,4.52,1.37,2.99,0.43,0.94,0.43,18.43,0.85,1.45,0.6,8.02,11.43,1.62,1.28,2.73,2.22,1.45,3.16,2.56,0.51,1.54,0.51,1.71,0.43,0.6,0,0.6,10.07,4.1,1.37,2.73,1.37,1.37,9.13,8.96,1.37,17.58,3.07,7.85,6.83,1.19,0.68,1.19,0.09,0,0.68,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,15.1,6.57,3.24,0,0,0.34,0,0.26,0,3.41,1.19,0.09
fj8hmg,How do I get over my abusive ex-boyfriend?,"Dear Reddit
I have recently found the courage and capability to leave my physically and emotionally abusive boyfriend. Throughout our 2 1/2 year relationship, he has managed to isolate me from my dearest friends. He has kicked me in the middle of the road, ripped out my hair, humiliated me in front of his friends, destroyed my self esteem and also slapped me in the middle of heated arguments that had little merit. He was controlling, read my messages, insisted on prioritising him over my career and has somehow made it seem like all of this was my fault.
I recently realised he was a textbook abuser. He may not have been the kind to kill me in a fit of fury, but he certainly was not pleasant to deal with. I found a way to reconnect with some old friends who offered me their place to stay since he doesn't know where they live and therefore cannot come by to my house to scream at/hurt me.
While I am coping well with a willing support system, I feel extremely ashamed at what I put myself through (even though he's the one who should be ashamed). I wanted us to part on decent terms but he has threatened me with legal action in case I try to ruin his reputation. He always finds a way to bother me. I also feel like an emotional burden on my friends though I don't belive they've ever tried to make me feel that way. 
I feel lost. I have been drinking through the entire week. I feel alone because some of his friends became my friends, and they have all blocked me. I don't know what lies he must have told them but it has certainly made me feel alone. I desperately want to consult a therapist. But I can't even afford it. 
If there's someone out there who can help me in some way... Please help me. I always thought myself as a smart, independent and strong woman but now...

fjb5po,Help me! I am a “victim” that does not want the “perpetrator” to be locked up,"My boyfriend is an alcoholic. He has dreams of success and will do anything to get there, unless it requires no alcohol. Two days ago, we were drinking and having a good night when he got upset and jealous that I went to the post office with a coworker (because I had to know how to do this for my new job!!) and was telling him about things my coworker has told me about, like quantum physics and other stupid shit. I didn’t expect it to be a fight, but that’s what happened. He started getting upset, so I left the room and went upstairs. He followed me. After that, we continued to verbally argue and yell at each other. During this time, the neighbors called the police and told them specific words he had said. These words were threatening to me and my family and at the time he was holding a knife. He did not harm me in anyway with the knife, however. He did punch me on my legs, which I had a red mark after, after I bit him. Shit went down. Eventually, the cops showed up and immediately took me outside of my apartment. He was still inside, and at least four police officers ran inside to get him. I talked to the police and told them what had happened. They did tell me what the neighbors heard, which was something he said. I admitted to him saying those things. I was afraid at that point and told them I was afraid. They told me he would be booked on a misdemeanor domestic assault. That night, I saw his charges were much worse than just that. He is being charged with two felonies related to what the neighbor heard and the fact that he was holding a knife. 

I do not want him to be in jail. I know that it would be the end of his life to be in jail for anytime after his hearing. He has had a prior domestic violence in a different state, around 5 years ago. Is there anything I can do as the “victim” to help him get out of jail? Currently, he is being held until his first court hearing which is 4 days after being arrested. The police issued a no contact against my will and I am no longer able to speak to him. Luckily for me, I am speaking to one of his family members that is able to talk to him. Without that, I would be in a hole of depression. Knowing he is sitting in jail where he does not belong is killing me inside. Knowing that I told the police that night what exactly happened is also killing me inside. I wish I hadn’t said what I did. I wish that it didn’t escalate to this position, but here we are. 

I need to know what I can do as the “victim” to get him out of jail and prevent him from jail time. I want this for him. I want him to get better in regards to his alcoholism. I don’t know what to do. What can I do??",Australian-Teddy,2020-03-15 16:49:25,9,545,32.41,53.67,30.75,1.09,13.29,13.39,94.31,64.77,24.59,16.7,8.81,0.55,0,6.42,0.92,7.89,5.5,14.86,12.48,3.12,5.32,2.2,22.02,3.85,2.57,2.75,1.28,0.73,4.77,0.73,4.04,0.92,2.02,0.18,14.68,0.37,0.92,0,6.61,8.26,1.47,0.37,2.02,0.92,0.55,2.94,2.57,0.55,2.02,0,1.47,0.55,0.73,0,0.73,8.07,2.39,0.92,3.12,2.02,0.55,9.91,10.46,1.1,13.21,0.92,6.61,5.5,2.39,1.47,1.65,0,0,0.37,0.55,0.37,0,0,0,0.18,13.94,6.61,3.49,0,0,0.55,0.55,0,1.47,0.92,0.37,0
fjbfr3,I feel like I'm going crazy,"I've known this guy since I was 10 years old (I'm nearly 22) my family took him in and helped raise him. He punched me in face when i was roughly 10-11 years old and he was 15-16. Before christmas last year he moved into the house that I share with my dad and young sibling. He has been very violent towards me, left me with bruises and has verbally abused me on multiple occasions. He will start on me and then turn it on me saying that I started it, making me feel like I'm going crazy. I'm always to blame when it comes to problems. My family joke around a lot but take shit way too far, I've copped shit from everyone around me majority of my life and I'm severely depressed and I have anxiety as well. I can't emotionally and mentally handle the ""harsh jokes"" because they take it too far. I struggle every day I'm in that house not to self harm, they make me feel unwanted and un-loved. He says that I play mind games with his head but I don't understand how the hell I'm doing that. 
When he's mad at me he will threaten to hurt my friends because I've said something that makes him angry. He threatens them because he knows it hurts me and I could never live with myself if my friends did actually get hurt by him! I went away for 2 weeks about a month or so ago and he kept messaging me, constantly nagging me to go home and accusing me of doing drugs and hanging around blokes when I was actually at my best friend of 10 years, helping her and seeing her children!!! I didn't do anything that even remotely concerned him, I told him multiple times that he needed to pull the fuck up because he wasn't my boyfriend and that he wasn't to control anything I did!! My Life, I deal with the consequences if anything were to go wrong!!!! I would be messaging my ""guy friends"" and he would look over my shoulder and get up me for literally just talking to them!

fjc6a1,It fustrates me how his mental abuse still holds me back,"Dad - Kevin (fake name)  
Also, I'm sorry for making this post long and some spelling mistakes I might make (english is my 2nd language)  


First of all I want to clarify why I choose to give my ""dad"" a fake name and not just call him ""dad"" compared to my mom and brother. I'm not comfortable calling him my ""dad"" as I'm trying to make it clear to myself mainly that he can never be that father figure that I strongly wish for.

So to begin with I'm turning 20 this year and was adopted at an age of 1. I also got ADHD which made me quite energetic and difficult to keep tabs on. Kevin didn't really show many noticable... odd signs/red flags in the beginning, though I do remember some through the youngest years of my life where he would grab me by the back of my neck to make me listen and do as he told me to. Honestly, I found it frightening and is probably one of the main reasons I never had a great bond/relationship with him. I grew up being scared of my own ""dad"" even though I forgot this most of the time back then, but there were moments where he would get mad or start to and I would be scared thinking; ""He is scary, I don't want to make him angry.""

When I was 13 I thought he was going to hit me. I had never experienced that before and was the first time I thought he would hit me, but he didn't. I was watching TV with him and my mom came up to me telling me to clean my room. I didn't want to as I really hated cleaning my room and started arguing a bit with her about doing it another time. My dad had a sore back that day (and he had a sore back alot because of an operation), but it still hadn't dawned on me how bad things could get. He was usually irritable and really grumpy when that was the case and I had experienced several times that he wasn't very nice during those times. Of course it was scary with how unpredictable that made him, but I tried to teach myself not to care about what he said when he was grumpy like that.

(Also, this part might be a bit choppy and sound weird. My memory is a bit hazy about this incident and I only got some clear parts). Since he was in a bad mood he obviously butted in and started chewing me out saying stuff like he'll take my room away and that it shouldn't have been given to me. Now me being that stupid girl I was I obviously stared right at him thinking ""I don't care what he says, he's just in a bad mood just saying things to scare me"". Which was a bad move. He didn't like the way I looked at him/the look in my eyes and started shouting at me not to look at him that was, to which I answered ""I'm not looking at you in any particular way"". This caused him to go absolutely crazy mad and shouted at me saying ""there it is again"" and proceeded to slam the tabe with his left hand and lean forward with his right hand raised. I remember his eyes. How bloodshot and wild they looked. I was so scared and startled to cry and hyperventilate. I also remember that the moment my first tear fell he looked at me and said in a mockingly/humiliating tone ""Oh, that was cool, lets see if you can do it again. Don't think you can trick me!""

That day, I went to my room terrified of my own ""dad"" and I can't say the next day was any better. I was so scared of bumping into him in the morning that I struggled to get down the staircase and leaned onto the wall while slowly making my way downstairs. When I arrived at school I felt absolutely broken and tired. I coudn't even make it to my first class without having a breakdown crying my eyes out. The worst part is that he didn't even realise how scared I was. When I came home that day he just stood in the hallway the moment I got inside and said with his hands on his hips ""oh man, I was really angry yesterday"" or something like that. I couldn't even look him in his eyes. Ever after that day I was on ""high alert"" whenever I was in the living room or the first floor. I made sure that he didn't have a sore back, tried to do him favours to avoid conflict and walking on eggshells just so I wouldn't create a situation.

However he did apologize 1yr and a half after when I mentioned how scary it was for me, but some time later when I said it was difficult for me to be around him, he couldn't fathom why. I said because of what happened a while back and he answered lightheartedly ""oh that old thing? You should've been over that by now"". It really hurt, because it had affected me deeply and I am honestly still affected by what happened. I feel like I get dragged back to the feeling of being helpless and scared whenever someone raises their voice out of nowhere. For example: if my bf gets upset while playing a video game with me I get startled and scared to the point I don't feel ""safe"" and not comfortable with playing more games.

Luckily for me my mom chose to divorce him when I was around 15/16 or so. If not for me and my brother she probably would have, but she was scared for us and how it would turn out if she did. I don't blame her for waiting. I'm in fact happy that she chose to do it when she did because if not me and my older brother (also adopted) would have been alone with him. I'm also grateful that my mom was strong enough to hold out with a person like that for me and my brother even though she also got mentally abused. In fact, everyone got manipulated and pulled along as some dolls in Kevins own puppetshow. I won't go into more detail on things that have happened, unless I'm asked, but to this day his behaviour and actions have affected me deeply. Most issues I have, I can trace back to my childhood and as mentioned in the title, I'm fustrated how I struggle because of everything. My self worth is in the drain and I'm overly sensitive when it comes to peoples voices and what tones they have. If I notice even a slight change that might signal they're getting impatient, fustrated or anything like that I feel worried and anxious. I take the blame for everything and things everything is my fault. I know I'm just 20, but I wish all of this didn't play such a big part in my life and my mental health.",tebahplAzyx,2020-03-15 17:56:40,2,1211,13.08,23.87,73.07,2.48,22.02,12.3,93.64,62.59,23.12,16.76,11.31,0.17,0.33,4.71,0.25,6.36,3.88,12.47,9.74,7.6,9.83,2.73,19.57,5.78,2.06,2.64,1.07,1.9,6.85,1.98,4.62,2.06,1.07,0.5,10.32,1.4,0.08,1.07,5.28,13.87,1.98,2.81,2.15,2.89,1.65,3.88,4.05,1.65,1.32,0.91,1.65,0.74,0.74,0,0.17,5.04,0.83,0.83,1.32,1.32,0.83,7.84,7.6,0.74,14.37,1.57,6.77,6.94,0.41,0.58,0.5,0.08,0,0,0.58,0,0.08,0.25,0.25,0,13.71,4.46,2.23,0.08,0.08,0.08,0.08,0.08,2.31,3.06,0.83,0.41

The point is he kept saying he has never hurt me. I also have no evidence to get back to him.

He used to have criminal record of sexual abuse when he was young but he ended up innocent. So I’m afraid that if I report him, everything will be the same. He is innocent and I turn to be lying crazy woman.

fji7fn,How do I get an abusive man moved out?,"hi there! I’m gonna try to make this short but basically I’m (F, 17) wondering how to get my mom’s (F, 52) abusing boyfriend (M, 62) to move out. 

So my mom has been with this guy for 8 years. Throughout the relationship my mom has said that she’s broken up with him so the 8 years is kind of “iffy” but she doesn’t want him to live here anymore. She’s told him multiple times to move out throughout the years but he just stays. He doesn’t pay rent and he’s not on the lease. I myself have never liked this man and I’ve called the police on him twice during their relationship (one for drug possession and abuse, and the second one for abuse as well) and those calls didn’t make a dent in him leaving. 

He’s abused my mom mentally for years but physically twice, which I’ve been around to witness. Well the 2nd physical abuse moment happened yesterday and I almost called the police, I really was going to but right when I was going to.. my mom’s friend shows up. I should’ve called but my two experiences with the police in my small Minnesotan town were hopeless so I didn’t. What I want to happen is to get this man out, ASAP. He doesn’t deserve my mother and never has. 

My mom and I have plotted different ideas to get him out once and for all but I really think with all I have stacked against him, I could just call the police and he’d be sent away in a snap. Now, that’s what I want more than ever but it’s never that easy. Would I be able to just call and get him out of here with probable cause just like that? I really want it to be. I’ve also thought of moving out all his stuff while he’s gone since my mom has asked him nicely to start moving out and he hasn’t moved an inch. I despise this man and I want him as many light years away from my mom as possible. I just want it all to be over. 

To summarize: I want my mom’s abusive boyfriend moved out and need answers and ideas for this to work.

fjx4pz,How to be okay with leaving?,"Recently, my partner of two years became increasingly abusive. Emotional volatility and abuse has been a routine part of our fights the entire time we’ve been together, but it became physical about two months ago. It was horrific abuse that threatened my life, and yet we have gotten back together. Right after the incident I got a protection order (which they were later arrested for violating) but I still ended up going back. They were suspended from the university we attend together pending a full investigation for violence and stalking, but while we have been on good terms they have coerced me into lying to cover up everything for them. They have been volatile and snap at me over tiny problems. Last night while fighting they took my phone, intimated me into unlocking it, and deleted my social media (only contact with friends that are very important to me) saying “when did i give you permission to use that?”. I’m exhausted. In trying to stay safe I packed an emergency safety bag to keep in a safe location and while doing that I had a bit of a breakdown realizing that this just isn’t a way to live. I love this person. I adore them with my entire heart and they are so ingrained in my daily life that I genuinely cannot imagine living without them. But it just isn’t worth it. They only got severely physical once but I have constant nightmares about it, and flashbacks where I swear I can physically feel their hands around my neck strangling me. I thought we could salvage our relationship but they still get so angry and treat me horribly and just hearing the slightest anger in their voice makes me fully breakdown. We fought again last night and I shut down fully. We slept in the same bed together and I laid there fully awake for 8 hours because I couldn’t relax enough to fall asleep. I don’t know how to be okay without them but this is destroying me. I don’t feel like myself, everything feels so wrong. I just want them to love me again without hurting me. I want it all to stop. How do I move on and build a life without them in it without feeling lost, isolated, and hopeless?",lavendercals,2020-03-16 19:06:19,5,390,19.84,42.87,97.27,1.51,17.73,18.46,92.31,58.21,21.79,16.67,10,2.31,0.26,0,4.1,5.13,3.59,12.05,8.21,7.44,8.21,2.82,17.18,4.1,1.28,1.54,1.03,1.28,9.23,3.08,6.15,0.51,3.08,1.03,12.31,0,0.77,0,0,11.03,2.82,1.54,1.28,0.26,1.28,3.85,2.56,0,1.03,1.54,4.1,1.28,2.31,0,0,11.54,4.87,0.51,2.82,1.54,2.05,5.9,8.72,0.26,17.18,1.79,8.46,7.44,0.51,0.26,0.26,0.51,0,0,0.51,0,0,0.51,0,0,11.79,5.13,2.56,0,0,0.77,0,0,0.51,1.79,1.03,0
fjxn5n,My (M17) abused gf (F15),"Hi, this is going to be a really important long post.
My gf, who i have a long distance relationship with, has been sexually and verbally abused at a young age by her mom's ex, who, last week, drove her home from her mom's house (her parents are divorced)
As you can see, this was really thraumatic for her,she had to stay almost an hour with a man who abused her.
After this time, she told it to her father, bur her father didn't care, and didn't even talk to her mother. He didn't even called the police over this event.
This has been so tough for her, since she has been told by that man she was worthless and a sl*t, that it lead her to suicidal thoughts all over the last weeks.
And even then, her parents grounded her, just for making a small joke about coronavirus 
They yet didn't present a formal acussation and have no plans on doing so, every 2 weeks, HER FATHER LETS HER MOTHER TO TAKE HER TO HER HOUSE, WHERE OCASSIONALY HER EX COMES TO, AND EVEN HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS NEXT DOOR.
I need your help, she lives in the US, New york, Staten Island, but i live in Bolivia, so sadly i can't do too much.
All i need is information about the following:
-Is there a way to get her to a shelter for teenages, like a foster home or something similar in STATEN ISLAND or MANHATTAN? If so, could you tell me how to contact them through facebook?
-Is there a way to denounce this crime from an american embassy?
-What should i do to calm her until then?
-what do i do to help her regarding her self-harming habits she's got these weeks?

fk2xxm,Abusive Ex Girlfriend,"Thanks for hearing me out. I have an abusive ex gf that I currently live with. Last night we got into an argument as I was trying to rekindle our relationship (I know right) anyway we got into an argument and she was doing all the screaming and rude gestures. Anyway I told her that I think it would be best for me just to fly down and see my family as tickets are fairly cheap right now with all the corona virus going on. 

She goes off the walls saying I’m putting everyone at risk. Blah blah blah. Now normally I would take extra steps to be careful but we just got back from San fransico and Los Angeles last week so the exposure level is already high. Anyway, I tried to walk away from the situation and head to the room in the basement. She follows me and starts yelling at me. Then she says if i go and I’m back within 8 weeks she’ll “murder me” for putting everyone at risk. Mind you I already had a business trip that got postponed this week. She then throws a backpack at me, then starts shoving me, followed by punching. This is about the 3rd time this happened in the last couple months.

Considering we live with each other our lease isn’t up for another 6 months, plus she has a daughter (18months) I’m trying to play the nice card and try to be separated then she can save up money and leave. But tensions are getting high and I’m actually starting to get worried myself. Should I terminate the contract by filing a restraining order. She would be responsible for the remaining portion of the rent. Or do I just suck it up and wait for the couple months to ride out? I’ve been trying to avoid calling the police about this as she’ll most likely be arrested and I’m trying to avoid that and put less stress on her child.",hawaii_brian,2020-03-17 03:24:41,2,336,57.09,57.1,85.62,1.14,16.8,15.48,92.86,56.55,17.86,13.69,8.04,1.79,0.3,3.57,0,4.17,6.55,14.88,9.23,4.76,7.74,0.3,21.43,3.57,1.79,0,0.6,2.98,6.25,1.49,4.76,2.08,2.38,0,10.71,0.6,0.6,4.17,0,8.33,0.89,0,1.79,2.98,1.19,2.38,1.79,0.3,1.49,0,0.89,0.3,0.6,0,0,11.9,2.98,2.08,3.27,2.68,1.49,4.17,13.1,2.08,21.43,5.06,8.63,8.04,0.89,0.89,1.19,1.49,0,0.3,2.98,0.3,0.3,0,0,1.79,11.31,5.36,1.19,0,0,0.3,0,0,0.6,2.68,1.19,0
fk2ydp,My girlfriend's brother is abusive.,"So me and my girlfriends relationship are long distance. I live in Canada and she lives in Bulgaria. So for the time I've known her. Her and her mother have been physically and mentally abusive from the older brother. They all live together. The problem is that her mother is in denial of what he's doing wrong. That ""he needs a girlfriend or he needs a job and he'll be fine"". I also learnt that he's mentally unstable (which makes sense). The other day he's beaten the both of them. My girlfriend wanted to call the police but her mother insisted not to. It's an ongoing thing. I don't know what to do. I can't physically be there or put some sense into her mother.

fk6n67,What now? I (25 F) am weighing my options to deal with my partner (28 M),"Hello all,

I made a post in /relationships and was referred here after my post. The short of the story is my partner put his hands around my neck (didn't squeeze) and yanked my hair after an argument. He has done similar things in the past, such as raising a fist to me to intimidate. He's also been violent with others and has admitted to trying to actively murder someone who was abusive in the past.

Needless to say, this terrifies me and this feels like an escalation and I am not sure I can continue with this. Initially he was very unapologetic and told me I should feel embarrassed for making him do that. I've left to stay with my parents for awhile a couple hours away, and now he's overapologizing and has suddenly decided to go to therapy. Though he suddenly is denying any of this happened. He said he never put his hand on me, he just put it NEAR my neck, and he's saying that he never pulled my hair. He apparently just disassociated, his hand was numb and it just accidentally got caught in my hair. It seems like gaslighting to me. 

I will have to return to my home at some point (we live together and we're in a lease for another year and both our names are on the lease.) I do work from home so it's a possibility I could go back and get my stuff and live with my parents, though I'd probably still be responsible for the lease. Or I could go back and try to live with him for the remainder. I'm not sure how safe this is, and I'm worried I might fall right back into the role of being a girlfriend and potentially get physically harmed. 

What are people's recommendations for this sort of thing? I've never been in this situation and I feel really lost.",Similar_Special,2020-03-17 07:57:33,12,335,21.62,45.25,71.89,6.12,17.63,14.63,94.03,64.18,22.39,15.82,10.15,0.9,0,4.78,0,6.57,4.78,14.33,11.34,8.06,7.46,1.79,21.79,2.69,1.79,1.19,0.6,1.79,4.18,1.19,2.99,0.9,1.49,0.3,12.24,0.6,0.9,0,4.78,11.64,2.09,0.9,0.9,4.18,1.79,2.39,2.99,0,0.9,2.09,3.28,1.49,1.49,0,0.3,6.27,3.28,1.49,0.3,0.9,0.3,6.27,13.13,0.9,15.52,2.99,6.87,6.27,0.6,0,1.49,0.9,0,0.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.33,4.78,2.69,0,0,0.6,0,0,0,3.58,2.39,0.3

fkbx1y,Defeated once again,"I’ve posted here a while ago, and unfortunately I’m posting again because I need to vent.. so my “fiancé” (31M) and I (23F) got into yet again, another huge fight. Over something small. When he gets mad he goes from 0-100, fast. He kept going on, and I ended up shutting the bedroom door in his face. That was followed by him saying “you’re such a worthless piece of shit, you’re just like your mom” long story short, I can not stand my mother, and he knows it. He then ended up running towards me like he was going to hit me, and our two year old saw it and started SCREAMING. My fiancé then says “look what you’ve done!” So I picked him up and was holding him while he was still saying horrible things, and he kicked me. While I was holding him. He wouldn’t get out of my face and kept grabbing onto me so I punched him a few times (I know, bad on my part, but when he does this is when he usually gets really physical and I didn’t want him to, and I was so angry) then he says to our son “look what Mama  just did!” I told him this is not happening anymore and that I’ll call the police, he then says “who has marks on their face??” And literally denied ever getting in my face, or kicking me. Even though he had just done it seconds earlier. This is the first time our son has ever really seen our fights and I’m absolutely heart broken and beating myself up for it. And lately when our son is upset he’ll run away from me and push me away and go to dad. I can’t take the thought of our son growing up and seeing this stuff. And it’s even worse because I can’t just up and leave. My fiancé has a good paying job, if I called the police on him (I also have proof of past abuse) it would ruin his life. Then what am I going to do? I don’t have money. I don’t have a job. I don’t have anything. I know he’d never hurt our son. But I still don’t want him seeing this shit, and I’m sick of being treated like dirt. It always ends with him profusely apologizing until it happens again tomorrow. Every. Single. Time. I told him I’d rather him beat the shit out of me than say what he says to me. He said “they’re just words” I feel like I’m failing as a mom, a fiancé, and a person.

fkf6nn,Is this something to file a police report about?,"A little more than a year ago, after a really hard time in our lives, my husband told me that he had seriously thought about taking us all in our van and driving us off of a cliff to kill us all. 

The other day he said in front of the kids that whenever he thinks about killing the kids, he looks at one of them and thinks they're too cute. It was meant to be kind of humorous but considering everything else, it's not that funny and he shouldn't have said it in front of them.

He sometimes tells the kids or says to me in front of the kids that we should give them up for adoption or that we should have taken them to Planned Parenthood. 

 Sometime in the last week or so he said that if we moved up to my parents house, he would want to kill my sister's miserable dog that lives there and buy our own dog. 

He has told me a few times about how he hated his dad when he was young and thought about killing him. 

He freely admits to having killed and abused animals for the fun of it when he was younger. 

He keeps bugging me to ask my family if he can buy a gun off of them in case someone breaks into the house. But I'm afraid of what he would do if he had a gun and was depressed, angry, or really upset. 

Several times he has raised his hand to me, acting like he wanted to slap me (sometimes when I was pregnant) when I said things he didn't like or called him out on bad behavior. 

He has gently thrown things at me, some of them hitting me, when I have said things he didn't like or called him out on bad behavior.

2. That I would be taken to give a video statement and then get a rape it at the hospital
3. That I wouldn't be able to return to my home after until the police finished their investigation of the crime scene
4. That I wouldn't be informed when I was allowed to return home, but just told ""in one to three days""
5. That I was actually able to return home that morning, but no one informed me so I waited at a friend's house, worried about my cat and home, for far longer than necessary.
6. That a summary of my video statement would be read out loud in a crowded courtroom that included strangers (who heard my full name) and friends.  This summary statement would include what type of penetration was done to me against my consent.
7. That my ex would plan his suicide, and then when the surety took him to a courthouse to revoke surety because she didn't feel safe with him and was worried he would kill himself, the police would refuse to take him into custody because he had done nothing wrong.
8. That instead of taking him into custody, they dropped him off at a hospital overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients
9. That after that the police were unable to tell me where he went or even if he was still in police custody.  One person I spoke to said he was, the next person said he wasn't.

fkkjjm,Every few months... Need advice.,"I've been with my partner for almost two years. We have twins that are almost a year old. Our relationship has been sprinkled with violence since the beginning. Nothing on the extreme end, it only happens every few months, and it usually (but not always) accompanies alcohol. The first time he laid his hands on me in anger, I was pregnant, and he shoved me onto a bed. He admits it was wrong, but always follows with ""but it was onto a soft surface"". Since then it's mainly been violent outbursts against objects (breaking mirrors, ripping art off of walls, etc) with a few pushes and shoves and ""lighter"" abuse here and there. He's never actually HIT me. 

Last night he came home drunk at midnight then left to walk the dog. I wasn't happy about it (I'm often left to care for the babies alone), so out of pettiness I locked the door behind him. I thought he had his keys with him. My intention was not to lock him out but to put a small annoying obstacle in his way upon returning home. A baby woke, and I went to the bedroom to nurse her. Partner came back while I was trying to get her re-settled and started knocking on the door, gradually getting more insistent until he was banging. I was trying to keep from waking the baby back up.

Finally I was able to get away to open the door for him, and as soon as I unlocked it, he slammed it open in my face then pushed me out of the way. Alarmed, I tried to push him back out the door and close/lock it again, but he pushed his way back into the house, grabbed me by my hair, pulling a chunk out, and slammed me to the ground. I screamed and retreated to the bedroom, locked the door, and comforted my scared babies.

That was the most violent episode yet. I know it's not much comparatively, but it's enough that I'm really, really upset. But what I'm even more upset about than the violence is that HIS version of the story is that I pushed HIM as soon as I opened the door and he threw me to the ground as a response. In fact, pretty much every time I try to talk to him about this type of behavior, he has a twist on the story that basically ""justifies"" his actions (even though he vehemently denies that he's justifying).

What complicates our situation the most is that MOST of the time, we have a really great relationship, and I love being with him. These violent situations are kind of anomalies. In the two years we've been together, something like this has only happened five-ish times, but every time, he'll admit he was wrong AND justify why he did it. His unwillingness/inability to accept FULL responsibility for his actions leaves me with little hope that this problem will go away. And even though it seldom happens, it does often enough that I'm unwilling to have my daughters grow up witnessing it.

I've tried to get him to go to therapy, but he says that type of thing doesn't work for him and what he REALLY needs is a loving, compassionate partner who's willing to help him work through it. I, of course, translate that as ""a partner who's willing to continue being abused while I attempt to address my issues"".

There are, of course, more intricacies, but that's the gist of the situation, and I just need help making sense of it. Leaving the father of my children is a BIG deal that I don't take lightly, and I would like some outside perspective.

fklcmr,I moved back in with him. So disappointed in myself.,"So I moved into another house. He wasn't happy about me moving out. I continued seeing him. He choked me. I stopped seeing him and cut contact completely. During this time at the new house there was ongoing sexual harrassment including grabbing from a male housemate. I tried to resolve it myself, also spoke to landlady, and nothing was done. I broke contact and told abuser about it and he went over there and it caused a fight with him and the male house mate. I moved back in with abuser but in a seperate room. I'm already being so hard on myself. I feel like a complete failure and I'm so disappointed in myself. I know if it had not been for those circumstances I would've have returned. He was great for the first week but since then he has grabbed my upper arm chairs twice, kicked my door, and also tried to get me pregnant when he knows I don't want to be. I have already gotten on birth control against his wishes. I don't know what else to say. I wanted to update. I'm not happy with myself at all right now.

fkmzha,I didn’t press charges nor call the police...,"(In Texas)
My husband came home late March 6th if this year I waited up until 2am to see if he’d make it back I locked the door he kicked it in at 3am
It was loud af , and when he came in the door frame was fkn broken &amp; I was bitching at him breaking the door and being loud. 
We have 2 children 5 &amp; 1   
I was home all evening with my cousin who had a 1 year old daughter. All kids were asleep. 
When my husband kicked in the door she called 911 and hung up. 
Police used gps to dispatch to location and kicked down already broken door. 
I didn’t press assault charges. I didn’t not wore a statement nor sign the police officers statement or report. 
They kept trying to persuade me to press charges but nothing happened to me. 
After saying “I don’t sign anything nor can I confirm or deny anything in an emotional state over &amp; over. 
The officer said can you at least sign  my statement as to what I believe went down this evening?
I refused again, he said wow I’m impressed someone your age (25) knows there right but that’s cool as an officer I CAN press charges.

fkp32a,I (26F) assaulted my ex-FWB (43M) in self defense after years of abuse and my only regret is that I didn’t do it sooner..,"Apologies in advance for any formatting issues - I hope this is the correct thread! Long story short, I resorted to physical violence today and I’m not ashamed to admit it. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Looking back, I had been subjected to extreme emotional abuse by a controlling, jealous, manipulative, possessive and egotistical man. Over an extended period of time, he succeeded in amplifying my existing insecurities and essentially turned me into a shell of my former self. 

During a platonic catch up earlier, he started accusing me of things I hadn’t done and then began to grab the back of my neck and push me around “as a joke” when I didn’t entertain his paranoia. Not long afterwards, he tried to touch me inappropriately and ignored my pleas for him to stop. 

Towards the conclusion of our catch up, he began relentlessly antagonising me and continued to do so despite how distressed I had become as a result. At one point he grabbed me by the throat.. and then I blacked out. I distinctly remember my fist connecting with his face multiple times and a rush of adrenaline surging through my body. Unsurprisingly, the situation escalated  and I’ve only now had a proper chance to reflect on my actions. 

Even though I don’t regret what I did, I’m wondering if it’s ever acceptable to resort to physical violence?

fkt2vi,Is this normal? Or are they right?,"I attempted to leave my partner (who has been emotionally abusive for much of our two year relationship, and physically violent on one recent occasion) yesterday. I have made multiple attempts to leave but always end up being talked into coming back, or coming back on my own due to loneliness and isolation. Yesterday they sent me a few angry text messages about a sensitive topic (upset about ongoing consequences of me reporting the violence to the police) and I ignored them for some time before responding that I was done with the relationship, I was leaving for good and they needed to cease all contact with me immediately. I reacted so quickly (immediately getting in my car with my prepacked safety bag and driving off) because they have been using old abuse tactics lately and I am afraid of it escalating to violence again, but so far it had only happened when we were together so I just sat there and took it and did what I could to appease them. I stopped responding again but would occasionally send back comments about how they have treated me, how afraid I was, etc. When I was sure I was safe to go back home, I did. Hours later they came to knock on my door saying they were worried I had hurt myself because I wasn’t responding (I have issues with self harm and suicidal ideation especially related to their abusive tendencies so this isn’t completely unfounded). We began fighting over the phone and I was saying shitty things about them and the ways they have hurt me and how badly I have been affected by it. I was mostly talking about how much they have blamed me for the consequences of their abuse (police have been involved, there’s an ongoing court case, and disciplinary processes through our university) because they repeatedly tell me I shouldn’t have ever told anyone or reported anything, and have coerced me into lying to protect them. Anyways, now they are pinning the entire fight on me and saying that I was being abusive to them by leaving the way I did and ignoring their texts/calls and refusing to let them know that I was safe. I feel like it was shitty of me to leave so abruptly because they do have extreme anxiety and they don’t have anyone else supporting them, I am all that they really have. But it feels horrible to be called abusive by this person, especially when I was reacting to a cycle of horrible treatment towards me. I just want out of this and I don’t know how to do that when they are continually trying to make me feel guilty for taking the time and space that I know I deserve. This all makes me feel crazy and I don’t know what’s true anymore. I don’t want to hurt them, I really don’t, but I feel like this abuse is never going to stop and even when things are great with us I am constantly afraid of doing something wrong that will set them off and make them spiral into anger. They have promised to never be violent with me again, but I don’t know how to trust that when they had promised it would never happen in the first place and it did. They also say it wasn’t severe abuse (even though they choked me twice and made me feel like I was going to die, gave me a concussion, and stole my personal belongings including house keys before kicking me out in the freezing cold) and don’t seem to understand why that feels so harmful to me. But if I bring any of this up they say it’s just me trying to blame them for my actions. Am I crazy? Am I really abusing them by trying to leave and I just can’t see it? This all feels so unreal at this point and I miss them desperately because I want the the version of them from the good times we had together to come back. I don’t want to hurt them but I can’t live with this much fear.",lavendercals,2020-03-18 10:11:10,8,702,9.32,36.07,90.64,1,29.25,15.95,95.16,63.68,22.51,16.81,10.54,0.85,0,0,5.41,5.7,2.71,12.54,11.4,8.83,9.54,2.42,21.94,4.27,1,2.28,0.57,1.71,8.83,1.71,6.98,1.57,2.85,1,12.11,0,0.28,0,0,14.1,2.28,3.28,1.42,2.28,2.42,3.28,2.99,0.14,0.85,1.99,0.71,0.28,0.43,0,0,5.84,1.85,0.57,0.85,1,1.57,6.84,11.97,0.71,14.25,2.99,4.7,7.41,0.71,0,0.43,0,0,0.28,0.43,0.28,0,0,0,0.14,10.26,2.85,2.56,0,0,0.57,0,0,0,2.42,1.71,0.14
fkyhf1,How I left my last abuser.,"We were in our early 20s and hadn't known each other long but quickly got serious. I ended up needing to stay with him because I had nowhere else to go. He soon became very sexually abusive and controlling. He ended up raping me a few times.  

I was young, naive, and ignorant but I had this strong feeling that I had to keep pretending that everything was fine until I could find a safe way to leave. I also had a strong feeling that he could kill me. 

When I finally decided I had enough and couldn't take it anymore, I told him that he should go back to his mom's house and I should move back in with my family (Who lived across the country) so that we could save up enough money to get a decent place together. 

He readily agreed because the place we were staying at was far too expensive and we were both sick of never having enough money. I made no indication that I was done with the relationship and made sure to talk about how long I would be gone and what the plans were when I would move back. 

I had to leave some stuff behind because I couldn't take it on a plane with me. It was a great excuse for him to hold on to some of my stuff ""for the future"". I made sure to only leave behind what I was okay never getting back again. 

He drove me to the airport when the time came, we said our good byes (even though I hated him, I cried. I didn't understand then but it was probably part of trauma bonding), I got on my plane flight and got safely home. No drama, no safety concerns. 

After a couple months of being back home, I broke up with him. And that was it. He has never tried to come after me. I've been safe from him ever since. 

So simple and easy without being married or having kids. I wish it was that simple this time but without evidence to back up my claims, I can't be sure the legal system will side with me and keep my kids safe from him. 

Though I do get a sense that my husband could do a murder/suicide if the conditions are right, I also feel that if I give him the same promise of a temporary separation for the sake of a better future together, he may be willing to move out and let me have custody of the kids. 

 I would have to be careful what I say and how I say it, but it worked well with the other guy and could work well this time.",MrsResistance,2020-03-18 15:22:25,5,464,15.92,26.6,83.9,66.56,19.33,10.13,95.91,64.66,22.2,15.52,10.34,1.51,0,3.66,0,6.68,5.17,12.28,11.42,7.11,8.62,3.02,22.63,4.53,0.86,2.16,0,1.51,7.54,4.74,2.59,0,1.29,0.43,9.48,0.86,0.22,0.22,4.09,14.87,2.37,2.37,3.45,1.72,2.16,3.88,1.51,0,0.65,0.65,0.86,0,0.43,0.43,0,9.48,2.8,1.08,1.94,2.59,1.29,9.91,7.97,1.72,17.46,3.45,8.19,7.76,0.65,0.43,0.86,0.65,0,0.65,0.65,0,0,0.22,0.43,0,10.78,5.17,2.59,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,1.51,0.86,0.22
fkyn45,not sure what to do,"This happened 3 weeks ago. Sorry it's long .

My (26f) boyfriend (33m) and I were out at a local bar while my friend was visiting me. His ex/fling happened to be there, and he told me he was uncomfortable and I was drunk and made a comment about how someone I also slept with was there, hoping that my discomfort would make him feel better? I dont know. 

Well we all went home and I was on the way to bed when he called me screaming at me how it was so shitty of me to say that, how dare I, I'm such a whore, blah blah. He thought I was trying to go out of my way to hurt him. I went over to his place to try and sort things out but when I got there he was screaming nonstop at me telling me we were over. He shoved me to the ground and stomped on my shoulder. I dont know why I tried to stay and work it out because it only escalated from there. The night lead to punching me multiple times, giving me a black eye, punching my head hard enough that I saw stars and then strangled me. During the strangulation I was able to reach up and dig into his Adam's apple and eyes to get him to stop. How dare I hurt him like that, he felt so betrayed, etc. He had the audacity to call it a ""physical altercation""as though he hadn't tried to kill me.

 I had to lie to myself, my friends and my family after that. I said I slipped out of the shower. I made it a joke. I feel ...so dumb and weak and defeated. This is the only time it's happened. He apologized. He said it wont happen again. I tried breaking up with him today and ended up being roped back into it because I really do love him and I'm so upset that this happened. He's expressed he is upset too. I cant properly get over it. I've told my best friend so that it is more real to me now, knowing someone is aware of what happened,but it is so hard. Hes gone to therapy, hes actively trying to be better but I feel like I'm just fooling myself. 

I thought I'd come here to see if anyone had experienced just one isolated incident and then have it never happen again, but that's fairytale talk. I know the rates about strangulation. I know it is very dangerous for me. Idk where else to turn to. I tried DVhotline but I feel like I just need someone else to do the breakup for me.

fkzeb6,Is it common for dv hotlines to call police?,"Dv hotlines has become a big support for me either. I usually call 1800 respect and they're really helpful. Last time I called them they called the police. They've never done this before. I haven't called again yet due to this. I prefer that hotline in particular though because the counsellors are good.  They told me at one point they don't call police unless they hear me being seriously attacked. After they contacted police I received a text telling me police are trying to locate me to check if I'm safe due to what I told the hotline. Abuser saw this. I thought the text was not a good idea.  The police never came as I didn't give them my location. I understand that they were concerned enough but I'm not sure what to do about that. The phone did cut out during my call either on my end or the counsellors end so maybe that added to it, but it's not the first time the phones cut out. I told them he didn't have weapons.

fl1z6c,Explosive Brother,"My family's been going through a lot of issues regarding my brother as he's grown up and the situation is escalating to a point that I'm worried something awful is going to happen. I've tried to stay out of it but I feel like something has to be done; I just don't know what that something is and I was hoping someone could give me some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to keep this brief; my brother is 16 (I'm 21) and my parents are getting on in their years. They're both past 55 and their advanced age makes it hard to handle my brother. I love my parents dearly, but they never really disciplined my brother and he's been diagnosed with ADHD. I'm gonna try and explain this without ranting/complaining but I feel like the context is important to the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

He is incapable of taking care of himself, he eats only junk food (once a day and that one time is always late at night) and never takes swallows the medicine my parents give him. He's constantly filthy and he usually refuses to take a shower for at least a week. Despite his diet, he's still a growing boy and he's much taller than everyone in the house. He got the hunter genes from my dad and I got the ""never leave the house"" lifestyle from my mom. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only interactions he has with my parents are indifferent at best and openly aggressive at worst. Any time he doesn't spend in his room is spent either outside the house or tormenting my parents. But he's 16 years old and he's a growing boy; I remember what it was like to be that age and I get that everyone is a prick when they're a teenager.

&amp;#x200B;

But my parents lack of discipline for my brother has resulted in him doing whatever he wants at any given moment and he expects to be given whatever he wants. If he's refused anything, he gets extremely angry and violent at a moment's notice. He attacks my mom at least once a week in a blind rage, and it's usually over a petty argument like her asking him to go to bed at 11 at night (he always stays up late screaming over his Xbox microphone, keeping the rest of the house awake). He doesn't attack my dad because he's still afraid of him, but my dad is so reluctant to punish him that as long as my brother doesn't attack him he won't get involved. This has been the status quo of my house for at least three years now, I've been living at college off and on and I vacation with family in another state, so I try to wash my hands of it and not let it ruin my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even this wouldn't prompt me to ask publicly for advice because I've been used to it happening for so long. However, he's starting getting worse lately and my dad is incredibly weak from having a kidney transplant (literally the worst time for it), so my brother has deteriorated further. I took an unloaded hunting rifle that was supposed to be locked in my dad's gun cabinet out of his room yesterday that he was bragging to his friends about having. Things going missing around the house is just a reality of living with him and we never get them back (I keep a lock on my door 100% of the time), but the lighter and candles have gone missing and sometimes it smells like smoke in our kitchen. The final straw was him arguing with my mom about not eating all of the cookies she just made before anyone else could get any, resulting in him smashing everything in his room and threatening her with a rusty axe that he apparently just had lying around. He's never hit anyone so hard that they've had to go to the hospital, but his fits of rage are so violent and he apparently has enough hidden weapons that I'm worried that it's only a matter of time before he either burns the house down or permanently injures my parents (or himself). 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone in my life has told me to try and get out of this house and I never get involved anymore, but is there something I can do about this? I'd appreciate your help.",Madcheeseknight,2020-03-18 19:07:56,1,745,33.33,62.64,31.58,1,27.59,16.78,91.28,59.46,21.34,15.03,7.25,0.27,0.13,6.71,0.67,6.31,5.37,14.36,10.74,5.37,7.25,2.01,20,4.56,3.09,0.67,1.34,1.88,5.23,0.94,4.3,0.67,2.28,0.4,15.3,3.22,0.13,0.81,8.32,11.28,1.07,0.94,1.34,3.76,1.88,3.09,1.48,0.4,0.13,0.81,3.09,0.54,1.61,0,1.07,9.4,3.09,1.07,2.82,2.28,0.94,4.03,12.75,1.34,14.77,2.01,6.71,6.58,0.13,0.67,2.15,0.27,0,0,0.27,0.13,0.13,0,0,0,15.84,3.36,2.01,0,2.01,0.13,0,0,0.27,4.56,1.61,1.88

fl5v66,They think I’m overreacting.,"My husband recently had a mental breakdown and decided to confess all his many secrets to me: He’s a pathological liar; he doesn’t think he’s capable of love; he was sexually abused as a kid and then tried to do it to another kid; he repeatedly beat our dog; he attacked my cat, causing his eye to pop out; he has had sexual feelings towards our children; and he was having thoughts of suicide using one of his guns (he’s a hunter and has many guns). 

And these are just the things I didn’t know about. He’s been emotionally abusive and manipulative for many, many years, especially targeting our only son. But I was dealing with it and picking up the pieces after he made a mess (he’s incapable of remorse). 

He has slapped our son a couple times. He threatened to hit our daughter. He threw something at the wall, creating a hole in the drywall, inches from where two of my girls were sitting in bed. He’s a sex addict, and I knew he wouldn’t be so angry and wouldn’t target the kids as much if I accommodated him, so I made myself have sex with him, but since I “consented,” it was never rape (even though I hated it). So it seems the law can’t do much, since he hasn’t physically abused us yet. And CPS won’t help until AFTER he has sexually abused one of my children.

The day after he confessed everything, I had him leave, and I filed for divorce as soon as I could. First I tried to get an immediate protection order at the advice of a lawyer, but the commissioner rejected it, even with threats of suicide at the top of my list on the paperwork. 

We just had the hearing for temporary custody arrangements yesterday. My husband lied so many times on his paperwork, but nothing was done about it. I got child support but no maintenance, my request that he get a psychological evaluation was not granted, and now he gets unsupervised visitation with my children every other week. The commissioner thought I was exaggerating in my declaration. I literally said everything exactly how he confessed it. 

When all this began, I talked to my bishop at church, who also thought I was overreacting and tried to push marriage counseling on me. My husband is giving everyone at church some sob story, winning over all their sympathy (I don’t go there anymore). They are all under his manipulation. 

My children and I are so much happier without him here. We finally feel peace. And even my daughter’s teacher at school was seeing a noticeable change in her for the better. We’re doing so much better, but the law isn’t helping me. It still seems like he’s winning. 

He will absolutely manipulate my kids during these visits, trying to convince them of how great a father he is. They’ve never known anything else. They don’t know what a good father looks like. They don’t realize that it isn’t okay for a father to completely ignore them unless he decides to feel powerful over them and rage at them. 

We are possessions to this sociopath, and it will be a huge fight to get him to let go of us. And it doesn’t seem that the law will help us much. The court is so worried about a man not getting to see his kids that it refuses to entertain the thought that maybe in this case my children are so much better without him in their lives.",ItNeverRainEveryDay,2020-03-19 00:17:23,27,601,24.49,77.8,27.83,16.28,18.21,18.8,94.01,60.73,22.46,16.81,6.32,2,0,6.66,1.83,5.66,5.82,13.14,10.15,5.99,7.49,3.49,19.13,2.83,2.5,1,0.67,3.33,5.99,2.66,3.33,0.5,2.33,0.5,18.8,2,0.17,0.67,7.99,13.81,4.16,2.33,0.67,1.66,2.5,3.33,1.5,0.67,0.33,0.5,2,0.17,0.67,1,0,12.48,3.66,2.66,5.99,2.16,0.5,5.66,9.98,1,10.98,1.16,4.83,4.83,1.66,0.17,0.17,0,1,0.33,0.33,0,0,0.33,0,0,16.14,5.49,3.83,0.17,1,0,0,0,0.33,3.99,1.33,0
fl61ve,I need advice. Please.,"Details, bare with me:
I live with my Girlfriend and I moved away from family so she could be with hers in the end.
Everything was great at first, until she got to drinking. The first while it was fun drunk. Then one morning I woke up to her drinking and in the end I had to physically block the car with my body to stop her from driving off drunk that morning for more beer and that was our first real verbal fight.
The domestic is coming up just hold.
Not long after she was drinking and pretty sad talking about suicidal stuff. So she agreed to come to work with me. On the way she tried to jump out of the car 3 times. The third I almost lost control of the vehicle trying to keep her from going out.

Tonight was the final straw, and where it becomes domestic... she woke me up acting cute while extremely intoxicated but also telling me she was worried about her grandmother. I knew something was up so while she was hugging me I swiped her car keys from her coat. She left the room a minute so I grabbed mine and hid both.
She came back in aggrivated and I tried to play off being sleepy. She confronted me and I told her to just get sleep and we can go be with her grandmother in the morning. Her answer, she grabbed my glock 23 .40 cal.
I'm trained with firearms and had it in my armoire with a cover. She started to pull it out, I remained calm talking, but grabbed the slide with my forefingers to hold it back with my grip on the handle so it couldn't fire. I tried to simply pull it away but she started fighting. I had no choice but to knee her leg so she would lose grounding and she lost the gun. I removed the mag and cleared the chamber. All firearms were moved to my trunk. She claims she was going to walk to her grandmother's and keep her safe.

Where I need help; I love this woman with all my heart and want to salvage this relationship if I can.
Any advice. Please.

flaffv,Do I forgive my boyfriend for hitting me just once?,"I’ve been with jake (fake name) for about 3 years. We rent a house together and there’s still nearly 11 months before our lease runs out. 

Never had any kind of serious problems in our whole relationship. I mean we do argue occasionally but he’s never tried to physically hurt me before or anything 

This is what happened .. 

I was in the bedroom just on my phone and he was out in the living room. I think he may have been on the game idk but I could hear him getting frustrated at the tv for not working properly or something and then I hear him start walking to our bedroom. No big deal he wasebt yelling or anything. But when he came in the room, out of nowhere he just slammed our door shut behind him. It made the whole wall shake and it made me jump a bit because I dident think he was that angry about the tv. I said “don’t slam the door” because I don’t want to get a noise complaint or anything or have him break the door as we are only renters. I was not trying to be rude or anything like I was just saying. 

He got so angry that I said this. He started yelling that he never tells me what to do so I shouldn’t try to tell him what to do. I tried to explain that I wasn’t telling him what to do and while I was trying to explain it to him he managed to grab me off the bed and kind of shoved me into the door corner. I put my arms infront of me to stop him from getting close to me and idk if you’d call it a hit or a slap but he hit me on the cheek with like his fist ... it wasent a punch but it was with his fist but it dident really hurt that much but it did freak me out cause it made me start tearing up. Not because I was in pain or anything but just idk I was just freaking out and started crying.? 

He dident do anything else. He did swear but I think he was swearing at himself. (He doesn’t usually swear) and he held my face and hugged me after for a pretty long time. He apologised to me a little while afterward and I said it was ok. He said it wasent ok and that he wouldn’t ever do anything like it again. 

I do believe him I think I’m just a bit spooked so I’m having a hard time relaxing around him. 

It all happened within like 30 seconds I’m not sure how it escalated so quickly. Think I might be slightly overreacting by even posting this here. I’m not injured it barely even hurt even though I did start crying. He’s promised not to do it again and I have no reason to not believe him as he has been very nice to me since it happened. 

Is it ok if I forgive him ? I know the saying like if he hits you once he’ll do it again. But I feel my situation might be different. I’m sure I’d leave if he ever did it again. But I don’t think he’s gonna do it again 

Any advice or anything ?

He lives a little while out of town his mum &amp; dad own lots of property. Anyway we were in his room it was just him and I at the house. He was being annoying and trying to convince me to do some things I wasn’t comfortable with so I kept saying no. He wouldn’t stop asking so I said I wanted to go home. He then said that he wouldn’t drive me home until I atleast tried to do what he wanted to ‘see if I liked it’ ( he was asking me to blow him) 

This made me panic because we were the only ones here and it was too far to walk back into town so my only way back was for him to drive me. Or I wait for his mum to come home and ask her to take me back but I had no idea what time she’d be home and he wouldn’t tell me. 

I went and sat in his lounge room while he stayed in his room. I thought he’d eventually stop being an asshole and take me home. 

He came out to where I was and he handed me a Condom and made me put it on him he kept grabbing me when I tried to sit up 

I refused to do anything else I just kind of sat there until he moved. 

I TOLD him then I dident want to do anything at all and that I wanted him to drive me home right now or I’d call someone and tell them what he was doing. 

He pulled my hair really hard my neck flicked back and while he was yelling in my ear he’d ripped my phone out Of my hand 

I was able to immediately snatch it back from him but that made him angry and he ended up hitting me in my face. 

I dident say anything after hed hit me and he then let me get into his car and he drove me home. 

He mumbled a sorry when I got out of his car

I haven’t talked to him since. I think I’m too scared honestly I get nervous Just thinking about what happened. 

I haven’t told anyone about what happened I feel gross that he made me put a condom on him.

flhk54,Have there been any instants of abuse cases similar to the hypothetical scenario detailed in this post?,"In this hypothetical scenario, there is a father and son pair. The boy's mother/father's wife had abandoned the family for another man. To make matters worse, the father is going through jobs like socks, and is knee deep in debts.

In response to his failings in life, the father has turned to alcohol. Unfortunately, the descent into alcoholism has exacerbated his already violent tendencies. As a result, the father frequently beats his son in his drunken rages, often breaking bones. On some occasions, the attacks escalate to full fledged sexual assaults.

Several decades later, the tables have turned. The father has become an elderly man under the care of his now adult son. The son leaves his father locked in a rat infested cellar 24.7, and steals money from him for drugs. He only tosses his father a slice of bread or pizza two or three times a day.

fll0is,Going thru Divorce; Grey Rock not doing anything!,"Hey all. Just need advice. Short and sweet married 16yrs to a physically, emotionally, financially abusive man. Probably a narcissist and possibly other personality disorders in the mix too. I left with our kids last June. Went to a DV shelter, filed for divorce. Have a great, well respected divorce lawyer. My family uber supportive once they learned the extent of the violence and abuse I was dealing with daily. Typical look perfect on outside, inside was hell. 
I found an apt, I work... I think after 16yrs I’m doing well at rebuilding my life, learning how to be my own person, happy with myself. Etc etc. it’s so wonderful not crying myself to sleep, hiding bruises at work, need I go on.

Anyway my stbx husband REFUSES to play by the rules. We communicate via OurFamilyWizard and 98% of the messages are bullshit related to our divorce, how horrible I am and basically making me out to be a money hungry waste of life while he’s a martyr. The other 2% are about the kids and of that most are guilt tripping. We are supposed to hand off the kids at the police station... he usually refuses, has a temper tantrum, name calls via OFW until I capitulate and then once we meet up he corners me to bullshit about I better sign papers or we better get back together or some other bullshit so I’m stuck standing there trying to remain calm, not answer back,  not incite him while he rambles in and on and on and on. If I try to walk away or tell him NO it’s OVER the. He screams obscenities at me. I front of the kids. I front of anyone around. He does NOT care!

So my issue is other than he thinks I’m a cow he owns... my doing Grey Rock literally is doing NOTHING! I actually think he thinks the more harassing cajoling, bullying he engages in thT I’ll just give up, get tired of it, resign to a life of beaten down misery and come home. 

What else can I try? Grey rock doesn’t do anything. Cease and desists from my lawyer don’t do anything..., nothing! Telling him no it’s OVER does nothing. If we weren’t married then this shit would be stalking but since we are married and going thru a divorce I have to put up with it. I’m sooooooo tired! It takes every fiber of my being to keep my composure. Oh and we have to be in contact for the kids...",bluepisces1980,2020-03-19 17:16:26,10,433,51.13,45.4,66.5,25.77,12.37,16.63,89.61,57.74,17.09,13.16,7.85,2.08,0,3,0.23,3.93,5.54,15.47,9.47,5.08,6.93,3,17.32,5.08,1.39,0.69,0.92,1.15,6.93,3.46,3.46,0.69,1.85,0.69,13.16,2.31,0.23,0,3.46,12.47,2.08,0.92,1.15,4.16,1.39,4.39,1.62,0.92,0.23,0.23,2.54,0.69,1.39,0,0.46,10.62,4.16,1.85,3.23,1.62,0.46,2.08,12.47,1.15,13.39,1.85,8.31,3.7,2.08,1.15,0.46,0.46,0.23,0,3,1.15,0.23,0,0.69,0.23,18.48,9.24,4.39,0,0.23,0.23,1.15,0,0,2.77,0,0.46
fllizx,Here's why I've been gone for 3 months: he left!!!,"So I've been handling a lot - I had to carefully wait for him to ask for a divorce. I figured that would be the best move as he looks for any opportunity to retaliate. 

He still looks for those opportunities, and I still dodge them as much as possible, and we are in the midst of divorce right now. 6 months to go. We are about to finish up mediation and solve the financial decisions of the split, and then it's just waiting for the court to review the resolution and approve it. 

I've been on here, sharing what I learned, enthusiastically recommending Lundy Bancroft books, and another book that really helped me was: Gaslighting: Recognize Manipulative and Emotionally Abusive People - and Break Free.  I randomly found this at the library and it was really helpful. The biggest thing I learned was that if an abusive person wants out of the relationship, Don't Stop Them! Let them go. If you convince them to stay, you will become more in danger. Although my husband was not physically abusive, his verbal abuse, disdain, and disrespect was getting worse and worse. 

So when he said he wanted a divorce, I saw the shock on his face when I said, ""Ok, how soon can you move out?"" 9 days later, he was gone. 

I have just barely been able to take care of the house and work. I go to a DV support group and see a therapist who specializes in domestic violence. 

Thanks to all of you for the support and for the opportunity to support you, as well. I'm still here, just had to get to an ok place to be back on reddit.

flmk9u,"My sister(18F) physically and emotionally abuses me (16F), and our mother won't do anything about it","Hello, I'm looking for some advice on my situation. I have an older sister who has had a history of hitting me, which has only become more frequent in recent years. She punches and slaps me, sometimes using objects such as wooden boards; she also pulls my hair and kicks me. She has sometimes threatened me with knives. Whenever I cry, she mocks me, and she often laughs or smiles when inflicting pain to me. Never once has she apologized.

My sister also emotionally abuses and regularly insults me. Aside from the regular remarks like ""idiot"", ""retard"", ""loser"", etc., she also tells me that I should go kill myself and/or that I should have already killed myself. Although, she is aware that I am depressed and have recently been suicidal, she still pokes fun at my ""mental instability"". Otherwise, she never listens to me or says/does anything polite or nice, and regularly tells me that she hates me.

I've given up on telling these things to my mom. In the past, she would respond by either making us apologize to each other, or giving my sister a light lecture (which has never caused my sister to change any of her behavior). 

I do not have any trusted adults in my life (we do not have contact with relatives outside our immediate family, and my counseling department at school is quite frankly not very useful- I've tried talking to them but haven't received any helpful advice). I told a friend about this, and they've told me to fight back against my sister. I do not believe that is the answer, however I have several times slapped her back in self defense. All our conflicts end in me either giving up or crying; she never appears to show remorse. 

We are in the same academic year (since she has gotten held back), so we will be going to college soon and I can only hope that one of us moves out so that I do not have to live with her. We go to different schools, and I have an after school job, so I do not see her often on most days, but since everything is shut down due to the coronavirus, I am stuck at home with her. She has been hitting me nearly everyday for the past week, and I am beginning to experience suicidal thoughts again.

Any help would be appreciated.

flnl4m,I don’t feel like life is real anymore and I don’t know how to fix this feeling.,"I’ll try to keep it shortish since it is a long-winded story.

Basically, my (20F) brother (29) and his fiancé (29) moved down with their son (1) into my mom’s house about a month ago. We were super excited because that was the first time we got to meet their son and the whole family was reunited after living states apart for years.
As soon as they moved in, I began realizing how abusive my brother was toward his fiancé. I’m talking mentally, emotionally, verbally, physically, and financially. He always did something to her when nobody else was around, so I personally never caught him doing any of the physical stuff but I saw the damage it left to my mom’s property and I witnessed the emotional/mental/verbal/financial abuse. I never knew my brother was like this. As a child, I knew he had a temper, but I couldn’t have imagined it was like this.

Basically — yesterday, my mom and I were hanging out with Fiancé in the living room. She had been drinking because her husband-to-be is a piece of shit, and I honestly don’t blame her. But she’s epileptic, and prone to seizures when she’s stressed, especially while drunk. My two brothers came home and the one she thought she wanted to marry was MAD she had been drinking. They started bickering and that’s when her first seizure started.

It was my first time seeing a seizure in person and I was floored. She has a second seizure within 3 minutes so my brother (her fiancé) calls 911. She gets scared and yells at him not to call. She gets up from the couch and moved towards him to get the phone from his hand. (She’s not running, keep in mind. In no way did she present as aggressive or a threat.)

He body checks her five feet across the living room. Her head, with all of her 150 pounds on top of it, SMACKS onto a marble end table and she falls to the floor like a dead weight, completely unresponsive. I thought he just killed her. 
An ambulance comes right as she has a third seizure. I drive brother to the hospital, and he gets arrested on the spot for battery (though he was just released today, after a short overnight stay in jail). I stay in the ER from 12a-530a to be with Fiancé. I was questioned by police for the first time ever and filled out a report for the first time ever, I watched my brother get patted down and handcuffed.

Fiancé is fine, no lasting injuries, and at this point in time, she’s saying she’s going to press charges.

This is where I need help. It feels like... I don’t know, like I can’t properly process the past day and a half? Like, nothing feels real right now and I kinda feel like I’m not in the “front seat” of my existence, if that makes sense? I can’t get the sound of her head cracking against that end table out of my head. It plays on a loop, accompanied by my mom yelling and my brothers talking over everyone. Maybe this isn’t where I need to be posting this, as I’M not
the one who went flying across a room, but... I just don’t know what I need to do to feel normal again? I don’t know what this drudge-y feeling is or what to do with it.

I do apologize if I’ve perhaps chosen the wrong place to post this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",misskianab,2020-03-19 20:06:59,4,618,43.32,44.86,65.94,7.24,15.85,14.4,90.29,57.93,19.42,14.4,7.44,0.32,0,5.99,0.65,5.02,6.15,14.24,9.06,4.53,7.44,3.24,18.61,3.24,2.75,1.78,2.91,0.81,3.56,0.97,2.59,0.49,1.78,0,12.3,2.75,0,4.69,3.72,10.84,3.24,0.97,1.13,1.94,1.62,3.07,3.07,0.49,0.81,1.62,3.88,1.29,2.1,0,0.65,6.8,2.75,1.29,1.62,1.29,0.32,6.47,10.52,0.49,16.83,2.27,8.09,6.63,0.65,1.13,1.13,0.32,0,0.32,0.49,0.16,0.16,0,0.16,0,19.26,6.47,4.69,0,0,0.49,0,0.81,0.32,3.72,2.27,0.49
flsyft,I'm so stupid for going back.,"Abuser had an outburst at me in the grocery store tonight because he wanted me to buy a certain cat food but I wanted to stick to the brand I wanted, as it's my cat and my money. It was over such a small thing. I try so hard but nothing will ever stop him from being angry or abusive. I should have just stayed in the new house I was in even with the sexual harassment from the male housemate that was going on. It was nowhere near as bad as my bfs physical and mental abuse. I at least had one friend there and I miss him so much but he won't have anything to do with me now that I'm back with abuser. Abuser came into that house yelling. I'm just so stupid for returning and leaving the new house I was at. I already messaged the landlady at the new house asking if that room is still empty. She probably doesn't want me back there. I honestly feel like I'm never going to get away from him. This post is probably all jumbled. I litterely have absolutely nobody. I have no family and no friends. I have my cat at least.  The house mates here laugh at me with abuser and say I'm crazy due to hormones. There is 4 guys here and none of them have once protected me from him. They enable his behaviour. At the new house they at least didn't tolerate him and knew that he was an abuser and they would go for him when he yelled in the house.

fm2ovg,Just want him to come home and get it over and done with,"Im just waiting for my husband to come home and hit me and or destroy everything

We haven’t spoken in about a week. He said something to me today , we got in an argument and I asked him to leave. 

I packed his stuff he came back and broke my closet and  everything fell.  He gets really violent! 
I told him to just please leave! He text me that it’s war when he gets home . He tried  to break something in my car, but instead disconnected the battery. I’ve gotten to the hate part, but it’s been like that for a bit. 

Honestly, I’m just waiting for him to get here and do whatever he wants to me or the house. Get it over and done with! Yes, I packed his shit and put the mattress he just bought in the living room. I also threw my clothes from the drawer out. Bc his done it before so he’ll do it again. It’s like what’s left,? Just go! 

Take it, take it all. Yes, we’re married, but he’s predictable. He will take everything he bought. But I’m fine bc it all materialistic, I want my peace and sanity! Fuck a TV a mattress etc I want to work on me, I want to fix  me. 

Before you judge , bc I see that a lot of that here. Know that  I know I shouldn’t react. But I’m so tired, it’s like I want to fight back. I want him to feel what I feel! Why is it ok for him to have this power over me. He can hit me , break and throw  my stuff and belittle me!?

I was there when he was going downhill! He doesn’t see it, but staying up everyday getting high . Definitely  is a problem. When we’ve separated he would call me bc he lost his job and felt lonely. I would drop what I was doing bc he said he was depressed. Well I’ve been depressed for years and I get “you need help” “get over that’s life”

fm6y7k,20 years later...,"Hi I'm not really sure where to post this but I'll try here.

So when I was much younger, (27F now) I was a witness to domestic abuse towards my beloved mother by her ex partner. It has taken me over 20 years to confront this and only this year I spoke about any of it with her. There were things I've always thought I saw happen that I'd repressed and wasn't sure if they truly did, or whether my mind was making them up, which are extremely difficult to think about that she confirmed did happen. Everything I saw haunts me to this day. To the point I still get flashbacks etc. 

Throughout the years I've always been really sensitive to loud noises or people shouting when arguing etc and I can't watch or talk about anything violent through fear of bringing the memories back. 

Today (this evening) I was woken up by loud screaming from a female outside, instantly my heart began beating out of my chest and I ran to the window to see what was happening. I woke my partner up and tried to remain calm as I didn't want to make it seem about me when it really wasn't, he put his clothes on and went outside to see what was going on but by the time he was out there no one was around. We didn't get a car plate or any description of the people or anything so there's not so much we can do, but that's a different issue. (However we've heard this type of stuff before, most likely a drunken teenage daughter by the sounds of what was said)

My issue is I'm sat here in bed at 1:14 a few hours after it happened and I'm still in panic mode. This happens everytime I hear anything remotely like angry shouting and I want to know what i can do to not feel this way anymore. Its taken this long to confront it and I still struggle to talk about it with people as I am really bad at explaining how I feel about things etc and I've never been one to talk about anything negative when it comes to my childhood etc as I am extremely grateful that I still have my incredible mum around despite the fact I almost witnessed her murder 2 times.  Even writing those words is something I've never done and is extremely painful to me but I really need to help myself and I figured confronting it head on is a start..

I just need to know where to go from here to finally deal with these feelings I've kept hidden for over 2 decades. Any advice from anyone who's been on a similar situation would be amazing..

PS) Sorry for the long read, not only do I mumble I'm also really bad at writing in GENERAL!",RosieLilyValentine,2020-03-20 18:29:55,0,486,21.28,16.16,95.31,3.76,27,14.81,94.03,62.96,20.99,12.35,9.88,0.62,0,1.44,0.41,8.64,3.5,16.26,10.29,10.49,7.41,2.67,20.16,4.73,2.26,2.88,1.65,1.44,5.14,1.44,3.7,0.82,1.65,0.21,8.02,0.62,0.62,1.65,0.62,15.23,2.26,0.62,1.23,4.12,2.67,5.97,4.32,1.23,2.26,0.82,1.23,0.82,0.21,0,0.21,4.94,1.44,0.41,1.85,0.82,0.62,7.61,11.73,0.41,15.64,1.65,6.17,7.82,0.62,0.21,0.62,0,0,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,11.93,4.32,1.65,0.21,0,0,0.21,0,0,4.12,1.44,0

she texted me the next morning saying something had happened. that her room was in shambles and she felt bruised like she had been beaten. i was gone for the week and the next few days she stayed in bed to recover, telling me her neck and back were hurting more than before and it felt like she had a bruise on her head. 

apparently no one knows anything. she was drinking so she has no memory of it. my brother wasnt home during the time i think it happened. and my dad wont say anything and i wont bring it up to him cause i think i will say or something or do something ill regret.  

he’s strangled her before, once in front of me, but to my knowledge has never straight up beat her. i wouldnt put it past him though. he had the opportunity to do it in a way that no one could verify it was him or not.

fmbg0h,Bf of almost 2 years choked/hit me for the first time today. Need support and encouragement to leave,"We’ve been together almost 2 years. Things have been rocky between me (23F) and him (24M) for almost a year now. The rockiness started after I discovered a betrayal from him. Nothing as bad as physically cheating, but I found out that he had been lying to me and deceiving me about important parts of his past, things he’s done, and he trickle-truthed me about what really went down for months.

He has a temper. His friends and family and I all know this about him and it’s a well-known fact that he gets mad really easily and has a hard time controlling himself when he does, usually he’ll start cursing, yelling, calling people names, ball up his fists, throw things (not at people), punch things (not people), and when he’s really angry he’ll sometimes start punching himself. We’ve gotten into some really bad fights over the past year and he’s done all of those things at some point, but he’s never laid a hand on me.

Important to note, when I first discovered his betrayal, I did something terrible. I was so hurt and I felt so betrayed that I punched him in the arm multiple times. He told me to do it. He said that he deserved to be hurt for the way he hurt me. And I punched him probably like 10 times or so. I am incredibly ashamed that I did that, and I have never laid a hand on him ever again since that happened a year ago. 

Fast forward to today, we were at my house and we got in a huge fight. He broke up with me. I kept begging him to stay and talk but he kept telling me to get out of his way so he could leave. I wouldn’t let him leave so he grabbed my neck with his hand (like choking me) firmly but not very hard. It didn’t hurt but I was so stunned that he was able to get past me and leave. He left and drove back to his house but I followed him to his house and his parents let me in. I wanted to talk and apologize for the things that I’d said during the fight but he kept telling me to leave. I stood in the doorway and blocked him from leaving. I know it was wrong of me not to leave when he kept telling me to leave over and over again. This went on for maybe about an hour, me pleading with him to please talk and him telling me to leave. Eventually, he grabbed me by the jacket and pulled me away from the door and said that I had to leave. I still wouldn’t leave (again, I know that’s my fault for not respecting his wishes). Then he started punching me hard in the arm. He punched me maybe about 5 times or so. His parents heard something was happening and came in and they immediately started taking care of me. He took off out the door and left. I now have a bruise about the size of a tennis ball on my arm below my shoulder. 

I know the relationship is over. I know we’re not good for each other and we can never be. I know that you’re supposed to leave the first time your partner hits you. But I can’t help but feeling that this is my fault, because I did hit him when I discovered his betrayal, and because I provoked him by not letting him leave when he kept asking me to. And as bad as all of this sounds, we were really so good together when he wasn’t angry. I saw a future with him. I wanted to marry him and have a family with him. He made me so happy. All the silly inside jokes and pet names and the way his eyes would twinkle when he smiled and the way he would nuzzle me and the way he smells. I won’t ever find those things again with another person. Maybe I’ll find someone who makes me happy too, but it won’t ever be the same as the way he made me feel. We won’t have the same inside jokes or pet names and he won’t smell the same or nuzzle me the same and his eyes won’t twinkle the same. I miss him so much and I don’t think I have the strength to leave for good. If he ever came back and begged for me to take him back, I think I would, because I love him so much and I miss him so much and things were so good when they weren’t bad. 

Logically, I know that we can’t ever be together again. But I’m having a really hard time coming to terms with this. I know that this is how people get trapped in abusive relationships, because they stay for all the good parts and ignore all the bad. I don’t think I’m strong enough to get over this and give up on him on my own. I still keep thinking that this was just a hiccup and we can get better and things can be good again. I think I’m in denial. Please, help support me and encourage me to get over him and leave.",ollsray,2020-03-21 00:41:24,13,908,12.74,51.76,63.87,20.74,17.13,10.57,95.48,64.1,24.89,19.71,9.8,1.1,0.33,8.15,0.33,5.18,4.85,12.22,8.15,7.6,10.57,2.75,20.48,2.75,1.54,1.32,0.77,1.54,6.61,3.08,3.41,0.11,1.21,0.77,15.42,0.55,0.33,0,8.48,12.33,2.53,1.32,1.21,2.2,1.87,3.85,2.97,0.33,0.66,1.76,1.65,1.1,0.44,0,0,9.25,3.08,0.66,2.86,2.09,0.88,7.27,10.57,1.43,16.3,3.08,6.39,7.71,0,0.77,1.1,0.11,0,0,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,0,13.77,5.73,2.97,0,0,0,0,0.22,0,3.41,1.32,0.11

fmw53w,"Finally left husband, but he won’t leave me alone.","My husband and I got married last year. I was 16, and he was 20. We have a 6 month old daughter together. He started becoming aggressive when we found out I was pregnant. He strangled me until I was unconscious. But I was a high school student without a job and didn’t feel like I could leave him because I wouldn’t have any money for my daughter. 

We got married, and I moved to his duty station across the country from my family. I found out he had been seeing prostitutes and talking to girls on dating apps WHILE i was pregnant. He claims the only time he had sex with a prostitute is when I was 36 weeks pregnant, in the hospital being induced with HELLP syndrome. The abuse started verbally, but quickly escalated to physical intimidation, then pushing, then throwing “fake punches” (purposely missing me), then to real punches but never my face, and finally this last week, he drove me to the middle of nowhere without my phone and beat me until I was bruised all over and had cuts on my face.

When we got home, he gave me my phone and I told him I was going to check the mail. I called the police, who came and watched him as I grabbed as much stuff as I could fit into my two suitcases. I grabbed it all, took my daughter, and didn’t look bad. I got to the airport to find out he had called TSA at our airport and told them I had tested positive for COVID-19 and that I shouldn’t be allowed on the plane. The police came and gave me their numbers so I could call if needed. I was allowed to fly home as I had actually been tested and was negative. 

Now, he is texting me on any platform he can reach me and telling me he is going to fly to where I live and kill me + my family. And then disappear before he gets caught.

fmwmwy,Abusive Bf (28M) of two years self confessed to cheating out of spite,"I am 25F, and my boyfriend of two years has been abusive for the last year. At first a slap which broke him up for days and days on end. He truly regretted it, and was upset saying I did not deserve a hand laid on me like that and he was sorry. Well, it progressively grew from that. As the abuse got more intense and violent, his regret just started to disappear. It would show after when he returned to earth, and would show in anger at himself and pure distraught at himself. Not so much for me, which he was always sorry for after, but he hated himself for turning out like this. 

We are two very explosive people, with pasts neither of us are proud of. The difference was that he was super open about it, and I wasn’t. I lied and lied, and trickle truthed about things. There was truth in lies and lies in truth. In the end everything came out - absolutely everything. 

Even when we were seeing each other at first we were wrong. He was trying to break it off with his ex girlfriend (which I understand relationships can overlap when you meet someone special to you), and at one stage had fully gotten back with her, I seen this on social media, and I for the first time hooked up with someone from Tinder, and I felt disgusting about it. It was all to spite him and not care but it didn’t work, I just felt small and pathetic and that it solidified how much I cared. 

But I had made a drunken mistake of sleeping with someone. Yes I had made the choice but I did it and I woke up thinking ‘fuck this isn’t what I want to be, and i don’t want to do this to him - he’s worth so much more!’

Basically I had messed up at the beginning because of how messy it had been for him to have a gf and go back and forth between me and her, and I reacted in a way I didn’t want to. I didn’t actually want to hurt him just because he hurt me, but that was too late. And I made a mistake, and I felt wrong. 

But back to the title of this post. His friend was over in his home tonight and they were having drinks, catching up, etc. Me and him were texting the whole time - as we have both been doing only the right thing for each other the last 2 months. No abuse, no nothing. We have been good, apart from a few normal and healthy relationship arguments. 

He starts to hurl abuse at me though over text while I’m asleep. I wake up and foolishly bite in, when I should ignore it and sleep. He is drunk and he doesn’t mean it 99% of the time. But I do bite, and he sends me screenshots of girls he is sexting while he was texting me how much he loves me and misses me and in that night before the shit, I was like wow I really do love this man, and he needed to be shown openness and love from me because I hurt him. He isn’t that horrible abuser. 

Worse. He is an abuser and a cheater. He has slept with 11 other women just in the last year. He has been texting women while I’m with him and while I’m not. Scornfully he told me “you should have been the one looking at my phone, at my texts. You should have looked at my deleted media, you have seen I was recording having sex with all of these girls.”

I am shocked beyond belief. This happened at about 1:30am and it is now 8:25am. I haven’t cried and I haven’t slept. I feel sick, and I just want death to take me right now. 

Despite the two of us being volatile and hot headed, we have both been taking huge steps to not be that to each other. And it has been working brilliantly. But now that nice relationship that we both so much wanted, or I thought both of us, has ended in him sexting and banging other women.",PerfectTrade2,2020-03-22 01:27:11,2,725,17.69,48.34,45.2,1,16.48,10.9,94.9,64.55,22.07,15.31,7.59,1.38,0.69,5.52,0.14,6.76,3.45,14.07,11.31,5.38,10.07,2.62,19.72,4.69,1.79,1.52,1.93,2.48,8.97,2.62,6.34,0.41,2.9,1.52,12.69,0,0.69,1.1,5.66,12,1.52,1.38,2.21,0.69,1.66,4.69,2.62,1.1,0.28,1.24,2.62,1.1,0.14,0.55,0.41,7.86,3.86,1.38,1.52,0.69,0.41,9.1,8.55,0.14,14.21,0.83,7.45,6.07,0.28,0.55,0.14,0.14,0.28,0.14,1.1,0.28,0.28,0.28,0.14,0,14.34,5.79,4.55,0.28,0,0,0.14,0.41,0.41,2.07,0.55,0.14

fmwvm7,Things have gotten WORSE - I'm in split minds though.,"Well this is an update from my previous posts: things have gotten worse, like I mean WAY worse.

She's resorted to making rather snide remarks, which I feel she knows annoys the crap out of me, hence why she does it. She constantly watches me whilst I eat and makes like these little clicks with her mouth shaking her head etc .. really bloody annoying! Her M.O I believe, is to try and incite a fight by saying some stuff which annoys the crap out of me looking for a fight. And when she gets a response she's constantly at me and at me ... it's like please .... SHUT THE HECK UP!!!

To that end I have considered typing her an email, explaining exactly what I think, how I feel, in the fact that I feel she's only doing this because of my adoption all those years ago, she wanted to continue the abuse that was done all those years ago. The fact that she has promised to give me some money to put on my credit card, but has failed to do so. The same person that expects me to help pay some of her bills, because I live with her, and she continually speak to/treat me like I am worth nothing to her .. which is exactly how I feel. My simple equation for her is this: treat me like nothing, speak to me like I mean nothing to you, and you get nothing done by me, you get no bills paid by me because of the fact it's feeding her ego .. she can do it and get things done/stuff paid by me .. NOT happening!

So what's your advice guys? Write the email? Or just try and find a way of getting out, then send it to her..

fn0au7,A little help please,"Hi , my name is Rup and I....am scared. 

I don't exactly have the best parents . Being stabbed two times, gotten regular beaten up by a broken alcohol bottle , got my head smashed into marble , thrown off into marble stairs and getting kicked with the knee in my stomach and rib cage is almost a daily occurance my whole life.

Did I mention I am 16? 

I have been pretty much been in hell my whole life . 
Getting my hands dunked into super hot batter if I even tried to cook cause ""boys don't cook"" , and slapped on my back with a red hot iron spatula cause I didn't complete some task they gave me , has been a common occurrence of my life. 

I have grown ok and accustomed to amounts violence , fuckery , blood and tourture even military officers would be scared off. 

Now , if you are going to try to help me run away ,or do anything to better my situation , just don't waste your time , I live in India , and my Dad is an high ranking police officer , I have tried to run away or seek betterment of life eversince I was 13 . Shit don't work that way here.  And even if by some miracle I was seperated from my Psychophatic family , I would die before I am admitted to the Indian orgpanage system . It's literally slavery . 67% of all kids admited in it go ""missing""( are sold for 200-500 ruppes ,or 2.5 - 6.4 USDs) , never even getting a case registered for their ""disappearace"" , just , staying part of a statistic some(about 20-40%) Indian families are proud to hear because "" these children must have been abonden by God cause they are a weight on society , atleast someone is making them work"" .

My backstory aside....here is where....Idk..... atleast think there might be still a little scope of help. 

My annual class 11 exam marks are coming out in about a weak.  I am actually quite a good student. Being part of the ""intellectuals"" of the class . I have scored good relatively to the class this time. I am fifth in my class of 26 . 

The Problem is.......... it's good. But just not good ENOUGH.  My parents had warned me of consiquences if I didn't score very high per subject . They frankly can't give a shit if I am fith highest in class, or even if , relatively, I have been improving my grades. They wanted a certain amount of marks . They warned me of consiquences. I couldn't deliver that high. Now....I am afraid. Of the consiquences. 

I am having anxiety and panic attacks every few. Hours . 

The last time they gave such an ultimatum , and I failed to deliver , I got stabbed . These people don't give ultimatums without meaning them . I..... just don't know what I will face now. 

It would a big *BIG* help , if any of you can help deal with my panic and anxiety attacks . That alone would make this post wholly worth it. 

But.....any other kind of help....is appreciated too.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents hate each other, but none of them are willing  to file for divorce nor leave the house. They have heated arguments which include insults and threats every single day over stupid things. My mom can't leave as she doesn't have a job and, on top of everything, my 8 year-old brother had been diagnosed with ADHD and a maturational delay before everything started to get worse between them. He's on meds and ocupational therapy, which doesn't seem to help at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to all of this, my 18 year-old brother is very impulsive and violent. His personality clashes with my dad's most of the time, resulting in them punching each other. After one of this fights, brother had a black eye for a week. He's been fired from two jobs already, and doesn't want to study anything, so he's at home most of the time doing absolutely nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Little brother's situation isn't getting better, in fact, it's only getting worse and his diagnosis isn't very promising. He's also impulsive, violent and very demanding. Not only that, but he's also a very big boy. I'm honestly scared for my mom, she's emotionally weak, fragile and suffers from untreated paranoia.

&amp;#x200B;

Therapy is not an option, they are against it. I've told them many times they had to get therapy, not only for them but for my little brother as well to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the worst things of this whole situation is that they pretend to be the perfect family outside, but even that  facade falls down when they get angry, as they start yelling and don't care whether they are in public or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Today my parents got into an argument once again, but this time my dad got drunk during lunch, which was odd because he hardly ever drinks that much, and insulted my 18 year-old brother in front of my little brother. Mom had to take his bottle of wine away to prevent him from drinking more, to which he got mad and started insulting all of us as well. He couldn't even stand properly. 



Luckily for me, I moved in with my boyfriend recently so I'm not living with them anymore. Perhaps I should've stayed for my mom, if something happens to her I'd feel guilty and I'm not sure I could forgive myself for leaving.

To top it off my boyfriend is back to pushing me and yelling at me. I am “worthless” and a “joke”. I have paid all bills for the last year from my savings. If I didn’t have a son, I would have left him. Now I can’t help but wonder, I am wasting all this money on someone when really it’s mine and my sons to live off of. I have picked up everything and moved to another state to start my life over but never with a son. My baby boy is my world and I want to do right by him. What do I do?  Any suggestions where I can live that has reduced child care, good schools and resources for single mothers. Obviously I have no one. The abuse has gotten way worse. He comes in the room just to pick fights. Even if it was a good day. I get sick to my stomach hearing him come up the stairs. I am lonely. I miss true friendship, truly being in love and as pathetic as this sounds. Touch by someone who loves unconditionally. Living touch not touch meant to hurt you like choking, pushing etc. I want someone who can tell me something about me and who never talks over me.",deedee705,2020-03-22 12:47:19,1,489,18.82,22.47,87.19,25.77,11.64,11.45,95.3,59.3,22.7,17.18,13.5,0,1.02,1.64,1.02,5.52,3.48,12.07,10.02,5.93,5.93,4.29,20.45,4.7,1.64,2.86,2.25,1.84,7.77,3.89,3.89,0.82,1.23,1.64,14.11,1.84,1.23,0.2,3.48,13.7,1.84,1.84,1.64,3.07,2.45,4.91,2.04,0.2,1.02,0.82,3.27,0.41,2.25,0,0,6.95,2.25,0.61,3.07,1.02,0.61,4.09,15.54,0.82,10.84,1.43,6.75,3.07,2.25,0.82,1.23,2.66,0,0.2,0.41,0,0,0.2,0,0,14.72,9.2,2.25,0,0,0.2,0,0.2,0.82,2.04,0,0

My brother has previously assaulted me, although he has been to therapy and other stuff to prevent it from happening in the future. Although recently he was sent to a psychiatric ward for anxiety reasons. He was released from the hospital a few days ago. Since his release, he has been abusing his medication (mostly ativan). I feel nervous and uncomfortable in own home. Earlier today, he took 3 ativan pills when he was only supposed to take one. He is also mixing his medication with alcohol. He has been quite clearly high and really all he does is sit at home. He barely showers and he hasn't brushed his teeth in 3 days. His girlfriend is planning on breaking up with him, which makes this whole situation worse.

fnde32,My brother 19M tried to strangle me to death...,"So today I had a big fight with my brother (again). This time he really tried to kill me, and this is no joke. I feel helpless as he’s lying to everyone about and is forcing his girlfriend to lie for him as she was actually witnessing what he was doing. 

Reason for his madness? We had some connection problems and one of the people working for our provider said that we had to try turning off the booster (which me and my brother did) and after, our WiFi worked perfectly. He wasn’t home at the time. He was staying at his girlfriend. 

Normally he would come back on Monday, but sadly he came back Sunday. He went upstairs to his room and directly started screaming once he noticed the booster wasn’t plugged in anymore. All because the game he was downloading, stopped, but how could we know about that? So it made him really mad and he started screaming to my brother who is 18M (l’m 20M). He said the technician of our provider knew nothing and to put it in his words: “if he asked to suck your dick, would you also do it?”. This just shows how incredibly toxic my brother is as an individual. He already failed secondary twice during his first and last year, so you can imagine what kind of a person he is.

So back to the story; I then heard him screaming and I asked him to calm down, but sadly, it just made him angrier. He now also started screaming against me. In the meanwhile his girlfriend is asking him to calm down (which he blatantly ignores). He goes downstairs and turns of the internet completely. So we go downstairs to turn it back on. So while I’m fixing it, just plugging it in again, he starts a discussion with and there I made the mistake to talk to him. My brother has ADHD also and I knew he would become aggressive for the smallest thing, which sadly happened. 

He was attacking me on something I said a few months ago about his girlfriend as reaction to his insults, but for one reason he can’t see to forget. For the people wondering: I called her a slut and apologized for it,on the other hand my brother had never said sorry for the things he had ever said to me our people I know, who he talks bad about.

Then he said to his girlfriend, that he was going to his room (which was the case). He then proceeded to walk past me, but instead of going to his chamber. He attacked me from behind. To say it as it is; he tried to strangle me. It lasted for almost 20-25s before I was able to throw him over my back almost onto the closet nearby. I actually think this is the only reason I survived before going unconscious.

Now we gonna talk about his girlfriend who was witnessing this all,m. She screamed multiple times he had to stop and she got so scared she ran outside to our garden, and she was about to leave. I understand her panicking because I was too, cuz there was nobody to help me and she just ran away instead of trying to help.

When I got out of his grip, I ran outside too and asked her that she will tell the truth about what happened but then my brother came again. Kicked me once in the back but then I just punched him in the face. 

As I was shocked about what happened outside, he and his girlfriend went back inside but they locked all the doors so I was stuck outside. I heard his girlfriend say that she was scared of him and that he had to calm down, yet she did nothing to help but stay by his side. She showed me that love can make people extremely blind... 

My parents are divorced and we’re living with our father. So he called our mom and her new husband to pick them up. My step-dad said that he will listen to what they have to say and that I had to call. Me thinking his girlfriend would atleast say to my parents that he started strangling me out of nothing, but nope, that didn’t happen at all. They were actually trying to make it less worse then it was by just saying it was a normal ‘brother fight with my brother just holding me’. 

I feel lost people. My brother tried to strangle me, my neck hurts immensely and the only witness who can say how it went is lying to protect him. I’m sure she will have told him that what he did wasn’t ok, but she is now lying for him. 

His abuse gets worse and worse. He used to throw punches, but now he has stepped over to trying to strangle me to death. 

All my friends are forcing me to call social care in my country and try to move away ASAP. I’m still studying and have as good as no money. I feel stuck and I believe that this guy will one day be capable of hitting on the wrong spot or just kill me without remorse. 

I feel like I’m fighting a battle I can’t win cause of the lies he tells everyone. It’s like he’s lying to ignore what he did himself. He doesn’t understand that what he did was not normal. 

What should I do?",CeesaR18,2020-03-22 20:47:13,4,932,17.54,85.6,19.19,1,16.95,14.91,94.96,64.16,25.75,19.21,7.19,1.39,0.32,9.87,0.43,6.55,3.43,14.16,8.48,7.4,8.15,1.82,20.39,3.22,2.04,2.25,0.86,0.97,6.33,1.29,5.04,0.32,2.04,0.97,21.57,1.93,1.18,1.82,9.76,11.16,2.15,1.93,1.07,1.39,2.04,3.33,3.43,0.43,2.25,0.75,0.97,0.43,0.32,0.21,0,9.44,4.61,2.04,1.93,0.64,1.07,9.55,9.55,1.5,14.06,2.79,6.01,6.22,0.43,0.32,0.64,0.11,0,0.43,0.75,0.32,0.32,0.11,0,0,13.3,6.01,3,0.21,0.21,0.43,0,0.21,0.32,1.82,1.07,0
fnei1h,"Tried to bring my girlfriend (F19) to her home before any sort of lockdown begins, abuse resumed the night I left her there","Tl;dr: What does one (in the US) do about a physically and mentally abusive parent, when calling the police or social services would likely result in a sibling being extracted from the home due to poor living conditions?

My girlfriend of several months had a very unconventional home situation, with an abusive mother and a negligent father. She was fortunate enough to move out to college where I met her, but she's still tried to maintain her ties with her family, especially because her sister (13) is still living with her parents.

Little over a week ago, our college announced that we would be getting sent home for an indefinite amount of time. It's become natural for her to come home with me over breaks, despite my house being inconveniently far from her house as well as from our college, so that's what she did and she stayed over for a week. Once rumors began spreading of a lockdown going into place in Pennsylvania, my parents decided that it would be a good time for me to take her home, and to an extent I agreed. She had tolerated being home the last few times that she was there, and she considers it important to spend time with her father and sister, so initially I didn't feel like taking her home meant I was intentionally dropping her off at the gates of hell.

An hour into my 3 hour drive back home, I got a text from my girlfriend asking if I could turn around and take her back with me. My parents remained firm in that they aren't prepared or willing to allow her to stay for an extended amount of time, so I guiltily continued my drive home. At that point, her mother had already begun being rude to her, swearing and demanding that she do things around the house that her mother should be capable of doing herself. Then, later that night, my girlfriend tried to intervene when her mother was berating her younger sister for (again) not meeting her needless demands. Instead of resorting to violence on her sister as her mother normally would at that point, her mother began to shout at her and hit her for ""trying to tell the parent how to parent"". After my girlfriend got away to check on her sister, her mother than began to go after her father, shouting at him and hitting him (for being the parent of she who tells the parent how to parent, I guess), and he resorted to walking out of the house and down the road, alone and in the dark. Since it had already reached that point on my girlfriend's first night home, she immediately reached out to find somewhere else to stay, and is now staying with a friend nearby.

This is only one example of what happens in the house, whether my girlfriend is there or not, and all of the aggression and violence stems from her mother. No one in the house feels safe because of her, and she routinely takes money out of the father's bank account and then runs off and spends it with other men, even though their income is barely liveable as it is.

Judging from all this, you'd think any of them would've seen it fit to call the police. The reason they don't feel they can is that their house is absolutely filled and cluttered with the mother's things to a hoarding extent. They fear that any intervening officials would deem the house unfit for the sister to live in, and that she would be lost to the system.

I've already lost one friend to the system for invalid reasons on behalf of CYS, and so personally I don't think involving authorities is worth the risk of my girlfriend losing her sister to the same system. So my question is, are there other actions that anyone in the house can take to have the mother removed/preventing from causing harm?",nmans01,2020-03-22 22:16:34,4,691,66.34,84.11,17.89,8.49,31.41,15.92,91.9,58.32,17.66,12.74,4.05,0.58,0.14,6.95,1.01,4.78,6.37,17.22,7.96,5.35,6.66,1.01,15.63,2.89,1.74,1.45,1.16,1.3,3.33,0.87,2.32,0.29,0.87,0.58,16.93,4.63,1.45,8.97,1.16,9.12,1.88,1.59,1.59,2.17,0.58,2.46,1.01,0.29,0.29,0.43,0.72,0,0.72,0,0,10.27,4.92,1.45,2.17,1.45,0.58,4.63,8.25,0.58,15.63,2.46,7.53,6.51,1.45,0.14,3.18,1.16,0.14,0,0.43,0.14,0,0.14,0.14,0,12.01,2.75,4.92,0.14,0.14,0.29,0,0,0.29,1.88,1.45,0.14
fnf7nn,My Father Relentlessly Abuses my Mom; Help!!!,"My mother (45) and my father (46) have been together for over 20 years, but got married 4 years ago. Shortly after I (18) was born, my mother and I moved away from my country in order for her to work and support the three of us. From as early as I can remember, they've argued every time we visited, mostly because of my father's prolific and continuous cheating, but they always patched things up until the next time.

My two siblings F(9) and M(6) were born, my mother and I eventually moved back home, they all moved away again and they finally got married after all those years. I moved away to an aunt for better high school opportunities, and the physical abuse began, in addition to the severe verbal and emotional abuse. It started with him hitting her in the face to shut her up, and has progressed to her being hit all over her body with several different household items from air freshener cans to knives to alcohol bottles, to choking and other forms of bodily torture. To add insult to injury, my father went and had an outside child one year ago. Bear in mind my mother has helped him in every facet of his life since they met, and this is what she gets. He's even said she deserves it and has cut me off since being confronted by me.

Because I'm still away at university, I have no means of helping to protect my siblings and my mom. So, the onslaught continues, and everyday I wait for the call with my mother sobbing at the latest mistreatment, powerless to make a change. He does this in the name of 'protecting the children' that he doesn't feed, take care of or financially support, and that are afraid of him. He refuses to leave where they live for the same reason. He uses threats and manipulations to get the responses he wants out of her, and she can't fight back because he is significantly larger than she is.

He says all kinds of vile things about her at their work that aren't true, and is just a monster overall. Mom has attempted to get help from pastors, but she can't go to the police or they'll both lose their jobs and the kids will go to CPS. The abuse is even worse with the COVID-19 lockdowns.

I need advice for her and the children, I genuinely fear for their lives every day, and my heart splinters and shatters when I think about all my siblings have seen and experienced. 

Please. I'm so tired of feeling so helpless. Any help or advice is appreciated.

fnqu8y,My [37M] Wife [37F] and I of 10 years argued. The cops were called. I need help.,"/r/relationship_advice directed me to post this here.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years, and together for 10. We have a wonderful amazing 18-month-old son. He is our world.

I work from home 60+ hours per week, and travel for work about 3 months total out of the year. Those 3 months are easily 100 hour weeks. The pay is ok, but it averages out to the same pay typically what we'd make if we each worked 40 hour weeks. We are on the verge of bankruptcy. The wife stays at home and takes care of our son.

Over the course of the previous few years, we have been arguing more frequently along with us being verbally more terrible towards each other. Last night it became physical. I never would have ever imagined being in this spot ever. Our argument started over the lack of me doing ""my fair share"" of household chores. I disagree with it considering I work so much and she's home all the time, raising our child, and putting some effort towards cleaning.

Alcohol was the explosive factor in this. Terrible things were said, a door was locked, I asked her to unlock the door so we could talk. More terrible things were said to me. I got upset and kicked in the door. She rushed to me and punched me and there was a scuffle while I pushed her away. She threatened to call the police, I told her to please do. She did. ""My husband is beating me, I need help.""

She had a difficult time communicating our address to the officer, she placed the call on speaker and I gave him the correct address. I grabbed our son and informed them that I would be downstairs, separated from her. 3 officers arrived I directed them to where she was. They questioned us both separately. I admitted to being stupid and kicking in the door and to pushing her away from me after she hit me. They were all very helpful and reassuring which was good to hear. At some point, we heard a scuffle, and I believe my wife was fighting or arguing with the officer questioning her.

My heart sank hearing my wife call my name asking for help. I love her dearly, and I wish we could argue in a healthier way. I miss the fun we've had.

The two other officers assisted the other officer and my wife. I heard them threaten to arrest her if she doesn't cooperate, and told her that I was cooperating.

They took photos of my hands, loaded me up, and took me to a hotel. I walked home this morning which took 4 hours. No words have been said to each other. I am so lost. I will never drink again, and I have enrolled in my first therapy session in regard to that which is tomorrow. What should my next steps be? What should our next steps be?

fnrlzh,Help. Please.,"Hi,

My boyfriend of four years hasn’t worked in three years. He hit me the first time in November 19, and just hit me again. He’s also addicted to drugs now. I am disabled and unable to work so I don’t have much money. I don’t know what to do, my entire family is deceased, and I am going to have to be hospitalized soon. He expects me to financially support him while I’m in the hospital (I’m taking my debit card and phone with me as he likes to Zelle from my checking account often). I don’t know what to do anymore.

fnztyq,"Pakistani forced into marriage, then domestic abuse, then rape","I'm writing this on behalf of a friend. She was brought up Muslim, but is very westernized. During the marriage she was lied to about who she was marrying, then told it would be shameful to go back on her word. This is all really simplifying things, because her own family, friends, inlaws, and cousins (and herself included) were brought up in this culture. She moved abroad to live with the husband after the marriage. 

&amp;#x200B;

The men in the family, including the one she's married to, will blow up over anything - most recently a trip to the dollarstore became a screaming match with her. The last time she was beat, it was rationalized by all aforementioned parties as justified because she hadn't had sex with him recently - something she gets forced into regularly because again the men are entitled to her body and she isn't islamically allowed to refuse him. She is still afraid of shaming her family if she leaves him, because they'll have to deal with the backlash alone in pakistan. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her plan right now is to wait until the next time she gets beat, so that she can use it as a justifiable reason to escape that her family may be able to use to defend themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to comment on that, I can't imagine what she's going through, or what it's like, or the courage it takes to deal with all of this. She's also worried about me being invested because she has had great luck finding insane man after insane man, who always end up trying to control her.",Man_Of_The_Forest,2020-03-23 22:42:13,0,281,53.93,91.73,4.85,6.19,23.42,18.51,92.17,59.43,18.86,12.1,1.42,0,0,9.96,0.71,6.76,5.69,17.08,11.03,3.91,7.12,1.42,17.44,4.98,2.85,1.42,0.36,1.42,4.63,1.42,3.2,1.07,1.07,0.36,19.22,3.91,0.71,8.9,2.85,13.17,2.49,5.34,1.07,3.2,1.42,2.49,0.36,0,0.36,0,1.42,0.36,0.36,0.71,0,12.81,4.63,1.78,4.63,1.78,0.71,5.69,9.96,2.85,15.66,2.85,5.69,7.47,0.71,1.78,1.78,0.71,0.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.22,3.91,6.05,0,2.14,0,0,0.71,0,3.56,0.71,2.14

fo0dht,I talked to a local deputy today.,"He gave me info for DV counselors in my area which he strongly urged me to talk to. I wasn't sure about taking any legal action yet, if any is possible. I think he mentioned something about filing a report if i wanted but I can't remember what he said because I think i disassociated at that point. Mental overload. I can't wrap my mind around the reality of this situation. 

 I want my husband out of the house before taking any legal action and to leave peacefully so he doesn't traumatize the kids with any drama. 

Trying to leave would be nearly impossible with him home 24/7. We've talked about getting counseling and I was hoping to tell one of them to suggest a ""temporary"" separation. If it was suggested as a positive thing as if to restore the marriage, then he could pack up peacefully and leave on his own. 

Since this is not our house, he would have no legal right to return and the owner (who also lives here) could tell him that he would be arrested if he comes back on this property because of trespassing. 

Even though he would know where we live, at least he wouldn't be legally allowed back on the property and we could call the cops if he showed up. 

And if he was moved out but found out or came to realize that there is no restoring the relationship, if he flips out, I can always take the kids and hide for a while. 

The problem is that I have been having trouble getting into contact with a counselor who could work with me on this. I've thought about not waiting for one and just going ahead and trying to suggest a separation myself but I have not been able to think about how to even bring it up. I feel stuck. I want him out asap but it has been difficult to get anything in motion. 

If it comes down to it, I'll take the kids and run.

fo4spr,My fiancé has become violent. What can I do ?,"Um I don’t know if pulling hair is real violence but he’s started to pull me by my hair to get me to face him and pay attention to him. 

He thinks because I’m not looking at him that I’m not listening to what he’s saying so he does that to get me to listen to him apparently. He’ll hold my head still by my hair forcing me to look up at him the whole time he’s talking and it just feels kind of humiliating I guess ? It also hurts because he’s not just tugging my hair he’s pulling it down on purpose. 


Another thing he’s started doing which I would say is kind of violence is he knees me in the lower back while I’m sleeping ? I know this sounds strange but he rams his kneecap right into my spine on my lower back. Usually when I’m asleep and when I wake up and try to move away he’ll hold me still and do it again. He claims he does it in his sleep and can’t help it but I can tell he’s awake and sometimes when I ask him to stop he’ll reply ‘shut up’ so I know he’s awake. 

I’ve many bruises on my lower back he’s done this many times. 

So yeah not really sure what to do about it. I have a very bad feeling like something would happen if I tried to leave him ? 

Also can’t really call police can I ? They’re not gonna do anything if all he’s doing is pulling my hair and kneeing me in my sleep?

fo72b2,"I literally need an encouragement. Please, kick my ass.","Long story short: I was emotionally, psychologically and sexually abused (meaning - **I was raped**) by my ex partner for 3 years. Apart from many things he took from me when I finally left (1.5 year ago), he also deleted me from our YouTube account, which was basically about me (climbing, healthy life style etc) and made a story full of lies for 40k people. The story was about me ofc.

It broke me down. Literally. I couldn't stop crying after what I saw (it also included the death of my dog...). Many people who I know believed him... It made me so sad/mad. **So I decided to analyse my relationship and put it on paper.** English is not my first language, but tbh, I write pretty good.  Some of my friends read it and **encouraged me to make a video**, as I am a video maker.

I want to do that, as it's teaching how to recognise the abuse, why abuser is an abuser and why victims can't / don't leave. It took me two months to write it. I'm confident it's good.

But then...**what if the video will get very little views. For me it sounds like it would be another victory for the abuser.** 

I know that video will be so soo good for many women (and men). It will open many eyes. But yet, there is a sot of fear, that man, who abused me will win again.   


What do you think? Just in general.

I can’t leave because I have no money and I have dogs. I wouldn’t be able to take them with me if I left and they’re my whole life. I have already looked into options for them so please I don’t need advice. 


Yesterday my abusive husband went on a Tinder hookup with a stranger. I got mad when he returned and told me that he did, because I’ve been confining and he messed it up. I told him to stay away from me.


This morning I bitched about the fact that he went on a date again, and I told him he was stupid. Arguing ensued and he came close to me. I told him to stay away and he refused. Then he licked my lips just to “infect”
me. 


I have been in contact with very, very few people in the last month and a half and he messed it up. 


I lost it. We argued some more and he beat me, strangled me several times, sat on my chest, slapped me etc. 


Only good thing is that now I know his moves, so I knew how to defend myself a little better. But he still got me since he’s like double my size. 


At some point he said “there’s a kind of abuse where the abuser pushes their partner to hit them just so they can have power” or something like that. So he called ME the abuser there. Which just shows he would do anything to not take responsibility.


He said proof that I was that type of abuser was that those abusers lived a parasitic lifestyle.
I am not a parasite. I used to work, but his frequent beatings have made me terrified of working now. I made more money than him in 2018. And at home I do all the cleaning, I care for the animals, and I run the errands. All he does is sleep and work for his mother who overpays him because no one else would hire him.


He finally left.

fob4xi,I hit my mother yesterday,"Our relationship has become really toxic in the past two years when she literally chose the people who were abusing me verbally, financially and physically and refused to help me when I begged her for help. She told me people will make fun of me if they get to learn that I am going to psychiatrist when I mustered up the courage to her about my depression and insomnia. She also told me how I will be a coward of I commit suicide when I told her I am suicidal. 


I started resenting her after that. Although I still supported and protected her and my aunt when aunt's son would get into their faces during fights which would end up in me getting hit by him. One day my mother did something I begged her not to but she didn't listen and told my aunt's daughter something which resulted in me getting beat up again later. And I lost it, that was the first time I smacked her and after that I hit her two more times in the next 1 year. 

The latest being yesterday, she made me withdraw thousands of money to help my aunt's another daughter and I lost my mind. I kept warning her that they would ask us for money and to shut them down but she didn't listen. She never listens. So I hit her. I hit her multiple times and with force this time. I slapped her and I felt to sympathy and no guilt. 


But today, the sound of the impact that my punches made iwhen I was hitting her is haunting me. I keep hearing it and I want to hold her beg her for forgiveness but I also loathe her for not saving me when I needed her the most.

I went from being an abused person to an abusive person myself.

Tldr: mother didn't save me when I begged her help whilst getting abused financially, verbally and physically. Made me withdraw tons of money and i went from being an abused person to an abusive person myself.",moonchild_purple,2020-03-24 12:14:52,0,353,15.56,50,57.26,3.75,18.58,13.88,94.62,59.49,27.48,23.23,14.16,0.57,0,7.37,1.13,4.25,3.97,10.48,5.95,4.53,9.63,1.98,16.43,2.55,1.7,3.12,1.7,1.42,5.1,1.42,3.68,0.28,2.27,0.85,18.98,2.83,0.28,9.63,0.57,9.35,1.13,1.98,1.7,1.13,0.57,3.4,1.7,0,1.42,0.28,1.42,0.28,1.13,0,0,8.5,2.27,1.13,4.53,1.42,0.57,8.22,5.38,0.85,12.46,0.85,2.83,8.78,0.85,0.28,0,1.7,0,0.57,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,0,8.5,5.1,1.42,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,1.7,0,0

fp34ql,"SURVEY: Self-Quarantine Risks &amp; Repercussions: Physical Safety, Mental Health, and Nonconforming Identities. [Help a Graduate Student with Research]","Hey guys! Since I know everyone is spending way too much time at home on the internet and hopefully feeling bored enough to complete a survey about the how the recently imposed self-isolation ordinances have impacted your interpersonal relationships, your identity, and your overall wellbeing - I thought I'd try to enlist the reddit community for help.


The survey data will be used for research purposes (unpublished graduate coursework in preparation for creating my thesis project) and since current research and mainstream media are purely concerned with economic or respiratory illness effects (therefore there are ZERO peer-reviewed journals to gain relevant information) - I thought I would try to utilize my own survey to try to understand some of the social/psychological symptoms of the current global crisis.


TAKE IT HERE: https://forms.gle/e4WjdsmvwHzopSm88



Read about it below:

Firstly,

THANK YOU! I appreciate your time &amp; effort to provide much need info regarding the sidelined conversations concerning recently imposed self-isolation ordinances. 


This survey will ask you questions regarding the impact of this current global crisis on your physical, mental, emotional, sexual, financial, psychological, and social wellbeing.


This research is for a graduate seminar course and will not be published. I am hoping to further investigate this topic for my future thesis project. The purpose of this survey is to provide a preliminary understanding surrounding the traumas and trials of people existing outside of the media's current attention - since there are currently no supplementary publications on this topic thus yet, I figured I'd try to gather some of my own data.


Secondly,

Please note that this survey is 100% ANONYMOUS. If you choose to email me outside of the survey, all of your personal information will be kept private.


Thirdly,

Please feel free to skip ANY question that doesn't pertain to you or makes you feel uncomfortable. You can answer as many or as few questions as you so choose.


Thank you again for being willing to share your story!


Fourthly,

SHARE THIS SURVEY! Again, there isn't ANY academic information currently available on this topic which means people are suffering in silence while the world's attention is elsewhere. There are many more ways this virus can hurt people than just causing a respiratory infection. The topics discussed in this survey are an extremely important part of maintaining a 'healthy population' and hopefully the more popular this gets - the more visible it becomes.


Thank you!

fp6k4o,Resources during covid-19 (copied from r/all),"Due to increased social and physical distancing as a response to COVID-19, many domestic violence victims are at greater risk of abuse due to:

isolation, through which abuse thrives,

fewer opportunities for social support,

fewer public venues and events through which victims may be able to seek help or flee, and

close confinement with an abuser.

Many abusive partners are also using COVID-19 as an opportunity to further gaslight, control, and isolate potential abuse survivors by:

withholding and limiting food,

withholding medical supplies,

preventing a potential survivor from accessing medical care,

confiscating a potential survivor's devices, preventing communication with advocates and hotlines, and

escalating physical abuse for which potential survivors may be hesitant--or unable--to seek medical care due to an already overloaded healthcare system.

Below are some resources for domestic violence victims to utilize during this pandemic.
The National Domestic Violence Hotline is still running its 24/7 crisis hotline (1−800−787−3224) with trained advocates and also offers a safety planning guide for victims during COVID-19. https://www.thehotline.org/2020/03/13/staying-safe-during-covid-19/
The National Sexual Assault Hotline is also still running 24/7 crisis advocacy at 800.656.HOPE (4673) and through chat at https://www.rainn.org/.
The Family Sanctuary offers a comprehensive safety planning list for victims during COVID-19, which includes strategies for maintaining the safety of children, safety within confined households, compiling important documents and an emergency bag, creating social support, and planning with food and medicine. https://sanctuaryforfamilies.org/safety-planning-covid19/

fp7wc5,Abuser has been talking about killing himself.,"Today abusive bf spoke about killing himself if he ever catches corona. Then tonight he started telling me about a famous person who killed his wife, kid and then himself and the way he spoke about it was scary as he talked about the man like he wasn't a monster and that he snapped under stress. This combined with him talking about wanting to buy a gun is worrying me big time. Also him telling me he'd kill me if he saw me with another guy. As soon as I get a corona payment next week I'm using it for bond and getting into a unit asap. I've believed for months that he would kill me eventually and I feel like it's getting closer.

fpe6bx,I’m lockdown with violent husband,"My husband is violent, I’ve always managed to diffuse arguments and stay relatively away from him to avoid angering him. I’ve been doing this for months. 

He would mostly just intimidate me/yell and scream at me and sometimes he’d slap me. 

Now that we’re in lockdown I’m stuck inside with him and he’s more angry than he’s ever been because were stressed about money because I was laid off from work recently so money is very tight and he’s taking his stress out on me because it’s my fault we’re not making as much money. 

I’m no longer able to diffuse his anger he hit me yesterday. He’s never hit me before only slapping. 

I’m finding it incredibly hard to leave him and now I feel like it’s just getting harder for me 😞 

I feel so dumb and weak because I should just leave him and all my problems would go away but I just can’t see a way out right now. 

I internally freak out / panic when he’s near it’s completely exhausting and so stupid. 

He seems to just know everything. He’s always pointing out flaws in everything I do. It’s incredibly frustrating. He knows I won’t leave. He use to get angry when I’d say I was leaving but now he just smiles at me like he’s so certain I can’t leave. 

I don’t know.

I’m flabbergasted and very scared! The news said that violent offenders would NOT be part of the release of inmates taking place because of Covid-19. 

He has not yet been sentenced for his violent crimes against me. The charges are very serious and include assault, assault with a weapon and forcible confinement. He is looking at federal time when sentenced.

I told him a lot of the worst of it, including about my husband talking a lot about killing us. I had hoped that maybe my dad would offer some kind of help. Nope, certainly not my dad.

His response was that family seems to be a stressor for my husband and that we need counseling asap. He expressed a lot of concern for my husband and merely told me that if I felt in danger that I should take the help offered (by the dv organization). 

Gee, thanks, dad. 

There's a reason why it never occurred to me to talk to my dad sooner. He has consistently failed me throughout my life and has only had a negative impact on me. 

I've decided to pose the separation as a positive thing for my husband so that he's more likely to agree to it. If he doesn't agree, then I'll take the kids and run because I will have no other option and he keeps talking every single day about getting a gun. I'm not sticking around for that.

fprwum,"All the shades of abuse, how he cut me off from anyone, from himself and instead encouraged a introduction with his emotional affair partner","His abuse is not just physical and psychological, he abuses me by social disconnection. I guess he feels shame and realizes in small corner of his mind how monstruos he behaves so he simply cut me off. His mom didn't see me for last two years. He blame me yet he knew that I would not go after his abuse because I can't speak with this woman looking her into her eyes and omit the fact how awful her son is, especially because she endures abuse from him, and her husband, too.

He cut me off from some people in his life by spreading lies about how I'm mentally ill. My mom is schizophrenic and I've made a mistake when I confessed that to him in beginning of our relationship. Now he regularly hits in a weak spot by telling me that I'm crazy, that I hear voices. His friend looked at me with some mix of fear, disgust and aleterness the last time he spoke to me, and the last time when he was here, on the birthday of our kid, he didn't say a thing to me. 

I made a cake for our apartment owner, I don't know right term how you call people from who you rent an apartment. She has my phone nb but she decided to reply to him about my cake. He didn't bother to transfer what she said.

Finally, he has a neighboor with whom he is close, she is sexually attractive and flirts with him for I don't know how long, they know each other three years while our own relationship only degraded further in that time, and between them two grew.

I found his messages to her. They are sexual teasings:

*Him: Hi, how is it going?
She: Good. I don't know what to prepare for lunch today. I don't have cigarettes. 
She: How are the kids?
Him: They are in grandma backyard, clap-clap [as approval]. Make a soup. It's healthy.
She: Is it not dangerous to bring kids to grandma now? She is old. [covid19]
Him: don't ... [as in don't bother me]
She: okay, I won't
She: I saw your wife outdoor with kids.
Him: She can go to school yard few steps away but she won't go with them in a walk around block.
She: At least she went out :laughing to tears smiley:
She: What book are you reading?
Him: I'm reading Bukowski, he is fucking a lot, he writes short but witty.
She: all you think about is fucking, poor Noahloahboah :laughing smiley:
Him: please, don't
She: clap clap :three laughing to tears smileys: [this completely changes its earlier meaning more towards slap-slap, as in slap from behind in sex]
Him: children playground at noon? [with kids]
She: no, i'm afraid of covid19 and kid is sleeping.
Him: covid19 party
She: hahha*

If she teases him and provoces responses that much in text messages I can expect, now that I've seen, what she does in person. She constantly triggers sexual associations. Their whole interaction comes to that because I've noticed he doesn't know some common information that people who hang that much would knew about. I guess they solely speak in sexual conotations and poke each other.

I was crushed emotionally when I read that. I was hurt and mad. And I annoyed him about him mocking me with her, referring to incident in Feb, when she took visit to our home, for kids to play, and she said to me, again as a sexual insinuation, after being curious about how we met and I said it was food that joined us:
- So, you like pizza (which is another meaning for pussy in our language)? Here she starts giggling, laughing for several minutes.
He comes, stands in fron of her, and claps to her with his hands, giving her appraisal for the ""excellent joke"" and calls her with specific name people use here when you pown someone. She continues laughing. 

Later in kitchen, she told him ""Something is boiling down here."" referring to oven, but with extended laughing it again switches to sexual implication, because it has double meaning in our language.

Lastly, she asks me whether we as a family would come to her place next time, I reply with ""See this with him"", and she goes playfully to him, and says: ""Your wife said I should ask you to agree for a play"", and again extended giggling and laughing. She acts as a horny teenager. I remember when all my collegues were capable to talk about in high school were just such jokes. And the ones who were more into it were actually signalizing they are more than ready to have sex. I also doubt she has some insecurities is she feels a need to slam someone she barely knows. Last thing is, he says about her that she knows everyone in neighborhood. If that's true she must have heard thst he is an abuser. Why is she that interested in him then?

I complained these days a lot and poked him, and I bite, and I cried. He was defending himself with ""It's not your business."" and tons of insults, and at rare moments with ""There's nothing between me and that woman."", ""We never met together."". He said that this how they speak and how them two speak with me is a completely normal discussion and why haven't I met someone and invited. I wanted to invite my school friends ten ten years ago but I decided I don't want them to meet him because he would probably be rude, and they would understand he is an asshole. I don't like type of people he likes. He would not socialize nor accept people I do.

A day after my birthday he could not handle all these accussations well, after he found me smoking a cigarette [on a window] and crying at 3 am, after which he threw up in toilet for next 20 minutes at 4 am [since he drinks alcohol daily] and then when I wanted to take dogs in a walk he stopped me, he said he will. I took water and a wiper and got myself to clean floor. Here he comes 15 minutes later and tells ne he will wipe the floor and that I should go with dogs. Or whatever I want from that two. I said I'll go with dogs, and later take kids and he can lie down as a lazy ass. Here he goes mad. Tells me that I should not take kids in a walk anymore. That hurt me since I read his messages where his emotional affair partner mocks me. I go mad and reffer all back to her. He got down on me, hit me in my back, legs, punched me with his fist right into middle of my chest, hit me on my head several times, broke my eardrum [I hope it's only that since I don't hear now on right ear well].

With people with whom he doesn't speak, our building, he expresses some even fearfull reactions. Like, when he discovered that our first neighboor talks about his abusiveness around to people. He immediately told me that I can choose between him or her, and if I choose her he will be my enemy. As if he is not now.

Our second neighboor gave clothes to our kid. Handed it to him. I wanted to knock down on the doors and thank for it and give back piece of barbie doll clothes that stuck with clothes. He freaked out.

Third neighbors he cut off due to giving beer to their three year old, allegedly. I'm not sure about that because they seem normal, and the woman is a teacher. I suspect they've told him something about him abusing me and maybe he just doesn't want to be ashamed further.

Our other neighboor had fire in his apartment but he seems as a good person. My partner talked shit about him.

A woman who works in fast food near us, came to our apartment once, was nice with me, always said hello. He talked shit about her, too.

Lastly, a guy who comes from place where my partner's mom comes, doesn't even greet me when he sees me.

Finally, he locked down his phone, not telling me a slight sense about where has he been with kids, I'm excluded and cut of from his mind and life as a cancer. He is just keeping me here while kids are too young.

This is toxic environment. He is narciss, psychopat, sociopath, abuser. I want to leave and I can't. I'm broke. We are all in middle of this covid19 crisis. I don't know how to deal with this shit in front me. I endured his abusiveness somehow till the point that he is wide openly jerking on a woman that lives in next building. For three years. He thinks he doesn't have anything with her just because he didn't stick his dick yet, although he did that thousands of times already.

I'm weak, broken, ashamed, slamed to the bottom.",noahloahboah,2020-03-26 23:13:03,0,1552,20.14,86.89,12.33,7.29,16.17,14.11,93.81,59.6,25.32,20.23,7.09,1.22,0.64,10.31,0.97,5.09,2.96,13.53,7.8,6.31,7.22,2.51,16.95,4.32,1.93,2.64,1.29,1.87,7.15,2.77,4.38,0.52,2,0.58,22.1,0.64,0.58,4.25,7.02,10.95,2.45,2.13,1.68,1.93,1.16,2.51,3.29,0.52,2.32,0.39,3.54,1.16,0.84,0.84,1.03,6.19,3.29,0.32,1.68,0.58,0.32,4.51,11.08,0.77,13.98,1.93,6.25,5.99,0.9,0.84,0.97,0.19,0.06,0,0.9,0.64,0,0.13,0.13,0,18.81,5.93,5.35,1.8,0,0.45,0,0.19,0.9,2.9,0.13,1.16
fpx51c,What do you understand of this situation?,"Hello, I have felt lonely and shameful in this issue for a very long time and wish to know if anyone has something to say about it, because I need to be honest and to forgive myself for it, to have some clarity on it.

First of all, you have to understand that when I was 13 years old, my father had an accident and his legs stopped working, he went to the hospital in re-education. Soon after this, my mother became paranoid, to the point of accusing my father and other people we knew, of watching us with cameras, entering in our home and tearing holes in my little brother's sockets and clothes (I know how stupid it sounds). I guess I can add that my brother is only my half-brother, that my mom had with another man, and that my father, after being apparently (I do not remember) a bit rough with my mom when she was pregnant, finally accepted as a son (of course, their love never really recovered, and maybe my mom felt guilty). Anyway, when my mom was paranoid, she had those moments where she was taken by disgust, anger and was not facing reality. My parents were slowly getting a divorce. She once told me that when she moved out, she would never give the key to her flat to me. I asked her if she did not trust me, she did not answer, looking at me with fear and anger. I will always remember this. Meanwhile, my dad was learning how to walk again, but he would never be able to do it as he used to, he ended up in a wheelchair. A lot of people around us admired him, and so we did (as his children), because he had so much willpower, he ended up building his own company of handisport skiing. My mother went to the hospital for some months, we moved in with my father. I was a teenager and I did not feel understood by anyone, my older sister moved out and was supported my her friends, and my dad was trying to push really badly meetings between me, my young brother and I with women we had never of, because of wanting to rebuild himself. Fearing of ever becoming like my mother (who I felt had been selfish and had given up on her family), and wanting to be like my father, I eventually built myself into a person who always had to be brave, to be supportive and who had to give everything in her relationships.

The truth is that I was not that combative and more of a peaceful person. As such, I used to hate myself and my calm demeanor to the point of being able to put on the expected happy face and to overly joke in social situations, to perform in order to be appreciated. I used to very rarely do it, only sometimes with the people I felt uncomfortable with and barely knew, while having close friends who I could be myself as a whole. But here's the thing: I met someone who seemed pretty harsh but who had been hurt badly by his past relationship. We started talking and joking, and I felt attracted by several aspects of him, notably that he seemed kind albeit being very rude in his way of speaking and joking (like he wanted to actually give his best in all aspects of his life, even in his relationships), I knew I did not feel very comfortable with him, but he made clear that he was impatient and needed an answer soon. I was naive and suggestible, and I knew he was hurting, so I decided to give a shot at being with him.

Very soon, I realized that he was pretty soft inside and showed a lot of love and tenderness in his gestures, but he also said very rude things (example: he used to say ""we'll make do with what we've got"" about me to tease me, so one day as we were joking and he kinda mocked me I answered ""you're right but hey, you make do with what you've got"" and he said ""yes, until I find a funnier girlfriend"". I got angry in public, told him ""This is disrespectful"", he answered while laughing ""Yes"", and then he avoided me the entire afternoon, as we were in a protest march. I was crying because I was in love for the first time and I was scared, and two of our friends told me ""You know he is like that"" so I started feeling guilty, and ended up apologizing.) Other things among this, at first he used to tell me things like ""Don't touch me"" and once he told me to shut up in front of his friends (to which I actually made clear that I would not stand for, so he stopped).

Over text, I felt like he was trying really hard to conquer me and made quite an effort of being way nicer than he actually showed IRL, using flattery in jokes, but still fell for it nonetheless. So one month in, I told him I loved him, and he answered he felt like he had the same feelings, but at the same time, he repeatedly told me for several months that he did not believe in love because it was not necessary.

I could not feel comfortable with him but somehow I thought it was my fault because I was unable to entirely be myself (I spoke about it to only one friend, who kept telling me ""Just be yourself""), I felt like I did not have the place that my sensitivity needed, but I also knew how much he was hurting, and kept focusing on this. He was slowly opening his heart to me, but he was still very rude. I told him at some point that I was forcing myself to joke at times, because of feeling uncomfortable. He answered ""You do not have to force yourself to make your stupid boyfriend laugh"". So you see, the thing is that he truly did not do it on purpose. He just could not understand my sensitivity. I must add however that he was always being dismissive in his jokes, telling me I had two left hands when knocking over something, or that I was air-headed when forgetting something, rarely ever giving me compliments or tender words. He also avoided my hand without telling me anything when I wanted to take it in the street. He also often sulked, falling asleep without actually talking about problems when we had a conflict, while I stayed awake, anxious about it. I must add that having seen how heartbroken he was because of his past relationship, I was also very scared of hurting him. Every conflict, I tried to solve by being nice. And it only went up as time passed. At first, I could defend myself, but on the long term, he often rationnalized his behaviour and convinced me that maybe I was wrong, so I then stopped talking about every issue. 

Nonetheless, he was also slowly opening up and being nicer. 7 months in, he told me he loved me and weirdly I did not feel much about it, even though I answered I was glad.... but never wanted to break up (I have no rational answer for this, the only time I was presented with this option, I just said NO, could not explain it). 8 months in, he moved in with our friends. I was slowly not only just overly joking in some situations but literally taking a funny persona most of the time because he had hurt me too many times. I know how bad that sounds. I was ashamed of this, talked about it to a friend, she told me to be myself. So I kept trying to be myself. But the people he lived with was the first group of ""close friends"" I truly ever had (or so I thought), and they liked this part of me, so I kept doing it, at least somewhat. And I also had a lot of fun with them. I have to add that he was respected, admired and idealized by all of them, his voice was always more important than anyone else's, and I was by then idealizing him too (by always being focused on his physical tenderness and qualities instead of the whole of him), but I was tricking myself into thinking I did not. I thought I truly understood him. We had incredible conversations and sometimes laughed a lot, but I was slowly giving myself away, because no matter how much I told him how some of the things he said hurt me, he could not understand the exact nature of the problem. He then started telling me I was dramatizing, and he told that to our friends as well. So all my friends kept telling me ""You know he is like this"" or ""It's not that bad"" when I was trying to speak about it, and my sister also told me ""You can break up"", while also telling me ""But if you don't feel like you have done what you can, keep going"" (a family business). 10 months in, one friend told me ""You have become the shadow of yourself"". I could not speak about my feelings anymore and felt completely lost, I thought everything happening was my fault and that I was indeed dramatizing, so I kept fighting for it without telling: but I looked lost and empty whenever he was not around. I was also growing into thinking I did not want to care for myself and could not care less about it. Then I had a panic attack, and I decided to break up. I told him I still did not feel comfortable around him and that I wanted to break up, he answered he did not understand, convinced me to stay. I then started to think that I should maybe see a psychiatrist to help the issue, as I had grown into being completely lost about my own feelings about him. He told me ""Yes, you love him, and considering your age (25), you should move in with him to see if that is working"". So that was a bad advice but it reassured me (as I wanted to stay), so I told him that positive information (without telling him I actually went because I was lost about our relationship). 

I felt more and more empty, and only felt safe when I was in his arms. To celebrate our one year, I was still pretty excited and decided to give my best to do something cool, giving him different options on what we could be doing. He said he'd be free. One day before the actual date, he said he wanted to see his parents and he would go home during the morning. I had to argue for 20 minutes straight to actually get him to stay. That often happened, as he took priority in everything he wanted to do. At the time, I was still feeling completely lost and empty, could not talk much anymore, did not care at all for myself. Several days I broke into tears, telling him I had given up on myself. He did not understand. The next month, I broke up.

During the months following the issue, as we had the same group of friends, we had to see each other and was often rude to me. I tried to speak to him about it and told him he was selfish but he just rationnalized his behaviour, saying there was nothing else he could do to protect himself. We then decided to avoid each other as much as possible and to not speak to each other for several months. 

He has very recently apologized for the fact that our relationship was unbalanced: I was protecting him like a child and he was protecting himself. Although my issue is that every time I speak to him, I cannot help but be taken back, I cannot help but feel unsafe (everything is still very much about him, there has never been equality in how much we give, but it's like I am drawn to this again), I show distance, but he then managed to show he his a nice person at heart, and suddenly I feel like I still have feelings for him, and then I start trying to overly joke to make him happy (??) and I hate myself for it. I am always tempted to speak to him again. I do not understand how is it possible to be so fearful of him while also having feelings for him. I know there is addictive behaviour involved, but I do not understand myself, I don't understand how I could have gone this far with him and why I gave up on myself.",Chatppuccino,2020-03-27 06:42:39,0,2174,13.73,58.9,61.9,27.3,26.51,14.4,96.46,64.58,24.01,18.72,9.84,1.15,0.97,6.58,0.18,5.29,2.9,13.75,9.75,7.54,9.2,2.39,21.3,4.19,2.39,1.66,1.01,2.53,6.9,3.5,3.4,0.87,0.78,0.92,16.74,1.24,0.69,1.1,6.58,16.19,4.14,1.79,1.98,2.62,2.12,4.37,3.68,0.74,1.06,1.89,1.1,0.41,0.37,0.05,0,8.1,3.36,1.61,1.75,0.83,0.97,10.95,6.62,0.83,13.02,1.66,5.24,6.3,0.51,0.74,0.18,0.09,0,0,0.41,0,0.05,0.23,0.05,0.05,14.58,3.82,6.58,0.18,0,0.14,0,0.14,1.47,0.6,1.66,0
fpy7nh,Can this be classified as domestic abuse/physical violence?,"
Hello there. This is a throwaway account. 

I kind of just wanted to ask for your opinion on this since I’m not sure if what I have experienced counts as domestic abuse since it isn’t too dramatic and probably not as horrible compared to what others have experienced. 

Someone I’ve lived with has a really bad temper. He would usually put the blame on me if he did something wrong/forgot something etc, he couldn’t deal with it in his head - lash out and then punch me in the arm, chest area, not too bad but I got bruises from it. I don’t think he was aware of what he was doing I guess he just doesn’t know how to deal with it in his head. I’m taking care of most of the household, since I’m still in education, whenever something goes wrong like I didn’t put enough softener in the laundry etc. he makes me feel like I’m inept. I don’t know if I’m being whiny right now, it’s just making me really sad. Anyway, the punching has stopped mostly, it kind of shifted to just telling me I’m useless/inept/etc. without touching me physically. 

Would you say this is abuse? Am I just too sensitive here? I honestly don’t know since I’ve never had lots of close relationships with people. Am I the one who’s making the mistakes here? I really do not know.",annamalika,2020-03-27 07:50:55,13,244,8.97,10.21,60.15,1,14.35,16.39,92.62,63.93,22.54,14.75,10.25,0,0.82,3.69,0,7.79,3.69,13.11,14.34,9.43,4.92,5.33,23.77,4.51,2.87,2.46,0.41,0.82,6.97,1.23,5.74,0.41,2.05,0.82,8.2,0,0,0,3.69,20.49,2.87,3.28,3.28,6.56,0.82,6.15,2.05,0,0.41,0.82,2.87,1.64,1.23,0,0,4.51,0.82,0,0.82,0.82,2.05,4.1,15.98,0.41,10.25,1.23,4.51,4.51,0.41,0.41,1.64,0.41,0,0,0.41,0,0,0,0,0.41,19.26,5.33,3.28,0,0,1.64,0,0.41,0,6.97,0,1.64

fq5o5r,Police borderline harassing me to serve me subpoena,So I pressed charges last year and I guess his court date is coming up. But- it’s in literally SIX months! The police have been coming to my house every few days for weeks (I’m never home when they do) And they’ve been leaving little notes on my door asking to call them about the subpoena. Which I did literally over 10 times and I’ve left 3 messages. I never got a call back and they keep coming to my house. I asked them in the voicemail to please stop coming to my house and that I would pick it up myself. They don’t listen and they never call me back but today they left a rude ass note on my door saying they were done playing phone tag and to tell them at what time I would be home in the morning. Now I’m completely turned off... I’m literally the victim in the situation they’re acting like I have a warrant out for my arrest. And the court date isn’t for another 6 months... also it’s embarrassing I live in an upscale building I don’t necessarily want the police knocking on my door every other day!!!!

fq6g88,"Girlfriend got into a fight with family and had to run away, need advice","Last night my girlfriend (17) got into a fight over a small problem and it escalated to her being hit my her mother and having to run from her home.   Her phone is broken and stuff is with her parents. I have pictures of marks, her neighbors witnessed it, and I have screenshots of messages from her brother. She refuses to get police or cps involved. Her parents are extremely manipulative and are holding her college money, car, and whatever else they can over her. She needs to commit to a college by April 1st. She can stay with my family or has a friend but her parents are using quarantine to try and get her home tonight, saying that if she stays somewhere else she is not welcome back because of it. The only exception right now is if her mom enters my family’s property we will call the police. I also gave her a small thing of pepper spray I keep in my car in case she is attacked again. Not sure if that’s a good idea. 

I am worried for her and her younger siblings safety I feel if any case can be made legally it could at least help her siblings. She turns 18 in about a month.

fqbkre,Domestic Violence situation Quebec Canada PLEASE HELP,"Hello,

I got into some serious trouble that will end my life. My life as I know it is over.

My girlfriend got into an escalated argument because I had been unfaithful. She has been pestering me about this issue for many months and I exploded. I locked her out of our apartment for 20 minutes. Once I unlocked the door she came to my face and started pushing me, I started breaking her make up. The fight kept on going and neither of us would let up. I got desperate to make her leave me alone so I grabbed a knife and pointed it at her and told her STOP, YOU BETTER STOP. I put the knife away thereafter.

Afterwards She told me OMG did you just point a knife at me? I'm calling 911! I told her yea whatever and gave her my phone and went on the couch to continue reading my book. I thought she was bluffing, she knows that I would never hurt her.. I was shocked to find that she actually called 911 and told them my boyfriend threatened me with a knife. I immediately got up and looked at her thinking 'omg she actually did that' I grabbed my stuff and ran out of the apartment, utterly terrified. The cops spent 4 hours with her in our apartment while I was gone. I came back home at looked at her and said 'youre dead to me' and went to sleep on the couch, still not believing what she had done.

The next morning the door knocked and 6 cops came in and arrested me. I spent 8 hours in jail before the detective told me I had 3 charges against me 'Threatening with a knife' 'Locking her out of her apartment' and 'Grabbing or hurting her arm' He made me sign a no contact order to under no circumstances directly or indirectly speak with her and I got kicked out of my apartment.

The detective told me a day later that my GF had left the apartment and that now I can go back.

Here are some facts about this case

1. My girlfriend had NO bodily harm or mark showing that I hurt her (I didn’t hurt her at all)
2. She will NOT be pressing charges
3. She herself is doing everything she can to have the charges against me dropped and her parents are willing to testify on my behalf that I am not a bad person
4. The detective on the case told me that the prosecutor will likely drop the charges without bringing them to court as the victim (my gf) has sent them an email telling them that I am a good person and that this was just an escalated fight and that this was the first time this ever happened. She stated she does not fear for her life and that I am not a danger.
5. My GF also mentioned to the detective on the case that she was spraying water on me and that she shared responsibility for our fight escalating
6. I am a Canadian Permanent resident who is supposed to apply for his passport or citizenship in a month or so
7. I do NOT have any criminal record or any previous police reports
8. My GF is doing everything she can to have the no contact order removed so she can move back in with me and resume our life (We still love each other and want to be together and we both understand that we both made mistakes in this situation)
9. I heard that this CORONAVIRUS period is resulting in many domestic violence calls to be coming in around the country due to elevated stress. I heard that The courts will have to filter the worthy cases from the unworthy ones

I cannot afford a lawyer so I wont be getting one. Instead I am here on Reddit trying to get any advice, tips or predictions on what might happen to me.

I have accepted that my life is over but what do you all think?

Do you think the prosecutor who has received the 3 charges of Domestic Violence will drop them or take them to court?

Will this affect my ability to apply for my Canadian Citizenship?

How long before I see my loved one again (My gf)

The likelihood of me getting a criminal record?

If so, will Canada remove my permanent residence status and deport me back to my country of origin?

Please help me I am depressed and broken and I do not know what to do.

fqdmbl,I can't remember the abuse unless I force myself to,"I went on a vacation recently with my ex bestfriend. We became friends with benefits 2 weeks before vacation. Throughout the trip, he pushed me to my emotional limits (my reactions) by purposely making me jealous, ignoring me, making me need his attention and validation. He was also the first person i kissed and had sex with. He knew that.

During the trip, he would not stop calling me clingly at first just because I wanted affection and the only time I would receive it, would be after I gave him head. Which is something he ""needed"" every single morning and almost every night. Then it moved to him pinching me and leaving bruises from those pinches when I would get on his nerves or be annoying. Then he would slap my arm, if I got on his nerves. Then, one morning he fingered me and an extremely thin line of my period blood was on his finger. It was so thin, it was barely visible. And despite me telling him it may even be blood from my hymen due to the color and the fact that we've had sex twice and I'm extremely tight. He punished me by kicking me off the bed, choking me till i apologized for the blood, manipulating him into wanting to have sex and then promising to suck his dick whenever he wanted to. After that, I proceeded to suck his dick while crying. He didnt know I was crying bcus I turned my head around and he constantly said throughout the trip that ""he wouldnt stop till he saw me cry"". 

Then, the next day, he posts a video of me screaming on his snapchat story, embarassing me infront of all his friends on the app. Who all know me as well. And he only deleted it after forcing me to watch it and even going out of his way to make me turn the volume up because he couldn't hear it. Leading me to cry in a cab to our airbnb while he continued exploring the city we were staying in. 

The next morning, I was afraid to wake up and had a nightmare that 20 clones of him were watching me in my sleep. He tried having sex that morning. And i refused. The next day, he kicked me in the head as i tried to join him and my ""friend"" in bed (we were sleeping in a tent outside a mansion). And he made me sleep in the cold, on a couch in the tent (no heating), while him and my ex friend (no longer speak to her) cuddled in a heated bed.

 Then on the last day of the trip, I finally cried. Why I broke on the last day of the trip? I mimicked his voice and he hit me in the face and then told me I was the reason my mom was crippling in debt and falling into poverty (something I told him in confidence). This was after we fought in a Popeyes, fought outside the Popeyes (throwing food), also he hit me in the face in front of a young boy and his father. And played the music loud as I cried. 

Our friendship, communication, etc is all over now. I tried talking to him on our 12hr+ drive back home and he turned it into a discussion (only him talking) about how it is all my fault because of the way I acted at his brother's house on day 1-3 on the trip, told me to tell no one about the trip, he's done being my friend etc etc etc. Had I never told one of my friends, I would have believed him. There is more to the story but essentially, it has been 1 month since this happened. I find myself glorifying the friendship we had, thinking about all the things he did for me (get me a new phone, fly me out for the vacation, help me find a job) and I always forget the abuse. verbal, physical and emotional. Until I force myself to. He was an amazing friend, but a terrible person in relationships. Everytime i'm horny I think of him. I hate it. I can't even open up to my other friends because I feel like I'm violating his privacy, dont want him to hurt me for ruining their perception of him and I think deep down I want him to come back, and if I were to tell our friends what happened. It would ruin any chance.

Finally, I feel when I tell this story. Im manipulating the truth. I'm lying. That's also holding me back from telling our friends, I feel as if I'm playing a blame game. Manipulating the truth. And it makes me question if I'm only telling them because I want them on my side.

fqef3e,Does the Deep Anger EVER Go Away? 🤦🏾‍♀️,"Hi Everyone,

I was abused in every way until the age of 23 by different people, and I just turned 24 two weeks ago. However, the worst abuse or the worst abusers I had in my life was in the hands of my step brother, his father and my own blood brother (which ended in a arrest last May). 

My step father abused me physically while his son abused me sexually between the ages of 4-7. The step brother also “molested” my blood brother by humping him with their clothes on, but with me the step brother sexually assaulted me. He would also get me in trouble so I can stay in so he can abuse me. I kept it a secret for years until one day it exploded at age 12 and when it exploded it made me an angry person in the inside. I ended up in a mental institution at age 15. We lived in a shelter and we were homeless. I came from a single family home — it was terrible. 

Also, all these years I kept my secret until 12 — my blood brother abused me in all ways except sexually which caused more anger in my life. My brother had tortureddd me and in 2015 — I stopped talking to him after he attacked him in front of his girlfriend. Then from 2015-2019 it was hell because he would create situations, steal and threaten me to get a reaction or find a reason to brutalize me. He would even invite people over to “embarrass” me because he knew was going to ignore him.

My blood brother turned his attention more over to my mom within those years because I stopped giving in, and it got to be too much last year for HER because he beat her and pulled a knife out on her. He chased us out the house with the knife and kicked my door down. He also threw my LSAT/Law School material in the trash and sewage. 

My step father and his son was out our lives at age 7 for me, yet I am still very angry. Also, If anything I hate my blood brother more. I wasn’t even the only person he abused — my brother abused male cousin my age (we are two years apart) sexually. I found out about it in 2010. 

To be honest, I believe my brother is gay and he abused me to cover it up. He deals with toxic masculinity. He would even call me a “dyke” in front of relatives which resulted in them bullying me for years and talking behind my back. I came to terms with myself regardless and even came out to my mom last year, so it doesn’t necessarily bother me that he thinks I am one. I just hate the fact that I feel that he is in the closet and he abused me to hide it. 

Also, I think he abused me because I know even dirtier vile things about him. He freaked out over an FBI child pornography warning on a computer as well when he was 19 — he claimed he accidentally stumbled on it. Overall, he acts just like Kevin from “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” only stupider. I see the real him and I know all his secrets - I still don’t think my mom even caught on. 

Now, after the arrest he didn’t get jail time just probation. I am bitter about this. He has a girlfriend with KIDS who he is lying to. He had enablers — his friend who insisted that we were crazy (my mom and I). He calls us “Black Bitches,” even though he is Black. He believes he is of Spanish-Hispanic (all his friends is). 

I just want him to pay for everything. I deal with anxiety. I had to see a shrink to not hurt him throughout those years I cut him off mentally. It was terror living under the same roof as him and torture seeing him abuse my mom next. I even tried to tell his friends about him — I wanted anyone to listen. I tried reaching out for help years ago to expose all my abusers and what they do, but mainly my brother. He just continues to lie and lie and use projections and insist that my mother and I are sick. 

Now, I just want to move on and uphold my restraining order on my blood brother for the rest of my life. I want to have a loving normal family. I want to forget everything. I don’t want to have anxiety attacks no more. I just want to move on. How do I not be angry about any of the abuse?",BlackOsmosis15,2020-03-27 22:52:19,6,797,41.14,61.37,52.2,1,16.27,11.92,92.97,58.97,23.71,19.45,11.17,1,0,6.9,0.38,4.27,4.39,14.93,5.77,6.02,6.9,1,13.68,3.76,1.88,1.13,2.26,1.63,7.28,0.63,6.65,0.63,4.52,0.13,16.19,3.51,0.63,1.13,9.03,9.28,2.01,1.76,1.76,1.13,1.51,1.76,1.25,0.63,0.13,0.38,3.14,1,1.13,1,0,9.03,4.14,0.63,3.01,0.63,1,5.14,7.78,0.38,15.06,2.38,7.15,5.65,0.75,0.25,0.75,0.13,0.13,0,0.5,0.38,0,0,0.13,0,12.05,5.9,2.38,0,0,0.25,0,0.5,1.25,0.63,1,0.13
fql74g,How Do I Help Guide for Independency?,"A friend, we'll call her M, left her boyfriend yesterday. It's not the first time its happened, but is my first time involved in the situation. Apparently he wanted her out of the house before the end of the day or he was going to beat her. For her safety, I decided to help her blitz move to her mom's, who had agreed and rented a Uhaul before I arrived.

M is financially dependent on the bf. She  states that he physically and verbally threatens her in front of her 3 yr old child who she has 50/50 custody with her ex. The bf however has not harmed the child although I dont know how true this is.Thankfully, her son is with his father this weekend. 

Apparently her bf is still sending her threatening text messages about money and degrading comments. She is quick tempered and I know she adds to the fuel when they argue. She is opposed to a restraining order and frankly, I'm afraid she's going to go back to him if we don't have a solid plan in place. I have repeatedy told her to stop talking to him and block him.

I think we did the most important part by removing her out of the house and somewhere safe for now. M and her mom don't have the best relationship, and the repeat cycle of returning to her abuser needs to stop. I have been a voice of reason to M and I need some guide to make sure M understands the severity of her situation so that this is not sabotaged.

I know she's going to need to put some kind of plan put together, but I don't know how to lay it out with her. With a mandatory state stay at home order, I think it's going to be difficult. Her reluctance to seek help will undermine the move and I think she thinks it's out of her control to help herself. In some ways, it's frustrating to me and I just want show her that it's all within grasp.

I need help with creating a general layout of getting her back to independency. How can I approach this? Also, are there certain ways of presenting ideas/words to her that would be helpful?",autoconfused,2020-03-28 07:30:04,0,389,42.35,85.99,7.46,30.09,17.68,14.65,91,57.33,20.82,16.2,4.88,0.77,0,10.28,0.26,4.37,5.66,14.14,9.77,4.63,6.43,1.8,18.77,2.57,1.03,1.8,1.29,1.8,5.4,2.83,2.57,1.03,1.29,0,19.02,1.03,1.29,9,3.34,13.11,3.34,2.57,2.06,2.57,1.29,2.31,0.77,0.26,0.26,0.26,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,11.31,4.37,1.8,4.63,1.03,2.06,3.08,13.62,2.06,14.14,3.6,4.88,5.91,0.26,0.26,1.03,0.77,0,0,1.03,0,0.77,0,0,0,12.85,5.14,3.08,0,0,0.77,0,0,0,3.34,0,0.51
fqpzt1,How convincing are they?,"We had another fight and he was still refusing to take responsibility for the most serious stuff. 

But of course, afterwards, he keeps hovering around me, checking on me, trying to reaffirm his ""love"" for me, trying to do things for me, trying to be on his best behavior. He's trying to rope me back in and I hate it. Let me breathe! Back off!!! Leave me alone!

Its just creepy how he's always keeping tabs on me and asking if I need anything or if there's anything I want him to do. If only he had been so eager to help this much when I really needed his help, instead of getting angry at me for asking. 

He tried apologizing last night. I just cried and wouldn't look at him or say anything. I wish he would have just let it go and walked away but he kept trying to apologize when I clearly wasn't in the mood to talk. He kept trying to get me to forgive him.

 I'm glad I didnt respond to him. He may be apologizing for things in general, but he keeps refusing to take responsibility for specific things. He's still justifying and denying and defending. 

Sorry, buddy, but you can't be that sorry or willing to change if you can't take full responsibility for everything. We're not playing this game on your terms anymore. You dont get to dismiss the most serious things but ""apologize"" for other things. 

He's really good at manipulation.

frjrcl,My parents are horrible,"My dad tried to kill me with a khurpi ( It's a kind of combat knife) today just because I requested him to not hang his infected clothes on my hanger. 

Haha, this is nothing new though, ever since my childhood my mother (who is a bitch and mentally unstable) used to cook up false complains and get my dad to beat me until I pissed. And after beating the shit outta me they would ask for forgiveness

I didn't want to spoil my karma and still forgave them. Every moment I spend with them I feel choked. They always ruin my dreams and try their level best to discourage me. They also love comparing me to others and belittle my accomplishments. They enjoy my failures. 

I've thought of running from home countless times and have contemplated sucide was too many times. But I don't want this life to go to waste. 

I tried my test to forgive them again and agian. But today I've had enough. NO MORE. 

I've had enough of this torture. I will work hard and develop myself physically, mentally and spiritually and become a better human. 

I will get independent and leave this so called home and never look back. I'll marry a good women and have lovely children, and I'll give them the love that I never got. And I'll make sure that my toxic parents are not apart of that life.

frmdie,tonight really showed me her true colors,"so my gf and have been having issues now for about 6 months and it all started when my mother died. the morning I found out my mom died I got up out of the bed crying and I told her what was going on. she ended up calling me a bitch and a pussy and to man up. she apologized after but that really broke me. so ever since then we’ve been arguing about a lot of nonsense ( her starting all of the arguments ) this past weekend it was her birthday and her dads back to back so I spent it with her and her family. supposedly she didn’t like what I said, which wasnt a big deal in my eyes and she made it this huge thing and when we got back to her home she came at me full charge and punched me and slapped me harder than i have ever been hit and kicked me out of the house. She ends up texting me saying that shes losing love for me and everything I do and say irritates her. i had no way to get home she lives 3 cities away from me. i was forced to sleep outside in the middle of a rainstorm. she opened the door in the morning and said i’m sorry and apologized and she didnt mean what she said. me being the forgiven person i am i accepted it. we spent all of today watching movies and just relaxing until she took me to work. ( i work overnights ) . on the way to work she wanted to talk about the other night and i said honestly i dont feel like arguing and going to work in a bad mood. that set her off. started calling me a piece of shit. a bum. an asshole. basically degrading me. all i said was why do you have to be such a bitch when i havent done anything. that infuriated her and she punched me in the face and broke my glasses. kicked me out of the car in the middle of the highway and basically followed me when i walked out the exit. she was fully speeding in her car and tried to hit me but i moved away and she only clipped my knee. she stopped and started laughing calling me a bum and pussy. basically egging me on to hit her. i was 2 hours late for work and i almost got fired and she went and told my sister what happened. she lied about everything made me the bad guy. i’m seriously considering filing a police report because she could have killed me and i have all of the texts she sent since then. i don’t know what to do because i love her so much and it pains me that she did this.",TheLastofFood,2020-03-30 00:30:09,1,481,23.69,50,67.36,2.91,16.03,11.23,95.84,64.03,24.95,19.75,11.43,0.62,0.21,7.48,0,5.2,6.03,12.89,7.28,6.44,9.77,1.46,19.33,2.29,1.25,2.29,0.62,1.66,6.44,1.87,4.37,0.21,1.87,1.04,15.38,1.04,0.42,8.11,0.62,8.52,1.46,1.66,0.42,0.83,2.08,2.08,3.12,0.83,1.66,0.62,2.7,1.66,0.42,0.42,0.21,7.69,1.87,1.46,2.7,1.04,0.83,11.64,6.24,1.04,16.63,2.08,7.9,7.28,1.66,0.83,1.25,0.42,0,0.62,1.46,1.25,0.21,0,0,0,8.32,6.03,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.25,0.83,0
fro174,Being quarantined after a rough break up is still better than being confined with the person who beat you up,"TW: Domestic abuse, violence

I am not going to lie, times are rough. Two weeks into quarantine, three weeks after I broke up with my ex and moved back to my parents house with most of my personal belongings broken by him. But at least I'm alive.

This one time though, I thought I was not going to make it. It was the day of the World Cup, we celebrated the football game and drank a bit. Then something changed in his eyes. He started to talk nonsense. Then he threatened me. I ran to my apartment and he followed me. He hit me once, broke a glass, and I managed to run up the stairs and lock myself inside my apartment. Then the nightmare began. He forced the door, choke me, threatened to rape me, hit me again. For hours I cried, yelled, I was out of breathe. I finally managed to run to the window and shout to my neighbours to call the Police, which they did. 
The Police came, and took him. The next morning they took my deposition, and he denied everything, which hurt a bit more. I was not emotionally ready to press charges, so I did not. I was in love, so I forgave him. But deep inside something was broken. I don't expect anybody to understand why I stayed with him after that. I don't understand it either. 

But now it's over for good, and almost two years later I can finally move on. i can tell myself: never again do I have to undergo such situation. Never again do I have to forgive such an act. Never again do I need to find excuses for someone who hurt me.

frvfig,MY MOM NEEDS HELP,"recently moly mom has gotten out of a relationship with a PSYCHO. She kicked him out and he keeps popping up at her house and beating up whoever is in the house. He always seems to be one step ahead of the cops because they can never catch him!! My mom called me crying this morning that he slashed all of her tires and shot at her best friend. He has also been going to my grandmas house to try to threaten her! The last time my mom called the cops, the cops took away her gun because apparently the psycho said SHE shot at HIM. She’s scared to death and doesn’t know what to do so she’s staying in a hotel. He even tried plugging up all the drains in her house and FLOODING IT. My mom can’t move out of state till the end of April. Does ANYONE know what to do until then. I fear that if he gets her when she’s alone he’ll KILL HER.

frwpsq,"How do I develop a good relationship with my previously abusive, differently-abled older brother now that I understand what my parents did to him?","I’m hoping there are other people out there with similar experiences that can help. I am the youngest of 4 and the only girl; it goes: oldest brother, Andy (6 years older), second brother, Mike (3 years older), third brother who is the subject of this post, Austin (2 years older) and me (27F). 

I’ve always been close with Andy and fairly close with Mike, but Austin and I had a horrible relationship growing up. I was told from a young age that Austin was born with unclassified learning disabilities, while the rest of us weren’t. Austin physically looked different - he had a larger forehead, a different shaped mouth and smaller eyes that didn’t track together - was slower to process information, and had a significant speech impediment (of which traces remain even after decades of speech therapy). He was bullied a lot when we were kids, and while I had lots of friends in the neighborhood, most of the kids didn’t want to pay with him.

He wasn’t very coordinated, but he was strong as an ox, so much so that even my older two brothers were scared of him. But he pretty much only ever went after me. The first incident I remember, I was 2 or 3. He got mad during a pillow fight and shoved my face into the sharp wooden frame of my bed. I had to get 6 stitches. He got a little smarter about it as we got older, but I often had to wear long sleeves, long pants and turtlenecks to cover up the cuts and bruises, and spent hours locked in our upstairs bathroom, because it was the only door that locked.

My parents avoided it as much as possible. They told me I wasn’t allowed to talk about the violence with other people, that it was a family matter. And they constantly reminded me it wasn’t his fault - he wasn’t in control of his anger, and it was pure luck that I hadn’t ended up that way.

I eventually stopped the abuse myself when I was teen. After he choked me until I almost blacked out, I realized he meant it when he told me he was going to kill me, and I began training in the middle of the night - using my dad’s weights to weight lift, running laps around our yard, doing push-ups and sit ups. At the same time, Austin, who had always been somewhat fat, went through an anorexic phase. I got stronger than him and put an end to it. I left for college as soon as I could and have been independent ever since.

Over the years, I stopped hating Austin. I understood his life had been hard, and when we were in our early twenties, he finally got himself help (our parents had never let him see a psychiatrist because they thought only weak people couldn’t handle their own mental health problems) and tried to make amends. I forgave him, but we have never been close, though he has tried. Recently I discovered he never had “unclassified learning disabilities.” He has fetal alcohol syndrome. My parents drank heavily while mom was pregnant with him. It wasn’t an act of chance or God - they did this to him, and while me and my oldest brothers are all successful, he has floundered his whole life for something that was their fault.

It gives me a new perspective, and while I’ll never forget what happened as a kid, I do believe he’s changed and doing his best, and he deserves to have family. But it’s hard for me and I have no idea how to develop a relationship after everything that happened. Any advise is welcome.

tldr I was physically abused for years by my older brother that I was told had learning disabilities. He changed, but I’ve never been able to develop a good relationship with him, despite his efforts. Recently found out he has FAS, which likely contributed to his behavior, and I want to provide him with better family support.

fs50rs,During this crisis I have become desperate. Please help.,"I  am unsure if this is regarded as narcissism or NPD so please enlighten  me. This lockdown and global criss has been making the situation considerably worse.

I have an elder sibling (31/M) with the following qualities:

\-  Does not listen to family. During this global crisis he still has been  going out. He still lives at home with the family and my father is  immunocompromised - my father is diabetic. Considering I am sure he does  not have friends, and my country is practically in lockdown, I bet he  is probably paying someone to fuck him since he is such a shrimp himself  HAHAHA. He also treats coworkers better than my family (by treat better  I mean something as simple as speaking nicer). He looks down on my  family who have raised him and provide a roof over his head.

\-  Does not wash his hands with soap. In fact, my family has to remind  him, and when they do he starts whinging and muttering under his breath.  I painstakenly have been required to follow him around the house to  sanitise everything he touches. I do not trust him and will not give him  the benefit of the doubt. He wants to order UberEats and I am suffering  an anxiety attack because I know as a fact he will not wash his hands  before and after eating and handling the box.

\-  He always has this disgusting scowl on his face which is very  uninviting and foul to look at. It triggers something in my brain.

\-  My mother drives him to the train station because he does not have his  own car. He always takes his time getting ready and my mother gets mad  because she too has to go to work, but he mutters and whinges for her to  shut up. I feel sorry for her. She is an essential worker.

\-  Whenever he goes out shopping he has to take the car (my parents car).  He never comes home with essentials or anything to help around the  house. He brings home snacks for himself.

\-  He does not clean up after himself. Heck, he doesn't know how to use an  iron, the vaccuum, or do anything remotely useful around the house.  Everyone else cleans up after him. Yet he recently just bought an  apartment HAHAHAH (he can't move out anytime soon because tenants to the  previous homeowner are still there or something and settlement isnt  finalised. IDK. I am so angry that this will be for another what.... six months?????????? I want him to fuck off already, so hearing that made me  depressed).

\- He is  psychologically abusive. I suffer from childhood and adult trauma  because of him, and have severe anxiety and low self esteem as a result.  Example: when music was played on TV, he would slam doors or mutter  under his breath to hint at you to turn off the TV or change the  channel. Whenever I felt happy about something and he was within earshot  he would pull this face or mutter, so I felt bad for feeling happy. I  still do. I have depression and can feel my entire mood and demeanor  change when I sense his presence. Now as an adult my patience is  borderline nonexistent. I get explosive and shout when he does not  follow orders. Because of his behaviour and this crisis, I have daily  anxiety and a couple times per month I punch myself in the head to  release tension. I had to start going to therapy because of him, but due  to this global crisis, I can't go anymore. And have to live with him?? I  am suicidal and have had thoughts for over a year now.

\- I have no doubt that when my parents are elderly, he will not take care of them.

\-  When I was younger and was more social, I always felt uncomfortable  with friends coming over because of his uninviting appearance and  demeanor. I am still uncomfrotable when my boyfriend comes over. On this  note, Steven never says hello. MY wonderful boyfriend does even when I  tell him to not bother.

My  parents tell me to be civil with him, otherwise he will keep going out  during this time and cause more problems for the family. MY FAMILY HAS  TO COMPROMISE FOR HIM.

I  daydream of choking Steven to death or him being pushed to being  suicidal. I envision him accidentally falling down the stairs and me  seeing him at the bottom, and instead of helping, just go back into my  room and pretend I didnt hear or see a thing.  I want to be the one to  push him to being suicidal. I want him to feel the psychological and  physical pain I have suffered for years. I want him to know he is a  black sheep and unloved, let alone liked. I want him to feel unwanted. I  want him dead. I have so much hate that I do not consider him family. I  am ashamed and disappointed of him. At times I have reconsidered  marriage because of the whole merging of families thing, and I am  ashamed of him. But for the sake of making this thread, I have to point  out that he genetically is lol. Coping mechanisms for anxiety that I  learnt from therapy arent working during this time because I have to  worry about the behaviour of someone else which can not be fixed. My  parent are going to suffer. I may lose one this year. I now play videos  extremely loudly to sound out my thoughts.

I  am grateful I have parents who love and appreciate my effort in making  my home santitary and safe. I am grateful I have a longterm boyfriend  who understands and roots for my happiness. When Steven is away from my  family, I will feel calm. I feel happy. I feel safe.",t_haee,2020-03-30 19:52:54,0,984,27.39,43.94,46.18,11.35,13.86,16.46,92.58,60.47,20.93,16.77,8.74,0,0.1,7.72,0.2,4.17,3.96,13.41,9.86,4.88,8.74,2.34,19,3.86,2.03,1.83,0.41,0.71,7.52,3.15,4.27,1.32,0.81,1.12,13.41,2.13,0.51,0.61,7.83,12.91,2.74,2.34,1.22,2.74,1.32,3.66,3.25,0.71,0.91,1.52,2.54,0.91,1.12,0.2,0.2,7.83,2.85,0.71,2.44,1.02,1.52,2.13,14.84,1.42,14.23,2.95,5.39,5.89,1.02,1.83,2.13,0.41,0,0.51,0.71,0.3,0.41,0,0,0.1,14.43,7.32,2.54,0.2,0,1.22,0,1.02,0,0.3,0.81,1.02
fsa939,Have had enough,"Hi
I'm sorry I'm posting from a throwaway but I need privacy.
Today I feel like I lost it. It was just too much. I've being struggling with my mental disorders for a long time, today I was so distraught.
I have thoughts and obsession that are important but cause me to become suicidally depressed.
As an adult I am still living with my parents, I've got no job (on and off with job agencies), uni has been similar.
Then these things happen.
It happens randomly, sometimes three times a week, sometimes once a fortnight, you never know.
All my energy is put into my obsessions and problems.

My parents stormed into my room angry that I had used the spare bedroom and created a mess. I get it- my room and the spare bedroom is a mess. I can only say it's related to a lot of my phobias and it's a work in progress.
There was a lot of verbal and psychological abuse from both parents. A lifetime of it..and I snapped. I stood up for myself, told my dad to treat me like a daughter for once in his life.

I told my mum about my suicide attempts and struggle to get through the mental health system. She couldn't care less.
What she did have the energy for though was to go into room and verbally harass me repeatedly, while im on the phone with a counsellor.

All I wanted tonight was to nurse my cold and watch a 20 min episode of an anime. I haven't even been able to even finish the episode.
My dad mocked my cold. Last night I had to rescue the neighbour's cat from the tree outside my room, risking bites and scratches coz he can get aggressive. Anyway I very reluctantly enlisted by parents' help bc I couldn't help the cat on my own. You're perfectly fine, he says, otherwise you wouldn't have rescued the cat last night.
I am so done.
Iam emotionally broken. My mental illnesses aren't my worst enemy. *They* are.

What kind of sick psychos care more about orderliness and housekeeping than a person's life?
I would have left eons ago, but I'm not financially independent and my thoughts keep me here. ( Can get real delusional in there)

Sorry for this long post, but I just need some solidarity. Whenever these events happen I feel so devastated. Should I just say **** it and make a solid plan to get out once lockdown stops?
I really have felt hopeless tonight and I don't want to feel this way one more time.",throwaway24665,2020-03-31 03:00:51,7,437,35.06,19.23,79.1,1,12.49,17.16,90.85,54.69,18.31,14.42,12.36,0,0.69,1.14,0.23,3.89,6.18,10.76,10.76,5.03,7.09,2.06,18.54,4.35,2.06,0.69,1.37,2.29,7.78,2.06,5.72,1.83,1.37,1.37,7.55,1.83,0.23,0.92,1.14,10.98,2.06,1.6,2.29,1.6,0.92,2.52,2.75,0.23,0.92,1.6,1.83,0,1.83,0,0,6.86,1.6,1.6,1.6,1.6,1.14,5.49,12.81,0.92,12.36,0.46,5.26,6.41,1.6,0,1.6,0.23,0,0.46,0.69,0,0.46,0,0,0.23,17.62,7.78,2.97,0,0,0.46,0,0.23,0,3.89,0.92,1.37
fsb39b,I hate myself.,"Hello, a couple of months ago my husband got violent with me, it was the third time but this time he really hurt me. I did call the cops and they arrested him, i came to my parents house and he got bailed out that same day. He gave me a whole story on how sorry he was on how being in jail made him realize that he messed up and blah blah blah. Well, I fell for it. A Criminal Protective Order was issued for 3 years, he must not harass me, take or break property, etc. Well, he did he would call me names, worthless, useless, bitch, a child(hes 12 years older than me), pathetic, idiot, etc. Well the incident happened in September and i found out I was pregnant in November. I went to Mexico for almost a month thinking maybe we just needed a break, well i came back and for a week he was nice. I thought wow okay stuff is changing and we will finally be happy. Well, I was wrong. His words started to get worse, his insults, he even raped me again while i kept saying my stomach was hurting(hes forced himself on me multiple times). Thats when I said enough. I packed my things and my daughters and waiting for him to leave so I can have my parents pick me up. If i called my parents when he was there it wouldve gotten ugly and my dad would've problem ended up in jail. Well, when I left he was harassing me non stop, if i didn't pick up he would leave voicemails calling me names, him raising his voice, calling me a child, ""suggesting"" i call him back and that I will never get rid of him, that he will always be in my life. He even threatened to take me to court for custody if i ""didnt act right"", which by that he means me disobey him. When I would start to stand up for my self he would say I'm a cocky bitch or a smart mouth bitch that he loved the old me, the one that wouldn't respond back and just took everything. I'm scared he will get custody and do something to the baby just to get back at me. He does has a temper and he actually lost custody of his other children but I'm scared the judge will think he's ""changed"" and he'll want to give him a chance since its a new kid.

fscjer,Just a vent.,"He stabbed me multiple times tonight and my mattress is covered in my own blood. Chunks of my hair is ripped out, in the entrance of the bedroom doorway. It feels like a fur carpet. My glasses are broken again and I'm basically back to being fucking blind, so I wouldn't be able to clean it up anyways. My body is battered beyond belief from multiple punches and especially my head. My lips are swollen and cracked, as well as the inside of my mouth sliced open in multiple places, from my teeth, from when he was trying to snap my neck. Or suffocate me, can't remember. I figured out I could breathe through my nose. Pretended to black out, so he'd feel powerful. I can still taste the metallic blood. I was going to kill myself. No matter how hard I apologized, I was ravaged with the worst verbal spewage he could muster, each a uniquely designed bullet to my self-esteem. Honestly, I took the knife he stabbed me with and sliced it across my body, but he stole it from me and rewarded me with a blow, hard to the side of the head. I was paralyzed for a second. The stupid, sick thing is that I almost thought he cared for a second, by the way he pulled it out of my hand. He doesn't. I know. Afterwards, I sat next to him, as he tore me apart. Quiet as a church mouse. Absorbing his words, like a sponge drenched in water. No matter how ridiculous and horrible, I hae learned to keep my fucking mouth shut. It's just a game. I actually rested my head on him and held his hand, during it. The only comfort I will get out of him, it will only ever be physical. I feel like I am watching myself from outside of my body, when he attacks me sometimes. I see myself turn into this weak, malleable creature. I don't even know what the fuck I am doing when this is happening, I just fulfill the demand my brain tells my body to do. I'm pathetic and desperate. I start peeling an orange in the middle of my hysteria and offer it to him, because the bag of fruit is all over the ground. I try anything for it to stop. What the fuck? Seriously, an orange? Anyways. I decided at 6:00 AM, I should probably get some sleep. So, I went into the other room to lay down, my heart still hammering inside of my chest. I fucking swore if it didn't stop, I'd have to go into the ambulance. My back and jaw started hurting and it felt like I was having a heart attack. It didn't matter, though. Because he threw up in the other room, on the couch, entirely inebriated. I know he expected me to clean him up, so I did.

fsexzx,Need to get this off my chest,"Hi guys, I'm a first-time poster but lately been having trouble dealing with old/new issues in regards to my family and would appreciate a little TLC and advice (Please don't be fooled by my username)

Please be warned there is mention of drugs.

I'm a 22F and as of late (the last year or so) I've been really trying to heal and seek help in regards to my mental health. I've had trouble with my mental health for as long as I can remember and last year everything really hit me in the face and I decided I wanted to be better and that I deserve better.

Background (It's a long one sorry): I was born as a heroin dependable baby, meaning that I had to stay in the ICU for about 6 weeks or so, so the nurses could ""ween"" me off the drug. Ngl when my mum told me that (Only a few months ago) it broke my heart. My Grandparents had to give her money to support that habit to keep me alive. 

My Dad had passed away about 7-8 months before my birth from an overdose and then my mum meets my step-dad 8 months after having me so essentially I've viewed him as a dad and even called him dad. 

When I was young, myself and my 2 older siblings were court-ordered to be taken out of our mum's care and placed with a relative but we still were allowed to visit her on the weekends. I honestly lived for those weekends because I loved my mum so much and wanted to be with her. But then I ended up dreading them.

For a while, it would be me and my older brother going to visit her and then it just became me. My mother has suffered a lot, losing her soul-mate and then her kids and also struggling with her addiction and suffering from depression. I'm always on her side and try to be there for her.

My step-dad would consistently abuse, verbally and physically, my mum every time I came to visit and I heard everything and then he'd turn around and say it was my fault because I was sooking for my mum and that made him angry. Now that I'm older I understand he was just jealous that I was taking her attention.

I would hear her screams and him talking and telling her to shut up. I remember this one time, I couldn't have been older than 7, but I was following my mum back to her room and I was a few steps behind her. He was lying on the bed and as soon as she walked through the door he jumped and slammed the door in my face and she started to scream and asking for help and I ran back to my room. Another time she was off her face from methadone and she was eating a toast with peanut butter. It stuck to the side of her face and he was laughing and was telling me to go grab the camera and take photos so he could show it to her later. Every time she was off her face it would freak me out and scare me and I didn't want to be around her but I couldn't say no to him and did as he said.

I was exposed to this until I stopped visiting for weekends (I honestly couldn't tell you the age but it was somewhere around the start of high school) During high school my mum and step-dad decided to move 6 hours away but they were closer to my grandparent and my mums family. Should also say that my mum has 4 boys to him as well and every time she has said she was leaving him he would say 'You'll never see the boys again' and other sentences along that line.

There's only been 2 other times where I've heard him abuse her. 1st time was when I went to visit (I was about 19 or 20) and stayed in my little brother's room which was next to theirs and I woke up in the middle of the night to sobs and screams and the sound of him chocking her. Him saying to 'Keep crying and I'll give you something to cry about' I laid here frozen and crying and shaking not knowing what to do. I had my phone in my hand but was too scared to call the police. Eventually, it stopped and it took a while to fall asleep. 2nd time I again slept over in my brother's room and again was woken up by him abusing her but this time I was mad and angry and scared I got up went into the kitchen to grab a knife but then thought what the hell could I do? He could charge me for assault but honestly, at that moment I wanted to hurt him so badly. I kept my light on and the door opened a bit and heard him leave their bedroom and then said back to my mum 'You woke up Only\_Insults\_Pls' my mum asked how did he know, he said 'The fat C's lights are on' I pack my stuff and left and stayed at my grandparents. Since then I've never stayed over and I constantly feel guilty like what if I stayed and confronted him? Why can't I protect my mum?

To the most recent events, my little brother who is 15 calls me up saying my step-dad was picked up and taken to jail (for domestic violence) while our mum was off her face on pills and trashing the house. As soon as I heard him I knew he wasn't okay and he told me he was tired and asked if I could give him money for the bus to leave. I told him I was coming to get him and I'd see him soon. From where I live now and to where they live its a 7-hour drive but I didn't care I needed to get my brothers.

Halfway there my brother calls me and says my step-dad has made bail and needed a lift back home. I was reluctant but also knew he wouldn't let it go if I said no. So I picked him up and the whole time he was saying how the charge was for something was back in Jan and that mum has been trying to retract her statement but she can't because she's with the police as they're a witness. From what it sounded like he was trying to convince me that she made the whole thing up and my mums crazy.

My mum is a shell of who she was, which wasn't much. Even when she was off her face on pills her house was always clean. She has contradicted her self to me saying how she couldn't take it anymore and hope that the COVID-19 virus takes her to get out of the hell she is in and then she'll turn around saying she wouldn't take her life because she's strong (and she is) but he is such a parasite that I can see she's barely hanging on.

I don't know what to do at this point, I've given her resources and numbers to call to get out. I've told her every chance I can to leave him, take the boys and go but I'm met with half-hearted 'yeah'. I'm tired and I know I've done all I can but she calls me up telling me all the stuff he's done and how much she can't be around him and why won't he leave when he doesn't love her. I understand it's hard to get out of abuse like this when it's not only physical, verbal and mental but also with drug abuse too but at this point, I feel like the only way she'd be able to get out is if he ends up killing her or she kills herself. I don't want it to end like that because deep down I'm still that little girl who wants her mum to be happy and healthy and with me. I don't want to lose her too. I'm worried about my brothers and them growing up in the environment. My step-dad hasn't raised a had to them but is verbally and emotionally abusive to the 15-year-old, I want to get them out. I was even thinking of fostering them myself self but I don't have the financial means to do so and I want to give them everything.

This is causing me emotional and mental stress. As soon as I came home I stayed in my room and didn't eat for 24hrs or more because I just couldn't move I was pretty my frozen. Which is what a therapist has said that I do, I don't fly or flee I freeze.

Sorry for the long post.

fshuvq,"This time, I hit him back","This might make some people angry but it happened. I don’t consider myself an abuser though I’m sure some people will say I am. Which I understand. 


My post history has almost no history of what I’ve been going through because I’ve been deleting most of my posts in this sub after a while, for privacy reasons. 


Here’s what happened. It was last week:

My abusive husband’s violence has been escalating over the past year. He was violent before, but this past year he has become merciless. Late February especially, he beat me like never before and since our home belongs to his family, he has been threatening to divorce me (which I would be fine with if I had money) and to kick me out legally. I don’t have a job and each time he made his threats I froze with fear. 


A week ago, we argued, he strangled me (as usual now), and he made the most convincing threat of eviction. He told me I had until the end of April to get out. He was riling me up on purpose and scaring me. I was feeling helpless.


It wasn’t even 7am yet and we had just woke up. After he strangled me, I was on the couch and he was standing but was bent over to have his face close to mine while telling I had a little over 30 days to get out. He sounded dead serious about kicking me out and I couldn’t take it anymore. I thought about grabbing his hair but I didn’t want to use violence, because I felt it was useless, and I was fairly sure he would beat the hell out of me again if I tried. He is twice my size, and I was scared. However he continued telling me I’d be homeless, so without thinking, in a swift motion, I suddenly grabbed his hair, pulled him down and punched his face and his back several times. 


He has been beating me so much that, unfortunately for him, I now know most of his motions and expected them without thinking, which rendered his attempts at attacking me useless. 


I don’t remember what happened because this was pretty out of character for me, so I went back to watch the security footage and apparently I said several time “you’re going to stop strangling me” and “you’re going to stop trying to make me homeless” and also “I’m a goddamn person”. I usually say the latter when I feel most dehumanized by his violence.


After a couple minutes I let him go. We argued for another thirty seconds and then he went to the bedroom. He came back crying, but it wasn’t a cry of physical pain or the upset cry from the argument. It was the same cry I cry after he beats me. A desperate cry after having been so hurt in your pride, in your heart and in your humanity.


I immediately felt like all my anger was gone. I felt vindicated, but I also knew that I didn’t want to treat anyone like this, much less someone I used to love so much. 


He was still crying and talking and I tried to justify my actions for a couple of minutes, but then I realized it was stupid. I stopped and I apologized. I saw his eye starting to bruise and gave him an ice pack. He was like “don’t touch me” and asked me to leave him alone, so I did. 


I apologized that morning but also in the afternoon and told him I didn’t want that to happen anymore. I said I wanted to make peace, which he accepted. The cohabitation has been peaceful since. He’s been more patient and nice and I’ve been too. 


Now I can’t help but think he’s nicer because he got a taste of his own medicine. I also know the peace might not last and he might come back with a vengeance, so I’m careful. 


I had to go out several times with bruises on my body and on my face after his beatings, but he’s been refusing to be seen outside the house because of his black eye. Good thing we are in quarantine, but still. He won’t even FaceTime anyone. I told him “I went out many times with bruises you gave me”. He said “that shouldn’t have happened” and instead of blaming me for physically abusing me, he finally took most of the blame and told me he did way way worse to me than I did to him, so he deserved what I did to him, which I disagreed with. No one deserves violence. 


I felt calmer after hitting him for less than a couple minutes, and I feel so awful for doing that despite the fact that it was once and I did it to someone who has been abusing me for a long time, yet he didn’t hesitate to beat me mercilessly up to three times a day just last month. 


Also want to add that I hate this awful thing has made me feel more powerful and gave me back some of my confidence, but as a matter of fact, it did.


I am unable to leave at the moment because of financial situation and also some other personal things, but I’m guessing that’s how people who can finally get out feel. Empowered. Probably a thousand times more confident than I’m feeling right now.",heartbreakhostel,2020-03-31 11:05:40,11,918,16.4,33.93,75.62,1,18,16.23,95.1,62.85,24.29,18.95,11.33,0.54,0.65,6.32,0.11,5.34,4.03,13.07,10.57,5.77,8.93,2.18,21.46,4.79,3.49,1.42,0.76,3.05,7.41,1.96,5.34,0.98,2.18,1.31,12.09,0.33,0,0,6.43,13.29,2.83,2.18,1.31,3.05,0.98,3.7,3.16,0.65,0.65,1.74,1.42,0.76,0.44,0,0.11,6.32,1.09,1.31,3.05,1.09,1.09,9.69,8.5,1.2,14.92,1.85,4.68,8.93,0.33,0.11,0.54,0.22,0.11,0.11,0.22,0.22,0,0,0,0,14.81,5.45,4.14,0.11,0,0,0,0,1.31,3.38,0.44,0

My neighbor (down the road, just met today) just came to me and told me the people living in the 2nd home on her property are robbing her, destroying property, threatening her and her children.  
Her husband, now deceased, was slowly losing his mind and invited these people to live in their second home last year, and now they've invited more people.  She suspects drugs are involved since they apparently only come out at night.  There is no legal contract. 
She called cops after an incident with a firearm but they hid it when the cops came.  She could not make it clear why, but the police told her she needed to give them 30 days notice before they have to leave.  That is in early April, and she fears they won't leave after that considering the current pandemic had closed many departments that would deal with something like this. I told her to get security cameras to film the theft but after that I'm not sure what to tell her to do.  She is scared for her life.  Additionally, she will not break the law in any way under any circumstances even if it would mean getting these people off her property.  Religious reasons.

fsrd59,COVID-19 RESOURCES FOR ABUSE VICTIMS,"We know many of you are struggling to manage with already traumatic events and now are dealing with a global pandemic of COVID-19. Many of you may be quarantined with an abuser or dealing with their ramped up abuse due to their proximity or need for that outlet. Abusers are coming back from years ago to get to you with hoovers. Being isolated is very hard and this is a situation completely unexpected and anxiety driving in and of itself. So we wanted to put together a listing of resources, many of which are listed in our resource listing in the sidebar for you in this difficult time. Stay safe out there, folks. We are right here with you, and we will get through this together. 


Support for Domestic Abuse:

* [Thehotline.org]( https://www.thehotline.org/) is available 24/7 for chat and calls (1800-787-3224) during this crisis for women, men as well as LGBTQ folks. Please be sure to use safe electronics to contact them or any agency if an abuser has access to them. They also offer a [Safety Planning]( https://www.loveisrespect.org/for-yourself/safety-planning/interactive-safety-plan/) through [LOVEISRESPECT]( https://www.loveisrespect.org/) which is also available 24/7. 


* [RAINN]( https://www.rainn.org/) is still operating their crisis lines 24/7 along with chat capabilities. They can be there for sexual assault victims. 

* [1in6]( https://1in6.org/) is a resource for men who have been abused/sexually assaulted. They are available right now with weekly support group online meetings in addition to a 24/7 chat line. They work with [RAINN]( https://www.rainn.org/) for a resource just for men. 

* [SurvivorsUK]( https://www.survivorsuk.org/) is there for male rape and sexual abuse victims 12PM-8PM in the UK. 

* [CODA]( https://coda.org/) runs online support groups for people struggling with Codependency. They have physical meetings in many places in normal times, but have a number of online support groups for those needs. 

* [HOTPEACH]( https://hotpeachpages.net/) is a site where they direct you to services for domestic abuse internationally. It’s a great resource for non-US resources. 

* [DomesticShelters]( https://www.domesticshelters.org/) is a resource to help you locate shelters and resources. They also have online support groups. 

* [FAMILY SANCTUARY]( https://sanctuaryforfamilies.org/safety-planning-covid19/) offers safety planning direction and support. 

* [REDROVER]( https://redrover.org/news/coronavirus-covid19/) helps with safety planning for your pets and resources. 

* [LGBT Foundation]( https://www.lgbt.foundation/how-we-can-help-you/domestic-abuse) is still working to provide you with services during this stressful time to the LGBTQ community.

Resources For Suicide Hotlines (Please dial emergency services if you are a threat to your safety):

* [SUICIDEWATCH](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=NarcissisticAbuse&amp;utm_content=t5_2ys1m) is the sub at Reddit that has the listings of suicide hotlines and organizations there to help you in your time of need. It’s a vast listing with an FAQ. Please reach out. 

* [US Suicide Hotline Directory]( http://suicidehotlines.com/national.html) for those of you in the USA.

* [International Suicide Hotline Directory]( http://suicidehotlines.com/international.html) for crisis lines internationally. 

Therapy Options:
 
* [WEAREHEARTED]( https://www.wearehearted.com/) is offering video calls for help and support during this time of isolation and social distancing.     

* Many therapists in your local area are offering their services through [TELEMEDICINE]( https://www.goodrx.com/blog/what-is-telemedicine/) so that you can have sessions online through ZOOM/SKYPE/FACETIME. They will then also be in the area for you to use in person when the pandemic ends allowing you to have consistency and develop an effective relationship. Please still know you want to find one with experience treating victims of abuse. 

* [AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OVERVIEW]( https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/online-therapy ) for the AMA discussion on how online therapy works and how to select a service for yourself. 

* [ONLINE THERAPY SERVICES]( https://www.verywellmind.com/best-online-therapy-4691206) and [ONLINE THERAPY SERVICES]( https://www.e-counseling.com/online-therapy/)  gives a overview of various companies (we do not endorse their ratings and do not know if they are sponsored) as well as [TALKSPACE]( https://www.talkspace.com/) and [BETTERHELP]( https://www.betterhelp.com/online-counseling/)  but again, we do not endorse any one company.

fss05s,Assault and Harrassment,"Alabama, USA

Basically, my room mate assaulted me in my sleep and when I woke up he began choking me. This was in response to me telling him and his guests to be quiet after they had woken me up the night before. While he was choking me, he made reference to a murder his brother committed last year, saying that he was going to ""throw me in a well."" After that, he moved out, but during the move out process, he would show up at odd hours with guests and when I'd come back nothing would be moved from where I last saw it. He would also be there waiting for me to return from work, at which point I just waited in the apartment parking lot until he would leave (around midnight). On one of these visits, he took the lock off of my door making it impossible to lock him out. I told my landlord the next day, and the locks were changed immediately. But on that night, I lived in fear.

This happened about a month ago, and we are both 20 year old men. He is starting to contact my family saying that I owe him $700 for bills that are entirely in his name. If the harrassment continues I might have to take some action and get a restraing order.

What can I do to press charges? I have a much more detailed account of the assault and harrassment that I hand wrote after he stole my deadbolt lock. I also have a witness to the assault, and he had a guest with him when he stole my lock.",thegrantland100,2020-03-31 20:46:08,5,278,50.25,59.95,69.74,6.07,18.53,13.31,92.81,60.79,21.94,17.27,9.35,0.36,0,7.19,0.36,4.68,5.76,15.83,8.27,5.04,6.83,0.36,18.71,2.88,1.8,2.16,1.08,2.16,2.52,0.36,2.16,0.36,1.8,0,12.95,0.72,1.8,0,7.91,7.19,0.36,1.44,2.52,1.44,1.08,1.08,2.52,0.72,1.08,0.72,1.8,0.72,1.08,0,0,6.83,1.44,0.36,3.24,1.8,0,8.27,7.19,0.72,23.02,3.6,8.63,10.79,0.72,0.36,1.8,1.08,0,0.36,0.36,0,0,0,0.36,0,11.87,4.68,4.68,0,0,0.36,0,0,0.72,0.36,0.72,0.36
fsto4q,roommate's BF is abusive,"so first of all, I'm asking for advice for a friend, I'm not the one in the situation and I have really limited info. 

a few months ago, my friend (D) was living with me and moved out. we had a bit of a falling out and have had limited contact since then. she texted me recently to ask for resources / advice on her new living situation. apparently her new roommate (S) has an on-again, off-again, abusive boyfriend (T). the boyfriend threatens to kill himself if S stops talking to him, destroys her things, and at one point held a gun to her head. D has expressed her concerns and tried to set boundaries with S, and S has acted like D is crazy for being concerned. T has been in their home for a couple days and D can't get an answer on when he is leaving. (I'm kinda wondering if T is trying to sneakily move in, like pretend he's quarantining with them and just never leave.) 

I can't offer for D to come live with me. I gave her contact info on how to get free therapy from a trauma-informed therapist, but I don't know if she will reach out to them. anyone know of resources I can give her on how to best handle this? I don't know if moving out is a viable financial option right now.",throwaway7248916,2020-03-31 22:43:28,2,239,64.1,67.72,60.49,4.52,17.07,14.23,89.96,56.49,13.81,12.55,5.44,0.42,0,5.44,1.26,1.26,5.44,17.15,10.04,4.6,7.53,2.51,20.08,2.93,1.67,1.26,1.26,1.67,4.18,0.84,2.93,0.42,2.09,0,15.9,0,3.77,3.77,2.93,11.72,3.77,1.26,1.67,4.18,0.84,3.77,0,0,0,0,2.93,0.42,2.09,0,0.42,8.37,3.77,2.51,1.26,1.26,0.84,4.6,13.39,0.84,16.74,2.93,7.53,6.28,1.26,0.42,1.26,0.84,0,0.42,0.84,0,0.84,0,0,0,18.41,5.02,4.18,0,0,0.42,0,1.26,0,3.77,3.35,0.42

ft0x8z,I think it took getting really sick for me to finally reach the point where I will leave,"I kind of hated him this week when he wouldn't bring me water or say something encouraging. I think I counted twelve times when he either wished me dead or made a comment about the morgue. I felt pretty angry but I also didn't have the energy to do much more than fall back asleep. 

I started to feel better these last couple of days though. I wake up for 3 - 4 hrs now. I figured that I had 9 days of TV to catch up on so I turned it on and got about 2 min in. Then some cars started honking and I mentioned to him that I had read that it was a new way of protesting. (I read online that in this country they are doing that today because small businesses are suffering.)

Anyway, he wished me dead again and my initial thought was to tell him that I'd go to sleep and never wake up and then I had this thought that I genuinely don't like him and won't give him the satisfaction. 

There's nothing that I can do or say, but I feel like these last few days may have finally gotten me to wake up. It is ingrained in me to forgive, marriages are performed before God, yada yada. I can't stop believing but I feel like I'm ready to commit that sin and just GTF away. I had a preacher tell me once that God wants you to be a good wife but he doesn't want you to be a doormat. 

That means you don't have to be hit and hurt. Maybe it's a sin to leave, maybe it's not. Maybe you're a bad spouse, maybe not. I have no clue, but I think the one positive thing to come out of this week is just deciding that I don't like this. I can buy myself a small place somewhere and no longer be told to die.",PenguinPlates,2020-04-01 07:35:59,0,342,11.56,14.62,97.16,36.02,18,10.82,95.91,61.7,23.1,14.91,10.82,0,1.17,2.63,0.29,7.89,3.8,11.4,11.4,7.02,7.31,4.09,22.81,4.09,2.34,0.88,2.05,1.75,5.85,3.22,2.63,0,0.88,0.58,7.89,0.88,0,0.29,2.63,15.5,4.68,0.58,1.46,3.8,1.17,4.68,2.05,0,0.58,1.46,2.05,1.46,0.29,0,0.29,6.14,1.17,0.29,2.34,2.05,0.58,5.56,14.62,1.75,16.37,2.34,6.43,7.89,1.17,0.29,0.29,0.58,1.46,1.17,0.29,0,0,0,0,0.29,12.87,5.26,2.05,0,0,0,0,0.29,0,4.68,0.58,0

ftcjqs,I'm a Trauma therapist who makes videos to help others,"Hello DomesticViolence Subreddit,

I am a trauma therapist in California and I used to work solely with domestic violence victims. Due to the spike in Domestic Violence and the possibility of it getting worse due to the Coronavirus, I put out a video for those who may be unable to go to a friend's house, a shelter, or if calling the police is not an option. Being stuck inside in an abusive relationship is a worst nightmare scenario. I understand this is a unique situation we are facing and I hope this 7 minute video can help in anyway possible.

ftcxj6,"My dad in Asia is trying to commit suicide, again, guilt shaming my mom, again.","My dad has been separated recently due to the constant domestic violence over 20+ years. He went back to our homeland in Asia several months ago, where the COVID-19 Pandemic is still prevalent. He has struggled with decades of alcoholism since his early 20s, and now messages/contacts my mother (she's with me in the US) every day with abusive words now, while trying to intoxicate himself in this situation. He is very old, where his health will definitely be at risk if he continues his acute alcohol intoxication at this rate with COVID-19 going on. My dad knows that my mom has a soft spot when seeing him being weak, but this abusive relationship and self-detrimental behaviors should stop. I'm a college student, and throughout my life, he has broken his promises so many times -- he would never again yell, pour abusive words, break furniture, throw stuff at his family members, physically harm us, etc... -- that I just gave up on him, so I thought it would be better if I just run away to college, and him being separated from us to the other nation. Since I got kicked out of dorms due to the current pandemic, I am seeing more vividly than ever that my family is just so frustrating. After the years of an abusive relationship and finally making her mind to start the legal divorce process, my mom, after seeing my dad harming himself, is now weak again and begging me to forgive/get him back to the US/  call him etc. I can't. I still have zoom classes/assignments to finish this semester or whatever and need to make up/find alternatives to financially support my family since my campus job is also paused.

fte4p4,Feeling emotional about his release.,"So due to the virus they are releasing some people. My ex had 25 domestic related charges including pointing a firearm. So it was obviously a very serious matter and I didn’t think he would get that option. I am not willing to go to trial because it will put my safety at risk and the crown knows this. As of right now because of the situation I don’t think he is a threat to me because he is in the stage where he is trying to get me back by getting people to reach out to me for him, sending me love letters and cards in the mail etc. They called me and told me since I am not willing to go to trial if I was okay with them releasing him now because of the virus. I said yes. He’s supposed to get out tomorrow and now I’m feeling really emotional... It’s going to feel weird having him out in the world knowing he’s in the same town as me.

ftp52f,My wife filed a domestic violence case against me,"Long story short 

I found my wife sexting with other guys, I got really jealous and wanted her iphone with force. She’s taller and weighs more than I, so I had to use some force just to get the phone, but I never punched her or hit her. 

Then I wanted to get out the apartment and she blocked the exit and I had to get out trough the kitchen window.

I mas mean with her, I kicked her out of my apartment and she went to live with her sister for a week.

Now, we’re back together taking couples therapy and I accepted everything and just want to give us a second chance.

Last night I saw that she had already filed a domestic violence case against me for emotional and physical abuse.

She called the police department and they told us that there’s no way that the case can get dismissed, and that I would get arrested anytime soon.

I’m also gonna need a lawyer, I’m gonna have a misdemeanor. I’m so mad right now

Also, she’s from Venezuela and I’m a US citizen.

What should I do?",Smkthtsht,2020-04-02 09:15:03,0,199,23.3,54.02,37.54,2.85,18.09,14.07,92.46,58.29,23.12,19.6,11.06,2.01,0,6.03,0.5,3.52,6.53,10.05,7.54,7.04,9.05,1.01,20.6,3.52,1.51,0.5,0.5,1.01,3.52,0.5,3.02,0,1.51,0,14.57,1.51,0.5,7.54,0.5,12.06,1.51,1.51,3.02,2.01,1.01,3.52,1.01,0.5,0.5,0,3.02,0,1.51,0.5,1.01,10.05,4.52,0,2.01,3.52,0,7.04,12.56,2.01,12.06,1.51,5.53,5.53,1.51,0,3.02,0,0,0,1.01,0,1.01,0,0,0,13.07,4.52,4.02,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,4.02,0,0

fty8fw,"If you've ever been a victim of Narcissistic Abuse, I am desperately asking for your help...","Back in September, having changed schools, I met a girl that I'd only heard her name being passed around a few times in the past back then. Now, we are a small community here so basically every time two highschool kids form a relationship the word travels around really fast. And so did the story of my new friend and I knew about her boyfriend way before I met her. Everything I heard concerning him from my close friends gave the impression that he is a cool, calm and cheerful guy, someone you would wanna be friends with. He supposedly had a loving and wholesome relationship with her during summer of 2019, however, they had already been broken up for about a month before I got to meet her.

I got really close to her in no time, of course I would... She is such a kind and loving person, her empathy levels are up through the roof. As we got closer she slowly started opening about the past, and, of course, us being teenagers, we discussed about her relationship with that boy I mentioned earlier. They broke up because they had been having frequent fights for stupid teenagers' stuff. As it turned out though, she was unhappy with this and somehow they both got convinced on retrying their relationship, so they were in the ""getting back together"" phase. No relationship yet, nothing serious, apparently they were just discussing it. She ended up flirting with another guy during that process and eventually she just made out with this new guy. Obviously he didn't like this, and very understandably but this is were all this stops being just a highschool drama and things get serious. 

Because of her mistake, he had now had the perfect setting to manipulate her, gripping on this mistake and making sure she wouldn't forget it ever. Here's the thing... When I started getting close to her, was the time that he was hitting her up in order to meet her and multiple times had they gotten out and ended up having sex. The sick part is that when she was begging him to let the past be past and try again from the beginning, he was constantly refusing to get back with her while keeping up reminding her of how terrible of a person she is for ""cheating on him"". 

After a while, where I was trying to help her with her situation, as the friend of hers I'd become by now, this was still happening. She was begging him to get back with her and forgive, he was refusing to, kept up bullying her for her mistake but also hitting her up and giving her hopes that they'd retry only to go out have sex and then disappear from her life for days. After this, I finally started getting her to realize that she was harming herself and that she should move on. Her being confident, next time he'd texted her to go out, she refused and she told him that she was finally ***moving on***...

From that point on, he got fixated on her but not in a good way. He kept promising her love, and that everything would go back as it was, only to make her let her guard down and go out with him, have sex again and then proceeding to crush her hopes telling her that she was a shitty person and he didn't wanna get back with her. 

This situation has escalated for the past six months and having tried everything to stop her from going back to him,  I realized that, from a point forward, she'd started to deny the fact that he is using her and started willingly lying to herself, always denying facts and putting herself into the illusion that things would go back to as they were and that she could be happy with him. It wasn't until they had a fight where after he'd finished insulting and lowering her, he started love bombing her and showering her into affection, that I realized what this thing exactly was: ***an abuse cycle***.

For the past six months she has been used for sex, insulted by him, emotionally and verbally abused and threatened by him and yet she still lies to herself, denying the reality of the situation and she blames herself thinking that he is right to act this way because she had mistreated him. Earlier today she told me that I was trying to manipulate her into abandoning the love of her life, while also claiming she might commit suicide because of what she did. All this and he still keeps passing blame on her and claims that he did nothing wrong.

I seriously believe that she is suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, developed during the constant experiencing of this cycle of abuse. She is 18, turning 19 in June. I would have tried to convince her on seeking professional help but, she is still in school so she lives with her family, the financial situation of is really difficult, she couldn't even dream of affording a psychologist. Also her parents are uneducated and conservative. The one time she tried asking for an appointment with a psychologist in the past for another reason, they told her that she doesn't need one and that ""it's all in her head"".

I haven't told her my assumption yet but I believe she will deny it, of course. Every available info on the characterization of Stockholm Syndrome I was able to find, match the exact ""symptoms"" she is experiencing at the moment and the same goes for the assumption I made about their situation for the past six months being an abuse cycle.

***Having written enough, please, I am begging you, if you have any info on how to deal with this kind of thing, from personal experience, or if you're a professional, please let me know. I need to do something and I am helpless.

fu0ja6,My girlfriends cousin assaulted her,"Long story short, my girlfriends cousin is trying to move In with them and he stays in my girlfriends bed for the time being while they sort out the living situation, i don’t mind because they’re cousins but he ends up fingering her in her sleep whiles she’s drunk, like black out drunk and she wakes up and says stop and they both go back to bed but my gf isn’t actually sure anything went down . To my knowledge he dips the next day or something and my girlfriend hasn’t really talked about it all that much and is too afraid to talk about it because it would ruin a lot of relationship but that’s doesn’t make sense because this was before anything happened witn her cousin and her friend had a baby. 

Now this might make seem like a bad person but my gf and this cousin are really close still and they hang out and smoke weed together and she says they aren’t but I see it when I’m around them they seem totally normal and it really rubs me the wrong way. She won’t let me do anything about this and it just makes me so mad because it just seems weird. 

Idk if I’m being a horrible human but I feel like they might have done soMeaning while they’re drunk, she’s been raped twice before and she’s cried and been unbelievably sad and hasn’t talked to those guys ever Again and I find it weird she buddy buddy with her cousins. 

I do love my gf but I have horrible anxiety and I know this situation is only hurting her and our relationship and I can’t help but get this horrible feeling about  it

Everytime I try to bring it up she gets uncomfortable and refuses to talk about it, but I think It’s better if we do.  When I bring it up she’s cries and says she wouldn’t fake or lie about being assaulted or anything like that and that I don’t get how hard it is and that she’s too afraid to bring it up to anyone and if she does she’s afraid of getting made fun of or blamed for instigating it or something, this same cousin did the same thing to his now gf and my girlfriend was gonna bring it up but didn’t wanna ruin her relationship with her best friend, she says it’s easier to just pretend nothing happened but that bothers me that her cousin still contacts her and shit and they hang out in groups I just get a weird vibe, the only people she has told is me and her mom and I want to tell more people but gets mad and starts to break down. This is the 3rd time she’s being assaulted like this but I think she’s too afraid of the repercussions to do anything about it, also I know she was drinking with her and friend and blacked out and she woke up to this guy fingering her. She tells me she’d get a lie detector test to prove she’s not lying and nothing was consensual.",ballsforboys,2020-04-02 20:09:32,5,528,4.77,69.55,26.52,1,52.8,10.98,96.4,64.58,24.81,16.1,6.44,0.38,0,7.58,1.7,8.71,2.65,11.17,11.36,6.44,12.69,2.84,21.4,4.92,2.46,0.57,0.19,1.14,7.01,1.14,5.87,1.7,1.89,1.14,20.27,1.89,3.22,7.77,1.52,15.15,2.65,1.7,1.33,4.73,1.52,6.06,2.65,0.38,0.76,1.33,2.27,0.76,0.19,0.19,0.95,10.98,5.87,0.76,2.84,1.7,0.57,3.6,15.34,0.95,10.98,2.08,5.11,3.98,0.19,0.95,0.38,0,0,0,1.52,0.19,1.14,0,0,0.19,8.71,1.7,1.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.3,0,0
fu43qj,I (15f) found out my online friend (16m) is being physically and emotionally abused by his mother,"I only met this guy a month or two online and we mainly communicate through snapchat. Last night we had a reasonably deep conversation and he told me that he ‘gets beat’. I asked him who did it to him and he said it was his mother because she ‘despises’ him and his father, and says his parents still live together despite it being ‘the most toxic relationship’ he’s ever seen. I hadn’t heard from him in a while, around 16 or 17 hours which was out of the ordinary behaviour for him and he finally reached out to me a few hours ago saying that his parents have taken his phone trying but he is trying to stay in contact with me. I asked him if he was okay and he showed me a video of his arm which was visibly red and was laced with darker red cut and scratch marks. I asked him who did it, he said his mother. I suggested he take photos of his cuts and bruising as proof of what’s happening and he said he had already done so. I asked if he had told anyone about this and he says he has a therapist but has not yet told her. I am trying my best to emotionally support and reassure him that it isn’t his fault and he seems very appreciative of my help. I don’t know how long this has been going on or if his younger brother is receiving the same abuse. I’m not sure what else I can do to help him, which is why I am writing this here to you fellow redditors.

fuanpm,Is it possible to still be in love with your abuser?,"This is a genuine question I have, I was in DV relationship for 6 years. 6 months ago I had the strength to leave after another incident happened.

fuivvk,How can I help us survive? How do I stay gone,"I left yesterday with my kid (made this throwaway account for secrecy) I was supposed to go to my moms and someone sent me money to get there but she texted and said he actually DID know her new address so last minute I went to a hotel and put the room in my moms friends name. I used all the money sent to me for two nights, I have to leave tomorrow AM or pay for another room. I can go to my sisters but it's a state away so the Uber or bus there I can't afford. Mom can't help financially. I've called 211 and the resources given took my name and number and someone will be in touch...but I won't hold my breath. What can I do in the meantime to raise some money? There's a job waiting for me with my sisters small business, and in reg.

fulnjf,I called CAS on my parents and younger brother.,"This might be all over the place but im distraught as it just happened within the past 3 hours. 

I stopped by their apartment to share some news and my brother and i exchanged some words because he was basically downplaying my news and it upset me. (I was being a dick to be honest) 
he then proceeded to go into a violent rage spit in my face and grab me trying to punch me (HE Is only 15 and im 25) hes also about half a foot taller and has about 80 pounds on me.

My dad just sits there not saying a word while im yelling at him to call the cops because hes scared of him and i went down to tell my mom and she took a handful of anxiety medication (shes an addict) and basically ignores the whole problem and even told us to “fight it out” because she didnt know what to do.... 

Ive been out of that house for 4 years now and ive watched my brother change into a violent hateful human, 
Both of my parents (myself included now) are terrified of him so they have no will to deal with any of it and let him run free. 

But in my mind he needs parental structure that he IS NOT GETTING and thats impossible with my mom being addicted to anxiety medication and my dad condoning all of this negativity and aggression. 
but if he attacked me as violently as he did who else will he do it too in the future? 

My dad is the one normal person in that household but he has no backbone lets all of this happen, just yesterday he came to my fiancee and mine apartment because him and my mom got into a fight and my brother choked him out. 

Im truly scared that if it gets worse my brother will harm someone else or himself and i didnt know what to do, i didnt want to call the police incase he lied and said i attacked him so i called CAS and explained what happened.

fun4e6,Was quarantined with abusive ex for three weeks,"A few weeks ago I posted here about leaving my verbally and emotionally abusive ex-boyfriend, X, who I also live with. We have two other housemates (who are dating), Y and Z.

About three weeks ago, the university closed down. The bars and restaurants shut down the day after so my house were all spending that evening together drinking and chatting. This was the first time X and I had spoken since the break-up and he was planning on going home the next day. We eventually ran out of cider so X ran to the shop to get some.

Whilst he was at the shop, I was talking to Z about the break-up and she was encouraging me to stay strong and keep my distance. I listened to her advice was planning to make my excuses and go to bed once X got home. About a second later we received a text on the house group chat. Someone had been stabbed just outside the shop. I tried to call X but he wouldn't answer. Y was being totally complacent about the whole thing and wanted to stay out of it. I was deeply concerned. I ran to the shop, Z followed.

There was blood everywhere - more than I've seen in my entire life. Like something from TV. There was a man on the floor, almost dead. A crowd of people stood around and it seemed like they wanted to help, but X was one of the two people being even remotely helpful - he was on the phone to the ambulance and someone else was putting pressure on the wound. X said the ambulance said we should talk to him to keep him awake. I got beside him and got him talking. The boy next to me was skinny with small hands and was unable to put enough pressure on the wound. I must have asked four times for someone to help and no one did, until X stepped in.

X and I sat side by side, the man just in front of us, working as a team to help him survive. Initially, I was purely focussed on doing the job, and then around ten minutes in I realized that this man might die. I didn't let it affect my actions but it all felt surreal and it motivated me to do an even better job. Eventually, the police came and Z directed them to us. One spoke to X and another tried to locate the wound with my help. The ambulance was a few minutes behind them. When they arrived, the police thanked X and I for helping him and said we saved his life.

Once everyone left I started sobbing. Z tried to comfort me but the only person able to properly was X. Seeing him help that man made me remember why I loved him. We went for a long walk but when we got home, I felt so much anxiety about the whole thing on top of everything I'd felt from leaving X and being with him. All I wanted to do was forget everything and I slept with X. We both said ""I love you"".

The next day we both had coronavirus symptoms which meant we couldn't leave the house. Y and Z didn't so we could only really interact with each other. At the time government guidance said to stay indoors for a week if you have symptoms so we made the joint decision to escape reality for a few days and continue to share a bed, say ""I love you"", etc, whilst we helped each other through the illness

This didn't work because my symptoms became pretty severe. I thought, being young, it'd be like a flu, but mine were so bad that an ambulance was called on me one night. Throughout everything X was amazing. He stayed up all night with me waiting for the ambulance, and was more than happy to stay awake for me every night. He had exams but put me before them. He went to get me special medicine to help my symptoms. Through the whole thing I felt utterly helpless and I felt I couldn't get through it without him. His symptoms were quite bad but not as bad as mine, but they oscillated in severity over time, so there were times where I returned the favour for him.

During this time I faced backlash from friends who knew from Y and Z about us. One said I was using X and leading him on, and another said it was unfair that I'd called X abusive because 'clearly he isn't' from my behaviour following. I stand by my claims of X being abusive and I feel bad about going back but I was facing extraordinary circumstances and was one of the worst times in my life. The lack of support from friends pushed me further towards X who wasn't judging or accusing me.

We decided to wait until the symptoms cleared to talk. But then it got to a point where it had been a long enough time frame that it was no longer ""just a few days escaping reality"" but the new reality. Cutting it off would have been an active movement, and continuing as we were was passive. After a week, the symptoms became manageable, and then it was my birthday, and we celebrated that together.

Our symptoms cleared completely maybe three days ago and when this happened I booked a train home (for today). In total, I spent three weeks with him (after breaking up).

I was so blown away by the level of love I felt from him. I wanted nothing more than to go back to him. I feel like my entire future has changed and all the reasons for leaving I had before like needing to prioritize my career and mental health don't really apply now. I was so happy to be spending every day with my best friend and felt so lucky to be there.

I was trying to think of ways we could be together, but what I need is to see he's changed. I think he was on 'best-behaviour' because he was trying to win me back, and I think it was easier for him to play the hero when facing circumstances like this. This also isn't exactly out of character. When I'm down, he has always loved building me back up and showing me love, but it's when I'm live and well, expressing my own opinions and making my own decisions that he will abuse me if I've done something he doesn't like. A friend has said that X didn't exactly have much to do with his time so all the selfless gestures like baking me a birthday cake and going to the pharmacy for me also benefited him. Also, given how controlling X is, three weeks where I am entirely dependent on him, sexually available, emotionally available, and have no friends/life outside of him is, some could argue, his dream scenario. As cold as this seems, I tend to agree.

If I were to stay with him, I'd need him to admit to me everything he's done in full, acknowledge that change will be a long process, and find some abuse counselling to help change his behaviour. Conversely, he has stated (within these three weeks) that I've never been abused, has claimed to have changed basically overnight, and has credited his enhanced level of empathy and intelligence as the reason.

There were also red flags - he made a dig at me and tried to blame me for it (he argued with me for over an hour before admitting he was wrong), and then he did the same thing later when he was rude and condescending. This was one day out of 21 but given his history it's important to me that he's never even slightly abusive. There was also a point where he was trying to tell Y something about me that directly contradicted what I had just said, and then he told me I was wrong when I corrected him. He also told me a story about a couple he knows, and skimmed over the part of the story where the boyfriend broke the girlfriend's window purposely during an argument, as if it were no big deal. He told me another story about a girl he knew who was abused, and told her story on TV, and he thought she was in the wrong because lots of people know who her ex is. These actions don't strike me as those of a reformed abuser.

Everything else he did for me is amazing but it doesn't mean he won't abuse me again in the future. These bad actions are relatively minor in compariosn but are exactly the types of red flags I ignored when I started dating him.

I'm really struggling. I know that I need to end it (again) but I don't want to. I feel so in love with him and I want to believe in him so bad. I'm contemplating trying to push him towards abuse counselling. It does seem like there's a great deal of love there, so part of me thinks it might be possible.

I would appreciate any thoughts from readers.",_silly_billy_,2020-04-03 21:10:31,15,1562,38.87,61.84,61.34,27.9,18.82,14.92,92.57,58.77,19.08,13.96,7.62,1.34,0.19,4.42,0.38,5.12,5.63,14.21,9.73,5.83,8.51,1.6,19.72,4.29,2.62,1.6,1.41,2.56,5.06,2.56,2.43,0.26,1.15,0.19,13.44,0,0.51,0.38,4.48,11.91,2.88,1.6,1.6,1.98,2.11,2.75,2.05,0.38,0.9,0.77,2.56,0.19,1.41,0.06,0.38,8.45,3.78,1.66,2.43,0.9,0.83,9.92,6.79,1.22,15.49,3.07,6.47,6.53,1.15,1.09,0.7,0.51,0,0.13,0.26,0,0,0.06,0.06,0,13.06,5.25,3.65,0,0,0,0,0.45,0.38,2.5,0.77,0.06

fv3u70,"My brother abuses my autistic brother and I, I don’t know what to do","I’ll try to keep this short but I am truly at my wits end.

For context, my household consists of me, (17F), my older brother “Ben” who has severe autism and cannot speak (23M), my oldest brother “John” (M26) who will be the subject, and my mother with Stage 4 breast cancer of nearly 6 years(F61). 

My oldest brother abuses my brother and I verbally and physically. 

It’s gotten to the point where my autistic brother is regressing, unable to move or do something on his own because my oldest brother is constantly screaming at him. He often hits him and pushes him if he doesn’t do what he asks immediately. Because I take my mom to her cancer treatments or she drove while I was at school, John would be left to “take care of” Ben (aka put him in front of the TV, throw random junk food in front of him, put him on the computer, etc). Ben constantly recoils whenever John is around him, especially when he touches him or speaks to him.

I used to be able to avoid John through school and work most times, but during quarantine my proximity is unfortunately close. In the past years, he has pushed me, put his hands on my neck, thrown gatorade bottles at me, thrown baskets at me, and screamed at me constantly (“bitch, whore, fat bitch, motherfucker,” etc). I am currently in the middle of a panic attack after he screamed at me for putting a sweatshirt I thought was his on his bed and being called a “fat fucking bitch”. 

I am at a loss for what to do. My mom won’t consider putting Ben into someone else’s care even though she’s not well, she won’t kick my brother out of the house despite him not having a job, my aunt isn’t in state and hasn’t done anything despite me already telling her all this, and I have no other family nearby.

fv4mz9,Need advice: Best friend not supportive of new healthy relationship,"My best friend and I are both in our mid-twenties and we’ve known each other for 5 years. I left a 3 year abusive relationship about 7 months ago. She was super supportive throughout the whole process and has always been a great friend. 

I’ve been seeing a new guy for a few months now who is kind, has a great job, a wonderful sense of humor, and treats me with respect. Things have started to get serious between us and he makes me very happy. I have also been going to therapy to work through my history of abuse and cultivating my own personal hobbies and growing my career. I am not exclusive with him quite yet because I have only recently been out of a relationship and I don’t want to rush into anything, but it seems to be heading in that direction at an appropriate rate. 

The problem is, any time I occasionally share something about our relationship (like “oh look at this funny video of his dog he sent me”or “we went to this cool restaurant”) to my friend she either shuts me down, passive aggressively responds “cool,” ignores it, or says “be careful.” 

She is in a happy long-term relationship so it doesn’t seem like jealousy and I try my best not to overshare or only talk about him when I message her. When I confronted her about her attitude, she explained that she was concerned about me falling in love with someone else too fast even though she admitted he sounded like a healthy, nice guy with no obvious red flags. 

While I understand her concern and appreciate her advice, it feels kind of condescending. I want to have a friend who I can talk about guys with without feeling judged or patronized. I always engage her in conversations about her boyfriend and have helped her through her own relationship troubles in the past. I’ve told her how I felt about all this and she seems to think like she knows what is best for me. Her suggestion is that I be completely celibate for a year or two to “find myself without a partner.” I feel like this is a good suggestion but not realistic. I wish she could just be happy for me and trust that I am healing at my own pace. 

Am I being unhealthy or irrational? I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me on this matter with my friend.

There is a supervisor who watches them so we don’t have any contact. However sometimes he still yells at me, breaking the no contact order that’s in place. Because of this I’ve begun recording the exchanges. Today however I noticed he’s begun recording me too.

fv6pv9,I want to leave but I can't bring myself to do it.,"I need to leave. He hit me once back in January, and forcefully grabbed me in front of our coworkers at a work party. After that, he was incredibly apologetic and promised to stop drinking. He did until about 2 days ago. He wasn't mean or anything, but it still scared me.

I'm now being given the silent treatment for making too much noise. If I ask him a question, he'll either ignore me or reply in a terribly rude manner. Two days ago, I was talking about this movie I really liked and he just turned on the vacuum.

These might seem like stupid examples, but they're just piling on one after the other. He's incredibly spiritual, to the point where I'm suspecting psychosis, and he thinks I'm possessed and an evil spirit. He thinks I draw in evil spirits with my presence and that me having sleep paralysis is ""Baphomet trying to reclaim my soul as I am a demon.""

He's just so mean for no reasons. Since we're stuck together in quarantine, it's become increasingly harder. He'll often call me names and just do anything in his power to diminish me, and then get mad at me and call me a pussy for being sad about it.

When he gets in his moods, I'm scared to even sneeze around him. I get panic attacks whenever I have to get up in the middle of the night to go pee because I know if I wake him up I'll get yelled at, talked down to and insulted. 

There's good times too sometimes though, which us what is making it so hard for me to leave. I'm from a different province altogether, 4000km away from my family and my friends. I have no one in this town, and it's such a small town. He's also the only person I know that speaks English, and I'm not completely comfortable speaking French. I'm just so scared one day he'll hurt my cat or me. I NEED to leave.

If someone (a new victim, an employer, etc.) were to google him, I want this to also come up.

Are there any websites/forums/platforms that allow for anonymous posting while being able to name an abuser?

Also, I would really prefer it if you could avoid telling me why this is not a good idea. I've given this a lot of thought and have talked to a counselor specializing in DV about it.

fvjmm2,ISO advice on online safety for survivors/victims who may need resources but are sheltered-in-place with their abusers and cannot risk detection,"Does anyone know the safest medium to access resources online without detection? 

I am very concerned that survivors/victims who are in close proximity to their abusers due to shelter-in-place orders may need to access information and resources but will expose themselves to greater risk should they do so in a manner that leaves their digital movement detectable by their abusers. For example, many websites have an escape feature throughout the page so that visitors can quickly switch to a more neutral page such as Google or a news article to avoid detection. While some of these sites are able to keep their URL from appearing in the browser history, the data is still stored elsewhere in cookies and, on platforms like Facebook, can be used for the purpose of targeted ads, both of which can endanger the visitor should theirs abuser notice it.

I am a law school graduate with a focus on intellectual property who did research on the intersection of technology and domestic violence during my last semester, so I lack the computer/smart phone savviness to know what option is safest for those at high risk right now.",garcinr77,2020-04-05 12:26:54,2,218,84.26,57.29,38.62,3.65,36.33,24.77,83.94,50.92,11.01,5.5,1.83,0,0,0,3.67,5.5,6.42,16.97,9.63,3.21,5.5,0.92,11.93,3.67,2.75,2.29,0,1.83,8.26,2.75,5.05,1.83,1.83,0,6.88,0,0,0,0,10.09,1.83,0.92,2.29,3.21,0,2.29,0.92,0.46,0.46,0,0.46,0,0,0,0.46,9.63,0.46,1.83,2.29,0.92,4.13,0.92,10.55,1.38,15.6,1.83,10.09,4.13,4.13,0.92,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.26,1.83,2.75,0,0,0.46,0,1.83,0,0,0,1.38
fvjrsg,My boyfriend is occasionally abusive and I don't know what to do?,"Hi guys, I've never posted on reddit before but I really need somewhere to turn to. This is something I have never been able to talk about with my friends/family for reasons that may become clear.

I have been with my boyfriend for nearly 2 years now, we are both 26 and live together. Our relationship is (nearly) amazing, we love each other very much and I have been sure since the day I met him that we were supposed to end up together.

The problem is though, he has crazy anger management problems, these were clear from almost the offset of moving in. It started off with just screaming but things have escalated over time. It went from screaming and storming off, to throwing things (once a glass which smashed across the living room), to throwing things at me, he has (maybe in the last 8 months) escalated to physically touching me, he has pushed me, shook me, pushed me on the floor and cowered over me screaming. Despite all of this he has never hit me before and says he never would/could, even when he's all worked up he knows that. Today it escalated even further (I think) though. I came home from doing the weekly shop, which is already stressful enough at the moment given all the restrictions about COVID-19, and as we were both unpacking the shopping I said something he didn't like and he has another outburst which just terrify me now and (this is going to sound ridiculous I know) but he had a packet of asparagus in his hand and he hit me round the face with it. Even though it was only packet asparagus I must admit it really hurt and I can't help but think this is just another escalation. Whenever we have spoken about things afterwards and hes laid his hands on me I've always said how scared I am that he's going to really hurt me one day but he says that he know he never could, even when he's in that state.

It's worth mentioning that none of this is in anyway alcohol related and he is not abusive in any other way. He is not controlling or mean to me, in fact he is amazing and supportive of everything I do and really is everything I could wish for apart from these awful outburst he gets. I would say on average they happen around once a month although there have been times when it has been twice a week.

This comes from such a painful place for him and he knows this is wrong and so wants to change himself which makes this so much harder. I am terrified of him sometimes but at the same time feel so sorry for him at other times. He had been getting help for this. He was seeing a counsellor for a while which i think helped him mentally to understand the deep rootedness of where this anger comes from although the outburst weren't really stopping so we decided together that he should start seeing someone specific for anger management which he did, although i can't tell if this has helped as everything had to stop due to COVID-19 so he is now not seeing anyone.  He has been to support groups in the past as well but nothing seems to help and I just don't know what to do anymore. Nothing he seems to try in battling this seems to work, it's only ever escalated.

I really do not want to leave this man, he is perfect in every other way and wants to stop this behaviour but can't seem to. I'm also at my wits end though, I don't talk to me friends and family about this as I don't want their opinion of him to change as he really is such a good man this is just his downfall. But it's like a dirty little secret that only both of us know. I'm so worried that one day the neighbours might see through the window or something.

Please help, any advice or just thoughts would be great. I'm not sure where else to turn at this point.",antm222,2020-04-05 12:35:10,32,716,11.57,44.45,65.95,7.81,25.57,13.41,95.39,64.8,22.77,13.41,6.28,1.12,0,5.73,0.28,9.22,3.63,13.41,11.87,8.94,8.1,3.07,21.65,4.33,1.54,2.09,1.4,2.37,5.17,1.82,3.35,0.7,0.98,0.42,12.99,0.28,0.84,0,6.42,18.58,3.35,1.12,2.37,3.77,3.35,6.15,3.49,0.98,1.4,1.26,1.26,0.42,0.7,0,0.14,6.84,3.63,0.56,1.68,0.7,0.84,5.03,15.08,0.98,15.78,2.23,6.7,6.84,0.7,0.84,0.84,0.42,0,0,0.42,0,0.14,0,0.14,0.14,11.73,3.77,2.93,0,0,0.14,0,0.28,0,2.93,1.4,0.28
fvpyl5,My daughter doesn’t want a relationship with me because of my past abusive relationship,"My[36] daughter is 16. Me and her father split when she was 3 and he never came back to be in her life,ever. I had found someone new when she was about 5 and he started out really nice but became really abusive once we had gotten serious. I tried to leave multiple times but I could never really go though with it. The time I almost seriously left I almost lost my life. He pulled a gun on me. After that I just stopped trying. I guess he grew tired of me about 2 years ago and just decided to up and leave me. 

Though that was a blesssing, I won’t lie, it still hurt me for some reason that he left ME. Like I was the sane one in the relationship, how did he leave me ? I’m getting I’ve rot now but it’s still really confusing. 

These last 2 years I’ve been trying to get my life together and repair the damage I’ve put my daughter through. I have always tried to make home a happy place for her and I covered up the abuse. When she was little I would say “oh we were playing when you heard us yelling” or try to make it seem like she just was having a bad dream when she would say she heard us fighting and screaming or I’d cover up with makeup (I’ve learned in therapy l that I was SUPER wrong and irresponsible for telling her she was dreaming and dismissing her REAL experiences). I thought I was shielding her by making her think it wasn’t real but the older she got, the more the abuse was done in front of her &amp; it confirmed I had lied to her. 

He has beat me, called me names, exposed our sex life, and more in front of her over and over. She would beg me to leave but I never did. Now she hates me for it. 

She’s started to rebel about the same time he left me. I’ve tried to take her to therapy with me but she just won’t talk to the therapist. I’ve tried taking her on nail/hair trips with me and it doesn’t work. Last year she said she wanted to stay with her grandma and I told her no. I wanted her to stay with me so she can see how much i was gonna change and be better

I know she’s hurting and I know it’s my fault but I don’t know how to fix it. I hate that I put her through this. 

Her rebellion is really becoming too much. She talks back, sneaks out, gets into drama, and is just plain disrespectful sometimes. I’m stuck between trying to be a parent &amp; trying to be understanding of her behavior. I feel like it’s not my place to try to be some authoritative parent (even though I’m doing it to try to save her) when I’ve allowed her to see men walk all over me. 

My therapist said that although she is still a child she’s at the age that I need to have a grown woman conversation with her about womanhood, abusive relationships and low self esteem. I feel like this quarantine might be the best time to have a long conversation with her, but like I stated she wants to live with her grandma. For like 2 weeks she kept going to her friends houses because she doesn’t want to be with me. This week I told her there was no leaving period! So she’s been in her room all day and night. She kept saying she wanted to go live with her grandma so I decided to try to make her happy and come to a middle ground. Being that this quarantine might last a month or 2, I asked my mom to stay with us during it. My daughter seems really happy. 

I told my therapist and she said that it was a smart idea and that I should have the conversation with my daughter in front or my mom so that my mom can mediate. I don’t know how to even start the conversation, but I have to.

Has anyone ever been in this situation of trying to make your kid forgive you? I would appreciate any advice. I want to save my baby before she enters adulthood.",jasminej83,2020-04-05 18:52:17,5,748,15.04,55.84,57.02,9.38,17.81,10.29,95.19,61.9,25.13,20.72,11.1,0.8,0.4,8.42,0,4.41,3.48,13.1,10.83,6.82,7.35,1.87,25,2.81,2.01,1.34,1.34,1.34,5.08,1.87,3.21,0.13,1.6,0.53,16.71,2.01,0.13,9.09,1.34,14.04,3.07,1.87,1.87,3.61,1.07,3.48,2.27,0.27,1.34,0.53,1.74,0,1.6,0.13,0,8.56,2.41,2.81,2.27,1.2,0.53,8.56,12.83,0.94,14.71,3.21,5.61,6.55,0.27,0.53,0.4,0,0.13,0,0.27,0,0.13,0,0.13,0,12.7,5.08,2.01,0,0.27,0.27,0.13,0,0.27,3.48,0.53,0.67

fvxs01,How do you get over/talk about emotional and verbal abuse?,"In my post history, you can see my history with a live-in abusive partner. An element of abuse was present in the relationship for 9 months but only became so severe in the last 2-3, after we became 'official'. I left him 4 weeks ago, then a week later we witnessed a traumatic event together, had sex, and both woke up with coronavirus symptoms. The coronavirus symptoms were bad and added to the traumatic bonding. We lived and acted as a couple for 3 weeks and he was on best behaviour. I am home now away from him.

I've been through a lot in my life so far. I'm 22 but I've battled severe depression, 2 sexual assaults, PTSD, emotional abuse from my twin and watching them go through suicide attempts, and an abrupt end to my first real relationship. This has all been crammed within 5 years, and most of it within 1 year (between the age of 17-18). Every time I've faced a challenge like this I've always been really good at talking about it, finding the help I need, and overcoming it. I advocate for myself to ensure my university or school don't refuse me the support I need, and I reach out to friends. I'm resourceful and have managed to drastically improve my life despite everything.

This relationship is completely different. I don't feel able to talk to anyone about it, I feel distant from everyone in my life even though there's no clear reason why, I don't even want to talk to them. 

I had to completely shut off my feelings of betrayal and hurt to get through the past 3 weeks and now they're coming back. I don't feel like anyone understands. Everyone has their own relationships and problems and they usually project them. Everyone keeps telling me ""it's going to be alright"" but that's not why I'm so upset. I'm not scared. They keep saying ""of course it's sad when relationships end"" but that's not why I'm sad - I don't even feel like it's ended. It's so hard for me to figure out never mind explain to anyone else why I feel so hurt by this. Objectively, I've been through worse.

The worst bit is that he is the only person I trust with my emotions right now. I don't even know why. I understand logically that it's trauma bonding, but that doesn't make me feel like I need him any less or want to confide in others.

I don't want to reach out to resources because I was only abused by him for 2-3 months. I don't feel like those resources are meant for me, especially at a time like this when so many women are trapped with physical abusers. I'm out of my situation now so I don't need help leaving.

The thing getting me through is knowing that one day this will all be one bad memory. I think emotional abuse is very common for young girls to go through, and I can't imagine how many people I know have and don't even understand that they were abused. It makes me feel weak that teenage girls can cope better than me with relationships like this.

Over the past few days reddit has been my main source of emotional support which makes me feel pathetic. I've also devoted a lot of time to university work and reading which helps. I've created a playlist of songs that either help me feel empowered or describe my experience. I'm hoping time will help. Can anyone relate?

fvycmp,"My friend suffers from domestic abuse in a foreign coutry and her boyfriend keeps her from going outside of the house and now from communicating to the outside world. things that we, her friends, should do?","she is currently in czech republic, over time her boyfriend has taken away things from her one to mention is that she isnt allowed to go outside of the house (they live at his parent's house, but the father shows no care/is oblivious of things) and now we know from reliable source that he took away her phone and her 2nd phone, he also keeps her from using a pc so essencially he has privated her from communication to the outside world, her health state is now unknown wich is fucking scary.

today is the 11th day since he took her communication away. ive been trying to find her address so i can call the cops or an organization to help me (me and other 2 close friends of hers are helping).  


meanwhile i want to GET INFORMED. so what i want from reddit is someone preferably with experience to tell me things i need to gather so that when we found her address/full name and the cops or organization shows up to the home; he wont get away with lying and obligate her to lie that everything is fine, because he does have deep mental control over her, he controls her and obligates her to do fucked up things she doesnt want to, so it is highly possible this scenario will happen.  


im trying to find the house and/or contact information of her biological father who cares for her. 99% of my time is being put in the search i only eat and go to the bathroom and unfortunately ive only been able to sleep every 2 or 3 days. i need help, please someone help us.

fvz6si,Friend being abused by her parents,"I have a friend who is being emotionally and verbally abused by her parents, they are trying to keep her from moving out even though she's 19 &amp; can't stand living with their torture anymore. They have lied to her, called her horrible things and so much worse. Her most recent attempt at moving out her parents told her they had the title to her car changed behind her back to her dad when it was only her name on it before. She thinks they have friends at the title office that passed it through. She also fully believes that if she tries to leave they will call the cops and bring her back. Ive tried to explain to her that her parents don't have the power she thinks, and the only power they have is what she gives them out of fear.

Is there anyway her parents could have possibly changed the title without her knowing? And is there anyway we can find out whose name is on the vehicle now? Also does anyone know of any helpful resources for people in her situation being abused and lies to by her parents to keep her from leaving make her a slave in the home?

fw0wc1,Is it ok to forgive and forget about what happen?,"I live with my fiancé. We’ve been together around 2 years. We had a small break type thing at the start of this year but it wasent really a break I guess we still stayed in the same house he just slept in the other room for a few nights. 

The reason we had that ‘break’ is because of an incident that happened over New Years. He was intoxicated at the time and he just wasent really acting like himself at all. He treated me very bad that night. He fractured the bone in my wrist from slamming my hand on the table and I had purple bruising around my neck from where he’d tried to grab me by the back of the neck and push me onto the floor. 

He was very violent toward me which is something he’d never been before. I was very fearful of him after that night but since then nothing like that has ever happened. He’s back to himself now he’s very sweet and calm and happy. 

He dosent remember everything that happened on the night but he has apologised for it and he even cried when we realised the bone in my arm was fractured (he came with me to the hospital the next day).

He’s been sober since that day as well. He was going to have a drink just a few days ago and I freaked out a bit. But I explained to him that I dident think it was a good idea especially since we’re in lockdown atm so it’s just him and I at home. He was very understanding and listened to me and he assured me he was only intending to have the one drink and that he’d never react violently toward me again. He asked me if I would feel better if he dident have the drink and I said yes. He did not have the drink. 

Do you think it’s ok to forgive him for the one night ? I genuinely believe it was because he was too intoxicated and he’d also taken something so I feel that affected his judgement and he just wasent himself ? 

The person he is and the person he was that night are 2 different people. I love him so much and feel this might have been just a very big hiccup 

Is this something we can get over and go on to be a healthy couple and live a good life? 

If anyone has advice on what steps to take to ensure something like this dosent happen again, I’d be willing to hear it

fw34dn,Would you accept someone accused/charged with DV?,"Hello, I’m a 21 year old guy from Georgia in perhaps the most miserable time in my life. I grew up experiencing and witnessing domestic violence from my father. My parents divorced and my stepfather was incredibly emotionally abusive to me and my family as well. I have a diagnosis of high-functioning autism and bipolar II. I’ve had a very hard life, and I struggled with anger often throughout my adolescence. I couldn’t make many friends and I was an outcast.
Things changed when I turned 18. I fought social anxiety and became a firefighter in my community. It was extremely hard, but I made something out of myself. I wanted to help and heal people. I wanted to right every wrong. I got entangled in a very toxic relationship with my first love. She would lead me on and then act absolutely cruel, making every nightmare come true, and then fix everything only to do it again. After telling me she was in love with me, becoming my first kiss, and making it seem like my pursuit was won, she told me there was nothing there and left again. Explaining she was a lesbian and couldn’t like guys. She had told me this before so I bought it. It was detrimental to me despite this and I lost control. I was so codependent. My mom and stepfather separated and she started dating this guy who would take up all her time. We started getting into arguments because she would leave me with horses and a sister to take care of at random times for days on end. I didn’t have the energy to work two jobs, fight fire as a volunteer, and hold on to myself during my heartbreak along with all this responsibility, so I lost control and during an argument with my mom, put my hand over her mouth and yelled at her. Police were called and I was taken to jail for DV, simple battery, despite my mom not pressing charges. I had never been arrested before and I felt so bad after losing my temper that I left the house intending to commit suicide. The police knew this when pulling me over, and put me in the jail’s medical unit when I arrived there. It was extremely traumatic for me. I was made to resign from my post as a firefighter with my county and lost allot of work. I tried getting another job working at a store, a huge downgrade from what I was doing, and couldn’t do it. I tried moving to my grandparents while my mom and I tried to reconcile and I collapsed and ended up making an attempt on my life again. My ex had returned again with a replacement and rubbed him in my face, I was convinced she was gay and didn’t love me because of it, but she started a long distance relationship with some kid far away in Illinois. I couldn’t process it. 

I was given a bond and was made to attend FVIP classes. I was dismissed from them after a trip to the hospital. My heart is so broken and to read things on here about people avoiding those like me make me feel even more hopeless. I have no desire to control anyone and all I ever wanted was to be selfless after surviving being rejected and abused myself. I don’t want this label and I don’t want to be a red flag. I know I can heal from this but I feel like it’s not worth it if my fate is sealed. Am I worthy of being loved and accepted? I need honesty.",iSPACECOWBOY98,2020-04-06 10:38:14,9,620,32.21,23.4,82.53,7.28,15.9,16.61,92.9,59.68,20.81,16.13,13.55,0.16,0.16,2.1,0.16,4.68,4.03,14.03,8.87,4.68,9.03,2.1,19.68,3.71,2.26,0.81,0.81,1.77,7.1,2.74,4.35,0.65,1.61,1.45,9.84,1.94,0.65,2.9,1.29,12.74,2.26,2.58,2.58,1.77,2.26,1.77,1.94,0.16,0.16,1.45,3.23,0.65,1.61,0.32,0,9.68,2.9,2.42,3.06,1.29,0.65,10.32,5.81,0.48,13.71,2.26,5.48,5.81,1.77,0.16,0.48,0.48,0,0.16,0.48,0,0,0.16,0.16,0,11.77,5.97,3.06,0,0,0.32,0,0.16,0,2.1,0,0.16
fw5cb3,"How can I get the abusive drug addict father of my two year old son, removed from our apartment?","Some background. In San Diego, California. Been in a four year abusive relationship with my son’s father. He’s an alcoholic with an addictive personality meaning he goes overboard on everything beer, weed, cough syrup etc. 

A week before our son’s first birthday, he was on one of his binges—came home to our apartment and immediately began beating the shit out of me while our son slept in his crib. The cops were called by neighbors, he was arrested and taken away tied like a hog. I was granted an emergency protective order and kick out order to have him removed from our apartment. CPS was involved and I’m ashamed to admit that I was still wrapped around his finger so I forgave him, he stayed living there and we stayed together. I was granted a “no negative contact” order which is still valid until 2021. 

He did give up alcohol after that incident though he smoked a lot of weed, he was still abusive on occasion but he worked and everything was fine until again a week before our son’s second birthday. He relapsed. He wasn’t abusive but he started doing coke or crystal or some type of stimulant he was snorting. He was doing “8 balls” in a whole night, not sleeping and basically quit his job because he was up all night being paranoid and slept during the day. Meanwhile I’m working and my son is watched by my mother who is a housewife. After a month of this, I decided I was going to leave and got my own apartment which ended up being a studio in a rough neighborhood cause it was all I could get approved for. This was October of last year. 

I blitz’d the move with help from my family and he let it happen without protest cause he thought I was moving back in with my parents and he was too busy drinking, doing drugs etc. Eventually he realizes I moved out alone goes to my family’s home crying and begging them for idk what? Forgiveness and to tell me he’s sorry, he wants to make it up blah blah blah. Again, I end up forgiving him and he moves in with me by Christmas after turning in the old apartment. He gets drunk New Year’s Day and ends up getting jumped by some guys he was drinking with who tried to steal his car. They leave him head busted open in the street, bleeding and unconscious. He goes to hospital gets better whatever but he then uses this as an excuse not to work which I told him he needed to do in order to live with us. Eventually he does again and whatever everything is cool. The studio is too small for us and the area is super ghetto with no parking so we find a 2 bedroom in a nicer part of town with a parking spot. He is still drinking and often doesn’t go to work for being hungover so I end up putting 1550 for the deposit and 1550 in first month rent with no help from him. One week after being moved in, he tells me he doesn’t wanna work anymore he wants to drink full time and that I can’t do anything about it cause he is “the man of the house”. Then starts an onslaught of verbal abuse on the daily. He calls me every name in the book, insults me, disrespects me which isn’t anything new but considering he’s not working or paying any bills or doing anything productive to our household? Its driving me insane. Coronavirus happens and quarantine but I am able to work from home so I set up at my mom’s house that way I can be with my son everyday. My son’s father continues to not work, spend what little money he does have on beer and whatever drug he’s on and I decide I can’t do this anymore. I used to think he was a good person underneath it all but he’s clearly not. He’s immature, irresponsible, he isn’t a provider and I can’t keep supporting him while he disrespects me and threatens me with violence around my son. 

Last Monday, he gets up to go to work but begins cussing me out as I slept. Telling me again he deserves to be able to drink, not work, calling me names and then he tells me to apologize to him because he’s always told me that everything is my fault such as him drinking or doing drugs and quitting his jobs were all somehow my fault which I don’t believe of course but it’s unbelievably frustrating to hear that considering the reality. He ends up attacking me as I get out of bed to confront him. Again our son was asleep in his own bed in the same room. He doesn’t hit me so much as smash me under his weight and smack the back of my head and pull my hair. He again says apologize to me or I’m not gonna go to work. I tell him to fuck off and he can do whatever he wants cause I ain’t apologizing. He ends up going to work and I start thinking what can I do? 

How can I get him removed from our apartment? I worked so hard to be able to afford it, he’s contributed nothing so far and we signed a year lease. I actually had to break the lease on the studio to come here which my old landlord was gracious enough to let me do with minimal penalty. He threatened to kill me if I leave which I don’t take seriously but who knows what he’s capable of. Would it be possible for me to get some type of other kick out order to remove him for real this time? I’m just afraid to get the law involved because with our last case the social worker told me if there was ever a problem with us again they would take away my son which I understand would be my fault for having my son in this situation knowing his father is abusive to me but what can I do? I have the no negative contact order which has clearly been violated by his verbal abuse, threats and physical abuse? With coronavirus shutting everything down would I be able to file some type of motion to get him removed from our home? 

TL ; DR : Live in San Diego, California. My son’s father is an abusive tweaker/alcoholic that goes on binges where he quits his job and gets high full time which is the current situation. I have a no negative contact order because of a previous DV case that resulted in CPS involvement who threatened me that another incident would have my son removed from me. My son’s father has clearly violated that order with verbal and physical abuse as well as threats of killing me. What can I do to have my son’s father removed from the home by some type of law enforcement? He’s a lost cause who told me himself all he wants to do is be in the streets drinking and doesn’t wanna work. 

It’s also worth noting that I’m baby mama #2, he had a daughter when he was 16 making her almost 9 now. Her mother has a restraining order against him as well for what I’m guessing is the same reasons I’m dealing with now. He has 3-4 DUIs too.",raxope,2020-04-06 12:35:51,5,1276,33.78,62.6,43.79,4.41,21.27,15.52,92.55,59.25,21.63,16.46,7.84,1.33,0,7.05,0.24,5.17,4.31,14.11,10.03,4.31,6.82,2.43,17.87,3.13,1.49,2.35,1.33,1.41,4.31,1.1,3.21,0.63,2.04,0.31,15.2,2.43,0.47,0.63,8.86,9.56,1.49,1.49,1.25,1.88,1.41,2.9,0.78,0.08,0.16,0.39,3.45,0.78,1.65,0.08,1.41,9.4,2.04,2.27,3.53,1.49,0.78,4.55,12.15,1.1,16.14,2.74,5.88,7.05,2.19,1.18,2.27,0.78,0.08,0.16,0.94,0.16,0.16,0.08,0.16,0.31,11.05,3.92,2.12,0.08,0.08,0.78,0,0.08,0.47,3.37,0,0.16

 We recently had a fight over something trivial but we are both very headstrong and we were yelling at each other. I realized I needed to step away so I walked into our bedroom and locked the door. He followed me and when he realized the door was locked started beating it down with his body weight until I could hear the door starting to crack. I told him through the door ""leave me alone, you're scaring me."" To that he replied ""I don't care"" and kept throwing his weight into the door. Finally he gave up when I yelled ""you're about to break our f*cking door!"" He stopped and walked away. I still haven't talked to him about what happened but I'm not sure what to do. Is this borderline domestic violence? Should I tell him if he ever does that again I'll call the cops? 
 Again, hes never done anything like this but I was seriously freaked out when he acted like he didn't care that he was scaring me.

fwb2sr,Shelter,"Hello,

I am in a very abusive relationship where I am abused physically, emotionally and sexually daily. I know I need to leave but I am not able to take that step. I do not know why. Maybe because I do not have a job and I have never been on my own. Our child is 6 years old and he has been seeing a lot of violence at home. This quarantine is making things worse for me.

Can anyone share their experience of a women shelter here in Canada? Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? I also do not have any support, no friends and no family. I do not have any money as well. I am a new immigrant here. 

Looking forward to hear from you. Please be nice in the comments.

fwcovw,"Everything was okay, until it wasn’t. (Long post, I’m sorry)","A little back story...
Last year, things went crazy. I left my spouse (m) of then, 9 years, for another man. I moved out for about 5-6 months. Then we decided to reconcile in late October-early November. He knew everything that happened. We have two kids together, I learned later on that the court stuff he made happen was because he was jealous. Understandable. 
Back to it, when I came back he kept bringing up things that I did. Mind you he also had a girlfriend and I had to hide my car at my own house so she wouldn’t find out. And then the drinking began. It started with just a couple beers at night when he got home from work. Then he quit his job and it became a 12 pack a day, starting mid day. After that it was liquor mixed with beer. And every time he would drink he would get verbally and mentally abusive. Like, extremely. I would beg and apologize every night over and over again. 

That’s when it it got bad. Really bad. He became an alcoholic. Drinking liquor (vodka) and beer (those seltzer’s) from the time he woke up, until he went to bed. Every with both kids here with him everyday I was at work. Then he started to say how he was going to kill himself over and over. Every time. The first night he threw a cup at my face I called the police. They didn’t take him because I said I didn’t want to press charges. When they left he beat the every loving crap out of me. It happened three more times in the span of a week and a half. The third time I swore he was going to kill me. I was literally clawing at the floor trying to get away. Knocked me out, kicked my ribs over and over, choked me out until I saw stars. All in front of our three year old. Fortunately he didn’t kill me. 

Thankfully the next day I broke down in front of my manager after I called him and I knew he was drunk, and I showed her all the bruises and scratches. She told me to record everything and call the police if it happened again. Well it did. And I had an hour and a half of recording. Once again in front of our daughter. I was able to make it to the bathroom and call 911 while my phone was in my back pocket. They have the 911 recording and my Apple Watch recording. 

He hasn’t drank since that night and has apologized over and over. I do love him but I don’t know if I can forgive him. His family expects me to forgive and forget because they “forgave” me for what I did. That month still rings in my ears every single day. The prosecutor told me she listened to it, and in the four years she’s been doing this, it’s the worst she’s ever heard. 

I really just need some advice and input on if anyone else has experienced this. Thanks in advance.",nancymulligan,2020-04-06 19:56:31,15,534,34.83,61.07,84.01,20.13,10.9,10.86,94.94,59.18,22.66,16.48,8.43,0.75,0.19,6.37,0.75,6.18,5.24,13.3,7.49,4.68,8.8,1.31,17.6,2.25,1.12,1.12,3,2.62,4.12,1.87,2.25,0,1.12,0.37,14.04,0.56,0.19,1.31,5.43,10.49,2.43,1.31,1.87,1.12,2.62,2.25,2.43,0.56,1.31,0.37,3.37,0.75,0.37,0,2.25,8.43,2.06,1.5,3.37,1.12,0.75,10.86,5.24,1.5,22.1,1.87,9.36,11.42,1.31,3,0.94,0,0,0.56,0.56,0.19,0,0.19,0.19,0,16.85,9.36,2.81,0,0,0,0,0.37,0.37,2.43,1.5,0

Am I allowed to still have feelings for this guy when I’m working with the DA to resolve our domestic violence incident? I believe he has no intention of speaking to me again and that’s ok, but I miss him. Last we spoke, he yelled at me for an hour over the phone about how I’m not being supportive. If he’s convicted of a felony, that’s a life-ruiner.
I was initially standing by him (silently, because from day one he was unapologetic and it ate at me, but it’s easier to agree with him than to not), but day after day of hearing him blame the police for kicking down his door (I was legit screaming for help) and insinuating I’m also partially responsible (for calling 911), I just can’t support the bullshit and I’m now doing what I can to assist the DA. He’s gotten angrier and more resentful every time the case is brought up and I think he needs help.

When he got drunk and passed out in the bathroom in front of their kids, she went to check on him and he kicked the door shut, wedging her head between the door and the door frame. 
She is desperate to get out. We were messaging, as I had to plan and arrange a “surprise” divorce on my husband. I was the only one who had done so thing like this and we immediately bonded and I was telling her everything I did. She was sending me videos and recordings of his abuse and even though we were careful and deleting everything, he found all our texts on her iWatch. We didn’t know they still saved on that device. Now, she is forbidden to talk to me and I have heard from her once during this pandemic. Once. 
Are there any apps we can download and text with or call with? I want her to get ahold of me anytime, day or night and I want our messages to be locked and secured. 
Also, what steps can I take to help her? They are very, VERY, well off and he is very controlling. She can’t just go see an attorney. He controls 100% of the finances. What did I do?

fwzhhq,"Years after 2 separate abusers, and I'm still suffering","This is probably going to be long, and I apologize if this isn't the right place to post this and will delete if that's the case. I just have been needing to put this all out there for some time now and I can't think of better place. So here we go

SO I(27m) recently entered a relationship with my best friend (27m) for over a decade, it's also my first healthy relationship. It's been great, except for the fact that it's been bringing up a lot of things from my past relationships that I'd been able to just brush off in the past. My first long term boyfriend of 5 years got me to move to another country for him(i would go back and fourth roughly a dozen times, which my family paid for almost all of despite his family being rich), coerced me into cutting myself off from nearly everyone I knew to the point of starting fights with my friends on facebook. He would always berate me for being lazy, greedy, whatever he could think of to make me feel bad for not doing everything while also never giving me any opportunities to be more. He pretended to want to help me improve my art only to yell at me and belittle me when i didn't get something right the first time. 

But that's just the tip of the iceberg, he constantly made me feel inadequate in bed, forcing me to take a roll I told him from the beginning I wasn't comfortable with, he would tell me almost every time that I was bad, that I was doing something wrong, he'd get angry at me even though I was a virgin when him and I started dating. Not only that, but he took that and used it to try and convince me that I was a rapist. It got to the point where we never even had sex, which he also would use to start fights. Fuck, he'd use literally *anything* to start a fight, to the point where people we'd only just meant would comment on it, his own *friends* would say shit about it. And despite it all even after he hit me in the fucking face, I was vulnerable and desperate enough that i still *married* this man. 

He cheated on me, he pushed every boundary he could and when I tried to stand up for myself he'd scream at me for literal *hours*. He tried to force me into a poly relationship because I wasn't good enough, because no matter what I did I'd *never* be good enough. I spent so much time planning to kill myself, because if that was what my life was supposed to be than i Just didn't want to deal with it anymore.  

So then comes boyfriend number two, who i met while I was still married. I mentioned that if my husband had a second boyfriend I could also have one. He of course was pissed as hell and threw a tantrum. This new guy actually brought up how ex-husband treated me, and it hit me then that I needed to get out, and I needed to get out *now*. This lead me to making a huge mistake, moving into this new boyfriend's house after just a week decision. (stupid I know)

 At first, everything is great, I get a divorce (which i was forced to pay for) new guy tells me he's gonna teach me how to tattoo, I think I've finally made it. Except of course that wasn't the case. I went from being around someone all the time to literally only seeing my boyfriend for maybe a few hours after he got home, during which he pretty much never wanted to talk to me, he never showed really any interest in my art or well, in anything i wanted to talk about. He would get on my case about not cooking even though when I would make us something he would just order in anyway. And it only got worse over time, and eventually the fights started. 

It all came to a head when, after opening up a relationship sexually because just like the last time, he wanted something *more,* he accused me of cheating. Except he *didn't*, he didn't tell me what i did wrong he just kept repeating 'you know what you did' even though I didn't, because I hadn't cheated on him. I was so miserable, I was so lonely, I felt at that time I had nothing to live for, so after begging him for the tenth time to talk to me, I grabbed my pills and the Jack and went to just put an end to it all. 

Suddenly that was apparently enough to get him to tell me what was going on, and of course he apologized like they always do after something like this, and being the broken person that I was, we stayed together for several more months after that before I finally couldn't do it. I had come back to the states because I just couldn't keep not working, and in no time he'd grown possessive out of nowhere, mad that we didn't talk enough when he barely ever talked to me, mad that I talked about my friends or my art. I was done. 

It's crazy, how just these two people could so completely break any level of confidence that I'd had. I'm still trying to fight the effects of these two people, the self loathing, the paranoia that my current boyfriend is too good for me or will get tired of me when he sees how useless I am. The fear that maybe they were right and I'm just truly *unlovable*. It's hard to even properly express it all honestly, both when happened and how bad I am because of it.  I've been diagnosed with some pretty severe ptsd and am trying to work through it all, but it's so hard and there's *so much*.

And what maybe fucks me up the most? Is that my ex husband is still out there, he's even pretty popular, but I'm too terrified to ever actually call him out, and from what I've heard, he doesn't think he did anything wrong and even actively tried to make me look like the abuser. 

My new boyfriend has been wonderful, has known about the baggage I come with, but he loves me anyway.  And as hard as it is, I just have to keep hoping things will get better.",vxrmxn,2020-04-07 21:10:23,2,1104,14.77,30.27,71.77,5.49,26.93,12.41,96.38,64.4,23.19,15.4,10.51,0.54,0.18,3.99,0.18,7.79,4.08,14.13,10.42,9.87,7.79,2.54,20.38,4.26,2.36,2.54,1.27,2.45,6.79,2.45,4.35,0.63,2.26,0.45,11.32,0.72,1.18,0,5.16,15.13,1.54,2.26,2.72,3.62,2.54,3.62,1.45,0.36,0.36,0.72,1.72,0.36,0.45,0.63,0.27,9.69,3.17,2.36,2.08,2.36,0.63,7.79,8.97,1,15.49,2.17,5.43,7.88,0.72,0.72,0.45,0.54,0.09,0.09,1.09,0.54,0.09,0,0.09,0.18,15.85,3.53,5.43,0,0,0.09,0,0.09,0,3.99,0.91,1.81
fwzncf,Advice about leaving an abusive partner while I'm 12 weeks pregnant!,"Hi, so I'm 22 female and my partner is 25 male. I'm 12 weeks pregnant and I found out my partner was talking to other girls and I brought this to light and he told me he never loved me and is only with me for my kid, I said that's all I needed to hear and was going to try and leave when he grabs me and  starts beating me with his phone on my head. The phone ends up cracking and breaking and he blamed me for breaking his phone and that's when he starts punching me in the head, I went into fetal position to protect the baby and I hit him to get him to stop. His beautiful black lab dog had gotten on the bed to bite him, and he ended up punching the sweetest dog and I started hitting him in the chest because he punched his dog and needed him to top but then he kicked me in the stomach and started choking me and that's when I backed down because I could tell I was losing oxygen quicky, I was in fear for the baby.  I kept repeatedly asking if I may please  leave and he said I can't leave because he's scared I'm going or calling the cops. He won't allow me to leave and now I'm in fear for the health of mine and the baby's health. I have bruises on my face/temple , head, and neck. I actually couldn't control the shaking I was experiencing, and that has never happened to me before, I believe I was genuinely so scared. Does anyone have an advice? Not just leave but a plan, he's asleep right now, but I'm scared if he heard me try to leave he will beat me or hurt the unborn baby. 

 I'm genuinely scared and just want to have a safe exit without being harmed and even then if I leave I'm nervous he will have someone hurt me or he will do it himself.

fx7svk,Am I Just Being Paranoid or Are My Feelings Warranted?,"
So I blocked my psychologically abusive ex but I still have a hard time with dealing with the idea that even though he didn't believe he will hurt his future partners, I strongly suspect that he will.

Before I cut off contact when I still trying to remain friends:

- He admitted to barking like a dog to a female co-worker to ""dominate"" her because his mom wasn't responding the way he wanted her to.
- He was trying to reassure me that he wasn't going to shoot up a Walmart.
- He found it cathartic after he had a dream about nearly drowning one of my closest guy friends
- He admitted to being attracted to children in addition to being gay.

After I cut it off:

- He joked on a public internet forum about how he would buy guns from Walmart off of someone (bantering with the individual).

- He joked on a public internet forum about how sometimes he feels like ""killing everyone"".

*I highly doubt that he will shoot up a public place but I am disturbed by his joking due to his poor track record  with his friends (he only has online friends and long-distance partners), family, and intimate partners.",Super_Initiative,2020-04-08 07:50:54,27,211,51.63,89.1,8.59,5.52,26.38,21.33,89.57,58.77,20.85,17.06,6.16,0,0,10.9,0,3.79,5.21,16.59,8.06,6.64,5.21,1.42,12.32,3.79,2.84,1.42,0.47,0,7.58,2.84,4.74,1.42,1.42,0.47,23.22,0.95,4.27,1.9,10.43,12.8,3.79,1.42,0.95,3.32,0.47,3.32,1.9,0,0,1.9,0.47,0,0,0.47,0,8.53,4.27,1.42,2.84,0,0.47,4.74,3.32,2.37,11.37,0.47,6.16,4.74,0.95,2.37,0.47,0.95,0,0.95,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,15.64,3.32,1.42,0.95,0,0.47,0,3.79,1.9,1.42,1.9,0.47
fx8mag,My friend is being abused,"my friend recently confided in me that her fiancé had ‘smacked’ her in the face because he had gotten angry that she went out for drinks with me without telling him.. 

She did tell him where she was going though I was literally there when she said it he was just angry that she dident reply to his messages that night very quickly. He honestly messaged her every 2 minutes and if she sat there and replied to them all she wouldn’t have had time to do ANYTHING else. 

I was so disgusted when she told me this I tried to convince her to leave him but she refused. 

We’ve been friends for years but since that night we’ve become a little distant and I 100% believe it is because of him. 

She’s afraid of him. She dident say that but it is very obvious. She gets all quiet and shy when I bring up how much of an asshole he is or how she use to be so happy before she was with him and she just shuts down and changes the subject 

He talks to her like she’s a dog. Even in public he’ll yell at her, call her dumb etc she dosent say anything back to him which is very unlike her usual self ( this girl use to pour drinks on people who were rude to her) 

I imagine he does much worse when they’re alone and no one is around. 

She dosent do anything about it. It’s like she’s just fallen asleep and doesn’t care about how bad he treats her anymore. 

It’s the worst feeling to see my friend treated like trash and even worse to see her just take it and not even try to stand up for herself. And then even worse when she looks genuinely terrified when I stand up for her and tell him to stfu or I tell him to stop demanding things of her. 

One time I was over at her house and she broke down in tears because he’d burnt all her dresses and told her they were too ‘slutty’ for her to wear. 

I’m so ENRAGED I want to rip this guys balls off so bad I honestly don’t understand what he’s done to her because she’s just anxious and afraid of upsetting him all of the time. Which is not her personality at all. 

I’m worried she’s going to keep distancing herself from me just to make him happy and she’s going to be left isolated and alone with him.

I want my friend back. Or even for her to just be happy again... this whole situation is breaking my damn heart 

I’ve tried to get her help. I texted her domestic violence helpline numbers after she had told me he hit her in the face. She told me not to send that kind of stuff because he reads her texts and would be upset if he seen it. 

She knows she can text me anytime and I’ll call the police on his ass and I’d come pick her up and she is always welcome to stay at my house for however long she needs to. 

She knows I’d always help her with anything but she won’t do it she’s so controlled by him she does everything he wants. It makes me so sad.",Visible-Leg,2020-04-08 08:36:20,1,562,5.87,89.66,1,1,21.62,11.21,95.02,65.3,28.47,22.6,5.87,0.36,0,16.01,0.36,5.87,1.6,13.52,11.03,7.47,9.43,1.6,21,4.98,1.78,2.49,0.71,1.6,6.94,1.25,5.69,1.42,1.6,1.07,23.84,0,1.07,11.21,5.34,11.57,1.6,2.85,1.42,2.14,1.78,3.02,1.96,0.71,0.89,0.36,2.14,1.25,0.36,0.18,0.36,6.94,2.49,0.53,2.31,0.71,1.25,6.05,13.35,1.42,11.92,2.14,5.34,5.16,0.18,0.36,0.53,0,0,0,1.07,1.07,0.18,0,0,0,10.85,4.98,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0.36,4.8,0.36,0.18

fxc2pd,"My dad (53M) just hit me(22F), I don't know what to do","Hello, 

I need some advice, my parents abusive, and have been for a long time. I moved away to go to university but because of Corona I had to come back. Usually I would stay in my university's town during the summer semester for work, because I wanted to get away from the violence and their nasty personalities in general. 

Anyway what I feared happened today, my dad hit me. I think it was because I wasn't paying attention to him and because I didn't move when he wanted me to. I actually did defend myself though, I kicked him in the balls...which made him madder. Anyway, I ended up running to my room, locking the door and crying to my boyfriend, who is the only one in my life that knows that my parents are physically abusive towards me.  

I don't know what to do now. I could go back to my university as I have a place their still, but no food. I'm on a student budget so I don't know if I can afford to get groceries.  My place is also in a student condo, and is an high risk area for Corona. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to live like this. 

I know it doesn't matter that much, but I have one other question, which is kinda related:

Why didn't my boyfriend offer to help me ? Or to take me in....I guess it doesn't matter.

fxmcc7,advice?,"Ever since I was around 7 years old, i was raised in a abusive/DV household. I am turning 20 soon. I know it sounds crazy, but i didn't know ""domestic violence"" was a thing and how common it was until a couple years ago. Ever since I was young, whenever my mom and her husband would argue/fight, it would get violent. I'm sure he has anger management issues because he gets angry over small topics/conflicts. My mom's husband would yell like a psycho. He would threaten us, break things, harm himself, or harm others including my mom. I am not the only child in this household by the way.  Luckily, we have some voice recordings of some of their fights in case the police gets involved. I've been verbally and physically abused by my mom's husband when i was younger. Whenever they would fight, i would feel helpless, I wouldn't know what to do. The only thing I could is just cry because i'm sensitive, easily an anxious, and weak.. I know the first thing I should do is call the cops, but i can't get myself to do it.. i don't know if it's because i'm afraid of her husband or i'm afraid that the cops won't help for some reason or maybe it's a mixture of both. I really want to get some type of help and be in a better place because this is negatively impacting my mental health and how I perform in school. Growing up, my mom didn't care about how i felt and she thinks that it's normal to be in a situation like this. I guess it's because her husband will act nice to her again, so she's okay with it. She thinks that he will change despite everything he has done. She would tell me ""just look at it as a normal thing, no family is perfect"" but i refused.

fxzkvi,The lockdown ultimatum,"Should I just marry him?

Gotta keep this short and delete quickly as he will be home from the grocery store soon.

My abuser is taking advantage of this pandemic to force me into marriage with him, which I have told m repeatedly I don’t want. I had a plan to leave last month but of course Rona has to ruin all that. He is asking me every day can we get married today and I always tell him I’m not ready and then he gives me the silent treatment for awhile but yesterday he snapped back at me and said that I was treading a very dumb path and that I better get my head on straight by the end of the month or then there would be consequences, and it would “beehoove” (idk how to spell that I hate that word but it’s his favorite to use on me when he’s telling me what to do) me to do it sooner rather than later.

I’m pretty sure this means hell start making my life a living hell more and more the longer I put this off so even if I can hold out until the end of the month and IF lockdown is over by then, it still means I’m gonna have to get theough a whole lot of punishing and who knows if I will even have the will to leave after that. I also think if I say no to marriage then he will take away everything and kick me out with no phone, car, or supplies and tell me to go if I want to go so bad. That’s what he always does because he says he owns everything in this house because he bought the house and I haven’t put in as much money to everything as he does so if I don’t want him then I have to give up everything he does for me too.

Anyway I’m starting to think if I just go along with it then he’ll be happy for awhile (honeymoon phase literally) and I can actually survive this lockdown and then worry about divorce later. I’m thinking this is safer and that getting divorced would be easier than being homeless during the pandemic but I don’t know, what do you think? Are there ways this could backfire one me?",the_bad_joke,2020-04-09 13:04:49,25,394,11.78,26.28,65.25,25.77,32.83,10.66,94.16,64.97,22.59,14.97,10.15,0.25,0.25,4.31,0,7.61,3.81,12.94,11.93,5.84,11.93,2.03,23.35,5.08,3.81,1.78,0.25,1.78,4.57,2.28,2.28,0.25,1.52,0.25,10.91,1.78,0,0,4.57,13.45,2.03,1.78,4.06,2.79,2.28,4.82,1.27,0,1.27,0,1.02,0.25,0.51,0,0.25,6.09,1.52,1.02,1.27,2.03,0.76,1.52,17.26,4.31,14.72,2.54,4.06,8.63,0.25,0,0.76,0.76,0.51,0,1.78,0.76,0.76,0,0,0.51,9.14,2.03,1.52,0,0,0.76,0,0,0.51,3.3,1.02,0

fy6q4p,I believe that my mom is married to a domestic violence abuser. Please help!,"I’m not sure if this is the right thread, but if it isn’t, I would greatly appreciate it if I’m directed to the proper thread. Also please excuse my English as it is not my first language. 

A bit of background information for you:

My dad passed away one year ago unexpectedly. The whole ordeal was extremely hard on both me and my family. Most of us were able to get through the grieving process, but my mom never really fully recovered I think. After about three months after my father passed away, my mom started talking to some person that she met on Facebook. The guy claimed to be from Vietnam and they even Facetimed a few times. Initially I was a bit worry myself that she was moving on a little too fast. She was still emotionally vulnerable as she was still visibly grieving my father passing away. She would still talk about how much she wished that she was with him, how she wished that she was the one who passed away rather than my father, etc.

Strangely she would often have similar conversations with the Vietnamese guy friend as well. Even though she would heavily talk about my father on the phone with this guy, he still proceed her romantically. He would often sweet talk her and it did have an effect on her mental well being. She was finally going back to her normal self. Though after I found out that she was sending money to him (a few hundred dollars I can’t remember the exact amount) I brought up how she was being scammed. I told her she was being taken advantage of and that she should see a therapist for help, but she rejected the idea completely because she wasn’t “crazy.” She told me that she prayed a lot about the guy and that she had a ‘good feeling about him.’ Eventually the two of them fell out due to minor religious differences.

About a month after falling out with the Viennese guy, my mom told me that she signed up for a dating website, were she can meet people that have similar religious beliefs as her. Less than a week after signing up, she ‘matched’ with a guy. While he initially seemed nice and I did talk to him on the phone a few times, he eventually revealed to my mom that he was currently in prison. Apparently he has a violent past, though it didn’t go as far as killing anyone. My mom seemed attracted to him regardless of his violent past, stating that he asked God for forgiveness and he has repented for his sins.

I was obviously mad at this point with my mom’s decision as the guy could be obviously lying to her. The guy’s been in prison for over 25 years, and there was no way of telling if he actually had a change of heart. After about two weeks of talking, they eventually got engaged. I told my mom that this whole situation was crazy. One of the early signs of domestic abuse is moving the relationship along too fast. Obviously getting engaged in less than two weeks of knowing someone is a red flag, in my opinion. I eventually ended up talking my grandma of the whole situation hoping that she’ll be able to talk some sense into my mom. Which she somehow managed to do. I have no idea what my grandma told my mom, but it managed to work as she eventually ended up cutting ties with the prison guy.

Less then a week after breaking up with the guy from prison, my mom started talking to another guy. Though this guy was one of my dad’s old friends. They were initially close, though they did grew a little distant after me, my dad, mom, and little brother moved to east coast. About two weeks after cutting it off with the prison guy, my mom gets engaged to my dad’s old friend. They got married after three weeks of reconnecting with each other and he moved into our home shortly after they got married.

Of course when I met him I was suspicious of his motives and past history. Of course this guy had a shady past of his own. One evening I heard my mom’s husband talking on the phone with a friend. My mom’s husband mentions that he didn’t attend his court date because he just moved into our home. I brought up what he said to my mom, and my mom shrugged it off. Saying that he didn’t pay a traffic ticket, though I do not believe that is the case. I tried reaching out to some of my dad’s old friends and expressed the whole situation up until that point. One of his friends did mention that the police were looking for him in another state due to domestic violence charges due to him harming his previous wife. He is still wanted for that crime on the west coast, and as far as I can tell the police have no idea that he is half way across the country. To top things off, my mom’s new husband is also buying drugs in mines, my brother’s, and my father’s last name. (Ex: let says that my last name is Smith, he’ll order the drugs, have them sent through the mail, and last “The Smith Family” as the recipients of the package.) My mom does not have the same last name as me, my brother, or my late father legally. My mom is aware of his actions, though it seems like she is supporting him none the less. When I initially stumbled upon the first package, I throw away the contents of the package as I know that my grandparents had problems with drugs in the past. Though I guess both my mom and her husband figured out that the package has been delivered as they started questioning me about the whereabouts of the package.

I tried bringing the situation up to my grandmother, hoping that she will intervene but she thinks that I’m blowing things out of proportion, even though she is fully aware of my mom’s history when it comes to finding a romantic partner. I want to convince my grandma that most of the things that have been going on is true, but she mentions that she needs proof before we can even do anything. I looked online and was able to find a case number that is connected to my mom’s husband on a state county court record database, however it does not list the specific crime that he is wanted for. It only shows up as a criminal charge. I don’t know how my mom managed to convince my grandma that the charge is for a traffic ticket, but I pretty sure that it is for the domestic violent issue that he had in his previous marriage.

I need all of the help I can get, as I’m not sure what to do next. I want to go to the police and try to see if they can actually verify if he is wanted, but my mom will noticed if I leave the house. She’ll be able to tell that I’m the one who reported him to law enforcement and I’m pretty sure she’ll try kicking me out for it. Is there anyway that I can look up if someone has a criminal history free of charge online? I tried a few sites, though most of them require a payment of some sort. Being that I’m inside of school still, I don’t exactly have a job to pay for the results.

fydrnj,Should I inform the parents of my ex-boyfriend that he has hit me once to prevent future violence to others?,"I have been watching the domestic violence statistics rise and have been watching documentaries about it which has left me wondering whether I should inform the parents of my ex that he has hit me once. I still have their phone numbers, after I left him a couple of years ago they even sent me a message that they were going to miss me. I know for a fact that he did not tell them about it when it happened and he threatened me so I would not tell them, so I am pretty sure that they do not know. I also think they think he is a perfect person who would never do such a thing. I was wondering if me telling them would maybe make them discuss it or more watchful when he enters a new relationship, which might help prevent someone else from getting hit.

About the situation when he hit me, I was crying and wanted to leave his apartment to go to my own because he was mad and screaming at me for a joke he didn't like, he didn't know how to handle it so he hit me to make it stop and make me stay. He was raging. I asked for permission to go to the toilet and was allowed, but instead I immediately fled to his roommates room, woke him up and asked him to protect me while I called my parents. The roommate thankfully waited with me until they arrived and escorted me downstairs to their car. After the incident I stayed in the relationship until I had found a safe way out, that I was looking for since the moment this happened. Although he initially apologized for the incident, he did say that he found it my own fault and pretty much thought he couldn't have done anything otherwise in the situation, which was, and is, bizarre to me and makes me think this could definitely happen again with someone else.

I have not spread stories about him or anything, I have only discussed this with my closest friends and family. I am currently in a very happy long-term relationship. The purpose of telling his parents is also definitely not to make him look bad, but to help prevent such incidents in the future with new people in new relationships. However, I am uncertain whether it will make me look like a bitter ex, whether it will lead to him telling negative stories about me in our shared community (which can impact my career and education as he works in a similar field) or even him looking me up to confront me about telling them. I am also whether it will have any positive impact at all.

fyfvmw,My sister may be getting abused and my family make me feel crazy for wanting to get police involved.,"My sister is dating an ex con which is something my family and i are not happy with. At first he didn’t seem bad at all, he was friendly with me and seemingly so to my sister. However my sister has told me several times that he used to get in terrible moods out of jealousy when he hears about my sisters past boyfriends. 

My sister just came to our door 20 minutes ago bawling her eyes out saying that he had hit her and punched her because of an argument fuelled by his jealousy again. She was in a state. My mom demanded my sister give her his number. She then called him and demanded to know the situation, he denied any claim of abuse despite my sister repeating that he had hit her. He was apparently crying but i grew up in a semi abusive household myself, crying was a common form of manipulation to gain sympathy. My mom gave him a warning even though i was demanding she got the police involved so that if my sister was not telling the whole truth then it can be properly sorted. After the call, my sister was crying saying that she loved him and that calling him made everything worse and that we shouldn’t get the police involved. She then stormed out and drove off still crying. My mom and stepdad just left the situation at that and went back to their day almost as if nothing had happened. 

This completely frustrated me so then i began shouting at them for acting like nothing happened and that we should take things like this more seriously because i have heavily studied domestic violence in the past and have heard dozens of stories where violence turns to murder. They then made me feel like i was crazy by wanting more done and then my mom patronised me by saying im just a child and that i know nothing about domestic abuse. We had an argument about it and i just stormed off to my room where i am now typing this. Before i hopped on Reddit to type this i text my sister asking her what really happened but she hasn’t responded. Am i over reacting? Am i wrong for wanting the police involved? Should i just drop it? Please i really need advice.

fyn486,Why is it called victim blaming?,"If I hang out with a bunch of no good goons and something happens to me it will be my fault for choosing to befriend such people. But if a woman does it and gets abused it’s not acceptable to say “told you so” because it’s comes off as victim blaming. Why is this?

I’ll give you an example. 

If I hang out with guys who are known to be gang members and one day I get arrested in the wrong place at the wrong time, it’s my fault. Fair enough. 

But if a woman dates Cris Brown after it’s known that he beat Rihanna, it won’t be appropriate to say “you should have know”.

fyo0cj,I am scared of my ex-Fiancé,"I posted this over at r/relationships but it got removed because of trolls. So I decided to post it here. Thank you for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

hey. I don't know where else to post. I don't know what to do. I will try to keep this as short as possible.

This week I(f,22) finally broke up with my abusive fiancé(m,27). We've been together for only a few months.I fell in love with him because he understood me and we had a lot in common. and even moved to his country for a while. He was perfect in the beginning, made me happy but a few weeks after we started dating, he started being abusive. He shouted at me every single day, told me what that everything I do is wrong and used me for sex. Right now he is in my country. He has been here for 2 months and on Monday I finally kicked him out of my apartment. I booked an airbnb for him and bought him groceries for a few days. I tried to keep the contact to the minimum.

It started Monday night. He kept texting me, calling me names, calling my mom in the middle of the night, threatening to kill himself because of me. Then today, his friend texted me that he thinks my ex bought heroine. (he has a long history of abuse but never did heroine). I unblocked my ex and saw that he sent me videos of him trashing the airbnb. It is in my name so I decided to give in and show up there. He wasn't at home. (or was and just passed out cause of the H?). There is another thing. A few days ago, he texted me, threatening to beat me up. He was never the violent type but he is in an emotional state where I dont know if I can trust him to do nothing. I locked my doors, closed all of my windows. I am just done with this. When I was walking home, I thought about everything and came to the conclusion that I won't cry over him anymore. I want to be done with this. but should I be threatened? what if he killed himself over me?

I dont even know anymore what I am scared of. that he is dead? that he is going to come to my place? should I go to the police? should I call the ambulance to see if he's alive? I blocked him every where and right now im just sitting at home, unable to think of a solution for this. fuck

I know this is all over the place but I am really confused right now.

TL;DR: ex fiance is threatening to kill himself and to beat me up if he sees me. I am worried but also scared. do I call the police?",AbjectDust,2020-04-10 13:27:03,3,493,26.8,38.81,83.21,1.94,11.2,12.17,95.54,63.69,24.75,19.27,11.97,0.61,0.2,6.49,0,5.48,4.67,14.2,9.74,5.27,6.9,1.83,19.47,4.26,0.81,1.62,0.81,2.23,5.68,1.42,4.26,1.83,2.43,0.41,13.39,0.41,0.61,0.61,6.69,10.55,2.64,1.42,1.62,1.83,2.03,3.04,1.22,1.01,0.2,0,1.22,0,0.41,0.41,0.2,7.51,2.43,1.22,3.45,0.41,1.22,7.71,10.75,0.81,17.24,2.03,8.11,6.49,0.61,0.41,1.22,0.41,0,1.01,1.42,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,16.43,7.51,2.84,0.2,0.61,1.62,0,0.2,0,1.22,1.62,0.61

After living in fear everyday of my life and realizing this is not okay I was able to leave but it wasn't easy. It was so hard. I tried and failed so many times before. Even now I question my sanity because the pieces of me are so broken. I am in a secure location for now but wish I could move farther away but the law will not allow me too at this time. I understand why but it also feels like the system is failing me. It took me so much courage to get here and now I can't take the steps I want to feel secure.

fz2fj5,2 toddlers with autism and a 26 year age gap.,"Me (23f) and my kid's (2m &amp; 3f both w autism) dad (48m) have been through it all it seems. 

He's hit me, kicked me, choked me, held me at gunpoint, made me get out of the car in the middle of nowhere... We've been together 5 years. 

I've called the cops (which led to cps getting involved due to the violence towards me, he's never been abusive towards them; he loves them more than anything.) They don't see the fights, but I don't know how much longer I'll be able to control that. 

I've applied to domestic violence shelters and been put on waiting lists, I've gone to stay with family... I've even broken up with him and slept with other people. 

I keep ending up right back here with him. I don't understand what's wrong with me. 

Why am I so stupid? Why do I love him so fucking much? I know about trauma bonds and stuff; I see a therapist... I just can't put that knowledge into practice for some reason.

fz70wq,"US citizen trapped with abuser overseas, please help me","My husband and I have been together for 20 years and married for 16.5 years. I am 33. My husband has always been emotionally abusive and manipulative, but since we've moved overseas (non military) it's escalated. It's now physically and sexually abusive as well. I don't have family, I was emancipated from the foster care system at 16. He's been the only family I've had for the past 20 years. It's just gotten to the point I can't handle it.

We moved to the middle east for his job 8 years ago. He's adopted a very controlling attitude since we've come here. I am not allowed access to money, to house or car keys, to my identification or my passport (he stores these at work when he caught me trying to take them). I'm not allowed to leave the house (he locks me in), to have friends, or to work. He recently let me have a phone after a fire broke out in our garage and I had no way to call for help, but it's got spyware and a keylogger on it and most websites and apps are restricted so I don't use it much. 

I take his phone sometimes when he's sleeping deeply, which usually happens after he rapes me. I have tried to search for information to help me in incognito mode. I was able to contact local authorities once and they told me that I'm his wife so he can do whatever he wants with me. Basically for the last 8 years I've been trapped and I'm worried I'll never get out.

It's gotten to the point I'm just thinking about killing myself to escape. I just want out. I haven't been able to find anyone to help me and I'm wondering if anyone in the US knows any organizations that could help get me out please? I'm desperate. At this point I'll try anything.

fz8fqm,Looking for advice or opinions on my current situation,"I need reassurance somehow that I’m thinking clearly about a decision to leave my boyfriend. 

A little backstory... I was in an abusive relationship for almost 5 years. It started out with just verbal abuse, isolating me from friends and family then escalated over time to physical abuse. We have two children together so I found it difficult to leave. I was a new mom and scared, but when he tried to strangle me that was the breaking point. This relationship ended about 3 years ago.

I was extremely hurt, and embarrassed about having to start my life over. I had to move back in with my parents at that time until I got back on my feet. Within about 8 months I moved into a new place, started going to therapy and felt great. Around that time I bumped into an old male friend. We ended up hooking up a few times, but it turned into a really close friendship. I wouldn’t call it a FWB because once we got close we weren’t intimate. He was just a really great friend who I trusted. He was super supportive and I enjoyed his company. I made it clear I wasn’t nearly ready for anytime of relationship, and he understood that. Now over the past two years he’s been over for every holiday, birthday, etc. He was my best friend. The end of 2019, feelings started to change and we decided to give a relationship a try. I felt after 3 years I could handle having a relationship. 

Everything was great until I started having some PTSD from the past abusive relationship. Disagreements occurred and I would breakdown because in my mind I was so used to things escalating quickly. I would get scared and leave during arguments because I didn’t want something bad to happen. After talking through it and addressing some trigger moments, he again was supportive and understood. It’s only been 6 months into this relationship and now during arguments he’s starting to get aggressive. He whipped a coffee cup off the table during talking, a week later he spit in my face, then when I tried to leave he ripped my purse off me and it ripped in half. 

I know that I have trauma issues. I know that I’m not perfect, but I’m not screaming or throwing things or exhibiting any behaviors like that. My move is to escape. I always leave when I feel like it’s escalating. I can’t handle the stress when someone’s angry I get scared and overwhelmed. Am I wrong for wanting to break up with him? I feel like I can’t trust my judgement anymore. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or if these behaviors are red flags and I’m making the right choice.

fzfsuv,Their desire is my trigger,"Posted this in r/rapecounseling but got no response. Thought maybe I'd get some here. 

Quick backstory: My(F) first BF was sexually and psychologically abusive. I had no previous sexual experience before him other than some attempted rapes and sexual assaults with people I was getting to know. I knew him for a year before our relationship started and it went from heaven to hell real quick. So basically, I am today diagnosed with C-PTSD which I've been in treatment for during the past year. Before that I was bouncing from one abusive situation to another... Not knowing I even had boundaries. But I have come a great way and now feel ready to maintain healthy romantic relationships.

I have started dating again, and I have noticed a problem that keep coming up with each new guy... It is like a bad circle which I wish to break. So I am really attracted to the guy and after weeks of getting to know eachother we have sex. Then usually he wants and initiates sex again, which causes me to enter a FAWNing state/dissociation. He does not notice this... (only one guy I've dated noticed and took precautionary messures from that point on. The others seem to not understand why I cannot just say no, and keep expecting me to do so). Afterwards I am in full blown dissociation. I feel less safe with him after that, so my libido plummets. And he initiates again, repeating the previous scene of events, and so it goes in a circle. Each time he does not see me... I lose trust. And in the end I leave the relationship because it is hurting me and I don't feel seen or understood.

How do I not get triggered by them wanting me and initiating? How do I stay present enough to say no? How much can I expect from a partner when it comes to patience and accommodation for my mental health?

I have applied to meet a sexologist for these issues and have also stopped having sex until I've been in counselling with one. But because of covid-19 everything is delayed, and I cannot find any information on this specific issue online. Thought reddit might have someone who knows? Anyone else who has had similar problems?

fzijk8,Just feel like letting it out,"Hey, it’s not really about getting an answer or solution cause Idk if there’s one really, I just felt like letting this out somewhere, so it feels like I told someone. My parents are alcoholic, and they have been fighting and hitting on each other for a very long time now. I was already separating them when I was a kid. I’m 24 now, but the struggle is still the same. I’m happy that I’m here to at least protect my little sister from this, she’s 15. Were quite used to getting in between them and get hit as well, we try to protect our mom from our dad. She also has her wrongs, for disrespecting him and insulting him the whole day. But then he gets angry and actually hit on us, and the house is in literally in pieces. With the confining it’s not getting better, and as I’m writing this the insults are still going on but at least the violence have stopped. I just felt like letting this out somewhere, where people can understand me. I usually don’t live in this house anymore, but my sister still does at the moment. I’m afraid that when we all leave the house, if they’re still together, the fight still go on and that they kill each other one day. They’re not people who talk with each other, or talk about feelings. We tried to tell them many time, but it didn’t really work out. I just wanted to let that out here, even if it’s not read tbh. 

I feel like nobody deserves to go through this, so I also wanted to bring my support to the other victims of domestic violence, with whom I relate with.

fzkf1c,LGBT bf is violent,"My bf gets kind of violent whenever I try to move away from him. 

So it’s like If he hugs me I have to immediately give him attention even if I’m busy doing something otherwise he starts yelling at me grabbing my face and pushing me around/usually onto the ground. He yells things like ‘why dident you hug me back’ ‘effing bitch’ etc 

We have sexual interactions a lot but again he gets violent if I’m not 100% enthusiastic and paying attention to what he’s doing. It’s to the point where I feel I have to pretend to enjoy certain things or else he’ll start having a fit about it.

Sometimes he will randomly during some time of the day come up to me and demand to know why I haven’t been with him all day. He gets in my face and he’ll push me as he is talking to me. Most of the violence is him pushing me. He dosent hit or strike me. He has slapped me before but he dosent really do that anymore. He just pushes me into stuff or up against the wall or will shove me into the floor. 

One time he shoved me and I hit my back against the bookshelf corner so I shoved him back. Not very hard he dident even move. He retaliated by gripping my hair and spitting on my face. 

He yells a lot and he usually dosent stop unless I start crying. 

He wants all this attention as soon as he asks for it and gets angry if I take too long. But when I try to get his attention when he’s avoiding me he just ignores me! 

Why does he do this ?",longest_ride,2020-04-11 15:23:32,12,290,11.27,27.89,85.1,3.19,16.11,12.41,96.9,64.14,26.21,21.72,11.38,0.34,0.34,9.66,0,4.48,3.45,12.76,7.93,8.97,10,1.03,21.03,3.79,2.41,2.76,0.69,2.07,5.86,1.72,4.14,0.34,2.76,0.34,13.45,0,0.69,0,11.03,15.86,2.41,1.03,1.72,6.9,1.03,6.9,2.41,0,1.03,1.38,2.76,1.38,1.03,0.34,0,6.9,2.07,0.69,1.03,2.41,0.69,1.03,13.79,2.07,17.93,3.45,7.24,8.28,1.03,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,1.38,0.69,0.69,0,0,0,11.03,5.17,0,0,0,0.34,0.34,0,0.69,3.79,0,0.69
fzlf75,"Engaged, in love, but he has occasional violence/anger issues that scare me.","My fiance (38/m) of two years and I (32/f) get along well.  We've been dating and living together for 5 years. We have an affordable house together (in my name), and have shared finances in one account. He was married once before. We planned our tiny wedding in October, but due to Coronavirus we're just waiting until next year - we have not continued planning for 2021, so as to not have additional pressure/deadlines for it.

He doesn't handle fights well.  We both realize that sometimes you have to actually ""address"" things, but he would rather just not discuss, than actually handle. It is extremely frustrating because I am someone who needs to discuss/does not like to let things fester.  Like normal couples, we get on each other's nerves, and have basic arguments - but end up getting over them within minutes (normally by laughter).  He tells me that my ""need to discuss things multiple times and justify myself"" nature really bothers him.  But I don't argue for the sake of arguing. Sometimes we're petty arguers, but I think that can be expected in relationships.

About once a year (obviously it's not planned, this just happens to be the rough frequency) we get into an escalated fight where he punches a hole in the wall, or breaks a door off its hinges or throws and breaks something (one time it was a tablet, another time it was a dinner plate). He has never laid a finger on me - never threatened me - and I know he won't. He even tells me that he actively makes sure he will never hurt me. But his temper can skyrocket and all he can do is break something. So, when it happens I completely drop to immediate disaster prevention mode and try to be absolutely docile so that he will calm down. Once he does, I take a deep breath and the emotions hit me like a ton of bricks and I want out of the relationship. I absolutely do not want to stay those few minutes after the fight.  The feeling hangs with me for a day or so, then life just moves on.

I love the guy. And feel like he kind of needs me (his family members are POS's - He grew up in an extremely abusive home. His dad would beat his mom, and put his head through walls and doors. He ended up leaving and building himself up outside of his family, and has ""broken the mold"". He does know that his dad's mom suffered from schizophrenia. He vows never to ever lay a hand on anyone.). I've grown a lot during our relationship, and feel more confident in myself than ever before.  I've asked him about his anger before - but each time the blowout happens, I realize that I don't like how it makes me feel and I want out. It will continue to happen, he's not going to change without help. How can I approach him about seriously addressing his anger issues before we get married? Or, how do I know if those fits outweigh the best times we have, and do we need to call it quits?

Thanks for lending advice and opinions on this. 

TL;DR - Engaged, in love, but he has extreme violence/anger issues. I only see it about once a year (punching doors, throwing and destroying items), but when I do I want to run.. He's never threatened me nor hurt me. He chooses inanimate things on purpose. Other than that, we get along so great. Just don't know how to interpret my feelings.",holycanoli4,2020-04-11 16:24:38,14,613,26.24,66.43,55.69,7.15,15.72,17.62,92.66,58.4,20.55,14.85,6.2,2.45,0.16,5.87,0.16,5.71,4.24,12.89,8.16,6.85,8.48,2.94,16.8,4.08,2.28,1.31,1.79,1.63,7.67,2.94,4.57,0.65,3.1,0.49,15.82,1.63,0.33,0.33,6.53,15.17,2.45,1.63,2.28,2.45,2.61,5.06,1.96,0.16,0.16,1.63,2.12,0.82,0.65,0,0.16,10.44,5.38,1.31,2.61,1.79,0.65,1.96,13.21,1.31,16.31,1.96,6.69,7.67,0.33,0.33,1.31,0.65,0,0,0.65,0,0,0.33,0.33,0,19.9,6.36,4.57,0,0.16,0.33,0,1.14,0.98,2.77,2.61,0.98
fzoar1,Filing for Divorce- Police &amp; Domestic Violence,"I have been married for 18 months and I've finally gotten the courage to file for divorce. I left him a few months ago, basically fleeing my home state to go be with family elsewhere. On top of his cheating and alcohol issues, he was verbally and physically abusive. I have at least 30+ pictures of evidence (photos time stamped &amp; documenting the abuse). However, I never reported his abuse because he is a police officer. 


He was previously a special victims investigator and was recently promoted; he is very well respected within his patrol unit and his department. I received a call a few months after I left, from an investigator within his department. Apparently, they received an anonymous tip that he had been physically abusive and they were concerned for my safety and wanted to get more information. I wasn't comfortable at the time providing any info/making a statement, mostly due to being caught off guard, scared and knowing if I said something he would potentially get charged with multiple felonies and lose his job and any future career possibilities within law enforcement. I have 3 years to report the abuse before the statue of limitations is reached. He's been put on administrative leave pending termination but they haven't given him a reason why and I'm assuming it has something to do with this situation (although I fear there could be an investigation into something larger and this is just part of the discovery process). 

Now that I've established residency in another state, I'm filing for divorce and I have the option to file for on either grounds of abuse or irreconcilable differences. My initial thought was just to try and settle this as amicably as possible and file for irreconcilable differences (we have no children, no joint debt, no joint property, etc. plus I'm not asking for any spousal support or any part of his pension; which I could easily do and would most likely get awarded). I'm debating on filing based on the grounds of abuse. It doesn't feel right that he can go out and respond to calls of domestic violence but come home and abuse his own wife. At one point he even handcuffed me with his handcuffs while suffocating me with a pillow.. this memory alone makes it difficult for me to not want to hold him accountable in some type of way. If the divorce is filed on the grounds of abuse, he will not be criminally charged since the state I am in does not have jurisdiction but it would at least be documented somewhere and that gives me some sense of holding him accountable.

My attorney said it's completely up to me on how I want to file but I have mixed feelings on just choosing the easy route (irreconcilable differences) or taking it a step further/potentially getting dragged into a contested divorce, presenting evidence, etc. (grounds of abuse). Has anyone been through a similar situation?

fzpqa0,Left feeling like you're the one in the wrong,"I was abused both mentally and physically by my ex partner.
I left him after he physically assaulted me in a public place.
The only person who knows how bad it was in private is my ""best friend"". 
When the final incident that lead to me leaving happened, my best friend was there to witness and told me she was ""glad it happened"" so I could now feel like it was ok to leave, as everyone had now seen how bad things were.

Bit of back story, her husband grew up with my ex partner.
I was understanding that they maintained a friendship after everything, as they had known eachother most of their lives.
However, since the break up there has been a few incidents where I have been left feeling like I am the problem for leaving him. I've let these go and just tried to ignore it.
I never pressed charges against my ex and just tried to move on as I didn't feel mentally strong enough to deal with this.

However, tonight, while we are in lockdown (and not meant to be socialising with people outside our household), it has been posted on social media that my ex partner has spent the night drinking with my best friend and her husband.
I feel so hurt and betrayed, how can you be this comfortable around someone who treat your best friend this way?
Why after everything do I feel the one in the wrong, and left alone?
I feel I lost everything and he gained from this situation.
I am so hurt alone and dont know who to turn to.

Nearly a year after finally leaving, I feel as hurt, if not more.
I now feel I've lost my best friend to my abuser.
Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?

fzw5lz,"I called the police on my girlfriend, I’m having a very hard time coming to terms with what happened.","Our relationship was on the outs, we’d been sitting in isolation with each other for weeks driving each other crazy, and to top it all off, we were both drunk. Three days ago, I tried to talk about what we could do to salvage things and if not, how we could end it. She didn’t want to hear what I had to say, so she threatened to “come at me”.  Determined to have her listen to what I had to say, I continued talking. I wasn’t posturing, I wasn’t yelling, I was making an effort to be as calm about things as possible.

She punched me in the face and climbed on top of me, pinning my head down with her knee. I pushed her off of me, at which point she remarked that I was scared of her and that she could easily kill me in my sleep, that she would tell everyone I had tried to rape her. She started ripping my shirt, I put on another one, she ripped that one in half. She then grabbed a pair of scissors, and tried to stab me. It was at this point that I lashed out, I wrestled her onto the bed, punching her in the legs, grabbed the scissors, and put my hand around her throat. I let go, realizing what I had done, and moved to the side of the bed and started to cry. She started kicking me in the ribs. Telling me that I made her do all these things, that she’s only like this with me, that I deserve it. When I pointed out how crazy all this was, she spat on me. I spat back. I asked her if she had taken her medication, and she said it wouldn’t matter if she took it now, it would take three hours to kick in, so I might as well just let her sleep.

After she lied down, I desperately tried to find a way out. I moved away from my friends and family three years ago to be with her. I alienated myself from everyone else in my life for her. She could’ve just walked two blocks to her parents house, but It was me who had to find a place to stay at 3:00 AM. I couldn’t get a hold of my dad, so I tried my friend in another city, to see if their parents who live here could come and get me. It was at this point she got up, stated she had nothing to lose, and threw my phone against the wall. I then called the police. She got dressed and left the apartment as soon as she heard who I was talking to.

The police came, took our statements, took pictures and asked if I wanted to press charges. I said no. as a result, we were both arrested for assault. I was conditionally released at my apartment, while she was taken to the station and detained until 5PM the following day. I broke a condition of my release when I tried to reach out to her to apologize and to see If she was ok. I received a call that I might be detained for violating my conditions. Nothing has come of it yet.

I have never been in trouble with the law before. I have been told that this could be done in a month, or it could take as much as a year to resolve. I’ve been quoted widely different rates from a variety of lawyers. I’m lost. All I can think about is how she had to sit in a holding cell during a pandemic, or how she works in childcare and that I’ve ruined her career by doing this. I can’t shake the feeling that I did the wrong thing, that if I had just waited and left the next day without getting the police involved, things wouldn’t be this bad. I’m bigger than her and the bruises, scratches and bite marks she left are almost entirely gone. She bruises easily and has made it clear that she is willing to lie to get at me.

fzxwmi,Trauma from Son,"I am a 37 Y/O mother of 4....one being a step son whom became mine after another marriage, long story short my stepsons father passed away due to and automobile accident a few years ago. 

My 3 children are ABSOLUTE angels, I live a fairly productive life not like I use to although,

My stepson i practically raised since he was 5 I love to death LITERALLY....

Although he ended up on the Adhd spectrum and started taking adderall for it in grade school...

he ended up like the devil himself in human form at certain times,  reason being I am bringing this up is because when he has gone rampage and manic...for no logical reason when the meds should be working...anyway he has shoved me into a wall...apologizing after DOING it.
being HE was misdiagnosed for insomnia.
This type of abuse has went on more than a few occasions maybe more.... not hardcore abuse just hitting and push/shove.... before my sons walk over to break it up


Moral of it, I went to my doctor for a blood pressure complaint, when this was a thing of the present that I have been experiencing which was HELL...I did not bring up the abuse I was put through, That could have caused MY BP issue. 

I preyed this would not effect me in terms of domestic abuse problems. The act that I was put through while trying to calm him down out of love for him.


He is doing alot better In the present day.


My main concern as to why I am posting here is. 
Would this type of thing from a CHILD cause trauma or chronic trauma to ME as a parent to where I may need other medication other than BP meds for their increase in STROKES.


I am currently prescribed a BP med and xanax for anxiety. It works well for my issues but is this the right idea long term? If I want to live a long health issue free life. My son is very concerned about any trauma HE may have put me through.

He believes the MEDS I have been using may be beneficial to me to discontinue and switch to some other medications that would be better tolerated for my health and these kind of aging issues from unstable children.

My son has become fearful for my health saying that I may not need those specific meds, that others would promote healthy living.


Thank you to anyone and everyone who took the time to read this...

Am I wrong to think he shouldn’t have said any of that, especially in front of the neighbors? It was an honest mistake and I was already nervous about messing up.",wondrblundr,2020-04-12 11:29:27,7,142,23.67,44.41,64.56,1.98,15.78,16.9,93.66,64.08,19.72,12.68,7.04,2.11,0,3.52,0,7.04,7.04,13.38,12.68,10.56,4.93,3.52,20.42,6.34,1.41,0.7,0.7,0.7,5.63,1.41,4.23,0.7,0.7,0.7,10.56,0.7,1.41,0,4.23,10.56,1.41,0.7,2.11,2.82,0.7,2.82,2.82,0,2.11,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,9.86,4.23,1.41,2.82,0,1.41,8.45,10.56,0.7,17.61,2.11,9.86,5.63,0,0,3.52,0.7,0,0,0.7,0.7,0,0,0,0,23.94,4.93,4.23,0,0,1.41,0,2.82,5.63,4.93,0,0
g04ols,I feel forgotten,I don't even know why I try reach out for help. Even the domestic abuse shelters I feel like are just telling me there isn't anything they can do. I don't have kids so because of this over and over and over again I am turned away for help that I ask for. I'm not even gonna ask anymore. I should know by now that my life isn't that valuable because I don't have kids. Yeah ok maybe people don't think that but then start helping people like me instead of turning me away constantly. I'm over it. I understand that childrens lives need to be put first obviously but if you keep turning away nonparents then what happens when they do get pregnant by an abusive asshole. Then you will help them ? Help them before that happens.

g08z9n,"Not sure if this belongs here... Abusive marriage from both sides, what should I do?","So I tried posting this in r/relationships but the mods took it down and recommended I post here.. Not sure if this belongs here because I think the abuse is two sided in this case but.. I guess it's worth a shot.. 

We've been married for 2 years now, we’re both 22. We got married quickly, and (stupidly) without really knowing each other's bad sides, due to the military. (he is no longer in the military now) I guess the reason I'm here is to ask is there anyway this marriage can be saved? Do you think a toxic and abusive marriage can turn into a healthy one? Neither of us want to be divorced, I never imagined myself having to go through that especially at a young age. It's hard for me to imagine having to start over from square one with all this extra baggage I'll have.. Anyways I guess I'll give an example of how bad it is (from both sides) by telling you what happened during out last big fight. (I think this fight in particular he acted worse, although I started it but I assure you I can be just as bad as well - just in different ways)

So a few days ago we started arguing, things were getting heated I felt very furious, hurt, and disrespected, and kinda frankly lost it. So during the argument I threw the blue joycon (half the nintendo switch controller) and aimed at his head. But I missed and hit the wall instead. That made him furious, so he bashed the table I was sitting at towards me. Then he threw the nintendo switch at the wall full force (luckily only pieces of it broke off) Then he left the room. At this point I was pissed because I thought he broke the switch, but I wasn't really yelling anymore I was more like (wtf dude!) and he was still extremely angry. We argued some more, him being way more angry compared to myself, the switch wasn't broken... I would of probably lost it if it was. But I was still extremely mad, and felt like our marriage was garbage so I threw our wedding ring into a full trash bag. Then he freaked out and bent me over and started pushing my head towards the rotten trash telling me to dig it out, I refused, then he let go of me and dumped all the trash onto the floor. We fought some more but that was basically it.

So that's what happened, and fights to a similar caliber (and even worse) happen maybe once a month? Sometimes more frequent. He's broken door frames, smashed in doors, (mainly trying to get into a room if I locked it), he's smashed a tv, etc. But he's never really hitten me, the worse he's done was push my head down to the ground so I couldn’t escape his grip or try to force my wedding ring off my finger. I've hitten him, and scratched his face. (a lot of what I do is mostly unintentional I just kind of lose it) I've ripped chunks of my own hair out during fights, and have become literally hysterical, and incoherent due to a fight. We have both threaten suicide, me more often than him. But he does worse gestures than me. Literally dry firing a gun to his head for hours with hopes he'll load it on accident due to muscle memory. Anyways.. It's bad. We both probably have really bad mental health issues... We need a lot of work. It's really bad. Is there any chance to save it... Should I even want to? He seems to want this marriage more than I do.. I mean I do too.. But I want a healthy relationship... not this... But I don't want to get divorced either... What should I do? There are some details to are relationship that are probably really important that I don't really feel comfortable mentioning... but yeah that's the jist of it.",Klutzy_Emphasis,2020-04-12 18:22:19,3,688,26.37,35.8,72.37,1,14.33,14.53,92.59,58.28,19.77,13.66,8.14,1.74,0.44,3.34,0,6.1,5.38,11.34,10.03,7.41,7.41,1.89,18.6,6.4,3.63,0.87,1.02,3.63,7.7,1.74,5.96,0.15,3.05,1.02,10.17,1.6,0.15,0,3.49,15.41,2.18,1.16,2.33,4.36,1.6,5.52,2.18,0.29,0.44,1.31,1.45,1.16,0.44,0,0,9.16,3.78,1.02,2.03,0.73,1.89,5.38,11.48,1.02,14.39,1.74,7.7,4.94,0.29,0.44,0.58,0.15,0,0.15,1.6,0.44,0.44,0.15,0.15,0.44,20.93,9.3,3.92,0,0,0.87,0.15,0.15,0,3.49,2.91,0.15

g0hdup,I'm confused,"I (NB, 27) am unsure about whether my partner (NB, 29) is abusive (anymore) or not.

I have to start by saying that I am a forgetful person around the house. This means I forget to dispose off garbage, put things away, or do something in a specific way even when my partner asks me to. I also use social media quite frequently, because I share a lot of thoughts and opinions about topics I care about. Both of these things upset my partner a lot and they say that it seems like I'm ignoring what they say purposely and that is what makes them really angry. They say that my frequent use of social media makes me forgetful and that reducing it will help me remember things better. The fact that I don't reduce my use of social media, that I use it even when they're talking to me or trying to spend time with me, and that I do not check their messages when I'm out with other people is what is causing them to get upset and angry.

A couple days ago, I forgot to throw away a plastic bag that contained a bedsheet cover set and ended up leaving it by the bed. To alert me to the fact that I needed to throw it away, they came and tried to put it on my head. I assumed they were trying to put it around my head and I got scared and upset and I told them this. They clarified that they were trying to put it on my head, which to me doesn't seem any better. Is putting garbage on your partner's head something that is considered okay, even if it's done playfully?

This isn't the first time they're doing it. They've come and put garbage I haven't thrown away on my table. There are times when I (unwittingly) leave stains on dishes that I have cleaned. One time, they brought the unclean dishes and put them on my table.

When my partner is angry with me (specifically in this instance), they sometimes slam doors or bang the cooker on the kitchen counter (I have to point out that they don't do this all the time). I've heard that this constitutes abuse and I genuinely get scared when they do this. A couple of hours ago, they swept everything off a spare table on which I keep my boxes of incense out of anger so that they could start packing a bag to leave (they didn't eventually, because our country is under lockdown). Am I crazy or is this not okay? Am I justified in being scared that they might hurt me?

More importantly, is any of this comparable to me being forgetful? Am I being malicious by being forgetful or doing it out of spite? I'm not even sure if I'm reporting this with all the facts.

I genuinely don't know if I'm right or wrong. I know I could make a better effort to remember things.

(When I said anymore, this is what I meant: They caused an injury on my face while drunk in 2018, which had to be treated with surgery. I hit them back during this incident, they're no longer physically violent, and they've stopped drinking. This happened because I asked them to leave. I haven't since, because I hoped they'd change. I asked them to stay, even though they offered to leave at the time.)",mananabananafanana,2020-04-13 04:43:47,11,578,17.09,25.53,96.42,7.67,18.06,13.49,92.04,61.59,26.47,16.26,11.07,0.17,0.17,0,4.84,10.21,3.98,12.63,10.55,4.5,7.09,2.25,22.15,3.46,1.21,2.6,0.87,1.73,5.36,1.9,3.46,1.38,1.38,0.17,10.21,0,0.87,0,0,13.84,2.6,2.94,1.21,4.84,1.56,3.81,1.21,0,1.04,0.17,2.42,1.04,0.52,0,1.04,5.19,2.08,1.73,0.52,1.04,0.52,5.02,13.15,0.52,15.57,3.46,6.57,5.88,0.35,0.69,0.69,0.17,0,0,0.35,0,0,0.35,0,0,16.09,4.5,3.81,0.17,0,0.87,0,0,0,3.98,2.77,0

g0mhsd,Rebuilding my life,"I left my abuser three months ago and while I am now free I have almost lost everything.

g0nyr2,I just need to talk this out,"So I need to type this out. It just happened today. I am having trouble coming to terms with it and I feel terrible but need to have a sounding board.  
I am a lesbian in a 2.5 year relationship with a girl who is bipolar type 2 with panic disorder and adhd.
She is on medication and sees a doctor.  
I work during this pandemic she does not.  
We recently moved in together only after basically living together for the past year.  
She has had 1 other really bad episode before where she got manic depressive and threatening. Wanted to break up with me. Called me names and insulted me.  
Her doctors adjusted her medication and eventually months later she was ok.  
This time around, it started around two days ago, she started to get verbally abusive. She would tell me Im pathetic and she wanted to break up with me. We were no longer couple. She would shout and scream at me for no apparent reason.  
However today something new happened.  
At 3 am she comes in from the spare bedroom where she had been sleeping and cuddles up with me.  
I get up at 6 am and I tell her I love her. She says I love you back so I am thinking we are getting back to normal again.  
At 8 am she starts getting fidgety saying she doesnt know what to do.  
At 8:30 she gets up and says if I ever tell her I love her again she is going to cut herself and goes to the kitchen to get kitchen knives. I hear the kitchen knives on the counter.
I have a history of domestic abuse by the way.
So I go in to try to get her to stop cutting, she has the knife perpendicular to her wrist.
She grabs the other knife off of the counter and comes at me. Chases me out of the house with both knives. I grab my house keys in case she locks me out.
She manages to wrestle my phone out of my hand while I grab my keys. I had taken photos of her and the knives. 
She takes my phone and locks herself in the spare room, deletes the photos.
I have a co-worker on chat call the cops for me because she was chasing me in my front yard with knives.
She drove to her moms an hour south of here.
The cops filed an incident report of a domestic disturbance.
She is saying that the relationship is over.
She came back after the cops left.

g0posc,Abusive mother won't leave. Need an advice.,"Hello,

I'm not sure how to proceed with this situation so I decided I should ask for an advice, maybe someone would see the things differently.

So a little background first. Short version my mother's mental health is a piece of shit and she thinks is just fine.

Long version - I guess mental issues are transmitted over the genes since I am not so well too and also seem to remember clearly most of my life, but the most bright memories I have are from the traumas I had, especially the ones my parents did to me. As a kid, I was constantly punished for everything, grew to be very closed-in-myself teenager who wanted to kill himself (still thinking about doing it). When I was little, I really liked to ride a bike, still had supporting wheels, and one day I apparently rode it so much that my mother locked it away and I never saw it. Guess what, now I am over 20y/o and can't ride neither bike or roller skates or anything. Probably if it wasn't for my asthma maybe I would had to teach by myself how to swim. Next, one day I went to play with the kids next door and we played hide and seek. I hid so well, no one found me for 2-3 hours. I was hiding with one other kid too. When our mothers found us, the other kids mother cried of worry. Mine beat the shit out of me. This is the day I recall as ""my mother doesn't love me"". Then my father left, because he so much couldn't stand my mother that almost killed her. But also being drunk. Up next living with mentally unstable parent who had to take care of two kids weren't easy. For the kids. 11 years ago, my grandfather died which was so devastating, as he was the person who took care of me whenever my mother was god knows where, so devastating, that it made me stop believing in church/god/religion and all that bs. Took me a while to process. Then for some reason, after the next Christmas we stopped gathering with the other half of the family - her sister/my aunt - years later to found out if was a matter of money from the will. My mother apparently was ripped of which she kept to herself unlit 2 years ago when things went south.

But there is this thing about my mother - she is the greediest person in the world. There was always chocolate in the house, but the food she was buying while we were growing was the cheapest shit in the store. One of the many reasons I grew up  with weak immune system. The amount of unknown meat and instant rammen we consumed is unmeasurable. But let's get back to the part with my grandparent's will.

She got enough money to invest and buy an apartment. This same apartment is still empty 11 years later. Nothing was done inside. I've only been there once, my brother never even seen it. 11 years - nothing. Waste of money. While now I have to spend half of the amount spend on that apartment to fix my health and teeth, because there was no money, again, 11 years ago, to get me braces. Now whenever someones ask me to smile, I have to leave, because I am sick of crying in front of other people for what a shitty life my mother build for me.

Let's continue with the trauma. A year after my the death of my grandfather, can't remember what could have been the reason, maybe a bad grade or didn't do the dishes, but I've got my mother screaming at me and throwing a suitcase at me to pack my thing because I am going for adoption. Of course that didn't happen because of my brother's crying like someone is being killed. This scene repeated itself 3 more times. Every time was devastating. 

Later on I grew up so she couldn't beat me any more, but the constant screaming continued. Whenever I asked about the apartment, there was a scene. Whenever I wanted more money for school so I could actually get something to eat, there was a scene. From 1st to 10th grade my daily allowance was 1$. No matter that the prices weren't the same any more, that was it. 20$ a month. School days only. At least I learned how to manage my budget so I could eat 3 times a week while being at school. But whenever it was a matter of money, there was a scene. There was the constant threat that I am going to sleep under the bridge if I don't behave, which as a teenager was really hard.

My mother, the scrooge, never supported me in anything. I had passion for arts - music and drawing. But she never believed in me. I had to save money from birthdays for 4 years to by myself my first guitar. Took so long, that at the time I got it, I didn't have time to play. Never supported my drawing too. So I left that too. And I was forced to stick with what brings money and so I am working since 10th grade so I can be independent. But that wasn't enough. 

She always undermined my knowledge, because you see, she is 63y/o now with masters degree who is working at 2+ places to make a minimum wage and half, while I don't even have a bachelor degree and am getting 5 times what she makes and know 2 languages besides my initial one and constantly read books and articles to keep my knowledge up to date.

But here is another problem with her, beside probably being bipolar. She stockpiles things, useless things. Boxes full of baby clothes, drawings of me and my brother from the kindergarten, 30+ y/o documents which are unreadable, jars, brochures, tons of plastic packages from food that was eaten months ago, old medicine which expired years ago, old electronic that doesn't work, EVERYTHING. She is like the character Plyushkin from Gogol's novel. Just piles junk. For years I used to clean the house whenever she's gone for more than two days. But it is like the Jedi - it returns. She is just strong with the trash. And the house is more like a junk yard. Because of all the trash there is no place to store my things or even worse - our clothes.

Few days ago, after she threw a two weeks long rant because her boss is canceling all the work cell phones the firm issued, continuously screaming for no reason and blaming us because she can't find her of phone in the mess I stood up and kicked her out of the room. She then forced her way in the room and then I snapped, forced her back into the other room and told her to leave the house immediately or I'll call the cops. Since then she refuses to leave and now even acts as nothing happened. And here is the tricky part - I own the apartment we're living in, not she, because it wasn't hers on papers initially and she never made the effort to fix that and the only thing she owns is that empty trash she bought 11 years ago.

TL;DR starts here to summarize the rant.
My mother is a greedy scrooge, a trash collector, abusive, toxic that ruled over my and my brothers life fro decades because of her old fashioned ideas and not wanting to accept that we're in 21st century, Stalin is dead and things has changed a lot since the post-war times. I got sick of her acting as the king of the world, constantly throwing threats, not giving a shit about other people's opinion, no sense of personal space and boundaries. I after so many years of patience and enduring shit from her, I stood up and told her to leave willingly or else I'll be forced to call the police and force her out. Since then, three days ago, she has occupied the kitchen, doesn't want to leave and acts like nothing happened.
I am really patient and can't decide what to do next since I suspect that being such a monster she doesn't have where to go, but this is the one person in the whole damn world that I hate the most and can't stand anymore to live in my home.

g0vagf,A little help from some friends...,"Hello and thank you for reading.  This is a long story, but I will keep it as short as I can.

Last May, my Grandmother passed away.  My Uncle inherited her home and all the belongings in it.  He asked me and my wife to move in with him.  I was hesitant, as I have pets (dog and cat) and told him as much.  He agreed to let them come as well, so me and wifey packed up and moved in.  I even paid more then we agreed in the beginning.

The last month has been compete HELL.  He's not well, he's an alcoholic, and he is verbally abusive to my wife while I am not around.  I won't get into specifics, but she does not feel safe when I am not here.  I work a seasonal job, and it's about to start (first day was today, had to come home early to, I guess protect her)

Long story short, the cops were called, and he was informed he couldn't just kick us out, cause he wanted us to leave immediately.  I tried to tell him it wasn't legal to do that, but, like I said, he has mental issues.  We agreed May 15th we are out (hopefully sooner) but my question is this:  Is it LEGAL for him to deny us bathroom/kitchen access?  Does he have the right to just say ANYTHING he wants to us as long as we are here?  Because he is down right abusive verbally.  Can he force us to stay in this tiny ass room? And If were to  get a restraining order...how would that work if he owns the place?  Can I get a restraining order for PAST issues  or do I have to wait for him to do something else?  

My wife is a saint.  She's not ""hard"" at all.  I have no idea why she's with my vulgar, basic ass, but she is.  How can I protect her from him while I'm in the middle of a hay field for 13-14-15 hours a day?

g15avn,"My boyfriend is verbally and physically abusive, I plan to save up to leave him. What do I do in the meantime?","In the first week of our relationship, we did acid (mistake) and he punched me and beat me up until I had a black eye. If our friend wasn’t there to hold him down I think I would’ve been hospitalised/my life would’ve been in danger.  

He pinned it down to the drugs and I believed it wasn’t him or his fault. But since then I’ve seen those same eyes screaming at me. It happens at minimum twice a month. Flailing and a red face screaming every insult under the sun at me. Kicking things and scaring me to death. 

He’s been to psychiatrists - he’s mentally sane. He goes to counselling, but it continues. He understands he has an anger problem, but only tries to fix it because of me, and doesn’t believe he is abusive. It recently escalated to physical violence in efforts to control me. Twisting my arm, pushing me to the ground, yanking my arms until it leaves bruises. Telling me it was: an accident/you fell because you’re dramatic/you’re exaggerating/I didn’t mean to hurt you. Afterwards being apologetic and offering to buy me things like food. 

After reading Why Does He Do That (thanks to this sub!) I can see now that he is not out of control in these situations. It’s a choice, and if he truly wanted to stop it it would’ve never happened in the first place. 

Once I read the book I came to him simply asking to talk later in the day about the physical abuse two weeks ago. He got livid at me, starting insulting and screaming at me. It was then I truly saw clarity. Even though I was crying and breaking down, I could see clear as day that he is simply an abusive and manipulative person. No matter how much he says sorry or seems apologetic - it will happen again. There is a part of him that gets a thrill out of the power. 

I’m a student so I’m tight on money and obviously in lockdown. I plan to stay living with him until lockdown is over, so I can start working again and eventually move out by myself (and take our kitten with me). If he shouts at me again, I’m immediately calling the police and telling them everything he’s done to me. I’ve also messaged a domestic abuse helpline. I’m not tolerating it anymore, and I can’t believe I have for so long. It just slipped into my life. 

I don’t believe I’m in danger, but I can see clear now what is going on. It’s not because of a mental disorder, anger management problems, it’s not because he has trauma from his childhood, its not because he was drunk, on drugs, or blacked out, or that I provoked or triggered him, it’s because he is an abuser. 

The thing is, what do I even do from now to then? It’s going to take months, do I continue suggesting that we need to have a talk? How am I supposed to emotionally disconnect from him when he’s around all the time and the person I love in his calm periods? Even though I can see clearly, I still have this need to put him in his place, and get him to realise his abusiveness. I can tell there’s still a part of me while writing this that has hope that he could one day change and get better. (Though either way I want to get out of this situation). I also don’t want to live with friends or family, I don’t want to leave my cat behind. So what do I do now? 

Do I continue to try and show him who he truly is, but still plan on leaving and moving out, or do I completely emotionally disconnect myself from him?",expensivetastex,2020-04-14 06:13:57,22,661,15.09,36.39,62.09,3.16,15.74,16.04,94.7,64.9,23.75,17.1,9.68,0.76,0.61,5.9,0.15,6.66,4.39,13.77,11.5,6.51,9.53,2.27,21.03,2.72,1.21,1.36,0.91,0.91,5.45,1.51,3.93,0.15,1.66,0.45,11.35,0.15,0.45,0,6.05,12.41,1.36,2.42,2.72,2.12,1.82,4.24,3.18,1.97,0.76,0.3,2.72,0.76,1.51,0,0.3,7.87,1.82,1.66,2.57,1.21,0.91,4.08,15.73,1.66,16.19,2.42,6.51,7.41,1.36,0.61,0.3,0.3,0,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.4,5.3,4.24,0.15,0,0.91,0.15,0.3,0,4.54,1.21,0.61

g16gs3,Victim Impact Statement - advice??,"Good morning. I joined this group this morning in hopes for some advice. I've included some back story, but the advice I'm seeking begins further down. 

Long story not so short, I was in a relationship with a narcissist for  3 1/2 years. I knew it was a bad relationship, but I was in a bad place. About the time I decided I deserved better, I ended up pregnant and decided to stick it out (bad move, I know) and see if he would change. Obviously he did not.

The relationship was terrible. He was mentally, physically and sexually abusive towards me and was addicted to methamphetamine and smoked marijuana literally all day long. I was working full time and he did not work. He lived off of $400/m of SSI. My parents had to watch our son while I was at work because he wouldn't. I could never leave my son with him for more than an hour before he would start blowing up my phone if I didn't come home. He never spent any of his money on diapers, clothes, food, or any kind of care for our son. He would hit me, spit in my face, yell at me and threaten me. He would force sex on me. He would threaten to have men come into our house and rape me if I didn’t comply. He would tell me if I didn't give him money to pay for his drugs then the dealers would find us and hurt my son. He told me if I tried to leave he had taken pictures of me asleep with a meth pipe and would have my son taken away from me. I lost many friends and was isolated from my family because of him.

When my son was 2 1/2 he got angry when I told him no and spit in my face, as he had witnessed his father do to me many times.That's when I finally made the choice to leave. I moved back in with my parents. He still did not give up. He was stalking me, threatening me, telling me he would kill me or send his drug buddies to my parents' house to kill all of us. There was another situation which ended with him being arrested.

Fast forward to 2018, I moved from Colorado to Nebraska. He was released from jail and was given supervised visits with our son, for which I would drive my son to Colorado. Shortly after, he ended up getting into some kind of trouble at the halfway house he was in, they don't provide me any of the details, and was moved to a minimum security prison in Colorado. A few months ago I received a letter notifying me he was moved to a different medium-security prison. A couple of days ago I received another letter informing me of his parole hearing coming up in June.

The letter informed me that I have the right to submit a victim impact statement. I've never been through this before and I'm not sure what a victim impact statement is or what should be said. I've tried researching it on the internet, but each article seems so different from the last. Has anybody else ever submitted one and, if so, what kind of advice can you give me?

I just wish it were possible to never have to have any kind of contact with him again, including him being part of my son's life. The last 3 years my son has had a different man in his life who has taken on more responsibility than his biological father ever even tried to. This man has even suggested wanting to look into being able to adopt him, but even that I'm not sure of the possibility to make it happen with the way things are with his biological father.",lalaland302,2020-04-14 07:26:24,10,650,39.24,51.23,55.6,5.8,17.11,14.92,93.54,58,20.62,17.23,10,0.92,0.15,6,0.15,3.38,4.31,14.15,10.31,3.69,6.15,2.46,19.54,2.92,2,1.38,1.54,3.08,4.31,1.23,3.08,0.46,1.38,0.46,16,2.77,0.46,0,8.46,13.54,1.85,1.08,3.38,3.85,1.69,4.31,1.85,1.08,0.62,0.15,3.23,0.92,1.23,0.62,0.31,8.77,2.62,1.38,2.92,1.08,1.38,9.08,7.54,0.46,15.08,2.92,6.46,6.77,1.38,0.31,0.77,0.62,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.23,5.69,3.69,0,0,0.46,0,0.31,0,2.15,0.31,0.62

g19c6g,What are the steps I can take to leave my boyfriend?,"Hello, I have been with my (20f) boyfriend (25m) for a year and a half now and I have finally chosen to open my eyes to see he isn't the one for me. I moved in with him to escape the physical abuse, sexual assault, and neglect that I was experiencing at home.

I tried to take a break for my mental health (I told him that) for the first time a few days ago because I was just tired of us fighting over the smallest of things and it was affecting my mental health. He automatically went on a rant about how 'I won't be dating other people while I'm living with him' and he gave me a month to leave knowing that wasn't an option due to the fact I have no money and Coronavirus is happening (everytime I tried to get a job, because I had time while in college at the time, he'd get mad and tell me that I needed to focus on school ONLY like I was his child).

We made up after but I feel the same. I feel like he would just threw me out on the streets if he felt I deserved it.

I no longer feel anything because I now remember a lot of things that I didn't notice early in the relationship such as he made insensitive comments on my depression and anxiety coping methods, he'd throw away my important school things such as notes when angry on a video game so he can piss me off too, and importantly, he would repeatedly ask why I wasn't over my still recent sexual assault from my mom's boyfriend.

I understand his perspective but it isn't that easy and he thinks that my depression would instantly just go away if I didn't do certain things such as think about my assault (which is impossible if I'm just back in the same environment) and cut off the only person I have in my family. I didn't grow up with a father so I do not have anyone else unlike him.

I have taken a few steps such as saving up my 'allowance' but I'm struggling to act as if I want to stay any longer. I never thought I'd be in this situation.

To be short. I am diagnosed with Shizotipical + OCD 

&amp;#x200B;

Since 2010 to 2018 I was in relationship (she was my first and only sexual partner and lover in traditional sense)

We used to leave all this period apart ( I leaved with my parents, she leaved with hers)

However she over-controlled me and controlled my social contacts. It began with simple ""stop talking with that female colleague of yours"" and in last year of relations became something extremly sinister and constant.  I felt trapped in this relations and really thought of suicide.  I felt that she can force me to do whatever she wanted and I couldn\`t say No. 

However somehow I managed to cancel this relationship. 

However, 2 years later I am still plagued by it. I feel that on the one hand I still love her dearly despite all the pain, on the other hand I am afraid that she will return in my life and take control of it again.

Somehow I am quiet vulnareable to guilt and she can use it (tears and other stuff).

Speaking about guilt-vulnerability, I am also can\`t permit myself to start new relationship or just have simpe casual sex (though it would be difficult with OCD anyway).   
Fore some unfathonable reason I feel that my body (sexually) is her property. That I must remain loyal to her (despite the fact of breakup). I don\`t even let myself to hug a female friend since I see something sexual even in casual hugs. 

I used Tinder, but always kept distance in order to avoid even light touch and always made clear that we are not on date, we are drinking socially.

I even dont\`t let (or try to not let to) my mother to touch me since I feel sexually harassed. I realize that most touches are social, however I can do nothing with that feeling. 

What else is important?  
I leave in Russia and teach economics&amp;political science 

I take antyspsychotic medication and visit therapist 

I am video games nerd and fantasy lover 

I am 32   


My doctor believes that my obsession with ex is a based on my disorder and that only eforced medical treatment in hospital can probably resolve this problem.

My family have abused me so many times physically and mentally, my brain began to normalize it so much so i can cope and function properly. I'm so dependent on them, financially and mentally even though they treat me like a subhuman. They abuse me then they treat me with a little sweet talk then they abuse me again. I know I can just call for help but I fear the system will fail me or nothing life changing will really happen. Also due to cultural beliefs.

I'd like to have a burner phone on hand that I can give the friend next time they reach out for help; I'm hoping that would let them call for help should their partner isolate them like that again. However, all the burner phones I readily find are month-by-month contracts. Are there phones where I could pre-buy a certain amount of call time and texts and have it be valid whenever? I don't know the next time they'll reach out, so I don't just want to keep a phone active for no reason.

g1k6ad,Advice on restraining order,"I have a restraining order against an ex that expires next month. I live in a small town but he doesn’t know where I live. 

It has been 2.5 years. He was a mess but he had never been violent.  I broke up with him, he went to the bar, he drove home from the bar and hit two cars, came back, tried to climb on top of me, wouldn’t let me up, I kicked him and called the cops. Extremely intoxicated. He ran into his car and got arrested for a whole bunch of stuff. 

He has not tried to contact me or see me. He’s totally followed the rules of the order and he’s on probation.  If I extend the order he will get served and we will
have to go to court. I’ve been told by everyone around me that I should let it go. 

I’m happily with someone new now who treats me well. This is causing me major anxiety because I just keep thinking of what if situations. He wasn’t a violent person so I really want to trust that I can let him go.

g1lrye,Situation escalated,"Hi all

I(F21) have been with my bf (30yrs) for 2 years off and on.  He used to slut shame me and gas light me about my past. He did this for a year. One day he went down the mental spiral of verbal vomit and was being extremely mean so I dumped a smoothie on his head and he shut up. Things progressed more and more. I started hitting him and wrestling when he wouldn't listen to me. Or having to scream to get him to stop. Neither of us have any physical abuse in our pasts. He is a lot bigger, over a foot taller and s an amateur fighter, I obviously can not 'win' anything physical. Its definitely progressed in last 2 months as we both dislike our living situation and everything that comes with the quarantine. So I committed to stop being physical because I have some amount of self control when I am angry, and its not me, and absolutely not okay with me but instead I scream. Loud. And he hates it. Always threatening to leave and shit. Well these past several times we have been arguing (about the stupidest shit) and it always escalates and he has started to choke me out. Which is obviously not okay. It is hard because these situations are so complex. There are other things going on as well but seems like too much to try and explain. There is a lot of good in our relationship as well. We are best friends, want very similar things now and later in life, both fill in where the other one cant, we are genuinely happy together and understand one another. This is mostly a vent. What would you do in this situation? I am pretty secluded where I live, very far away from family and dont have many friends here. It feels like I would lose my way if we break up and I also realize I am losing my way staying together.

g1qkrh,Want to vent but also need advice,"My dad has been abusive and aggressive towards my mom since I can remember, and right before we had to start staying in place I finally had convinced my mom to get a divorce.

I finally let my older siblings know whats been going on. They are all 15+ years older than me so they never got to see how violent things got. Theyve begun to help pay the bills my dad no longer wants to pay for us. And helping us with legal resources. I hate the timing of all this but more than ever I want to push on and finally see progress to help my mom live a better life. 

She is very strong and I know she never felt she needed police to be involved because she isnt afraid of him. Even after he locks her out or breaks her things. But she does fall victim to saying that the next time he hits her shes leaving :(. obvs hasnt been the case. 

For me i get very nervous around my dad. And I become emotionally distressed staying home whenever both my parents are home. Before, my boyfriend would come for me whenever I couldnt handle being there. Right now is a little harder to stay away from home but I still go with him when I get into panics. 

Since coming out about this to one of my friends, shes offered me her spare room to stay in for as long as I want. Even move in my computer so I can still work/do my online studies.  I want to so badly but I feel so much guilt that id be ""abandoning"" my mom. Even though I absolutely would still be helping her with legal things and coming over when she needs help. I feel scared leaving her alone with my dad and what could happen without me in between them. He doesnt go out of his way to hurt her. They dont even talk and he tries to never be in the same room as her. But he gets mad or annoyed at anything she does and that's when things escalate to 100. I'll be turning 23 the 18th and my whole life has been torn from wanting to get away but not wanting my mom to be alone. I dont even want to be here when it is my birthday.

My mom had only started working at a hair salon right before covid shut everything down. She has no money of her own, my siblings barely get by themselves. Because we're low income the legal aid of Los Angeles for domestic abuse can help us but things are only over the phone for now. Im still thinking whether or not to move out my things bit by bit. I dont care if its unsafe to be out in only scared for my mom. After we have a phone meeting with a lawyer and also a social worker I'm going to think of my choices from there. I know my mom doesnt want to stay here either. Shes told me she also feels uncomfortable here. But she hates how this has destroyed me emotionally and if I want to leave I can. But she's the one being abused and I feel I'm not the one who should get to leave whenever I want to. I want much better for my mom, but maybe the only option right now is to see what the lawyer and social worker can help us with...

Tldr right before stay at home came in place I started the process of my my mom divorcing my abusive father. We've gotten in touch with the city's legal aid for domestic abuse, but the amount of help may be limited or will take longer because of the current state of things. My friend has offered me her spare room to live in since being home with both my parents is destroying me emotionally.

g1t5xi,How can I get help without letting my abusive mother know?,"\*TA account

\*Redirected from r/relationships to this sub

My mother (50f) has been and still is both verbally and physically abusive to me (18f) and my sister (15f). I take most of the heat as my sister and dad (50m) aim to please her as to not anger her (are they enablers?). I have a suspicion that she has narcissistic personality disorder but I'm not a professional so I can't diagnose her.

Backstory:

Ever since the lockdown began she has become increasingly easily agitated, will find any excuse to be angry at someone and is incredibly paranoid that we are sick.

Today she got angry at me and slapped me multiple times on my back, then proceeded to hit my arms (I just got a flu vaccine today and she aimed there). When I was defending myself (i.e grabbing her arms to prevent her from hitting me and blocking her hits) one of my blocks ended up touching her face - and by touching I mean barely grazing, but she started yelling and crying that I slapped her. My dad came outside and started yelling at me to let go of her and grabbing my arms, but she was the one holding onto me. Then she took an IKEA shoehorn (the long ones) and tried to hit me with it. After I blocked a couple of hits, she took my dad's chef knife (about 10inches long) and threatened to cut my arms if I didn't let go of the shoehorn. Then she threw the knife and told me to leave.

I locked myself in my room (but she has keys to every room in the house) while she proceeded to cry and make herself the victim (saying why does everyone do this to her, she did nothing wrong etc.) and threatened to divorce my dad too. She took my phone and snapped the SIM card so now I don't even have a way of contacting emergency services or my friends.

A couple of my friends have offered to pick me up and give me a place to stay if needed, but if I leave it will both make it worse, and I'd likely not be able to return, and as I'm still financially dependent on them, leaving is not an option.

So what can I do? I can't call the police, can't leave and I can't explain to her and make her understand because anything I do might make it worse. I also can't access counseling through my university, and I can't call a helpline because she took my phone and snapped my sim. I personally think there's nothing I can do except put up with it until I have enough money to leave, but that's hard at the moment since I'm out of work due to COVID-19 (I was a runner in a cafe)

TL;DR - my mother is becoming more physically abusive. What solution is there to make me feel safe?",TA2453,2020-04-15 07:39:26,11,506,24.89,20.88,75.29,1,25.3,15.81,89.72,59.68,21.15,17.98,12.06,0.2,0,5.34,0.4,3.16,4.55,12.06,8.89,3.95,10.08,2.96,18.18,2.96,1.58,0.99,0.59,1.78,4.94,0.59,4.35,0.79,2.17,0.4,11.26,1.98,0.4,6.32,0.79,12.25,2.37,2.77,0.79,2.37,0.99,4.55,2.17,0,0.99,1.19,2.77,1.38,1.19,0,0.2,7.11,1.38,0.99,1.98,1.78,1.58,4.15,13.24,1.19,12.25,2.57,4.94,5.14,1.38,0.4,0.59,0.59,0,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,0,16.6,3.56,2.57,0.2,0.2,0.79,0,0.59,0,2.96,4.74,0.99

g2eivn,"If I told anyone he hit me, they wouldn’t believe me.","He’s been gaslighting me for years and admits he hit me but won’t admit how bad it was and even says it was my fault he hit me most of the time. I feel absolutely crazy. 

Most mutual friends didn’t even know we were in a relationship bc we wanted to hide it. So if I told them he was physically abusive to me for an entire year, they’d likely laugh it off and take his side saying I’m just some crazy female. P much all his friends are misogynists who talk shit about women and think they’re all crazy if they complain or speak up about anything. 

I always put on an act around them pretending nothing was wrong when we all hung out.. and since it happened a couple years ago and I never “complained” or said anything then, they’d probably just think I was lying altogether and just batshit insane. 

I wish I got police reports the dozens of times he hit me but I wanted to die then and was “ok” with it. Theyd prob think I was delusional simply because I stayed with him so long.  

I’m still with the abuser but it’s very on and off. No one knows how bad it got. I did tell his mom about it a couple times (were both 20) but she basically told me she didn’t want to hear about it. He doesn’t physically abuse me anymore but threatens to, and mentally abuses and gaslights me about the situation, including ignoring me when I try to mention it or talk about anything that makes me upset.",deepdami,2020-04-16 06:05:05,5,280,5.61,52.86,50.48,1,20,12.14,95.71,61.07,24.64,18.21,10,1.07,0,4.64,2.5,6.43,3.21,10.36,8.93,8.93,11.43,2.86,22.14,3.21,0.71,1.79,1.07,3.93,7.14,0.71,6.43,0.71,2.5,0,17.5,0.36,0.71,1.79,3.93,18.93,3.57,2.14,2.86,5.71,3.21,4.64,2.5,0,2.14,0.36,1.07,0.36,0.71,0,0,6.43,2.14,0.36,1.07,1.07,2.14,8.57,9.64,1.43,10.36,0.71,4.29,5.71,0.71,0,0,0,0,0.36,1.79,0.36,0.71,0.71,0,0,13.57,5.36,1.79,0,0,0,0,0,1.43,4.29,0.71,0
g2gsvb,So anxious! vent post,"With expenses and needs piling up, I have NO clue how I am going to get internet for my daughter to do her school work. I used my last money today to get an uber to my sisters so she could do her homework today, but I can't stay here. A family friend blessed me, she is letting my 7 year old daughter and I stay in a beautiful little cottage she owns, with two bedrooms, furnished, and doesn't expect rent until I get stable, which is amazingly kind of her. 

Little background, I left earlier this month after 14 years of an abusive marriage, sexual, physical, financial, and emotional abuse. I made this throw away account the day I left, and have gotten so much support. I am REALLY afraid he is right, I can't take care of us on my own. I am so afraid that I won't have a choice but to go back to him, when Kindness runs out and I still can't pay rent. I just dk. I am constantly looking out my window, afraid he's going to find me, and I won't be strong enough to say no. Or he won't take no for an answer. I am working to get a PFA but courts are closed, unless I called the cops after he hit me, which I didn't. I did see a forensic nurse the last time, because he broke my cheek bone, but declined to have police involved, but I at least have her exam on file.

If you read this far thank you, I know its kind of rambling-ish. I'm scatterbrained and scared shitless still. I am waiting for a call from social services, to see if I can get signed up for benefits even though we are legally married and he makes more than the cut off wage to be eligible. And you have to be separated for six months to be legally sep. where I live. So its one thing after another. I had $200 not last week but the one before, I got as much food as I could with it, a easter basket for my daughter, and spent the last on an uber. Idk what I'll do when food runs outs, maybe beg someone for a ride and go to the drive up food bank. I hate this. I hate him for doing this to me. And I hate me for letting myself depend on him so much for 14 years that I am like an 18 year old instead of a 31 year old woman. The fiancial abuse made it so I HAD to depend on him to live. And I hate myself for letting it happen.

g2sh8v,Am I thinking too much into this?,"So I need to add a little bit of backstory before I ask my question. I am 18 years old (female) and I still live with my parents, I have a chronic illness that is making it hard for me to move out, it keeps me from working most jobs. My parents have been fighting more and more lately, and I try to keep my four younger siblings from being exposed to it, but it's getting harder and harder to stay strong for them. My father is emotionally abusive to my mother, I've done some research and I'm not sure if he is emotionally abusive to myself and my siblings, but I could to too close to the issue to know for sure or not. Anyways, I've had two new interactions with my father that I'm not sure how to handle it. Over the past week when I have gone to give him a hug before I go to bed (he gets pissy if I don't say goodnight to him) and twice when I've gone to give him a hug (he was sitting down at the dinner table and I was standing up) he has grabbed half my butt. The first time I thought it was an accident but after the second time I'm not so sure. Is it possible that it was an accident? Am I crazy and just looking too much into this?

g2t17b,You Have Courage...Believe It,"Courage is often the first thing depleted from a survivor of domestic violence. Not only do our abusers words and actions convince us we are cowardly and weak, but the little courage we have left is used just trying to stay alive. The truth is, survivors of domestic abuse are some the most courageous. Being in an abusive relationship is like waking up in a war everyday, but you are sleeping with the enemy, and to survive you must care for them and put on a brave, selfless and grateful face as you do it, and try hard not to lose yourself in the process. We survivors have courage, we just use it to stay alive instead of being able to use it to leave. 

After the first time my ex-husband hit me, I googled “what do you do if your husband hits you?” We were only engaged at the time but I felt committed to him like he was my husband. Reflecting back now, I realize I did this for a number of reasons:

I wanted to know if one incident of violence made it domestic abuse, or if it could have been a freak incident.

I wanted to know what it would feel like, and how I would be seen, if I came out as a victim of domestic violence. 

I wanted to know how many of us were out there.

I wanted to know how many others had a seemingly “normal and happy” marriage, but their partners just lost their cool sometimes.  

I wanted to know if the next punch was inevitable, or if I could do something to prevent it. 

I wanted to hear that domestic abuse was obvious, and when it happened, you knew without a doubt that it was abuse, and knew you needed to leave. 

I wanted to hear that other marriages had experienced and survived isolated incidents of violence.

I wanted to hear that I didn’t have to leave the love of my life. That we could get through this. 

All I found in that google search, almost 10 years ago, was a yahoo answers page with a discussion forum between other people who had experienced violence in their romantic relationships. I was relieved to see that no one said blatantly that leaving was the only solution. I was also relieved that I couldn’t relate to the other people in the forum's experiences. Everyone described repeated abuse. Violence much more severe than I had experienced. Everyone described being hopeless, with no money, family, education or work experience to fall back on, and use to re-build their lives. I had all of those things. I graduated with honors from a good college, I had a career, I was the primary breadwinner in the relationship, I had loving and supportive family members who loved both of us. Therefore, what I experienced must have not been domestic violence, just something else. Right?

I was relieved, I didn’t have to leave.   

The only thing I explicitly recall reading that stuck with me was that people and marriages can recover from violent moments, if and only if, the abuser takes their actions seriously, and seeks help and treatment for their issues causing violence. That night, I went home, and told him that we could get through this as long as he took his actions seriously, was genuinely remorseful, and made sure it never happened again. He swore, through his tearful eyes, that it would never happen again, and that he loved me. He couldn’t believe what he had done. He was sorry. I believed him. I stayed.  

The next two and half years were a blend of wonderful, happy, and fairy tale kind of love moments intertwined with jaw dropping, nose breaking, life threatening nightmare moments. We planned our wedding, we went to pre-marital counseling. We got married, and moved into a cute little cottage in our favorite part of town. We adopted a dog, and started raising him together. We danced in the living room regularly and cooked dinner together. We laid on the couch on lazy Sunday afternoons. We took mental health days together to talk and work on our relationship. He also came home sometimes and told me he was going to kill me. He hit me during arguments. Grabbed me by the neck and threw me onto our bed when he was ready to sleep before I was. He came after me when I tried to leave and one time pulled me out of bed by my hair when I was trying to sleep after being yelled at and tormented for hours. 

I was in love with and terrified of my husband all at the same time. I was exhausted and worn down by his words. I didn’t know it then but I had started believing the demeaning things he said to me. I was confused, and towards the end, I had zero space away from him to try and sort out what was going on in my head. 

Finally, thankfully, he hit me in front of our friends, in public. The cat was out of the bag. I finally saw what was happening to me through looks in my friends eyes. I left, but that was just the beginning. (I will talk about my recovery at a later time) 

That google search could have helped me leave. It could have helped me see what was happening. It didn’t, not because I was lacking courage to leave or stand up for myself, but because I was in the cycle of abuse and it’s hard to see the red flags through black eyes, and think rationally with a broken and tormented heart. 

I honestly don’t recall if I saw the National Domestic Violence Hotline website. If I did I wouldn’t have selected it because reading it would have told me what I was not ready to hear. That I was in an abusive relationship, and that the night before was just the beginning. That it was only a matter of time before I could relate to the stories of repeated abuse and trauma I read on the Yahoo Answers Forum. Looking back I realize I did that google search to find excuses for my abusive husbands behavior, not for help. I was not ready to leave, and it was because I had been being groomed for that first punch starting years before. 

Admitting you are in an abusive relationship takes a lot of courage. A scarce resource for survivors of abuse. It is not scarce because we have less courage than other people, but because we tap into our courage every moment of everyday to stay alive. 

Once I started to see the abuse for what it was I felt so cowardly and ashamed of my lack of courage that I worked harder to hide the abuse, not harder to leave. I told myself, “ that I had the chance, that first time he hit me, to leave. I could have kept my family, friends, and myself from the pain my abuser caused.” This narrative kept me from leaving, kept me from seeking recovery, and kept me from seeing that I did have courage in the midst of the abuse. I was just using it to keep our marriage alive, and not to keep myself alive. Once I saw a glimpse of the courage I had, I started to see it everywhere. I came to realize that I had had courage all along, I just let my abuser make me believe I didn’t.   

If you are in the thick of abuse and having a hard time admitting it, please please please know that it is normal to be where you are. It is normal to not want to say it out loud. It is normal to not always know what the next right decision is. Please don’t think your fear to leave, and fear to stay is because of weakness, a lack of courage, or because the things your abuser tells you are right. Please don’t think it is proof that you deserve to be where and treated the way you are. Please know, if you are being abused, and still reading this blog post, you have courage. 

As always, if you are in an abusive relationship, I strongly encourage you to call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or text LOVEIS to 22522. Speaking with an advocate is a healthy and safe way to practice admitting you are being abused and receive the support you deserve.",dvsurvivor15,2020-04-16 19:14:09,23,1433,41.95,53.91,65.42,16.75,17.69,17.66,95.18,58.76,20.03,13.54,7.89,1.88,1.67,1.61,0.49,6.49,5.3,13.26,10.05,3.28,7.05,1.95,21.49,4.05,1.67,1.47,1.26,1.19,8.44,3.91,4.54,0.49,2.16,0.42,11.1,0.98,0.28,0,1.95,13.26,3.07,1.74,3,2.65,1.67,3.77,3.42,1.4,0.7,0.84,2.23,0.84,0.91,0,0.14,8.79,4.68,2.02,1.26,0.56,0.63,9.07,8.65,0.28,13.26,2.58,5.58,5.65,0.77,0.42,1.19,0.07,0,0.49,0.21,0.07,0,0.07,0,0,13.26,5.65,5.51,0.07,0,0.14,0,0.42,0.42,0.91,0.14,0
g32tte,My (24F) boyfriend of two years (29M) is abusive. I don't want to let go.,"Basically the title. We've had problems for a long time and deep down I've known. I have amazing friends and I am close with my family. I've been hiding the bad parts of the relationship for months because I don't want people to worry about me, and I want the good to keep going. I'm so in love with him. 

After significant escalation in the past few months, I'm at my breaking point. Crying on another twice-weekly therapy session yesterday, my therapist told me to take the opposite action of what shame makes you want to do, which is hide things from the people you love, and open up. So I did. 

He's accused me of having BPD and I've seen three mental health professionals in the past three months who've proved that wrong. When I suggest that I'm proud of myself for growing, he demands to know if I'm ""going back on"" the things I've said about getting better (I'm not — I've come far and have far to go). He says I make myself seem ""easy"" by seeking validation with other guys, yet doesn't listen when I'm not in the mood for sex or certain sexual things. He says I'm low value. 

If I do something he doesn't like, he bites me or spanks me. I've paid over $800 to stay on trips with him an extra day; $250 to fix his shirts/sunglasses/charger when breaking them was both of our faults. He's literally torn necklaces off my neck while having sex (twice! Hugely sentimental things) and ripped more pairs of my underwear than I can count. He's paid for nothing. I had to beg for him to meet my family and he's very selective about which of my friends he'll meet. I have not met his. I'm putting in 110% effort and have been from the start. I can count on one hand the number of apologies, cute notes, or out-of-his-way things he's done for me. Basically — there's no space for my needs and he's got no interest in listening to them.

There's lots of good though. Our love is fierce. The good moments feel so good. He's brought me a joy I've never had before, he's absolutely brilliant (which is important to me), we push each other in good ways (ran a marathon, went skydiving, have done a whole bunch of scary adventures), travelled a lot, and laugh like little kids *often*. He'll say things or do things when we're together that'll just kill me because of how adorable they are, and how goddamn *lucky* I am to share those moments with him. When we're together this happens more than it doesn't. When we're not together, I see him everywhere. He's still the first person I want to tell about the good and the first person I want comfort from about the bad (though I've given up on that). I have gone my whole life desperate to love and be loved. And I love him deeply. 

I understand about his background and try to be compassionate in the moment too. I just worry things down so much they're almost gone completely — ask for so much reassurance he won't give me any anymore. We've both become hypersensitive, but the truth is my skin is so worn down my feelings are almost like an open wound. He shuts down when he feels anything and in that way, maybe it's the same for him. 

But I don't know how to do it anymore. I'm becoming meek. I want to be the confident, goofy, passionate, sweet, intelligent, loving, understanding person that I've worked so hard to be. I see glimmers of that person in the rest of my life but I'm losing that with him. I know the only way out is to let go, but I can't wrap my head around it. I don't want to fall out of love, I don't want to lose the good. I don't want a future without him in it. 

**TLDR;** my boyfriend is abusive and I'm trying my best but there's no space for me to exist as I am. I love him deeply and there's lots of good. I don't want to lose the love. 

Apparently this is normal. For anyone who's loved and lost, my god I'm sorry. How do I let go? How do I take care of myself again?",whatsurthrowaway,2020-04-17 07:16:41,14,750,17.8,35.93,72.94,86.07,14.42,11.07,94.4,60.8,22.27,17.33,11.47,1.07,0.27,4.13,0.4,4.93,4.4,14.4,13.07,6.93,7.47,2.93,24.13,3.73,1.6,2.27,1.47,2.27,9.2,6.27,2.8,0.67,0.53,0.93,12.8,0.27,0.67,0,4.8,10.93,1.73,1.2,2,2.93,1.2,3.2,2.27,0.4,0.93,0.8,3.6,0.8,0.8,0.53,0.13,11.2,4.53,1.87,2.27,2.27,1.33,4.13,18.13,0.93,14.4,2.53,7.47,4.67,0.53,0.4,0.27,0.27,0.13,0.13,0.4,0.13,0.13,0.13,0,0,23.6,6.53,3.87,0,0.27,0.27,0.13,0.53,0.53,7.87,1.87,1.73

g3e9lt,Court in the time of covid?,"So this is my first time dealing with anything like this and hopefully the last- I got caught up with a guy who I now see was a narcissist and an abuser. He even already had a record for domestic assault (and his ex had a record for attacking him as well) - but because I somehow don’t know how to take red flags seriously, or at least didn’t until now, I still dated him. I was only looking for something fun and casual and he was the one who kept saying that he wanted more (even though he still lived with the ex- it was a mess). Because of the fun and great sex I kept letting it go on and on even though I knew I couldn’t really trust him, and then he started saying things about wanting to move in together and have me meet his kids and how he wanted to marry me even though I’d never met his family- it was absurd. On one of these nights where he was drunk and professing his love to me he got a text from his ex that made it obvious he was still stringing her along as well, and I flipped out and told him to leave, and it ended up in a physical altercation where he pinned me to the ground and choked me. He could have just left or held me down but he used his bicep to actually cut off my airways and even though I was choking and gagging he wouldn’t let me go. When he did let go I called for help and then he would put me back in a chokehold and when I kicked the floor to try to get the attention of my neighbor he taunted me for doing so. It was straight up evil. Once I finally got the door open and away from him I asked my neighbor to call the cops and stood by the door so he couldn’t leave. He kept threatening me by saying they were going to arrest me for starting it, but once they came and questioned us and took pictures of the marks on my neck they arrested him instead. 

The next day I got a call that he was being tried for a felony for second degree assault. At the time I felt shocked and guilty at the fact that I might be “ruining his life.” He has a nine year old daughter and a son. But then because of covid they are not trying any cases and everything has been pushed out to at least July, and today the domestic assault advocate and prosecutor called me to “have a conversation” about the case and see what “my thoughts were.” It all seemed extremely laidback. The first question they asked me was if I was still interested in having a relationship with him, to which I said no, and they really didn’t ask me that much about what actually happened. I definitely got the sense that they wanted me to say that I didn’t care what happened and/or if it got tried as a misdemeanor. So I’ve gone from being guilty to feeling like not enough is being done, because I *did* get choked and he *is* a raging misogynist who has abused women multiple times in addition to being a cheater and liar, and he should get penalized. So I’m not sure what to do or if those of you who went through court cases not in the time of covid think this sounds normal or what advice you would have for me.",Useful-Lion,2020-04-17 17:42:16,3,610,20.23,51.97,40.17,14.46,30.5,12.13,94.1,65.57,21.15,15.41,7.7,0.16,0.33,6.07,1.15,5.74,6.23,12.79,9.18,7.7,11.48,2.13,20.98,2.79,1.31,2.62,1.31,1.15,5.25,2.13,2.95,0.49,1.64,0.16,14.43,0.66,0.49,0.49,6.23,12.13,1.8,1.31,2.46,3.11,1.31,4.59,2.3,0.82,0.98,0.33,1.97,0.33,1.15,0.16,0.16,6.89,1.97,1.15,1.8,1.97,0.33,10.66,6.56,0.98,13.93,2.13,5.9,6.07,0,0.98,1.15,0,0,0,0.82,0,0,0,0.33,0,9.84,3.11,1.8,0,0,0.16,0,0.66,0.98,1.64,0.66,0.82
g3g8hs,My partner of 12 years turned,"Me and my partner have been together for 12 years. We have had our problems in the past and our share of arguments but nothing out of the norm. 
2 days ago I fell asleep on my couch and woke up to him drunk and screaming at me, calling me horrible names and basically going off. I fumbled awake and thought what the hell is going on, I followed him into the kitchen and confronted him and asked what the hell was going on, he went crazy. He was screaming in my face calling me a bitch and a slut ( we’ve been together since we where teenagers I’ve never even been with another man and he knows this ) he started screaming he was unhappy and I’m a horrible cow and he hates me. When he got in my face I put my arms up as he was basically nose to nose with me and he kept punching them down leaving bruises on the tops of my arms. I eventually fought back and he grabbed my neck and put me into a head lock, I got up ran upstairs and took our 2 children in the car and left. I texted him telling him to leave and he was crazy. He eventually left the house and I took the children home and told him we where over and he was to find somewhere else to stay, and that if he came back I’d call the police. He turned up at the house hours later sober and crying and begging to speak to me, asking for his stuff and causing a scene out in the street. I eventually let him in after a hour or so of him crying at the door. We are on lockdown and he has nowhere to go, I told him we where finished and he’s went too far, alcohol isn’t a excuse for what he did and even though this happened once, once is enough. He’s trying to find somewhere else to live and I’ve not spoken a word to him since it happened. I want him to leave but I don’t want him homeless during this pandemic. I know what he did is unforgivable but how do I even stay in the same house as him? He’s not the same person to me anymore I’m completely sickened by him. My emotions are all over the place and I really don’t know what I’m seeking from this post. Am I doing the right thing or am I crazy for still allowing him here? He’s never been violent before and he’s a great father our kids haven’t witnessed this or know of it. I think I’m still in shock if I’m honest, I know he’s been a bit depressed through this we all have but I never ever expected this from him. Does anyone have any advice?

g3ifou,I think my roommate is being abused but won't ask for help. Is there anything I can do? Am I just imagining it?,"Recently my roommate has been having a new guy over sometimes, and while I was in the kitchen making some food for myself this morning I saw her with a massive black eye.  
  
She brought it up herself and said she ""took a tumble"" on her bike... Maybe I'm imagining everything and that is what happened... But I'm really suspicious because we instinctively do everything we can to prevent our heads from being hurt when we fall. And even if she did fall on her head wouldn't it be more likely that she would have hurt her forehead or something? I dunno, it just seems very strange - especially with the timing of her seeing this new guy. She's quite a timid girl and the guy gives me really bad vibes...  
  
I only just moved in pretty recently and didn't know her at all before that so we're polite but aren't close by any means. So I don't think she'd be willing to open up to me about this.  
  
One other detail is that she's overweight so maybe that could play into the injury being more likely or her self-esteem being lower to the point of being willing to date someone abusive. I really don't know...  
  
What can I do? Should I just wait and see what happens? What if she is being abused and gets hurt worse?",ReasonOverwatch,2020-04-17 22:43:45,11,251,4.03,57.89,45.48,1,14.76,12.35,98.41,65.34,24.3,15.54,7.17,1.99,0,6.37,0,8.76,3.59,9.56,15.94,7.57,8.37,2.39,24.3,5.98,2.79,1.99,0.4,1.99,6.77,1.2,4.78,0.8,1.2,1.59,14.74,0,2.39,6.77,1.2,17.93,3.59,0.8,2.39,7.17,1.59,5.18,3.59,1.99,0.4,1.2,3.19,1.99,0.8,0,1.2,7.97,3.19,0,2.39,1.59,1.2,3.98,15.54,0.4,13.15,1.99,6.37,4.78,0,0.8,1.2,0,0,0,0.4,0,0.4,0,0,0.4,17.13,7.57,0.8,0,0,2.39,0,0.8,0.8,4.78,0,0

We are brothers and we have our times when he is actually nice to me and we spend time together, However it only lasts less than a few hours before we fight again.

As I am getting older and experencing things a normal teenager would experience like School stress, rejection and being bullied by that one guy in middle school. I've been having more and more mental breakdowns and been experiencing depression. During this depression period I had been accumulating many different thoughts and ideas, things that at first seemed horrific and thoughts that were to dark for me to understand when I was younger. The consistent verbal abuse for my parents and brother made me think about taking my own life, but I soon realized that it is pointless to take my own life but what happened if took my brothers life.

g3m9bl,Help us change policies for domestic violence during covid19!,"We're survivors and shelter workers. We're looking for help!

The number of crisis calls to domestic violence hotlines have spiked in the United States during the coronavirus crisis, and shelters have been shut down in the face of the pandemic. Domestic violence non-profits everywhere are facing limited resources, and national and state governments are ignoring the issue. Google searches for domestic violence help have increased by 75% while shelters are completely overwhelmed. Now more than ever, there is an urgent need for help. The UN estimates that worldwide, 50,000 women are killed every year, and thousands are killed in the US every year. We know so many people who have been personally affected by this issue, and as a volunteer at shelters, we have watched as many of these organizations have been forced to shut down or cease operations. 

The Policy Coalition to End Abuse is team of \~40 undergraduates working with shelters and lawmakers to create policy proposals and petitions for all 50 states.

g3oqyx,Extreme Severe Trauma Attack First time,"I had a very very severe case of trauma panic attack because of Domestic Violence, my mom put a knife sort of sharp object pushed me to the wall when I was injured and couldn't have escaped. I screamed on the top of my lungs for help. My body was shaking uncontrobally. Without the help of my cousins, my other family members assisting me to calm me down I would certainly have had a very rough time. At the same I was already suffering from anxiety and being stuck in my room 24 hrs a day because of quarantine. I was afraid, I didn't know what was happening to me, as of even right now my hands are still shaking uncontrobally as it just happened 10 minutes ago or so. My intention for writing this is to  calm my nerves and at the same time seek help and document what I am right now feeling. I'm 16 years old and for the first time of my life this is the first time I've experienced such a very severe case of trauma. My stomach was empty during all of this, I have a cast on my left hand after fracturing my 4th metacarpal bone and at the same day I had my worst panic trauma whatever attack which is today I had an accident stubbing my toe. My movement was deprived due to this meaning that when domestic violence was put up against me it took 100% of my will power to grab my mom's wrist and scream at the top of my lungs and run down the stairs. My family thought it was a fire but it was domestic violence. We had an argument or more of like a tantrum of me when I got my injury I would like to admit that as a 16 year old and of conscience i was in a state of rational thinking wait this isn't right I shouldn't be doing this I'll fix my room etc. I got hugged against the wall with a knife/sharp object very close to my throat. I was scared, cold, clueless when my severe trauma attacked. The uncontrollable shaking lasted for hours before it gradually slowly got better all thanks to my kind and loving cousins. But during that time including my nasal polyps makes it hard to breathe I was very sure I might pass out and I was unable to move due to the shaking of my body. Even with deep breaths it took a while for me to be in control. It seemed that eating food was the most important of all. Eating food calmed me down most likely because I'm hungry.

g3u79d,How can I help my long-distance girlfriend escape her abusive family?,"My girlfriend (24F) is being abused by family members, mostly her mother, and her circumstances have gotten even worse because of COVID. She lives 5-6 hours away from me, so she can’t escape to my place easily when things are bad. There was another horrible incident last night, and it has me fearing for her physical and mental well-being.

I want her to move in with me as soon as possible, but there are complicating factors:

(1) She doesn’t have a job here yet, and has very little money in the bank. Almost no one is hiring right now, and I can’t afford to support both of us.

(2) My roommate wouldn’t be thrilled with having an additional person living with us.

(3) My girlfriend has a dog. For a number of reasons, she wouldn’t be able to bring the dog with her, and she would never consider giving the dog up.

Also, my girlfriend has acknowledged many times that her family is abusive. She’ll sometimes tell me that one day, when she’s a little better off financially, she’s going to leave and never speak to her family again. But then, eventually, a week or two after whatever horrible incident, she’ll start making excuses. She keeps hoping they’ll change; she’ll say she doesn’t want to cut them off “because they’re family.” She even once talked about bringing our hypothetical kids to visit their incredibly abusive grandmother once or twice a month. I was floored!! 

So basically, I’m worried that even if I do find a way around the issues I mentioned, she’s going to go crawling back to them.

g436a9,Should I be worried about getting hurt?,"Im 28(f) and my husband is 30. We’ve been married for two years, together 4.  We live on the other side of the country away from all my friends and family because of his job..  We’re only about an hour from his family so we see them a lot. We’ve been here for two years so it’s safe to say I’m pretty isolated except for texting and calling my friends.  I’m worried that being out here on my own has blurred my vision about what’s actually happened.  

We fight a lot, about anything really.  I’m very stubborn and pretty argumentative when it comes to politics or other hot subjects. He gets pretty loud and usually just throws stuff in my direction or punches a wall or calls me terrible names like retard-lady.  He often tells me he thinks I have Aspergers or autism (I don’t, he’s just likes to use it as an insult). 

One time he accidentally crossed over me while showing me some new gadgets on his unloaded gun.  I grew up with guns and know that you never point it anyone, even accidentally. I got really mad at him and and told him the next day that he needs to know his gun safety better.  This pissed him off.  He said he should have pulled the trigger while pointing at me. 

Now that we’re in quarantine together we got into a fight the other day, it got pretty heated and I was definitely provoking him with my words.  I went into another room and he followed me, I said I didn’t want to talk and covered my ears and stated humming (very immature, I know, I’m embarrassed I acted that way). He started grabbing and batting my wrists. I was sitting on the bed and he lunged at me, putting his face on my face and started spitting food on my face as he screamed as loud as he could.  I thought the neighbors were gonna call the cops.  It sounded like bloody murder.  He then took my new iPhone and threw it out the room at a wall and refused to give it back to me until I had thought about what I had done.  He also unplugged the connection for the bedroom tv so that I wouldn’t have anything in there other than books. I was freaked.  It’s two days later and I still can’t stop feeling nauseous about it.  I think I can ride this out for a few months until Covid is over , but should I be worried about being severely hurt? He’s never actually physically hurt me.",bosjan21,2020-04-18 23:50:04,6,444,17.96,49.1,80.34,2.96,15.86,15.54,93.02,60.59,25,18.47,10.59,1.8,0.23,5.63,0.23,6.53,4.28,13.06,8.78,7.43,8.56,1.35,18.24,4.05,2.03,0.68,1.58,1.35,6.53,2.03,4.5,0.9,1.8,0.9,14.41,0.9,0.68,0.23,5.86,11.94,1.8,0.9,1.58,3.83,0.9,3.83,3.6,0.45,1.8,1.35,2.7,1.8,0.68,0,0.23,7.66,4.05,0.23,1.35,1.58,0.68,5.86,9.46,0.45,17.12,2.48,8.56,6.31,0.68,1.13,1.58,0,0,0.23,1.13,0.9,0.23,0,0,0,14.19,6.08,2.25,0,0,0.45,0,0.23,0,3.83,1.35,0
g46aag,My dad's abuse has reared its head again after being stood down from his job,"I'm writing this post because I'm not sure how to help my mum and sister with the current situation they're in. Any thoughts or words of wisdom would help a great deal.

I live interstate, a good 12 hour's drive from my parents and sister. Both my mum and sister are currently experiencing a surge of verbal abuse from my dad who a few weeks ago, was stood down from his job thanks to the unfortunate combination of working in a pub and COVID-19. The conditions of being stood down means he can't access sick leave or holiday leave and he's been stuck at home with no income. He's voiced his anger at the situation and has said to me on the phone he's going crazy being stuck in the house all the time. He also has a medical condition that's limiting his mobility—not that it excuses his behaviour. 

My parents are of the generation where you don't divorce ""for the sake of the children"" and they're from a very proud and stubborn Eastern European background. My mum has stuck with my dad despite the fact he loves to verbally abuse us and enjoys playing the pity card when he's called out on his behaviour. Quite often, we become the arseholes in his eyes who have ""no respect"" or ""think we know everything"". 

He literally turns into the worst monster if you trigger him by being a little too honest or a little too sarcastic or, God forbid, ungrateful for everything he does—part of me wonders if these bursts of intense anger and hatred are heightened from years of alcohol abuse. I used to run into the kitchen as a kid, when my dad would yell at my mum in his drunken, disgusting daze, thinking I could stop it. I'd tell him to leave her alone and then, of course, it would be my fault. Tonight's phone call to my mum and sister is bringing back those emotions and memories—I'd thought I'd worked through them with my psychologist but it seems like it's a lifelong battle to get there.

I can't count how many times this cycle of abuse happens. And I can't even explain in words how deep his voice gets and how much blood-curdling hatred comes through when he shouts. He is actually terrifying.

My mum's been worn down by his treatment of her, she literally doesn't make an effort on her appearance or anything and in the past, she's said that she doesn't want to be alone. 

My sister—is deeply depressed, gets epilepsy that's triggered by stress and struggles to get out of bed, most days. 

It's breaking my heart knowing my sister's caught mum crying this week, while she herself, is crying on the phone telling me what's been happening. Meanwhile, dad talks to me on the phone like everything's peachy. 

I worry about them and I literally don't know what to do. The reason why it feels different this time is because I know my sister and my mum are quite fragile and there's no income they can rely on for support.

g47kst,Suspect domestic violence near my sister's house (URGENT),"I(22F) live in India. My sister(32F) lives in Malaysia along with her husband(34F). They are new to the country and have only been living there for 1 year. They live in a building which has a private lift for each floor however you can go to other floors by stairs. 
My sister told me that she heard cries for help from the home above her floor. And she asked her husband to contact someone. But the husabns refused saying that they can't do anything. She then said that let's go we will ask if everything's fine or not. Then again he refused implying that it's a personal matter. And then the cries stopped.
He then told her that he has heard the cries earlier a few times too when she wasn't home.
My sister doesn't know what to do. She wants to help but is also scared as it is a muslim country ans they are not even citizens there. I know you will advice to call the police. However they won't because they are scared of being targeted. 
Is there anything else that can be done? Anonymously reporting it or something like that?

g4p4lh,I dialed 911 for the first time in my life today and I hope I helped someone.,"My sister and I live in a pretty large apartment complex near my school. We take turns taking my dog out for walks/bathroom in the mornings. Today was my turn. I decided to take a longer way because the weather was nice. 

I get to a spot with a large patch of grass and let my dog shit for the 3rd time and as I'm starting to walk away to head towards my place I'm not sure what made me turn around but I notice a couple in the distance, about 50 or so meters away. For about 15-20 seconds it looked to me like they were just play-fighting because there was no screaming but as soon as I heard the girl start ""stop! please stop!"" my senses all seemed to get away from me. I wasn't sure what to do. I didn't know whether it was serious enough to call the cops. I've never had to call the cops in my life. 

I keep watching and the girl manages to get away from her partner and gets inside her apartment. I notice the perpetrator seemed to get into a car or something, I wasn't sure as we were separated by a parking lot and trucks were in the way of my view. They then turn towards the apartment and I notice they're stumbling a bit and they have a bottle of what looked like Jose Cuervo Reposado 3/4 of the way empty. They attempted to get inside the apartment with their own keys but it looked like the girl was holding the door closed or they were just too drunk to get their key in. 

At this point I'm walking back and forth trying to be inconspicuous, debating whether to call or not. The perpetrator manages to get in and I hear more screaming from inside. This time it's ""get off of me"". I call 911. As I'm calling the girl gets out of the apartment and seems to put some clothes in her car and the perpetrator follows. She tells them to stay away. I give as many details as I can to the operator and I'm off the phone in about 4 minutes. As I'm waiting for the cops to show I just decide to stand directly in view of the apartment (still about 20 yards away). There's more screaming and I can slightly see them over the fence, getting physical in the patio. 

At this point I see a white truck pull up and a man come out, the exchange seemed to be like one guy was buying something from another or one was returning something they borrowed. Whatever it was, it bothered me they were literally 5 ft away from the screaming and they were acting completely normal. 2 seconds later a lady comes out with a baby in her arms. I'm seriously like ""they're not going to even attempt to help their neighbor who's screaming and is clearly in some sort of danger?"" and I notice the couple walk back into the same apartment where the altercation is happening. They live with this couple. 

I move away and stand at an intersection where I'm hoping the cops will come in through. I see them and they head in the right direction. I watched for about 10 minutes to see if they would take the perpetrator away but I couldn't tell what was happening. 

I feel like shit for not staying to make sure the girl was okay. I feel like a moron for not asking the cops what was happening. I feel like maybe I didn't do enough and the girl is still in danger. I feel conflicted for leaving it solely in the hands of police who might not be competent enough to deal with a domestic violence issue, who might let it go if the perpetrator has a strong enough grip on the victim and she decides to not press charges. Domestic violence is not a private matter, its a matter of public health and wellbeing. 

I'm glad that I was there at the right time because no one else was there to witness them fighting in the parking lot. Even with the screaming, no one seemed to care. More people should care.",lbrmp,2020-04-20 01:36:52,0,732,78.93,29.7,91.85,17.79,17.43,13.8,91.26,58.47,15.16,11.34,7.79,0.27,0,0.82,2.46,3.83,8.47,18.17,8.06,3.96,6.83,2.32,19.81,3.42,3.01,1.78,2.32,1.91,4.92,2.19,2.73,0,0.82,0.14,8.61,0.27,0.41,1.91,0.27,10.79,2.6,0.68,0.96,3.83,1.23,3.69,4.1,1.78,1.23,0.96,2.19,0.96,1.09,0,0.14,6.01,0.82,0.55,2.32,2.05,0.55,4.92,11.89,1.09,17.08,3.14,10.52,3.96,0.82,0.41,1.78,0.41,0,0,0.55,0.41,0,0.14,0,0,11.34,5.33,1.23,0,0,0.14,0.27,0.27,0.82,2.73,0.27,0.27
g4s9t4,Interesting article on battle fatigue in domestic abuse victims,"I've been out of my long term abusive relationship for 10 months now. I found this article yesterday. I have found the section on brainwashing to be comforting, as well as the explanation that battle fatigue can result in women focusing their attention on survival rather than escape. I know I personally have a lot of self resentment for not being able to escape sooner, and others regularly ask ""why didn't you just leave?""  I hope someone else can find something that they need to help them heal in this, although it is not directed towards the audience of abuse survivers.

g5782o,I don’t know where to go anymore..,"2 years after a toxic, mentally abusive, later turned physical, relationships has been resurfacing over and over again, and each time has triggered ptsd and unresolved trauma (I’ve tried.. yet to find a facility that actually helps or is effective). 

I had to remove a mutual friend today because I just can’t. 

I feel weak, stupid and as if I’m not good enough for or have any real purpose in this world?

I used to have a very different, much brighter and optimistic view and approach to life.  Before getting in that relationship I had such a thirst and hunger for living and chasing my dreams — I’ve been diagnosed with depression since I was little and although I thought I had a good grip and balance, it was pretty much stomped on during that relationship... literally to the point where friends noticed the drastic change... like a broken bulb.. can’t really do much but watch, help or let it be.. 

Through all of that I felt my spirit, self esteem, love and light slowly die out. Never did I imagine how painful death while still being alive would feel like... it felt as if I was drowning. Slowly sinking. No joke. I can be dramatic, super. But when it comes to matters of the mind and heart I don’t. 

There were nights were my soul would leave my body from the amount of pain and tears I’d pour out, to what they presumed to be for them, but really it was a cry for help. To God. To someone. Anybody that would catch on. Because if I said anything about it I’d never hear the end of it. It’d be turned against me to the point where I’d have to apologize and promise to never bring it up or do it again(tf??) And who would believe me anyway? They’re perfectly perfect, attractive, funny and amicable.. and well, I’m mostly quiet and reserved.. unless I feel like I can be myself w you, which I didn’t with them.. super major red flag I kept ignoring out of maybe this is the real me? (Yea no. But they did a great job at defining me..) 

In retrospect, it felt like being sucked dry.. Of course I could’ve walked away or demanded respect, etc.. like I have in the past, but this was different.. 

I’d never met someone with narcissistic tendencies like this.. where literally everything. was. my.fault.

 My lack of this and that. My inability to do this or that. To be this or that. It was like never. Good. Enough. 


I thought once it ended I’d be able to breathe again, but it’s been worse... I feel “haunted” by the ghost of who they are or used to be, and all that happened. That to this day is “my fault”. I’m the manipulative, abusive one. 


Imagine convincing an empath they’re actually a monster? Idk how they accomplished that. But it’s never left my heart.. and I can’t seem to build or even get past hello with new friends or potential lovers. I don’t feel good enough to serve my community or the field of study I’m going for. To live. To be anything beautiful and extraordinary.. 

So my rhetorical question would be: would i be able to do so in an alternate universe, instead? 

Doesn’t help that I’ve also been going through some intense “spiritual” transformations that came/activated unannounced..

So a spiritual awakening plus the taunting of the ghosts of my past that just wont leave... am I crazy or just a tad? 


Side note: the best way to describe or sum up that experience and how it left me feeling — Harley Quinn opening scene of Birds of Prey. 

I was fine.. then everything changed. And not all for the best. And I’m tired. 

I really don’t know what to do anymore... i want to breathe again. Without the horror of those memories hovering over me..

I hope this makes sense.. I barely touched the surface but I thought I’d still give it a try given how I feel.. 

A bitch is tired man.",betsyletsy,2020-04-20 19:55:33,0,693,19.96,8.53,94.48,38.61,10.04,15.87,92.64,61.62,18.9,10.82,9.81,0,0.14,0,0.87,8.08,4.76,12.99,12.27,6.49,9.67,3.17,20.63,4.76,2.6,2.02,0.43,1.44,6.2,3.46,2.74,0.14,0.72,0.43,5.48,0,0.58,0,0.14,18.04,4.18,2.45,1.88,4.76,2.02,6.06,3.75,0.87,0.43,2.16,3.03,0.87,1.73,0.14,0.29,7.94,2.31,1.73,2.45,2.02,0.58,6.49,11.83,0.87,12.41,2.74,4.62,5.34,0.72,0.43,0,0,0.72,0.87,1.01,0.29,0.43,0.14,0.14,0.29,24.53,13.56,3.46,0.29,0,1.15,0,0,0.87,4.18,0.87,0.14

g5iygr,"Posted on relationships, it got taken down and they suggested I post here. So I need some advice.","Hi reddit,

Me (M23) and my partner (F23) have been together for 5 years now, since the first year of our college. We have had our share of troubles but nothing so far has been too much for us to handle, amongst ourselves.

Lately, since the corona thing has started off we've been apart, this is not new for us since we're from different cities and have had to do long distance before, but this time it felt off ,for the both of us. After a fair amount of drama we spoke clearly about it and have come to few conclusions.

1. We really love and care about each other, and do not wnat to cause any unnecessary pain or hurt each other
2. We both need to improve on some fronts, for me it's long distance communication, I suck at being in touch in general though it's completely different when I'm with someone.
This we've agreed that both of us will work on ( she on hers and me on mine)
3. Where are we going from here?  Now this is the major problem. Discussing this we came to the 2 major road blocks that we have:

a. She's scared of me, this started recently due a incident, let me explain. I am not an alcoholic, but you could call me a drinker, as in I drink on the weekends sometimes once in 2 weeks, and most of the time I am fine, if I get too drunk I just end up passing out on the bed or so, but there have been a couple of times, I think 3 to be precise, when I have gone black out drunk, and mean black out, I don't remeber shit about what happened after a certain point even though apparently I'm up and about and has ended me getting hyper and aggresive
While the previous two incident were also really bad I did manage to sort of deal with them. I guess I have some deep issues that I need to deal with but yeah, but the last one was the worst.
So after I blacked out, I aparently at first was running around hyper and probably talking stupid shit, this was at a friend's house where all my friends were also there. My friends and my gf after a while managed to put me to sleep and everything was still fine till then. But at some point I wake up again and start walking up and down from the bed to the bathroom door and back, talking gibberish, this scared my gf who was laying beside me, then I probably banged my head or fiat on a chest of drawers against the wall and told her  that I was gonna go through this door and she better open it for me otherwise I'd get angry or some shit like that. Then I flop back onto the bed then get up again and repeat this multiple times. Then I flop back and probably am quite for some time  and then I suddenly flip over and grab her throat, I let it go quickly too, probably a few seconds, atleast that what I think she told me. Then I get up and tell her that ""all actions have repercussions and she wasn't above it"". This legit freaked her the fuck out and she called my friends to handle me while she went to a different room to calm down. Things calmed I fell asleep and that nightmare ended. Next day I think she was ready to break up with me, but we somehow worked through it, I told her I'd leave drinking if she wanted that  but being realistic, never ever drinking seemed kinda far fetched. We have spoken about it multiple times after that, she says she still feels she'll be scared of I ever drink, coz otherwise she's fine, but if I do drink she might freak out. I have told her that I'll never drink around her and even control my intake otherwise, but we don't know if this might happen again and she's not sure how long she'll feel afraid of drunk me or if she'll ever get over it. This is our first major roadblock


b. Marriage. Were not in a rush or anything but she does want to be married by 27 latest by 29, while for me, I don't beleive in marriage. I love her and have told her I can be with her forever , but I don't belive in the concept of marriage, going to court and getting the government involved in my personal life. I just don't like it. I have always had this stance, ever since a kid, but I do love her and want to be with her. The thing is I have kinda agreed to get married to her, but do not want to do it till I am settled down in my life and financially stable to be able to handle everything. Marriage is not a priority for me and the problem is I am so against it that I cannot assure her that even if we are together say till 30 that I'd want to get married. I have made it clear that it's got nothing to do with being only with her, I can do that, but i do not want to get married coz I don't belive in marriage. She does and even if she holds it off for long her family is not gonna be cool with it and it will become a problem in the future.

So there we are, currently on a break for a week to sort through this and see what we can do about it. I could ask my friends for advice but I'd rather ask the internet where I'll be anonymous and can expect unbiased advise on what best for the both of us individually and as a couple.
So please let me know what you think we should do.

I feel shittier that it's domestic violence.

Tl;dr : 5 year relationship, love each other have two major road blocks. I made a blackout drunk mistake that cost me heavy coz now she's scared of me, and marriage seems uncertain coz I can't assure her about it.

g5rhxr,I Made A Mistake,"Last July, I kicked my bipolar, borderline, and abusive fiance out of the apartment and he moved back in with his parents in another state. There, he finally got back on medication and got his health stabilized. So stabilized, in fact, that we decided to go on a one month vacation together in February. After the vacation, he was supposed to go back to his family and continue his recovery and treatment.

Then COVID-19 happened, and guess who got stuck with me during a mandatory stay at home order that has been extended into May and possibly longer? 

The vacation was wonderful, and he was stable. When shit started to go down, he started having panic attacks and his anxiety was through the roof. He has severe, uncontrolled asthma so it's a serious threat to his health. We self isolated the week before the stay at home order thinking it would pass by quickly and were very wrong. 

Ever since his mental health has slowly deteriorated. After the panic attacks came self harm, insomnia, hypersomjia, mania, depression, you name it. He was always careful about not hurting me, though it hurt me to see him hurting himself and struggling so much. It finally reached a climax today where he just fucking snapped and held me at knife point for half an hour while I begged for my life. 

He mentioned how angry he is that I get upset when he keeps me awake when I am trying to sleep before work and ask him to go into the living room until he is ready to sleep, but he's also pissed off that for the 2-4 hours a day that I work in the living room he has to stay in the bedroom. My sleep and my job are two things I can't compromise on, but apparently they are fucking life ending deal breakers in his mind.

I guess I just needed to rant. As soon as this is all over he's going back to his family's house and that's that. I'll be stuck continuing to try and pick up the pieces and struggling to save up money for a car so that once I graduate in December I can actually get a high paying job and not cause my parents to lose their houses from defaulting on student loans.",DailyAdventures,2020-04-21 17:48:14,1,395,49.82,60.01,55.11,1,20.79,16.46,93.16,56.2,17.97,13.67,5.57,0.51,0.25,6.84,0.51,4.3,5.32,14.68,6.84,6.58,8.86,0.76,16.71,4.05,1.77,1.52,1.77,1.01,7.59,0.76,6.84,2.03,2.28,1.52,10.89,1.01,0.25,0,7.09,7.59,0.51,1.27,0.76,2.28,1.01,1.77,1.01,0.25,0,0.76,4.56,1.27,2.78,0.51,0,9.11,2.03,1.52,3.8,1.27,1.01,6.08,10.13,1.27,21.52,3.54,10.13,9.62,1.77,1.01,2.28,0.76,0,0,1.01,1.01,0,0,0,0,11.65,4.3,4.81,0,0,0.25,0,0.51,0,1.77,0,0

g65ip5,"Former abuse survivors, How did you ever broach the subject with your current S/O without feeling scared of how things'll change?","Hey Everyone,

Sorry, this is long. But the first para is a good TLDR. 

I need your advice, as former abuse survivors. How did you ever broach the subject with your current S/O without feeling scared of how things'll change? My bf found out by accident the other day about the extent it went to and I'm scared. I never really went into my past to my current bf. I just said they didn't have a good relationship and would fight all the time.

I never told him about my dad who would beat my mom all the time and how he stopped and got help after the authorities got involved, and I'm really proud of him and my mom for working it out :'), but its still been a really big, shameful secret I have. That I come from a family like that, etc, that I'm not normal, etc.

I'm trying my best to go about in the world as a person who comes from a well-adjusted background, not as someone who came from such an...impoverished background, and it works. I have mostly gotten over my PTSD, I don't get the shakes anymore from loud, sudden, noises. (Still pretty scared of loud, strong men, though lol. I also absolutely detest watching any violence on TV) I'm pretty much depression free. I haven't had any suicidal ideation, no urges to hurt myself, etc. Those melancholy episodes where it feels like you're walking through a murky swamp? GONE!

I put in a lot of work into myself for two years after I turned 18 and went to college. I went to the hospital, stayed in the psych ward for 10 days until I could transfer to dorming. I went to Outpatient therapy for 3 months and did DBT, all while attending college part-time. I also earned money and lived alone during the summer so I didn't have to go home while taking classes then too. I got a therapist the following year, started to do Yoga again, Meditation, Pranayam, and even went to a self development course called Landmark. I became closer to God again. I changed my life, thanks to God's grace. It was a lot of work to get myself in a healthy state before I carefully decided to date again this past Fall semester of 2019.

And I met him. We had the same class together, and I wasn't initially attracted to him. I just thought he was intimidatingly smart. We happened to be introduced through mutual friends. We all as a friend group would hang out together, and as time went on we spent more and more time together alone, just studying and goofing off. I was pleased by how many of our values towards the world, life, and living aligned. How we could talk about all sorts of interesting things. It just felt...easy. Natural. I felt myself, for the first time, falling for someone with my mind, not from the intoxicating mix of chemicals that come from an initial attraction.

I quelled any feelings I thought were coming up, though, because he had a gf at the time, but he broke up with her sometime later. We started talking a little bit later, cuz he had feelings for me too. I was really hesitant to enter the relationship, though. For one, he just broke up with his ex. Another, I was just flat out scared of being physically involved with someone. I'd been in a relationship before where my sexual boundaries hadn't been respected, and I was working on asserting myself and being ready to discard anyone who didn't respect them. But it was the next level to do that sexually versus telling someone no to hanging out, lol.

But he stayed. He was patient. He listened when I called him out. He never, ever got mad and raised his voice at me. He was okay with us just being platonic until I was ready. He was actually the one who took me to the place on campus for the sexual assault victims cuz I was too scared to go alone. He made a mistake or two, but he nonetheless was hyper aware of how important respecting my boundaries were to me. Not even my family was that respectful of them. I didn't even know I could be treated so well until he came around.

It was definitely a tumultuous few early months of talking, given all these things, but come Spring semester when we decided to make it official, there was just calm. I was finally ready to be physical with him and it was mindblowing. I didn't know I could feel so good. It was awesome, like a friend that I could cuddle and have sex with and talk about the stars and our dreams and growth and roll down grassy hills and climb trees with. It was so chill. Other than the initial confusion, in our talking stages (given where we were in our lives) there was never any other conflict. I never knew someone who so wholeheartedly supported me in my ideas and invested so much time in me. Each time I would cringe and try something new, a new boundary ('sorry, I'm tired, I can't hang out', or, 'I need to concentrate now'), and new expression of myself, it was just met with acceptance and joy.

But there was always that fear in the back of my mind...what if he snaps one day? What if he just up POWs me across the hall like my dad would my mom? What if its so far in the relationship that we have kids or something? What if he finds out and then takes advantage of my past to...idk....control me, shame me, hit me, hurt me. What if, what if, what if...you get the idea. But I couldn't tell him all this because I was ashamed of my past.

Then he found out. He just up asked me, 'Hey, has your dad ever hit your mom? Or vice versa?'.

He asked because he'd witnessed his neighbors in a DV altercation during quarantine and he texted me about it for advice, but he didn't get to the point (who was involved? was it just something he watched on tv or was it in his house?) because he wanted to text it like a story...smh. I obviously misinterpreted the text and thought he said it was his family because he said he 'saw it with his own two eyes'. I told him that yes, such a thing had happened in my home as well. THEN he backtracked and said it was his neighbors.

I got angry. I felt betrayed. I didn't know what to do, my deepest fear, him finding out, was out. He responded with how sorry he was and insensitive he was for not thinking of my emotions. He told me how proud he was of how much I'd done in the past two years. How I'm working to make the world a better place now. How I shouldn't feel ashamed for how my family was like that because unlike many, we were blessed to rise from that place in our lives.

But...I don't know how to act now. With him. I'm not ready to face these fears of mine. I think. It's just so emotionally intense. I wanna focus on school and learn the most I can and enjoy my career. I think I should just break up with him even though it sucks, cuz I'm not emotionally ready for such a facet in our relationship. We've only been officially going out for like 3 months really. Its too intense. I just wanna roll in the grass and talk about our dreams, not have stupid therapy sessions of my past. I have a therapist for that. I just wanna keep things light-hearted, not too attached. If he knows about my past, I'll be too attached and I want to pace these things. Those wounds of mine have scabbed over and the crust has fallen off, but the skin is still tender and pink.

I don't know. He's good for me, but am I ready for a good thing yet? I still have so much to work on internally.

I am 2 years, 2 months, and 3 days free of my abuser. It's been a long journey and still more to go, but I wanted to share a book I recently finished. Part of my recovery has led me to a newfound love of hiking and I started a book, last week, about the first female solo thru hiker of the Appalachian Trail. ""Grandma Gatewood's Walk"" by Ben Montgomery.  She's 67, alone, no special gear or training, but so clearly a survivor with the most amazing strength of will. 

Later in the book you find out that she was a victim of domestic abuse for many years. The read hit me hard, but in a great way. It reminded me that we're survivors tapping into incredible strength even while we struggle and fight for the most basic freedoms. It made me proud of myself and I wanted to share the book with you in case you need inspiration.

g6pfdp,Pray for me again as I attempt to kick her out for the third time.,"How many times does they say it takes someone to leave before they finally leave for the last time? I think its 7 and I've gotta be on number 7 or 8. Yeah its gotta be a lot by now counting the exact situations just will upset me. 

Either way long story short story. We met, turned into a thing, already there was drama but I ignored it and pushed it off as other people involved, then I moved in with them, paid all bills paid for really everything. Got verbally and emotionally abused and manipulated and mistreated all the time. She stole money from me, even got physical to the point of pushing me and shoving me into a wall once. I was cut off from my family and friends, had no money or resources for myself as a 18 y/o w no diploma just college creds lmao. 

But I struggled, stayed at a friends for like 3 weeks, then I moved an hour away with a roommate, few months later i had my own apartment. 

Depression, loneliness or homesickness got the best of me and I was so vulnerable. She knew it . I let her come over but every time I did she would want to stay the night then the whole next day, she would say she was about to leave and then somehow fall asleep and wake up during 5 o'clock traffic and wouldnt want to drive through that to saying oh no it's too late to go back and I dont want to drive in the dark. 

Of course if that was me I know I wouldnt want to drive in the dark, I get anxious and can barely see so why would I make someone else do it? Whatever anyways. Then when I would push the hint of when are you leaving what is your plans she would guilt trip me and whatnot. I started never wanting to bring it up. Somehow she just brought more of her shit inside and then we were stuck. 

Or I'm stuck. 

Now within the past month we have had two incidences involving police. She has gotten physical with me, my dog, has taken toilet paper out of the house, poured out dog food, taken laundry detergent, my face wash, food whatever right. Said the most hurtful things.  And I'm done. Emotionally, financially, I literally am a physical ball of manifested stress. 

But I let her back this last time because... well. I wanted to smoke but also she needed to get her shit and I told her she would need to bring dog food back. And honestly I'm scared of her. Maybe not scared so much of what she could do but scared of her thoughts, what she will say, if she tries to get seriously physical with me I dont want to catch a charge defending myself and my dogs. and I thought itd be safer for me to just stay civil. Handle the separation and kicking her out with grace or whatever so then she wont get obsessive and crazy. (She stalked her ex before ) 

But now she is back. She is causing me so much anxiety and I'll give it a couple days tops til something else happens. I cant involve my family anymore.

g6s3ar,The difficulties of escaping an advanced abuser,"I don’t mean that he’s more violence than others. I’ve been here before and read your posts. A lot of you have day-to-day lives way harder than mine, and my heart breaks for you too every day.

But while my abuser isn’t violent all the time, he certainly can be, and always shows me this great capacity of his whenever I try to live or disagree with him.

But if I’m “a good girl” I get an ALMOST normal life. He even buys me presents sometimes, although I’m NEVER allowed to make a purchase on my own or even ask for anything. I get what I get and I pretend to be happy, because being sad is against the rules. 

I’m not his first victim. He told me he was abused by two women before me, but then I found out everything he said they did to him was really the other way around. I know what they went through, but they got out and I can’t.

You see, he learned from his past mistakes. Not the right mistakes, of course, but he learned how to plan ahead so the next victim wouldn’t get away.

I’ve been here before. You all have treated me with such kindness and brilliant advice. Unfortunately for me, he saw each of my moves before they happened. The other girls likely tried everything before me and now he seems almost clairvoyant, otherworldly.

He was a lot more violent in the beginning. He was setting everything up, training me, so that I would become what I am today: submissive and a GREAT actor. 

I didn’t understand what he was doing at first. I was just trying to do anything to get him to stop hurting me, to trust me, to love me. 

He made me send mean messages to all my friends and family I knew before him. He would make up reasons why none of them were worthy, and I’d have to convincingly burn every bridge off this sad secluded island. No one cares about me anymore. 

When we meet new friends, he gets them alone and tells them we’ve had issues in the past with my cheating (that never happened), but he was willing to look past it and now we have this wonderful relationship. They see him as a saint and know I’m not to be trusted, turning them into unwitting spies. If they ever see me somewhere I’m not supposed to be or talking to someone they don’t know, they tell him. They’re just looking out after all.

He made me give up my phone and take one of his so he can monitor all my calls. He checks every number he doesn’t recognize, he reads all my texts and monitors my social media. He shuts off my phone if he thinks I’m getting ready to leave. He is my only portal to the outside world.

He made me give him my bank account passwords, my credit cards, even my drivers license, SS card and birth certificate. He wouldn’t let me renew my drivers license and instead got a non drivers ID, so now I can’t even drive legally. On paper, he owns me. 

He moved me against my will to his small rural hometown. I couldn’t figure out why he would want to move here, but then I realized everyone here is either friend or family to him. The loyalty of this town is to him, and there are no resources here to help anyone. The nearest city with a single women’s shelter is an hour away. I’m in his world that only he can control.

He makes me work a job, a privilege I was ecstatic about. His best friend is my boss, his other friends are my coworkers. More spies. They don’t know he abuses me and still treat me nicer than he does, so it’s not all bad, but I still have to give him all my money and do all the housework. He keeps me busy all the time. 

I am thankful that he can at least control his violence. I can avoid being hurt if I follow the rules, but he will release it with all his fury if I break a rule. He has threatened to kill me many times, mostly when I fight back and try to get away. He had tried to choke and drown me before, so now when he says he will kill me I stop everything and do whatever he says. He keeps me in my place.

I don’t really know the “right” way to get out of this one. None of the great advice I’ve gotten from anyone seems to apply to me. I can’t call police because he said he would kill me and I know that’s not an empty threat. He has said many times that our relationship will ultimately end murder-suicide style. He’s not afraid to die, and often wishes for death. I have to keep him away from those thoughts because if he decided to kill him self, he will likely take me with him.

I can’t call hotlines or services because he will know before I even get a chance to explain anything, not to mention the fact that I’m under constant surveillance and can’t even go anywhere private to talk. I did actually call the shelters in the bigger cities hours away once, but even they said they are often full and give preference to the individuals who are physically there, not someone who is 2 hours away. They said I could call every day until there’s an opening, but I only ever got the one chance.

I fear the advanced abuser. The one who knows exactly what his victim will try to do before they even think of it themselves. There are so many other little rules and contingencies that keep me in place but this post is too long already.

I just wanted to put this out there, maybe someone who is involved in DV support can see this and figure out a way to reach those of us who are nearly invisible and unreachable victims. Those of us who only get that one chance to reach out and then it’s over.

I’m working on a plan to use quarantine to my advantage to get out of this situation. I’ve packed a bug out bag and have made a secret email and have been carefully working on some things. If this works I will try to post again, but for right now I know it’s risky and I’m not following the standard advice of involving professionals so if it doesn’t work, I don’t want to inadvertently cause someone else to make the same mistake. 

I think when I’m out of this I will be able to better think of ideas to help people like me, and I think I would want to do that. I think hefty social programs are the only real  way to really help people as entrenched in a situation as I am, though. 

Free childcare, UBI, guaranteed and quick cell phone access (burner phones), universal healthcare, free college, advanced and accessible public transport. If even some of those things existed I would probably have been able to leave by now, but when you have no money and no access to the outside world, it’s hard to do things like get a ride away from your abuser, find a place to sleep for the night, get a new job, get an apartment, avoid starvation. I can’t even apply for government aid because I have no ID or SS card or birth certificate! It’s going to be a long road JUST to get my documentation back, and it’s not free. 

If you read through my story; thank you. If there is anyone who could use any of this info to help anyone else, please share. Only I can save myself at this point, but I want my tragedy to mean something. I want this to help someone else somehow. I want to get out and directly help others but if I don’t get out then all I have is this story, and maybe some day that will help someone.",quarantine_breakup,2020-04-23 11:33:54,14,1381,17.9,42.25,61.4,15.57,17.71,12.74,94.35,61.91,23.32,17.23,9.49,0.43,0.65,5.36,1.3,6.01,4.06,12.45,9.99,6.44,7.75,2.82,19.19,4.34,2.17,1.59,0.87,2.46,5.58,2.39,3.11,0.51,1.3,0.51,14.77,0.14,0.36,0.29,5.36,17.09,2.97,1.67,2.53,4.71,2.24,5.5,1.81,0.65,0.8,0.36,0.58,0.14,0.36,0,0,8.98,2.1,1.96,2.39,2.75,0.94,3.84,14.55,1.38,12.67,1.38,5.72,5.5,2.1,0.29,0.29,0.72,0.07,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.48,5.5,4.49,0.07,0.07,0,0.07,0.22,0.29,3.48,0.29,0

He says I'm bringing up arguments from months ago..I feel like we never talk to resolve anything and it all comes out. Yes I have unplugged the computer before because I was angry and tired of being ignored all the time. He tells me to give him space we will talk later. It never happens. Yes I have called him a mommas boy before because he does not stand up to her and defend me. The family has said things I feel were hurtful but he is mad when I say that and says I'm just too sensitive. I tried distancing myself from his family and again he got angry he said the relationship was bullshit because of it. I told him he treats me like a dog and thinks hes superior to me. Hes called me a fucking bitcb and put his fist in my face. When I told him to get out he asked me ""oh are you scared of me"" like a taunt. I told him yes. The next day he says to me ""babe you know I'd never hurt you"". Do I though? He says I'm the one who treats him badly and hes going to set cameras around the house to video tape what kind of awful person I am to him. I'm sitting her going am I the abusive one? I told him at Easter time only him and his mom make the plans I'm never allowed to be in the plan making. He said I was being a fucking child because his mom excluded me. He says I'm just trying to keep him away from his family. I'm sorry I dont want them at my house. I know they dont like me and they want nothing to do with me.

g6vb6r,I'm scared of my father.,"I was born and raised in Argentina, I just saw the in the paper how they're dealing with domestic violence during the quarantine. And I wanted to  cry.
I don't know what to do or who to talk to. Maybe I'm overreacting , maybe the situation will change I do not know. I need advice.
My father since I have memory is a very explosive person, if I do something wrong like failing in some chore he will snap at me out of the blue. And in most extreme cases hit me. I know it's common in latina homes the use of sandals for example to educate. But when I was around 7 he used the belt with me and my brother, when I was 13 and I didn't do the homework he hit me until I peed my pants , when I was 16 he hit me with the phone .  When I started having depression and cut myself he hit me again but this time my brother got in the middle.
Now , at 23 he started screaming at my mother for the most stupid reasons , this pandemic is forcing me to stay in the house 24/7 and recent events has made him scream at us , get into fights , he has always been verbally abusive towards me and my brother, but seeing him scream at my mother bothers me. She did nothing wrong. And I'm scared , my brother always gets in the middle when he is about to hit me , but I don't want this anymore. I can't defend myself , I'm scared of my own father. My mom says she's going to kick him out if it gets physical again but I hate this fear and paranoia I have. I don't know what to do.

I was violent to my ex girlfriend. I'd always had issues with mood swings, depression, suicide attempts etc but I thought I'd controlled them when I met her. I was wrong. The worst incidents were when we got drunk and I choked her, hit and threw her and another when I smashed her car while she was in it. Besides this I was possessive and jealous, and I had done things like punch walls, threatening suicide..

I hate myself for what I did. I was aware that I had committed abusive acts but I didn't comprehend how our entire relationship was a classic cycle. I'd ""fuck up"", we'd break up, reunite, I'd go back to being a model boyfriend because I felt like shit. Cycle

g7ede9,My mom is threatening my dad,"My \[21F\] parents have been living in separate countries for nearly all of their marriage (my dad in the US, mom abroad), and our entire family only lives together for only short periods of time. Their relationship has been civil and friendly, but not particularly loving. We have been quarantined together in the US now for a while, and their conflict has been getting worse. My mom is very unhappy to live in the US although she feels an obligation to be here. My dad is a hyper-critical person, while my mom has a very large ego, so there is fault on both sides, but the fights are getting worse. My dad and my sister and I think they should get divorced but my mom refuses and says that it would be a source of shame for her and that she wants to ruin my dad instead of ""letting him off easy"" with a divorce. Recently my mom has been threatening to kill my dad at night in his sleep and it's making me very scared. I am usually away for college but am now home because of coronavirus. My dad let me know that last month when I wasn't home that my mom hurt herself and went to the neighbors and police to try to accuse him of physical abuse. Growing up with him, I know for a fact that he is not a violent person. He may have faults, but criminal assault is definitely not one of them.

g7h5gy,Commiting domestic violence,"I (22m) hit my girlfriend (22f) roughly a year ago. I understand this isn't the usual type of post for this subreddit, from my small experience of it anyway.

To clarify I'm not nor have ever been violent in that past. I have never instigated any violence, responded to it or allowed myself to continue to be around anyin the past. However I have been violent with myself in the past (self harm/self destructive tendencies).

Midway through December of last year I went to visit my girlfriend of 3 months. Up until that point we hadn't had any issues, we communicated well and quickly became very emotionally open (in respect to our time together of course). She lived with her parents who I'd got on extremely well with and were home when the incident occurred. Was a normal Saturday night, I finished work and came to her house for the weekend. The next lot of information could be irrelevant but I'd like to give us much info as I can. I noticed she was off with me, in fact she was making it blatantly obvious (being blunt, ignoring things I say etc). I suffer from anxiety quite bad and after a whole night of this, which include going out for a fancy meal with her family which she neglected to tell me about for some reason, I was quite on edge (just like to clarify I'm not saying any of this for sympathy, just want to paint a complete picture).

The night progressed, her parents went to bed and we ended up having some drinks and talked.We cleared up what was wrong and went back to our normal selves, happy and loving. The only difference with her is that she was really encouraging us to drink more. I've had problems with alcohol in the past(she knew quite a bit about my past) but at this point I had been almost two years with no self destructive moments despite whatever I was under the influence of. So I didn't question nor think anything would or could go wrong, I was ""nornal"" and had been for a long time. 

More time passes and we end up getting very drunk, to the point my memory is spotty about what happens next. As you can probably guess we slept together and laid chatting after, everything normal and happy.Next thing I remember is we were arguing, over what I don't know but it was rather aggressive. From here is were my memory is non-existent. 

From the statement she gave to police, we went downstairs to continue our argument, I threw an old style, metal purse sort of item (it was about the size of a wallet but rock solid) . Which struck her in the face, at the same time the fist I was throwing it with did. I left the house when told by her but refused to leave her property, choosing to stay outside calling her name and pounding on the door. The commotion caused her parents to wake up who after discovering what happened rang the police. 

They arrived, arrested me and did their usual work. I was cautioned with assault and criminal damage. Spent the night in a cell, accepted all charges and explained what happened up until the point I blacked out, after that point telling the officers that I agreed with everything she detailed. It was all fast and straight forward, me being a first time offender and them not wanting to press charges. Her eye socket was gashed and the bone around it quite badly damaged. It was a hard punch. 

Since then I have never made contact with her or her family aside from posting them money for the damage to the door I caused(the arresting officer gave me an estimate of what it would cost, a very minor amount). I still feel disgusted with myself, especially after going my whole life never acting like that towards someone else, in fact I pride myself on being very mature about violence and my commitment to avoiding it at all cost, preferring to calm situations with words or taking myself out of them. 

I've told three people the truth, my mother, best friend and therapist. Since that night I've cut myself off from the opposite sex almost completely. I refuse to use dating apps, cut off any potential romance as soon as I notice it occurring and ignore all advances made to myself when out socially. It sounds silly but up until that point I never believed I was capable of doing something like that. It's never even been a thought, whether I've been at my most angry or depressed. Never have I ever considered acting physically towards someone and yet I still acted that way but ever since then I have been. 

Not considering that I want to do it that is but scared if I do. The way I see it is that I can no longer trust myself to be around those that I care about and especially not if we are emotionally connected and under the influence. I've been visiting a therapist and counselling since but I haven't found much support for people in my situation and I understand why, I don't deserve any. How can I allow someone to get close to me again when I'm capable of acting that way.

Again, I'm not looking for sympathy but hopefully someone that has been the instigating side of domestic violence and how you go forward. What I did may seem small compared to what others have been through but that doesn't change the facts. She trusted me and I assaulted her. For a while refused to admit it was intentional, telling myself that I'd thrown an object out of anger and hit her accidentally, being drunk. She even claimed that was a possibility in her statement. 

Deep down I have this sense that it wasn't an accident, the only thing I remember is my anger, an extreme anger. I also hit her with a full fist, arm fully extended, the item would have left my hand by that point if I was throwing it surely. 

I apologise for the wall of text and if this is against the subs rules but I just don't know whether I'm making something out of nothing and that I should be worried about this happening again. I honestly don't believe it could but I said the same before. I'm constantly make efforts to better myself, notice catalysts for my negative traits and respond to them better. However the shame has never gone, nor the fear of acting the same way.

g7ojgb,The Person Who Assaulted Me Went To The Police Before Me,"I was assaulted in my sleep by my room mate. He hit me to wake me up before jumping on top of me and choking me and telling me he was going to throw me in a well. This person is allowed to carry a gun.

The reason he did this is because the night before, he and 6 guests woke me up at 1 am and I told them to quiet down.

I kicked him off me after my survival instincts kicked in, and the assaulted lasted less than two minutes; but I was asleep when it began. This person also stole the lock off of my door when he was moving out the next week.


The person who attacked me went to the police right after and filed a false police report claiming that i attacked him after a long verbal argument. He also claims to have a witness, even though MY witness was the only other person at the house at the time of the assault. In his report, he claimed that I would come forward eventually with lies and a false witness.


The cops pretty much told me to get over it. They also shamed me for waiting 2 months to come forward. The detective told me at this point if  I were to stir it up it would basically be my word against his, pointlessly expensive, and its possible that both of us would go to jail for assault just to prove I got attacked.

g7ps9s,Light at the end of the tunnel,"I met him when I was around 37. Several of my friends had already gotten married. My African mother who hadn’t so much had pressured me to get married all of my adult years had started hinting at marriage. The biological clock had started to tick, although I can’t say I heard the ticktock was from within. I had always known I wasn’t going to marry at a young age. My parents divorced when I was little, and I think I made a mental note to not get married until I was sure about whom I was getting married. But the clock ticked nonetheless because even though women are having children later in life or choosing to not have any these days, we are still bombarded with images of what “completes” a woman. Date successfully. Get the engagement ring. Have a beautiful wedding, followed by babies. The unspoken rule of thumb is to get to it.

It was surreal how I missed the signs in that situation (it would be almost too generous to call it a relationship) because of this fear of missing out. Looking back the signs were there (they always are). Was it on the first date, when I mentioned the importance of intuition during our conversation and he outright dismissed it (and so had I, as it turned out) or was it when we were on the second date, and a political topic came up and he couldn’t see an alternate point of view. I was perplexed that I had listened to his perspective, and he didn’t even seem capable of hearing mine. That was a glimpse of what was to come. But I stayed, thinking we could work things out. Plus, it was time to “settle down”. It didn’t help that when I slowly realized I was caught up in an unhealthy, toxic, dysfunctional “relationship”, I lacked the willpower to pull away. He would cross boundaries, we would fight, I’d pull away, he would apologize, then things would be back to “normal,” until the next episode – rinse and repeat. We got engaged, even made plans to start a family. But the temper tantrums and emotional volatility made me question what kind of father he would be to our children, and what type of mother I would be seeing these character traits and still moving forward with bringing innocent children - whether biologically conceived or adopted -  into that scenario. I believe this realization and the affirmations I had committed to saying and writing daily strengthened my resolve to see things for what they were and to walk away and not look back. 

It was a tough period. It seemed everything that could go wrong did. I had just being let go from a job around that time (something he couldn’t wait to throw in my face shortly after). I moved out and the space this created between us gave me the chance to at least begin the healing process. Of course, he tried to convince me to come back. I was tempted, but I was also done with that cycle. Frankly, going back would have been insanity especially since he simply refused, or was unable to comprehend there was a problem. 

What followed was a lot of soul searching and figuring out how I got sucked into that circus in the first place. I had to critically assess myself, my previous relationships, and the caliber of people I allowed into my life. The type of behavior I condoned. Whew, it was a resentment-inducing, and at times, isolating process. Holding myself accountable, gently reconnecting with my intuition, and allowing it to guide me again, and standing up for my well-being helped get me through it. 

I learned some important lessons along the way: that I ultimately was looking for validation in others and subconsciously accepted subpar treatment from them in exchange for some kind of superficial “relationship” that I believed at the time was authentic. I doubt I was the best quality of friend either since I was unwittingly hoping to get from others what I was unwilling (or unable) to give to myself because I subconsciously believed I wasn’t worthy. It was quite the revelation. I am more careful these days of whom I let into my life. I have a much better idea of what I won’t tolerate. There have been some dating missteps but I recognize and process them more quickly now.

It feels good to have closed that chapter of my life, but I won’t lose the lesson. And it’s this: as we navigate this journey of life, the only person we truly live with is ourselves and we must intrinsically love and treasure ourselves. It’s transformative healing that’s not always easy, or clear, but it’s magical if we allow and trust the process and keep putting one step in front of the other. It takes ongoing courage to hear, listen to, and heed the voice within humans don’t live life in a vacuum. Societal beliefs, mores, trends, values, affect how we show up in the world. 

Knowing this, we must always direct the extent to which they do, and it should never be to our detriment because that is a travesty to the gift of life we are given.",lightatendoftunnel20,2020-04-25 00:53:47,2,883,39.77,48.64,79.98,53.45,18.4,19.37,91.17,60.14,19.03,11.66,7.81,2.04,0,1.25,0.57,7.36,5.89,13.93,11.1,4.87,7.59,1.81,20.27,2.6,1.13,2.38,0.57,1.59,4.98,3.17,1.7,0.34,0.57,0.45,10.76,1.59,0.57,0.45,1.36,13.59,3.28,2.04,2.15,2.6,1.81,3.4,2.6,1.47,1.02,0.11,1.93,0.11,1.47,0,0,10.19,4.3,1.7,2.27,1.81,0.79,9.4,7.02,0.79,14.95,2.94,6.34,6.8,1.25,0.11,0.23,0.34,0.23,0,0.23,0.11,0,0,0.11,0,15.06,5.32,4.98,0.23,0,0,0,0.45,1.13,1.81,1.13,0
g7ymfk,Abused by my narcissist parents finally got out but fearing an honour killing,"I am a 22 year old Punjabi female who has been abused her entire life. My dad started beating me around the age of 4 or 5  before starting kindergarten, mother justified my fathers actions and supported this as she believed I deserved for speaking up for myself or not listening to their orders. Honour killing threats are always made as well, father always tell me he didn’t care if he went to jail he would be doing the right thing.I am constantly reminded I won’t amount to anything other than go into prostitution, so they have been trying to get me married off. 

Recently my father beat me for going to a career fair, the night I got back from the career fair he dragged me out of bed took me to his room, grabbed my head and started swinging punches at me and slamming my head against the bed until I fell to the ground. Proceeded to start kicking me in my stomach and back brutally. My brother and grandma just stood there and watched but my brother got involved when he saw my mother take a hit. My mother then tried to lock me up into my room and took my phone so I couldn’t leave but I managed an escape to the police station. That night I left and have no intention of going back.  I am now staying with a friend. 

My mother keepings trying to threaten me with “legal action” because she thinks I am being brainwashed against my family by the friend. Since I finally stood up for myself and left she keeps threatening to go to the police and tell them that I have been kidnapped. Our last conversation she threatened me with getting a lawyer involved to find my address of where I am staying and is very persistent on wanting to talk to the people I’ve been staying with. She’s been pinning this whole incident on me saying I’ve deserved all the beatings, justifying my fathers “personality” is and that I should know better by now.  She wants me to  stop listening to my friend whose been supporting me through this and reminding me I don’t deserve any of this.

I feel so trapped but at the same time being out of that house makes me feel so free and makes me want to focus on my studies and succeed in life. I am in a better place mentally and don’t constantly feel depressed or controlled. I want to maintain a civil relationship but idk if that’s even possible at this point? No one in my family, it is supporting me through not even my younger siblings who have blocked me on all social platforms.

g8hqq5,I called 911 after husband choked me,"Hi Reddit.  (On mobile and I barely slept, sorry for the format and grammar)

Last night I had to call the cops on my husband because he chocked me out, he did it by grabbing me from behind and putting me on a choke hold, I was fighting to make him stop and I was scared that I was going to die. He left the apartment and I called 911.

The police arrived about 20 mins later, took my statement took all of his guns, took a picture of my neck and they left. 

I got a text from him saying that he wants a divorce and that he can't be in a relationship with someone who baits him into fighting.

He did come back grab a backpack fill of stuff and left.  I had put a chair on the front door but he was able to open the door.

My friend heard everything because we were on discord playing Diablo III together and my husband broke my monitor. 

At 3 am I called the policeman because the paper work said that he strangulated me and that's a felony charge so I was scared that he will go to jail for a long time, the policeman said that he has changed the paperwork to say that he put hands on my neck.

My question is what's going to happen next?  I am in Los Angeles. 

My dad was abusive but my mom never called the cops so I have never dealt with the domestic court system. 

I am scared and I don't know what to do next.

g8ietg,Neighbors daughter is texting me asking for help.,"My daughter plays with our neighbors kids almost daily. Boy, 7 and girl, 10. Today I heard loud screaming and looked outside and saw the moms boyfriend walking down the road. We live at the end of a culdesac. Something seemed off because we’ve lived here 2 years and never seen him do that. I texted the girl and asked if everything was okay and she opened up the floodgates. He had broken all of her and her brothers toys, taken money from the mom, threatened to kill her, slapped her around,a laundry list of things. Then she says this happens pretty often he’s just usually left in his truck but he couldn’t find the keys. Hence the walking. I asked what mom was doing and the girl told me that she was telling them it would be okay and he would calm down.

Obviously the little girl doesn’t realize this is textbook domestic violence. Thankfully he didn’t lay hands on her or her brother. I did my best to comfort her through text and tell her to text me if he ever did hit her or her brother and mom didn’t do anything. She has my number saved under Dominos, and The Hotline as her school,  and she knows to delete our texts immediately. I’m afraid to contact anyone because it seems like mom won’t take any action since she hasn’t previously and i don’t want that to enrage him any further and take it out on her, or especially those kids. The kids are most afraid of being taken away from mom.

g8otho,Experiencing violence from father - affecting me daily,"Hi everyone,

This is my first time using Reddit. I'm not sure if this will help in any way but I don't know what else to do. Just looking for anyone who can relate. Since I've been ten years old, I have been experiencing violence from my father. Includes being slapped and punched in the face, having my head held down in pillows so I can't breathe, being choked till I suffocate, having my head slammed against a wall repeatedly, having plates of food and trash cans emptied over my head, being kicked in the stomach, having clothes ripped off me, etc. I have been legitimately scared I would be killed at least twice or thrice. I am now 20 years old and moved out of home, and am in university. However everything I bottled up as a child and as a teenager seems to be affecting me now. Am having frequent panic attacks, nausea, chest pain, nightmares, and overall rage, anger, fear, and depression over my past issues with my father.  Have confided in my mother who has also been subjected to violence from father but she tells me I am ""sensitive, over reacting, and too young to understand why my father did what he did."" This makes me even more upset because I feel like my feelings are being brushed away. I do love my father, he funds my education, and apart from his violent outbursts is the perfect dad. I feel guilty for holding a grudge against him. I feel it is my fault for being unable to move on. I feel it was a trivial matter but I am making a big deal out of it. But on the other hand am being severely affected to the point where I feel suicidal, am too depressed to get out of bed, cannot function. I am also starting to want to be beaten, and am wanting to harm myself because it has started feeling good. Am i overreacting? Am i creating this pain for myself? Want to forgive and forget, but am being held back. 

Any advice appreciated.

g944qz,Freedom Date,"May 20, 2015. The day I finally saw what was happening to me. 

May 20, 2015. The day I had enough. 

May 20, 2015. The day I realized all alcoholics don’t hit their partners. 

May 20, 2015. The day I realized abuse is a choice. 

May 20, 2015. The day I realized I can’t make him stop, with my words, my actions, or my obedience.

May 20, 2015. The day I realized the ball was in his court. 

May 20, 2015. The day I realized I would die if I stayed, either by his hand or my own. 

May 20, 2015. My 28th birthday.  

May 20, 2015. My freedom date. 

When I was living in abuse I constantly felt like I was the ball in an underwater pinball machine. Being bounced around between my abusers moods, while trying to hide what was happening. Always unable to breathe. Drowning. 

When in that space, moments of clarity when we are able to finally see the internal and external bruises and scars, are rare, and a gift. One of my moments occurred on May, 20 2015. My freedom date. My 28th birthday. 

Five days before my abuser escalated again when he hit me in front of our friends in a public place. On May 15, 2015 we went to celebrate a friend's birthday, and per usual, my abuser had too much to drink. The owners, good friends of ours, told me that I needed to get my husband home before they had to kick him out. I knew this wouldn’t go over well, but I also knew that I had to do something before anything worse happened. I thanked them for telling me and let them know I would take care of it. 

I went outside to where my husband was hanging out with our friends. I put on a smile, and tried to approach him with the *“everything is ok, you didn’t do anything wrong, it's just time to go”* vibe. I said, “hey baby, let's go home and see Quinn (our dog).” He said something sweet about Quinn and told me how much he loved me and our little family. I told him I was ready to go home and wanted him to come with me. He switched, said he wasn’t ready to leave, with his slurred speech and rocking body. He was wasted. I realized then that my approach was not working and I had to be more direct. I told him we had been asked to leave because he had had too much to drink and had made a scene. Next thing I knew, I felt his palm on my face, he slapped me hard. In public. In front of our friends. My first reaction was to defend him. I begged my guy friends not to react, and I walked away. A few guys took him aside and a few of my girlfriends came after me. I remember the embarrassment I felt. Gut wrenching, nauseating embarrassment. The cat was out of the bag. I couldn’t hide what was happening anymore. I had to face it. I saw the abuse through my friends eyes. They asked me what I wanted to do, how they could help. I told them I wanted to go home, and ride out the night until he passed out. He and I would talk about what happened in the morning after he sobered up. A few friends came home with us to ensure my safety. We proceeded through the night as if nothing had happened.

I woke up early the next day, sick to my stomach with embarrassment, shame, fear, and grief. All of those emotions piled into one moment make it hard to know what to do. What I wanted was not in my control. I wanted my husband to stop hitting me so I didn’t have to leave him. 

I got out of bed and went and laid on the couch. It was early and this was unlike me for a Saturday morning. He woke up and came into the living room and asked me what I was doing. Why was I sleeping on the couch? I calmly told him that it was because I was hurt by what he had done the night before. Per usual, he claimed he didn’t remember. I told him the story of what had happened. The cat was out of the bag. People now knew and saw with their own eyes, the dark side of our marriage. He was mortified. He cried. He begged me not to leave. He said it wouldn’t happen again. He swore he would find help. Start therapy. Quit drinking. And when I reminded him that he had said the same thing many times before, he said that this time it was different. He didn’t want to lose me. He couldn’t lose me. 

All I remember about that conversation was the heartache I felt. I no longer felt lost. I no longer felt shame, or fear. While we had had hundreds of conversations about this subject. He was different this time. Things had come to a head and we were at a fork in the road. I truly felt he was going to take this seriously now. I was still eager to see if he followed through, but I did have  a tinge of hope.  

We spent the day together, he let me cry when I needed to. If I felt we needed to talk more, he would listen and engage. He called all of our friends and apologized, thanked them for standing up for me and told them he was going to get help. We both knew we were facing an uphill battle to heal ourselves and our marriage. I was of course going to embark on this journey of repair with him. He was my husband, I loved him, and I promised to love him in sickness and in health, and he was sick. 

My birthday was on Wednesday that week, and my girlfriends and I made plans to go to a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu class on Tuesday night to kick off the birthday festivities. When I got home the house was empty, it was almost 9:00pm and that was very unusual for a work night. I called and texted my husband a few times with no luck. I was scared and I remember going back and forth between thinking “FUCK, here we go again,” and “don’t jump to conclusions, don’t assume the worst. He promised. It will be ok.” 

I don’t recall the details of what happened that night. I remember hearing the door open and being relieved, and then the fear when I realized he was drunk and on a tirade. I remember the fighting. The yelling. Me trying to leave. Him not letting me. I remember giving up and trying to go to sleep so that he might too. I remember him coming into the room and forcing me out of bed. I remember going outside to smoke a cigarette. I remember looking inside at him and seeing him yell at me through the glass. Then I remember the loud crash, glass flying in my face, and looking up to see his fist. 

This is how fucked up abuse is. I don’t know exactly when, but somewhere along the road of abuse I learned that keeping him happy and healthy, kept me happy, healthy and safe. When he punched me through the window I didn’t run. I didn’t leave. I immediately asked him if he was ok, sat him down on the couch, and while he cried, began taking the glass out of his hand and arm, and bandaged his wounds. 

After I “cared” for him, he calmed down and finally passed out. 

The next day, when I woke up on my birthday, I realized for the first time I wished I hadn’t. It was my birthday and I wanted to die. I had zero hope for my marriage. I had zero hope for the future. I had no idea what to do.

I wandered around the house, numb and anxious. 

I am not sure exactly what happened next, I just remember my moment of clarity. 

I realized….

Abuse is NOT a symptom of alcoholism. Abuse is a CHOICE. A choice that is made every time he hurts me with his words or hands, and it is a choice every time he doesn’t get help. 

He was escalating. Things were getting worse. It had only been FIVE days since the last act of violence. FIVE fucking days! I was in danger. 

It was MY BIRTHDAY! And the person that should be celebrating my life with me, was the one threatening it.

Reluctantly, I saw what William Earnest Henley wrote in his poem Invictus, “I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.” I didn’t like the options I had, but I did have options, and I had to get out.  

When he woke up, I told him I was leaving for work, and I wasn’t going to be home that night. I couldn’t do it anymore. He needed help and it was his shit to figure out. 

I asked him, for my birthday, to please not fight for me, or beg me to stay. 

For my birthday, please just let me leave. 

May 20, my birthday in more ways than one.

If you are caught outside after curfew you are taken to a quarantine facility for 2 weeks with no warning.

I couldn't get him off my hand and now it hurts like a bitch but he got what he wanted I unlocked the door and let him go. I then locked it behind him and called the police to make them aware he's outside and that he can be highly aggressive.

g99edt,Boyfriend screams - but says it’s my fault? (X-post),"My boyfriend has a terrible temper that ends with him screaming.

We had an incident when he raised a belt buckle as a joke to hit me. I yanked it out of his hands and hose finger was caught. He SCREAMED at the top of my lungs for me to get the eff away from him, that I needed to get the eff at out the apartment. He stormed out to grab food and I packed my things and left.

This is the second bad screaming incident that we have had, and in the earlier incident I also left the situation quietly and didn’t communicate for a few hours.

When we talked again, he said:
You left without a note. You should have waited for me to get back.
This is why our relationship can’t progress, because you threaten to leave me (only when he has a temper tantrum).
When I said get out I just meant go around the block.
If you felt scared you should just break up with me, then. You shouldn’t be in a relationship like that.

He made no effort to try and change his behaviour... He has temper tantrums, or tries to push my buttons by saying “you can’t be pregnant, you have to abort it. I would give you money to go away.” (He has Ed so we don’t use condoms)

“I’m moving to New York to concentrate on work. You can’t be jealous of me going out to make friends. I’m going to leave with a single girl friend or mine.”

“I’m not getting a dog friendly apartment (I have a small dog) so don’t even push that on me.”

He had an incident where he tried to take another girl home with him and texted her all night. We broke up, and since then he has repeatedly said “remember when you dumped me” and it’s constantly my fault.

Obviously he has a lot of other great traits. He is 10 years senior and quite wealthy. Am I being manipulated?

I responded very passionately, and in hind-site I definitely fucked up. I'm not a therapist. I needed to share this with someone. I hope that I didn't hurt this girl anymore than she already is.

g9kf04,Tonight has been the straw that broke the camel's back!,"As most of you know the story that has been going on with me and the current situation that I am living in: with my rather violent abusive controlling and psycho adoptive mother.

Tonight's incident was the straw that broke the camel's back literally.

What happened was she was going on about the $750 stimulus that most of us Australians get because of this COVID-19 situation. And then she started abusing the shit out of me for it.. I then looked her dead in the eyes and said something along the lines ""Don't be angry at me because you got nothing, be angry at the system that made up the rules on who gets it"".

Anyway it turned into an all-out fight (no physical contact), she started slamming cupboard doors and the like in order to try and intimidate or scare me as she's done in the past .. Then a bit more verbal abuse followed up after that with me retreating to the computer room to try and get away from her ..

To be honest I am literally shaking in anger, almost in tears to think this lady thinks she can be so abusive towards me and still expect for things to be done around the house, for things such as groceries and bills to be paid, my mentality is this, as you know: treat me like shit and you get nothing in return.

I have been holding back on this for quite some time, but I am strongly considering writing out an email to her, not being rude or abusive in it, but explaining my point of view, and then telling her a few home truths of my own, why was she not aggressive or abusive towards me for the first 5 years of my life whilst the adoption agency people came to check on me, why after 5 years did she then decide to start with what she did, when she could have been the better person and brought me up properly instead of what she did. 

I swear if she lays a hand on me one more time, I will leave, find legal representation and bring all that I have to bear against this woman, for I believe that she should be brought to justice like my biological mother was all those years ago ..",AuSSiETiG3R,2020-04-28 02:52:55,6,399,59.61,45.03,66.52,1,36.27,14.04,92.23,62.16,18.3,11.78,6.52,0.25,1,4.01,0,6.52,6.02,17.54,9.27,3.76,8.27,1.5,19.05,4.76,3.51,1.75,1.5,2.51,6.52,1.25,5.26,0.5,4.01,0.75,8.77,0.5,0.25,5.01,0,11.03,2.26,1.75,1.25,3.01,1.5,2.76,1.5,0.75,0.25,0.25,2.26,1,0.75,0,0.25,4.51,0.25,1,2.01,1.5,0,7.77,9.27,2.76,17.29,2.26,8.27,7.27,1.25,0,1,0.5,0,0.25,0.75,0.5,0,0,0,0.25,11.28,3.51,4.01,0.5,0,0,0.25,0.5,0.5,1.25,0.5,0.25
g9m7ig,How can I anonymously report domestic abuse? (UK),"My neighbours are constantly fighting. Every. Single. Day. They savagely scream at each other and attack each other. The woman is also emotionally abusive: she hides or throws away his healthy food and makes fun of his weight (which he is self conscious about) and actively tries to get him to hit her. Drugs are involved: I don't know if he takes drugs but I know that she often smokes weed and they've had arguments where she's angry because he won't go out and get her ""weed and pills."" What makes it worse is that they have two young children who are often at the receiving end of insane, screaming, aggressive rants. The problem I have is that I'm the only one who knows about it as they don't have neighbours on the other side so if I were to report my concerns they would definitely know if was me. They're insane and clearly very aggressive so if they find out that I've reported them it will absolutely ruin my life but I'm worried about the kids.

g9x89y,My mom and step brothers are experiencing domestic violence.,"My mom and step brothers are mentally/physically abused on a daily basis by her husband. He beats her, hits her with objects and shouts at his kids every time they see him (over anything. Literally, anything). I've convinced my mom to audio record these incidents and send them to me by email. She doesn't want to seek help. He has brainwashed her to believe that he is all powerful and can do whatever he wants to whoever he wants. He checks her phone on an almost daily basis. Restricts her communication to almost every part of her family. I have voice recordings from her of him shouting and cursing around and at the kids too. He calls her all the possible combinations of curse words. She has been to a lawyer and has been told that she will be safe, her kids will be safe and no harm will come to any of them if she decides to take action. But she's scared and doesn't want to do that. She's afraid of losing her kids because men in that country get custody of the children in almost any situation. She doesn't want to lose them and she's scared that she might. I'm afraid for her safety and for my step brothers futures. I love all of them to death and I can't take this anymore. I don't know what to do. Do any of you know what can be done in this situation?

In short:
Mother and 2 children are being physically and mentally abused by her husband. She's afraid to seek help because he's threatened her countless times and because she feels unsafe to do so. They live in a very Islamic country which favors it's citizens over everyone else. She has no citizenship and therefore no guarantee for anything.",throwawayacc552277,2020-04-28 15:32:25,6,311,19.88,94.94,1,1.84,13.52,16.72,93.89,60.45,23.79,17.68,3.54,0,0.32,11.9,1.93,6.11,2.25,13.83,12.54,2.57,7.4,2.57,18.33,3.54,0,1.61,0.32,2.89,6.11,1.61,4.5,1.93,0.96,0.64,23.47,3.22,0,9.65,5.47,12.54,1.93,1.93,1.93,3.86,2.25,1.29,2.57,0.32,1.61,0.32,1.61,0.32,0.96,0,0,8.68,3.22,0.96,3.22,0.96,2.25,1.29,16.08,2.25,9,1.93,4.82,2.25,0.32,0.64,0.64,0,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.83,7.07,0.96,0.32,0,0.32,0,0,0,4.18,0.64,0.32

ga11h1,I'm(23f) really positive my mom(56f) is being verbally abused by my father(70m) and I'm honestly not sure what to do or who to ask for advice.,"I love both of my parents. I always have. My father has always been more difficult to get along with so I'm closer to my mother but I still really love my father because he's always been a good father to me. 

My parents were together 6 years before they had me and they were never actually married but they've always lived together on my family's (mom's side) land. My entire life my mom has struggled with depression. I know because I've always seen it and she doesn't try to hide it other than never saying she's depressed but I was always the one she cried to for as long as I can remember. I've never actually thought my parents had a really happy relationship and I thought they would probably eventually separate but they never have. My parents work together, they are both scenic artists and have a name for their two man group and everything. When they don't work on movies they do work in people's houses. I've known my entire life my dad was hell to work with because that was what my mom usually cried to me about when I was a kid but apparently as he's gotten older he's gotten worse (I'm honestly not sure if I believe that though.) 

5 years ago my grandfather (mother's father) died from dementia. It was slow and we took care of him till the end feeding him, giving him his medicine, and changing his diapers. He couldn't be out in an assisted living facility because his dementia made him see everyone as monsters and think he was trapped so he would try to escape and fight back at people. It was really hard on my mom. That's when her depression started getting worse understandably. It's also when my father had a heart attack and had to get heart surgery. I believe that messed with him mentally as well but he doesn't talk about stuff like that so it's hard to know. It was a really stressful time. I didn't graduate highschool because of how many days I missed taking care of my grandfather and my mom blamed herself for that. My dad was disappointed and his usual judgmental self about it but he didn't really say much to me other than he won't take care of me. If he said anything else about me it wasn't to my face. The next year is also when I moved out because I genuinely wanted to have some space from my parents. I was battling my own demons from not graduating and a bunch of other things and I didn't feel like I should be there anymore. One day my mom was crying and hugged me and actually begged me not to leave her. I reassured her I was only going to be 20 min away and still going to be by almost every day and she got silent. I probably could have handled it better but I've never actually known how to comfort my mom other then say nice words and reassure her. After I left I guess their relationship took a turn for the worse slowly. Because her father died her depression was bad and she was loosing purpose and would sleep a lot. My dad got tired of it after a while and started calling her useless and telling her she doesn't do anything. Her whole life she's had a serious inferiority complex so I know that obviously did not help her. She went deeper into depression but still worked with my dad and what not on jobs. At some point she started having to ask my dad for money to pay the bills. Apparently up until then my mom had always payed the bills even if it meant taking all of her retirement and any money she was trying to save for me as well. My dad payed some I think or payed for something at least. But work has been slow these past 5 years so she's had to rely on him more. He wanted to stop working and ""retired"" but because they need money he still works with her. So with his retirement check supplementing them he's the main one paying for stuff now. It makes him really angry and he always fusses at her over money constantly. Last year I actually worked with them on a movie and I got to finally see first hand what my father was like to work with and it honestly made me hope my mother leaves him. I never in a million years thought I would think that but he was so rude and yelled constantly. He was so hard to work with even to other people (they just talked to my mom instead) and he would call my mother stupid all the time. He pointed some towards me but it was mostly just at my mom. After that I think it's just gotten worse and worse. My dad doesn't want to work anymore and hates that he has to to help support them. I can't imagine my father is happy either though so I honestly think both my parents are depressed and need help but neither trust therapists. 

My father's life consists of sitting at home with their dog smoking pot and watching TV. He's a Vietnam vet and has PTSD he's never been treated for so he smokes to help deal with it. You would think it would make him a bit happier and easier to be around but it doesn't for my mom atleast. She's depressed because he shows no love towards her at all anymore and tells her how she won't amount to anything and is useless and I think he's told her or implied to her that she's ugly and that's why he won't touch her. My dad probably has some sort of depression but he doesn't talk to anyone about his feeling so I wouldn't know for sure. They only have one car so he can't go anywhere unless my mom drives him. He gets upset when she's at my grandmaws house for too long (days) and accuses her of neglecting him. If my dad didn't live there though he would have nowhere to live. And for some reason even though my dad is so hard for everyone to work with he's the one people hire for work and my mom has trouble getting people to talk to her even though she's the boss and takes care of everything and is just as talented as him. So she probably feels like she couldn't survive without him and I'll be honest it would be really hard for her. The only thing my parents have ever done is art. And my dad would be homeless without my mom and her land. My mom's started breaking down though from the slightest things because she thinks she's a useless good for nothing. I don't know everything my father says to her because I don't live with them anymore but I atleast know the things I've said in this post. She's so depressed and stressed. I'm not sure what to do for her. I'm pregnant and was hoping that maybe they both might have some meaning brought back to their life from a grandchild but at the same time I won't let them make her stressed and depressed at a young age like I was. I want to help them both as much as I can but I have no idea how. I have a therapist I can possibly ask for advice but other than that that's it. My boyfriend's at a loss too because he's never really had experience with stuff like this until he met me but we both agree that something has to happen. I have 4 half siblings (all same dad) but they all have their own life and families and problems so I'm not sure how they could help. But I really want to help my mom. It's not healthy to feel like this I should know because I have before but we're very different in terms of what helps up cope and I'm also not even fully finished fighting my own demons so I don't have all the answers just yet. Any advice would greatly be appreciated and if anyone could tell me if this does indeed sound like verbal abuse that would be helpful too because I never know if I'm jumping to conclusions or not.",ThrowRApoiuy,2020-04-28 19:24:30,0,1445,5.52,44.5,41.14,19.57,20.64,13.63,96.54,63.46,23.46,17.92,9.13,0.21,0.07,6.78,1.73,5.54,2.49,12.11,11.83,8.03,11.07,3.53,20.35,4.36,3.11,1.31,0.97,2.56,6.51,3.04,3.46,0.35,0.97,1.45,17.44,4.08,0.07,4.78,5.4,18.41,2.7,2.01,2.56,3.32,2.91,6.37,1.8,0.35,0.62,0.76,1.94,0.35,1.18,0.07,0.21,7.27,2.35,1.52,1.59,1.45,0.97,5.95,12.94,0.9,10.8,1.18,4.08,5.81,1.94,0.42,0.28,0.76,0.21,0.14,0.35,0.07,0,0.14,0.14,0,11.49,4.84,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,5.05,1.25,0
ga1v4y,Tw- violence I (34f) was choked by my now ex flbf (30m) and I can't make sense of it,"I was in a fairly new relationship w my bf when COVID hit (2 months) and we decided to quarantine together. We had said I love you and both of us felt like this could be the major relationship of our lives.  There were glimpses of emotional and verbal abuse from him (he'd wildly curse at me or ice me out and refuse affection or accuse me of being manipulative or controlling whenever I expressed things I didn't like,) but I thought we were moving passed this. One week he sat there and berated everything about me and I packed his things for him to go, but he ended up wanting to stay.  We talked to a therapist remotely.  We decided to take space while in the apartment bc of COVID and we had a great week where he gave me the affection I needed and I gave him the freedom to do his thing w video games. Then it exploded. 

It started w him getting super angry and volatile over misusing the washing machine. I was on a work call, so I muted it and went to tell him he had put the machine on the wrong setting. He immediately got very nasty and defensive but I needed to finish my call so I left the room. After the call ended I went back to him where he proceeded to tell me to ""get the fuck"" out of his face and when I told him not to curse at me he kept yelling ""or what?!"" at me, standing up to like square up to me.  My only response was, you shouldn't talk to me like that because you should have respect for me and he told me he clearly doesn't. So I ended up sitting down on the floor, shaking, and he left the room. We did not speak for a full 24 hours. 

I went out the next morning and got a long  text where he explained he felt stupid by me explaining the washing machine and that he's sure now that he's a self sabateur and he thought our relationship could truly work out and he loved me and he was sorry.  Noticing that he never acknowledged the cursing in my face, I wrote back a long thread about how I found the cursing and escalation to be unacceptable and disrespectful and I didn't want it. This did not go over well. He ended up texting me he was going to leave.  I told him, if he could not act with that basic level of respect he should go, because it's a deal breaker. I arrived home around this time, went upstairs and asked him why he was upset.

Tw-Violence
He jumped up, grabbed me by the throat and threw me against my tall dresser and started kicking me. When I finally got free, I went for my phone which was still connected to a work conference call that he took from me, taunting me about calling the police. He then put me in a headlock and bodyslammed me to the floor on top of one of his computer monitors. I was shrieking bloody murder at this point, hoping one of my neighbors would call the police. When he finally let me go I grabbed my phone and texted my father, my 2 friends and a friend of his who lived around the block hoping one of them would call the police. I sat on the edge of the bed across the room to make sure he didn't steal anything from me.  The bf of his friend I texted called and my bf lied saying I wouldn't let him leave and that I was hitting him, to which I responded get the fuck out.  He ended up leaving, his friend ended up coming by and asking what happened, I told him, he helped my ex get his things and that was that. My dad arrived soon after to comfort me.

My issue now is that I cannot make sense of this. I don't get this. I don't get how someone attempts to strangle their partner not even an hour after they're telling them how much they love them. I met w my therapist the next day. I am still in shock. My heart hurts; this is not the first time I've dealt w partner violence and I already have PTSD from it, which my bf (now ex) knew about.  I can't wrap my head around loving someone and wanting to harm them. I can't understand the escalation. And the choking part makes me believe that this probably wasn't the first time he's been violent, because that's a step away from killing your partner.  Help me heal. 

Tl;dr my partner choked me out of nowhere and i cant make sense of it to heal.

ga3y23,I wish there was a code word that law enforcement was trained to hear from domestic violence victims.,"There would be a need for awareness from domestic violence support groups or women’s shelters or counselors, some one some way. But first it needs to be established and then taught to law enforcement or other mandated like reporters for when the abuser is around. 

I couldn’t call the cops myself, but I was able to contact the interpersonal violence risk manager from my university and she called the cops for me. She encouraged me to tell the cop the truth of what was going on. I was scared for my life. I wanted the cop to come but I was scared how he would react to that. When he found out that law enforcement was coming, he lost it. It’s hard to describe, but he was no longer him. I couldn’t talk him down. My natural instinct was to diffuse the situation. To make him feel better as I have been trained all these years to do. But this time was different and it terrified me. When the cop came, he talked to him first. He resumed to his natural charismatic state and was able to be calm enough to down play what was happening. The cop bought it. I was too scared to tell him that I was scared. I was scared what he would do to me or our kids once this was all over. I wouldn’t be protected forever. So I said nothing that would be protect me then. I didn’t want to be the bad guy. 

Looking back, I wish there was a code word that I could have used that the cop would have known that I was too afraid to speak. That would have taken some of the blame off of me. 

But it didn’t happen that way. 

It just built his confidence up. He gotten away with how he treated me, so he treated me worse. He’d rape me. And when I would talk to him about it later he said the way I said no was too cutesy to mean no. 

I couldn’t take it anymore. My therapist helped me come up with a plan and stick to it. So I packed what I could in the car and withdrew my kids out of school just to get away from him. 

I suffered severe depression, anxiety and ptsd from the years of his abuse. It was scary how bad my mental health got after I left. 

I’m better now, but I wished so badly someone would have saved me.",watchin_workaholics,2020-04-28 22:58:57,6,436,19.43,32.33,12.92,1,12.82,12.16,93.81,62.61,22.94,15.83,10.09,0.23,0,5.5,0,7.11,4.59,12.84,12.39,5.28,7.57,2.29,22.25,5.05,2.06,2.52,0.92,1.38,7.8,1.83,5.96,2.29,0.92,0.69,11.01,0,0.46,0.69,5.28,13.07,1.15,1.38,4.82,1.83,1.38,3.44,1.83,0.23,1.15,0.46,0.92,0,0.69,0.23,0,9.4,0.69,2.06,4.36,1.83,1.38,9.86,8.49,1.61,9.86,1.38,4.36,4.36,2.29,0.23,0.46,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.16,7.8,2.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.29,0,0

ga52yk,I'm told it's abuse but I'm not sure,"I don't even know how to put this into words. It's long.  
I am a 32f who married a foreigner 9 years ago and live in his country of nationality. Last May the relationship came to an end with him alleging domestic abuse, saying that I assaulted him one night when I was very depressed and drunk, having me arrested, pursued an assault charge against me, said I threatened to kill my children, used this to have me kicked out of my home and the lives of my 2 young children. I had nowhere to go and moved to a different city where my mother had a friend with a spare room.   
In the meanwhile, my ex-husband didn't let me see my children then enforced rules on how I can see them and I took the matter to court. Social services became involved and he told them all sorts of lies about me saying that I withheld food from my eldest child to punish her, or threw her dinner away then gave her unhealthy food to eat, neglected her and made her look after her younger brother etc.  He also told me to leave the country and leave my children.   


The way he was so vindictively doing things made me suspect something. 2 weeks before the incident where he says I assaulted him, I was very depressed and suicidal. I told him I want to die and asked him for his prescription medication to overdose on. He gave them to me and left me to it. I took the pills and told him I was going to sit in the car to die. He just let me. When I woke the next morning, scared after realising I hadn't died, I went back to the house and asked him to call and ambulance. He hesitated. He did call for one in the end but didn't bother to come to the hospital to see me until many hours later. I have had depression since I was a teenager.   


I started suspecting that I had been a victim of domestic abuse for years. I called a helpline and told them my story. I was told that I have highlighted coercive control, gaslighting and one incident of rape. I then had to begin the painful process of believing that I had been abused and that my ex-husband seems to have set a trap for me to get me out of his life and that I stupidly fell into that trap. He had previously threatened to revoke my visa and have me leave the country without my children. In the months before the incident, when I expressed to him that I don't think our marriage is working, he told me once again that I could leave the country.  Seems like he's made good on his threats as I am fighting to remain in the country now. He even filed for a  divorce on my birthday. I went to the police to report the domestic abuse but I had terrible anxiety after that and had to retract my report for the sake of my mental health.  


He actively pursued assault charges against me and I tried to fight them. But I had no defence as I was intoxicated. The law frowns upon that. It didn't matter what he did before, all that mattered was that one incident. He also asked for a restraining order if I get convicted. I did get convicted, and he was granted a restraining order aginst me. He won't speak to me about our children, he won't involve me in decisions about them. Luckily I had the support of a DV organisation who helped me source a family lawyer and immigration lawyer. 

Needless to say, this has hit my mental health hard. It's been a struggle to accept that I gave many years of my life and sacrificed a lot only to have it all taken from me overnight. I've lost my children.   


This brings me to my current situation. I am living with a much older man. It started innocently enough with him letting me lodge in his spare room and providing me with emotional and mental support. As I could not pay any rent, I offered to cook and clean in return. The relationship became sexual and feelings became involved. But he would never 'put a status on it'. I have been referred to as his friend, lodger, flatmate, girlfriend. He said he doesn't like to label relationships, despite having had numerous girlfriends in the past. He is physically gentle and never aggressive. Verbally though, he has put me down about my choice of clothes (uncool), told me that anger is not a natural emotion that I am entitled to feel, that my being sad affects him because I'm sharing the space with him and my gloominess brings him down, that it is selfish of me to be angry or sad around him. He has told me that if I'm going to be gloomy then go do it in my own space. I thought I could go do it in my room, but even then the room is used as his office and exercise room too. So I don't actually have my own space.   


On Sundays I tend to be upset all day because I speak to my children on the computer in the morning and it hurts me when my children are allowed to be distracted during the call and I have to stare at an empty screen sometimes. Last Sunday after the call, I asked my flatmate if he'd like to go for a walk later. He said maybe. I went to my room, shut the blinds and door and lay in bed for a while. He asked if I was unwell or down. I told him I was down. He asked about the walk and I said no initially then thought it would be better for me to get out so we did go for a walk. It was uncomfortable. Later that day he said something about that, that I went to the room and was laying in the dark and it would be better if I didn't feel down at all. That by now I should have built a mechanism to shield myself from being upset by the calls with my children.  
A few days before that he was behaving unempathetically while we were out. Throwing food for birds near us even though I had just said that I'm scared of birds. Asking me if I was going to take a homelss guy home when I saw one and commented on the poor man. And when I told him that I find myself wanting some of my belongings from my ex-husband that I've had since I was a child or teenager, he told me those are just things. I said that those things are mine and have memories for me. He argued that the memories are in my mind and that should be enough and that things like books can be replaced. He said that objects are just objects, yet when I asked him how he would feel if I were to get rid of some of his seemingly unimportant objects (and there are lots) he said that would be unacceptable as that would be me taking control of his posessions. He also reinterated his possession of the space that I am living in by asking me, where am I going to put those things if I manage to get them from my ex.  


He treats me with disrespect a lot of the time. Like I'm his servant. He barely responds when I say something that he doesn't find interesting because he says why should he pretend to be interested? He is dismissive of me when I talk to him while he's doing something, yet he constantly talks to me when I am watching videos or trying to read. Yet he looks after me too. When I am too fatigued or upset to buy food and cook, he does it. He has taken me to the doctor when I have been very depressed.  


I spoke to my DV support worker. I told her it feels unhealthy for me to have to suppress my feelings and be told they are inappropriate. I told her I feel like I don't have my space. I asked her if it's abusive and she said yes. It is controlling and manipulative. That he gets a lot out of me being here: companionship, housework and cooking, sex....  
I told her that it feels wrong to say that someone who put a roof over my head and fed me when I couldn't afford anything for myself is abusing me. She said that gratitude does not excuse controlling behavior and that the power dynamics in this relationship have been skewed from the beginning making it easy for me to be abused. She told me she can help me get out of here and into a refuge or a room somewhere if I am homeless due to domestic abuse. 

This feels so wrong. Months ago I had to accept that I had been in an abusive marriage. Now I have to question if I am in an unhealthy and abusive situation that I should get out of. Yet I am scared. I have never lived alone before. I have no family nearby.",shethinksnot,2020-04-29 00:37:14,8,1578,25.22,42.94,63.89,1.8,17.15,14.2,94.04,62.55,24.4,18.69,12.17,0.32,0,5.7,0.51,5.64,5.07,13.37,10.46,4.56,7.67,1.65,21.04,3.55,1.84,1.52,0.57,1.01,5.45,1.2,4.12,0.82,1.9,0.95,14.26,0.7,0.38,0.95,5.26,9.25,2.22,1.46,1.71,2.79,0.63,2.53,2.98,0.89,1.33,0.76,2.53,0.13,1.46,0.19,0.82,6.78,1.71,0.51,3.49,1.14,0.44,8.11,9.95,0.82,13.62,2.22,5.26,6.08,1.08,0.63,1.33,0.32,0.06,0.32,0.32,0,0,0.06,0,0,10.9,5.89,2.41,0.06,0,0.06,0,0.19,0,2.03,0.25,0
ga5cns,Ex called me emotionally abusive when I brought up his physical abuse,"My ex-husband and I were talking tonight and I reminded him about all the ways he physically abused me. It was late and I had it on my chest. I wanted to see some remorse on his part but of course, none of that happened. 

I mentioned the things that I still felt heartbroken about, which he said the normal “I feel bad for making you go through these” (he doesn’t feel bad) and “I’m sorry” and all. 

Later, I mentioned a video I found from long ago. I had recorded him when we were fighting. I told him  “you blamed the fact that you were abusing me on [things that happened in the last months of our marriage] but the video is proof that you were abusing me before those things happened too” and then I mentioned that in the video, it turns out he was beating me to a pulp because I had called him “useless” the night before for not cleaning a single counter that I had been asking him to clean for two weeks. 

That’s when ex-hubby dearest got mad and mentioned a very minor thing that happened between us years prior to that video, when we were just married. He said he was beating me the whole time because of that. I called him out about how minor that thing was and told him he basically always inflated minor events into huge dramas so he could have excuses to beat me. When I said this, he started crying and calling me names, and saying to him it was a huge deal, and I never wanted to talk about how I had been “emotionally abusive” with him for years and how I refused to carry any of the blame.

So we went from talking about the trauma of his physical violence on me, to him yelling at me and crying that I was “emotionally abusive” and posturing dangerously in less than 20 minutes.",myaccountiscool,2020-04-29 01:01:49,0,341,21.57,80.23,31.94,1,26.23,15.25,95.89,61.58,26.69,19.06,9.97,1.47,1.17,6.45,0,7.62,4.69,12.9,7.04,6.16,8.5,1.17,17.3,3.52,1.47,2.64,0.88,2.64,6.74,0,6.74,0,3.52,1.76,18.18,1.17,0,0,7.04,7.33,1.17,1.76,0.88,0.59,1.76,1.17,3.81,1.47,1.47,0.88,1.17,0.29,0.88,0,0,7.04,2.64,0.29,3.23,0.29,0.88,11.73,3.52,0.59,13.2,1.47,4.4,7.33,0.29,1.47,0,0,0,0,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,12.32,3.52,2.64,0,0,0,0,0.59,3.52,0.88,0.59,0.59
ga6lfk,[28M] my girlfriend [25F] and I both have terrible tempers and I don't know if we should stay together.,"I have also posted in r/relationship_advice but did not get many responses. thank you

We have been together about 4 years but known each other since our first year of college. I had a terrible temper in my youth but through therapy and meditation I have honed it down to a point where I don't think I have actually lost my temper since I was about 21. My girlfriend on the other hand still has an awful temper. 90% of the time she is lovely to be around but sometime little things will trigger her and the situation will get heated from there. Usually it is just shouting although she does slap and hit me sometimes. I know this is extremely unhealthy but I am much bigger than her so its not really an issue (I've never felt in danger). Because of how awful I was in my teenage years whenever we argue I try to focus on something else and not give her any reaction, I will usually take some time for myself to meditate and reflect if we have a big falling out too. My lack or reaction seems to provoke her sometimes and I think that being in quarantine has made tempers thin as we have been arguing more recently.

The thing is after an argument she will always come and find me and try to comfort me, tell me she is sorry and regrets it and to be honest I believe her. We never argue about the same thing twice and recently she has been taking some of my tips and trying to be less aggressive and reflect on arguments more.

unfortunately we had a particularly bad falling out a few days ago and I am not sure how to proceed from here. I believe it started with her bringing up that I never help her with house work which is true, I don't. We've had a system pretty much since we started living together where household cleaning is her job and cooking/food related stuff is mine this first came about since she is a terrible chef but I am very interested in cooking so we got better food when I was preparing. I made some comments about how if she was actually motivated to improve herself and learn to cook then we could switch things up but I was not going to be happy eating takeaway food every night when I could just cook us something. plus takeaway is super expensive. This escalated with some more back and forth and she hit me. Slap to the face and it was hard (I'm still bruised) which shocked me quite a bit as she has never put that much power into a slap before. I don't really remember what happened next but after talking to her afterwards I think I must have made a backhanded comment about the slap and then she punched me and that one hurt a lot. she then picked up a knife at which point I grabbed her and took it from her. I said to her that if she ever hit me again I would kill her.

I didn't mean it. At least I certainly don't think I did, but in the moment I just forgot all my years of surpressing my temper as I was furious. I didn't hurt her, aside from squeezing her hand to get the knife off her and I didn't threaten her with the knife. But I do worry now that these ever more common arguments are leading me back to the person I was as a young man, a person who I most definitely don't want to be. I went to meditate after this and try to calm down but I'm not sure what to do going forwards.

Tl;Dr I had a bad temper as a young man and she has one now and I worry that together I am becoming more like I was when i was younger.",throwra_obvs,2020-04-29 02:53:22,0,686,13.42,30.49,84.02,2.53,24.5,14.14,95.34,62.68,21.72,16.62,10.06,1.9,0.15,4.52,0,5.1,4.37,11.66,11.52,7,9.48,2.77,20.26,6.56,3.64,2.19,1.17,3.5,7.29,2.33,4.96,0.44,2.48,0.73,10.64,0,0.29,4.52,0.29,16.91,2.92,2.77,1.75,3.79,2.48,4.96,1.46,0,0.29,1.17,2.19,0.44,0.58,0,1.17,8.31,3.06,1.9,1.9,1.31,0.73,6.12,11.08,1.6,15.31,1.75,5.69,8.45,0.87,1.02,0.29,0.15,0.44,0.15,0.15,0,0.15,0,0,0,8.75,4.08,0.87,0,0.15,0,0,0,0,1.9,0.58,1.17

gabfun,Emotional and physical abuse,"I need a little advice. I live with my grandma and little brother, my grans now 70 years old and is still working and struggling I do my share and put in money when we need it. About 4/5 years ago we kicked my older sister out the house because she was abusing my gran and little brother, I would get in between and hold my sister down so my gran/brother doesnt get hurt, My little brother has disabilities and is ADHD, during the time that my sister was gone she had stayed with her bf who lived with his parent at the age 47 (I know right) his parents then had to move houses just to get rid of them, so now they staying here. they have a baby boy now and use him as leverage, they make us feel guilty for wanting to get rid of them because of the emotional and physical abuse we receive from them. We have tried to kick them out many times but they continue to refuse, they've been staying with us for about 6 months now but haven't even put in a single cent in to help out, they eat all our food and take whatever they can for granted. Everyday there is an argument or a fist fight. I'm tired of this lifestyle and so is my gran and little brother. 
We have called the cops but they just come talk to her and go, she even shuts them down. Just yesterday I got a black eye because my sister was unhappy. When we eat at home we don't eat a lot but my sister still has the nerve to complain, we don't have a lot but she still takes from us because she's not happy till she gets the better half of things. Life's really hard and she makes things worse for all of us, we don't wanna call child line because they could just take my nephew away. We get threats from her saying she's going to get people to come attack us if we out on the street like for e.g.. walking to the shop's. In all honesty I'm tired of this and will do anything to get them out of our life for good. What can I do?

gac0h3,Truly Free.,"Hi guys, I've never posted here before but after finding this, I really felt the need to! I don't really know the purpose of this post, I guess I want to finally get so much off my chest, maybe ask a few questions to people who have always made it out, etc. 

I don't want this to be super long but for context, I'll describe a little about what happened to me.
I was 19 when I met him, he was 20. We met online and I was definitely naive when it came to dating.
We lived a pretty big distance away but the way he spoke immediately caught my attention, I was absolutely obsessed. While I had dated a little before, I'd never felt so drawn to someone, I now realise that like a lot of things, that intensity he made me feel wasn't typical or particularly healthy.

He told me that he loved me after the first week, which seems shocking to type but at the time, I took it as a huge compliment. 

Skip ahead 4 months and he asked me to move in with him, very sudden. Already, there had been red flags, which I found myself ignoring or making excuses for. He would lose his shit if I didn't answer the phone to him whilst I was at work, that kind of thing. The first time he made me cry was before this point, actually. I had stayed over his for the weekend and we had missed the alarm to wake up and when he finally did wake, he started screaming at me, calling me a ""stupid bitch"". I was scared and in shock, I'd never seen this side. The dead, shark eyes that glared at me, which I'd see more and more frequently throughout the relationship. I don't know why but even that early on, I told myself it was out of character and just let it slide. I think, to be quite honest, a lot of my reaction to his abuse came from having an emotionally abusive step father growing up.
I felt pressured to move to his city, a place where I knew nobody. His justification was that it was super cheap and he already had his own home, whereas I still lived with parents. The way he spoke about it made it seem like a fairytale and I just couldn't wait, so I gave up my job, friends and everything I knew.

I moved in the November and things seemed somewhat smooth. Little things bothered me, such as feeling very responsible for all the housework and such. I had little questions in the back of my mind, he would tell me he'd been part of the army which made no sense whatsoever (and I feel embarrassed to admit that I took his word for it at first) and how he had managed to get a beautiful home so young, etc.

Then a week before Christmas day, I found out he'd been cheating from the moment we started dating. As in, he was literally arranging to have sex with women the moment I left our first date. I was broken in a way I'd never felt before and the pain kept coming. It was constant. I am not exaggerating when I say that every day, I found new messages to women. He had multiple dating site accounts, Facebooks, things like that. I lost my damn mind, I felt like a crazy person, I would incessantly check his social media and the anxiety never stopped because I was always finding more and more things, I couldn't sleep, rarely ate, it got so awful that I lost my job because instead of working, I would stay at the home to try and ""prevent"" him cheating.

I guess my first question is here, I feel still so traumatised from the cheating, will I always feel this way? I do engage in mental health services, btw. At the moment, I am so scared to date again, I don't want to push my insecurities and trauma onto another man because of what I've been through.

This is where the gaslighting and emotional abuse got worse, it went from fake crying to ""it's your fault for X reason"", I genuinely felt suicidal. 
After a period of calling him out for what he was doing, the physical abuse started. I remember sitting in the bedroom and he slapped me so hard, I sat back on the bed in awe. I felt nothing, almost. Not fear, not anger, just empty. I couldn't speak. I always thought I'd be the type to fight back or get out straight away but I didn't. I loved him and partly, it was pride, I'd ignored my family and friends to move in with him and I didn't want to admit that things had become to horrid. 

He proposed not long after. I hate that I still feel so much shame typing all this out, I feel so stupid, I accepted his proposal. 

From here, the physical abuse increased. Over the 4 years, I was slapped, punched, strangled, hit with glass, so many things. 
To be honest, I still feel disassociated from these events. I remember the actions but there's almost no emotion attached, sometimes I have panic attacks but that's rare. Mostly, it's just a numbness, is this typical? 

During my time with him, I discovered his family were just as toxic. They knew of his abuse (and later, I found out they knew of his abuse towards others), and would frequently tell me to call them if he beat me, not the police. 
He had worked very hard to separate me from my family and friends, so really, the only people I had around me were he and his family. This really warped my sense of reality. I stopped having my own thoughts, I believed whatever they said and I constantly questioned my own sanity. 
Having now left, I find there are people who struggle to believe my story because they cannot wrap their heads around how my ex wasn't the only abuser, it was his family too, has anyone else had this experience? 
I find it difficult to process the whole reality of it myself, how it is possible that the whole family were just as evil as eachother? 

The emotional abuse was so awful. I can't truly describe it, I lost myself completely. I rarely went outside, my anxiety was constant, I couldn't sleep, and the more my mental health declined, the more he would display it to people, ""you see how unwell she is, I'm trying to support her"", making himself seem like the wonderful, supportive partner and not the cause. 
His family would constantly make comments that they didn't know what was wrong with me, that I was selfish for being so damaged, and one even accused me of having the devil inside of me. 
I felt so, so alone. I was utterly convinced that there was no point leaving, nobody would believe me, that I was the ""crazy girl"". 

One of my motivators for leaving was having a child with him. A decision I regret but I love my child dearly, I just wish it had been with a good man. 
Shortly after our child was born, I was diagnosed with PPD, and had to endure many threats towards my child's safety. 
My ex's family tried to tell people that I was a ""cold, uncaring"" mother because I struggled to connect with my child, the violence and abuse I was going through made me feel disconnected with everything around me. 
Social services became involved and to my horror, this is how I learned my ex was a sex offender. Everyone knew but me. 

How can I even learn to trust again when such huge things were hid from me so easily with my ex? Am I an idiot? I really just don't know, my trust in people as a whole is so broken. 

Over the years, I had wanted to escape. The trauma bond was so strong, I was convinced this man was my soulmate, despite everything. In a way, I think it was easier to believe that I was the one in the wrong than admit that I'd wasted years with a monster. I blamed myself for so much of what was happening. 
After the birth of my child, the information I had found out, I started to seek support. 
I know how this sounds, that I should have left the moment my child was born but it was so hard. I was terrified. 

In June 2019, I sat in bed writing my ex another letter of how he could change for the better and I stopped. It hit me so hard that he didn't care. How many notes had I written over the years? I stayed up all the night as he slept, got dressed in the morning and told him I was meeting a friend for a coffee.
He was fine with it. He never stopped me from socialising as such, as he knew it would arouse suspicion, he just made me feel so awful about myself that I had developed massive social anxiety and felt unable to leave (and frequent beatings when returning from the rare trips out).
I went to the police station and broke down. I kept apologising to the officers. They interviewed me, video interviewed me, and arrested him.

One of my worries is that I didn't explain everything in the police interview? Some parts I left out because I was so panicked that I wasn't thinking clearly, I wanted it to be as comprehensive as possible but I couldn't recall so much in the state I was in. Will that work against me in court? I really have never been through something like this before.

My child was thankfully being looked after by a member of my family when these events were taking place.
I was in the police station for hours, he was held overnight. I went back to the home we shared alone. At first, I felt a rush of relief but that quickly turned into panic, I was distraught. Would he kill me for turning him in? What was going to happen to me? I am so ashamed to admit this but at 3-4am, I frantically telephoned every police contact I'd been given, leaving messages to ""please let X come home, I can't do this.""
I did speak with an officer the day after who explained my reaction was quite common but I still worry that it made me look like a liar? Because I'd reported him for such vile crimes and I begged for him to be allowed home.

The next day, his family visited me. They were encouraging me and my child to stay in the city, away from my family, in a women's hostel (in a part of the city I'd never visited). While explaining what had happened, his mother casually interrupted and asked if I had a hair brush she could use. Such a small, stupid thing but it woke me up, in a way, to see that she didn't care one bit. She wasn't even listening. Her only contribution was to add that my ex, her son, should kill himself. 
The moment she left, I called my family and started packing, within the hour I was back in my hometown with my child.

The reactions to me coming home have been mixed and I find it so difficult to deal with. I have been told by family, ""if it was as bad as you say, you would have left sooner."" Some family members treat me like I'm an alien, tiptoeing around me, not knowing how to speak to me. It makes me feel like there's something wrong with me.
Thankfully, many people have been so wonderful and supportive.

My ex has not contacted me since, though he did access my emails while there was a temporary restraining order in place, which I did inform the police but nothing happened.
Sometimes I question my sanity because I read so, so many stories about how the abusive ex stalks and never forgets about the victim but in my case, this hasn't happened. Don't get me wrong, I am beyond thankful but it makes me question myself- how could he have been so abusive if he's just allowing me to get on with my life? That's not what abusers do, is it? Does that make any sense?

My life has changed dramatically. I have a stable job, my own home, and a beautiful social life. I thought I would never cope without him. I thought I'd be a shell and my mother commented on how when she saw me for the first time again, I looked devoid of life, barely spoke or moved, wouldn't make eye contact.
I am so blessed for how things are. I never thought I'd feel the way I do now, I've become so loud and I'm proud to be who I am. 

However, I am left with so many questions and confusion.
I want to move on from what happened but I'm scared to forget what happened. I don't know why. I want to remember, almost like if I can remember, I have better chance of getting into that situation with someone else, you know?
I feel so alone, I truly cannot see myself dating again. I don't know how, I feel like if I open up about what I've been through, men will be horrified and want nothing to do with me.
I don't know when the nightmares will stop, I get triggered by the smallest of things sometimes.
How do I explain to my child?
And the one I am most disgusted to admit, why do I still feel love for this man? Attraction? I still have horrible times where I think, ""well, if it wasn't for him abusing me, he was great"" which is so fucking stupid, I don't know how I can think something so awful.

gaheen,I'm so lost... I need help,Okay so I'm going to try to make this make as much sense as possible. About two years ago I left my kid's dad he was abusive towards me not them. I took my kids and I left and we stayed in a homeless shelter for about six months until through a program in the homeless shelter I got into a place that was a year-and-a-half ago. Since then I met somebody else and just my luck he's abusive to. Not so much physically but mentally and emotionally and like threatening suicide and threatening me lose my kids. And then on top of that I was hoping to use stimulus check to get away so I decided to use some self income as a way to file my taxes cuz I thought only tax filers were going to get it and I guess I did something wrong I don't know because it says still processing on my tax return which means I'm not eligible for the stimulus because I don't know I have to wait for a letter from the IRS I try to call and there's no live person you can talk to. And on top of that I have nobody to talk to no family no friends. I just wish I can get on the phone with somebody from the IRS to see what I need to do to fix my return so I can get my money and get away. I have a 8 year old boy 7 year old girl 5 year old boy in 3 year old girl and I do not want my girls to grow up thinking it's okay for a man to treat them the way that they've seen me be treated and I don't want my boys to grow up thinking it's okay to treat a woman like that or anybody.

gai4hv,Only my nightmare,"For years he had abused me. I didn’t really see it as that, but perhaps ‘that’ was what it was? 
He was arrested in 2018. He pulled a knife out on me, following months of physical assaults. Even that wasn’t enough. He was arrested after he attacked me one night and my daughter rang the police. I understood what he did was not right and, went along with the prosecution until social services got involved and said they were placing my children under a Section and could take my children away for not safeguarding them!! I dropped all charges, I didn’t want SS in our lives. 
Seven months from his arrest, restraining order lifted he got in touch. Obviously he was sorry.. had changed... all of the expected! Stupidly, I fell for it. Convinced all those closest to us to give him another chance... he had changed... fat chance of that. 
Reality was, he found better ways to disguise it. Began slow and soon built up. I thought I hid it well. Until this week, in the middle of lockdown. He stood in the street and threatened to stab me, in front of all our neighbours and friends.. and then, threatened to stab and kill them. So drunk he probably couldn’t remember his name. He then, jumped in his vehicle and drove off. Was soon caught, crashed into a wall and refused to give a breath test. Obviously he was arrested and threw into a cell. Police involved, I haven’t pressed charges. But it seems I didn’t need too. One neighbour has reported hearing my cries as he called me a slag and hit me, the other neighbour reported witnessing his behaviour towards me, all heard him say he will kill me and, the worst, I mean the very worst is my teenage daughter reported witnessing him beat me and push me down the stairs. 
I didn’t know she saw it. 
I can’t even begin to describe my guilt.

gak3tp,Referred here from r/relationships,"I was referred here from a post I made in r/relationships. 

 Long story short, my (F21) now ex (M23) would call me names a lot (stupid bitch, loser, pathetic, piece of shit, etc). I still hangout with him because I can’t seem to separate myself from him. 
 
There was a time when I accidentally touched him with a toy while getting intimate in a pitch black room and he got extremely upset, called me a dumb bitch, took the toy and hit me hard in my face with it. 
After that I laid in bed next to him and cried because it really hurt. He was playing a video game. I turned to him and said that he didn’t have to hit me so hard/in my face. He replied with telling me to shut the fuck up or he was leaving. I started speaking again and he got up to leave. I was extremely manic &amp; really couldn’t handle being alone even though he was the one who made it worse. I wanted him to stay with me. I bear hugged him and kept pleading with him not to leave over an accident. He kept grabbing me hard and pushing me onto my bed. At that point he got my afghan and pushed it into my face covering my mouth and nose. He grabbed my throat at the same time. 
He left a horrible bruise on me. The next day I showed him the bruise and said it was REALLY unnecessary. He told me it was my fault and I hurt myself. 

I might sound dumb for asking this, but do you think that could have been a one time thing? He’s usually very sweet and loving.

gawomh,Concerned friend..... What can I do?,"Hoping someone can help shed some light on my current situation. 

My best friend (20yr old) recently moved in with her abusive boyfriend, they fought constantly before they moved in and he would break multiple things and threaten to kill himself or crash their car.  As of recent, she didn't express concern of the relationship (although I knew she was in denial). Tonight She called me crying and barely being able to form a sentence she asked if she could come over and ofc I welcomed her to stay the night. Almost an hour had passed as I was calling her phone was unavailable. My mind was racing I knew something wasn't right I hopped in the car to drive to her place I was starting to worry that things had got out of hand. I received messages from her boyfriend's friend account that she had managed to get a hold of. She told me she hid in the bathroom and was throwing up. Concerned I waited I wasn't leaving without her or to see her, She asked me to pick up her broken phone which he had thrown off their balcony. He had multiple friends over and they just blindly ignored the violent situation that unfolded in the apartment. Once she found a way out we talked in my car she broke down and told me he has threatened to stab her and her family if she left or broke up with him. We sat and talked for 2 hours I begged for her to come home with me but she wouldn't she was more scared of him hurting her family than her.  He also consumed a Xanax and smoked some weed (which is a regular occurrence)  and was out of it when she returned back to the room. He degraded her and forced her sexually. She told me wants to leave but is scared and confused I've been researching services and hotlines to help her get the help she needs but it still feels a bit helpless. 

&amp;#x200B;

Was it wrong of me to leave her... Is there something else I should be doing to ensure her safety she also refuses to talk to her mother about this. I'm hoping someone with some first-hand experiences can shed some light and direction in the right steps.",pamelaa34,2020-04-30 07:29:13,3,395,37.08,86.19,8.23,1,19.75,15.19,93.67,59.24,23.8,19.75,6.33,0.51,0,11.65,1.27,4.05,4.05,14.43,8.86,2.78,7.34,1.27,18.73,3.54,2.03,1.01,0.76,2.03,6.58,1.27,4.81,1.52,1.52,1.27,21.77,0.76,1.52,9.62,2.78,10.13,1.01,0.51,2.53,4.56,0,3.8,2.78,1.01,0.51,1.01,1.77,0.51,0.51,0.25,0.51,10.13,4.05,0.76,4.56,1.01,1.52,10.89,6.58,1.01,15.7,4.05,7.09,5.06,0.76,1.01,1.77,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.9,6.33,0.76,0,0.51,0.25,0,0.25,0,1.77,1.52,0.51

gazudh,Girl I’m “talking” to has a TPO out on her ex and he messaged me.,"So I have been talking to a girl fairly frequently the last 3 weeks. 
The first week that her and I were talking she was supposed to come hang out and stopped responding to me. It turns out that her ex boyfriend stopped by her apartment and beat her. She had him arrested and then got a temporary protection order against him. 

He has since violated his protection order and has a warrant for his arrest. 

Today he messaged me and said “How brave are you?”. To which I didn’t respond, I don’t know the guy. 

She and I were messaging about this and her child messaged me out of nowhere and said that her and her mom are not safe. 

Any advice on my end? I have no idea how her ex would know we are even talking.",xDemosthenes,2020-04-30 10:14:06,40,154,11.64,94.76,13.15,37.25,14,15.58,96.75,64.29,25.32,21.43,7.79,0.65,0.65,12.34,0,3.9,4.55,11.04,11.04,3.9,9.74,3.25,21.43,0.65,0,1.95,1.3,0.65,1.95,1.3,0.65,0,0.65,0,27.92,0.65,1.3,9.74,5.84,9.74,1.95,1.95,0.65,2.6,0.65,1.95,1.3,0,1.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.04,3.9,1.3,2.6,0.65,3.25,9.74,10.39,0.65,15.58,1.95,4.55,7.79,0,0,0.65,0,0,0,1.95,0,0,0,0,0,12.99,6.49,0.65,0,0,1.3,0,0,2.6,1.95,0,0
gb0m64,Is it rare that i am a guy who is abused by my mom?,"I often feel pretty alone and  talking about my experience cuz, it seems that a lot of people who are victims of such behaviour are women by their male partner or parents. I grew up with my mom she has emotional problems, when i was little my mom would often violently beat me with sticks or hanger or shoes when i ""miss behaved"" leaving me bruised on the legs arms and back, she would course at me in the most hateful way, i felt like if she was a man i would have suffered much greater physical harm but she does not hold back, one time when i was 11 my mom chased me out of the house with a kitchen knife, over the years i always had to apologize for making her mad.

she always say that the reason she beat me cuz i was bad, she oftentimes take up excuse like ""you only remember that i beat you or yell at you how come you don't remember when i bought you expensive toys video games and took you to travel?"" She use less physical violence now but if you just simply have a small disagreement she would lash out in a very violent manner she would rage for several days and i have to hide in my room to avoid confrontation,. I don't know what is it but she always twist thing around so she sounds like the victim and because she is a woman and now i am older i feel like people will not believe me.  I shared this with some friends and coworkers they expressed their supportive attitude but i feel like it still my word against her. 

I am not saying my mom is always violent, when she is not violent she is okay, thought she regularly put me down remark that i am ""useless"" as joke, but she is very easily triggered and often time respond with disproportionate violence.  Its kinda strange cuz my dad had always been the gentle one, he never beat me or course at me, thought he devoiced with my mom, my mom have no friends and messed up every relationship with her family and in-law.  My step dad is okay and not as violent but he has his moment too. 

I am so confused, i feel like if i am a girl people would believe me more, and more supportive? but as a hetero normal guy, it just feel to me  off as i am lying?",100862233,2020-04-30 10:53:40,7,432,14.31,52.78,68.21,1,36,12.5,96.06,61.11,22.45,18.75,10.88,0,1.62,5.56,0.69,3.7,3.7,10.88,9.49,6.48,9.95,2.08,17.13,5.79,3.7,2.08,0.69,2.08,8.8,2.31,6.48,0.46,2.78,0.93,16.9,2.78,1.16,6.94,2.31,15.51,3.47,2.08,2.31,4.17,1.62,4.86,3.01,0.23,1.16,1.39,1.62,0.69,0.46,0,0.46,6.48,1.85,0.93,3.24,0.46,0.93,3.47,10.42,0.23,12.5,1.85,5.09,6.02,0.69,1.62,0.93,0.46,0,0,1.39,0,0.93,0.46,0,0,8.8,1.85,3.94,0,0,0.93,0,0.23,1.39,0.46,0,0

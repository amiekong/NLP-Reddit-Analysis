eyr3cr,Java or Python for High School? Our great debate,"A little background:
I teach high school CS in a district with about 4000 high school students.  We currently offer an Intro to Programming course that is Java based (AP Programming Light since we abandoned Alice), AP Computer Programming (Java based) and AP-CSP which is language independent.

We're updating our curriculum so that the intro course is more interesting and accessible to a wider audience.  We found that 75% of students who take the intro course don't move on to AP. 

We've looked at scratch (no coding), codehs (too similar to our current course and not ""fun"", and Carnegie Mellon (looks great but uses python instead of java).  At the other end of our debate is whether these courses would prepare students for AP Programming, which is Java based.   If we use Python or no coding in the intro course, then our students would be less comfortable transitioning to AP. 

I'm curious what others would do in this instance.  How can we open the course to a wider audience by using drag and drop or Python with Carnegie Mellon's curriculum without shortchanging our students who want to be prepared for an AP level course?

Any suggestions of other curriculum is appreciated!",davidpm,2020-02-04 06:49:12,54,211,67.25,74.66,25.57,70.37,17.58,20.38,81.99,46.45,13.27,7.11,0.95,6.16,0,0,0,6.16,5.21,12.32,7.58,2.37,6.64,2.37,13.74,5.69,2.37,3.32,0.95,1.42,3.32,2.84,0.47,0,0,0.47,9.48,0,0,0,0,13.74,1.42,4.27,2.37,2.37,0,5.69,1.9,1.42,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,12.32,6.16,0,4.27,1.9,0,1.42,10.43,1.42,11.37,0.95,7.11,3.32,11.85,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.59,3.79,2.37,0.47,0,0.95,0.47,0.47,0.95,2.37,4.27,0.47

ezjvq3,Computer Science and Technology Education,"I am a sophomore in high school.

I use Linux as my main operating system and I've created my own website that I pay for hosting and I manage through ssh and ftp. I also do programming in python and C.

As I've learned these skills over the past few years, I've noticed that there really isn't anyone else doing stuff like this. At my middle school I only knew one other guy that liked programming and at my high school there are only three guys that program for fun. The problem I see with the educational system as it is currently is that unless you have a mentor outside of school or you're smart enough to learn through the internet, most people will never have a chance to learn these skills.

I am not arguing for everyone to learn advanced topics like binary trees, linked lists, object oriented programming, but rather a basic education in how to use the tools that are on computers so that students can be efficient and do work well. I have had so many experiences when I see a student asked to do something, and they either don't know how to do it or they do it in some strange and difficult way. An example of this is when a peer was trying to make a color on their logo transparent. They seemed confident and opened up Microsoft word and pasted the image in to edit the image. Yes, Microsoft word. This student was a Junior. There is just a lack of understanding of the platforms and technologies that govern our lives. This may be a tad dramatic, but I worry that this is ruining our generation.

The job market in software development is competitive - not for the people trying to get hired but the companies hiring them. There is a massive demand for programmers and that demand is not being met.

It amazes me that there is such a discrepancy in the incredible technology we have today (computers, self driving cars, the internet) with the lack of skill in using those technologies.

A solution to this problem could be a class implemented into the high school curriculum that teaches students how to use their operating system effectively, and more importantly, to to teach them how to learn from the internet to become more proficient in those tools.

I hope this wan't too much of a rant.

What do you think? If you're a teacher, what are your views on this problem? Students, do you agree with my arguments?",phylopylo,2020-02-05 16:48:35,19,430,50.06,43.53,34.47,29.66,18.7,17.44,89.77,57.44,16.74,8.6,4.88,0.7,1.4,0,1.63,8.14,7.67,13.02,10.47,5.35,7.67,1.4,17.44,4.65,2.33,1.86,0.47,1.86,4.42,2.33,2.09,0.23,0.47,0.23,6.28,0,0.47,0,0.47,13.72,3.49,2.79,2.09,3.02,0.7,3.72,1.63,1.4,0,0,0.7,0,0.7,0,0,10.93,0.93,3.02,5.81,0.7,1.4,3.02,13.49,0.7,8.6,0.47,6.28,1.86,12.09,0.47,0,0.47,0,0,0.7,0,0,0.47,0.23,0,10.93,4.42,3.26,0,0,0.7,0,0.23,0,1.86,0.47,0

f225pq,What would you do - 5th grade dilemma,"I'm looking for some input for what to do in my situation.  I am at a very small, rural K-8 school.  Coding is part of their curriculum, beginning in Kinder with code.org.  This year, I introduced arduino boards to my middle school aged students as an incentive to get them to move onto a text based language.  They loved it, and things have been going great.  

After winter break, half of the fifth grade class began getting pulled for academic intervention half way through our Friday tech class.  I should also say I only see them twice a week.  The students I was left with were my strongest coders, who (in block language) under stand concepts such as functions, variables, conditional statements, and count controlled loops.  With this setup, I started doing video game design with everyone and they are loving it.  When half the class is gone for intervention, I pulled out arduino boards for those who are left and have them working on those, using c++.

Here is the dilemma.  I need something to fill that 25 minute time slot when half the class is gone.  These students are ready to make the jump to a text language, and are excited to do so.  Our classes are small, and with purchasing one extra board, we were set to go.  Unfortunately, the students who leave also want to play with the boards, and their teacher wants to find a way to give everyone the opportunity before students become resentful of having to be pulled to receive extra help. I am torn however.  Not everyone is ready to leave block languages, and while I can use mBlock, I would love to keep arduinos as my motivation to try a ""real"" programming language.

f3g5mx,How to Modernize our Highschool CS Program?,"TL;DR:  Adding CS classes to our current small curriculum.  Would like our students to be prepared for their future industry and college experiences.

Hi!  I'm a high school teacher at Burlington High School in Iowa.  My principal asked me to investigate what would be a desirable curriculum for students going into University of Iowa.

We currently have:

\-An Introduction to Programming class

One trimester.  Covers several languages including how to use C# with Visual Studio

\-Computer Science Principles

We mostly teach Python using PLTW's curriculum, but we are currently looking at alternatives, partly due to recent changes in PLTW's program.  This is treated as our second course after Intro to Programming.

We are looking into adding:

\-A 1 trimester app development class that (I think) focuses on using C# with Visual Studios.  One of our teachers already has materials for this and looks forward to teaching it.  

These three classes would be the first 2 years of our program, but we would like to expand.  

The intro and app class are small.  So we are also looking to add at least 3 more trimesters of classes, where classes range in size from 1 to 3 trimesters.

Here are some of the options we are considering.  Some of these may be offered as independent studies too, such as Data Science.:

\-High Industry demand, but somewhat niche:    

Data Science, Cyber Security, Machine Learning, Additional app learning

\-High Student Demand courses, but may not be best for industry or college preparation. (Possibly as a carrot to take the introductory classes):

Video Game Development

We could offer more classes if they were small.  We also are thinking about using the last year as a project based capstone course where they might work on an app for a business for example.  Would you recommend this?  

The principal also wants classes that flow into eachother fairly well in a way that encourages high skill and rigor at the ending courses.  Though I'm not sure that this is as necessary with Computer Science.  For example, CSA is one of the more challenging classes, but I think it could be tackled after taking 2 trimesters of programming and not 5 trimesters if its the course we add.  But a strict order to the curriculum is very advantageous or allow us to do more with the third and fourth year classes?

f4akwi,Innovative Scratch inspired tool to gently introduce students to coding exercises,"I built this when I realised that my students were having trouble solving coding exercises. When I say ""coding exercises"" I mean that I would give them a specification and ask them to write the code to achieve the desired effect. These kinds of exercises can be found on exercises such as leetcode or codewars.

I created this tool as a stepping stone before they can tackle real exercises. Basically, when I give them an exercise, I also tell them which syntactic structures they can use. Instead of writing code, they assemble the structures together like in the Scratch programming system. For many exercises, I make it easier for them by assembling some of the blocks. 

The result is that the student doesn't have to deal with syntax errors and doesn't have to figure out which syntactic patterns they have to use for which problems. I can also make hard problems easier by filling in the gaps.

Also, when I ask them to implement an algorithm, I first have them write out 3 test cases to make sure they understand the algorithm first.

f7ej8h,Did I hinder my son's ability to gain CS skills because of how limited his computer usage was throughout his childhood?,"I'm a father of 2 sons. My older one (20) is in college and has always been the obedient and studious of the two, and has shown demonstrable growth and potential. My younger one (17) however is more of the rebellious and problem child that loves to wrangle out of my control.

At around 11 we found him looking at content not suitable for his age, and since then we've put parental controls and time restrictions on the computer. the doctor also recommended limiting screen time and exposure.

This worked well for a while, but then multiple times he found a way around the filters and kept violating our rules of usage and time. Every time we took it away for a long time and tightened the controls. Everything went well for some time, until I checked the browsing history and found that he had violated the rules again, and was now going on troll sites that aren't good for him.

This was also the time where he got his own computer that I got from my coworker's son who moved away to college, so before giving this to him, we made sure that he couldn't bypass our restrictions. We put Windows controls on it that can't be bypassed, so we can know what he looks up and what sites he goes on. He also must fill out a form that logs his hours, because now there is a zero tolerance policy. 2 a day, no more. He must report everything he does to us, because he's consistently shown he can't be trusted with any privacy or autonomy, so now I've imposed a policy similar to my work; everything must be transparent to the authority, and if there's any pushback or resistance, there will be consequences. His computer is now out in the open so there's peer pressure to stay obedient.

Around this time my son was 16 going on 17, and started to express discontent over our ""draconian"" rules, because the controls often filter sites that are totally safe and locks him out in the middle of games, and when we're away he can't get the password to allow more time. I said that as long as he lives here then he will abide by the rules, and this inconvenience and restriction will teach him not to be so rebellious and deceitful. Plus I'm paying for the internet and electricity, he has no right to complain. And time extensions will not be honored unless it's for homework, but if he wants to learn skills on Khan Academy, he's out of luck, stop playing games then. And there are people in China who are much less fortunate. Even my MIL says I'm right.

f8uskj,Class on building computers (Useful for post secondary studies or a future career?)," I posted this on r/computerscience but I think this is the more appropriate place for it.  

I have a student that wants to help me run a class on building computers this summer for my high school.  He wants to focus on buying cheap parts online (on sale, used, etc.) to get really cheap computers.  He also showed me a curriculum where students learn about the parts and their function.  

First, I think this is an awesome idea! But I want to know how helpful this would be for a future career in computers, partly because I want to make sure I'm offering a class that provides academic or career value to the students and partly so I might have something to tell my principal (who seems to be mostly on board with the idea already.)

I know this could probably help getting computer repair jobs, for a person's own computer, or for a side gig building computers.

But what I'm interested in is if this would be very helpful for someone pursuing computer science, getting an IT job, repairing a company's heavy duty hardware, such as a server, or something else that could help with post secondary or a quality career.",AduroMelior,2020-02-24 09:36:42,14,216,66.94,30.53,39.76,83.41,21.6,20.37,90.28,52.31,15.74,7.87,6.48,0,0,0.93,0.46,7.87,7.87,12.5,6.94,5.09,7.41,0,15.74,4.17,0.93,1.85,0.46,1.39,3.24,3.24,0,0,0,0,6.48,0,0,0,0.93,18.52,3.7,1.85,4.17,6.94,0.46,5.09,0.93,0.46,0,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,7.41,2.31,0.46,4.63,1.39,0,1.85,11.57,2.31,9.26,0.46,5.56,2.31,12.96,0,0,1.85,0,0,0.93,0,0.46,0.46,0,0,14.35,3.7,4.63,0,0,0.46,0.46,0,0,1.85,2.78,0.46

fiauoj,Coding activity for a coding club: Calculate PI by measuring the area of a circle ... in JavaScript,"&amp;#x200B;

# Calculate PI by measuring the area of a circle ... in JavaScript

This is a fun little JavaScript program that you can implement on your own or together with some young coders at a coding club or at home.

## Math

The approximative value of π is known since the times of Archimedes. Over the years many mathematicians and researchers were preoccupied with calculating the value of PI with a higher and higher precision. Lots of new methods have been found to calculate the value of this intriguing number.

Knowing π is very important as its value is used in many mathematical applications. Probably the most well-known applications are determining the circumference and area of a circle of known radius.

In this article we will attempt to calculate the approximative value of π using a method that even a middle schooler will understand - we will measure manually the area of a circle and then work in reverse to determine π.

We know from the math class that area of a circle is:

&gt;A = πr²

We usually solve this equation for area or radius. But this time we will solve the equation for π.

&gt;π = A / r²

## Algorithm

To solve this equation, we will use an empirical method with the help of JavaScript. The method is quite simple:

* Step 1: Assume a circle of radius r
* Step 2: Enclose the circle in a tight square. The square will have sides equal to the diameter of the circle
* Step 3: Determine the area of the circle by counting all pixels that are inside the circle
* Step 4: Determine π by dividing the area to the radius squared, like in the formula above

&amp;#x200B;

**Challenge 1.** As you can see the algorithm is simple, but the first challenge already appeared. At step #3 we said that when we need to determine if a point is inside the circle or not.

In order to do this, we will scan all the points inside the outer square and determine if that point is inside the circle or not. This is achieved by comparing the radius of the circle with the distance from that particular point to the center of the circle.

If the distance is smaller or equal than the radius, then the point is inside the circle.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2fi4j9gzkjm41.png?width=1047&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c70134489d741bb5b234bf358ff235b3cede9a33

Since this is an empirical method, we will try to improve the precision of the calculations by using a large enough circle. Using a circle with a small radius may result in less precise π approximation due to a less than ideal circle. See the following image:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yxzfrh60ljm41.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbc251010fdcb0bc0c771b733b57ee7332163062

**Challenge 2.** The previous challenge raised a new challenge on its own. How do we determine the distance between two points?

The answer is: with the help of a little bit of geometry knowledge and Pythagorean theorem.

Since we know the coordinates of the two points, we can determine the triangle sides and then find the hypotenuse using the theorem of Pythagoras.

The following image should be self-explanatory for this.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we have all the data we need to start writing the JavaScript code that will calculate π.

You can use any JavaScript environment or playground to write the code. In this article we will use the free [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com) environment (go ahead and create a free account -- you'll have fun).

Although we talked until now only about graphical concepts, the code won’t use any graphical library. We can implement this algorithm using only pure JavaScript without drawing circles or squares.

    println(p);

        var area = 0;
    
        // Scan all the pixels inside the square
        for(var x = 0; x &lt; diameter; x++)
        {
            for(var y = 0; y &lt; diameter; y++)
            {
                // Calculate the distance from each pixel
                // to the center of the circle
                var d = dist(x, y, r, r);

                {
                    // If distance is less than the radius
                    // then add it to the area of the circle
                    area++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate PI by dividing the area to the 
        return area / (r * r);
    }

If you copy the above code in the [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com) editor and run it, you will see the result displayed:

    3.1415

This is pretty accurate for such simple empirical method!

Note: Please notice that we didn’t defined the dist function that calculates the distance between two points. This is because this function is already defined in [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com). However, if you want to run the code outside [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com), then you can easily implement this function in just a few lines of code as explained above. We will leave the exercise of dist function implementation to the interested readers.

## Visualizing the circle

As you saw there is no need to use any graphical library to calculate the π using this method. However, since we are in a graphical environment, let’s have a little bit of fun and visualize the points that we are scanning.

We will use the point function to plot the scanned point in either “teal” (if is inside the circle), or “lightblue” if is outside the circle.

Just add the following `stroke()` and `point()` lines in the right place:

    ...
                if (d &lt;= r)
                {
                    // If distance is less than the radius
                    // then add it to the area of the circle
                    area++;
                    
                    stroke(""teal"");
                }
                else
                {
                    stroke(""lightblue"");
                }
                
                point(x, y);
    ...

And this is the execution effect:

&amp;#x200B;

fo712i,"We are Carnegie Mellon University Students, and we help build CMU CS Academy: a free, online, High School programming curriculum. AMA about remote instruction for Computer Science education!","Hi Everyone,

As classrooms transition into remote learning, we believe there is a shift in focus of many aspects of delivering instruction. One of the most important aspects is student engagement. While student engagement is always incredibly important in the classroom, at times where these students are relatively isolated, focusing on creativity, collaboration and interactivity is crucial. 

We’ve designed an **entirely** **free** program that works well in both synchronous and asynchronous learning settings. In many ways the materials really focus on some of the most important parts of remote instruction. For example, we have an incredibly flexible curriculum that handles most of the technical instruction, allowing for teachers to act as facilitators of their students’ learning . Our content is designed around creativity, problem solving and interactivity while also providing immediate feedback to students with an online IDE and autograder. There is a Teacher Portal full of resources for teachers to monitor student progress, assign collaborative tasks, quizzes and view grades from afar. We also understand that this is a very small window to try to learn a new platform. Our team is always available to provide support through our site and we are running daily open webinars to get you started! [Sign up for a free teacher account](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/r/1888).

Greeting all!  My name is Lily Romano, and I'm a senior at Bucknell University. I have a quick survey (2 required questions) regarding version control systems (VCS) in secondary and higher education.  

The survey can be found here: [https://forms.gle/WmG1pBfQGNvp8PPn8](https://forms.gle/WmG1pBfQGNvp8PPn8)

Background: I'm working on a tool to support courses using Agile and Scrum during the course of a programming project.  Currently, the plan is to work with GitLab, as that is what my University uses.  However, I would like to see what other schools use to determine how the tool will evolve.

Later in the semester, I hope to send out a more detailed survey for data gathering/research/publication purposes.  If you are interested in completing that survey as well, let me know in the optional section.

Finally, if you are further interested in the tool, [there is a summary located here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lqndXCxxtwyXPpoC4Pyv_vsFHgBN6w6gNKQ-ewrw1Vs/edit?usp=sharing), or you contact me for more information at [lily.romano@bucknell.edu](mailto:lily.romano@bucknell.edu)",Lilyheart,2020-03-25 06:51:18,1,197,85.58,41.96,55.48,94.88,19.7,28.43,71.57,40.61,8.63,6.09,4.57,0,1.52,0,0,2.54,6.6,12.18,7.11,3.55,5.58,0,12.69,5.08,4.06,1.52,0.51,2.03,4.57,4.57,0,0,0,0,4.57,0,0.51,0,0,11.68,2.54,3.55,2.03,3.05,0.51,3.55,0.51,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.61,1.52,2.54,3.55,0,0,0.51,10.66,1.52,13.2,0.51,8.12,4.57,8.12,0,0,0,0,0,2.03,0,1.52,0,0.51,0,33.5,7.61,5.08,1.52,0,0.51,0.51,0.51,0,1.02,6.09,10.66

fqwh06,Teacher looking to Co-Learn some basic programming with 8th graders while school is in distance learning mode,"Hey Everyone: 

First post for me! 

I'm a  math and science teacher at a middle school in Salem, OR where I teach Algebra 1 and Physical Science. 

As with the majority of schools in the US, we are embarking on this ""voluntary distance learning"" model for the foreseeable future. Since it's voluntary, and new, I'd like to emphasize fun for a while with some introductory computer programming.

I am not a programmer. I have basic .html and .css skills from a previous life as a blogger but that's about it.

I'm looking for some recommendations on fully online, learn to program websites that my students and I can do together. 

We've played a little bit with Khan Academy and [code.org](https://code.org) in class. And today I played around with [codecombat.com](https://codecombat.com)  which seemed like my kids would like it. But I really have no idea where to start. 

What I do know is that I don't want to be dragging blocks around. I want my kids to be typing actual code. This idea in itself may be flawed--I really don't know much.

Please point me in the right direction! Thanks so much.",fitmacdaddy,2020-03-28 17:46:35,22,219,60.15,23.25,88.83,76.42,13.69,17.81,86.3,52.05,15.07,9.59,8.22,1.37,0,0,0,5.48,5.02,15.53,10.05,4.11,6.85,1.83,16.89,3.65,2.28,1.83,0.91,3.2,2.74,2.74,0,0,0,0,4.11,0,0,0,0,10.96,4.11,0.46,1.37,2.74,0.46,2.74,0.91,0.91,0,0,0.91,0,0.91,0,0,4.57,1.83,0.91,1.83,0,0,2.28,12.33,1.37,14.61,0,10.05,4.11,11.87,1.83,0,0,0,0,1.37,0,0.91,0,0,0,22.83,8.68,2.28,0.46,0,0,0.91,1.37,0.91,3.65,1.83,2.74

First, we aim to create a place where developers can freely ask questions, collaborate, learn all while having fun and making friends. It's similar to Stackoverflow.com, but the key difference is that we want to make sure that you understood what we're saying and learn. Arrogance, looking down on others, discrimination for lack of knowledge is not tolerated.  

We also do free code reviews, we have an ongoing large-scale boot camp covering topics like C#, OOP, SOLID, testing, design patterns, client development, web services, security and async programming. Last but not least, we do mock job interviews.

It has become a struggle now.

Also what could I suggest to the teachers in CS class considering they're not advanced users nor do any programming or such?

I am currently finishing up my first year of CS courses at a CC in northern Cal. I’m looking to begin out of class projects to start building my resume, but mainly for overall practice. Was wondering if anyone had any good ideas, topics or experiences they’d like to share. What type of projects would look best on resumes? How have projects, or lack of projects, affected your internship and job opportunities?

4.5Lakh/Student!

These people are making money by playing with the insecurities of Tier 2-3 University students.  
In a video ""Why We Do What We Do"" they ask to join only if we want to learn rather than for referrals.  
Well nobody is paying 4.5 Lakh just for learning they are actually paying for getting refferal which they have being advertising everywhere on their platform.  
As much as learning is concerned there are wonderful and plenty of free resources available to learn even if paid resources is taken in consideration they cost max to 10K and as much as referral is concerned anyone on linkedin would be happy to refer you as long as you can earn their trust that you are worth referring.

They are making money by abusing the insecurities of Tier 2-3 students that they can't land anywhere in Top companies as they are not from Tier 1 university which isn't at all true especially if you want to be in Tech industry.

Being a student myself i want to request to all the students out there-:

""Being in Tier 2-3 University doesn't in anyway going to stop us from working in top Companies.  
All we need is right resources and strategies for learning.  
Don't let these people make money out of your insecurities.

eowjab,whats the best way to get out of an abusive relationship with my parents?,"i’m currently unemployed, and ive dropped out of high school because of my depression. every day i have to deal with my parents screaming, hitting and threatening me. I dont have any friends i can go to. i’m not sure if any relative would take me in, and even then, i want to keep contact with my parents minimal to zero. my issue is i have severe PTSD from other events to the point where leaving my house is too hard for me, and im not sure how i can maintain a stable job because of this. My dream is to get as far as fuck away from my toxic shitty town. i have eu citizenship, which is a start i guess? my issue is that my parents control every little aspect of my life (doctor appointments, psych appointments, contact i have with other people, etc.) and because of this i don’t know how to do a lot of things most adults know how to do. i dont know where to start if i were to leave, and how to manage myself. another issue i have is that my parents have falsely reported me to the police, and they’re on my ass, and dont believe anything i say to them about what they do to me. they manipulate my psychologist appointments, where they have to talk to my psych instead of just me. i know they say bullshit to make them look good, and me look bad as ive heard them do this before, but the problem is that i don’t know how many people they’ve done this to. i need help. im not sure how much longer ill last.",throwaway3839394849,2020-01-14 19:16:42,1,294,16.31,8.16,86.26,9.18,18.38,13.27,93.54,62.24,23.47,18.37,15.65,0,0,0,2.72,5.1,2.72,14.97,12.93,4.76,8.5,2.72,20.75,3.4,2.38,3.74,0.34,3.06,4.76,1.7,3.06,0.34,1.36,0.34,8.84,1.7,1.02,0,0,14.29,2.04,4.08,2.04,2.72,1.7,3.06,2.38,0.68,1.36,0.34,2.38,0.68,1.36,0.34,0,7.48,2.72,0.34,3.06,1.7,1.02,1.36,20.07,0.34,8.84,1.02,5.1,2.38,3.4,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,1.36,1.36,0,0,0,0,13.27,4.76,5.1,0,0,0.68,0,0,0,2.04,0.68,0

that I could never take back

The others were warning flags

You flicked away

With your casual cruelty

accusations

hypocrisy

and threats

I had one arrow left

that I could never take back

But I had to make you stop

hurting me

I nocked the arrow

I drew the bowstring

and aimed it at your heart

You were confused

when it pierced your armored shell

The blood on your fingers

is an Old Wound, ripped open

I watch you from a distance now

I see your pain

And you will never know 

the stain

that arrow

My mother and I have been getting into verbal fights lately and the more I try to stay away from her, the more she tries to interact with me. 

The other day I asked her for help with my laptop to install a program (it was a virus app that was free through our internet provider) but as the conversation kept going, we both became more aggressive until she threatened to hit me with her phone if I didn’t start  behaving. 

Earlier today we had a fight about why our relationship was bad and I told her the reason why was because I don’t like being threatened to be hit. She brushed it off as saying doing something like that is only discipline and I need to stop whining about it.

eoxu63,Need help describing trauma,"I know this might sound weird but i am having trouble explaining to my partner about how mental abuse and trauma can change a person without them realizing it. For example they would be doing/ saying things that they wouldn't normally do. He understands the physical stuff like flashbacks, flinching, panic attacks etc. But he's been having a hard time understanding that sometimes a person is not mentally the same for a while after even if they seem fine and can do things out of the ordinary without meaning to. ( slight personality change, more reckless and daring behaviour ) 

I came out of a year and a half severely mentally abusive relationship, lost my grandfather to cancer and a friend to  suicide while still attending college and having psychosis all within a year. Mind you my whole life has been abuse and i never really got to understand what is right and wrong or how i should be treated.

My parter is also the first non abusive relationship that I've ever been in, and the first time I've ever been treated right. So finding out things that i think are normal ( having to give into sex or being an object ) that really are not is also hard for me to mentally adjust to.

I just need help explaining that going through all that can really temporally change a persons behaviour without them knowing about it and how people react after a trauma isn't their true personality.",beautyandthemask,2020-01-14 21:07:49,1,249,25.61,31.5,78.35,1,24.9,18.88,92.77,58.63,15.26,9.24,5.62,0,0.4,0.8,2.41,6.02,6.43,11.24,13.25,6.83,9.24,3.21,19.28,5.62,2.01,1.61,1.2,1.61,6.83,1.2,5.62,0.4,2.01,0.4,9.64,0.4,0.8,0,1.2,19.68,4.82,2.81,2.81,2.81,2.41,6.02,1.61,0,0.8,0.8,1.61,0,1.2,0.4,0,5.62,2.41,1.2,1.2,0.8,0.8,2.81,10.84,0.8,12.85,3.21,3.21,6.43,0.4,0,0,0,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.64,3.61,2.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.01,1.61,0.4

eoxx0a,Was i abused?,"Disclaimer: Hadn’t thought about this string of events in years. I think I actually repressed them but I’m not sure, I was listening to a podcast about a sexual abuse survivor and the memory washed over me. It still seems hazy.

I had a neighbor back when I was very little (probably 3-6, sometime in the preschool kindergarten area) and we were friends and would hang out. He convinced me to let him look up my butt and “inspect me”, both my butt and genitals, and this happened on multiple occasions. I remember eventually my parents caught us it and after that point I don’t remember seeing him again. He was older (not by a lot) and I remember it pretty vaguely but I’m pretty sure it happened event though it seems almost dreamlike/repressed.

I don’t know what to do with this information since it recently reappeared in my head. Was this abuse or am I crazy? It seems real but also has a weird dream vibe to it.

ep1p8r,I was mentally manipulated into believing Reddit was just a place for Incels. And I was supposed to never be allowed social media.,"Hello, I'm completely new to reddit.
My parents were strict as fuck abusive bible thumping parents that barred their 9 children including me from most of the internet. I could get away with kik, YouTube, and Ifunny on the down low. 

After I came out at age 16 and my father disowned and kicked me out I immediately got a facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr (which I now hate) and then never thought much of reddit. To be honest a lot of that had to do with my parents brain washing. My dad talked about reddit all the time and how its users were leftist Incels that had no respect for anyone.

And so as a result I grew up thinking everyone on Reddit was some misogynistic neck beard with a fedora. Because when I asked what Incel meant at the dinner table I can recall my eldest sibling told me just that ""A misogynistic neck beard with a fedora"". He wasn't wrong... Just my dad was in saying that everyone on here is like that.

I'm still getting used to shedding some of the bull shit my parents told me or made me believe even though its been 4 years. But mental abuse and other horrific abuse will do that to you. Being autistic makes it harder to understand that I was in fact being abused. But I was known as the gullible and easily manipulated one in my family.
As a result I've turned myself into a very facts based person. I love facts especially since they can win a lot of arguments. Yeah, arguing... That was like my family's favorite thing to do except mine.

That aside
Lately I have been getting into some YouTube videos about some interesting reddit conversations. Which made me realize that Reddit is not at all what my parents tried to make me believe. In fact its just another part of the internet, like facebook. So upon realizing this... At 3am doing my dishes... I immediately installed Reddit as like yet another giant fuck you to my parents.

So I'm genuinely wanting to make friends on here and if you have a similar experience to mine with parents restricting basically any and all social media please share.

But yeah... I guess its crucial information to know first where's the side bar? And second what's a subreddit and what makes it different from a regular Reddit log?",FormidablyAtypical,2020-01-15 04:28:58,7,426,47.48,35.35,76.59,15.81,14.2,16.9,91.55,56.81,18.31,11.03,9.62,0,0.7,0.23,0.47,7.28,4.93,15.02,8.45,6.34,7.51,1.17,17.37,4.23,3.29,2.11,1.41,3.52,4.93,2.11,2.82,0,2.35,0.23,9.62,2.82,0.23,0,0.94,15.73,3.29,3.76,0.7,3.05,3.05,2.58,0.94,0.23,0.23,0.23,3.05,1.41,0.23,0.47,0.7,8.45,4.46,0.7,2.35,1.17,0.23,7.28,7.75,0.47,10.8,0.7,6.1,3.99,0,4.23,0.23,0,0.23,0,3.76,0.7,2.58,0.47,0,0,13.85,8.92,1.64,0,0,0.47,0,0,0.47,1.88,0.47,0
ep3q19,Continuation of: My [F19] boyfriend [M19] has made me hate my body.,"My [F19] boyfriend [M19] has made me hate my body.

Here’s the problem: My boyfriend that I love very much has expressed to me several times in the past that he isn’t attracted to my body anymore like he was when we first met and now he’s being even more passive aggressive by asking me to go to the gym with him over and over. We’ve gotten into argument after argument over it, at one point I was begging for him to just not bring it up anymore yet it’s always brought up eventually. Just the other day him &amp; his mom picked me up and I was told we were going to the mall but low and behold we end up at the gym and they’re signing up. I was beyond peeved. His mother also makes comments such as how I could tone up &amp; this &amp; that. It’s eating me alive and my self confidence is in the gutter. At one point I was so confident with my body and now I hate my body to the point it’s hard to look at myself in the mirror. It’s like I must be so ugly that not even someone I love finds me attractive anymore. My parents always make comments about how “fat” I am so I feel like everyone is against me. What do I do?

TL;DR: Boyfriend doesn’t find me attractive anymore and keeps asking me to go to the gym even after I’ve told him several times not to ask or talk about it because it hurts. What should I do?

For context: I prefer They/Them;26

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I can never take it back. I know that I can never undo all the damage that you did to my psyche. I know I can never take back the burn mark you left on my soul, the mark of your hand on my very core. I know all these things. What I don’t know is why I’m still so angry. I’m not this mean or angry or anything like that. I’ve never thought of myself like that, not really. But you. You made me into this monster that I didn’t recognize. I didn’t know who I was looking at in the mirror. I didn’t love myself anymore. I didn’t like anything about myself.

I felt like I was just a hair away from losing myself, my mind, my life every single second you were around. Other days, I couldn’t bring myself to feel anything and I had to wear a mask. If I didn’t, my entire world would fall apart because you would hurt everyone I love. You would lash out and scream and kick and get super fucking high on whatever you could get your hands on. You ruined everything if you didn’t get your way. And I had to be the one to take it all just so everyone around me wasn’t affected by the blows. No one understood it though. Not really. And that’s okay because it meant they were safe. That’s all I wanted. I wanted them to be safe from you. I never wanted you to be happy though, I wanted you to suffer. That is how I know you made me into someone I wasn’t and I wasn’t like this. I wasn’t this cruel or sadistic or crazy-sounding, it was your burn mark on my soul. It was your grip on my throat getting ever so tighter. 

At first, I thought I was going to be alright again. I thought the love of my life and I were going to be safe again. I thought we could get our life back on track and you were allowing me to be happy again. I thought after letting others, who were toxic to my life, go and moving in with you would finally give me some peace of mind. I thought I’d finally have a friend again after not having anyone there for me when I was suicidal and so utterly alone. I thought all these changes would benefit us. I thought I was going to be happier than I had ever been. I never knew..it could ruin me. I never knew that everything involving you would rip our lives apart. 

Now I understand you think you are a victim in everything even though, you were the one who screamed at me. I understand that you think you have every right to me and you think I’m your property. I understand that you HAD to be my only friend and I tried to have another, you would tear them down and ruin it with all your craziness and lies. I understand that you saw me in a certain light because I was kind and patient. I understand that you built up this unreachable and impossible image of me in your head but you need to understand that I am not responsible for that. I am human and I am vulnerable. No one is that patient and everyone has a limit. You just never saw mine. You never saw or respected my boundaries even if I laid them out for you plain and simple. You never cared about my boundaries or why I have them.

You never saw how mad I was at you. Or how I screamed and cried into my pillow because I was left alone to deal with your cruelty. You never saw how you disrespected me, on a daily basis, by just being your destructive self. You never saw how hard I fought to keep my sanity together. You never saw how my self-esteem was shot every time you talked about my weight to my face. Or how sick I made myself because I couldn’t bring myself to eat after you mocked my weight. You never see how damaging you are to anyone around you. You never see anything besides yourself because it’s just so unfathomable to do so!

If you ""loved"" me so much, why would you destroy the kitchen every time you made dinner and never cleaned it? You knew that I hated the way you lived in complete disarray and filth. You would throw down everything you had in your hands from wherever when you went everywhere. You constantly left food out so we ended up getting cockroaches in the kitchen. You always depended on me to clean the kitchen and when my chronic illness got the better of me, I couldn’t clean it for a few days. When I couldn’t be your maid, you always threw a fit because nothing was clean and we didn’t have any clean pans and because you didn’t cook, everyone would decide to eat out. After a few days of this, you would get mad at “everyone” for eating out. When really, you were just mad at me because I wasn’t your butler when you “needed” me to be. I told you that I hated that several times for a year and a half but you never listened. You always said you were sorry and maybe I was taking it the wrong way and you “promised” to help me “tomorrow”. Well, tomorrow always came but you never lifted a finger. Oh no, wait I’m forgetting about the handful of times you did help me and would scream at whoever made the tiniest of messes in “your” kitchen.

If I was so important to you, why did you have to get so high that we thought you OD’ed? While in your high state of mind, you took out all of your real feelings on everyone in the house and scared everyone half to death. All because you weren’t getting enough attention from me or everyone, you went and relapsed. You were tripping hard, driving and acting like you were the goddamn victim in everything for a week and no one knew because a drug addict knows how to hide it. Heroin is not to be fucked with.

 I’m now expecting you to come back or to try to claw your way back into my life. I’m waiting for you to text me and get passive-aggressive about how I haven’t texted you or hung out with you. I think you might’ve gotten the picture but I don’t think that’s possible. Maybe you’re mad at me? Or maybe you think I'm an asshole now? Or maybe you’re just too high to function again? I don’t..I can’t give in to this bliss in the lack of your presence. I’m happy..ish? I just want those pieces of myself that you took back. I wanna be able to live my life and be myself again. The sad part is, I don’t think I know who that is anymore. Can I start over? Can I get over it? In time, yes. But right now? No. I don’t know yet. And it’s sickening and festering. I’m just waiting for my whole world to fall apart again. I want to be happy and I have moments where I’m happy but..I know that I’m not because I don’t have closure and I’m not over everything you did to me. 

Now I’m just sitting on my ass and waiting for you to rip another piece from us again. When’s it coming? What are you doing? What are you planning? Are you looking for a way to hurt me again? I can’t stand living like this. I tell people to stay away from you and I tell them little things you have done to not only me but everyone who knows you and they can’t believe it. I've been told that it sounds like I have a mild form of PTSD. I'm about to go to a doctor and talk about what I could do.

I think I know the difference between you and them now. When they say they love me, it feels real. It’s genuine. And I’m terrified. Of course, I’m scared though. I’m scared that it won’t be real anymore or that this life I have now is all a dream. I keep waking up though and I’m still here, I’m still in a new apartment. In all that pain and suffering..I never thought I would get here. I was in a cycle of doubt, anxiety and endless darkness. I never believed I could get out of there because you stole every shred of hope I had, every chance you could without fail. So why would I believe that I would be free? I had plenty of reasons to leave. And thankfully, through a beautiful chain reaction, I was given my freedom from you. 

Someone asked me how does it feel not living with you anymore, besides all the craziness and the dictatorship. I took a long time to answer because yes, it’s great for several reasons but I said: “It’s..quiet”. It’s so..quiet and all I want to do is cry. Cry for the pieces of myself I lost but cry for the weight of you is finally off my heart and my shoulders. Yes, your mark is still there but it’ll fade, they all have and they all do. I can breathe and cry and speak and be me again. Yes, there are pieces of me that have been taken but..I’ve grown before and I can grow again. I have to, not only for my loved ones but for me. I have to do things for myself again. I want to and that is what matters. I want to live life again and I feel like I will be able to soon. I will be able to forget you and give myself closure. Maybe not today but I will.

I will be able to let it go. I will let go of the damage you did to me because I am not your property.",BubblyMasterpiece0,2020-01-15 14:15:32,0,1736,3.69,40.21,95.37,8.55,13.25,11.18,95.62,67.74,27.65,20.91,12.62,0.46,6.97,0,0.86,6.74,2.94,11.75,12.04,8.35,8.53,4.15,22.64,3.69,1.09,2.19,0.63,2.19,5.59,2.07,3.51,0.4,1.15,1.15,11.81,0,0.17,0.06,0,18.43,3.69,2.59,2.88,2.36,3.92,4.67,3.05,0.92,0.75,1.38,3.46,0.75,1.5,0.12,0.75,5.36,1.21,0.81,1.61,1.56,0.52,7.03,12.56,1.04,13.02,1.5,5.7,6.22,0.23,0.12,0.52,0.06,0.12,0.12,0.81,0.29,0,0.35,0.12,0,16.53,7.6,2.42,0.17,0.23,0.81,0.06,0.17,0.81,4.09,0,0.17
epbxil,Advice please: the anniversary gift problem,"So, my husband and I are struggling with money at the moment, so much so that I have had to take up a job I hate just to help pay bills.  Because the budget is tight, we agreed to not buy each other or family or friends gifts for birthdays or Christmas.  We ever agreed to no wedding anniversary gifts for each other.  No unnecessary expenses.  I have not bought anyone, including myself, anything while he has spent hundreds on his nieces and nephews and best friend.  Nothing for me, though (this is important later).

Beginning of the new year, i have a car accident.  I am not hurt but the car is totaled.  I am stressed and having a break down because it is another bill (rental car) and another potential bill (new car loan) to pay. All he cares about is how high our insurance payment is going to go.  My mom knows I am stressed and asks him to get me a bar of chocolate on the way home, just to show he cares.  Instead he comes home and screams at me about how he’s broke and how my mother is harassing him and how he doesn’t give a shit about my problems and from now on he is not giving a damn about me or my problems because he can’t afford to be stressed all the time.  He then runs to the bathroom and throws up and blames me for stressing him out.

A few days later is our anniversary.  I have to work a 12 hour shift.  I wake up to find boxes of expensive chocolates on my computer desk.  He tells me that was all he could afford and since I always buy whatever I want for myself it was all he could think to get me.  I angrily throw everything into the fridge and leave for work.  He proceeds to text me every hour about how expensive the chocolates were and how he needed to remind me that he does care and I should be grateful.  I have not touched the chocolates since he bought them almost a week ago.  And now he is royally pissed at me and eating them himself, telling me I am ungrateful and he is never getting me anything again.

So ... am I being an asshole?  I mean ... he tried to do something nice but ... I don’t know.  I feel like if I eat them then I’m surrendering to him.  I’m admitting he did something right when he didn’t and I admit that I was wrong.  What do I do?",Alorxico,2020-01-15 17:21:33,4,438,14,30.78,54.57,4.69,14.6,14.38,96.58,63.01,22.6,18.26,10.5,0.91,0,6.16,0.68,4.34,4.79,11.42,10.5,5.94,10.27,2.97,18.95,2.51,0.91,2.05,0.46,2.51,7.08,2.51,4.57,1.14,1.6,0.46,12.56,1.6,0.46,0.68,6.62,14.16,1.83,2.51,2.05,2.74,2.28,4.11,1.37,0.23,0.23,0.91,2.51,0.91,0,0,1.6,7.53,2.28,1.14,2.51,1.14,1.14,3.2,14.61,0.91,13.47,2.51,3.65,7.08,1.83,0.68,1.37,4.34,0.23,0,0.91,0.91,0,0,0,0,13.24,7.53,2.05,0.23,0,0.46,0,0,0,1.6,1.37,0

epcxi8,I defended myself when she started to hit me.,"My mother and father always hit me, as a child, as a teenager and as an adult. I'm almost 20 years old and living with my mother. 

I started to defend myself in highschool when I started Thai box, when she's threaten me or try to hit me I'd put my guard up. The first time it happened she told me to put my hands down, I said ""no, I'm not going to let you hit me"", she insisted and I never put my guard down until she stopped theatening me. 

Now today, at 19 I have a lot of anger issues and I'm very scared of being touched in certain areas or grabbed in general. I tend to react violently to being grabbed, out of fear, even when I don't mean it. 

Well today my mom wanted to try me, she grabbed me pretty violently and I yanked her arm off me pretty violently too, well she wasn't too happy about it and we had a fight, a literal fight. I, a 19 year old woman, fought my own, 48 years old, mother. 

I was screaming like a maniac, I thought it would make her back off because of the neighbors and I was very scared too, knowing some of the things she did to me as a teenager. My screams of fear didn't make her back off but she did get very offended when I screamed for help. 

She then proceeded to tell me to get out of the house and not come back, which is ridiculous since I was trying to leave in the first place before she put herself in my path and grabbed me. 

I left, walking, after spraining both of my ankles a total of 3 times. 

 She also told me ""I'm your mother and you have to respect me"" I responded ""I'm your child and you have to respect me and treat me like a human being"" and she almost said something along the lines of: I can hit you if I want to (because I'm her ""child""). 

I feel ridiculous and pathetic for reacting violently, I acted like her, got down to her pathetic level and I feel awful for that. 

Parents don't own their kids, parents aren't entitled to hitting their kids. 

Where I live a lot of people will tell you that it's ok to hit your child to teach them a lesson or respect. The only thing I learned growing up getting hit is that I have to be scared  and physical defend myself against them.",Weirdo30,2020-01-15 18:40:37,6,436,28.51,42.71,86.99,1,24.22,12.84,95.64,61.7,24.54,21.79,14.22,0.23,1.83,4.59,0.92,2.75,4.59,14.91,7.8,5.73,8.26,2.06,20.41,3.67,2.06,1.61,1.61,1.15,8.72,2.52,6.19,1.38,2.98,0.46,14.91,1.83,0.23,5.96,0.23,9.86,1.61,1.61,0.92,3.44,0.92,2.52,2.98,0,1.15,1.83,1.38,0.69,0.69,0,0,8.72,1.15,1.15,4.36,0.92,1.61,5.05,8.72,0.69,14.91,2.06,5.96,7.57,0.92,0.23,0.46,0,0,0,0.69,0,0,0.23,0.46,0,15.37,4.13,5.5,0.23,0,0,0,0,1.83,3.21,0.46,0
epfv35,I want out,"So there's me (26 F) and my partner(26F) and her kids (5yr and 7yr). We've known each other for 9 years and dated while we were younger and got together again almost two years ago.
After years of wanting each other and not being able to be together for various reasons we finally were able to be in a relationship. In the stretch between us dating and us being together, she had gotten married and had two kids. I had decided to face my CPTSD head on. As a result of medications and therapies I changed dramatically.
I think that we both got in to the relationship remembering each other as completely different people to what we are now and as a result are probably extremely poorly matched. This is apparent to me in many ways.
It wasn't long after we got together that I moved in due to my tenancy ending, her needing a new housemate and us knowing each other for years.
Things were sweet for the first few months and I could see myself with them forever. I bonded with the kids before we were a couple and my bond with them grew 10x stronger after I moved in.
I was forced by medical professionals to leave my job for a period of time to focus on my health and put on a health care plan so with me being able to spend more time at home we thought it would be a good opportunity for my partner to go back to work. I became a full time stay at home parent.
The youngest is in daycare so I get her for most of the week. The oldest has school but I usually do drop off, pick up and most of their bed times. As well as now having a job my partner also has an intense hobby that steals a lot of her time with training three or more times a week for more than three hours at a time as well as doing a gym routine and now also going for bike rides and yoga sessions. Her hobby even takes her out of state for days at a time to compete.
So I have the kids. All the time. I absolutely love it. But she has narcissistic and gaslighting tendencies, is constantly stressed to the point of yelling (She doesn't call it yelling.. It's a very loud one sided discussion) and is depressed.
I've talked to her about the way she acts and tried to help her through it and have been trying to get her in to therapy for months. She does try to make an effort at times but she always relapses by the end of the day.
So my biggest problems are:

She is hugely impacting the time I have been forced to have off to specifically treat my mental health. Some of the things she says and does will trigger my CPTSD badly which she doesn't understand and gives her more things to be mad at me about. ( why is she never allowed to be the upset one ect.( She is! All the time!))

the kids give me my will to live. They get the worst of it. They are extremely emotionaly traumatised by both parents and have ZERO support other than me. I'm constantly comforting them and soothing them when they've been attacked and I constantly catch myself making excuses for their parents behaviour and asking the 5 yr old and the 7yr old to be the ones to make the first move towards fixing things because I know that approach will be easier than convincing their parents to.

i know I need to leave. Being here is killing me, draining me, I've ended up having to bury my feelings deep inside me because even though she wants to be there for me and know everything. Every time I confide in her it somehow becomes negative and controlling. I feel so much worse coming out on the other side of those conversations. She makes me feel trapped and suffocated and like I can't do ANYTHING without her say so.

So you see my problem; I need to leave, I can't leave. If I could take the kids with me I would. That's not an option. I leave them with her and they suffer. I know childhood suffering hence my CPTSD. I feel trapped. Please help. What do I do?
TL;DR: my partner is narcissistic, mentally unstable and abusive towards me and her two children. I want out of the relationship but I'm the only one there for the kids.",basicbasss,2020-01-15 23:05:33,1,774,46,52.58,74.42,14.96,15.8,14.47,94.32,60.47,18.99,15.12,8.53,1.42,0.13,3.49,1.55,3.88,6.07,15.25,9.43,5.81,8.14,1.29,18.73,4.91,4.01,0.65,1.81,2.84,4.13,1.68,2.45,0.26,0.78,0.39,11.89,0.65,0.52,3.49,0,12.53,2.45,2.33,1.81,1.81,1.68,2.97,1.55,0.26,0.65,0.52,1.68,0.26,1.16,0,0.13,9.56,4.26,1.68,1.94,1.68,0.52,3.88,12.4,0.9,16.28,2.58,6.07,7.88,1.03,0.78,0.39,0.26,0,0.26,0.39,0,0,0.13,0.26,0,11.24,5.94,1.03,0.26,0.26,0.13,0.26,0,0,1.81,1.55,0

epq1vr,My husband has been violent three times. Last night was the worst so far.,"This is a throwaway right because I just need to talk about this and I can’t tell anyone in my life. He is on prednisone right now which pushes him to “that point” more easily. But the first time was two years ago and we argued and he threw milk in my face and I threw a plate of nachos at him and he pounced on me, strangling me and throwing me around the room. The second time we were in bed and i complained about being cold to the point that he lost it and grabbed me by my hair and threw me across the room and then declared he was kicking me out of HIS house and tried to drag me naked in a robe out into 25 degree weather. Last night was the worst. It looked to me like his pothead doless adult son who lives with us and has wrecked the car once has wrecked the car again because the banged up front was even more banged up and the car was driving funny. He as always defended the boy and said he didn’t do anything and I was making it up. I said point blank that I was a 50% partner in working and paying for everything and I begged to differ in my opinion and this is a new car we pay $300 a month for that the boy is destroying and I want him to stop using it and get his own. He started cussing me out and calling me a bitch over and over. Later I mentioned to him that I wanted him to get his will established as I had asked him three times since the fall because if something happened to him as it stands my daughters and I would lose everything to probate. He continued to cuss me out and tell me he would do what he wanted and for me to fuck off. I said I felt like he was being intentionally shady about the whole thing and that he was maybe going behind my back. This is when he lost it. He grabbed me and forced me to the door, saying I was getting the fuck out of HIS house. My young daughters saw this and started sobbing. I told him to stop and to let me go trying to free myself from him and he pushed harder, throwing me out the door so hard I hit the pavement with enough force that I got a gash on my right leg and my left and right calf torn up to the point that walking has been hard. I was sobbing and he towered over me yelling in the yard how I was being dramatic I was fine and then yelling that he was going to call the police and tell them I needed to be locked up for insanity. He made me stand up and walk back inside as painful as it was and forced me onto the couch towering over me screaming to quit crying or else I was going to get “more wrath” from him. He insisted on bandaging my wounds and mocked me for being a dramatic baby. He put a wad of petroleum jelly on my gash and I winced and said it hurt and he mocked me for this too and threatened me to remove the bandage and chastised me for not thanking him for bandaging me. I tried to post pictures of it because I just want someone to see. I don’t know how to do that on here. I’m a school teacher and I travel from room to room up and down stairs and walking has been so painful today. 

Afterward, he’s sorry. He’s so sorry. He will never do it again. But as always, it’s me who pushed his buttons. It’s all my fault. Every time. I am the one who made him, he insists. He’s sorry but...if I wasn’t so this, so that...he wouldn’t do it. He says he never hit his former two wives because he didn’t love them as much as me and their behavior didn’t set him off because he didn’t care. 

I just needed to talk here anonymously. I’m not ready to leave, call the police, tell anyone. I’m ashamed. I just feel empty and broken. I just needed to share.

epq9ej,This has never happened before to me....Need advice....,"My ex-BF (23) and I (22) broke up. We dated for 2 yrs and were absolutely not right for each other. We were both very stubborn. He was clingy and made his entire life based around mine. He hated when I hung out with my friends, or attempted to travel or do anything without him. He would get mad when I had unexpected things come up, and would constantly make me feel guilty, careless, and unorganized when we were together. He made me feel like I am lost in life and taking too long to accomplish my goals. He made fun of my mistakes and was never happy when I accomplished anything. When my work started becoming more and more demanding, he got angry and began asking that I spend more time with him. At the same time, I have been taking care of my mother who recently became sick and was not able to do much on her own. I was not able to spend much time with him since it is not an option, and after some time I was finally able to break up with him. I tried before but he resisted many times and made me feel really guilty and I did not know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was taking my stuff to leave, I had asked him to delete somethings off his phone that related to our relationship and he claimed he did but I did not believe so I asked to see the phone. He became very flustered and started getting angry and calling me names, which further indicated that he was lying. I said I wouldn't leave until he showed me the phone but he continued to refuse and told me since we are not dating anymore he is not afraid to put his hands on me. and he did. He tried to throw me out of the way and held me down. He tried to pull out everything he could possibly say to hurt me everything from calling me fat to saying I was stupid to insulting my goals and my family and religion. I grew up with aggressive brothers and have also got like 20lbs on him, so naturally, I fought back. This then turned into a fight of us pushing and tackling each other and he held me down at one point and spit in my face. He put both of his hands on my mouth to shut me up. This happened two days ago, my body has begun to settle down and I feel all of the aches all over my body. I feel the pain, I see the scratches and bruises. I have never seen this unchecked temper side of him, and I am still in shock over what happened. It won't fucking leave my mind. I feel the pain when I move my arms, turn my neck, sit or stand, my jaw hurts, and the worst of all is I cannot get the images out of my mind. I can't stop seeing episodic views of this occurrence. It affects my moods and emotions. I am not in a location where therapy or meds or legal actions are available. 

How do I deal with the pain and just the horrific memory of this event? I just want this pain and feeling to go away so I can focus on what is truly important to me.",Vivid-Awareness,2020-01-16 13:52:02,12,579,22.33,27.86,88.88,1,18.09,11.05,94.82,60.79,23.14,18.31,11.74,1.04,0,5.53,0,4.84,2.59,13.82,7.6,5.01,9.33,2.94,20.73,4.15,2.07,2.42,0.86,2.59,6.39,0.86,5.18,0.52,2.25,0.69,11.92,0.52,0.35,0.35,5.53,12.26,2.42,1.73,1.21,1.9,1.9,3.97,5.18,1.21,1.04,2.94,3.63,1.9,1.73,0.17,0.17,8.29,2.07,2.07,2.42,1.73,0.35,8.64,8.98,0.35,16.93,2.76,7.43,6.74,1.04,0.52,0.17,0.35,0.17,0,0.35,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,11.92,6.56,3.11,0,0.35,0.17,0,0.17,0,0.52,0.69,0.35
epqjim,"As a friend, I don’t know what to do","Ok so my best friend has been dating her boyfriend for nearly eight years. She’s wonderful! Despite being abused in her childhood, she has a big heart willing to love and help anyone in an instant. Her boyfriend? She started dating him right after he got out of jail for being a sex offender. He just so happens to have ASD so I don’t know if I’m just shaming him by posting this or not. Or if that has anything to do with why he treats my bestie like shit. Anyway. He has yelled at her and thrown things in front of her...she ran out but accepted his embrace and his “I’m sorry, I love you, I won’t do it again.” He’s yelled at her for other things too and supposedly his exes broke up with him due to his temper. But mine stayed with him because she’ll do anything for him and I can’t understand why. He has no ambition...he’s in his 40’s, living with parents still. When he didn’t have a job, my friend GAVE him $2000+ worth of money to get his name off the list; he wasn’t taken off it of course and spent most of it on computer ware. When she wanted to stop paying for him, he threatened suicide (which I would normally take more seriously, if he wasn’t being so petty). Thankfully he found a job and swore to pay her back...but instead, it has gone to his own self-interests aka a car and anything else besides paying her off. She wants to get married and have children with him but doesn’t want to ask anymore because it upsets him. When asked why he hasn’t proposed he said because he doesn’t get paid enough or that he would need to sell all his action figures, or that he wants to move out of state first, or that he doesn’t know yet. Now? His parents are taking about moving to New Mexico. He said he wants to stay in state for a few years so he can work (which is landscaping that ends late in the night, a fact that used to upset her), but when asked, he said to prepare for the worst because he doesn’t know how she sees him in her future. I don’t know if I should tell her what she wants to hear (which is what I’ve been doing so far) or tell her the actual truth (which I know will make her push me away). Many have told her to break up with him...she chose him above all else. Despite the fact he was deliberately checking out other women, and even ME (my underwear was exposed and my boyfriend was the one who caught that).  Is this all abuse? My friend doesn’t want to do couples therapy because she “doesn’t need it,” and fears they might want her to accept his temper tantrums. Do I just have high expectations? I want to be a “good friend,” but as someone with bipolar 1 and anxiety I’m not sure how to be so in this type of situation. Why...just why does he stay with her, if it is abuse? Is his illness to blame?

epr9pu,Did my ex boyfriend sexually assault me?,"Sorry for this long post - I still cannot get my head around my first relationship I was in from age 17-22 or so, and whether he abused me or not. We were on and off until I was 18 and then we were ‘steady’. I was so naive and insecure (and still quite insecure) and he was the first ever guy to show an interest in me. So I was head over heels and wanted to do pretty much anything to please him. 

So anyway. The first thing I think of is when we were brand new to getting to know each other. We were about a month in and he said he didn’t want a relationship. I was heartbroken. We kept texting and he kept being flirty. Eventually he asked if we could be ‘friends with benefits’ (both of us were virgins). I had made it clear to him before that I didn’t want to have sex unless we were in a committed relationship (he was always flirting and known for being quite desperate at school). Unfortunately I was so so into him I considered it and he was like ‘out of everyone I would like it to be with you the most’. 

So I fell for it and agreed. We organised for me to go to his house in the middle of the day. We got to his room. He tried straight away. As I was so inexperienced I panicked. I told him I wasn’t ready and couldn’t do it. He and his dad drove me home. I thought we would just stay friends. He then texted that I had completely lead him on, teased him and that I made him feel horrible. He said he wish he had chosen one of the other girls he had asked to be fuck buddies with. He deleted me on Facebook and ignored me for six months. 

Six months on he added me again. We made up. We were on and off again, he would go off with other girls and then come back, etc etc. 

Finally we were steady as we finished school. We were 18, summer approaching and going into uni. This is when I think the serious abuse happened. But then I wonder if because I dislike him so much that maybe I blow it out of proportion. I was not good mentally at all. I had major depression and anxiety. We both picked unis and they were about an hour train away. So we were happy to do long distance.

As I was so depressed, I feel like I almost abused him, again something I struggle to understand if I was just asking for what I needed or if I was manipulative. I had no family near by and he was my lifeline when I was suicidal. He didn’t break up with me, but sometimes would refuse to talk me on the phone if I was having a breakdown/sobbing because I was taking away from his uni experience. He did used to visit me almost every weekend. I used to sob down the phone and beg him to look after me. So I do feel bad for putting him in that position.

Now I don’t know if maybe because he was ‘there for me’ that he thought I owed him whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. I did have a high sex drive at the start of our relationship once he committed. However as time went on it lessened. This became a huge problem for him. 

I remember three specific times. The first was when I was visiting him for the weekend, and he met me at the train station. I was feeling really unwell, quite faint and weak and nauseous. He insisted on looking at the shops, walked 4 metres in front of me the whole time. Finally convinced him to go to his flat, which was about a 30 min walk. We finally made it home. We got into bed and I just wanted to rest. He got horny. He tried to initiate and I told him I wasn’t well. I can’t remember how he managed to do it but eventually he got me to give him a handjob. I remember sobbing and wanking him off until he finished. I don’t remember what I did after he cummed. We didn’t have sex but I just remember the sobbing. 

The second was when we went to bed one night, maybe before an early morning to go away. He got horny, I wasn’t at all. I told him I wasn’t and I was tired, we had to wake up early the next day. He told me ‘just try’. He kissed me and I kissed back. Eventually he kept saying ‘just let me try and make you horny’ so I said fine. He fingered me and I just lay there totally uninterested. He then got angry and me ‘you aren’t even trying’ he told me. Again I can’t remember how the conversation ended but I think we went to sleep angry at each other. 

The third I remember we were sleeping in the morning and again maybe it didn’t even happen but I was laying on my back. He moved positions in his sleep and while he did so he ran his hand up my crotch so casually and then let go. I was so sleepy but I remember just feeling uncomfortable and went straight back to sleep. I didn’t think much of it at the time. 

At the end of our relationship, I had lost any sexual attraction to him for the last six months and he knew it. He tried buying me gifts and telling me sweet compliments (which he hadn’t really done when I was sexually attracted to him). I was so scared of losing him and saw him as my safety blanket. He said that sex was important to him and of course co-erced me into intercourse a few times. He finally ended it and it took me a long time to realise what our relationship had been - toxic. 

Side notes: throughout he would insult my looks like saying I had a big head, hairy ‘troll’ feet, big ears etc. But he had done it jokingly and came across as ‘banter’ but I do think it effected my confidence. 

So again sorry for the wall of text - was I abused? Or was I just confused at the time and maybe I am blowing it out of proportion? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated! 

TLDR: felt forced into sexual acts a few times but he never held me down and forced me himself. Is that abuse?",lunamoon1994,2020-01-16 15:01:32,0,1121,12.94,56.03,67.53,8.65,13.51,12.13,95.63,64.05,24.09,20.34,9.99,2.5,0.27,7.49,0.09,3.75,3.66,12.58,9.63,7.14,10.17,1.96,21.5,4.01,1.34,1.43,1.69,1.52,5.62,2.05,3.48,0.89,0.98,0.98,14.9,0.18,0.45,0.18,7.76,13.11,2.85,1.69,2.05,2.85,1.25,4.01,2.32,0.54,0.8,0.8,3.21,1.69,0.45,1.25,0.09,9.55,4.55,1.34,2.41,1.34,0.36,13.2,5.35,1.07,16.41,2.23,7.14,7.31,0.54,0.45,0.62,0.27,0,0.09,0.54,0.18,0.09,0,0.09,0.09,13.56,6.96,1.61,0.18,0,0.36,0.09,0.45,0.8,2.32,0.71,0.09

My dad was physically and verbally abusive when i was a child and after years of enduring it i finally decided  to tell my mum because he had started to hit my younger sister as well. After telling her, my mum went into denial i’m assuming and said he was doing it because he loved and cared for me and my sister? She later told me it was our fault that he hit us because of how annoying we were. It was hard. Eventually she confronted him and instead of bettering himself, he manipulated the situation and turned the blame on me and my sister- sayinf we were evil and awful for ever telling our mum. 4 years later he has kind of improved, we don’t see him much and when we do we don’t really communicate with him. Instead, my mother has become verbally abusive, unreasonable and cruel. Swearing at me calling me useless and disgusting. Every day i cry myself to sleep. I’ve suffered from depression for years but never had the chance to get therapy because i know my parents will deny i actually have a problem and will just say i’m exaggerating.

epth28,I was in an abusive relationship that really did damage,"I'm posting the shorter version, because I'm tired of going over it over and over in my head. For starters, I'm male and my ex was female, just for a little background. We both have problems, but there is a twist at the end.

Now, we had been together for six years, we were each other's first, and met on a now-defunct forum for people with issues (yes, we both had some damage and frankly that's how we bonded). For a while, it was going well. We weren't rich, but we were doing okay, then her issues started popping up (extreme paranoia and delusions) and we needed to leave my family and move near her sister in a state in which we had no other connections. While it was difficult, I was in love and considered that a change in atmosphere would be good. Well, he problems got worse, even going so far as accusing her sister of harassing her and pretending she was never abused.

Eventually we moved into a junky apartment, where things got worse. She would get verbally violent, repeat herself to try and convince me of things, drink heavily, and then the next day apologize. I don't go through phones, but it became clear I wasn't the only guy she was talking to, and after two-ish years, she ran off to live with her mother because, ""It's what's best for us!"" After bragging through text about her hookups, eventually she wanted to get back together. I was emotionally vulnerable enough to agree, and when she came back we did fine for a while.

Fine, until she played on my depression and pushed me into staying home from work often while provided less support over time. Her reason I learned before she left again was that she wanted ""to be more in charge of us."" However, depression tends to snowball, even with medical support, and she thrived off of this. On occasion she went to visit her sister, which was fine, until I noticed that the odometer wasn't adding up with how far her sister was. Some of the days she must have drove to her sister's house and back ten times in a row. My ex brushed it off. 

Once again, it took time, but eventually she got worse and it ended up in a hospitalization. I talked to her sister more and we learned quite a bit that my ex had compartmentalized. The lies were adding up, she wasn't abused but rather she had always craved attention, and in fact her upbringing was pretty comfortable. I went to visit once with her sister, and while she hugged me she acted as though I wasn't there, I wasn't in her future plans. A week later she apologized, and life went on.

A lot had piled up in my life, and her decision to sleep in another room got to me and I ended up in a hospital. Even in the ten minutes a day I had on the phone she was talking about maybe just ending things, but maybe not. I was being strung along, but didn't have the willpower to see it. Two weeks after I got out, and she had been acting nicer, I received a text while she was over her sister's that she was breaking up, because it was best for her. I packed her things in a rage, taking only an hour (very fast, seeing as how much she spent and how little she had) and then she tried to guilt me into feeling like the villain using all the tropes. Of course she admitted to cheating as well, but only to ""help me move on.""

It wasn't until two months later, after missing her, that I had that realization. Everything she had done, every red flag I had ignored, every time she tested the waters to see how far she could push things, it was textbook abusive. I was blind to it all. Like most abuse, the damage was a slow build over time until it was normal for me. My trust issues were already serious, but now they had become permanent, I don't even trust myself anymore.

There are times when, even now, I find myself feeling like I was responsible for everything, and I struggle to get out of that mindset until I have some clarity and remember that while I wasn't perfect, I didn't do this to myself. I may have let her, but at the same time, I was powerless to notice. It's taken me 8 months to be able to have even the slightest bit of trust in strangers, such as cashiers, but I still have trouble around women. It's irrational, but a part of me now.

So I don’t know what to call it, so I’ll just say I’m (19f) dating a man (30m) rn. We’ve been talking everyday for a bit now and we just went on our first date 2 days ago. 

We went out for dinner at my favorite pub and then we went to his place and talked and fooled around. And.. I’ve never felt like that before in my life. The way he’d look at me made me feel so sexy and attractive. The way he’d kiss me... and then in between being active, we’d just lay together and talk and joke and he’d touch and caress all these different parts of my body so softly and gingerly. It was so amazing it felt like a dream. Not only am I physically attracted to him but I’m also attracted to who he is, his personality n such. From the first day we started talking, he would listen to me. He listened to some of my honest confessions of some of my abuse. He’d listen to things I’d like to talk about and he hasn’t judge me for anything. And I love hearing him talk about himself and interests too. He’s so kind and caring and he makes me giggle and laugh. 

But... he scares me and makes me anxious. Or the possibility/idea of being with him does. See, I have a past of sexual abuse and manipulation with most of my relationships. I would date or get involved with men my age through the years and they’d manipulate my feelings just to try and get sex from me. Some of the few good ones just didn’t really pay attention to me, they rather just seemed to be infatuated with the idea of having a girlfriend who likes them and never tried to get to know me. And they, too, quickly focused on nothing but trying to have sex with me. 

Being with this guy (30m)... it’s so amazing it feels like I’m finally breathing. But it’s so foreign and weird because I’m so accustomed to being used. So it’s frightening to me. 

Surprisingly, I actually feel like I can talk to him and bear my soul to him. We’ve been so honest with each other and have been very early on from talking. I wanna talk to him, tell him my fears and how I want to try and ask if he could be patient with me if he does want to date me, but I’m scared it will only drive him away.... which is crazy cause I’ve already talked to him about my abuse a bit. Plus, I asked him where we stand a while ago and he said “more than Fwb but not a full blown relationship”, so that means he does care for me and is interested in me....

I know I should just talk to him, but I’m only seeing advice because I need to hear outside opinions and my anxiety and trauma holds me back sometimes... plus it’s so early that I don’t wanna something now and ruin my chances...

I just... really kinda like him and it seems maybe he’d be able to handle me with all the damage I have due to the abuse I’ve endured most of my life. I’ve never felt so free and safe like this before but I’m so scared of how it feels because I’m not used to it and I’m also scared to be too forward and ruin my chances with him",Suburban-Mouse,2020-01-16 20:07:49,14,613,7.34,44.82,49.21,31.33,16.13,10.11,96.08,65.25,23.33,18.6,11.26,1.47,0,5.22,0.65,4.73,3.1,14.19,11.42,8.97,13.05,1.79,19.9,5.06,2.45,1.14,0.49,2.12,7.83,4.08,3.75,1.31,0.82,0.49,14.36,0,1.14,0,5.87,14.68,3.1,2.12,1.96,3.59,1.31,4.08,3.59,0.49,1.31,1.79,1.96,0.33,0.49,0.82,0.16,6.04,2.94,1.14,0.65,1.14,0.16,5.22,13.21,0.98,9.62,0.98,3.43,5.87,0.16,0.49,0,0.33,0.33,0,0.82,0,0.49,0,0,0,19.09,9.46,2.28,0,0,0,0,0,0.33,5.87,0.98,0.16

epw7m0,How to approach a toxic mom,"My mother has always had toxic tendencies but she does have some redeeming qualities. I don’t remember her being as toxic as she is now... most of her toxic behavior started after she found out my dad was looking at porn and had fake social media accounts where he would try to hook up with woman... she’s still with him and they’re going to marriage counseling but my dad doesn’t admit he has a problem. I’ve watched this destroy my mom over the years.. she already had PPD for years and now she’s adding to that depression.

Anyways.. after she found out all this stuff about my dad she’s been slowly self destructing, but she refuses to leave him...the toxic behavior started out small like her having small outbursts of anger where she’ll throw everything in front of her.. or sweep everything off the counter while yelling angrily. The toxic behavior started to grow but it turned into nasty insults.. I have health issues and when I was 10-14 they were super bad. I had an issue where I frequently needed to go to the bathroom.. my mom then made this nasty comment: “Why don’t you just wear a diaper so you’ll stop being in the bathroom when I need to use it.” She always said how I could hold it (I couldn’t.. I would almost pee myself). Of course I was very upset about this but held it in... I didn’t have too many friends because I was a victim of bullying. It crushed me especially when the only friend I had left from my church abandoned me to be with the group who was bullying me.

I told my mom about this.. I was crushed and my mom dead ass told me that all friends suck and I should just try better to fit in... I was devastated. She also made all of us be homeschooled so I was limited on who I could talk to. I met some awesome people after being enrolled in cyber school. Don’t get me wrong I loved my bff from cyber school, but I needed that physical connection.. I craved for it.. My sister ended up convincing me to go to the party (I never go out cause of the anxiety caused by bullying) ... and my mother was really toxic to my sis thinking she was a hoe and just wanted me to go so she could have an excuse to go to the party and hook up with guys.. the truth was I told my sister how lonely I was and that some nights I just wanted to die... she saw this as a chance to make new friends and wanted to help me out.. well my mom started to question me on why I wanted to go and when I repeated that she said to me, “Aren’t your little cyber friends enough for you” in such a toxic tone.. I was at my limit and .. well yeah I had a panic attack and cried excessively and started pulling my own hair out from the stress. My mom saw this as I was “guilty” and made me go to her room where she was trying to falsely punish my sister and in. When I politely told her that I cried cause of her comment, she played the victim and ran out crying.

Her toxic behavior got so bad that when I was telling her I needed counseling (I tried to commit suicide and finally saw I needed help...) she told me I was just over reacting and just said I have depression an anxiety cause it was a trend... flash forward to recently ... I was in a car wreck 6 months ago and I’m still in recovery. I was rear ended by an 18 wheeler and I have been in horrible pain and my movement is impaired. Yesterday.. after experiencing this pain and isolated life again (out of work and school) she had the audacity to say, “Your accident has been way harder on me than on you cause I take you to your appointments and I’m not getting anything out of it!” I told her I’d get her some money for helping me and then she declined it.. saying she didn’t need money... flash forward to today she literally threw a fit over me not letting her have a french fry.. I offered to buy her one but she kept saying no and even starting yelling that I was bothering her.. when I politely reminded her of that she got so angry she said some testy words to me and then stormed upstairs and slammed her door like a child... I was able to compose myself even though I had excessive stress and felt like I was gonna have a mental break down... My dad than started to scold me how I was a brat and I should have just gave her one even tho I paid for the fries and asked her numerous time if she wanted me to buy her some... after he yelled at me I finally went to my room to have my mental break down... I’m also breaking down again now I’ve been so stressed I’ve been sick to my stomach and ... well TMI but my poop has blood in it that’s how stressed I am... I don’t want my mom to go down this road of no recovery.. but I don’t know how to confront her without her playing the victim...",Kawaii_Dragon_Senpai,2020-01-16 21:45:00,2,925,20.39,46.97,57.68,1,17.13,12.54,93.73,61.19,22.7,18.92,12.11,0.11,0.86,5.73,0.11,3.78,3.89,13.41,10.05,7.03,8.32,1.73,20.76,3.35,1.95,2.27,0.65,1.41,6.59,1.62,4.97,1.08,1.51,1.19,14.7,2.05,0.76,6.81,1.08,10.27,0.97,2.16,2.38,1.73,1.19,2.27,2.16,0.54,1.08,0.43,2.7,0.65,1.62,0.11,0.22,7.24,2.16,1.3,2.59,0.97,0.54,10.81,7.78,0.76,14.92,3.03,6.38,5.84,0.76,0.65,0.65,0.65,0.11,0.32,1.41,0.32,0.32,0.22,0.32,0.11,16.76,11.57,0.54,0.11,0,0,0.11,0.11,0.86,2.59,0.86,0
epx0kf,How can I suspect if someone is suffering any effects from abuse/an unstable enivornment?,"Don't have to read this big middle part, just looking for any answers to my essential question at the bottom.

A family member of mine has lived with their grandmother for around 20 years, I believe. She has Alzheimer's and I know she can at times be loud, quite erratic and just irritating. I don't how hard it is for them to live with her on a psychological level, or if they're really still okay with it at this point. They know at some point they're gonna have to get her into a retirement home, but I have no idea when that's actually gonna happen. As far I can see, their financial situation is good and life is decent and seemingly quite comfortable. I don't know what it might be like if an argument ever gets heated over there, but I wouldn't think it'd be too bad. They get frustrated with each other enough, I know that. They still love each other and all but I'm a little afraid of the grandmother ending up putting a real hit to my family member's mental/emotional energy or the physical space they live in. I know well that households can secretly really suck behind closed doors at any degree and I don't get to spend a ton of time there. I just want to make sure my family member isn't taking terrible abuse without avoiding/healing from it if I could potentially help it at all, even if only sometimes.

from that our relationship turned to hell.

she’d call me in sick at work whenever she wanted something to fuck. she stopped me from seeing my friends. she spent my money on herself. she’d hit me whenever i tried to stand up for myself.

she got wasted one night. came home with some guy. they fucked on the couch. the next week she starts sobbing and hugging my legs saying if i ever left or cheated that shed kill herself.

she punched me and broke my goddamn nose when i brought my sisters cat home to petsit while she went out of state for work. she told me if i told anyone what she had done she’d cut the cats head off and send it to my sister. i gave the cat to my brother. 

i called her a crazy bitch after a night of drinking. heated argument came. i hit her this time... she called me abusive and said if i ever lay a finger on her again, she’d get my ass thrown in jail. 

she got me fired from my job for calling in sick too much. 

insulted my father (who is an ex military officer) about his trauma he had faced 10 years ago. threw a shit ton of homophobic slurs to my gay brother at his wedding.

dead.

eq6h11,when yelling/door-slamming becomes more than just verbal/emotional abuse and actually is PHYSICAL abuse too?,"This happens so often I feel like in addition to the stress I have at someone doing this (ie the stress of an accidental door slam, you think something might be wrong) to the stress at someone doing this intentionally/unnecessarily (ie they actually are mad, or are actually trying to upset me by doing it) it's sometimes so loud I wonder about possible hearing damage...

That and playing the TV extremely loud, or turning up amplifier on electric instruments. It seems to be done when I am in the proximity, and in combination with yelling / door-slamming it just feels targeted, and I feel like maybe I might actually lose hearing sensitivity as a result of it...

There is also the issue of sleep because the slamming door wakes me up when someone is coming/going on a different sleep schedule than me. This is even more alarming than when slamming happens when I am awake because I panic and have no idea what is going on.",ClawfootHilda,2020-01-17 13:05:02,7,185,29.11,22.46,92.7,1,30.83,22.7,88.65,61.62,15.14,7.03,5.95,0,0.54,0,0.54,8.11,5.41,14.05,11.35,11.35,9.73,0.54,20,5.95,4.86,3.24,0,1.08,8.65,0.54,8.11,3.24,2.7,0.54,3.78,0,0,0,0,18.38,4.32,2.16,0,8.11,0.54,5.41,4.86,0,3.24,1.62,1.62,1.08,0.54,0,0,3.24,0,1.08,1.08,0,1.62,0.54,12.97,2.7,14.05,1.62,8.11,4.32,0.54,1.08,2.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.59,4.86,2.7,0,0,0.54,0,1.08,0,0.54,2.16,2.7
eq92ia,What kind of abuse is this?,"When I was around five or six years old, I learned how to masturbate. I’m not sure how my mom found out, but she did. She began having these talks with me where she told me that what I was doing was sexual immorality and it’s the same as pre-marital sex or adultery, that it was an abomination to God. Then she transitioned into telling me that it was a disorder. She actually took me to the doctor and I remember the exact words she said. She said, “Show the doctor what you do.” I had to fake masturbate in front of the doctor. Then she blackmailed me saying, “If you don’t do what I say, I can embarrass you very badly.” She said that my dad or sister didn’t know about it but she could tell them at any time. Sometimes, if she got suspicious or if I had been spending a lot of time in my room, she would come in and sit me down on my bed and ask if I had been doing my “habit.” She called it my “habit,” never using its proper name or educating me about what it was. She was borderline obsessed with checking if I was doing it. She also told our neighbor about it. I never knew that other people did it or that it was normal. It wasn’t until I was fourteen that I opened up about it to my therapist, talking about how I had a disease and I was going to hell, that she told me it was normal and most people do it. She educated me on what it was and convinced me there wasn’t anything wrong with me. In addition to this, my mom would walk around naked a lot, pee with the door open, and bathe with the door open.",macnche3s3,2020-01-17 16:22:01,0,312,4.4,33.83,69.37,2.7,17.33,9.94,95.19,67.31,29.49,18.27,11.22,0.32,0.96,5.45,0.32,11.22,3.85,10.9,12.5,5.77,9.62,2.24,21.79,2.56,0.96,3.53,0.96,1.28,3.21,0.32,2.88,0.96,0.64,0,14.42,1.28,0.32,6.41,0.32,14.42,2.24,1.28,2.56,6.09,1.28,6.09,1.92,0.32,1.6,0,3.53,0.64,1.6,1.6,0,3.85,0.96,0,1.92,0.64,0.32,12.18,5.77,0.96,12.5,0.96,7.69,3.85,1.28,0.32,1.92,0.32,0.96,0,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0,15.06,5.45,4.49,0,0,0.32,0,0.32,2.56,1.92,0,0
eqa0nk,Questions about abuse,"Hi so my family's been going through a lot of shit recently. There is my stepsister, my oldest brother, me, the twins, than my youngest sister. My paternal grandfather (dads dad) recently passed my family not really being close to him went to the funeral out of respect for my dad. Now we weren't close bc he use to sexually abuse his kids and we later found out his grandkids as well. We felt bad about not being close so my younger sister (24) stayed to get closer to them ened up getting  raped by my cousin in the living room where all my aunts and uncles were. Yes we went to the police and got a SARS kit. So since than said sister hasn't been the same and rightfully so. With all this happening its brought up a lot of trauma from our past like my moms emotional abuse as well as our fathers physical abuse. She is now claiming my father sexually abused  not only her but me and my older stepsister. My stepsister also claims my father tried to with her. I have no recollection of said events or all of my childhood. So later on that month her twin, our brother got her drunk and claimed to have sex with her. Shes claiming rape and I believe her. However this has caused him to lose his daughter which I agree with his ex wife is the wise move. So my father is living with him in his apartment. My sister cut off everyone due to them questioning her and asking if it really happened, except me and my oldest brother. Now just for clarification we knew my dad did something to said sister since middle school but we only knew he kissed her she only recently said it was more. So we've had all this time to deal with this information I still talk to my dad. Mostly bc idk if he did abuse me or not. But my moms been playing the victim and mentally abusing me bc I refuse to let my kids be around my dad so I'm no longer talking to her. But despite everything my family was always close it's so hard to not talk to them I want to call my mom every day and forget everything but I know it wont solve anything so where do I go from here I only have my sister(24) to talk to. I miss my family I miss talking to my mom I miss going to her house to get away from my mother in law.

eqa4v5,A glimpse of my early school years,"My name is Tav, 21 y/o. 
This is a story that happen back when i was in 4th grade and living in Kuwait: I had this arabic teacher who used to come to class just to sit in the chair and do absolutely nothing at all till the bell rings. One day a supervisor came in for a visit and my teacher immediately started doing his job because he basically doesn't want to get fired if ever seen sitting on a  chair and do nothing except checking phone and smoke cigarettes (this was the first time seeing this ""teacher"" actually doing his job) . 
So at the end of the class, the teacher started asking questions about the stuff he just explained and one of the questions was shot towards me, i couldn't answer it because it was the last class of the day and i was out of focus, which made the teacher ""look bad"" from the supervisor's perspective (as if no one undertood what he said) . 
Minutes later and the bell rang, everyone wraped up their stuff and just left, then that teacher asked me not to leave because he want to have a ""talk"" with me. 
So i waited for everyone to leave to see whats up. The teacher came up to me and said ""You failed to answer my question, but we never talked about a punishment"" . And out of his bag, he brings this metal 50 cm ruler ad started monstrously hitting me really hard on my hands that he broke a finger and i got so many bruses on my body, my reaction was nothing except me standing still while getting hit, crying and begging him to stop. 
The next things he does is that he said: ""If you fail to answer next time, it's gonna be harder"" and left me to leave. 
My body was in so much pain that i can still remember how it felt 10 years later. I grabbed some tree leaves and wrapped em around my broken finger with some duct tape i had in my bag.
So i waited for my dad to arrive and as soon as i saw him, i told him that ""i got punished for not answering a question correctly"" and he didn't even ask what the punishment was , he didn't care at all, and no one noticed that i had a broken finger or bruses all over my body for 2 months.",TavStruggles,2020-01-17 17:52:34,1,416,40.61,35.9,76.02,4.18,32,12.74,92.07,58.65,18.99,12.74,7.93,0.24,0.48,3.85,0.24,6.25,6.25,13.46,6.73,6.01,9.38,2.88,19.23,2.88,1.44,1.44,2.16,1.68,2.64,0.24,2.4,0,0.72,0.96,9.62,0.24,0,0,4.09,12.02,3.12,1.68,1.44,2.4,2.88,3.12,4.81,1.2,1.44,2.16,2.64,1.68,0.72,0,0.48,6.73,0.24,0.72,4.81,0.96,0.96,9.38,6.73,0.72,16.35,2.64,6.01,7.93,4.57,0,0,0.24,0,0,0.96,0,0.72,0.24,0,0,12.26,2.88,3.37,0.48,0,0,0,0,2.88,1.44,0.96,0.24
eqadu0,Does this count as abuse? Not sure how to feel,"When I was around 10 (f) my mom would babysit a girl for her friend. She was about 16 (f) at the time. 

I considered us friends and never noticed the age gap. We used to play video games together a lot and generally had fun when she stayed over.

Now one thing I remember happening sometimes is that we'd play this game where we'd get totally naked and do poses and dances. Then she would record it on this little video camera I had. It was my camera and she never took it home so the footage never left my house, as far I remember she would record me then delete it. 

I don't recall anything happening other than that, it was just me taking my clothes off and prancing about my room.

For those of you who would like a cup of sweet drama tea; get those tea cups ready and your crakers opened, this is gunna be a loooong story.

So, two years ago i started dating my now fiance. The only family i had met at that time was his grandfather and grandmother because he lived with them. They were sweet people, to a point that is. But thats all people right? 
Anyways, a few months into the relationship it seems as though he had huge issues growing up, as well as he didn't exactly know how to act as a person let alone in a relationship, for example: if we argued he'd shut down and say nothing to me and withhold everything. I decided to help him instead of leave him. It became apparent he literally didn't know right from wrong, which was odd. As i got to know him i learned his mother had him and almost gave him up. But her mother (his grandmother) told her to keep him. She did. At age of 3 was taken from his home because his mother and her new boyfriend were caught with meth. (they were also involved in very many issues with domestic violence and were and still are violent drunks. We are getting there tho). He was put in foster care and by the time his grandparents got him back from the system, he weighted 15 lbs because the foster family abused him, he was only 3 and a half. At four His grandparents against all better judgement gave him back to his mother and her boyfriend. Then for 9 years of his life he had to deal with constant fighting, yelling, and seeing things a child shouldn't see. They'd leave porno magazines all over the house, wouldn't close their door when doing shit. And even cheated on each other with other people in front of him. They'd brawl out on eachother and other people, and after his mother was beaten she would tell my boyfriend to keep quiet and that she didn't want the guy to go to jail. Would have fist fights and one time the boyfriend pushed his mother into a wall and caused a huge hole in it. After all the abuse at 13 he called dhs. They put him in his grandparents custody. 

Skip to our relationship four years later. I meet his mom. She's fake as fuck and pretends to like me. Comments on how cute i am etc. Its all meh whatever. I soon realize shes still the drunk my boyfriend explained her to be all those years ago. Shes still with the same guy. And they're toxic. Me and my boyfriend get pregnant a little bit into the relationship on accident. She tries to claim it isnt his. I know very well its his. As well as he does too. The whole pregnancy his mother and his grandmother basically abused us mentally and his grandmother caused us severe sleep deprivation. Skip to after pregnancy the day i have my son. She shows up in the toom randomly like 20 minutes after having my kid. I didnt invite her. Nor could i understand what was going on since i was drugged and just popped a baby out. She became possessive over my son within seconds of the nurses taking him and cleaning him up. She finally left after a while. But came back that same night drunk. She told my boyfriend he n e e d e d to go with her home because she wanted mom and son time. He told her he wasn't going to just leave me alone with our 13 hour old son. Eventually it got to the point where he threatened security. She told him he didn't love her and that he was being fucked up. We shrugged it off. My boyfriends mothers husband/boyfriend thing, wanted to meet my son. So i tried to be nice and take him over there. I requested that they dont have the dogs or cats out because my son was 2 days old, as well as no one be drinking. Well, when we got there they smelled heavily of beer but tried to convince us they didn't drink for three days and like that was an accomplishment. I take my son out and let them hold him. But then my boyfriends mother asks for a beer which her husband/boyfriend thing goes and gets. Shes holding my son, so i asked that she not drink. She opens the bottle and drinks it over my son. Irritated i ask for him back. She refuses. I ask about three more times, to which my boyfriend gets up and has to go take him from her.i promptly put my son in his car seat and leave. I don't allow her to see my son after this. At about 4 days old my son is taken to the ER because he is having seizures. He is in Doernbechers for 9 days(in this time i gave my mother custody of my son because my boyfriends mother was a threat to his safety and i didnt want him taken from me) To which his family harasses me and tells me its all my fault that he has seizures. After he is out we have him on meds and stuff. I didnt want anyone coming over yet because my tiny baby was having seizures and i was overwhelmed. We had to move out from my mothers house and we moved into his grandparents house. They treated us awfully and expected us to do shit for them when all his grandmother did was run around screaming and yelling and harrassing us both. We moved out and went to his mothers. She said she changed. We gave her a chance. For 5 months they drank incessantly, and abused us and my boyfriend was physically harmed by the mothers boyfriend. I have pictures to prove. In this time his mother threatened to kill me. Beat me. And mentally and emotionally abused us both. Would tell my boyfriend to leave me and such. This caused tensions to raise in my relationship causing him and i to have huge arguments. And i really do blame his mother and her husband/boyfriend thing for almost ruining my relationship. Anyways, we move back with my mom and my son in Oct of 2019. Havent taked to her since. My boyfriend occasionally goes over there but for very short periods of time. One day we get a missed call and it's from his mother. She leaves a raunchy voicemail saying im a cunt and a bitch and that i control my boyfriend. He calls her from a different phone asking wtf her problem was. She yells that ive ruined his life. He says he is having the time of his life and she doesn't know what he means. She then starts yelling obscenities about shit. Shes drunk. She tells him she had ""ways to deal with cozy (me) accordingly"" but She then says these words ""if you come back to me. I'll help you get custody of your son."" Right after saying that she doesnt think its his son. (This is exactly why my mother has custody) My mom chimes in with ""good luck seeing as he is in my custody"" and his mother goes off saying shes going to ""pull up"" on my house and beat my mom. Calls her a cunt and a bitch. Then tells my mom to wait 20 minutes and shed ""pull up"" it never happens

It is now 3 or 4 days since she called and threatened me and my mother, and the saftey of the other children in this house.

eqbah8,No idea what the problem is... But I can feel there is a problem.,"So, my little half sister, who I don't actually think is genetically related to me but that's another story...

And there is just something WRONG in that household. I have no idea what it is. Like, none at all! 

I don't really know where to begin or how to describe it. One red flag to me is how hard she studies. She gets all the top grades. When asked about why she studies so hard she says it's because life can get so unfair. I recognise it is a normal upper middle class behaviour to study hard but it takes the piss a bit. I also wonder if this is how she intends to get out of her current predicament.

I notice she fills her time with so much socialising she never has the chance to be at home and her mother was disgustingly abusive to my father when he had arthritis. Like really cruel. 

But there are no outward signs. She dresses normally, often provokingly even. Like a normal girl her age. They say sexual abuse victims cover up a great deal. No bruises or anthing although my father who was a severe alcoholic at the end of his life misspoke and said her mother had broken her arm once. He was bad enough to make huge errors in speech but I don't know. 

I had a feeling dealing with her of trying to break through impenetrable glass and have often felt that I am being manipulated. Normally it might be funny that a girl so young (16) is successfully doing so but it leads me to wonder if there is something inside she is hiding.

Live in the UK in relation to answers... Laws etc.

I wonder if anyone has anything to contribute? I think I am doing well with her in all that I can do, which is basically nothing. I converse with her a bit.

eqdjma,"19M and 17F, Girlfriend's mother seems to be abusive and toxic towards her, need advice on what to do?","She lives with her mother, who had an extremely rough and traumatic childhood. Despite that, her mother’s become extremely successful, and after a couple of failed marriages and relationships, she is raising my girl on her own. The problem is I'm pretty sure her mother is emotionally abusive towards her, she’s a functioning alcoholic who persistently berates her daughter and calls her a horrible person to “keep her humble”, expects her to grow up and become autonomous yet continues to crush any of her attempts to actually do so with the threat of revoking her support and finances at the start of college. She refuses to trust her with absolutely anything despite numerous situations in which she has proven her trustworthiness She doesn’t let her go out on her own ever without giving update texts or phone calls every 20 minutes, and most of the time she won't let her go out at all, she has an extremely early curfew (7 pm) and will force her to rearrange premade plans to have the friends visit her house where she can keep an eye on them rather than give her an ounce of freedom and trust. She doesn’t take her to doctors' appointments despite having excellent insurance because she “just doesn’t want to deal with the hassle of making the appointment”. 

For example, her mother never took her to a gynecologist and fought tooth and nail to stop her from doing so up until very recently, in which her mother shakily agreed to let her go, made an appointment, and then threatened to cancel the appointment because she’s going for the wrong reasons (she wanted to get on birth control, her mother believes birth control does not work at all), she lorded the threat of not supporting her through college over her as a means of getting her to back down from attempting to go to the gynecologist. Her mother has struck the fear of pregnancy so deep into her heart that intimacy results in a month of anxiety until her next period. She is slowly overcoming that fear as she is learning actual sex ed via her own research now but it can be very hard for her sometimes.

She’s in her last year of high school and will soon be applying to college, which will mean moving away from her mother. She is eager to get out and be free from the emotional torment, but the homestretch seems to be the hardest part, whether it’s the fact that it’s almost over making her more aware of the abuse, or her mother ramping it up as she is now losing control of her, I don’t know. I haven’t been allowed to visit her in over a month now because her mother might call the police if I’m there (and for the record nothing has happened, she’s just afraid I’m going to get her daughter pregnant despite us not even having had sex yet). 

I swear I’m not just trying to tear apart the relationship between mother and daughter so I can keep her to myself and not have to worry about tiptoeing around her mother. I’m just worried for the woman I love, the relationship seems extremely unhealthy, they live in the same house but talk only through text and usually, those talks consist of the mother just yelling at her and calling her a horrible person. 

She has 7 months left before she gets out for college but we can’t see each other and she seems to be majorly depressed because of her home life, she has no other relatives she can stay with, and if she left home to stay with friends or (god forbid) me, her mother would call the police. 

I just want to help her deal with this abuse, or at the very least I want to alleviate her suffering and provide some kind of escape in the last few months of it. 

My girlfriend herself does believe that it's abusive, she says she never noticed how bad it was until she met my family.

eqejen,Not sure what to do.,"This started about 9 or so months ago and I don't know what to do as not even law enforcement would help me.   
I let my newly Ex girlfriend move in with me and my family. Everything was fine for a couple days but then she would start yelling randomly at me and my family. At the time I thought it was just due to stress. I would use money that I earned to buy stuff for her and every time I bought her something she would hit me hard enough to hurt (I have low pain tolerance) but not hard enough to leave a mark. I wanted to tell someone but I was scared that she might hurt me especially since she ALWAYS had a pocket knife with her. She would force me to go out to places with her, force me to go shopping with her. Whenever I would say no she would just yell and try to hit me. Then within 3 months she kept pestering me about ""wanting to have sex"". I kept telling her no until she finally broke me with it. Then one night I was too tired and said no and I woke up that night with her ONTOP of me. I wanted to tell someone but she said not to or I'd get hurt. After a while I was put into the hospital from depression and fear. When I got out of the hospital she was gone and accused me of raping her, manipulating her, and abusing her. At this point she has gotten a restraining order on me over all this stuff that I supposedly did and she has constantly tried to contact me through my friends and family.   
When this all started I was 17 and she was 20. Now I'm 18 and she is 21.

eqm3o7,Emotionally and physically abused by my parents,"Hello, I'm usually a very closed of person and it's very nerve-racking to post but I guess I need advice because I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a 14-year-old girl and the neglect and abuse I get from my parents made me depressed with suicidal tendencies from a very young age, I remember trying to kill myself when I was like 7 or 8 and my parents laughing at me. They always ridicule me and laugh at my problems by punishing me for doing even a tiny mistake, they started hiring me from 3 years old as I remember (they will never admit it). When I was born my mother was 25 and my biological father was 21(too young and immature for a child). My mother always said to me that she loves me but her actions don't justify it. She lets my father abuse me from a very young age. (and to mention he was in his early twenties). When I was 5 we moved in with my grandmother(biological fathers mother) because my mother was pregnant with my brother. I didn't want a brother.one vivid memory I remember is when my grandmother stepped on my puppies head and crushed its skull. I think I may have left a traumatic memory in my head. Well, I grew up with a lot of threats eg. If I don't brush my long hair they'll cut it and if I don't behave they will sell me or give me to the orphanage. The most common practice of abuse was punching and hiring me in the head the most and yelling at me every day to this day. Let's not forget by calling me garbage and a rat and something like that and if I say it back I will get ""punished"". I remember as well when I was very young and accidentally I unhung my mother's coat and repeatedly saying sorry apparently doesn't work, I got hit a lot that day. And the thing is I'm an excellent student at my school(at this time I'm not doing that well because I'm always depressed and find it hard to focus and get out of bed that's why I'm always late, today my history teacher noticed that I'm always late and that I'm always sad and asked if I'm okay and it was weird because no one cares about me they just don't notice when I'm absent, and I said to the teacher that I'm okay and just sad that I have to wake up early which was partly true, so I don't get any more attention, because I like to suffer alone I guess this is what abuse does to you)and they don't give a shit, I guess they like to ""punish' me. From now on I will call my biological father "" him"" because I'm discussed to know that he is my father and I don't call him father anymore. So he is very controlling and he gave me an old computer (this was about 2013-2014) and it was set so I could only use for like 2 hours a day(very fun, I know). Had a flip phone as well I guess. Then I got the tiny white Samsung phone that had sims on it or something like that(it didn't work so I only played that ship game witch was only in Russian). At the same year, I got gifted a black with tan point chihuahua by the mother witch I called chica(she is 6 now and still my best friend although I got another pet which is a sphinx cat called mumy) soI guess gas forward to 2016 which was like the worst year in my life at school and in general. so in 2017I', I've finally bought my phone(Samsung galaxy s7), so this was in early summer half the price was paid from my money and half the price was paid by my mother, so it was technically mine, right? Apparently no. so I've learnt that my Mother is pregnant(by twins this time) and decided to leave me at some kind of horse camp where we literally slept on hays and could trot on a horse for 10-15 min a day for like 2-3 days out of 5 and my parents told me that they will come first to pick me up I was delighted by the news and apparently, phones were not allowed so I got my phone taken away from me although I bought it and guess what I'm waiting for my parent to arrive first and I was literally left alone because everyone else's parents came to pick them up and I was left alone crying. I was given an option to go home with my friend's parent which I accepted because I lost hope and guess what when I sit in the car my fucking parents arrive. They arrived last and I was very upset and furious and remember I was like 11-12. Well I started crying and they didn't like it they said that they had to go to another city which was like 2h away to an ultrasound appointment or something. You tell me they couldn't do the appointment another day? They specifically chose this day. As I said I was furious and they're solution? Force me out of the car in the middle of a forest and leave me(wow, amazing parents right?) At this time I didn't literary care about it I just wanted to get far away from them. I just wanted to die. Well, of course, they came back saying that this was a warning, well this wasn't the first time either. So I got punished by getting everything was taken away from me(yay) well guess what I got a literal panic attack and they told me I was acting(very fun) I think lest remember 2018 summer?( i don't really remember but I think it was 2018) so because it got too quiet my father started taking action by terrorizing me at night( banging at all my windows if I was watching tv and so on) then I did nothing I just turned off the lights and its calm so because nothing was happening and I refused to leave my room because of being tired of conflicts he decided to cut off the internet for me. So I started using my mobile data. Well his plan didn't work so something happened I don't remember but it turned into my mother and grandmother tieing me down sitting on me and trying to drug me( they'll never admit it) and of course, I didn't give up. Well after that incident few months later I was researching personality types and was going to show it to my mother when I was struck by a very loud sound which was the tv on a very high volume and no one was watching (I have a very sensitive hearing) so I asked to turn the volume down, no answer, so I turned the volume down myself and was threatened by him turning the volume very loud so I thought I will just unplug the cable and the tv will turn off so that turned out by him lifting me up on a wall by my neck almost strangling me. I almost passed out(i desperately asked to go to the hospital but everyone was ignorant and told me it was my fault). While writing this sentence I remembered when I knocked over a flower pot and was hit by him to clean it up he even pretended to call the police and take me away to the asylum and taking all my certificates and threatening to destroy them. I HATE HIM HES RUING MY LIFE. So fast forward to early 2019 when there a conflict occurred when my mother and grandmother tried to try his methods. It started out by them carrying this disgusting smelling candles that I was very squeamish to so the came near my room and I asked not to smoke there but they don't listen I didn't let them in and they started pushing me in self-defence I started pushing back and they accused me of pushing them then they entered and I blew the candle out they go furious and mother grabbed me by the hair and slammed me by the floor then both of them sat on me as I was struggling to breathe after I threatened them they left the quickly I dialled 112 and told my situation then my grandma took the phone and told something to the operator(she is very good at lying) so the police and the child rights got involves but the thing is they didn't get told that I was abused grandma said something about me and they were all against me I think she told that I was carrying knives and trying to kill my siblings or something like that which I never did. So yeah I was blamed for everything and they moved on. So 2019 the very start of the school it was Thursday I was dressed completely green I got home hungry I asked for my mother to cook me tho frozen chicken nuggets she was ""busy"" by watching some Indian show so I placed the chicken Nugget pack on her to get her attention( it was opened) it slipped and some of the nuggets got on the couch nothing wrong right? Wrong, he picks them up and was storming for my room to toss them on my bed (it was common to practise) midway to my room I grabbed him his shirt to stop when suddenly I feel a very strong hit from the back of my head I still remember his facial expression it was terrifying. I saw static a for a few seconds very black, I lost balance stumbled a bit but got back up fairy quickly(this was a concussion) and don't remember exactly what happed but he tossed them in my room I guess and then I pick it up and tossed it at him again. I panicked because of my head injury begged my mom to take to the hospital... she grabbed my shirt and dragged me outside in the cold rain while I was having a panic attack... didn't go to school for like two day or something and my mom was mad. So second incident November 1. It was like a fight with my brother that escalated into me calling again. Started because he took the PlayStation controllers and after a month of not playing I wanted to play rdr2. Mom was laughing at us fighting and that ended up with me getting attacked by my mother. So Saturday things are not good. Sunday I go to the stables( started riding in November 2018) I come back tired go to sleep. Monday I go to school bus desperately need someone to talk to about biotechnology and its major. So I come back home look for my computer- cant finds it. Retrieve PlayStation and CDs mom gets furious. We get in a fight I get very injured from self-defence I got everything taken away from me. I find an old phone and dial 112. Well as I find out he suggested that mom should take away everything I have and he didn't let mom talk to me. So police arrive one of the policemen are my class friends father we wait until child rights arrive they decide it's not safe for me and take me to the person who takes care of children they tell my parent to give my stuff back so next day im shaking from stress and anxiety have to go to school. I was not allowed to speak to my home but I did I went to the bathroom and met my mother we hugged and everything she was crying I wasn't.so get back to the helper eat there and play solitaire on computer until I heard that I can go home so a worker takes me there they say if I need help to contact the but the thing is I don't know her contacts and I didn't have a phone. So I come back home and it's empty. Wait a bit, my parents come back and start to ridicule me and make fun of me, apparently because the other time it was against me so there was a threat level at home to my siblings because of ME. And I didn't get any help or consultations they were at his side and everyone at my ""family"" told me no one ever will believe me. I didn't get my phone back to the 21st of November. 29th of November I got my sphynx cat and 21 of December I went to my first showjumping horse show 80cm bu because of all the stress and anxiety I failed and after 2 obstacles I got lost in thought and the horse pulled me out of the arena and that's it... my mother insisted to take me home but she didn't she went o a city did not take me home and I sat like 6 hours in the car she didn't care that I was in terrible shape.so on Christmas eve, I had to leave because I turned on the tv and he turned it off so I left mom was mad at me. O yeah, so this Friday I got back from the stable the door was locked I pushed the button to alert that the door was locked he came out look that it was me and just stood the smiling so I kept clicking until mom came and she didn't let me in either, they took out the alarm that notified the doorbell so the bell didn't wor they came and showed it through the window than god grandmother came back and he had to let me in. I was furious. So later that evening I came and poured myself some yoghurt and took out some ice cream cake that I will never eat again so guess what? He took my ice cream and threw it in the garbage no one cared. Saturday got hit in the back of the head again not that strong this time but I think it was enough to get a third concussion. Grandma justifies his actions and says she will always defend him and will never listen to me and will always blame me because he is her son. Now I really see that mom is controlled a lot he may get her pregnant for her not o leave because she left him with me when I was 2 or 3. Where will she go with 4 children? So as I said grandmother blames me for everything a 14 for her 35year old immature son with a lot of issues. I'm not saying I don't have issues I have a lot but they'll never take the blame for it even if he killed me. Does Grandma say that I'm just waiting for him to kill me also she says that I'm trying to destroy and ruin this ""family"" she sais that I'm using drugs at the stables(which I do not) well any advice?

Replace they with he.

I heard the man cussing at her while putting her into her car seat while she was still crying. I wanted to do something, but I thought that if I did, then the dad would blame the girl and would hurt her when they got home ( where I couldn't stop it ). Then, the mom came out and they drove away. I feel so horrible for not even attempting to help. I've grown up in an abusive household, and that shit does numbers on you.

eqo5id,Half sisters struggles.,"Recently I have started to theorise that my half sister is not in actual fact genetically my half sister. The reason being is that my father gave me the details of the sexual encounter that conceived her. He was 50 ish, already developing arthritis and the er... 'garden' was mostly dry. 

To me it seems incredibly unlikely for a man getting on in his years to conceive like that when a 20 year old man would have less than a 20% chance of conceiving on the first time.

Not really massively relevant, but it is in a strange way. 

When my dad was passing my half sisters mother showed that she was a bit of an abusive personality. She seems to get these rage attacks that don't end that I saw once when I was going to the zoo, my mother, this woman, my sister (I will cut out the 'half' from now on) and me. I cannot recall the problem that started it but it was something to do with map reading and she got into this kind of rage attack that went on and on, she literally went on and on for the entire one and a half hour drive back. My father said she obsessed over it for several months every day after this event. Some sort of narcissism?

My father had some sort of sore on his ass and said to me once, with some upset and frustration, that she would not even let him sit down even though he had advanced arthritis by that time. There were other cruel things.

Also, when I asked my sister a few years ago if her mother had got better since Ian died, assuming some of his pedantic and controlling behaviours were winding her up, she said that her mother had got worse since he died. But I never saw it after he died (in 2012). There are other examples of neglect and cruelty.

Fast foward to today and I have not been using my brain. I have not thought through that a woman with this background might not treat my sister very well. I have zero proof but there are some things that make me think there is really something quite off about the household. 

She doesn't laugh for one. I have never heard my sister laugh. Ever. Not since I used to tickle her when she was about five. She discusses problems. When I used to go round or spend any time with her I found it very deliberately from her that she would focus the conversation on me and keep it away from herself. She didn't tell me about friends, her boyfriend, or anything. It is difficult to get anything out of her. 

I basically have broken contact at the time I did so because I thought she basically didn't like me. I think that is a reasonable leap to make. She was doing things like not doing basic ritual politeness. Like not updating via text if some arrangement was moved about. Other things as well and if you are not communicating properly with someone then that makes sense.

It may not be right. I have never had that feeling from her, I felt a lot when I was actually with her admiration and warmth, like someone is there to be nice to her. In fact her communication is often a bit desperate seeming and odd. Especially if I say anything along the lines of 'goodbye'. She suddenly gets desperate. I feel sometimes when I talk to her that she has a very good front, like very good, almost impenetrable, but there is something there basically undeveloped. I was more developed by the time I was her age (16).

I wonder if she was told ahead of time about us not having the same father. I had assumed that. But, considering the evidence of her mothers temperament it is just as likely to be something else.

Her mother's type of personality is known to be very protective, she did not let her daughter watch 12 certificate films until she was 12 for instance, and apparently tried to be present at school for her prom. My sister has mentioned nagging about homework. My father once said in a drunken stupor where he would forget really basic things that her mother had broken her arm once. The reason given for having broken the arm didn't sound like her. One time I was questioning my sister on this and she gave me what I think is the classic abuse victim answer. She said sometimes her mother gets firm with her but it's quote; ""because I deserve it"". My sister is very protective of her mother.

Another weird thing is there is a guy that has turned up for my fathers widow and it was precisely when my sisters mother met this guy that she started to get noticeably weirder at that point and never became more positive. I have met the guy only once but the timing for my sisters strange behaviour is perfect. I recall she was more honest before she met him and before a certain trip to my sisters mothers home country that felt a bit odd. It's weird having no other evidence on this point. It would make sense if he was her real father and she had been told on this trip. But I don't know that. This idea puts my sisters mothers behaviour under scrutiny as being of a certain machiavellian negative quality. This angle would also explain them not making any real effort with me like Christmas presents or things because assumedly they would see me as a kind of genetic appendage of a person they had used for a goal (such as citizenship, and also my sisters mother inherited being next of kin when my father died)

She gets very high grades. I'm hoping she will go and live in halls but her A levels will take another year and a half.

There was an odd moment once between us two (for reference in this paragraph if it is not obvious I am male). I couldn't really tell you why but I went round, I was a little sick from high bloodsugars. I am a diabetic. Anyway, we were chatting and I reached for her foot. I don't know why but it was not in a sexual manner but I suppose reminiscent of tickling when we were young. My bloodsugars had knocked off any awareness of sexual feeling or drive at 30 BMI, enough to put someone in hospital after about two days. But she withdrew and said something to me pointedly like she didn't like that. Which I was like 'OK no big deal'. Then we decided to watch a film and she invited me to sit on the bed with her and I wasn't comfortable with that and kind of felt it a bit odd to have just defined a boundary then have it immediately broken, should we just stick with 1-2 ft? So we sat on the floor and I hugged her that I often do in a non sexual capacity and she was obviously tense. So I left. That felt real odd. I didn't like that feeling one bit.

Damn I don't like this but I'll continue, another poster here said something about saying things on here. There was another moment when I was feeling a bit odd because she was dressing in very revealing clothes, and I felt a kind of pressure from her that I couldn't identify. Especially leg wise. But then that stopped. She had been working in a cafe with a guy who had been trafficking children and the cafe got shut down because he went to jail. 

There is no sexual weirdness anymore. Although a feeling I have but have little (but not no) evidence for is she is pushing it a little. Could be puberty- ish ness though. 

So yeah, that's all I have to say on that. The girl is probably not genetically related to me and is very much a mystery to me. I have made it clear to her though I still care about her despite the possibility of us not being genetically related. I can't really plumb into the situation in any depth, I don't know if any of my behaviours are exacerbating the situation or if I have missed something. It really does feel a bit odd. I am practically powerless in this situation as far as I can see. I feel I would be remiss to not examine the potential abuse angle. 

I've kind of talked myself out of the abuse angle though by saying she was just in a strange place having no real genetic link to me and having me think I was her brother. I had started the query as a legitimate abuse query.

At this point though I feel rather powerless like I said. I can't help with money, I haven't told people around me about any of this. Not until I know what to do with it more precisely.",Phoenix9061210,2020-01-18 15:19:15,1,1518,21.6,37.58,58.77,14.04,16.5,15.68,93.48,61.53,21.21,14.03,7.77,0.53,0.13,5.4,0.2,7.18,4.74,12.38,10.61,6.72,7.31,3.23,18.77,4.02,2.24,1.25,2.11,2.31,4.28,1.71,2.57,0.46,0.92,0.13,12.85,2.77,0.46,6.79,1.98,17.39,4.02,1.58,2.11,5.01,1.52,5.53,2.96,0.72,1.05,1.19,1.45,0.46,0.46,0.33,0.2,5.8,2.44,0.72,1.32,1.25,0.46,7.77,8.43,0.92,12.52,1.52,5.27,5.86,0.59,0.53,0.33,0.2,0.13,0.26,0.53,0.13,0,0.13,0.2,0.07,11.79,6.06,2.04,0,0.07,0.13,0,0.13,0.13,2.37,0.79,0.07
eqp6jw,Is it abuse or am I just overreacting?,"Hey there. Sorry if this question doesn't fit here, I just really need to get some answers. I also have to apologize for any mistakes I'm about to make with my grammar etc, as english isn't my native language.

I don't feel comfortable sharing a lot of my personal information on the internet, but I am rather young, and male. The reason I'm posting this is that I've just now had a fight with my father (again) and I'm very upset about it and finally want to get some clarity on my situation.

 Now, I know that I was and still am a very difficult child, having had anger management issues from a young age on (altough I do not know if they developed because of my father or if they were there before). My father has never hit me as far as I can remember, but he used to grab me by my mouth&amp;nose, shove me against a wall and shout at me. I really did not like it as I could hardly breathe when he did that. He'd then usually tell me to apologize, which I couldn't do, since his hand was over my mouth. I hated my father and whenever I knew I made him angry somehow, I'd run into my room and try to prevent him from getting in by shoving things in front of the door, but that obviously never worked. My mother never said anything about it and my younger siblings didn't get the same treatment. He would shout at them sometimes, but never shove them or grab them by their neck/face. I don't know when it started, but I know it was before primary school and possibly before Kindergarden, but I can't remember. It stopped when I was around 13 i think.

Even though I don't know if my father caused my anger issues, he definetly made them worse. I was nearly kicked out of primary and secondary school because I was violent and agressive. I screamed a lot and hit other children. Because of that, I really didn't have any friends and the teachers didn't like me either. Eventually, my anger even escalated so much, that when my father got angry at me, I grabbed a knife and told him to stay away or I'd stab him. I think I was about 11 at the time. Long story short, I obviously didn't stab him. He told me he'd break my arm if I tried so I got scared. That didn't change the fact that I frequently fantasized about killing him however. I remember wanting to just get up one night and kill him in his sleep, but I never followed through on it. 

Once I learned that hitting or hurting your children otherwise was illegal, I told my father I'd tell the police, but he just said that only hitting children was illegal and He never did that. And I believed him. But around that time, he stopped hurting me physically. I don't exactly know why, but I think it was because I was getting older and had a good relationship with one of my teachers who I'd frequently talk to. Or maybe he realised he did something wrong, but I don't think so. However, since then I started noticing other ways he'd make me feel bad. For example, I have 3 younger siblings and, as siblings do, we'd fight a lot. And whenever it started to annoy him, he'd yell at me for ruining (insert whatever activity we were trying to do). 

My father, like me, takes great pride in being smart. But, unlike me, he believes a lot of things he hears on the Internet. For example, me and my siblings are unvaccinated. My siblings don't see a Problem with that, as they are likely to young to understand, but I do and I tried telling my parents about it. My answer was getting laughed and finally shouted at. Now, when I say my father believes a lot of things in the Internet, I was kind of lying. He only believes things in the Internet, that I am not using to verify arguments. For example, I was talking about that brain eating amoeba thing and my father started sarcastically saying things like ""yeah right"" and ""of course"" (he often does things like that. If he thinks something isn't right or doesn't exist, then he's right and everyone who says otherwise is stupid and lying. Its annoying as hell), so I looked up some articles, some Wikipedia pages and an actual doctor talking about it. He still stood by his opinion that something like that wasn't real and ignored me explaining my points. He then said even If something like that existed (which shouldn't be questionable anymore after I showed him actual doctors talking about it but whatever) it wouldn't happen to him.
As previously mentioned, he's an antivaxxer and pretty much immune to logic. So even when I started bringing in more logic, like that because he plays the lottery and thinks it could happen to him, it is completely hypocritical to say ""something like that could never happen"", he started ridiculing me again, saying that it isn't the same and that he wasn't going to change his views anyways. Its like he can't accept the fact that he's wrong.
 I pretty much gave up at that point and locked myself in the bathroom to cry.  Please before you judge me for talking about my father this way, please keep in mind that the previously mentioned events aren't things that only happened once or twice, they usually happen every other day.

Even though this kind of screams ""abuse"" for me, I kind of don't want to believe it is. Especially because both of my parents have been very supportive with things like my transition and stuff I do for school. My mother also recently apologised for not saying anything when my father used to grab me etc.",GalacticLeaderCyrus,2020-01-18 16:38:25,0,1004,6.98,20.7,83.7,3.66,18.94,17.83,93.92,62.95,25.1,17.23,11.55,0.2,0.2,4.38,0.9,7.87,2.99,11.95,9.26,8.47,10.26,3.49,20.72,4.28,3.09,1.59,0.8,1.79,5.78,1.69,3.98,0.2,2.29,0.5,12.65,2.09,0.1,0.2,5.68,17.93,3.49,1.99,2.09,5.18,1.59,6.08,3.09,0.4,1.69,0.9,1.49,1,0.4,0,0.1,5.78,1.2,0.6,1.89,1.2,0.9,6.97,9.86,0.6,12.25,1,4.48,6.77,1.39,0.3,0.3,0.1,0.1,0.2,0.4,0.1,0,0.1,0,0.1,16.93,5.18,5.38,0,0.1,0.1,0,0,0.8,4.18,1,0.2
eqq1im,"I really need advice, Please. (TW, sexual abuse, physical abuse, kind of psychological abuse????)","Hi,
(I’m sorry this is so long.) 
My name is Evie (F15,) and I just need some advice, but I’m sorry if any of this comes off as dramatic. Hell, I’m probably overreacting anyway but I need to talk about it. 

My biological family is full of criminals and drug addicts, hell, I got put into foster care when I was 4 after my father (who is in prison for attempted homocide,) set the house on fire with me inside of it, but then when I was 7 I got adopted into the family I am in now- which takes me to now. 

Since I got adopted, my adoptive father (M55; I will call him J,) hasn’t been nice. At all. 
Originally, J would just talk about how I wasn’t his real daughter; and how my (biological,) brother (who they also adopted,) wasn’t his real son- and how he only agreed to adopting us because my M’aam wanted to do so. When we had been adopted for a few months and the social workers stopped surveying us, he began hitting us. 
At first it would only be on the butt, and thighs, but eventually he began doing it on our faces and anywhere he could get to. I thought it was normal; it was all I’d ever known. 

I distinctly remember a time when I was nine and my brother (who is two years older than me,) tried to go upstairs as J was yelling, but then he pinned my brother to the wall with his neck and began threatening him. My mum just kept on eating as if nothing was happening, but I tried to stop him. Looking back it was stupid, but I was terrified. I pulled on J’s arm and he turned around and backhanded me twice, and all I remember is hitting my head on the floor and waking up in my bed. I got no apology. It was my fault. 
After that, J wouldn’t go after my brother- only me. I don’t know if it is because he knew I would fight back, and do anything to protect my brother, but either way he focused on me- and I hate to admit that I was happy about it. Better me than him, I guess. 

He would yell at me for the smallest of things; looking at him ‘the wrong way,’ even fucking BREATHING too loud, and if I argued back he would beat me. 

Once I was tidying my room and tried to get some water, but he was waiting outside my room and when I tried to leave he got really angry. He cornered me at the top of the stairs and when I tried to move fast him, he threw me down and I sprained my ankle. Again, no fucking apology. 

He would wait until my mother was gone to yell usually, and then act like everything was normal when he got back, as if my arms and legs weren’t covered in bruises because of *him.* 

I thought everything was normal, until high school. When I was 11, I made a friend, who I will call L. L was amazing, and is my best friend to this day, and at first she didn’t realise anything was wrong. 
One day, I casually mentioned how my stomach and arms hurt because of the beating the night before, and she was confused. She asked to see what I was talking about and then started crying when I showed her. I thought she was being dramatic and said that it was a one time thing because I didn’t want to upset her. 

I promised to her that if he ever did it again I would tell her. I didn’t. 

I was fine with the yelling, and berating. Hell, even the beating- but then he started touching me. 

When I was thirteen, he began asking to spend more ‘father-daughter’ time with me, to ‘bond.’ I agreed because I thought it meant he finally loved me. It didn’t. 

At first he began asking about my sex life (I was raped when I was eleven by three seventeen year old guys that I knew,) and would talk about how mature I was. He even jokingly asked if I wanted to invite them over to ‘have fun.’ 
Then, he began talking about how my body was maturing and how I was getting ‘hotter’ and ‘looked so much older than I was.’ He would come up behind me and touch my back, and gradually got lower and lower until he was touching my ass. The one time I tried to stop him he punched me in the gut and told me that if I wanted him to stop I wouldn’t be a slut (but?? I was fucking THIRTEEN years old?) 
I never fought back again, but it only got worse. He would ask my mother for time alone with me to ‘watch a movie,’ and then while we sat on the couch (he’d always make me sit with him,) he would begin touching my thigh, and slowly got higher. He started putting on more and more sexual movies, until it was basically soft porn, and he’d talk about how the women had ‘nice tits,’ and how he would bet that ‘[mine] were better.’ 

I would always brush it off as a joke, until one day he said something along the lines of “wouldn’t you agree, sweetheart?? Let’s see.”
So I tried to leave, again, thinking it was a joke- until he wouldn’t let me. I was really confused. I never thought that he would go that far, until he pushed my onto the couch, hit my head on the wall so I was dizzy, and began taking my top off. 
He got his phone out and recorded everything he did, and threatened that he would release it if I told. 
The next week he put on videos of makeout sessions in movies, and told me I had to recreate it with him. I had no choice (although I guess I did, which makes me fucking hate myself.) 
Then he began putting on porn (handjobs, blowjobs etc,) and told me to recreate hit on him- until eventually he made me have complete sex with him. 

Up until a few months ago, I didn’t even see this as wrong; never mind abuse. Never mind r a p e. 
I guess it is rape, which I hate. 

He got arrested when one of  his coworkers saw one of the videos while using his phone. 
My M’aam was in denial. My brother was in denial. Even I was in fucking denial. 

He isn’t here anymore, and my mother ended up siding with me. Both my brother and mother blame themselves, which is insane because if anyone should feel guilty it’s him,, and me, I guess, for provoking him or clearly doing SOMETHING wrong. 

I don’t see why he would do it if I didn’t do something wrong. I had to have. 
I don’t want to believe that we live in a world where people are that evil for no reason. 

I don’t know why I posted this. To see if it is my fault, in some ways?? To get advice?? 

I just, I’m trying to recover but I don’t know HOW to deal with this shit. 
It feels amazing waking up knowing I won’t be beaten, or r*ped, but then I will look at the couch, or even my own fucking bed and be reminded of it. 

I don’t know if I’ll ever get over it. 

If anyone has any advice, please PLEASE put it here. 

I have been seeing a therapist for four years and take Sertraline but he can’t seem to help me and I don’t want to believe that I am helpless. 

I am sorry if you do not care; or for wasting your time.

eqzibh,Is this abuse?,"My father used to spend time with me when I was younger and I was super close to him (even though I was a bit of a brat). After my brother was born, he was immediately rushed to the ICU and he has special needs. This obviously makes my family busy, my mother stays in hospital and my father looks after me because I was only seven at the time. But the thing is, from what I remember, he was never there. He was always out working. I mean, obviously, my mum can’t do anything because she’s looking after my brother. I never got the emotional support I needed and I don’t blame anyone because this hurt everyone in my family and we all dealt with it differently. Now my brother still has special needs but he’s the cutest, happiest kid you’ve ever seen and I would never want to replace him with everyone else. Me and my mum was alright after that,  but she’s very stressed all the time. She needs to look after my brother a lot and worries, understandable. But all my father does is go out and work and then visit a friend’s house. A few years back I couldn’t tidy my bedroom because I was late for school and he yelled at me because I’m apparently “not a woman if I can’t do housework” and I was upset, sure, but it was one of those days where everyone was a bit pissed. Again, he says that wives should be put into place with another friend but my mum doesn’t take that shit from him. It’s been a year and he hasn’t shown that type of behaviour again. But I was taking a test for a private school and both my parents really took care of me, they did everything I wanted as long as I studied, or maybe they were trying to support me? But they also yelled at me a lot for messing stuff up, I think that’s normal? It wasn’t bad but it was still really hurtful. But anyway, I got in. And I get good grades (?) But this one time I got six marks off a maths test, which I don’t think is bad at all but then he got really mad at me. My mum talked to him and he stopped but he never apologised. Now whenever he talks to me all he talks about are grades or he asks whether I have a test or not. I feel like a machine rather than a human. Sometimes he’ll say that I don’t love him because I never initiate to hug him but he doesn’t either! I mean, I’m not a father, but isn’t that their duty? I would want to spend time with someone that didn’t seem uninterested. Now he starts yelling at my mother for not covering the pots properly or looking after my brother when he knows he can’t do it. He says all this bullshit which isn’t true is it because he’s stressed? Suddenly he’s really nice again and he says he loves us and I’m so confused I don’t even know if he’s bad or good or sick or something else.

The way he treats me is unacceptable but I don’t think I am strong enough to leave. He will text his ex girlfriend and when I ask about it, he calls me insane. Sometimes I still see her name on his phone but I just don’t say anything because I don’t want him to yell or threaten to leave me. He will also say things that he SAID and act like he didn’t say them making me believe I am crazy. He will call girls hot with his friends right in front of me, and doesn’t understand why I get upset. And the worst part is; he blames me for EVERYTHING.

He does a lot of bad things, but I definitely outweigh the bad with the good because I truly am in love with him and I don’t see myself leaving. His anger issues and screaming occur almost daily and I don’t see them stoping anytime soon. He will call me awful names and make me question my own worth. He will say I make his life way more difficult that it is and I tell him it doesn’t have to be that way and he will say “ I’m stuck in this relationship anyway” I’m so good to him and so sweet and I’m not sure why he treats me like this. All I need is clarity and I have yet to find it.

One day he thought I broke the washing machine when I didn’t even use it that day and he said “ are you fucking stupid? Oh wait, I forgot you were” and when I cry about the mean things he says he will say “ are you seriously crying again”

Another thing. He will lie about things. A lot. Especially when it comes to girls.

Today I washed and dried his clothes and apparently his clothes were wrinkly and he got mad and said “ you can’t do anything right. Don’t touch my clothes again.”

Also. He has never hit me, and sometimes he can very very sweet which is honestly the only reason why I’m still with him. He will cook me dinner and fix me a plate before he fixes his own, pays for my gas, does all the gentleman things.

er0kwo,"Hi, this is my first post here.","So this is my first post on abuse. Guess i'll start with my story then. I've been emotionally neglected and abused, and physically neglected my whole life by my parents, particularly by my mom. It started out as emotional abuse and neglect early on, at only a couple years old. I'll just sum up my parents as believing in mostly nature over nurture. My dad was rarely home, as he worked long hours to get by, at home he had nothing to do with me until i got old enough, which he started taking me to work with him (which i enjoyed a lot). My mom would rarely offer comfort, most often she would take it away, thinking it made you weak. Whenever i didn't listen or didn't know how to do something, she'd rarely offer encouragement or help me learn how to do things, instead she would threaten me with abandonment, or chop up things like my baby blanket. She believed that you just ""know"" how to do everything as you age and dont need to be taught. She thought that something was wrong with me when i was 3 for not knowing the alphabet, so she taught me but was very strict and mean about it. Anyways, later she would resort to spanking with a big soup spoon, but would ""miss"" and hit us in the back. Whenever we went to her for help, to tell her how we felt, it would either be a ""welp, i dont know what to tell'ya"" or straight up yell at us for not growing up or something. And whenever i did try to develop and such i would get laughed at or teased by my whole family, thinking im being weird (they consider it, among other things, to be for ""yuppies""). In general my parents taught me nothing, and instead made me afraid of everything. I also had a bedwetting issue that they did little about. Years later, when i was around 8, my parents divorced, which involved a ton of fighting, that they did right in front of us. At this point i gave up, i started failing school, loss interest in everything, etc. A lot of shit that shouldn't have been done happened because of this, my dad constantly put us in the middle of everything, my mom stopped caring at all about us, i nearly died from appendacitis because of that, she also threatened to kill herslef in fornt of me and my brother because our dad told us to be assholes to her, and it's apparent to me now that neither cared about our happiness or wellbeing, but instead their own, since they constantly fought over having us (my mom got custody). Things only got worse, she would lock us upstairs all day, apparently to have sex (im not sure if its true since my dad told me this, and they both lied to us A LOT), etc. We then moved in with her new boyfriend some 85miles away (who was a convicted rapist, but was overall a pretty nice guy i guess, but still). His sons tormented horribly, locking us in closets all day while screaming at us. We became so afraid of them that we would hide all day if we were left alone with them. My mom blames us for it for not telling her (which we did, but she never listened). at this my bedwetting and schooling had gotten much worse, i slept in a piss soaked bed for two years, and my grades dropped even further. As for my grades, she'd just yell at me for not trying. I became a complete shut in at this point, i had friends, but rarely hungout. I also couldnt shower daily, i just couldnt do it, i still cant. All my mom seemed to care about was that i was perfect and did what she wanted, which i never did and i guess she just...assumed im bad? Eventually we got out of there when her boyrfriend relapsed, and but i still didnt do much better in my head. But i finally saw a doctor for the bedwetting and got put on meds for it, which was nice. But i still didnt feel better, every little ting was still a horrible struggle (most things became impossible or totally pointless to me), i was never happy no matter what i did, still afraid of everything, had no idea how to tell anoyone, i had no idea what was wrong, but knew that something wasnt right. I lost all will to do things most people want to do, and also became to scared to try if i did. There's more to this, that's all i can type for now.",Bacongod239,2020-01-19 11:05:32,7,800,11.86,46.5,80.34,2.17,23.53,14.12,95,64,23.62,16.5,9.25,2.75,0.5,3,1,7.12,2.25,14.38,10.12,8.38,8.88,3.12,19.75,6,2.5,2.75,0.62,3,7.75,2.5,5.25,1.12,2.12,1.12,13.5,2.38,0.38,3.12,1.62,17.25,2.88,1.5,2.38,4.5,3.12,4.88,1.12,0.12,0.75,0.25,1.62,0.62,0.62,0.25,0.12,10.12,4.25,1.5,2.5,1.62,1.38,9.5,7.38,0.75,14.5,0.62,6.88,6.88,1.62,0.12,0.75,0,0,0.25,0.62,0.38,0.12,0,0,0.12,16.62,4.5,7.75,0,0,0.12,0,0,1,1.5,1.75,0
er0lbh,I need some advice please help me!,"This is a long post so please bear with me. I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 6 years. We have never drank alcohol together before, he explained to me his past and how he used alcohol to cope with problems. He was sober for 4 yrs when we met. He re-enrolled in college and was accepted into an an elite college. I was so proud of him to turning his life around. Alcohol wasn’t an issue anymore. He revealed a lot about his past relationships too. He seemed to always blame the break ups on the girlfriends either they cheated on him, used him or falsely accuse him of abuse when it was them that were abusive or drunk. He blamed them for everything. So I believed him. He felt comfortable sharing so much with me, he never had that before. So 3 months into our relationship he started to get argumentative with me and angry over stupid things. They way I spoke or dressed he compared me to his other girlfriends. Saying at least they cared about the way they dressed and I didn’t seem to. I needed to wear make up and buy more expensive clothes and lose weight he thought I was fat. He knows my past with depression and that I tried to kill myself I was recovering and my self esteem was just getting better and I felt strong. I didn’t understand why he spoke to me like that. I eventually changed things he criticized me about and even became in debt. He was never satisfied it was all superficial and dumb his personality was so negative. I noticed every friday night we would text me msgs that were to critical of me like my appearance, personality or he’d say negative things about my parents for no reason. Then later he’d apologize. This happened every friday night we weren’t living together yet so I didn’t know if he was drinking again or what but I noticed his personality was strange. One night a yr later, we were watching a movie and he surprised me with a bottle of wine and hard liquor. I was shocked considering he used to be an alcoholic, like wtf! I had a long talk with him about it he said only for tonite it’ll be ok. So I gave in and had a bottle of wine with him. The drinks were spaced out then I went to have a sip of the whiskey and the bottle was already empty he drank it! Alcohol makes me sleepy but he didn’t want to sleep he wanted to have sex. We did but while during it he choked me until I passed out. I woke up and he was yelling at me, his eyes were all glassy. I was too drunk to process everything. He called me an over weight fat ass and I was shit and worthless. He could have any woman he wants, I was so drunk everything was a blur I fell asleep and thought it was a dream. I woke up the next day my pillow was covered and wet from my tears. I asked him if he remembered anything from that night he said we had a great time. I refreshed his memory and told him what happened he said he didn’t remember and apologized. Fast forward to september 2019 he bought alcohol I said fine if you want to drink go ahead I’d rather you have it while I’m here so I can make sure you don’t go overboard. He promised me it’ll be the last time he’d have a drink I believed him but I was still pissed off. I didn’t drink things were good but later he demanded to have sex but I didn’t want to. I was just recovering from having the flu and felt weak. He started my car and demanded I leave I refused and tried to calm him down then he all the sudden he put his hand around my throat like he wanted to squeeze it but didn’t he was screaming in my face about how useless I was. He slept in the basement that night and I didn’t go home I tool my keys out of the car and went to bed. He woke up in the morning and was in a really great mood. I started crying my self esteem was non existent and talked about what he did. He said he didn’t remember and convinced me that we were ok it’ll never happen again and I was the love of his life. So I’m having a mental dilema now. I wonder if what he said about his exes was all true. Was it really their fault the relationships ended or was it because of him? Did he act this way with them too? There were three episodes of this drunk behavior its been 4 months now and things have been really good lately. I’m fearful that things might become worse if it happens again. He seems to have a temper even if he is sober I can tell he controls it but I see it fester. Should I break up with him? Should I talk about those drunken nights again? Should I confront him and ask if he drinks without me because his moods are so all over the place? Should I be forgiving and let it go? I’m very insecure people don’t believe me because outwardly I’m such a strong woman. But internally I’m a mess I don’t want to be without him I do love him. Its stupid way of thinking I know. Honestly I have NO one to talk to I’m afraid of being judged.

er15zx,20 year old male abused emotionally by my family. What can I do?,"My parents have always been controlling, but since entering college in the Fall of 2018 things have gone way too far. To put the change in perspective, during high school I had a great deal of friends, participated in multiple organizations, and was the captain of a varsity sports team. 

I attend a university roughly 15 minutes from home, and originally had a dormitory on campus. Move in day happened, but from that day my mom would not let go. She would constantly text. My father would walk around outside the dorm complex. My level of privacy was near zero. I couldn’t go anywhere without them spying on me thanks to Find my iPhone. After about a month of this I gave in and left the dorm to live back at home. 

Academically, my father seems to have a set path for me. I have limited role in choosing my courses even though I explain time and time again about expanding my knowledge in diverse fields. I have spoken to my mother about this, but she doesn’t make any effort to convince him to change his ways. I explain I need to take the courses that will lead me to a good job/graduate program in my field. But to no avail. 

Currently, I live at home and commute to school. Because roughly 95 percent of the students live on campus I have found it nearly impossible to find friends. When I mention to them the possibility of social plans they make excuses for me not to go. And, at this point my only social life consists of seeing extended family members on the weekends and attending class  for a couple hours each day. The last time I spoke to a non family member outside of class without my parents nearby or expecting me at a certain time was August.

I do maintain friendships from high school, but as you all know, those friends get busy and can’t be there to chat all the time. I am asking for any advice on what to do in this situation. Leaving the house likely isn’t a real possibility, and I don’t want to lose my relationship with my parents. 

It is time for me to gain freedom. I am trustworthy. I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I maintain a 4.0 GPA at what I would deem a prestigious university. Thank you all for reading. 

TLDR: 20 year old guy with over controlling parents. Persuaded not to socialize. Important decisions are made for me. Need advice on how to move forward.",nerdypoliticaldude,2020-01-19 11:46:44,5,441,76.88,29.3,96.31,51.21,12.97,18.14,92.52,53.29,14.97,12.02,9.98,0,0.45,0.91,0.68,2.95,5.67,17.46,7.48,3.85,4.54,2.95,16.1,2.04,0.45,1.13,1.59,2.04,2.27,1.81,0.45,0,0.23,0.23,10.2,2.49,0.91,0.91,1.36,13.83,3.17,2.49,2.27,2.04,1.13,3.17,0.68,0.23,0.45,0,1.36,0,0.91,0,0.45,8.84,3.85,1.81,2.49,1.13,0.45,3.17,10.88,0.68,18.59,4.08,8.16,7.03,6.12,1.81,2.27,0,0,0,0.23,0,0.23,0,0,0,12.7,7.48,2.95,0.23,0,0.23,0,0,0,1.59,0,0.23
er1j1j,problems with my mum - read,"I’m 14 years old and a fairly good kid, in my opinion. I’m very athletic and also do really well in school. My older sister, 16, is not very bright and hasn’t done very good in school. She is also quite mean to me. My mum loves her a lot more than me. My mum still beats her as well as me but my mum obviously favors her. A huge factor this is because of my father, who left to another country to go work almost two years ago. My dad has always been supportive of me and has my back all the time. Whenever my dad used to get angry at me, he would actually apologise to me. Me and my dad have a lot in common, our love for sports and we often have deep conversations. My mum despises my dad and religiously divorced him.

My mum deeply favors my sister. My sister can be quite rude and obnoxious to me. She has her own room but I have to share mine with my mum. My dad bought me a gaming pc two years ago but I keep it in my sister’s room because, obviously, there is no space in mine. Therefore, I spend a lot of time with my sister. Whenever my sister is rude to me (swears at me), my mum doesn’t really do anything. However, if I retaliate and say something back, my mum instantly steps towards me, raises her arms and stares me in the eyes telling me to be careful what I say to my sister. 

Whenever my mum is upset, she feels the need to suppress her anger by releasing it on my sister and I. My mum doesn’t let me go outside as much, unless it’s for football, so my phone, my computer and books is really all I can do to stay entertained. Often, she will force me to do something for her by threatening to take my phone or turning off the internet.  You might be thinking, ‘chores every kid should do them,’ but this is different. My mum forces me to come so she can squeeze the pimples on my head. This is obviously a form of satisfaction for her, however it hurts me and gives me headaches in school. I often go to school with red blotches on my forehead making me feel insecure. I can’t concentrate with the pinched pimples on my head as they burn and it makes me scratch them thus giving me head pain. I often try to reason with her and tell her to not do it because it hurts my head but my mum doesn’t understand reasoning. She will scream at me to come if I try to go to my room and this makes me come because if I try to ignore her she will keep screaming at me to come until she loses her temper, takes my phone and hits me.
Furthermore, another way for my mum to release her anger is my calling me names and insulting me. She often calls me ‘gay’ in my language to try to make me angry. She also compares me to my father by saying stuff like ‘You’re a _____ just like your father and such.
As mentioned, I do relatively good in school but my mum still finds a way to demotivate me and criticize me so I lose self - confidence. For example, she will call me dumb and useless and bring up the fact that I didn’t get into a private school to insult me. If I even try retaliate, I know I will be hurt and she will hate me for days on end and not let me do anything till I beg for forgiveness. Her justification for being able to such things to me is that she brought me up and does everything for me.

She does good stuff for me, sometimes I love her more than anything, don’t get me wrong, but often I cry myself to sleep and I know life shouldn’t be like this. I often see people celebrating Christmas and having fun and it brings me to tears. Why could I not have had a childhood like that?

My dad knows what she does to me but he can’t really do anything for me since he is working in another country.

Making this post honestly makes me feel guilty because she has certainly done a lot of good things for me but the bad outweighs the good considerably.",Agile-Chapter,2020-01-19 12:12:24,2,758,15.84,23.81,86.34,9.53,18.49,12.66,97.49,63.46,25.99,21.5,15.83,0.26,0.4,4.62,0.4,4.49,2.77,13.46,9.1,5.54,8.71,1.85,17.02,3.69,2.11,0.92,0.53,1.72,7.65,3.17,4.49,0.53,1.98,1.06,14.38,4.35,0,7.12,1.72,14.91,1.98,2.9,1.32,4.49,1.45,4.35,3.03,0.66,1.06,1.32,2.24,1.06,0.66,0.13,0,7.52,2.11,1.72,1.98,1.58,1.06,1.45,13.19,0.92,11.35,1.72,5.41,4.35,1.85,1.06,0.53,0.26,0.26,0,0.4,0.13,0,0,0.26,0,12.8,5.15,3.83,0,0,0.13,0,0.26,0.4,2.11,0.26,0.66
er1qxv,Child sexual abuse victims,Hi I’m posting here the second time and I won’t be posting here again but I just wanted to ask everyone has your rapist ever told you having sex with your siblings and friends is normal and told you what to do and how to do it? Did you know it was wrong? or were you not aware like I was. Did you ever think being sexual with people was normal and something fun as a child because your rapist kept reminding you how much you wanted it?,uncertainnobody5,2020-01-19 12:28:12,5,92,1.64,98.84,9.25,1,18.4,9.78,96.74,65.22,21.74,15.22,4.35,0,10.87,0,0,6.52,2.17,7.61,16.3,8.7,11.96,2.17,25,5.43,2.17,3.26,1.09,1.09,6.52,1.09,5.43,0,3.26,0,21.74,1.09,1.09,0,0,16.3,3.26,3.26,2.17,2.17,3.26,3.26,0,0,0,0,5.43,0,0,5.43,0,7.61,3.26,0,3.26,0,1.09,11.96,9.78,1.09,4.35,0,0,4.35,0,1.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.52,1.09,0,0,0,3.26,0,0,0,2.17,0,0

er5k0r,Can it be considered sexual assault if the perpetrator was a child?,"A couple times when I was a child on two separate children at different time periods wanted me to have sex with them or touch their genitals, in which I declined. One was a year older than me and one was I think the same age. These took place at 5-7 years old If I'm remembering correctly. One of the kids was my mother's best friend, who was my abuser. So imagine If I told her what her son did? When I was about 17 I randomly mentioned it to my mother whole she was at her friends house (a different friend) and was quickly dismissed with ""that's normal for kids to do.""

er6pk2,Please Help.... Is This Emotional Abuse?,"When my sister(26f) gets angry, it’s not good for me(19f). Usually when she gets angry, it’s over something petty. But she stretches it out for days, weeks, even months. 

When she’s upset, she gives me the silent treatment. This can go as long as SHE wants it to. And it doesn’t stop at just silence. She would turn off lights when I’m in rooms, open doors even when I close them and am clearly looking for privacy, and she chooses when she wants to speak with me and how she wants to speak to me. Even if I apologize and take responsibility for what I did, or try to offer a opening for communication, she would continue. 

The only way she would stop is if it goes so far as to have me cry, and beg for some kind of communication, because it would get unbearable overtime. I always hate myself for it after, but I’m more relieved the silent treatment is over. 

When we argue she’s allowed to get as disrespectful and hurtful as she wants to. I’d open up to her about things she’d use against me. For example, I told her I was cheated on, and a week later we had gotten into an argument and she said “I’m not the one who cheated on you” and even though I was crying, she didn’t care. She has also called me many names both insulting and degrading. 

And when these things happen, sometimes she would apologize on her own, but 80% of the time I have to tell her why she should apologize and fight it out of her. She’s done other things but I won’t get into it. But I usually hold my tongue because I could never do these things if I was upset with her. 

Even when she isn’t angry, it gives me anxiety just when she’s around, when she calls, or when she texts. 

I partially blame myself honestly, for always forgiving her when she does these things for the sake of keeping the peace in the house. You teach people how to treat you by what you tolerate, so I partially blame myself. 

So sorry for this super long post, but... I don’t know if this is abuse or maybe I’m too sensitive. Please help. I’m so tired.",mystictwilight,2020-01-19 18:40:51,8,392,3.61,61.06,30.01,1,15.08,11.48,95.66,65.82,25.77,18.62,8.67,0.51,1.02,8.16,0.26,7.14,2.81,13.01,10.71,9.69,13.78,2.04,19.13,5.1,2.04,4.85,0.51,1.02,8.67,2.55,6.12,0.77,3.83,1.02,17.09,0.26,0,8.42,0,13.52,0.77,1.79,3.83,3.83,1.02,5.1,2.55,0.51,1.53,0.26,0.51,0.26,0.26,0,0,7.91,1.79,1.02,3.06,2.04,0.51,2.81,13.27,1.28,15.31,0.77,6.89,7.4,0.77,0,0.77,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.15,7.65,5.87,0,0,0.26,0,0,0.51,4.59,1.02,0.26
er7050,I don’t know if I’m being abused or not but people tell me I am.,"Sorry this is probably going to be a long one. 

Ever since I was very little my parents always say horrible things to me that I always assumed was normal. They gave me weird punishments like putting me in a tiny empty room for 3 days straight whenever I got a call home from school from k-3rd grade. They never locked the door. Sheer fear kept me in. When I pissed my mom off once when I was around 7, she threw my favorite stuffed animal out the car window and never went back for it. Both my parents spanked me a lot and still do. I’m 14 and female. About a year ago, I was going through severe depression and started cutting. When my parents found out, they basically destroyed my life. I came home from school that day and my mom looked insane from rage. She took my bedroom and bathroom doors away, and kept me up until past 1 in the morning hitting me, yelling at me, and making me do chores. She took away all my electronics and ravaged my room. She made me take my clothes off and took pictures of my scars. Told me I couldn’t have food. The chores/hitting/screaming until past midnight went on every night for at least a month before she let up a bit. A few days after it started, she asked me if I didn’t like her ways. She asked me if I wanted it to stop. I said yes. She left and came back a few minutes later with a knife and handed it to me. Told me that I had 2 easy options to solve my problem. Kill her, or myself. She held her wrists out to me, tears running down her cheeks, and told me to do it. Pick one. I said no and she told me to kill myself many times over the course of a few weeks. The only reason I didn’t was because she told me to do it and doing it would lead to her victory. I had to learn how to emotionally manipulate and lie to get my life back. It took me ten months before it was ok again. She never mentions the events of last year anymore. I have severe memory blanks now and usually can’t remember anything from that time. No one believed me at school when I told them why my eyes were puffy and I was bruised.  I suffered for 10 months in complete silence. Nowadays, my mom says little horrible things to me every day that my brain just blanks out. I try to write them down sometimes and some things she’s said/done the last few days are threatening to sell me for a maclaren (idk how you spell that one fancy car), try to drag me into a pool for splashing her and ending up giving me a large bleeding wound on my arm from scraping along the pool deck and then ignoring me and not apologizing or admitting she did it. She randomly insults me or hits me for things I’ve done in her dreams, or just to get back at me for stuff other people have done to her. She painfully compares me to other people and doesn’t notice or care when I cry because of it. But the reason I’m unsure if this is abuse or not is because both my parents spend a lot of money on me. They buy me expensive music equipment for making songs and such. Recently they bought me a brand new MacBook Pro and paid over $1000 for it (I paid $650). They take me on expensive luxury vacations but insult me most of the time we’re there. They take me out to eat all the time and buy me expensive fancy food. My dad spends a lot of money maintaining my 125 and 20 gallon aquariums. Every time after they insult me they hug me and cuddle me and tell me they love me and I’m their wonderful daughter and I will be so successful and rich one day. Every time after they say the nice stuff, I immediately forgive them and my brain blocks out the memories of the bad things. I don’t feel like I’m being abused most of the time and I feel like I’m not allowed to complain about anything because they just bought me an awesome computer. I feel numb a lot and people tell me I look like an emotionless zombie. My voice is deadpan and monotone. I can’t feel emotions like regret, and I have a hard time empathizing and socializing properly even though I try really hard. Recently a friend asked me if everything was ok and I just spilled everything. He said it’s abuse but I don’t know. I feel like I’m a horrible person too because I’ve said and done some pretty nasty stuff in retaliation. I’ve told my parents I want them to die during one of the huge shit fights and I called them disgusting people and said I was going to call the police. I was kicked out of the house for about half an hour. It was raining and 40 degrees out and I didn’t have shoes or a jacket on. Earlier today I was told to get out because I didn’t want to share my food with my sister. He insisted I had to share even though there was a lot more food available that she could have. He wanted me to give her my food in particular. I wasn’t kicked out but I was thrashed and had to give my food up. I have major food insecurities because my mom left the country for three months once and I was left with my dad who didn’t feed me and told me to fuck off almost every day. I lost about 10 pounds and was severely malnourished then. This was November-January so I was hungry during all the holidays including my birthday. When my mom got home she and my dad fought about how neglected I was and cuddled me for a long time. I have serious separation anxiety with my phone because my mom knows I like it and takes it away from me all the time. Threw it out the second story window once in the rain and it survived. 

My parents tend to switch out who’s nice and who’s the enemy every month or two. About once a year my mom has a month long breakdown and targets one person in the family (usually my dad) and threatens to leave and says horrible things to him. It’s a hard time for all of us. But even as I write this and you are probably thinking, “what the fuck this is totally abuse” I don’t really feel that way most of the time. Like right now, I’m perfectly calm and happy with my parents. My mindset switched during he shit fights and switches back after they apologize. Both my parents were abused as kids and tell me to be glad that I’m not treated as bad as they were. 

Please tell me your opinions on this. I think I might have ptsd from my experiences last year because I dissociate a lot and have panic/anxiety attacks sometimes. I have all of the other symptoms too. I don’t know what to do. As bad as they seem, I miss them like hell when I’m separated for more than a month or two. I just want them to stop saying the horrible things to me all the time and let me have my food to myself. I can’t involve cps or the police because my mom told me that if I ever called the police on her then I was no longer her daughter and had to find someone who would tolerate my nastiness. Please tell me what I should do.

Also thank you so much for reading this to the end. I’m sorry it was so long.

er8ze3,I don't know if getting someone of abuse should be on me.,"Hello, this will probably be very long but please take the time to read through and help. I(22F) have absolutely no idea how to deal with this and would love the input. I have to say though, I am not comfortable going in detail about my abuse. Infact I will be just barely mentioning it and will just term it as ""abuse"". If you absolutely need more details to understand I can try to elaborate more, but I will never be comfortable going into elaborate detail about what happened. 

I was with someone(25M) who was, in short, very abusive. (When I met him I was around 19 and he was 22). By the time I realised and cut ties with him he was diagnosed with BPD. Which I understand can be extremely difficult and some part of me does sympathize. But this person has inflicted so much abuse on me that I can never have a soft spot for him. I still sometimes have panic attacks for apparently no reason just to discover that there was a trigger tied to a suppressed memory. And my way of dealing has been completely cutting ties. My life has gotten much much better and I am so glad I made that decision. However, when I had realised he was a bad person and started to distance myself he started dating someone else(25F). Throughout our relationship he cheated, but this was different as this  person basically started to live with us. I did not have much interaction with her. I was not exactly jealous but I somehow saw her as his ""accomplice"". Basically she seemed to enjoy when he was ""bad"" to me and I felt like she had more power over him than him on her. A couple months ago I found out through a mutual person that this was not true. She is and has always been severely depressed and has attempted suicide multiple times. He manipulates her into making her believe that she is the problem in their life and if only she was happier with alllllll the effort he made, they would be much better. She has cut all contact from her parents and friends, because he made her do it. She now regularly self harms and infact he actually gets angry if the reason is anything but him! As if to say, you have no right to feel any emotion not related to me. I obviously felt very bad for her but there was nothing I could really do. Recently I ran into this mutual person once more and they expressed disappointed in  me for not doing more. They said that the only reason they told me was because I went through the same thing and they expected me to basically save her from the situation. Now, my first reaction was anger. How dare he bring my past. The past that I do so much to forget and actually try to relate it to something else. He has absolutely no right to do any such thing. I was for a while very very angry. After calming down however, I began to think, what if he's right? Should i have done more. Should i be helping her? She's just as helpless as I was and I was fortunate enough to leave. I really need input on this. Basically to understand if it is something I should get myself into.

I also what to add, I am in no way ""ok"" now. I left the situation but the effects are still there. There are days in a row where I don't even want to get out of bed. I don't feel anything at all. Not even hunger. No passion, no interests. Weirdly not even hurt. I force myself to eat though because I know I have to. I feel like it is not my ""responsibility"" to help her but my body and my mental health are. And I am thankfully in a place where I now understand that I owe to myself to do anything I can to pretect me. But I know without a doubt, that going back there in that situation or any trigger about my past will mess me up.

era7sd,"After 10 years, my abusive father has resurfaced through a facebook message.","My father was sexually abusive, and I only told my sister about it relatively recently. She had told my mother without my permission, and I feel that I have lost a lot of my trust of her. My father had hid where he was for years and had not been searchable because he owes thousands in child support. 

The last time I saw him was on my 11th birthday in a court mandated counseling center. It ended abruptly when my sister had left and I had expressed that he was abusive, and I have never spoken to him since. 

I have not been able to find him at all over all this time, and I have always been extremely curious (in the hopes I could make him pay, or mostly to find out if he has died???)  and suddenly he messaged me over my facebook. He hasn't posted anything in years and suddenly he updates his status and sends me a message?

I do not know what to think. I always tried to find him, not actually thinking that anything would come of it, and suddenly he shows up in my inbox, and I honestly didn't want that to happen.

I am terrified that he will find me in person, that is the last thing I want. I also am scared that he is reaching out for some horrible reason, and I do not know if I should tell my family about it. I dont know what I was trying to find by constantly searching him online, but now that I found him, I wish I left everything alone.

I am genuinely worried that he has suddenly resurfaced, and I do not know if I want to tell my family because I do not want to press charges or go through the intensity of the legal system within this situation.

There are moments like these where I can confidently say that. I know it's true. I see it every day, others have seen it and can confirm it, I can watch video evidence of it happening, etc. I understand objective reality. I can perceive the truth through a critical lens of fact and opinion. I know what is emotional and what is practical. I can distinguish between what is rational and what is not.

Then there are the times when I absolutely lose it.

It's like I become a computer program. All I know how to do is execute the orders of my abusers, and I will do whatever action necessary to do what they want. The lengths I have gone to justify their abuse to myself is horrifying. It's horrifying to know that this can happen to me, but it does. Consistently. All the time.

I have tried to break this cycle hundreds of times. I've tried to run away, get emancipated, contact DCF, tell a teacher/professor or school counselor, etc. Each of the aforementioned things have been done at least three times each, and there are more things I've tried once or twice. Everything has failed because I have always fallen back into a period of mindless justification.

I don't know how to escape this ruthless cycle. I feel like I have a parasite that periodically takes over my brain, and it's my parents' amazing skill at manipulating me into complete and utter obedience. I am terrified of what my life will be if I never escape this nightmare. I've already spent my life so far living in this hell, and I have three suicide attempts to my name as a result.

I am so desperate and exhausted that I've taken to scouring social media for some sort of solution. None of the years of internet research I've done has actually worked, but maybe someone will have some sort of special trick or secret. I don't know. I've tried absolutely everything else, and I can't give up now. There has to be hope for me, right?

Thank you to all those who read this, whether you can help or not. I appreciate it.",-Runaway_Throwaway-,2020-01-20 01:16:14,1,443,15.79,12.48,89.93,7.51,11.66,18.06,93.45,59.37,21.9,13.09,11.51,0,0.68,0,0.9,8.8,3.84,10.84,14,4.74,7,2.03,20.32,3.84,1.58,3.16,1.35,2.71,5.64,2.03,3.61,0.45,1.81,0.68,5.64,0.45,0.23,0,0,16.48,4.06,2.71,0.9,3.61,3.61,4.06,1.58,0.9,0.23,0.23,1.81,0.23,1.35,0.23,0,7.45,0.9,2.48,3.39,1.13,1.13,3.16,18.51,1.35,9.93,1.35,2.93,5.64,3.39,0.23,0,0.45,0.23,0.23,0.9,0.23,0,0.45,0,0,17.61,8.35,4.51,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,3.84,0.45,0.23

erbk3u,Not sure if I was abused during childhood,"Hi! For the last 3-4 years I’ve (19f) been having doubts about if I was sexually abused in my childhood. When I was in middle of high school I remembered tongue kissing my father at the age 6 or 7 when I first tongue kissed my first boyfriend. The memory was immediate and I got pretty confused by it. Didn’t know if it was normal since I always remembered kissing my father lightly and quickly in the lips. But this was different. This kiss lasted, my father was lying in bed without shirt and I was over him kissing him with tongue.

By that time I was depressed and got worse because the memory. I was told by my psychiatrist to treat my depression before handling the matter and eventually I buried the memory. Ever since I have tried not to think about it but as the time passes, the more I think it wasn’t right. 

Other things have come to my attention like I feel I had very promiscuous behavior ( before age 5) I also don’t know if this is normal for children to do but I would rub my genitals with objects and I remember playing house wife with other kids same age and tried kissing them on the mouth then see if they kissed me back. This happened only three times. I then grew up and felt guilty about masturbating. And not so long ago, my dad confessed to me that his older brother touched him when he was a child. 

Now I have issues with self esteem and depression. I also feel very related to BPD but haven’t been diagnosed and I’m sorting this issue out. Sometimes when Im having sexual relations with my boyfriend some touches just don’t feel right, I get sad and I don’t know why. At first it was very difficult for me to have sex without feeling dirty and sad.

I really want to get better with my mental health and disorders but if I don’t know what really happened and why I feel so confused I can’t move forward. I just want to know if this might likely be sexual abuse.

I can suffice, I have roommates and we are all contributing. I have $17k in the bank, I receive $2k monthly from SSI (only for a little bit), I work a part time job that brings in $700-800 a month. My friend has EBT, and we already have all of our furniture purchased. We have sat down and made a budget sheet. It’s all set and stone, and I couldn’t be more excited.

My mother hasn’t been the most temper-controlled person. I remember being screamed at for very minuscule things, and to this day this has stuck with me. If I spill something on the floor, I get very panicky and make sure to clean it up quickly. My mother always used to freak out about things like that.

I somewhat came out to my mom in 9th grade, and she took me on a car ride to essentially shame me into going back to liking just the opposite gender. She criticized me and told me I should be ashamed of myself and that “decision” that I came to.

My mother also has never let me leave my house and if she does, it’s for MAYBE an hour. She does this so she doesn’t have to worry about me and can just relax on her couch and do her own thing.

erheqk,How to heal after abuse with him?,"Hi everyone. This is going to be rough but I need advice badly. I am a 22F dating a 19M. We have been dating for two years now. Our relationship has always been rocky and its because of me most of the time. I cheated on him more times than I can remember. I punched him in the mouth so badly that he needed to have oral surgery. And I kicked him in the testicles so hard he had to go to the ER and they almost removed a testicle. Since then, I have gotten sober from methamphetamine and dedicated my life to helping others who have survived domestic abuse.

What I am struggling with is how to I heal from all this? I am left with so much guilt over what happened that it cripples me on a daily basis. Seeing how my boyfriend has stuck with me all this time and forgives me for everything is incredible, but I feel so guilty over what I did to him.

I'm currently in therapy and my therapist suggests that my boyfriend join our sessions, but my boyfriend says he is ""okay"" and doesn't need to go. I have offered to pay but he still refuses. He does have his own therapist, but his therapist does not do couples sessions.

Are there any other former abusers who can maybe share their experiences? Thanks everyone &lt;3

TLDR: I abused my boyfriend for two years and finally got sober.

Is this abuse?

Is this abuse?

I am not sure if this is a crime or this is abuse. With few people to talk to, I rely on your judgement. 
I am 22 years old Male, and when I was 19 my alcoholic father passed away. He was always a good man to me. Immediately after my mother and seven years older sister began being hostile and agresssive with me. They made me feel guilty for my dads death and that I didn’t deserve to get into a good university which was my way out, making my sister jealous. 
- They began forcing me to sleep with my mother and one night she put her hand on my stomach and I felt uncomfortable and pushed her hand away and then she placed her hand back on me. The atmosphere was strange and it was like she was going to have sex with me and I felt paralysed. Nothing happened. 
- They began forcing me to drink alcohol on many occasions against my consent. 
- They ultimately forced me to work in a bar serving drunks all summer as some punishment, against my consent. They were relentless and aggressive in making this happen. My sisters friend is a bar manager and my sister would come in to work to ensure I had not left. 
- I got into a good uni so I thought this would end, but it continued and continued and now I just want your help or guidance. 
- My mother didn’t support me getting help from my uni in the first semester refusing proof of my dads death so they could help me.
- My mother did not support me living in a flat with friends and instead isolating me by putting me in a one-bed flat that is free to live in as it was purchased with my dads apartment money from his death. 
- Lonely in the flat, I bought a rope for attention to wake my mother up and have heart-to-heart and feel compassion. She did the opposite and forced me to go the GP and forced her way into the meeting against my consent, and forced the NHS to provide a service called IHTT which administers drugs to people at home, despite the GP being very surprised at IHTT being offered and reassuring my mother  that I am fine and not to interfere I was 20 at the time.
This is where my story gets worse and I became a victim of institutionalism of psychiatry and my mother in collusion with the doctor forced drugs on my against my consent for a year, drugging me out of university for a year and traumatising me with myofaschial pain. She beat me, shouted at me and made feel guilty for my dads death. I bought her £500 worth of Christmas presents under the subordination I was in and to make her stop. She treats my sister like a goddess. 


The GOOD. (This is relatively recent)
- my mother recently put in money for a new laptop
-  my mother funded a summer school as I couldn’t live with her and the damage it did to my career 
- My mother funds my therapy

es0vou,what will happen if I tell my therapist about my abuse? :( (+advice please),my mom recently has been more verbally abusive than usual and i have therapy today. I really want to tell her but im so scared of my mom. If nothing happens i know she will be SO mad. But it's getting bad. she constantly checks my grades since she doesn't have a job and if a grade slips or im missing something she comes into my room screaming. She also will constantly email my teachers to make sure im turning things in when i do??  Im not sure how im supposed to explain this to my therapist buts hes just been like making my depression and self harm not a big deal? its really weird but she says im doing it for attention or im just trying not to get better. when she says this its pretty intimidating but idk if its abuse. I'm not sure what to do. theres so much more she does but it would take forever.

es3b0i,I'm falling back into a hole from my past sexually abusive trauma and some of my friends are the cause. NSFW?,"So this is my first time posting on this sub but I just found the urge to put what I've been going through these past few days out so I can atleast try to help myself. 

I am currently a 17 year old girl, weeks from being 18, but when I was 16 I was manipulated by an older man. He was 10 years older than me and I was in a dark place and he took advantage of me over months and used me. I've dealt with it the best I could but recently it's been popping back up. 

On another post I made I talk about what happened to me but I don't want to have to go into detail about it again on this post so if you want more information look at my other posts or I'll try my best to answer anything bellow in the comments. 

Basically I've had alot of stress these past few weeks, I had to not only apply for University with the deadline the other day but my dad ended up walking out on us and disapearing without any contact for over a week. It pushed me back as I was already stressed out with other things but I feel that it's made me more fragile overall and has stopped me thinking straight. 

Now in comparison to Every thing this will sound so insignificant but a friend of mine at college keeps bringing up wanting me to bring in my DS again after I brought it in the other day to keep myself entertained and he was amazed to see me playing one. All he wanted was to play some multiplayer games together and apparently kick my ass in all of them. It's a simple request but I didn't feel up for it at all this morning. So when I got in even though I had my DS when he brought it up I just said I didn't feel like it at all right now. I didn't want to seem rude as he's a good friend but not even half an hour later he asked again. This time I told him I just didn't want to play today, and that just I'd bring it in tomorrow if I can. At this point I wasn't that bothered but it ended up that through maybe the next 2 hours he'd asked me 20+ times and it was starting to stress me out. I had straight up told him no, I really don't want to play at all today in an extremely forward way that you couldn't take as not meaning what I meant, but he kept asking. He would ask me every second he got and I was just becoming so anxious and stressed and it was making me feel sick and claustrophobic. He was just blatantly ignoring me saying no constantly and it was just making me feel in the same powerless situation when I was with the older guy, how he would keep asking me stuff until I just wouldnt seem against it and go ahead, or just completly ignore me saying no in every way shape or form. I've not reacted this was at all before to something like this happening but it really hit me this time. Every time he asked me today I was getting more nervous and more angry and just every emotion was building up.

He also asked me if when I see a girl getting violently raped do I feel it after him and a friend were talking about how when they see another guy getting kicked in the balls they feel it too. It was an out of place stupid joke but with how I was feeling I wanted to just tell him how badly saying something like that could affect someone if they've had bad experiences. The hard thing is I have to work with him for the rest of the year so I cant just ignore him, and then also he has no clue I've had the experience I had. I dont want to bring it up to him and tell him about it as it could then spread around but I need to get him to realise he needs to stop. 

Before any of this happened today I searched Sexual abuse helplines on my phone but wasn't able to get myself to ring any. My boyfriend is the only person who knows what I've actually gone through and he's been trying to get me to go to counselling or the police but I don't want to have to relive it or risk my family and friends finding out so that's why I've turned to trying a helpline. When my dad was missing my mum called one and she told me how much it helped her in so many ways and since then I've wanted to try using one to help me with this but I feel that I don't know what one would be suitable. I'm from the UK and it would need to be free but I havnt had a chance to find one yet.

I honestly don't know what the aim of this was at the start but it was more go get things off my chest. It's so shittily written as Ive just rushed it before passing out in bed tonight but I wanted to get it off my chest even if it is kinda stupid. I apologise again for any gramatial and spelling errors as I'm tired as fuck rn and will hopefully go through and sort some out tomorrow morning.",Issues-throwaway,2020-01-21 15:43:33,1,955,17.31,15.23,92.23,9.18,29.84,11.31,95.71,63.25,22.72,14.76,10.99,0.1,0.21,3.04,0.42,7.96,3.66,14.87,10.16,7.33,9.95,2.51,22.51,4.61,3.14,2.09,1.47,3.14,4.4,1.47,2.83,0.73,1.15,0.1,8.69,0.42,0.94,0.52,3.46,16.13,2.51,1.78,3.14,3.77,1.36,5.45,2.72,0.63,0.73,1.15,1.05,0.42,0.21,0.42,0,6.07,1.26,1.36,2.2,1.68,0.42,8.27,11.2,1.26,16.75,2.2,6.91,7.96,0.84,0.84,0.21,0.1,0,0,0.52,0.31,0.21,0,0,0,7.96,3.25,0.94,0,0,0.1,0,0,0,3.56,0,0.1

es4ki5,"I can’t tell if this is abuse or not, a reddit mod suggested I posted this here from R/relationships","Hey y’all, last night everything was fine between me and my GF, but she noticed I was upset about something and I started telling her I was really stressed out about life at the moment and how I was really not in a good place, I also added that I talked to my closest friends about some bdsm test thing and it was just a joke and I told her I thought it was weird and while I was telling her some other friend of hers told her a long ass thing about her brother and she got visibly upset and asked to go home, so I took her home and she wouldn’t tell me anything until she got out and said she was upset with me that I talked sexually to a girl, even though it was a group chat with my closest friends who one is a girl and other is a guy. (The girl is also in a committed 2 year long relationship) I’ve never even talked about anything sexual with her before and what’s a real kick in the dick is I just sent what I got on the test and then we all changed subject to something else. After she told me she was upset about that she said it was small and she’s fine and she feels that it’s a double standard and if she talked to a guy about that I’d be upset. 

I understand what she is saying but I also don’t get it because they are my closest friends, and she isn’t just some girl and my other guy friend is in there? I feel like she just projected her anger from whatever she was told on me and it Fucking sucks. I told her I still needed to vent to her and all she could do is tell me to type it couldn’t even call me or anything. I asked her if she was busy talking to her mom and nope she was just sitting around and she wasn’t even going to talk to her mom about her family issue. I eventually told her the rest of what I needed to vent and how I’m feeling suicidal about my life and my current issue and she didn’t even acknowledge it and just said “is that all you were gonna text me?” And then she said if you come over here We aren’t gonna talk I’m gonna just sleep and I told her that’s fine I just don’t want to be alone tonight and instead she says “then go talk to your friends about your sexual and kinky things and all the other stuff you wouldn’t feel comfortable about if I talked to a guy”. Like wtf and I got pissed and told her to let me in so I could grab my stuff (I was just angry at this point) I felt so disrespected and felt like such trash to her that she couldn’t reassure me or talk to me and instead of being nice decides to treat me like trash and blow something way out of proportion, like I understand she heard something bad but she even told me “it’s dumb”  so she just was upset and took her anger out on me. How is this cool??? What did I do wrong??? Is it even okay to disrespect my feelings like that. 

She also has sent multiple texts that come off as threats like “do this or else” “I’m going to block you on everything if you don’t stop” 

TLDR; Girlfriend asked if I was okay I said no, had a lot going on. She hears news her brother did something stupid she gets angry shifts all the anger towards me, doesn’t acknowledge my feelings expects me to shut up, threatens me and now I feel like shit.

 I couldn't concentrate at school as a result of everything going on at home. I would play truant a lot and frequently not attend school. I struggle very badly with depression and I have a lot of difficulty forming relationships and making friends because I had nobody to talk to about everything going on at home.

es6t17,I hate trauma triggers,"The obligatory: throwaway account because this is personal sensitive stuff. 
Background : my assaults both happened in consensual dating relationships ten years ago. In both cases I must have blocked them out so much, that I did not even realize they were assaults until 10 years later while seeing a therapist for unrelated issues. 

Current : I am in a very healthy, mutually respectful, happy, loving relationship. We both have abuse in our personal histories, and are both communicative about our pasts.

Getting into my issue today...
I discovered a few years ago that I can have trauma triggers that make me feel as if I was recently violated or abused. Just 2 nights ago another one occurred in the middle of a very intimate moment between me and my BF. It ended with me uncontrollably sobbing, confused, upset and depressed. I just want to get out how I’m feeling and this space seemed appropriate. Maybe it will help someone else not feel so alone as I do now.

I’m upset that these men, whom I trusted in my life, felt they had the power over me to take advantage of me and not respect my “no”. 
I am angry that I didn’t react the way I feel like reacting today - with anger and violence. I am so upset that I stayed in the situation I was in for several days after the incident. 
I’m pissed off that my body decided to not process this trauma in the moments, because now I feel like a lunatic. I feel like a hostage in my new healthy life to these trauma triggers that can jump out of nowhere and send me spiraling into doubt, confusion and pain. 
I hate that my BF thinks he did something wrong and is concerned about his actions. 
I hate that I’m overweight and likely keeping myself from being healthy as a means of protection. 
I’m angry that I feel so alone to process this. I want a cookie, and frosting, and whiskey, and weed, and Xanax, and sleep, and TV. I just want it to go away, yet I know that won’t solve anything. I just don’t want to deal with this anymore. It makes me feel weak. Unfeminine. Victimized. 

How do you heal these wounds? How do you recover?

es9jv8,Ex boyfriend abused me...,"Me and my ex had been together for 2 years, we both lived our own homes and see each other regularly for the first year, we had bad arguments in which he would be so cruel to me and tell me to die, tell me I’m better off dead, call me ugly etc.. he also smashed my mother’s front door up, but I forgive him and so did my family as he was “struggling” with mental health, he had also spat in my face several times before aswell. I’m 21 and he is 23, I’m 8 stone and 5”3 and he’s 25 stone and 6”4... you can imagine the size difference.


We then moved in together and within the first week we had an argument and he head butted me and it made me fall, it left me shocked and he came home and said it was a joke and he didn’t mean it to be hard I forgive him later that week he punched me in the day knocking me out, my lip was burst. I was so upset, I kicked him out and he said “kicking me out of my own home?” And smashed two of the main doors in the house of the hinges. I wanted him gone then, I rang his mum to come get him and take him away, we didn’t speak for a few days and he came back for some more stuff, he seen my lip and cried and then said “this is why I wish you didn’t make me so angry” I was shocked by this but as he was crying and upset I stupidly forgive him, then this Saturday he threw me against the wall leaving my whole back bruised and I took all my stuff and moved back in my with my parents, I haven’t had an apology, I’ve had messages from him saying “that’s why I ask you not to make me angry” “this wouldn’t happen if you would stop” I’ve never had ONE apology for hitting me, he’s never blamed himself it’s always been me. It scares me as I am so in love with this guy but surely this is worrying behaviour to not even apologise? I don’t want an apology anymore but I thought it would be expected behaviour. I am so upset the guy I love is a heartless monster, I can’t speak to any of my friends because I’m worried they will just gossip about it instead, I just want someone to talk to.. someone who wants to listen.

esgj99,Abuse from years ago [NSFW-ish] [underage abuse],"Marked as NSFW because it is about sexual abuse, I do not go into any details. It is also underage abuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many things happened in my life but the abuse I had will always be a part of me. Sometimes I need to talk about it. It's a monster inside of me that I need to tame here and there. It's hard to fully love and accept love at times..

When I was 10 years old, my mother decided she wanted me to live with her, previously I was always in boarding schools as both my parents were too busy to take care of me. My dad shortly after I started living there said he no longer wanted to see me, for many years I would only see him for holidays. 

So while living with my mom, she didn't have much time to take care of me and I think she only wanted the extra funds it would give her. She had a ""boyfriend"" whom didn't work and he was the one taking care of me. The first two years went by my mother ignoring me more and more not wanting to talk to me when she got back from work, and me hating her boyfriend. 

At 12 years old, I started to get insomniac, I was awake at odd hours and her boyfriend was always up. He was pretty much becoming my only friend as I didn't have much friends at school and I didn't have any parental love at that time. I am not sure how it went to that but he one day asked to see me shirtless in exchange of money. I ended up showing myself to him. Things escalated pretty quickly from there. I think within or week or two since the incident he was doing me on a daily basis. 

He used money, computer time, games, music just anything really that he could use to manipulate me. At the time, for me it was a form of love. Twisted and ugly but it is what I could get. School was getting worst I was bullied and started to miss more and more school days, my only friend I had, ignored me at school. So slowly I was only at home, being used by him. 

This lasted 4 years, at 16, my 4th year of high school I dropped out of school and my life was only shallow online relationships while he was using me. I remember that I had to wake him up while doing him some favors, I had to tell him that I loved him, he used me while I was on the computer chatting. 

The abuse got discovered because I had to attend a funeral and they wanted me to get time off school and learned that I wasn't going anymore. We tried to get the police involved but they said ""you are 16, you were consenting, it's useless to pursue in court"" that kind of thing when the man had a record that he might of abused of his sons some year prior. 

To this day I still don't understand why the police went on the defense to not do anything, my abuser went on to date my cousin right after all this happened and she is 2 years older then me. She never believed me that he used me, when to me just the fact that he dated her proves it. 

It may have happened 20 years ago now, but it is still part of me. I have regrets, I regret that I didn't push more so that he would of at least needed to face his actions to have broken this young girl so many years ago. I had other form of abuse after as I was a broken person and people didn't know how to handle me. I was this suicidal, self-harming edgy goth girl. I was pretty anti-social I had a hard time expression my emotions, or just expressing myself simply I was just so awkward and out there. 

Even if my parents tried to make me see people to make me feel better, I wasn't ready and very unwilling to get any form of help. And my mother was always making me lose my computer ""privilege"" so the rare friends I had... were gone. I was alone, pushed into a corner and I was fighting for my own survival. 

Since then I have evolved. I have been better, I did have bad manipulative relationships, scared of older people still, but I am better. My present relationship is very patient and works with me so that I handle things better and stop pushing away. So that's pretty much part of my story. Sometimes I feel it was my fault but manipulation especially on the young and impressionable ones really mess up perspective.",SansaMittens,2020-01-22 11:08:11,1,817,21.35,29.5,81.77,15.45,19,10.65,94.98,58.87,22.15,16.77,12,0.12,0.24,4.16,0.24,5.39,3.06,12.48,10.16,6,7.47,1.84,20.07,4.28,2.57,1.1,1.47,2.94,6.24,2.69,3.43,0.24,1.47,0.73,11.26,1.22,0.98,2.2,3.43,12.48,1.84,2.45,2.08,2.45,1.22,3.18,1.47,0.61,0.37,0.49,2.08,0.37,0.73,0.12,0.24,7.83,2.94,1.47,1.59,1.84,0.73,10.16,7.96,0.73,15.67,1.84,4.77,9.42,2.45,0.73,0.12,0.49,0,0.24,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,0,13.1,5.51,3.92,0,0.24,0,0,0.37,0.73,1.59,0,0.73
esk1cu,"I got called a ""lazy f*cker"" for forgetting to take out the trash.","*NSFW because of swearing*

This is a long one, but please read.

I was curious as to whether this is emotional abuse or not. My step dad doesn't hit me, and hasn't even touched me in a while (including no hugs), but he yells a LOT. For the littlest reasons. He also never lets me speak my mind or talk to him. And every time I try to talk to him about something about himself, he gets defensive.

If you could, I want you to please read through three stories that I'm about to tell, and tell me if yoy would consider my step dad emotionally abusive.

Story #1: One time I forgot to take out the trash bag ofnplastic bottles I had in my room, so he busted into my room without knocking and yelled at me, and also kicked the bag like a child with a pout on his face. He does this stuff all the time, as if I'm not a human who makes mistakes. 

Story #2: Recently, I took out the trash, but forgot a bag of bottles on the counter. When I went upstairs and put in my earbuds to listen to some music, he apparantly called me but I didn't hear him. So then he bust into my room screaming stuff like ""did you not fucking hear me!?"" and some more stuff I forgot, then on the way downstairs he yelled ""FUCK!"". 

Story #3: One morning I forgot to take the trash to the curb. He was understandably angry because I specifically said I WOULD take it out, but he overreacted. He was yelling, swearing. I took the can to the curb, and he followed me while he did it, an angry look on his face, yelling the whole time. I said ""sorry I'm a dissapointment"" and he yelled ""you're not a dissapointment, you're just a lazy fucker!"" And he continued to yell at me AND make me start sobbing while people were at my bus stop, listening.
He went back inside, but while taking the rest of the garbage to the curb I missed the bus. So I stood at the garage door waiting for someone to come outside so I could ask for a ride, and when my step dad opened the door he said, ""What the fuck are you doing here!?"" I said I missed the bus and he yelled, ""START WALKING!""

Bonus story: One time he lifted me under my armpits and slammed me into the wall. But that was one of the only times he's ever touched me.

So what do you think? Is this emotional abuse? I think it is because he makes me feel like shit. But does he have a right to be that angry? And he doesn't think I'm a disappointment, as you read, but he did call me a lazy fucker. So I'm just confused. Also he never says he loves me. To be fair, I don't say it either, but the parent should be the one to say it, right?

And he isn't always like this. He's nice to me sometimes! He takes me to my favorite places and feeds me. But the moment I do something he doesn't like too much, that's when it becomes hell.

I don't know. But please tell me what you think.

esm5zo,Ptsd?,"Hello, I'm very new here. But after a recent event I feel it may be best to talk with others who understand.

I was with a guy for 5 years, married for 1. When I finally broke it off is when I recognized the emotional abuse. It was hard as hell and I almost went back, but I did it!

While I was with him, he would yell.. a lot. It started as him raging at videogames and being irritable for a while afterwards. He'd slam his fists and yell and yet continue to play. Normally this was a game we played together. After a while, he started raging at me when we were playing. Then his anger carried out of the games. I can't recall exactly the chain of events, but I just remember he would get overly mad over something, yell and bang his fists and sometimes clench his fists and stand in a way to I think show how much stronger than me he is? And then at the end of it when he started calming down he'd tell me what I did wrong that made him get angry and I'd have to apologize.

At the beginning, I fought back and we had screaming matches where he'd threaten to leave but then tell me he only said it because he thought it's what I wanted. Later on I stopped fighting him.

I bring all of this up because I'm wondering if maybe I have ptsd but I'm nervous about getting help in case I don't. I've noticed that I'm constantly on watch for ppl who show any similar traits to my ex and I'm immediately afraid of them. When ppl get mad around me, I'm quick to assume responsibility for it and apologize and I become scared and confused the more they insist I haven't done anything wrong. Today I had a full on.. episode? I guess?? where a roommate woke up mad and sort of took his anger out by cleaning which involved some slamming and I apologized to him multiple times and had a full on breakdown in my room alone bawling my eyes out and shaking and my head hurts trying to figure out what I did wrong, because there's no way I didn't do something wrong.
(He apologized for scaring me btw)

Idk I'm kind of a mess and trying not to apologize again aha. Mostly it's like.. I analyze everyone in fear of them potentially being an abuser, I assume responsibility when someone is mad around me and breakdown from it sometimes, I have trouble remembering the abuse fully, I've developed these fatigue problems, and I have nightmares of ppl leaving me. Could this be ptsd? I'm afraid to go to a professional without hearing some other confirmation. I guess I'm afraid to waste their time and make them mad (more ptsd stuff maybe????)

Tldr; dated a guy who got mad and made me apologize for everything, plenty emotional abuse and appearing physically threatening. Wondering if I may have ptsd because I can't remember the abuse well, I assume responsiblity when ppl are mad, and I'm always afraid of meeting another abuser.",DragonsInHeaven2,2020-01-22 17:54:31,0,530,16.94,36.71,86.24,1,16.56,16.79,94.53,60.19,23.02,16.6,11.13,0.57,0,3.96,0.94,6.42,4.15,12.26,10.19,5.85,10,1.7,19.25,5.66,2.45,3.21,0.38,2.08,11.13,1.32,9.81,2.45,4.91,0.75,12.08,0.19,0.57,0,4.34,14.72,3.4,1.51,1.51,6.04,0.94,3.02,2.83,1.13,1.13,0.57,0.75,0.38,0.38,0,0,7.55,1.89,0.75,2.83,1.32,1.7,6.23,10,1.13,15.47,1.13,6.6,8.11,1.32,1.13,0.38,0,0.19,0,1.89,0.19,1.32,0,0.19,0.19,16.04,5.28,3.21,0,0.19,1.89,0.19,0,0,4.53,0.75,0

esogrj,For my father,"One thing I see all over the internet is that people allow their families to be toxic and sabotage them. And they allow it because they are family. Those of you who I have allowed to be on my page know my name used to be different. Soon my name will be changed legally and I will no longer wear the Mielech name and will form my own family. My father and my sister chose their path and since they have done that they will no longer be in my life. The only two immediate family members (besides my cousins and aunts and uncles) will be my brother and my mother. I no longer have a sister or a father. My official new name is Kallum Joel Fontaine. The before mentioned family members have been informed that they can try to contact me (as I was either there for them before or I suffered their abuse) and they can decide to make an attempt. I can give a shit less. This is just a declaration that regardless if they are family or not, if they are toxic, then remove them from your life. It can be done. And it’s funny because they used their scapegoat as my therapy and my therapy told me to remove them from my life. 

As I told you the day you held me by my throat against my computer for not giving you my only lightbulb in my room; “punch me in the face you fucking cocksucker”. 


Fuck you. Take accountability you piece of shit. Fuck you. I will never ever speak to you again. I hope you see this. I hope you see this and see what the fuck you did and what you created and I hope you can’t fucking live with it. 

You’ve ruined every fucking family vacation. Every I love you. Every fucking moment of sincerity with your abuse and you’re fucking refusal to take any accountability for what you did.

esu2ft,Left abusive situation,"So almost 2 weeks ago I made a post on here about my abusive grandmother in law. She is rude and rabts and raves on us. 

Just the other day we were playing with pur daughter she is 4 and she started yelling and called my fiance and I both a piece of shit cause we were not paying attention to her instead. She told us she wanted us to move our tv into our room and hers into the livingroom. So thats what we started doing and she got mad and started calling us assholes and worthless. She told us to get out 3 times. 

So we packed up our stuff and took what we can. She kept saying she was gonna change the locks so that we couldnt get back in. Which I told her she legally cant keep us from getting our stuff. Now we are at my dads and Its nice not being yelled at but its so small and cramped and neither one of us have a job. I have a job interview coming up but not till next week. 

Anyways I am happy to be out if that abuseive situation.

He was throwing everything he thought was bad about me around like venom and god it was everything about me, so I said I'll be out of your hair soon and he took that as me saying I'll move in with my close family friends and he went ballistic, saying he'll go onna killing spree and no one would be left standing, and he strongly implied he's killed other people in the past. I'm so fucking scared of him and I'm stuck in this situation, I had a complete panic attack mixed with a breakdown after he said that and he was telling me I was the psychotic one and how I need to be put in an institution but I was just scared for my loved ones lives because of his anger. My mom did absolutely nothing about this and can't even see how this is wrong and I feel scarred and traumatized. Maybe I am the dramatic one here but God I don't know what to do.

esw5kz,Feeling like I have to uproot my life,"I had a friend who I used to play DnD with and I found it so cathartic. It was fucking liberating to be able to just literally be whatever the hell I wanted around another person without being judged. However our game time has been interrupted by the person who got me into the game in the first place.

It sounds dramatic, but he was my only other friend, and he has turned out to be verbally/covert abusive toward me. Every time we hung out he would do weird things like insult me under his breath, make disgusted faces at me or mouth FU to me. Didn't make any sense. He knows everything about me and it's a small town. I feel like it will be hard to avoid him now because he might be at another DnD campaign in town since there aren't that many, and he would definitely be at the same mental health clinic where we met.

He was my only friend I felt comfortable enough to play this game with. I have really bad social anxiety from past trauma, and it's hard for me to open up to people. We had amazing times together and I don't know if I will ever find another gamer who's characters mesh the ways ours did. It's devastating and frustratingly complicated. This is a double-layer-cake relationship problem. Our characters were fine together but we ourselves were not. I'm afraid no one would want to have my character in their campaign for DnD-either they wouldn't like me, or they wouldn't like my character.",Previous-Jellyfish,2020-01-23 09:16:48,2,274,17.67,51.46,51.12,2.73,17.12,14.6,94.53,61.68,23.36,16.06,8.76,2.92,0,3.28,1.09,7.3,3.28,13.14,13.87,4.74,5.47,2.92,20.07,4.74,1.82,1.82,1.09,2.92,8.39,2.92,5.47,1.09,2.19,0.36,14.96,0,1.09,0,3.28,14.96,3.28,1.82,3.28,1.82,1.46,4.74,2.55,0,0.36,1.82,2.92,1.09,1.09,0.36,0.36,11.68,7.3,0.73,2.19,0.36,1.09,6.57,10.58,1.09,10.95,0.36,7.66,2.92,0,3.65,0,0,0.36,0,1.09,1.09,0.36,0,0,0,13.5,5.47,2.19,0,0,0,0,1.09,0,4.38,0,0.36
esxju3,Is this considered abuse??? Or is this just a weird request?,"So my ex who was very emotionally and mentally abductor towards me would always demand to check my panties and my vagina when I refused to have sex with him? I always would tell him I was on my period and he would get defensive and say “Let me check...” Is this normal? Do a lot of boyfriends typically do this? Forgive me if I seem dense but I haven’t had many experience with guys and dating in general. 

 Now admittedly I lied to him... but it was because I didn’t feel safe nor comfortable with him. He tried to have unprotected sex with me numerous times even though he was cheating on me and I didn’t want to risk anything. He would get me so intimidated and I would fess your and say “I’m lying.” He would give me the coldest stare and say “Why would you lie to me?” Upon refusal of sex he would give me the silent treatment and tell me that I really don’t love him because if I loved him I would have sex with him. Is this abuse or just manipulation? This never seemed right to me... he always knew I was uncomfortable about sex (virgin) and he would tell me we were going places to do non-sexual activities and in reality he would take me to places to try and have sex. I felt to naive in these situations.

esxyoj,I can't tell if I'm imagining this,"I'm looking back on my marriage, which I'm about to finalise the divorce for, and it's bringing back a lot of feelings. My ex never hit me, he supported me, he encouraged me. But it feels as though he did all these things for me, just to make me feel bad about it. He would act as though I was ungrateful and that he had to do all these things because otherwise I'd be upset at him. Which isn't true at all. I'm scared that I'm a terrible person and that he's right. He has a lot of depression and suicidal thoughts as well. The sort of examples I feel might be abusive are he would say he hated his birthday and didn't want to do anything or have anything. Then when I listened to that he was upset that I didn't get him anything or do anything. I'm autistic so I might be misunderstanding. 

He would be all enthusiastic about buying me a laptop, he'd get me to tell him what I wanted in terms of spec, then after it arrived he would, for months, go on about how he didn't have a laptop. I would say why don't you buy one, but he wouldn't because he didn't deserve one or some excuse. So I'd feel really bad. If I didn't give him enough affection he would say I didn't fancy him or that I was ignoring him. He wanted me to jump up as soon as he came home from work and be all happy, otherwise he would say I wasn't bothered. I didn't have a job, because of my own issues, and I struggle with domestic tasks in the home. He worked full time and would cook dinner for us. So I feel like I'm a jerk. When he was working too much and came home really depressed every day, I tried to get him to quit, but he said he had to do it because I wanted nice things.   


I wanted to go to conventions but he refused. So I started going on my own. Then he would message/call me through the weekend saying how terrible he felt. It made it so that I couldn't enjoy it. So I got him to come along (after some intense begging) and then he would just flirt with everyone else and ignore me. He would act really happy to see our friends then we'd go back to the hotel room and he'd be miserable again. 

I found myself feeling so deflated and miserable. I felt trapped in the relationship because I didn't have my own money. But eventually I was able to leave and I sort of expected him to be happy, since he seemed so miserable with me. He wasn't though. He got very suicidal, disappeared overnight and spent 5k of our money. When I suggested we quick divorce using unreasonable behaviour he went on about how unreasonable I was to be with. He's always been difficult to deal with as it feels like he gets upset very quickly. But then he accuses me of being unreasonable. 

After we split I had this weird feeling that he was going to kill me. It felt like he was really mad that I, who is a piece of sh\*&amp;, could leave him after all he's done. He's settled down now though as he has a new gf (he said he would never love anyone ever again because I was his soulmate). I hold back in arguments though because I don't want to push him over the edge where he kills himself or something. I feel like I've never been able to say how I feel for fear of upsetting him

He still says things at me, like I went to see Star Wars and he was like 'I doubt I'll be able to see it as I don't have free time'. It feels like everything is a guilt trip.

esy0ap,Didn’t know where else to post this,"Hello, I’m (18f) alone with my brother (15) quite a lot as my parents work late one week out of three. We get into the normal sibling arguments but nothing like this- is this abuse? And if it is, my parents won’t do anything as they’re not there what do I do? I move to university in September. 

My brother was making dinner tonight as we take it in turns when parents aren’t home. I’m supposed to take the bins out tonight and was going to do it later because it’s freezing cold inside and outside the house and I was waiting for the heating to turn on before I went outside to do it. When he called me done for dinner he told me to get the bins out and I refused for the above reason. He told me he wasn’t going to let me get my dinner until I did my chores and I tried to reach past him to get my plate. 

So he slapped me. 

We got into a bit of a fight and he physically harmed me quite a few times. I’d like to make it clear that despite being older than him he’s nearly 6 foot and I’m only 5”5. He also does a lot of sports clubs despite being quite thin and I’m a decently weak individual. There were several punches to my stomach involved and it left me feeling sick. 

He hasn’t been like this since he was an angry 12 year old and back then I could handle his emotional outbursts as he couldn’t actually hurt me. 

I thought about calling the police but felt it would be a he said she said scenario as there were no serious physical injuries but I’ve been crying in my room for an hour and I’m still there. 

Of course he’s always been cruel and insulting verbally, especially about my appearance and weight (which certainly didn’t help the eating disorder I’ve recovered from fairly recently but he didn’t know about that) but never like this nor this bad.

We were parked in the middle of nowhere and he was on top of me. It started out fine, but sometimes it took a long time for him to finish. And sometimes it hurts when I have sex. He stopped every other time. I said it hurt. I asked him to stop, but he just kept going until he came. It felt like he liked it, but he looked almost angry. Is it weird that I think that? I wanted a break from sex aftwerwards. It was like he was oblivious to all of it. Eventually he broke up with me and was a complete jerk. I was stupid and mad and decided to tell his girlfriend what he did. I told her he made me have sex, but she took his side. Anyway, we're out of high school now, but he's emailing me, calling me a liar, saying he never did anyhing wrong. I told my boyfriend and another friend who came to my defense and now he's emailing them telling them i'm a liar and manipulative and a cheater. The truth is I""m not a good person. he's not wrong, but what HE DID was WRONG too. Am I crazy? Is this crazy? What the f this guy doing? Does he not remember? Does he not believe me? It's been too long. Do I have a case? I have no evidence. What about what he's doing online now? It's cyber bullying. Can I go after him for that? People seriously are taking his side!!! Please ....any input or advice...thank you...the worst part is I can't totally blame people for believing him because i do lie all the time for no reason. I exaggerated what he did to my boyfriend who now doubts me. And now I""m freaked out. Would it be weird to just tell his girlfriend I made it up? would he leave me alone if I just took it back? Am I overreacting? Is it fair to call what happened to me rape? I just want him to leave me alone, but I feel like I can't do anything. Someone said he sounds like a psychopath. Does he based on what I've said? And why do I feel so guilty? And like maybe I deserved it? Maybe if I'd just let him finish. Ugh, it makes my skin crawl to admit that.

et3gmp,"My abusers girlfriend is in the same class as me, any advice","I'm 21 (female) I'm in college and I graduate in The Fall 2020. Two years ago I got out of my emotional and physical abuse and I still get anxiety every time I go on campus and two years ago one of my friends help me report him to campus police and they gave him a warning that if he ever harassed men again he'll be expelled from college. I aslo hid a secret from my parents and campus police that I was rapped by him during our relationship multiple times and during those times I got pregnant and ended up miscarrying, the week before  this semester started my uncle was yelling and screaming at me holding me down due to my outbursts of anxiety in which I kept saying get off me multiple times ( he always does this when I have those outbursts and it reminds me what my ex did to me) and everything came out I told them about the rape and I know it's way to late to do anything since time passed, my sister started crying because she felt like it was her fault that she couldn't protect me but I never intended to make her feel that way and I feel horrible she felt that way I  constantly apologized to them that I let it happened to me, they were all in shock and speechless and I told them it was why I had a pap smear done because  the doctor recommended it for HPV Screening. The only person I told two years ago  was a former friend but she told everyone and started telling everyone including his new girlfriend that I lied ""because I was bitter about it"" to which  I didn't know he had started dating this was before he was reported to campus police and I didn't report the rape because I felt discouraged from what everyone was saying about me, I ended up staying silent for two years about it, I'm crying right now because it's something that I held in and stayed quiet about  it for two years. Now since the semester started and I happened to have the same class with my ex's girlfriend  and I don't know what to do if she comes up to me about it or try and start things, I happened  to notice we look similar and dress the same, is ther any advice how to handle it if she does confront me about it I makes me scared I noticed on the first week of class that she kept staring at me me and it makes my anxiety go up",chesiatulamiatela,2020-01-23 17:57:39,2,450,23.88,40.34,91.75,1,75,14.89,96.67,60.22,27.11,18.22,12.89,0.44,0,3.78,1.11,8.89,3.33,13.56,7.33,4,8.22,1.11,19.56,4,2,1.78,2,1.33,4.89,0,4.89,1.11,2,0.67,12.89,0.89,1.11,2.44,2.44,10.44,2.44,2.89,0.89,2,2,1.78,3.33,0.44,1.56,1.11,1.56,0,1.11,0.67,0,7.11,2.67,0.44,2.44,0.89,0.89,10.67,7.56,0.22,16.89,1.78,5.33,10.22,4.22,0,0,0,0,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,6.44,0.89,1.78,0,0,0,0,0,0.44,2.44,0.89,0
et3z32,Did she assault him or was it self defense?,"Live in Florida. Never posted here before. If a woman ""starts a fight""...a verbal argument with a man. She is accused constantly of starting fights with said man. She feels like she is trying to help him or confronting him with a real issue or has tried to say something nicely many times but isn't heard...but the man thinks it's ""nagging"" or ""rude"". On several occasions the man is ""forced"" to ""defend"" himself,with physical violence,against verbal ""attacks"". The first time she does not retaliate...she just takes it. The second time she pushes him away and scratches his arm to get him off of her. The third time and fourth time she fights back...she kicks him in the balls,etc. On every occasion she ends up with moderate injuries...bruised ribs, scrapes, scratches, bumps on the head, whiplash, large bruises,etc. The last fight she has with him is really scary. Here's the whole story: After he stayed up all night,working and drinking,she ""starts a fight"" with him. During the fight he tells her to move out. They continue to fight...in the midst of it he tells her to do the dishes. She tells him that she's only going to do the dishes that are hers is he wants her to leave. He grabs her by the hair, drags her to the sink and shoves her face in the dirty dishes. She bites his finger to get him off of her. He throws her to the ground and stands on her ribs. The fight continues to pushing, blows to the head, pushing against the wall. She tries to call 911 but he locks her in the house, covers her mouth and smashes her phone. He then calls his parents who come to his house and save her and take her and her things away. Even without the full details of all of the previous fights...is she guilty of assault or was she defending herself? Does he have the right to use physical violence in ""defense"" of yelling?

et58pk,My brother,"Hey everyone. Its my first time on this subreddit and well I don’t really know what to say. 

My brother told me some shocking and horrific things. Which he has given me permission to share on here, and only on here. We were up late one night while visiting home for Christmas. I’m pretty sure this must have been on the 28th. We sat in the old park behind our mom and dads house, sat on the swings, climbed to the top of the structures and smoked a joint or too.

For some reason the topic of my ex boyfriend was brought up. By him or me I don’t know. He knew a little of how he was. (He wasn’t abusive or anything. I guess in some ways he was) but he didn’t know the full story. So I told him. But through it all I felt him become distant. He wouldn’t look at me, kept nodding silently. Not in a listening way. He just didn’t seem all there I guess.

I finally ask what’s wrong and we sat there for a whole 5 minutes before I asked again. 

He had told me that his boyfriend (yes he is gay) got into drugs awhile back. Real hard drugs. every time they’d see each other he was either stoned or tripping hard. And then he’d drink. One night my brother and this piece of shit went to a friends place. They both drank. His boyfriend a lot more. They took drugs. Again, he took more than my brother. More and more people care and it basically turned into a party. 

When he woke up the next morning he couldn’t remember a thing. He woke up outside. Half naked and bleeding and in pain. He apparently had bruises around his neck and on his thighs from being strangled and grabbed. I assume you all know what I mean when I say that.

He started crying and went inside. The friends house they were at was originally friends with my brothers boyfriend so he was afraid anything that he said would get back to him. He was scared of him. 

But the friend got him to confess and my brother told him he thought it was his boyfriend. 

Why I’m telling you guys this is because. He’s not doing well. On the outside he’s that sassy cute guy wearing his makeup and dashing clothing. But on the inside I can tell he’s absolutely destroyed over it. He refuses to get help. The only other person he told was his best friend. She and I actually met up about 2 days ago when I was on my way to Maine and she has tried everything.

I honestly don’t know what to do. He needs help. I need to help him.

Any advice?

Thank you so much",throwaway1234567699,2020-01-23 20:25:57,2,474,17.62,85.91,36.87,33.03,9.48,13.08,95.99,60.34,24.05,18.57,6.75,0.84,0.63,9.49,0.84,5.49,4.43,11.39,9.07,6.75,7.81,2.11,21.31,4.43,1.9,2.11,1.27,4.01,4.22,2.32,1.9,0.42,0.63,0.21,22.36,1.69,2.53,0.63,12.03,13.08,3.16,0.84,1.27,3.59,1.9,4.01,2.53,0.42,1.05,1.05,2.95,1.27,1.05,0.42,0.63,9.92,5.49,1.05,2.95,1.48,0.21,10.13,8.44,0.21,15.82,1.69,8.23,6.33,0,0.63,0.63,0,0.42,0,1.48,0.21,0,0.42,0.42,0,15.4,9.92,1.05,0,0,0.21,0,0,0,3.38,0.84,0

etbejq,I was a molester.,"till I was 11 years old I molested other children.
I am well into my adult years now, but the trauma from molesting others as well as being abused myself, has pretty much destroyed my life.
I grew up in an extremely strict Christian household, my mother is a Narcissist, my father i suspect was as well, based on the physical beatings we were all subjected to. My first memory is of being raped by 4 older cousins/ brothers. I was approximately 3 years old. I am not sure if trauma causes you to remember more, but I have a lot of memories like that. I remember my parents having sex in front of me as well and being shown graphic horror movies and movies with graphic sex in them as well. I lived in constant terror because of the horror films. I am not saying any of this to excuse my behavior, but only to illustrate that what I thought was “normal” for a family was clearly fucked up.  As I grew up I found that I was being touched all the time and after the age of 6, I was being coerced sexually by other kids my own age. An older sibling told my parents what was happening to me, I remember being scolded against being a slut (which I had no reference for) But no action was ever taken against the abusers, so I think I got a warped idea of things. Around 9 yrs old I was given the responsibility of babysitting exclusively my two younger brothers. I was expected to cook bottle feed and change diapers, all in a squalid house. My parents were always gone, like for 24 full hours at a time( and never paid for a sitter). Before I knew it I became the abuser. I began acting out sexually and ultimately molested my own baby brothers. All I can say is that, I didn’t know anything about sex at the time, from what I remember I likened sex to a game played under the covers. I didn’t know that what I was doing WAS sex. I knew that what I was doing had to be hidden but didn’t understand why, or that it was wrong. When I was 11 I went through sexual education in school. I was devastated when I discovered that I was no longer a virgin and that I had stolen the virginity of my own siblings.  When I figured things out I wanted to rip off my own skin and crawl out. I swore off any kind of sexuality as a result, edging on repressive and frightened, I felt all sex was wrong that feeling sexual was wrong well into my 20s. I did not have a normal young adult life as a result of these events. I have been raped coercively and outright 2 times. I live in constant terror of being discovered, I have chronic illness now,  major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, CPTSD, and anorexia. Since then I have been married, and we have two kids now..I was so afraid I was going to molest the baby because of what I was in childhood, a monster. Well I never did and the kids are teens and well adjusted etc. I don’t think I will ever forgive myself in this life for everything I did. I just know that had I known the harm I was causing I never would have. 
I often wonder if this is how people grow up to become serial child rapists etc. what would have I become if it weren’t for intervention? I shudder to think. 
 I am still in contact with both all my brothers, and only one of my cousins who molested me when I was 2-3 yrs old. I forgive them because I need forgiveness, that I will never be brave enough to ask for. I just try and be there for the younger two,  when they need a listening ear or help in any way.",AcorbinDallas,2020-01-24 06:53:13,6,673,28.33,10.62,98.52,3.9,18.19,14.86,92.42,60.18,19.61,14.41,13.52,0.3,0.15,0,0.45,5.2,4.9,12.78,12.04,5.79,6.98,2.23,18.87,4.01,2.67,2.38,2.23,2.08,6.98,2.38,4.61,1.19,1.19,0.3,6.69,2.53,0.15,0.15,0.74,15.16,4.9,1.78,1.34,2.38,2.53,3.57,1.63,0.45,0.59,0.59,4.61,0.3,1.34,2.67,0.45,5.5,2.53,0.3,2.08,0.3,0.45,9.66,6.39,0.74,13.52,1.49,4.9,7.13,0.45,1.04,0.45,0.15,0.15,0,1.49,0.3,0,0,1.19,0,11.74,5.65,4.01,0,0,0.15,0,0.15,0.3,0.74,0.59,0.15

etc5oi,I want to help but not sure how,"Just to start I'm 23 symone is 22 and I've no idea how old her boyfriend is I'm guessing around the same age tho 

Alright so my friend/roommate (symone) has gotten a new boyfriend and he comes over quite a lot to see her. 

They've been together for like 4 months or something and this guy is so obviously hurting Symone not only emotionally but sometimes physically I think. 

I don't get all in there business or anything but from my room I can hear him yelling at her calling her a bitch etc. 

I've been friends with symone for about three years and we've lived together for just over one year and she's like the calmest person in the world she dosent yell ever she dosnent even swear and for the most part she's a pretty quiet girl. 

Now this guy is like fucking 6""4 or something he's massive and I know if he was screaming at me like that I'd probably pee myself and symone is about half my size ok she's like a stick.. 

She never yells back from what I hear so why does he have to yell at her like that ? 

I noticed bruises all up her arms the other night and I realised it's from him grabbing at her and I know this because not 10 minutes later I witnessed her accidentally drop and smash a cup on the kitchen floor ( I was laying on the lounge watching) when he lashed out grabbing her by her arms and pushing her up into the wall. He let go of her when I stood up probably because he dident even realise I was there. 

Symone refuses to talk to me about it keeps saying everything is fine and I shouldn't worry. I tell her everything is not fine that he is an asshole and she should dump him asap. But recently she's been talking about moving out of here and moving in with him. 

This is terrifying to me! I don't want her to be alone with that asshole and since I can't convince her to leave him I've been trying to convince her to have him just move in with us. So I can still keep an eye on her at least. 

But also I don't want to be anywhere near him he truly scares the crap out of me and I also want to punch him in his stupid face every second of everyday. 

He came over once when she wasn't home yet and I told him she wasn't here and he wanted to just wait there until she got back (would've been no big deal if the guy was normal) but I am just so uneasy around this guy I try to tell him to wait outside for her but he basically said I was being ridiculous and just shoved past me into the house. 

This guy is scary man what should I do ? Symone won't say anything to him and I'm scared if I keep trying to push her to breakup with him she'll just move out with him! I'd feel so guilty if anything happen to her. 


I know symone is afraid of him aswell she just won't admit it to me. She stars physically shaking when she hears his car pull up in our driveway at night and I try to tell her she dosent have to let him in she dosent have to date him and that we can call the police if he tries to hurt her. She absaloutley refuses all of it says I don't get it and that everything is fine and he's so lovely blah blah blah.. 

Is it a terrible idea to be trying to convince her to have him move in with us? Or should I just let her move out with him? 

It dosent look like she'd leave him anytime soon and I don't seem to be getting through to her when I express my concerns of the way he treats her ?

etf83u,Neighbor’s Argument,"Hi, I’m not sure that this is the right place to post this so I apologize in advanced if it is not. 

I’m freaked out this morning. For context, I do have a history of my father verbally and physically abusing my mother to the point of telling me (age 10 and under) that he was going to kill her. In a very literal sense. 

My upstairs neighbor is male who is dating a female for somewhere around 1-2 years. I’ve only met him. Once over smokes he told me in so many words that she was an angel who could do no wrong, and he wishes he could be more like her. I thought that was sweet. It was already odd enough to me that I’d never met her as a couple of us in the building hung out a few times. Come over for a drink or a smoke or meet up outside. Though it was few and far between that anyone did this she was never around. But I could hear her in the apartment on almost any other given day. I’ve heard them argue only once or twice in the last year+

Things got weird when I realized he was making insinuations I was not comfortable with. He knew I am in a happy relationship of ten years, we discussed it often. One day during a snowstorm he sent me a few pretty photos and I mentioned I was going out to shovel soon. He offered to help, which I thought was nice. I asked him if he’d like to come over for a smoke to return his favor. He said he was going to bring wine but I rarely drink due to my health problems that he also knows about. He asked if I wanted to watch a movie since it was a boring snow day. I have a bad habit of really letting people walk all over me and being overly nice, especially when I recognize guys getting a little too comfortable with me, I don’t know how to “reject” very well. 

Then he said something (can’t remember and really don’t want to look at his texts) indicating he thought we would be cozying up together during said movie. Yeah I was expecting more like two friends hanging out which is really my ignorance. I brushed off his comment with a joke and he said “so no cuddles?”  Then later confessing he’s been “crushing” on me even though we’ve really hung out only a few times. That he and girlfriend have been fighting. So I had to type this long awkward rejection out and he was respectful about it and said he is glad to be friends with such a great neighbor. I was satisfied. Side story: On another occasion while hanging out outside he asked if we could go inside because it was cold. I said yes to his apartment assuming girlfriend was inside so we wouldn’t be left alone together. He wanted to go inside my empty apartment. He’s always trying to get in here basically. 

They have been arguing for a few days, every night. Nothing crazy, regular couples’ bickering. Last night really kicked it up a notch and ended up giving me such flashbacks that I was sweating and shaking pacing around. 

This started getting intense at 1030pm and lasted through 1am. He started screaming really loudly telling her to shut the fuck up, that he hates her, she’s a piece of shit, don’t talk... and suddenly, CRASH!!! Followed by wailing (her) and him going “Yeah.” In a time as if to say “I TOLD you to shut the fuck up”. It sounded like she’d been hit and fell either into their cabinets/island/to the floor. Or he threw something at her. It was immediately silent for awhile. With my history of frequently witnessing abuse, it gave me a very bad feeling instinctually. 

Eventually the screaming started again and at one point he screamed “shut the fuck up!” way, way way louder. She kept talking and he screamed quite literally at the absolute top of his lungs “SHUT THE FUCK UP!!! SHUT THE FUCK UP SHUT THE FUCK UP” and I heard crashing again and she started screaming “I’m going to call the cops!” and he screamed “CALL THE FUCKING COPS.” I wish she had. Our PD arrives in moments, we are right where at least one always is. 

The rest of 12-1 am consisted of her absolutely shouting, begging really, him to stop. Just screaming stop over and over again. Louder and louder every time. I could tell she was moving across the apartment towards the door and he just wouldn’t stop. She was begging him to stop this until tomorrow (today); it was a work night and I do know they both have full time jobs they get up for at 8am. I think I heard him say something like “up all night” as in, “you will be”.  I slammed a door to remind them (him) I was home and could hear everything. Didn’t make a difference. 

Everything ended up coming to an end at 1am. At first I was really irritated because it sounded like a routine and tame disagreement and I had a migraine, which I suffer from chronically. I was sitting there thinking how mad I’d be if I were employed and had to get up early the next day. But then shit started getting absolutely out of control and I quickly realized I was not the most important person in this situation. 

I was particularly afraid because due to the timing I was positive this argument was because she found his texts to me, trying to hook up and letting me know he has feelings for me (literally makes me sick to my stomach). So I’m here thinking holy shit is one of them going to confront me, her being mad or him for my rejection?! 

What do you all think? Does it sound like this is a toxic and very serious situation or am I letting my past trauma surface and fueling emotion? Should I have done something? At what point do I intervene? So many stories out there with the point, “if only the person who heard this called the police”. I didn’t want to call the cops because they would know it came from me, and honestly I’m kinda scared of this guy now. I checked my locks at least 4 times.

I do know from growing up in a family with a horrible person as my father that often when people try to intervene trying to help the victim, it can get worse. The victim will deny wrongdoing and the aggressor has now been triggered and may take it out on his victim. 

Sorry for the ramble and if this in any way shouldn’t be posted here. Thanks for your advice. I’m really scared by what I heard. 

TLDR: my neighbors got into a fight which turned to sound (verbally FOR SURE) possibly like physical violence. The girl was screaming and crying and said she wanted to call the police, and didn’t. I don’t know how to feel about whether I should have done anything to help.",sleuthmeister,2020-01-24 11:27:00,0,1212,38.38,59.78,63.18,1,15.15,15.35,94.64,59.9,19.55,14.36,7.18,0.66,0.33,5.53,0.66,5.12,5.45,14.27,9.98,6.27,7.34,1.65,20.79,5.03,2.06,1.49,1.32,1.98,7.18,1.73,5.36,0.58,1.98,0.66,14.52,0.33,0.83,1.98,4.21,11.96,2.15,1.16,2.56,3.05,1.65,3.3,3.63,0.25,2.81,0.41,2.23,0.5,0.58,0.58,0.58,8.42,2.39,0.74,3.88,1.07,0.74,8.09,8.58,1.57,18.48,1.98,9.49,7.01,0.41,0.74,0.99,0.17,0.25,0.08,1.57,0.91,0.17,0.41,0.08,0,15.43,5.86,2.15,0.17,0.08,0.5,0.74,0.17,1.98,2.39,1.16,0.25

Sometimes it'd be like, did this happen and other times it would be like, when did they touch you? Where did they touch you? 

I have one false memory of being locked in a room and having things thrown at me because of this, which I know is undeniably false because the item that was thrown and broken in my memory still exists unbroken and isn't something that could be easily replaced.

etv6gx,"He said sorry. Me (F25 then), he (M25)","This happened a while ago, and i always kind of felt like I shouldn't feel the way I do. I feel violated, even when he did say sorry, even if we were both drunk and it was a minor incident.

It was at night and we were with a group of friends just drinking. One of my friends couldn't go home, cause it was pretty late and the train wasn't going to ride in at least 6 hours. So i told him to sleep at my place, I thought we were friends. I was extremely drunk, there were a lot of shots involved. He came late to the party, so he was a bit drunk but not all that much. 

We cycled home, and we were sitting on my couch when he asked for another drink. I said sure just a minute. I ran to my room to change in my pj's cause i didnt want to change with him watching, in my naivety I thought we could just sleep together, as I saw him as more of a brother figure than anything else. 

Back downstairs i sat next to him, when all of a sudden he was on me, like arms wrapped around me and his mouth on mine. I pushed him off and he didnt understand, saying stuff like he thought we had a thing. Even though he knew i was in love with a guy who just recently broke my heart. 

I told him i didn't feel the same, and he said stuff like think about it, and this is big opportunity for you, saying he thought i was pretty. I declined and told him i didnt feel confident anymore sleeping next to him. He said it was okay, that he wouldn't touch me. 

i got upstairs and gave him a sleeping bag to sleep on the couch. I locked my door, kind of terrified. 

he texted me saying he wasn't that drunk and that he meant what he was saying. And that i shouldn't exaggerated things in my head. He also asked for the wifi password. He than told me to keep this moment as an appreciation, and that he would have really kissed and fucked me good. and that there were 0 hard feelings.

I was stupig enough to tell him i didnt mind, that maybe on another time in my life i would have taken the opportunity, i didnt want to hurt his feelings. 

he didnt stop with the texting, saying stuff like, you should just think about it. that he really wanted to kiss me, that i was an opportunity now, and only that night. 

A couple of hours later he texted me saying he was very sorry, and that he couldnt do anything to change back time. And i should just laugh about it. 

I was shocked and laughed about it when it was all done. I did ask my house mates to check if he was really gone. A couple of days later I cried my eyes out. 

its been two years and i still feel like i shouldn't make such a big deal about it. That it was my fault.

etwv9x,Is not providing emotional support and ignoring abuse?,"My parents left me crying over my recent broken up relationship. They left to go eat dinner, I was supposed to come with them but they did not want to deal with my sadness, which made me panic. They just... left. I called them a thousand times because I saw them leaving the driveway and ignoring me when I ran after them. They just clicked off the phone every time.

I called my ex who did not want to deal with me... which sucked even more because I got heartbroken all over again but I did not know what to do.

I called them... no response.

I started cutting my wrist and told my parents in Messenger that I was scared to hurt myself even more. I called them again and they switched their phones off after they saw my messages.
While they were eating at a restaurant without me, I cried and panicked and slit my wrist to calm down... right now my mom is back but she does not want to talk to me unless I calm down because ‘she will only deal with my shit on her conditions’. My dad still clicks off the phone every time.

I get that dealing with emotions is hard, but this...
My mom bluntly told me to stop crying over my ex anyway, while losing a relationship of 2,5 years is really difficult for me. She told me to ‘get a life, get yourself together’. And now this social isolation of my whole family on a critical point. Them eating out without me while I’m panicking that they left me like that. Them knowing I was in danger and SHUTTING OFF their phones instead of checking up on me.

Am I the asshole for not coping with my situation and at the same time, feeling like they are assholes for not providing support, leaving me at home for being emotional while I wanted to come and shutting off their phones when I needed them the most?

etyjy8,I Gave Birth At 10,"My best friend's dad and my dad were like brothers. When I was a kid my dad used to work away 4 days out of 7 and I would stay at my friend's house. 

Everything was great. Then when I was 8 I took my period. My friend's dad started slow by molesting me and telling me it was to ease my period. He convinced me people would be mad at me for taking my period and that it would be our secret. By the time I was 9 it became sexual.

At age 10 one day I woke up the day my period was due. No blood. I thought I finally got rid of me period. I ignored the sickness and everything else then two months later I fainted in PE. 

The hospital told my dad I was pregnant and I very quickly was forced to tell them who the father was. It broke my dad and caused a rift in our community espcially since my dad didn't force me to have an abortion. By the time my son was born his dad was in jail. 

My son is now 10 and asking about his dad but I am not sure what to say.

etzq2c,Was i molested? Should i tell my younger sister what happened to me?,"Ill just cut to the chase(tldr), a few years ago around 16/17 my stepdad touched me. Should i tell my sister?

 It would start out as a hug and would turn to him rubbing my back. That escalated to putting his hands on my butt and squeezing. He would get more and more bold over the next few moths or so and put his hands under my shirt  and then under my bra from around my back. A couple days after that i was on the couch doing homework for history i specifically remember it being about ww2 and he asked me if i masterbated, i obvioualy told him no and he said ""are you aure because i thought i saw you"". I said no again and he asked me if i knew how. I said i had work to do and he left me alone and i cried.

Hes had a history of being verbally and phywically abusive. Holding things over my head making me feel like a burden, gaslighting and all that jazz. I never really knew it was abuse until i got older. Now im trying to understand whether or not this is sexual abuse /molestation?

eu59u7,Is not providing emotional support and ignoring abuse or am I?,"My parents left me crying over my recent broken up relationship. They left to go eat dinner, I was supposed to come with them but they did not want to deal with my sadness, which made me panic. They just... left. I called them a thousand times because I saw them leaving the driveway and ignoring me when I ran after them. They just clicked off the phone every time.

I called my ex who did not want to deal with me... which sucked even more because I got heartbroken all over again but I did not know what to do.

I called them... no response.

I started scratching myself and told my parents in Messenger that I was scared to hurt myself more. I called them again and they switched their phones off after they saw my messages.
While they were eating at a restaurant without me, I cried and panicked and was scratching myself to calm down... right now my mom is back but she does not want to talk to me unless I calm down because ‘she will only deal with my shit on her conditions’. My dad still clicks off the phone every time.

I get that dealing with emotions is hard, but this...
My mom bluntly told me to stop crying over my ex anyway, while losing a relationship of 2,5 years is really difficult for me. She told me to ‘get a life, get yourself together’. And now this social isolation of my whole family on a critical point. Them eating out without me while I’m panicking that they left me like that. Them knowing I was in danger and SHUTTING OFF their phones instead of checking up on me.

I eventually took my parents blankets with me so they would have to come to me and listen to me. They came in my room yelling at me and I was shocked and pushed them away. My mother pulled my hairs and my dad broke my clothing while I was resisting to give up the blanket without them listening to me.
They eventually called to police on me twice telling me they would put me in a psych ward. I remember my dad screaming ‘Have funpacking your bags!’. I gave the blankets back when the police came, they were very rude even though I was crying by then and pulling my pulled out hair from my head in front of them.  I then put my closet in front of my door to be left alone. I felt like absolute shit. 

Am I the asshole for not coping with my situation and at the same time, feeling like they are assholes for not providing support, leaving me at home for being emotional while I wanted to come and shutting off their phones when I needed them the most? Am I the asshole for taking those blankets away?

eu9oy7,I saw my abuser for the first time in years and it was a total disaster. I choked.,"To make a very long story short, for almost five years I was in an abusive relationship. By the time I got away from my abuser, I was being abused mentally, emotionally, sexually, and he had started violently shaking me and putting his hands on me during arguments. I felt free after getting away but unfortunately it didn’t end there. The abuser began driving an hour to hang out on my college campus, though he was not a student there. He infiltrated my group of friends, my only support, and spread the word that I was the abuser and he was a perfect boyfriend. On top of that, he began dating a girl in my major so sometimes I couldn’t even leave a class without seeing him waiting there with a shit-eating grin. It was a very dark point in my life. 

Not surprisingly, I have mental health issues, due to this and other traumas in my life. I have depression and anxiety, and in 2013 I was diagnosed with C-PTSD because of his abuse, something I have struggled with. 

The abuser moved to another state, but ultimately ended up returning, and very close to my town, to boot. I had no idea he was back until a friend told me, and I almost wish she hadn’t. I hadn’t seen him since around 2012 and frankly I never wanted to see him again. Since then I have had numerous conversations with my therapist discussing how I can feel empowered and safe if I were to run into him. 

Yesterday the day finally came. After a stressful week, my boyfriend of 2+ years, who knows about my past with this guy, suggested we get some takeout. I parked on the short end of the strip mall and we started walking by all the storefronts toward the restaurant. 

Suddenly about maybe….fifty feet away, I spotted my abuser and his family all walking out of the restaurant we were going to. Despite how often I talked about this in therapy, I was totally off my guard and my body went on red alert. My heart began to pound, my stomach clenched, my chest seized, and the only thought in my head was *GET OUT OF HERE NOW.* I turned to my boyfriend and said “Hang on a second, please” and started to walk back in the direction of my car. I took care to make sure I didn't run, but I did move kind of hurriedly, like I forgot my wallet or something. I just wanted to get somewhere else until my abuser and his family walked away from the door, because at our respective paces we were going to walk right up on them. I didn’t want them to see me. 

To my horror, my boyfriend, who had seen my abuser as well, began to chase me back to the car as soon as he realized why I turned away. I tried not to run or draw attention but my boyfriend followed me and kept shouting, “\[my name\], WHAT ARE YOU DOING? \[my name\], WHERE ARE YOU GOING?”  

When he caught up with me at my car, he told me I had humiliated him by walking away and I had no reason to behave that way because “\[Abuser\] is nothing and can’t hurt you anymore.” In fact, he acted almost disgusted with me. When we got home I tried to settle myself while my boyfriend sulked and ignored me. Finally, he told me that the way I behaved made him feel like I “didn’t know how to take care of myself.” He said I made him angry because if I took off when I saw my abuser it indicates that I may “abandon him in an hour of need.” 

I respectfully but firmly told my boyfriend that he had no right to tell an abuse victim how to handle seeing their abuser, and he was the one who made the situation noticeable by yelling and drawing attention. He had nothing to say to that. I also described several other scary and tense situations where I'd kept a cool head and did what had to be done. All he had to say to that was “Those are just words, they don’t mean anything.” 

We “moved past it,"" mostly because I didn't have the energy to deal with what happened AND an argument with him. And he acted like his sweet self for the rest of the night. But inside I’m struggling. My boyfriend always made me feel like he had my back. Now I feel like I trusted him with something sensitive that I really don’t open up to anyone else about, and he threw it back in my face and tried to make it all about him. He even made the situation worse by drawing attention. I don’t think I did anything wrong by calmly trying to walk away from a situation that I felt was uncomfortable. 

Because of what my boyfriend did, I worry that my abuser saw what happened. I had hoped when I saw him again I’d stand tall and walk by like he didn’t exist. But I got scared. I feel like he won and is probably laughing about what a pathetic coward I am.

eub7qj,Is this abusive or not?,"My husband and I have had a rocky marriage. He joined the military and left for training three weeks after we got married. We found out I was pregnant right before he had to leave, but there was nothing he could do to get out of going. Flash forward five months and he gets home and is really distant. I got really bitter because I was all alone for months and he only wants to hang out with his friends. I was sick a lot and didn't have family to help because they hadn't been speaking to me because they couldn't stand my husband.

We used to fight almost every day, but things seemed to be getting better. It's just that when we do fight, he only sees red and leaves - so me and our infant son are left without any kind of transportation in case of emergency. I never know how long he's going to be gone or if he's coming back.

We got in one of those fights today, and he came home and apologized. I told him I forgave him for leaving but I can't let him keep disrespecting us like this. He went on to start pulling books off their shelves (Books are my favorite things) and picked up a sledge hammer and threatened to start busting out the lights in the car unless he could leave and take the vehicle again. I had the keys so he grabbed the spare set and went outside. He pulled out a random cord/wire under the hood and said well now none of us are leaving.

eud42u,Was I abusive...,"I (M22) dated this guy for about a year. We had issues like every relationship does. But when I broke up with him asking to just be friends things were fine. But our friendship was slowly falling apart. 

I finally had enough of him and told him I didn’t want to be friends. I told him why. It was because he took so much from me. Depended on me to make his life better. To be perfect. 

He called (not his exact words but the implication was sure there) me emotionless. Told me he was always walking on egg shells because he was afraid of me. No I never laid a finger on him. No I never once raised my voice or degraded him. He was scared of me because of my lack of interest in his likes and dislikes. 

I admit I was distant. I didn’t really know how to handle relationships after the shit show that was my last one. The last person I dated was abusive. So I built up my walls. Closed up. Stopped talking about how I felt. 

He said it didn’t bother him but after our big fight the last night we were friends I now see that it did. I’m not trying to paint myself as a perfect person so I should probably mention this.

I was harsh on him during fights. I overreacted on the shit he did. And I even told him that I was sorry. I then told him how unappreciated and shitty he made me feel whenever he’d use me for advice and never even say thanks or recognize that I was helping him. 

Anyway. With the likes and dislikes situation. When we’d talk and he’d mention something he likes. I would show I didn’t like it. But I never. Said not once. “You can’t like that,” or “what the fuck you actually like that? You shouldn’t.” It was always a mutual disagreement. He now shares with people that he was SO afraid to be who he was because i was controlling, manipulative, etc. 

For Christmas I reached out and sent him a Christmas message checking up on him even though I didn’t like the son of a bitch whatsoever I still cared. I get a call an hour later from him saying if I ever message or contact him again he’s going to the cops. 

I think deep down I know I wasn’t abusive. But sometimes I think i was.

eugqhg,does it count as abuse if..?,"If i instigate the argument and escalate the situation (by yelling, throwing harmless things like a pack of alcohol wipes onto the ground), is it still abuse? My parents and I argue a lot. this is due to a combination of things, but mostly due to our bad tempers. Sometimes they start the argument, sometimes I do. However, my parents sometimes threaten me (breaking my leg if I don’t apologize to my dad, with death) and insult me (saying I’m ungrateful, a failure, a monster, undeserving, trash, an animal, etc.). My mom sometimes puts her hands on my neck and squeezed (not too hard) in an argument and has been physical before (pinning me down, etc). But after they start threatening me and getting in my face, I do start to fight (physically) back and sometimes even yell out threats myself. I know this would usually be abuse, but since I do start these fights and fight back, etc. would it still count?

euja60,"i want to leave my parents for a farm commune, but...","i want to leave my abusive parents. don’t we all. i have a half baked plan for doing so but i need more advice. i have no one to talk to in real life.
i have a plan to (hopefully) join a commune. i have a passion for farming and what not so i think living in a farm commune would be almost perfect for me. but in order to join most communes, you must first only stay for a few weeks, go back home, and then they will decide if they want you to come back. 
i don’t want my parents to know what i’m doing, once i leave i don’t want them to know where i am, i want to cut contact completely. if i could just up and leave one day without ever coming back i would do that. but if i do go to a commune, and i have to leave after the first few trial weeks before they decide whether they want me to come back, i don’t know where i would go during that in between period. my parents would never let me leave without telling them where i’m going, i probably couldn’t just come back after that. 
my first option is that i could tell my parents that i am taking an internship, go to the commune, come back home, and then if the commune accepts me i would leave home and never come back. but they would still want to know where i was. i don’t know what their reaction would be if i tried that. it probably wouldn’t work out very well for me.
the second option is that during the in between period, i could go somewhere else, obviously. but where would i even go? if i thought there was somewhere else that was safe i wouldn’t be thinking of doing things like this in the first place. i can’t stay with extended family. 
i could stay at a women’s shelter but i would have to get rid of a lot of my personal items which would be like killing myself. maybe i could keep my stuff in a storage facility but i don’t have a lot of money. i don’t know. there’s no guarantee that the commune will even accept me anyway.

eujp6r,I’m confused. Was this ok ? Really long.,"TRIGGER WARNING 
sexual assault

I don’t know how to word this really. I’m just having a very confusing time... when I was 14-15 I was “friends” with a group of guys. They would go back and forth between wanting to be my friend and hating me. They would call me names, taunt me at school until I cried, and say very mean things to me over the internet, saying they wanted to kill me or that I should kill myself. Then they would apologize and we’d be friends but it always happened again. Now I know that bullying is wrong but what I don’t know is this... they would come over to my house a lot (one boy in particular) and tell me that they would be my friends if I let them touch me inappropriately and that if I didn’t they would never talk to me again. I know the obvious answer should have been no, but I really wanted them to like me and I wanted friends so I let them. I never enjoyed it and I just layed there, it felt wrong, sometimes I’d say no but sometimes I’d just say nothing. After I would go back to school they would call me a slut, whore, easy etc. which to be fair is true but I would cry and be really embarrassed. But the more people that found out would want to come over and do the same things. I remember one time when there was four or five of them and they told me to go into my closet and shut it and if I didn’t then they wouldn’t ever talk to me again. The boy I really liked was outside of my room and refused to take part and I really wanted to hang out with him but I went anyway because I wanted them to like me. They never had sex with me but they all took turns touching me inappropriately. I remember asking if we could just kiss and one of the boys said “I would never waste my first kiss on you”.  It felt really bad. They all just told me they needed to practice to know how to do stuff like remove bras or other things with the girls they wanted to date and I accepted that this was how I would get attention and love. They told me I needed to start shaving even though I didn’t know how and didn’t want to. I was always harassed verbally at school for it and I always felt ashamed and I don’t know why I didn’t tell them to stop. I was finally guilted into my first relationship when I turned 15. I specifically told the guy I was waiting for sex til marriage but he raped me, took my virginity, and then broke up with me the next day. I was so confused because I had never had sex and I didn’t know if that’s what happened or not. Upon hearing I’d had sex another boy said he wanted to date me and he seemed nice so I dated him. He turned out to be very abusive both physically/sexually/emotionally. I was with him for over 6 years. He would choke me until I passed out and leave me in rooms for hours. It was bad but I loved him. I became anorexic and my step dad was abusive too. Around this time he also touched me when he thought I was asleep. He didn’t rape me though so it wasn’t really that bad. I know that some of the things that happened were abuse but I don’t know if the things that happened when I was 14 with my “friends” was okay? I feel kind of fucked up about it, but they were my friends and the same age as me and I never protested or fought for them to stop so it seems like it should have been okay. Sometimes when I would drink or take drugs I know I was assaulted but I couldn’t do anything because I couldn’t move from taking too much Seroquel/drinking too much. I don’t know if I’m just being pathetic and looking for excuses for why I am mentally and emotionally fucked up. I just would like some input I guess. It seems okay because I know a lot of other people have been through worse things as really little kids by adults. But for some reason it seems like it was wrong but I could just be over re-acting. I tried to Google but I couldn’t find much help. This is really the only place I know to get advice.

eunhvc,How do I escape abuse in an emergency?,"There’s a lot of history so i’ll try to make it short.

My mom has abused me since I was very young. Emotionally and verbally, not physically/sexually at all. My parents got divorced two years ago, and my dad (who is an angel to me) got primary custody. 

But my mom hasnt stopped abusing me. I dont do well with stress, and she knows that, but she puts me through emotional hell every moment of every day I stay with her. I can’t go on living like this. It’s gotten so bad that I have a panic attack and melt down every time I have to see her or talk on the phone. She knows how much pain I’m in, but she still insists on enforcing the parenting schedule. My mental health has gone down the toilet. I started starving myself, I can’t sleep, and I struggle to concentrate at school and in other things.

It escalated a week ago when my dad took me to the hospital to talk to the mental health professionals there. They filed a case with CPS, but that could take another month at least. My mom showed up, called the police, and humiliated me in the waiting room, trying to make me cry but also laugh to show I was faking it, while also taking pictures of me over and over.

Court is another option to get away from my abusive mom, but it’s very expensive and by the time it’s settled, i’ll be 17, which is legal age of not following the schedule anymore (and a lot of other things i guess)

I’ve seen countless counselors and psychologists, and we’re working on getting anxiety meds for me. But I dont know how I’m supposed to cope in the meantime.

euqka4,How do I know if I suffered childhood abuse?,"When I was younger I had a lot of issues that my mother took me to a therapist for but they never understood where the issues stemmed from. The therapist apparently said something like it could have come down through “epigenetics” but I don’t understand how that would work. (Though my parents both grew up in hugely abusive households, they were both nurturing and loving). To give more detail during the nights I would not only refuse to go to sleep but my mother had to be right there with me every night. She explained I was a “light sleeper” and didn’t like being alone. As I grew older I developed a sort of abandonment complex. Anytime I was left in a car alone while my parents would be gone to get groceries or something like that I would begin hyperventilating and attempting to escape. This stemmed from a belief that they would never return and no one would find me; completely irrational beliefs. Therefore I was known as the difficult child or dramatic because they believed I loved the acting. The fear was real but nothing that I can remember happened to cause this fear. I also would sleep walk a lot but it wasn’t doing activities it would be me walking to my parents room, asking if I could sleep with them and waking up the next morning believing they must have carried me into their room. This leads me to believe it may not been the fear of sleep but more of being unsafe. There were other instances where I often wet the bed to an older age or even during the day but my mother never wanted me to feel embarrassed. I was also naturally scared of the dark, these could be non relating factors as they are not unusual but just thought I would mention them. Obviously I don’t want to jump to unhealthy conclusions, I just really am stumped.

euv16r,The relationship after the abusive one,"Just looking for a conversation on this. 

I’m in such a foggy state of mind about this. I’ve finally found someone who encompasses all the amazing things I knew I deserved and I would find after my hellish abusive relationship. I freed myself of the abusive ex two years ago and have remained single aside from one casual fling. 

Now I’m scared— I found someone that I *want* as an addition to my life. We’ve been seeing each other for about two months with a long distance build up/friendship for about 6 month. 

The timing never feels right to bring up the abusive of my past and I can’t help but feel like I’m pulling some kind of “damsel in distress” card, or worse, sometimes I even feel like “damaged goods”

I know I’ll talk to him about it eventually but I guess I just want to get some insight on this. Anyone with personal experience? Anyone on the other end of this (in a relationship with someone who suffered domestic abuse). 

I want to clear my head of the doubt, the fear and all the triggers. I just want a light, easy, freeing loving connection without the weight of this. 

I hate that it’s a part of “my story” and I think my ex made me feel that way. 

Any words for me? Thanks always all.",kristinab1211,2020-01-27 13:46:04,3,233,71.79,23.28,95.05,1,15.53,15.45,93.99,54.94,21.89,13.3,12.45,0.43,0,0.43,0,8.58,7.73,16.31,4.29,5.58,3.86,1.29,14.59,4.72,2.58,0.86,2.58,3.86,9.44,2.58,6.01,1.72,3,0.43,9.01,0,0,0.43,0.43,18.45,4.72,0.86,2.15,5.58,2.58,3,4.29,1.72,0,2.15,1.29,0.43,0.43,0,0.43,5.15,3,0,1.29,0.43,0.86,3.86,11.16,0.86,13.3,0.86,6.01,6.44,0,0.43,0.43,0,0.43,0,0.86,0,0,0,0,0,16.31,5.15,2.15,0,0,0.86,0,0,2.58,3.43,0.86,1.29
ev11pz,Healing After Years of Narcissistic Abuse (Repost),"I'm finally healing after years of Narcissistic abuse and have decided to further my education in going to college at 23 to pursue a major in psychology. I'm now only waiting on FAFSA &amp; college approval to enroll in the courses online for the semester. 

I'm bettering myself slowly day by day and can immediately see unhealthy things and steering clear of those issues. Such as for example a week ago I bought 12 pack of beer and although I didn't drink (maybe 1-2 a day) much I could immediately sense that if I continued buying I would slowly become an alcoholic. I now refrain from it mostly and try to avoid buying it altogether. 

The things I saw, felt, heard, and witnessed when the narcissistic abuse went on was horrible. I remember it all started with my mom each time would go to the casino and get drunk. Then it progressed to her spending all of her one retirement account of $40k within a couple weeks. During this time my father was getting progressively unstable and abusive in his own way from coping from the crazy behavior of my mom. 

Fast forward just recently, my mom has stopped drinking alcohol entirely but still is an emotionally abusive  &amp; unavailable person that's still unstable but not to the levels of where it was. She's still a nasty negative unsupportive mother and the same of my father. 

I got an apartment a month ago and had finally had enough &amp; saved enough resources to move out. I still occasionally go to my parents house for things (like I am now) but try to avoid them if possible due to their constant emotional abude, negativity, gaslighting, manipulative tactics, and unstable explosive passive aggressive behavior. 

Today I stopped in at their to use their computer (until I get my own gaming PC soon enough) and mentioned how I went to the local public library and he mentioned how he had to buy books I lost when I was in school (which is a lie). I told him sternly to be respectful and stop bringing up negativity to which he responded and with, ""Don't give me orders!! I'll say whatever the fuck I want to you, it's my house!"" and I told that he won't and I won't tolerate disrespect. Then he (like a toddler) screams &amp; yells complaining and waking up my mom out of a sound sleep where they both blame me. He then told me ""you're not turned out for [psychology] and you need to clean house"". ""You won't make it by yourself, you always need my help"" he said.  

I finally had the emotional intelligence to say, ""You're my father, you're supposed to be supportive of your kids. You are the FUEL to my FIRE and I'm going to do this because you said I can't"" he then continues on yelling with this malevolent sick twisted smile on his face. 

In the recent past  from him I've been called ""gay"" &amp; ""faggot"" (on my khaki pants), constantly questions my sexuality recently (I'm comfortable with my sexuality now), throws a tantrum when I want to show/need help from him, pouts from his narcissistic rage saying ""Fine, I just won't ever talk to you and keep to myself"" then retreats to watch TV all day, and will conjure up any negative outcome or even create it entirely to scare me out of any ambitions.



These are bad broken people and I wanted to share this with someone because we're not alone. 

I plan on making a career being a clinician/councelor/therapist to help &amp; understand/diagnose mental disorders and the analytics behind them! I love watching Dr Grande on YouTube for information &amp; my interest in psychology. 

I'm on my own so far as family is completely broken (my brothers are all estranged from each other and I haven't' talked to my extended family in months). It's difficult at best but not impossible to grow as person. I've had to change myself so much these past several months I'm actually shocked how far I came.

ev2sy5,Coming to terms with how I was raised. Realizing now that Asian mothers ‘discipline’ was actually straight up abuse,"nearly 18f Korean American here. it took me 17 years to realize I dealt with some form of abuse growing up. I think I can safely say that it is why I have been perpetually overwhelmed with anxiety, shyness, and fear socializing with people all my life. I’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts since I was 12. I also have incredible anger at times, taking it out on myself and others physically. 


My traditional mom would hit me with a bamboo stick as discipline, as well as anything she could get her hands on. I’d cower in the corner from when I was 6 years old and just take it straight to the legs, head, and arms trying to duck. I remember one time specifically when I was maybe 8 or 9 when I made a glass of chocolate milk and I filled the glass up to the brim, so it was spilling in the kitchen. she yelled and scolded me and I got slapped. Then one time I didn’t want to brush my teeth (I had to be super young) so she jammed the tooth brush in my mouth and brushed violently, it hurt and my teeth were covered in blood afterwards. 

Also, I must say please and thank you or else. I started to notice something was different very recently, like 2 years ago, because when my friends parents handed them things like a napkin they didn’t say thank you everytime. I began asking them why they didnt and told them it was a big deal to my mom. this is because if I didn’t say thank you, I would be told I’m ungrateful and be yelled at, and then usually be slapped or hit on the hand. I also remember sitting in a chair and having my back be hit with the bamboo stick so I would sit up straight. 


I also never rode in the front seat of the car because I knew it was arms length from my mother. I never rode in the front seat until I was 17, and I was apprehensive even then. Though growing up she still found a way to get me even in the back seat, throwing the nearest object at my face hard. 


I remember being a child begging my dad whos caucasian to protect me and stand up for me. he never ever hit me, he only shoved me once in all my life. At first he would try telling her to relax but he never actually intervened. He said he couldn’t get in between my mom and I or else she would be mad at him and then it would be even worse. 

anyway, last summer I was describing how my mom disciplined me to my therapist, doc said it was abuse. I was like what?????? No way. she said it wasn’t normal. i told the therapist it is normal in my moms culture, and my doctor said it was prevalent in her culture as well (she was Indian) but that it is no excuse and it is plain abuse. 

It’s weird because I love my mom. We have never been super close though. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to talk to her about it. 

I now lash out at people, only when I’m under intensive stress. I see my mom in myself and hear her in my voice when I yell. It’s like anger overrides my brain and I don’t even realize what I’m doing or saying. then after I immediately apologize because it’s like I was possessed and could only sit back and watch as another person took over my brain for a few minutes.

I lost my one and only best friend that I had for 5 years, and one of our last interactions was me going nuts at her. I was begging her not to leave my house because I didn’t want to be left alone, and I began screaming at her and throwing things at her. I threw her stuff all over the place and would take her phone and threaten her. I put a hole in the wall. i don’t have any close friends now.",sarahxfaithx,2020-01-28 00:21:34,3,715,11.69,25.54,91.12,5.95,17.44,11.89,92.03,61.96,22.38,17.62,12.59,0.28,0.42,3.64,0.7,4.76,3.5,12.03,10.49,7.69,10.07,2.52,20.56,3.64,2.24,1.82,1.96,0.98,5.17,1.68,3.5,0.98,1.68,0.56,11.05,1.54,0.42,3.92,1.12,11.47,1.68,1.68,1.96,2.24,1.82,3.22,3.5,0.28,2.24,0.98,3.36,1.96,0.84,0,0.42,6.43,1.26,1.12,2.38,1.4,0.7,8.11,8.67,1.12,17.2,1.54,8.67,7.41,0.14,0.14,0.28,0.28,0,0.14,0.42,0,0,0,0.28,0.14,12.73,5.45,3.08,0,0,0.84,0,0,0.14,2.66,0.56,0
ev4v2d,Is this abuse?,"This is a long post and I don't think I can TLDR it, the context is important. I truly don't know if I am abusive or how I can do better.

I have been in the same relationship for 15 years. There were times, especially near the beginning that we had to spend months apart. We even broke up a few times during some of them. We even say that even though we've ""been together"" for 15 years the number we have spent together is probably more like 12.

We spent time apart because she got a job elsewhere, her visa expired (we are British and Japanese) and various other reasons. Flash forward to 7 years ago and I made a decision I regret to this day. We were living together in Spain and I was offered a job in the UK. We applied for her to get a visa but it was denied. I decided to take the job because we were poor while living there and we had to borrow money from friends and family to get by, a situation we both hated.

I took the job thinking that it would bolster our income and we could use that to be together, especially if they would let me go remote eventually. Unfortunately, her UK visa was denied. I went back and she was forced to go back to Japan to her abusive family. I wish more than anything I had turned down the job and we had stayed in the same country.

Over the next few years, she finds a way to get an EU visa but cannot visit the UK. I visited her in the EU wherever she was staying and eventually I change to a low-paying online job so that we can live in the same country at least. We bounce around various EU countries and during this time she has been unable to work and has been very sick. We are finally somewhat stable living in Ireland after I get a new job there but we are still very poor.

Now, we struggle to do anything. Our cost of living is too high for us to get out and socialise much so we haven't made many friends. I like to go to the bars and chat with people but she's not a drinker. We also can't really afford to meet people this way because of the money problems.

The problem I am having is that whenever she gets frustrated enough with how bad things are she reminds me that this is all my fault. If things get tough because of money and we are stuck inside all the time she tells me that I ruined her life with the choice I made years ago. I robbed her of the years since then because nothing has ever changed for her, no job, few friends and she is totally reliant on me because I'm the only one able to work. She will tell me that she feels trapped here with me and that she can't leave me even if she wanted to.

I feel totally wracked with guilt every time this comes up and I frequently contemplate suicide/self-harm. For a while, I was harming in secret but she found out and told me that I was being selfish and making everything about me. I don't want to be selfish so I never mention it now but when she starts yelling at me and telling me how unhappy she is that we can't do anything and she has no friends or life because of me I can't help but get upset. She says that every time I do I'm making it about me again and I never had to suffer like she after what I did to her.

I would like to stop feeling this way and I want to know if I am being abusive by doing this? How can I change so that I can help her be happier?",Ayrlynne,2020-01-28 04:18:18,1,669,14.56,61.19,60.34,1.12,19.68,12.56,95.37,64.28,21.97,16.59,7.92,3.89,0,4.48,0.3,5.38,4.93,11.36,11.21,7.32,9.27,2.24,20.48,3.74,2.24,1.2,0.75,2.54,5.23,0.9,4.19,0.45,1.05,0.9,13.15,0.3,0.6,4.48,0,14.2,2.24,3.44,2.39,1.94,2.09,4.04,0.9,0,0.45,0.45,1.49,0,1.2,0,0.3,11.21,6.13,0.75,2.24,1.79,0.75,6.73,12.41,0.75,15.25,2.39,6.73,6.88,1.79,0.75,0.3,2.39,0,0.15,0.15,0,0.15,0,0,0,9.57,4.63,1.64,0,0,0.45,0,0.3,0.3,1.79,0.3,0.15
ev7n0x,About antisocial personality disorder,"It's normal that I want nothing to do with people that are sadistic and lack of empathy? 

Let me explain: if you discovered that your friend is a clinical psychopath/narc and that they are fake caring for you all the time (probably see you as pathetic for having empathy), would you stay with them? 

I know I sound like a horrible person for having panic attacks on this, because a friend confessing you this and being vulnerable with you is a sign of trust and leaving them would make me a traitor. But my body goes on ''flight or fight'' mode after noticing mask dropping, a sense of danger.

But again... They aren't actively ''abusing'' me, but the thread is there. Probably I sound biased, how I stop being prejudiced and stop my triggers?

I remember when this friend told me (once we were close) that they wanna kill/torture animals in such an apathetic tone I almost cried. They don't do it because ''it's illegal''.

Manipulative, verbally abusive, a gas lighter, demeaning, insulting, unhappy so she insisted on making everyone else such too, etc. It took me a while after my parents got divorced but I figured it out. I no longer talk to her and haven’t in over a year. My middle brother moved in with her after she manipulated him to and doesn’t speak with any of us anymore. 

I live alone with my father now and I just turned 19. It’s with him that I’ve seen some things that I think constitute as abuse. The obvious thing is my dad is mentally ill so he he’ll have these episodes where he’ll go off over something seemingly pointless. Screaming, cussing, and then giving a half hearted apology or none at all. Just acting like it never happened. That’s one of the things my mom used to get my brother to leave. Convinced him he was better off with her. Honestly, I don’t think he’s better off with either of them but whatever. I don’t think anyone is.

My dad also has moments where he seemingly manipulates me into doing/not doing stuff. For instance when we got my car he put it in his name and agreed we could split the payments for it in half. I’ve had the car for almost a year now and I can confirm I’ve had to make all the payments. Which is fine in itself. But he shouldn’t have basically lied to me about it and then gotten mad the one time I wasn’t gonna make the full payment. Literally I went to make half the payment and he was like, “You need to be more responsible! Quit spending your money on stupid things!” He also got mad over the fact I had a savings. Which is gone now mainly because of the things he’s made me pay for. Via guilt tripping me into doing so.

He still has the episodes sometimes and they just come out of complete nowhere. He’ll be fine one second and then raving about something the next. He’s even called me a selfish bi**h one time in the middle of an episode. Just because I didn’t take his “apology” seriously. He’s called me stupid more times than I can count, in general insults my intellect, etc.
 
But the worst thing is his drinking. He has a drinking problem. Took me way too long to figure it out but it’s true. Every time we go to the store he’s picking up a bottle of whiskey, moonshine, or straight up vodka. Which by the way will be gone in legit two days time. I’ll walk into the room sometimes and he’ll quickly hide whatever he’s drinking and pretend like nothing happened. I can’t talk to him about it I’m too afraid to. I don’t want to compromise my safety. I live in a state of actual fear and anxiety. I hate it. If someone were to put me in another living situation I don’t think I’d know how to feel. I don’t know anything else other than this. 

I feel like I can’t trust anybody I call “family.” Even my brother and his wife know about some of his problems but they don’t really seem to care. One time my brother had to take me into work because my dad was drunk. In the middle of the day! He confronted him about it later but he fluffed it off as usual. I’ve kind of grown to resent my brother and his wife too because they just love glossing over obvious problems and leaving me to deal with them instead of facing them or at least offering me supposed. They’d rather preach to me about all the things I should do and say differently to my dad. 

I’m just so sick of it all. So does it sound like I’m being abused? Or at least that my family has issues and it’s not just me? I have to know. I need clarification. I can’t trust my own judgment because I have no confidence in myself.

evcoqn,My boyfriend triggered me tonight,"My boyfriend and I were at a store and he wanted me to look at something. I couldn’t tell what he was trying to get me to look at, so he gently put pressure on my ponytail (kinda like pressing down a little) thus tipping my face up to look. Obviously this wasn’t aggressive, but it triggered my trauma from previous abuse. He said he didn’t mean to scare me, and that he knows that physical contact like that sometimes puts me in a weird mood, so he tries not to do these things. I can’t seem to shake this anxious feeling, and now I’m worried that he does these things on purpose to make me uncomfortable. He’s a really great guy and I’ve been with him a long time, and there’s no other red flags. I have ocd and lately my obsessive thoughts have been about abuse, so I’m wondering if maybe that’s why I’m so upset.

evcrrm,Abused by sister,"Never talk about this or post anything online but seems like a decent place to do it. And i apologize for the disjointed feel of this in advance i’m just kind of winging it but i just need to get this written down. Im a 21 year old male &amp; til i was about 16 i was abused heavily by my sister (three years older than me.) 

For a long time when i was little my mom was single and had to take care of both of us while she worked. A lot of the times we would go to my grandmothers and stay there. My grandmother is an old-fashioned christian and romanian woman so we were usually off by ourselves doin whatever. I don’t understand the reasoning behind it but ever since she would constantly hit me, scratch me, make me bleed, attack me with objects or threaten me with knives, and the physical wasnt always the worst part. I, nor did anyone else do anything to stop her. She would wreck things, steal from me, or make up elaborate stories and get me in the blame for things constantly. I did nothing wrong to her.

This happened for a few years then eventually we moved around the city and out of town a few times. Always going to a new school and what friends i did make i was always the weird kid. Stopped caring to talk to people after a while knowing it wouldnt last, even as a small kid. I have always hated school because i was bullied and was slower and could not focus on the task at hand. Always failing always afraid of the students and teachers alike. But it still scared me less than going home afterwards.

She was always there, always ready to hit me or attack me or turn everyone against me. She’s even spread rumours about me around schools we went to. She loved it she always did it with a smile. She had once locked me outside in a thunderstorm, telling me to go get something. I was in shorts and a tshirt. It was raining really hard and was extremely windy. I tried running around banging on the doors. I was outside for almost 2 hours until my mother came home. 

Another instance was she came into my room, i was minding my own business (playing video games i think). She unplugged everything from the tv, threw all my stuff on the floor and smashed it. I was obviously confused for there was no reason. She just looked at me and smiled and said that when she got back home (my mom) she would tell her I did it, and “make you seem like the bad guy, while i’ll be seen as the good guy.” Hearing her say that is when it clicked that she has something seriously fucked up going on in her head.

Years went on this shit kept happening and i became more recluse and quiet. Always seen as the quiet kid but they never know why so they just assume you’re just timid. I don’t want to open myself up to people because i dont want to be taken advantage of. 

When i was about 13-14 we were living in a small town and i made a few friends. We all got pretty close the only real friends ive ever had. Still talk to a couple today. It seemed things were going ok despite me still doing bad in school. 

I was 15 i think and i noticed i was missing an assignment back at home. I asked my teacher to go get it and she said it was alright because i didnt live far at all from the school. When i got there, my sister was there. Skipping school. Cooking. Listening to music.  I just decided to ignore her and just grab my assignment that i left on the table. I grabbed it, and turned around to leave. She notices me.

She screams at me, “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING SKIPPING SCHOOL?!” Which is pretty hypocritical to say to me at this moment. I told her i just wanted to leave i wasnt gonna bother her. Of course she wasnt having it. She started to call my mom and yell on the phone telling her i was skipping school, and for some reason added in there that i was doing drugs. I was so furious at this point i walked back, grabbed the phone and ended the call. As i turned around to leave she screamed like a banshee and as i turned around she was holding a knife coming after me.

I did not know what to do if i tried to leave she would have chased me like before. I grabbed her hand, twisted it and lifted her above my head. I was a normal sized kid and she was about my height at that point but it felt like a feather. I slammed her down really hard on to the floor and i hurt her pretty bad and she was screaming bloody murder rolling around on the floor. I just stared at her my adrenaline was going hard.

In those few moments staring down at her i fantasized about killing her. Kicking her, stomping on her hitting her and using that stupid knife on her. It was a split second decision but it could have went either way. I wanted to hurt her so bad for all the times she did to me, but i just left.

When i got back to school i broke down crying and avoided everyone. Afterwards i was afraid to go home so i slept on a bench outside for a few hours (was winter).

After that we didnt talk for a couple years. I fell hard into smoking pot with my friends and drinking. Never liked pot much but i still have a problem with drinking because it numbs you and makes you not care for a brief moment. 

Now she’s 24, has a kid with her bf, her own house, and has never apologized. She acts as if nothing ever happened and still tries to ask me for favours from time to time.

I’m now addicted to alcohol, can’t keep a job for more than a couple months, always broke, i have no friends, no girlfriend etc. I can’t blame all of it on her because i know there were other factors too, but its hard not to. 

I want to find purpose and be less depressed and negative about everything but everything i try to do i don’t feel any connection to it. None to people. Even people i could have potentially dated i always end it. I just don’t see people the way i wish i saw them. I just see vulnerable people trying to use whatever they can against you. But i can’t say ive given up. I gotta keep trying. If you got this far thanks for reading. Like i said just needed to write it down.",guyatthestorecounter,2020-01-28 14:21:32,9,1183,31,34.54,85.65,3.69,14.79,12.17,95.1,60.86,21.81,16.31,10.31,0.76,0.59,4.31,0.34,5.49,4.82,14.12,8.37,6.59,7.52,2.54,20.54,4.23,2.37,1.1,0.93,2.37,5.66,1.69,3.97,0.68,1.44,0.68,11.67,0.76,0.76,5.16,0.34,13.02,1.94,1.61,1.78,2.62,2.79,3.8,3.8,0.76,1.61,1.44,1.86,0.68,0.68,0.17,0.42,7.02,1.78,1.01,2.28,1.35,1.01,9.04,8.54,1.1,17.41,2.96,7.52,7.44,1.78,0.93,0.68,0.08,0.08,0.17,0.76,0.34,0.25,0.17,0,0,11.75,6.59,2.54,0,0.08,0.08,0.08,0.17,0.34,1.1,0.68,0.08
evf3y9,Was I molested? Did I forget what happened? Or does my brain trick me into thinking these? I have to pour things out.,"I have to share this, I just don't want to do something terrible to myself so I have to share this. This may be a long post, but I have had enough. I will either end my life or struggle a bit more and get some help. I plan to do the second, but the first is always in my mind. I am tired. 

What I will write may be something sick and disturbing here and there. But what I want is an answer. All my life I have searched for an answer, for a reason, for what I have gone through all those problems, for what I harmed myself, for what? 

I want an answer, and I want a valid answer. 

My childhood was a difficult one. I grew up in a house where abuse was something normal. My father abused my mother, he beat her, he tried to kill her, he had even tried to shoot her with a gun when I was in her arms as a baby. I believe that he also raped her, she didn't share such a thing but I don't think that his abuse was just made up of beating or tormenting her psychologically. He is a ""good"" man now, but I can't just forgive him, I just can't. 

I also had my share of abuse, not physical as far as I remember, as my mother told once that he also hit me several times when I was a baby, but his abuse was mostly psychological, he made me believe that even if I do a small mistake, even if I just do something he doesn't want, then I am stupid and worthless. I grew up believing that I had to be perfect to be accepted by others, especially by other men. I even developed a sense of misogyny. I was critical, I was hateful, I was jealous of women; women who were self confident enough to stand up for themselves. I made men use me, I literally raped my own self. I literally had sex with a man, for instance, even though I didn't want that so that he would love me, so that he wouldn't hate me. He didn't. He wouldn't want a woman who love bombed him from the moment they met, why would he want a selfless woman? He didn't even look at my face after he finished, why would he? 

I don't think I ever really loved someone, I don't know what love is. I don't know my feelings. I had boyfriends, I thought I loved them but in reality I just didn't. I was just scared that they would leave me, I manipulated them with my ""love"", made them think that they wouldn't find anyone like me, the perfect woman who never says ""no"" to them. But I wasn't. I was just a robot who plugged herself into others to live, a leech sucking their blood. They didn't want me, rightly so. I didn't want them too after some time, I just felt nothing. 

When I was 11, I remember that I had just discovered what porn was. I don't remember how but I remember that I enjoyed watching rape porns, I enjoyed them for what I don't know. I left watching porn completely when I realized what I was doing. I don't watch porn and I hate the idea of rape now, but at that time for what I enjoyed that kind of porn I really have no idea. I was a little child, why did I do that? It is sick. Then there was a man who was our neighbor, he harassed children, women... It didn't matter, he was a psycho. He would watch me like a creep whenever he saw me, and I liked his attention, I liked the idea of his touching me sexually. I was 13. I never have an urge to hurt someone, but what I did to myself was something terrible even to remember. I had social anxiety as a child, I gained weight a lot after a short time. I was an angry, uneasy child who always tried to beat other children, who would always wet her bed, who would skip her classes, who would wet herself constantly in school. My friends ostracized me several times throughout my childhood.


When I was in highschool, I wasn't even able to speak to my peers, I was so ashamed of myself, having a terrible social anxiety, I couldn't even go out. Then I committed suicide. I didn't achieve. I sometimes wish I had. Years passed with my eating disorder, I would eat to the point of being sick, stuffing food into my mouth to hurt myself even though I didn't want to eat anymore. I was depressed, waiting for a time to commit suicide again, I planned it every single day. Then I decided to lose weight, I lost it but because of what? Because of that man who just wanted to fuck me, I thought he would like me in the end, he would fall in love with me. He did and he threw me away. I didn't do it for myself, but for validation and love from a stranger. 

I like strong, clever, self confident men. My current boyfriend is like that. He just doesn't give a fuck if he loses people in his life. He is strong willed. But he doesn't like that I had sex before him. He thinks that I am stupid for doing such a thing. He thinks that I lack in many qualities. Then he says that he loves me. Do I love him? Or am I with him just because I freak out at the idea of ending up alone. I am afraid that he will leave me one day, ""the man of my dreams"", he did that before, why wouldn't he do that again? For what I love him? 

Maybe every men I meet think like that about me. I even hate the idea of sex, I have never had orgasm while having sex. He doesn't know this. All he does is to criticize my past life. He doesn't realize that I suffered, and that what I say are excuses. He ""accepts"" me. Do I? I don't know. I want to get married to him. For what? I don't know. I don't know who the fuck is the real me!
He is like my father, judging me all the time. I am afraid of losing him. I am afraid of standing up for myself, saying ""no"" to him, because he just distances himself from me then.

All I wanted was to be loved, to re-create that peaceful family which I had lost from the very start. I want children, I want a husband who accepts the real me; but for that firstly I have to learn who is that real me. I don't know if I will ever be able to find someone who will accept me, whom I will love, with whom I will build a family. Maybe it will be too late till I find myself first. But if I don't find myself, then what will happen to ""me""? I plan killing myself again, every single day. 

What I want to learn is that why I behaved in such a sick way as a child? Was I molested? I even think about this possibility now. I don't remember such a thing. I don't think my father did such a thing, he would do that to my sister as well, and would continue doing that, so I don't think he did that. But if something happened and I don't remember it, is this normal? Or am I so desperate for an answer for all my anomalies that I just think that something of sort must have happened to me when I was a child. Why did I use my sexuality to ""trap"" men for validation and love? Why I can't fucking say ""no""?

I had to share this, I am not a psycho. I am just heavily injured and if I don't fix things soon then I have to kill myself. I don't want to care if you mock or judge me too. But I have no one to turn to, speak to in my life. They wouldn't understand. Maybe no one would. But still, I have to pour things out at least here. I don't know if I exaggerate what I went/go through, and am a spoiled person. But what I know is that I suffered/suffer terribly, and I want to heal and function as a healthy and independent woman.

evngs2,Abusive ex,"My ex partner was abusive. Emotionally and mentally. When we started dating it was us, and my boyfriend, the three of us dated. For the first month, everything was great, we always were together or talking, just having a good time. About a month in, the ex got grounded by their parents (17 at the time). So my and my boyfriend would hang out together and wait for her to message, and respond almost immediately afterwards, and things seemed fine, but they would get sarcastic or upset because they weren't involved. After they were ungrounded things went back to normal, except that they would get mad at me over nearly everything, then would block me, ignore calls or pick up and tell me to go eff myself, then talk to my boyfriend, and things would be fine. They would then apologise to me, while making me feel bad at the same time. This went on until the end of the relationship. They would pick fights and gas light me, yell at me and then get angry or upset when I would yell beck, but call me a coward when I didn't. They constantly compared me to people who had sexually abused them in the past. I felt like I was never enough. 
At one point they needed to move out of home because of some circumstances, so I agreed and tried to find a place so we could move in together. We ended up house sitting together for a week, and after that week they went back home and told me they didn't want to move in together. Two days later showed up at my work trying to get me to come see a house with them for us to live in. This started a massive fight that ended I'm a breakup, which lasted for 20 minutes cause they 'didn't want to lose me'. I told them I didn't think moving in together was a good idea and they agreed. Until the next fight and they told me I never even tried and that I was a horrible person for not wanting to live together. We ended up breaking up two weeks later, but still shared a boyfriend. 
After I tried to mend things a month or so later, they abused me over text telling me I was disgusting and that they hoped I died. 
Skip to four months later, we decided to meet up and have coffee to talk things out. The whole time they told me I was horrible and everything that happened was my fault and they wanted to kill themself because of me. I decided to not talk to them because it wasn't going to work. My boyfriend then went through A similar thing which ended their relationship. They then sent me death threats and physically attacked my boyfriend, constantly tried to call and message us both and then showed up at my house after threatening to beat the crap out of me. 
Both me and my boyfriend have restraining orders against them, but I'm still constantly afraid, of seeing them, of it all happening again, and of the constant reminders of this person.
I don't know why I'm writing this on here, but I guess I would like some advice on what I should do to make the fear go away?",averyyyy20,2020-01-29 06:19:31,1,558,39.84,61.99,97.84,1.23,19.93,13.44,96.95,60.04,20.97,16.31,9.5,1.79,0,0.18,4.84,4.66,4.66,15.05,6.81,4.48,10.04,1.97,20.07,4.12,2.15,1.43,1.43,1.08,6.81,1.79,5.02,1.43,3.05,0.18,16.49,0.18,1.43,0.18,1.25,12.37,1.61,1.79,3.05,2.33,1.25,3.58,1.61,0.9,0.36,0.36,1.08,0.18,0.54,0.18,0.18,12.54,6.09,1.79,3.05,1.43,0.9,9.14,7.89,1.43,21.68,2.51,8.24,11.29,0.54,0.18,0.9,0,0,0.54,0.72,0.18,0,0,0,0,12.54,4.66,5.2,0,0,0.18,0,0,0,2.15,0.36,0
evruqi,Are my parents abusing me?,"I'm 15 F

She drags up stuff to scream about

like, ""don't you dare say we care more about your education than you ""

But she pressures me into school and when I call home because I'm chronicly ill and/or had an autistic meltdown she questions me relentlessly and then tells me that if I don't start completeling full days I will have to move back upstairs and lose all electronics and hobbies. I only call when lights and noise physically hurt and/or writing causes white hot pain

She constantly goes through my room when I'm gone, over a pillow on the floor then rearranges my stuff and yells at me for being lazy and unclean and a bitch, saying that she wasn't this bad at my age

I'm not aloud see my doctor by myself until I'm 18, even though the legal age here is 13 or 14. My dad says he's paying so he decides and there are many things I can't tell them because they would call me a liar or something similar

My dad is a liar. A 'recovering' alcoholic who's only meant to drink on weekends but I've seen cans appear over the week

He and my mom never admitted that he was an alcoholic because he wasn't violent

But he has dragged me down the stairs completely sober before because I didn't want to eat outside 

And in 2017 my mom spent 18 minutes screaming at me because I didn't want to go camping in France

evtis2,I almost hate them,"My brother and his wife were supposed to come over this weekend but they ended up canceling due to having to attend a memorial. And honestly? I could care less. I’m actually a little happy about it. Mainly cause I can’t stand either of them! Here’s my main reason why.

Towards the end of 2018, them, me and my father, all went to Myrtle Beach for like a week. Like I said in my last post, my dad has a drinking problem. Though he’s clearly in denial about it. As soon as we got there he went to buy drinks, like a bottle of whiskey and I think some vodka. But the next day? It was already gone and he was ready to buy more. I was very uncomfortable because I was sharing a room with him and had to be around him while he was in his boozed up state. I mentioned it to my sister in law, thinking she’d at least show me some sympathy. HUGE MISTAKE! 

She instead ended up telling my father behind my back what I’d said! Then he confronted me about it when my brother and her went into a store, after we’d gotten my dads precious alcohol, so we could be alone. I pretty much chose to say nothing in response to whatever my dad said, instead choosing to cry and the fact I’d been effectively screwed over. 

When the other two got back in the car my brother sarcastically said, “Glad to see you’re enjoying the trip!” And she didn’t say anything. Pretending it wasn’t happening.

Then when we got back to the hotel I was still crying and people got on the elevator with us. A lady complimented my outfit and I could only mutter a thank you through my tears. Now completely embarrassed. My dad then said, “You keep acting like that and I WILL get mad at you.” Since he’d mentioned in the car he didn’t want me to be afraid of him, and basically regarded my feelings as being stupid and uncalled for. Far too late for that!

So yeah the rest of the trip was an utter nightmare even though I pretended it wasn’t. If I ever go on a trip with them again, I think I’m just gonna make myself disappear. I was only 17 then anyway. I’m 19 now. I could do it so easy. They never pay attention or care about me anyway.

Either way I’ve somewhat despised my brother and his wife since then. Her in particular. So the fact they aren’t gonna be here this weekend, could mean less the than dog crap to me. Just like I, my safety, my comfort, and my overall life, mean to them. I could almost go so far as to say I hate them. But I won’t. That’d make me the bad guy.",testamentsofanguish,2020-01-29 13:21:45,0,482,19.5,41.79,89.19,10.17,11.76,12.45,96.06,63.28,22.41,18.88,11.41,1.04,0.83,3.73,1.87,3.53,5.19,13.9,9.13,9.96,8.71,1.87,19.09,5.19,3.73,1.24,0.83,2.28,7.47,3.11,4.36,0.62,1.87,0.83,13.9,2.7,0.41,1.87,4.98,13.9,2.49,2.07,2.07,2.49,1.66,4.15,2.49,0.62,1.66,0.21,1.87,0.21,0.41,0.21,1.24,6.43,3.11,0,1.45,1.24,0.62,6.85,8.3,2.07,16.18,3.11,6.22,7.26,0.41,2.07,0.21,0.83,0,0.21,1.45,0.41,0.41,0.21,0,0.41,17.01,6.85,3.73,0,0,0.41,1.04,0,0.83,4.15,0,0

If I remember it correctly CJ was asking me and my brother if we wanted to join his club, and for some reason, we wanted to. CJ told me and my brother that if we wanted to join his club me or my brother (I don't remember exactly) we would have to suck each other off. I was at an age where I didn't understand what that really meant. We did it, and CJ told us not to tell our parents. So he knew it was fucked up but he didn't care. My brother told our parents only because CJ said not to. All I remember after that is that the police were there, and CJ didn't go to juvie (I also don't know the youngest age that can go), he only went to his grandma's house because she was strict or some other dumb reason. I think that only happens because his dad was the sheriff or something. The memory only came back because I listened to a podcast called Silent Waves.

evw7a7,The hits just keep coming today!,"I’m getting ready to give away over 100 dollars to friends in hopes of going to a concert later this year. I’m already giving them less than they’ll probably need and I’ll have to give them more right after if so. Either way, I’m gonna have like 30 bucks left when that happens. Also I’m taking the money from savings it’s not even in my checking because it’s already down to 30. My dad mentioned wanting to go to Taco Bell and he asked if I’d be paying for myself or I expected him to. I said I wasn’t really gonna have any money and didn’t want to spend anymore. He proceeds to say, “Wow! That’s incredible! You’ll let me take you to the bank and pull out money for a stupid concert, but you want me to buy you dinner when I have 30 bucks to my name? That’s honestly selfish.” So now he says he’s not going at all as an obvious attempt to guilt trip me and make me the bad guy in the situation. So basically what we’ve learned here is I’m not allowed to spend money on anything I want/need without hearing about it later. Also, I mainly wanna go to this concert so I can get away from him! I am SO sick of this! Every time I mention being low on money and he has to buy me so much as anything, I get mocked and berated for it. But oh yeah let’s just forget the 200 dollars I’ve given him to pay my mom, whom he makes payments to every month. Which he’s also not giving back since he paid for my concert ticket last year, and that was me “paying him back” which I didn’t really agree to except for 100 dollars worth. Which was also my graduation money. Which is also completely gone already.

Let’s also just forget that he cries about being broke but somehow manages to buy alcohol literally every time we’re at the store! And I’m talking like spending 30-50 bucks or more on drinks every week. That adds up after awhile. And trust me, it’s been years! 

Let’s also forget the car payment I make every month which he originally agreed to pay half of which has been almost a year and NEVER happened! He chewed me out once for not paying it in full which I immediately did after that. He’s gonna be beyond pissed once I’m a couple weeks late on it this month. 

I am just so fu**ing sick and tired of being attacked for spending my own money on literally anything! It’s MINE! And he’s my PARENT! Yes I’m 19, but that doesn’t mean he should just feel the need to hover over me like a rabid dog just waiting to snap at me for buying something! I expect to pay for some things, I view it as a responsibility and that’s a good thing. But I do NOT expect to be degraded and mocked for my choices. I am NOT selfish! And I despise him for saying otherwise. Loving father and daughter relationship my a**! I could scream and cry simultaneously from the pure frustration.

ew061r,I need help with my abusive mother.,"I am a 17 year old girl. My parents are divorced and I live with my mom. My mom is extremely controlling and abusive. (She has physically hurt me ""accidentally"" before also) I am bipolar so I do get mad at her a lot and I can be very rude. I also used to be physical up until I was 13. Nothing extreme mostly pushing and pulling. I have also lost a lot of respect to her over the years which makes me care less. My first abusive memory of her was when I threw tantrums when I was maybe 7 or 9. She would sit on me till I would have trouble breathing and couldn't move to stop me. She weighs over 140 pounds. My second big memory was when she put me in a outpatient mental facility in seventh grade. I was actually quite well behaved in the facility but it made me feel isolated and crazy. I remember I went across the street with one of the teachers, to the inpatient mental hospital which scared me. We only went to get some avocados to make our guacamole with. I asked her if she thought I'd ever end up here. She smiled and said she didn't think I would. I told my mother later that day with joy and pride and I remember to this day her response was ""Well she doesn't know you like I do."" That broke me. When I was dating my first boyfriend I did something to my brother and my mom got mad and took my phone. I followed her to the bedroom trying to convince to not take it to which she responded, ""If you don't stop bothering me I'm going to break you and \*name up."" I had a panic attack. In June my nana died, but she wrote me a card for my birthday (which was in September) and it was given to me by mom. I read it in my room and cried quietly. I came out of my room and my mom asked if I read it. ""yeah."" I said calmly. ""Oh! I thought you would have had a bigger reaction to it."" I wanna get out but emancipation takes too long.",emb2002,2020-01-29 21:05:45,1,381,17.34,26.44,90.51,2.53,12.7,13.39,95.8,60.37,24.93,21.26,15.49,0.52,1.05,4.2,0,3.67,3.41,11.81,9.45,4.99,8.4,1.57,21.52,3.15,1.05,2.1,2.62,1.05,7.09,2.1,4.72,0.52,2.36,1.31,11.81,2.89,0.26,6.56,0.52,11.81,2.62,1.84,2.62,3.15,0.79,2.62,1.57,0,1.05,0.52,1.84,0.26,1.31,0,0.26,8.66,1.84,1.31,3.15,1.84,0.79,9.19,8.4,0.52,14.96,2.62,6.04,6.04,1.31,0,0.79,0,0,0.26,1.31,0,0,0.26,0.79,0,14.44,7.61,0.79,0,0,0,0.26,0,2.62,1.57,1.05,0.52

ew1k0v,Just writing it all out,"I was the middle of 3 children, had a sister a year older than me, and one 5 years younger. Growing up I was abused by my father. Not just physically. I remember he used to call me names, freak out on me. One time my mom took the 3 of us to get pictures taken at walmart when I was about 6 or 7 and when we got the pictures back my father freaked out, screaming at the top of his lungs that we look evil, and that he didnt believe I was his because my mother was ""such a whore"" (not true, shes an angel but he didnt give a shit) that he has no idea where I came from. I remember when I was 11 we were at some type of family BBQ and I was playing with the other kids and when I went up to my dad he said ""you think you're fucking cool eh fatboy. When we get home I'll show you how fucking cool you are"". 
I always remember those moments more then I do the beatings. The living in a whirlwind of shame and fear was almost worse than any physical pain. The beatings would happen all the time, but I can only seem to describe the few i have retold over the years, maybe as some type of mental defense. Like once he kicked me in my stomach until I pissed my pants for breaking something of his, and not ""looking like I gave a shit"". Another I remember being beaten so bad i missed the last 3 days of 3rd grade because of my bruises. I dont remember the beating very much, or what I did to encite it, all I remember was laying on the ground in my parents room because my mom felt bad for me and didnt want me to sleep alone. I remember him coming into the room, seeing me there and she said ""His face is all swollen, look what you did"" so he threw a bag of peas at my face and kicked me in the stomach. Then while walking away he pontificated on how I was such a piece of shit. 
From what I gathered he believed he should have had more out of life, and blamed us for holding him back. But specifically me, and my mom got it the worst. When I was 15 was the last time he hit me. I had a project for school that I was doing that I wanted to make a video for. I love making videos, I love the process, showing people. Well he had an idea to start a business, which he always had a new idea for one every few years, but he wanted me to do some type of work, like graphics or something for it. Now I was busy wanting to finish my project, so I told him no. He then lost his mind and just kept yelling. The thing with him is growing up he would yell for hours. Hauntingly just pontificating about how much he hates whatever he is mad about for hours. Swearing, screaming. Me and my little sister would hide in my room and just listen to him whole he would yell, hit my mom, go crazy, unplug the phones. So at 14 I had enough, and basically got in a fist fight with him. He held me against the wall while I tried punching him and he punched me 3 times in the face, then threw me to the ground. After that I hated him for a while. Not like I did while I was growing up. While I was growing up I was more afraid of him. I would hide knives around the house knowing if he tried to hurt me I would just stab him. I used to lay in bed wishing he would die. And my mom stayed with him. All along. Would cry when I got beat, or she got beat. But treated like it was just what the cards we were dealt. 
Eventually i forgave him and we moved on in a different way. I was now more an adult, so the issues were much different issues. I was popular at school, I won the student counsel elections, bla bla, so now he didnt feel as valid I was a piece of shit only because other people liked me. People only liked me because i had a sense of humor from having such a fucked up life at home. But i didnt go to school to work hard, or learn. I only went to make friends, and have fun. I felt like the balance of being a normal person was always off for me. I always looked to be soothed, or looked to do the most fun or stress free thing, in my mind to compensate knowing I definitely wouldnt be able to relax at home. Even if I wasnt the brunt of my father's anger anymore, it was still there. The amount of times through the years my dad came home drunk at 4 am screaming at my mother calling her a whore and hurting her I cant count. Plus, I was only out of the dog house temporarily. 
After high school he had another business that he wanted me to help him with. Again, graphic design, computer work. I was never good at web development, or any kind of coding, but I had some knowledge of it. So when i would do his website, i did it on what i know which is design and he would always tell me ""who gives a shit if it's pretty if it doesnt function. You dont know how to make anything function."" Which he did with everything. There was always an explanation of why the things that I felt were talents were invalid or unimpressive. Maybe some people can rise above this, but he has always been the voice in my head. I've always believed deep down I'm not like others, in that I'm actually inherently less. I have moments of confidence, but there is this underlying feeling that my father was right, and I'm just garbage. 
So I stepped away from working with him for awhile and got a job of my own. One that I was proud of because it was a position that didnt exist, that they decided they needed because of skills that I possessed. I had that job for 3 years while I lived with my then girl friend. 
Fast forward to me and her ending. There was some abuse there too. Not what I experienced, but stuff that I guess normal people would not tolerate or consider livable. I was ashamed, but I was 23 and decided to just start going wild. Drinking every night, parties, different girls all the time, and still going to work at 7 am 5 days a week. It wasnt a time of my life I was proud of decision wise, but at least I was ambitious, social, and positive. 
Then one night my little sister dies in a car accident. So I moved back home with my parents. That lasted 3 months until my Dad went crazy one night and I moved in with friends. After living with them for a few months, I was motivated by some tribute projects that I wanted to do for my sister, and became obsessed with the idea of life after death, and developed PTSD and derealization and lost my job.
In the process of doing the projects I had for my sister I met my now fiance. Within about 4 months we were pregnant. We got our own place. All the while, I was completely unmotivated to work, find work, or even try. I wanted to work from home to do my own business but I couldn't stay focused. All my life I feel focus has been such an issue. I definitely have ADHD. 
So we were doing anything we could to get by. She was still going to school, so her student loan covered us for a while. I have no idea what I did with that time. 
A few months in and mirrors to my childhood started appearing on me, as I had become the monster who haunted my dreams. I missed the birth of my son because I was arrested for assault. I dont even remember enough to tell you what happened. That's not a cop out, I just dont know. I can recall grabbing by the arm, and throwing on a bed, and other inappropriate stuff, but when the police confronted me with what they were told I was genuinely shocked. There's 2 sides to every story, and maybe I did or didnt do those specific things I was being accused of, but I did know I was wrong. But at the time, all I saw was someone who tried to hurt me. So when everything was over and we got back together, the shit from me didnt stop. Angrier and more abusive. With my second time arrested I just wanted to do it right. I couldn't stop the anger from coming, and I didnt want this to be who I was. My dad always got away with it, but I couldn't. 
So I went to anger management and counseling. Never once did I mention my past abuse with my father. I dont know why. I just didnt think it would help, and I wanted to take accountability for myself. I was afraid to start trying to look for work incase my record showed up on a background check so I started working for my dad again, for his new restaurant. 
It was really me going in everyday and having him remind me what I piece of shit I am. I acted in a way that I knew wouldnt piss him off, and most of the time we were very friendly with each other. I became much more cynical in the process of just being around him. 
I had 2 more children, each a year apart. Everyday I find myself barely making through the day, emotionally. I start to feel good, and then they start screaming or yelling about something and I feel like such a loser because my instinct is to curl up in a ball or leave. I feel like I should be motivated to be better by being around my kids, but I dont most of the time. In fact I feel very little actually motivates me now. 
Me and my Dad had a big blowout before Christmas, about me wanting to have Christmas eve with my family and him telling me I was such a loser and I should work more for him to support my kids. 
Hes right, but I just couldn't work for him anymore. So I have been home the last month or so trying to start up my own business. But again, the sounds of the kids crying and screaming, and also the innate need that i feel to just lay around and be comfortable. 
I feel like if i do anything i have to do it at the most extreme, to have a challenge. If I diet, i have to not eat anything for 13 days, if i start going to the gym i have to go at 530 in the morning. I'm just trying to make things as hard as possible for myself to motivate myself, I guess. 
I dont know what to do. Because I want to focus, and get my work done to start making money for my family, but I cant get myself motivated to actually do it. 
I cant fix what's wrong with me. I dont feel worthy of the beautiful kids I have, or my fiance who is literally only supportive, telling me to take my time. I'm just a failure in every regard, and all I have is a sad shitty story.
Why cant I rise out of this? Why do some people come out to be great from being abused as a kid, but I just get comfortable in my own lazy shit? I'm fucking disgusted with myself and I dont know what else to do, or what extreme step to take to try. 

I dont know what I'm getting out of writing all this, but I know I have never tried writing all of it before. I hope something can save me.

ew1kmw,My friends say its very obvious I was traumatized,"tl;dr: i've been through a lot of shit and some of it my roommates and best friend know

I always thought that I hid my trauma pretty well most of the time, especially since my de facto response is to dissociate if I feel any strong emotions or if I am having trauma reactions in public. 

I found out the other day that apparently if someone talks to me for long enough they can tell that I am very, very obviously traumatized and I don't know how to feel about that. Apparently my roommates and best friend all could tell something was up from our first meetings- and I met all of them as an adult, though one of them I met a few months before I escaped. 

The idea that people can just tell there's something wrong with me is actually terrifying but in someway it's validating, like maybe I'm not making it all up in my head. But mostly,  I just don't want people to tell that I've been through shit without me telling them. 

A lot of my identity is wrapped up in being the 'strong one' but the things they mentioned- that I'm very soft spoken, that I don't talk about my family or childhood very often, that I stand and sit hunched over, that I flinch a lot and watch peoples' hands, and so on, kinda feels like an antithesis to that.

ew2jkg,Abuse by mother,"TLDR at bottom

Warning: mention of drugs and alcohol, pedophiles, swearing and emotional abuse and neglect

Sorry this is long and all over the place i just need to let it out. (Im on mobile)

I can say this since i was kicked out and moved in with a friends mum but it still kinda affects me (im 18F)

Im just gonna use dot points tbh.


•life was fine before i was 12-13 yrs old

•i have a little sister whos 2 yrs younger

•grew up without a dad cause mother left him and hes was a alcholic

•moved at 12-13 cause she suddenly got engaged. started being woken up at midnight twice a week to go to motels or her friends houses and to be woken up early so we could get to school on time


•claimed she was being hit by new boyfriend but never saw signs, but i still believed her (till now)

•she left him and we stayed at one of her friends houses for half a year till she got a house

•at that house her addiction to drugs appeared. 

•she started having strangers ( at least to le and my sis) stay with us

•she would leave at random times of the day and night mostly without telling us so we got used to it.

•she started to lock herself in her room and it would take us ages to even get her attention

•in that house the bathroom had two doors, one connected to the hallway and the other to her bedroom so ofc it was also locked and he couldnt even shower in our own house and if we managed to open it there was no hot water.

•i opened it oncr to she her sticking needles in her arm

•she got a new boyfriend was clearly a druggo as well

•my mum came home to or woke up to said boyfriend high on ice trying to hang himself in her room and screamed and my sister woke up to the screaming and saw that now she still has nightmares from it (its been a year or two)

•my mum would claim to ""clean"" my room but all she ever did was rearange stuff, leave all the rubbish, break my stuff and ""lose"" my stuff, she did this multiple times over the years and everytime i would (tbh) have a tantrum, because i begged her not to everytime before and after and i would have a mental breakdown bawling my eyes out and she would just call me a selfish entitled bitch and lock herself in her room again, and (the part im not proud of) i would try to and threaten to bash her door down (i never did tho) and she started to go on calling me abusive. (Which is why i started to not believe her) she didnt clean my sisters room once and she wven asked her to so i think ahe only did my room out of spite or something

•one time when she was going  from her room to the front door to leave again (somethimes she gone for 8 hrs and she littlerally never answers her phone) she had to put her shoes on which she left in the loungeroom and my sister saw it as her only chance to tell her she was suicidal months before and tried or was super close to trying to kill herself, i then heard my mother scream sayingthat my sister is trying to blame her for it, that shes selfish and shes not part of the family anymore, my mum then left and my sis came crying to me.

•Ive woken up to police in the house( not raiding it just asking where ppl are)

•i have woken up to the police raiding the house, and the first thing i see after the front glass door shattering was a gun and being screamed out to get down, i was calm when it happened but bawled my eyes out after then had nightmares for like a week.

•Eventually we were kicked out and had to go to someone elses house and sleep on their floor for a while

•While we were moving the house burned down ( only house touched by fire on the street so it was on purpose) no one was in it but were not sure if it was the owner of the house or the druggo ex boyfriend (she kept breaking up and getting together with him) most likely the ex cause of a bunch of hints but not enough proof.

•after we left the other friends house( he was my mothers age round 40, he sent messages to my sister trying to hook up with her, luckily my mum cared enough to keep him away from the house and report him to the cops

•Moved away

•had someone crawl thru my sisters window to steal stuff (she wasnt there luckily)

•guys with baseball bats ( we have antigun laws thankfully) attacked the house again in the middle of the night but this time my sister and one of her friends were there, and this happened after they all were threatened saying that ""they were going to be killed and shoved into barrels over cocaine"" 

•at that point i was kicked out (over a stupid reason that i couldnt physically do, and she called my a selfish bitch and other names for about half an hour or less before i swore at her back, days later as i was moving my stuff out she claimed that she loved me and wanted me to move back in but she already started to break what was left and already started storing her stuff in there and i already knew that i would be mentally and physically safer sleeping on the street in a neighborhood that isnt that good.

•when she told me what happened it scared me enough to threaten to call childservices and my sister got angry at me for saying that since she was the only parent we had

• everyone always said i was overreacting when i complained about it (except my friends cause she upset one of them) 

•we got reunited with our dads side of the family cause i dad is no longer a alcholic  (still drinks a tiny bit i think) and my sister's gonna move with them in another state cause our mother is currently homeless and my sister refuses to to be inbetween house with strange adult men and druggos, and i think she should too and i might aswell.

•im not sure if i should disown her only my friends dont think im over reacting and that im a cold hearted bitch

ew75kc,I’m not sure if I was sexually assaulted/molested,"Hello all. Last semester I took a STEM program at my school to advance my programming skills. In this class, I was the only girl. It started off not being a problem. I was able to blend in because of my more male aligned interests like video Games and comics books. However the environment in class became kinda violent? Hitting each other was super common in class. I didn’t mind that too much even if it hurt allot sometimes, like the time I got kicked in the crotch. I guess one of the guys took my lenience with hitting as an OK to touch me however he wanted. He touched my boobs and my ass. The worst time I remember was when her grabbed my ass in front of the class. I did tell him to stop but I guess my tone wasn’t serious enough because he didn’t really stop. He also tended to make crass remarks that made me uncomfortable, like asking to watch me and my girlfriend have sex or join us. He said stuff like I should expect this from being friends with men but I don’t know. He just made me feel super violated and dirty. I told my therapist about this and a few friends. I’m not really sure what this would be called. Did I get assaulted or is this common behaviour?",V3NU5G14L,2020-01-30 07:35:17,5,237,26.99,8.2,74.2,6.77,12.47,14.35,95.78,55.7,21.52,16.46,12.66,0.42,0,3.38,0,5.06,4.64,10.97,8.44,4.64,7.59,2.95,18.57,4.64,2.95,0.84,0.42,2.53,6.75,2.53,4.22,0.42,1.69,0.42,9.7,0,1.69,0.84,4.22,16.46,1.69,2.11,2.95,3.8,1.27,7.17,3.8,0.84,0.84,2.11,2.95,1.69,0.42,1.27,0,9.28,2.95,2.11,0.84,2.11,1.69,10.13,6.33,0.42,9.7,0.84,4.22,3.8,4.22,1.69,0,0,0,0,2.11,1.27,0.42,0.42,0,0,11.81,6.75,1.27,0,0,0.84,0,0,0,2.53,0,0.42

ewhnp2,My dad messaged me to blame me for his impending suicide.,"Last week my dad took his bullshit up a notch by sending me a message in the middle of the day to tell me he was going to kill himself and it was my fault.

Mid last year I finally committed to cutting him and his extended family off, I blocked him and told him I no longer wanted to hear from him. Then early this year I had to get a new phone and forgot to block his number, he messaged me last week telling me that what I had done was disgusting and vicious, that I was just brainwashed by my ‘dumb skank’ of a mother (I’m 31). That all the things I had accused him and his family of doing never happened and I was out of control. 

He then said he was going to kill himself so I would be happy. 

I called my brother (29) who is the only one of us who still speaks to him, we also have an older sister, I was pretty distraught and also feeling incredibly guilty for bringing my little brother into it. He called him, he didn’t answer, he kept calling and no answer (he lives somewhere extremely remote so not like he can just be checked up on). Eventually he answered and laughed saying he was just fucking with me the way I fiucked with him. 

I know I shouldn’t care, I’ve blocked him on my new phone, my brother has now ended contact but fuck every now and then I think about it and feel sick.

I hate him.",Wotcha-,2020-01-30 18:59:47,3,274,12.79,69.53,39.11,1.12,24.91,14.6,95.26,62.77,27.37,22.99,12.04,0.73,0,10.22,0,4.01,3.65,11.31,8.76,6.2,7.3,2.19,18.61,4.38,1.46,1.09,1.09,0.73,6.2,1.46,4.74,0.73,2.92,0,21.53,3.28,0.36,0.73,12.04,7.66,2.55,0.36,1.09,0.73,1.82,1.09,3.28,0,2.55,0.73,1.82,0.36,0.73,0.73,0,6.2,4.01,0,1.09,0.73,0.36,9.12,7.66,2.55,14.96,1.46,5.47,8.03,0,0.73,0.73,0,0,1.09,1.82,1.82,0,0,0,0,11.68,4.01,3.28,0,0,0,0,0,0.36,1.82,2.19,0

ewj7tx,"Can't sleep, it's all too much","It is currently 04.23am when I began typing this. I have been trying to sleep, but can't. Even ended up nodding off, but still being unable to sleep! It's a really weird experience. And this is why.

Firstly, here's a bit of a backstory (read my other posts on other subreddits if you really want to be filled in on everything). So, I have to see my ex every Wednesday. There's no way around it, unless she transfers Units, which she refuses to do. We had been getting along a bit better recently, to the point that she openly told me it's her time of the month on Wednesday. She told me, cuz she needed pads. So I got her some.

Yesterday, I went shopping in town for a few bits. Decided that, whilst I was at KFC, I would get her a Krushem. You know, just to help her through her period, as a kind gesture. That was basically it. Just a drink. I had been texting her in the day just to ask what kinda mood she's in (chewy candy or chocolate). It didn't matter, cuz KFC have removed Skittles Krushems.

Delivering the drink! She told me earlier, that she was at her grandparents', which is on the way home. However, she then texted me that she was home, which I replied ""okay, I'll pop by there then"". No big deal, I only have to go a little further. As far as I knew, her other grandparents had taken her home. She failed to mention that her dad actually took her home (her mother and father are just as bad as each other. Terrible parents, terrible people, scum of the Earth).

So...I knock on the door, he answers, I give him the drink with no emotion and explain who it's for. He asked why, so I answered, without stating that she's on her period. He then asks her if she wants it.....the dumbass obviously didn't think that she obviously already knew. I wouldn't just turn up without warning, with a drink.

This is where it gets heated

He steps outside, gets up in my face and starts threatening me. I made it very obvious to him that I ain't scared, and honestly...it was the funniest thing I had seen in ages. He looked so fucking defeated the rest of this story (apparently he told his own daughter he was gonna kill himself, after the story...yeah. That fact came from the daughter). Anyway! He threatened me over some lies my ex's mother has been spreading, and my ex has been encouraging. I said ""okay"", then as he walked away, I said ""do I need to call the police?"" He said something, but he didn't turn around to say it. My ex said something as well, but I didn't listen, cuz I already know what she'd say. But I'm not letting her think that when I say I'll call the police, I actually won't. So I did.

He followed me half way to the car, where I was going to retrieve my phone to call them. My ex threw the biggest tantrum, just because her parents did bad shit and were gonna have to face the consequences. I ignored her calls and texts, because the police advised.

When I got to read the texts, she was angry at me, then she calmed down. She told me it's not my fault (obviously, I know. I took a drink to her...), but it also wasn't her dad's fault. Now THAT is still playing on in my mind. How can you say that, when you've JUST witnessed him threaten me, while you stood there watching?

She sticks up for them, making up excuses for them even when they've JUST had a go at her for not doing what THEY want her to do FOR THEM. It's not just shit like that, it's emotional abuse as well. He calls her fat, and she defends him. Her mum takes the piss out of her favorite hobbies, constantly, and she defends her. All I've ever done is be there for her, defend her and take care of her. This is what I get.

Too much shit, too much stress. It can never be her parents' fault. It's always mine, cuz I didn't let them bully me and abuse me how they like",Dregar12,2020-01-30 21:01:43,1,737,8.36,62.76,28.01,2.27,12.71,12.62,95.79,64.18,26.73,19.4,8.14,0.14,0.68,9.36,1.09,7.33,4.48,11.26,10.58,8.01,7.87,2.85,21.03,3.66,2.17,2.58,0.41,1.76,6.51,1.76,4.48,0.68,2.04,0.14,18.86,1.76,0,7.46,3.26,11.4,1.49,1.76,1.22,1.36,1.63,4.61,2.04,0.54,1.36,0,2.58,1.36,0.14,0.14,1.22,7.19,1.09,0.68,2.85,1.76,1.9,8.96,10.04,1.63,13.84,2.44,6.24,5.16,1.22,1.09,0.68,0.14,0,0.14,3.12,0.81,0.95,0.41,0.27,0.14,24.29,9.23,7.6,0,0,0.27,0.41,0,0.81,4.61,1.36,0

ewqyay,Afraid for my best friend,"My best friend(16F) and her ex boyfriend(18M) broke up in June 2019 after a year and a half of dating. He was extremely abusive. She wasn't allowed to ride the fucking bus, go anywhere except to school and sometimes grab a cup of coffee with ONLY ME and nobody else. He called her disgusting names and threatenedto beat her. He also threatened to kill our whole class. And she still stayed with him. Even though she was on fucking medications because of him. In May he moved to another city 2 hours away and she would visit him without her parents knowing. One day he didn't let her go home. He locked her in his room and she wasn't allowed to call anyone. The next day her mother called the police and they separated them while he was shouting and threatening to KILL HER AND HER FAMILY. He was reported but nothing came out of it. Ever since then he's been constantly texting her that he will come here and kill her and her loved ones(including me)/ or that he loves her and that she is his forever, and no matter how many times she blocks him he always makes another profile. Last monday it would have been their 2 years anivercery. On wednesday night he came in front of her apartment high on drugs and alchohol(he did that while they were dating too). He screamed and cried and written on the walls of the building in front of her doors. He also left her a letter in which he wrote everything he writes in the texts(you are mine forever i love you ect). She went to the police with her mom the next day and filed a report but i doubt that they'll do anything. She has a little 8 year old brother and she's frequently alone with him. He literally has nothing to lose he doesn't have a normal family or friends or school he is only interested in her. He is fucking sick. I' ve been seriously thinking about killing him. I don't know how to fucking help her.

ewtxfw,"No, you are not “only human”, you did not “make a mistake”.","That’s an abusers go-to excuse when they get called out on their abuse: they made a “mistake”. Abuse is never a mistake, it’s intentional. They know that. Especially when they are a repeated abuser, how does someone keep making the same “mistake” over and over again? They want to force you to see their humanity, when they afforded their victims no humanity and allowed them no space to make mistakes. If you don’t forgive the abusers for their so-called “mistakes” then they say YOU are the monster, you are in the wrong, you’re just as bad as them, they’ve moved on why haven’t you?

I told my dad I remember her doing things to me when I was little and he just told me ""what u remember is probably right I used to tell myself what ur mother was doing wasn't true but after a while I realized it was"" 

My mom was emotionaly abusive after the physical abuse luckly I've gotten away from her through my parents divorce.

ewzjx4,I don't know if I'm abusive,"Long post, sorry

I've been with my fiance fir almost 6 years and he always makes me feel like I'm abusive but I don't even know how to describe it anymore, one example is tonight we were in the kitchen and he wrapped his arms around me from behind but his hands were wet and I HATE when people touch me when they are wet, I don't know I just always have so I shrugged him off and told him why and then he flicked water in my face so I went to jokingly kick him in the butt as he left the kitchen but he put his hand in front and I accidentally kicked his hand (he just got stitches out like a week ago) and hurt him. He turned around and I thought he was going to hit me (which he never has) but I instinctively backed away because of how mad he looked and then he threw my cup of water on me and walked out of the kitchen and got into the shower. 

But what makes me feel bad is in the past well play fight and I've hurt him by accident when he tickled me and stuff like that or I'll lightly hit his arm when he says/done something stupid and I've stopped doing all of that because he started saying I was an abusive person and that I abused him. I didn't see it as that but maybe I did? I don't know because growing up that's just how me and my family were, we play fought and lightly hit each other on the arm or leg when we were being stupid or funny but it never hurt. But even when we are messing around and he started it sometimes he'll just tell me that I'm abusing him.

ex299d,How do you talk to your friends about having been abused?,"I grew up in an immigrant family in the midwest. My father physically and psycologically abused me, my brothers and my mother. She was afraid that if people found out our family would be torn apart, that my father would leave us, generally she thought that if we told people about what was happening that things could only get worse. She meant well but it also allowed the abuse to continue.  


I am now at the doorstep of 30 and only in these last few years have I come to reckoning with what happened. I have made a lot of progress with therapy, but I still don't know how to talk about it outside of that context. It feels important to share the truth with the people I trust but I don't know where to start. I don't know what I would say. I just know that I am tired of lying about myself to the people I care about and I don't want to maintain this painful silence. The problem is that I still carry so much of the fear that I learned as a child that if I speak bad things will happen.

ex4h9y,Was I abused by my father before I could remember?,"So... This is not something I wish to write, but I need an anonymous safe place.

So yeah, I am a female above my mid twenties and in therapy for almost all my life for several reasons. Panic, depression, autism, eating disorder.

Lately I have been in therapy which has brought back a lot of memories from the past... Including some of my father. My father and I haven't been getting along very well for most of my life, but we are getting along alot better now. But now that these memories/vague clues/feelings are putting me in chokehold.. I have no clue what to do or feel.

There are these things that I can't place:
- when i was a little kid, I was always scared of fathers in general. I avoided them.
- He comes from a family where abuse was in the picture (aware that this doesn't have to be an indicator)
- I have been having nightmares/odd flashback memories of him in sexual context that I cant place.
- I barely have any memories of my childhood. Like almost none at all.
- I still have problems hugging him.
- I was always terrified about him seeing me naked, when I was in the bathroom for instance.
- When I was tested for my autism, we talked about the fear of men and fathers in general when I was a kid... When we walked out of the hospital he asked: ""Did I ever abuse you or something when you were a kid?"" .. I think that it's the oddest thing one could say.
- He often said weird sexual things when I was a kid/teenager.
- When I got older I fell into relationships of abuse in any type of form.

Honestly, there is much more I could say... But i am really hoping that someone might have experienced something similar (well, I hope no one has experienced this, but I hope you know what i mean). Or that someone could tell me that i am not crazy. I am losing my mind. I am discussing this with my therapist on monday, but I needed to vent this.

ex5yyt,"BF(26M) broke in my google drive to download my entire chat history backup since 2017. He threw me (30F) out, called me names and made false accusations. What should I do?","[UPDATE] This post is moved from r/relationship as admin advised. Thank you all for your kind, reassuring words and support if you have already seen and commented on this post. 

I need strength to break it off.  I love(d) him and what happened seems so surreal to me.  I still want to believe he is not a bad person, and what he did was out of fear, weakness and (sick) love. I am not justifying his behaviour nor do I think it is acceptable. This all is traumatising to me but I cannot cancel/erase the sweet moments we shared just like this. 

I need help. Can anyone recommend me online therapist services? Thank you. 



BF(26M) of ~1.5 years creeped me out by downloading and reading my entire chat history since 2017. He now calls me (30F) names and accused me of “sleeping around” as well as giving him STIs. What do I do?

We met in 2018 autumn and fell instantly in love and have been together since. 

We had some bumps in the relationship but have been otherwise very close. BF(26M)has once confessed to me he feels insecure with me(30F), as I am older and more experienced. 

Yesterday he woke me up and out of the blue asked me to leave his place yet refused to say why. It turned that he logged into my Google drive after I went to bed and downloaded my entire WhatsApp chat history backup since 2017 to his phone and read it all. 

He was furious at the texts, chats and flirts that I exchanged with guys long before I got to know him. And he started calling me slut and accusing me of “sleeping around”. In 2017 I was travelling for work a lot globally and maybe as a result not able to develop a stable relationship in either country I most frequent. I was single but was talking to a number guys I met on dating apps. However, I did not sleep around. (Even I reviewed my own chat history and noticed how I mostly flirted but found all sorts of reasons postponing an actual date). Maybe it’s a mixture of boredom, loneliness and some real intention to date someone. Some conversations did lead to a date which did not develop. Although I wasn’t proud of some heavy flirt and sex talks, I don’t find anything wrong with it, as I was single and adult. BF called me names and falsely accuse me of having a series of ONS. I did not. I have had guy who ghosted me after sex, yes, which I was and am feel hurt about and did not share this with BF. Even if I did, it’s not fundamentally wrong as I was single.  He dated round and slept with 10+ girls (according to him) before me. 

Furthermore, he accused me of giving him STIs and saying he “probably” got herpes (he doesn’t have a doc’s diagnosis). He made the same accusation last year as well.  I made him see a doctor, who then confirmed that he was clean. 
He never apologised for terrorising me with the accusation. Yesterday he made the accusation again. I am sure I don’t have any STIs as I just went to doctors last month and I have been exclusive with him since we started dating. 

There is absolutely no reason for any suspicions of infidelity during our relationship. The only thing I can think of that may have triggered is our conversation about open relationship 2 days ago. He wanted to go overseas for a semester or internship and was pushing me to agree to allow him f**k around. I told him it could be possible if certain mutually accepted rules are in place. We didn’t reach any agreement by the end of the negotiation. That’s why I suspected him to have snooped around my chat history to find incriminating matters so that he could push further for what he wanted. 

I now feel very violated, humiliated, wronged, angry and sad. I don’t think I did anything wrong nor should I apologise to him for anything. I do however want to get a full STIs test result to put in his face so that he doesn’t drag my name through mud.

Just two days ago I was so convinced about him and wanted to marry him. But now I felt so creeped out that he abused my trust and violated my privacy in such a way - maybe snooping in my phone is one thing but breaking into Google drive to download my chat backup from 3 years ago is creepy at a new level. 

I still don’t think I did anything wrong and there is nothing I should apologise for. I’d like to get a full STI screening though and show him the medical report so that he does not drag my name through mud. 

I feel very humiliated, wronged, angry and sad. Moreover, I feel very confused. Did I overthink this as his power move? Or he just wanted to find a reason to break up in the ugliest way? Should I just let go of this relationship ? Please advise. What would you do in my shoes.

ex74wh,I don't feel safe going back to my mom's.,"For the past year I've been living with my best friend because my mom is abusive and I haven't been able to live in her house without us constantly fighting and horrible situations happening. I just genuinely hate her as a person, her morals, the way she thinks. 

I love it her. I feel like im part of a family. My best friend's mom treats me like the mom I always always wanted. It's so cozy, the house is beautiful. I have grown so much here. 

Her mom has been trying to help me and her get back on track, and she swears shes better. But ever time I see her it's something else. I'm so so fucking scared to go back and that's all I've been thinking about. Everyone thinks it's time. 

Her mom got her to completely redo my room because it's in the basement full of mold and I have a severe allergic reaction to mold. So she painted it a yellow I picked and she's going to rip the carpet and put hard floor. She also gave me her old bed set. I feel so fucking stupid. She's trying.. I'm just asking for too much. 

I just know it's going to be horrible when I go back there. I don't want to feel like that again. I've already been slipping so far back. But in such a weird way I want to go back now so I can do what I want and not have to worry about people, no one cares about me when I'm there. 

She asked me to babysit last night, my brother and his friends, so I said yes. I got there and her room, the room I sleep in as mine is under construction and no furniture is in it, was fucking padlocked. Best friend's mom asked why and she started screaming at all of us about how I walk around doing and saying whatever the fuck I want and don't think about other people. Excuse me? Who the fuck left me in a house with no place to sleep and didn't even bother to tell me before hand. She then proceeded to tell me that my mattress was in the storage room (freezing ass garage) and I could use it. The sheets and blankets were in her room. Guess who has a sleep disorder, forgot their clonadine, and didn't sleep tonight! Fucking me. I probably wouldn't have been able to anyway. I just feel so fucking unwelcomed. And she doesn't even care. 

Her and best friend's mom bonded over me and my mom's broken relationship, and she realized she had someone so she said ""fuck mTZippo"" and decided to use her for other things. Shes so fake, she's using her. It makes me so angry. 

I feel so fucking sick and selfish that I turned my best friends life and her mom's into this. They shouldn't have to deal with any of this. Of trying to get me to fucking leave, of dealing with my mom, dealing with my breakdowns. I just feel so fucking worthless and a waste of space.

ex7lem,Idk what to do rn,"I keep having thoughts of something that happened. I dont like talking about it so I dont. But my brains been doing that thing where it remembers something and wont stop. Last year I was in therapy and my therapist said when it gets like this use this time to face what happened if I can but I cant. 

I get to the part where his hands are on me and its like my brain just shuts down. All I can think is ""stop""over and over in my head and i have a moderate panic response (moderate as in my heart rate significantly rises and my breathing feels impaired but I'm not throwing up and generally able to hold it together on the outside) 

I'm not ready to go back to therapy and I dont wanna tell my fiance as he worries a lot and this is stuff I haven't really talked about yet because I CANT. It's been like this for the last couple months almost every day. 

I have to go to the doctor and get a pap. How am I supposed to do that with this in my head? I dont know why it affects me so much. People have been through worse. I feel so weak and so alone and I dont know what to do. I just want it to be like it never happened.

exa6gf,How to get help for childhood sexual abuse when one of the people who hurt you was a former therapist that used your trauma to hurt you more?,"I was sexually abused by two individuals in two different phases of my life. One when I was 7 years old at a summer camp by a camp counselor for a duration of 2 weeks, and another when I was 17 by a therapist though for him the grooming process started at 17 but the abuse didn't start till 18. That lasted a year and a half and he was also married. So yeah, I technically consented and at the time thought i was in control. I wasn't. 

I have a deep distrust for authority and for anyone in the field of psychology but mostly i hate myself for allowing myself to be so easily manipulated. I have a lot of deep issues but I don't know what to do. I'm terrified to go see a female therapist and have to tell her that the reason i'm there is because i was the side piece of my last therapist. But i'm lost. I have no idea what healthy intimacy feels like and the self hate is killing me. I want to get help but I'm terrified.

exj7fd,Wanting to speak to my aggressive and unpredictable brother but want to keep myself safe.,"I got into a relationship with our cousin (22 at the time) at 15. I was dealing with being ostracised by my family and community after I got abused so I found ""love"" in the only person who would treat me like a person. He was controlling and abusive so I left when I turned 18.

My brother was furious. He didn't speak to me for 10 years and if we did bump into each other he would get violent.  My younger brother, who was a child at the time, was never really told anything. He said to me recently that he's been struggling with the idea of having someone in his life who had done something so awful that it made the family turn their back on me. 

The conversation went
Him - What did you do?
Me - I got into a relationship with x.
Him - So?
Me - You know he was our cousin right? I got into a relationship with our cousin.
Him - So? You were a child. Why would they hate YOU for that?

It shook me a little. Got me thinking, ""actually, yeah! Why was he (my older brother) so angry with me? It was wrong, sure, but why was he so violent? Why did my mum and family act like this was a proportionate response?"" I get the impression my brother resented me for leaving. We were all close at the time and mum had a hard time after I left. But still?

My older brother and I finally started speaking again 4 years ago and now we have a pretty good relationship. I want to ask him why he was so angry with me all those years but I'm worried about his reaction. If I write a letter he'll stop reading at the first line and go back to not speaking to me. I don't feel like I'll get an answer from him unless I ask him in person. 

But I need to ask him this for closure.

Do I just accept I won't get the answers I'm looking for?

exjbzf,I’m so confused,"(16 F) I don’t know if I’m being emotionally abused by my mom or if I’m just making it up in my head. I have seven siblings and I am the younger middle child and all my older siblings don’t seem to be affected liked me and my younger siblings are. My parents got divorced when I was 9-10. I’m guessing that’s when all the bad things started happening, and my older siblings (each born two years apart) were old enough to not be affected? What has been happening is that my mom shouts at me and calls us names and has never been emotionally available in the sense that I’ve never been able to have a real relationship with her and feel safe to talk to her about anything. She does buy food and drives me places and I’m kind of a burden when it comes to driving her places and she gets mad at me about it. Even as I’m typing this though, I feel like it’s not true and I’m making it up even though I know it’s happened. Two years ago I came out to my mom as a lesbian and she wasn’t mad or anything but she told me to never tell anyone and that it would ruin my reputation and the reputation of the family and I didn’t feel like she accepted it, and I don’t even accept myself. There is another thing that happened in January when we were at church(my mom always makes excuses to not go to church but sends us there anyways and she just started going again). There wasn’t enough room in the pew she chose to sit in so she sent me to sit in the back(where there was enough room for all of us). Near the end she passed by where I was sitting and I flinched and she got mad at me. When we got home she was upset at how I reacted and said how everyone at church would think that me and my mom have a bad relationship and was just really mad at me. I also have to emotionally parent my youngest sister and my other younger sister, but the other younger sister doesn’t listen. It’s not like we’ve never had enough food or something at home but there have been a lot of things that I have looked past that have made me feel really bad that I am now just realizing might have been abuse. It’s not always like this, which is why I’m thinking it’s all in my head. I’m afraid to seek help because I hate myself for being gay and I feel like (I’m gonna sound crazy but it’s a legitimate fear) some therapist will convince me that it’s not a bad thing, but then I will go to hell for being gay when I die. I don’t know what to do and I don’t know if I’m just sensitive to things that all other kids go though. There’s a lot more to this story and if someone thinks that it’s not in my head, I’ll add to this post in the comments or something.",Tincan10x,2020-02-01 21:01:43,1,532,3.16,15.95,97.22,2.51,28,10.15,96.43,65.23,24.62,15.41,11.65,1.13,0,2.63,0,9.21,3.38,10.9,13.91,8.08,10.9,3.76,24.44,3.57,3.01,2.63,1.13,2.26,4.51,0.94,3.57,0.75,1.5,0.19,10.71,3.01,0,4.32,0,16.92,3.38,2.07,1.13,4.14,2.44,6.2,2.07,0.19,0.75,0.94,1.69,0.56,0.19,0.56,0.38,6.77,4.14,0.19,0.75,0.94,0.94,7.14,14.47,1.32,15.04,2.26,6.2,6.58,0.19,0.19,0.94,0.19,0.94,0.19,0.56,0.19,0.19,0,0,0.19,12.97,3.2,1.32,0,0,0.19,0,0.19,0,6.2,1.88,0

exk10g,Idk what to do anymore,"I’m 16, my brother is 18 and my sister is 29. My mom just got back from a major heart surgery(due to chronic alcohol abuse). My mother turned really toxic when she met her husband four years ago and it got worse when he left her. My mom and brother both blamed it on me, and my brother said “No one can be happy if you’re around, you’re the reason why everyone leaves” and my mom agreed. That was the last time I saw my brother for six months. I ended up moving across the US because my mom has a seizure and a stroke and was hospitalized, since I was sixteen they state wanted me in foster care but my aunt went through that and practically adopted me. She was the purest women ever and I’ll never be able to thank her enough for what she did for me. However, six months roll by and it was time for me to move back home. The first time I saw my mom she only made comments on my weight, and how I refused to let go of it. When she was bigger than me, until her diet was strictly alcohol and cigarettes. Things were going down hill, fast. My brother was getting out of hand, my mom always had something to say about my weight, blaming me for her upcoming heart surgery, no matter what I did, everything was somehow my fault. I only had two people on my side; my sister, and my boyfriend(and if it wasn’t for him, I don’t think I’d be holding on). My mom recently got back from a heart surgery, and she blamed me for someone totaling her car months ago, when I was across the US and didn’t even know what was going on. They blamed me for chores not being done even though I was going to work AND school. I won’t get home until after 10 and still have homework. Anyways, my brother laid his hands on me for the first time since I’ve been back, and my boyfriend knows about it and has struggled keeping his cool around him. The other night I got home, and everyone started screaming at me, all at once. I had my boyfriend on the phone(which no one had seen I was on a call during this). And that’s when my mom grabbed me(one of her previous boyfriends did that so now I have panic attacks if someone grabs me like that), she knew that, I pleaded for her to let go, I was having a panic attack, and I needed her to let go because I was freaking out(I was trying not to black out, my boyfriend is still on the phone listening to all of this). My brother starts screaming things along the lines of; let me hit her, I want to knock her the f*ck out, I’m going to hit her, I’m gonna knock you out. At the same time my mom is screaming at me saying I’m gonna be the reason she’s in a hospital dead from her stitches being ripped out. And my sister is screaming at me saying I’m selfish and I only care about myself. My mom still wouldn’t let go, and once I finally got out I fell into a ball and my panic attack got worse, I couldn’t breath or talk(my boyfriend is now at my house, pissed.) I couldn’t even speak to him, I was embarrassed, he knew things were bad, but he didn’t know they were that bad. I barely convinced him to leave because I was just so tired and I didn’t want him getting charged for trespassing. I sat in a ball continuing to have a panic attack, while my mom walks in saying she’s gonna call an ambulance because she thought I was on drugs. The next day I could hardly brush my hair cause my scalp was sensitive from my pulling it during a panic attack, and I could hardly talk cause I was grinding me teeth so hard. The day after they all ignored me other than my boyfriend. My sister wanted nothing to do with me. This morning I woke up, and was getting ready to do volunteer work(because I’m so selfish right???), and my sister is making condescending comments towards me, and as I got ready to leave, she finally said something. She rudely asked me where I was going, I explained what I was doing. She looked at me and her face dropped because now she knew she’d fucked up, realized I wasn’t selfish or whatever going through her head. I slammed the door and left. While waiting on my ride I got a text from her. “*my name*, I love you”, I didn’t bother responding because that’s toxic and manipulative.",whats_a_dad,2020-02-01 22:01:55,4,818,11.99,32.12,90.1,1.32,22.11,13.08,95.97,62.96,25.43,20.78,14.55,0.24,0.49,5.01,0.49,4.65,3.67,12.1,11.49,5.87,8.07,2.32,21.64,2.08,1.47,1.83,1.96,0.49,5.38,1.1,4.28,0.86,1.71,0,14.55,3.18,0.86,6.11,3.06,10.02,1.59,2.2,1.59,1.83,1.34,2.69,3.55,0.61,1.71,1.22,3.79,1.34,1.96,0.12,0.73,7.46,2.93,0.73,1.71,1.47,0.61,10.02,7.82,1.47,16.5,3.3,6.23,7.58,0.61,0.49,0.86,0,0,0.12,1.1,0.37,0.49,0.12,0,0.24,16.26,4.4,5.38,0,0.24,0.37,0,0,0.49,3.3,1.71,0.37

I had a relatively positive day at work (Rare) and i was riding my electric motor scooter on the way home since it has a motor im force to ride in the rode as a ""motorized vehicle"" and as such am given the same ""share the rode"" privilege as say someone on a bike
I often listen to music but im very careful and make sure to Repeatedly look behind me while im riding to stay safe I was about halfway home when i noticed a bright light appeoching from behind so natrually i turned around to make sure i wasnt in anyones way as i did a massive Tow Truck begain to speed up nearly 10 feet from me I was forced to Jump from my scooter at high speed to leap onto the sidewalk to keep from getting hit and the driver didnt bother to slow down or stop to make sure i was ok my good day ruined i called my grandmother to tell her what had happened. Yes while i screamed and said that no matter what i do to be happy the world wants me to suffer she proceeded to tell me the following

""Then live like a hermit thats the only way that life will stop effecting you""
""Just get over it and be greatful you were paying attention""
""Dont dwell on the Bad things to ruin your good day bad things happen to everyone""

1: Im tired of bad thingd preventing me from being happy

2: Had I not seen his lights i would have died without question

3: Bad things == HE TRIED TO KILL ME!!!! (Thats not exactly something you ""get over"")

Then when i tried to tell her these facts she proceeded to mock me in a self inflated tone

""oh my goodness call the cops did you get his licence number oh my goodness alert the presses poor ""Darkmage7766"" (not my real name) i hope shes not hurt""

I hung up on her and texted her told her to forget it that she didnt understand

She texted back and said ""Your the one that needs to forget it. You need to be grateful your alright, like I am and let it go""

exmgp7,Am I being over dramatic about the situation?,"So for a bit of background information, me and my boyfriend have only been together for a month now and it’s been going well. But yesterday he did something that’s really making me question who he is. So I’ve been given some new tablets for my adhd that are making me a little sleepy, my boyfriend is aware of this so when I accidentally fell asleep at his house yesterday he didn’t mind. I’m not sure how long I was asleep for but all I know is when I started to wake up my boyfriend had his hands down there (you know what I mean hopefully). Me and my boyfriend haven’t done anything too sexual yet so it really made me uncomfortable for him to do that in my sleep without my consent. I froze up and didn’t move as I didn’t know what was going on and as he assumed I was still asleep, he proceeded to try and push his fingers in. Not only was I feeling really uncomfortable but it hurt because of the force he was using. Now I’m scared to fall asleep in front of him or get drunk. Anything that could make me vulnerable around him basically. I pretended to wake up and I asked what he was doing and he pretended he was asleep and had just woken up when I did. Now I don’t know what to do, am I being over dramatic about this all? Should I just ignore it and hope it doesn’t happen again?

exnw71,y wife beat me and I used to it..What the hell is wrong with me?????,"First of all, I want to say sorry for bad English, it is not my primal.

Secondly - This is not made up, it is not a fetish and it is not a sexual fantasy. You can believe it or not, but I'm not lying, this is a true story.

I've been married for 10 years. My wife was always more dominant, she always liked that everything was how she wanted, when she got angry she bang on the door, yell at me, get in my face and smash around the house, but I always attributed it to her temperament and I accepted it as it is.

But for the last year .. when something is not how she wants and when she is angry, she starts hitting me, wery hard on my face, she face slapping me, sometimes 10 slaps in a row and she often grab me hard by the hair. SHe even knows to take a belt and it hits me everywhere with him.

When she slapped me for the first time, I was in a big shock .. I didn't know what to feel, what to think, what to say ... I thought it would never happen again. And so every time ... I didn't react and I couldn't tell anyone, who will believe me, what people would think of me.. I talked to her and she said that the she cant control her anger but that she that is wrong and she would never again beat me, but she never stopped .. and so time passed ...

I didn't want to leave, I have a wonderful 3 kids with her, and I love her so much, I always wanted family and I was not ready to leave her and my family.

And now the shocking part...over time, I got used to it. Moreover, I started to like it, too see her angry when she scolds me and when I now that now I will be beaten. I started looking at God in her.

I have to say that she never beat me for no reason, it is not that she beat me just like that, it is always when I do something that harms our marriage, when I disrespect her or when it is not something how she want and later it turns out that she is right.

I know it's not right, but I love to see her so strong, I love her power, her anger...I feel like I love her now more then I ever love her..I love everything about her. I used to bother becaose she being lazy, now I love it too. I love her and when she doesn't bathe in the 2nd week, I love her scents and smells, everything about her.

Otherwise she is a good woman, always ready to help, she is a good mother and besides this ""problem"" we have no other problems.

But..she beat me.

Although I liked it, I know it's not right. What the hell is wrong with me? Has anyone passed anything like this? Should I seek psychological help?",Kodi70,2020-02-02 04:42:19,9,528,2.9,29.78,51.41,20.07,17.6,8.14,95.27,66.1,30.11,20.45,11.36,0.38,0.19,8.52,0,9.66,3.6,8.9,8.52,7.2,9.66,4.55,18.18,3.22,1.33,3.79,0.95,1.14,8.33,3.98,4.36,0,2.27,0.19,15.72,1.33,0,9.09,0.19,17.23,2.46,2.08,2.65,1.89,3.41,5.3,2.84,0.57,0.95,0.95,2.65,0.57,0,0.38,0,9.28,3.6,1.89,3.03,1.14,1.33,4.73,12.31,0.76,13.26,0.95,3.6,8.71,0.19,0.76,0.95,0,0.57,0,0.38,0.38,0,0,0,0,20.08,9.09,7.2,0,0,1.52,0,0.19,0.38,1.7,0,0

ext3da,"Found out the extent of the abuse my gf has gone through before, and want some advice on how to best support her, especially when we disagree","Last week my girlfriend of over a year and I got into a really big argument that got really nasty. The fight lasted two day’s, and by the end of the argument my girlfriend told me I was yelling at her, which made me feel awful. We talked some more about the argument once we were both calm, and eventually she showed me a text message she had sent to her friend about the abuse her ex boyfriend out her through (a part of the fight was around her friend who is still friends with my gfs abusive ex despite knowing what he did). What I saw horrified me, and made me feel so bad for my girlfriend for having gone through what she did. I’ve been on the verge of tears the last couple of day’s anytime I think about exactly what it was this guy out my girlfriend through. On that whole list of things I saw, I have never exhibited any of that abusive behaviour (nor would I ever), but seeing that made me feel like she’s gone through enough, and I’ve been feeling so bad the last couple of days about every time I’ve accidentally hurt my girlfriends feelings. 

Part of this post is me honestly asking how to deal with conflict when you’re with someone who’s suffered like she has, because I’m worried that any argument (especially if it gets out of hand from either of us) will remind her of some of the stuff she was put through. To be clear, she went through abuse that went much further than simple arguments, but im genuinely afraid that any accidental argument or mistake I make might take her back, which worries me because I want to support her and make her know how much I care about her, but also don’t want to be a doormat if we don’t agree on something.",curbilo23,2020-02-02 10:54:35,6,344,38.6,67.9,51.47,1,38.22,15.7,96.8,60.17,22.67,15.99,8.72,1.45,0.29,5.52,0,6.69,4.94,16.28,8.72,6.69,6.98,1.16,20.35,3.78,2.33,3.78,0.58,4.94,9.59,2.03,7.56,0.87,4.36,0.87,16.28,0,3.49,5.81,0.87,15.7,2.91,2.91,2.03,3.78,2.03,3.49,3.78,1.45,0.29,2.03,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,7.56,4.94,0.29,0.87,1.45,0.58,8.14,9.59,0.87,13.66,2.33,5.23,6.1,0,0,0.29,0,0,0,1.45,0,0.58,0.29,0,0,11.34,2.33,4.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.2,1.74,0

exusd8,Vacation Tips Needed,"Hello Reddit,

For the past five and half years I've been really close with someone. We started off dating, got engaged, but then his mental illness spiraled out of control and we broke it off after he became verbally and physically abusive. He moved 500 miles away last June and we kept in contact, but haven't seen each other in person since.

Since he left, he has gotten on lithium and seems to be more stable. Long story short, we had a non refundable vacation planned for next week, and decided to give it a go. He's on his way here by train now, and he'll stay with me for a week before we fly out together for two weeks on vacation.

I felt pretty solid and excited about it, but now I'm suddenly having flashbacks to everything that has happened before. I really need some support and positive thinking from the community to lessen my anxiety about this. I saved for this trip for over a year by working three jobs, and really want it to work out. It's my dream vacation and thinking about it is what has kept me going for the past year through everything that has happened.

Please send me some support that it will all work out and that I can get through this and have fun, and some tips if you have any about how to set boundaries once he gets here so that we can enjoy this trip with minimal issues. 

Thanks in advance!",QThrowAway2016,2020-02-02 12:39:06,1,255,53.83,72.17,81.03,76.5,19.62,15.29,93.33,56.08,18.43,10.2,4.31,2.35,0.39,3.14,0,8.24,2.75,17.65,7.45,5.49,8.24,0.39,19.61,3.92,1.57,0.78,2.35,2.75,5.1,3.92,1.18,0.39,0.39,0.39,11.37,0,0.39,0,3.53,12.55,2.35,1.57,1.57,3.14,1.57,3.53,0.78,0.39,0,0.39,0.78,0,0.78,0,0,9.02,3.92,1.96,0.78,2.75,0,7.45,12.16,1.57,20.78,3.53,8.63,9.02,1.57,2.75,0,0.39,0,0,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,0,11.37,4.31,4.31,0,0,0,0.39,0,0,2.35,0,0
exv312,Abusive and manipulative parents...,"So I thought It was getting better with the emotional side of things with my mum. 
Well I was wrong. 
The physical abuse has got a lot worse again, daily is becoming more and more into hourly. 
But the emotional abuse which I thought had got a lot better hasn’t. She said it’s all my fault. My fault about everything. Being alive? Yep that’s my fault. Her getting raped (before I was born!) yep that’s my fault. Everything is my fault. And I hate myself for it! I know I’ll never be okay in her eyes! And that hurts. 
Her and my step dad take turns. She buys me tablets and makes suicide comments. telling me  “just do it already”  which hurts- yet I’ve numbed it.

exy6jp,I feel so hopeless,"I don't even know where to start. My mind is so completely overwhelmed. I've been with my husband just over 10 years, known him for 20. He always drank, but as he cut down over the years, his behavior worsened. We have 4 kids. 3 years ago he (blackout drunk) attacked me ""for turning off the tv"" at 3am on a school/work night. He grabbed me by my hair, threw me to the floor, kicked me in the head and repeatedly asked, ""how many times do I have to kick you in the f###ing face before I can leave you [name]?"" He choked me unconscious and dragged me outside where he left me in my ripped underwear. He went back in and locked me out. I woke up maybe an hour later and tried to get inside to collect my things. With the door locked, I was forced to dig through a bag of dirty laundry outside to find something to wear. I walked to work and cleaned myself up. He worked nights and I worked days with a 30 minute period to trade kids. Typically he would pick me up from work and take me home, but I started to walk. He rolled up on a bike accusing me of stealing his phone and car keys which I hadn't. I asked why he was there and he said ""I want my stuff."" I said, ""Well I don't have your stuff and you beat the shit out of me."" He didn't remember anything and brushed it off with a ""sorry, I don't remember."" I'm left to pick up the pieces and feel like his excuses are valid to him enough to pretend it never happened. Since this event, he has disappeared from home more than 4 times. 2 years ago he went to the store drunk and never came back. He turned off his phone and left me without a car or money for 3 days over New Years. By the end of the 3rd day, I was sure he must be dead somewhere. Nope, he just felt he deserved to ditch me and 4 kids for 3 days. When he came back, he promised he was a changed man. Said I was his priority. I let him come back under one condition. That he make an appointment with a psychiatrist. He agreed. A week later he was gone again over a weekend. Several months later, he lost his job and forced me to quit mine unless I could find childcare and pay for it myself. So now I have no income. His income goes into his bank account that I have no access to. He disappeared on Thanksgiving day. I had spent the whole day alone in the kitchen cooking and gave him one job: to clear the messy table so we could eat together. When dinner was ready, I said I was going to take a shower and we could eat as soon as he cleared the table. While in the shower, he served Thanksgiving dinner without me on the living room floor. I was devastated. He stormed out and drove drunk 3 hours away to his aunt's house. This is again leaving me without money, without a car and without car seats in case I could uber somewhere. I reached out to his family saying I needed help with him, that I was being abused when he drank (which was increasingly often). I asked them to help encourage him to stop. I was met with, ""He's a grown man. He can drink when he wants. That's how dudes blow off steam."" I was blamed for my ""behavior."" He came home the next day once again vowing he was going to change. My birthday came and went without acknowledgment. A month later, our anniversary. He has always been forgetful and claims he can't remember dates. Says if I want to celebrate anything, I should plan it myself. I tried to help by saying we should plan our anniversary. He raged in my face that he didn't want to celebrate it at all. He got raging drunk on our anniversary and I had to stand by with a hose because he kept dousing our fire pit with gasoline. Several days later, he got himself a therapist. I considered this a huge success. I figured things would start to improve. He stopped drinking entirely, but seems to be on this high horse like he doesn't need to do anything else. I get $100 a week allowance (if he remembers) that ends up being spent entirely on food for my kids. I wake up at 4am and do 100% of the regular house chores and child care. Get lunches packed, review homework, deal with school stuff like conferences. He goes to work (gets a break from kids and has other adults to talk to and gets paid for it) while I ""work"" non-stop for $100 a week and I get no breaks. I tried explaining that we both have jobs and that when his ends, we both are equally responsible for everything at home. He refuses to talk about it. He has even tried to use the whole ""my therapist agrees with me"" bs to make me feel like no one would believe I'm being abused. His therapist gave him homework of one hour per weeknight and I'm the boss. Basically I am supposed to be able to say, ""Please put these clean dishes away and take the trash out"" and he is supposed to do it. He had to look me in the face in therapy and promise to do anything I ask for one hour a night. He was reluctant on night one and took out the trash and then said watching tv with me counts. On night two he said he didn't remember what his homework was. On night 3 after I reminded him what his homework was, he said it was stupid and he wasn't going to do it. That was months ago now. I am overworked, overwhelmed, heartbroken for all I thought my life would be, hopeless for the future, jealous of his hobbies he pays attention to, starved for any kind of intimacy. My kids are growing up watching him ignore me and I feel like I'm dying right in front of them. His excuse is that it's because he has ADD and without saying it outright, he wants me to 100% adapt and conform to make his life run smooth regardless of what I sacrifice. At this point, I can't even smile. ADD doesn't make you refuse to celebrate your wife's birthday unless she plans it and buys her own gift.

exzuhs,What's to say to a friend giving you updates on the ex bf that was abusive?,"So my best friend (like a sister at this point) recently got broken up with and called me (I live 2 hours away) to tell me about all the shitty things that her ex had done to her. The most physical he got was some shoving, but he was also disgusting about sexual things and made her feel gross all the time. (She thought she was in love with him, so she thought it was okay). Of course the first phone call I listened and I was patient with her because that's all she really needed at the time. It has been a few days now and I'm kind of in a really sad headspace because she hid things so well.

I had actually met him when I visited my home town and I really didn't like him and actually felt guilty because I knew my opinion meant a lot to her. He made a ""joke"" about how she and I probably scissor all the time. Now I just feel really guilty for letting her spend over a year with a guy so terrible. I really appreciate that she is sharing and letting me help her, but I also don't want to overstep or say the wrong things.

I have some kind of idea because my dad is emotionally abusive, but I have never even had a boyfriend, so I don't know exactly how to relate. We cried a lot together on the phone and she's just been super upset with all these new things that she finds out. They work together (she got him the job a month ago) so he's been telling people ridiculous things and the piece of shit is actually talking to a girl they work with. Who is 17... we're all 21.

ey9em1,I [18F] want to move out but am worried about leaving my mom [59F] alone with my emotionally abusive dad [62M]? What should I do? Help!,"A little backstory...

I grew up with sisters that are way older than me. While they were off at college at far-away cities, it was just me, my mom, and my dad. My mom is basically the breadwinner of the family. She pays for all the groceries and pays all the bills. Legit all the bills. My dad doesn't pay for anything. I'm not sure if that detail was relevant but yeah. My parents have been together for 30+ years.

At first, I didn't realize how unnormal the things my dad did were. How could I when I was so young? But, as I reflect back on it I realize how controlling he was. When my dad was away at work and would call and my mom was on the phone with someone else, he'd make me put the phone near my mom so he could hear the conversations she was having. He also gets angry easily. Getting mad at little things out of his control, yelling a lot, and holding grudges against people for longer than he should.

But the worst thing was (and still is) his incessant belief that my mom is cheating on him. My mom found texts on my dad's phone to his ex-girlfriend telling her he loved her and when my dad was confronted about it, he completely manipulated the situation and said, ""Well, you're cheating too! How do I know you aren't texting your ex-boyfriends too?"" I know my mom and I know she has not and would never do that. In fact, my dad was my mom's first and only boyfriend.

Fast forward a couple years, my cousin and her husband started living with us. And my dad was CONVINCED that my mom was cheating on him with my cousin's husband. My mom kept denying and denying to the point where she was physically shaken and uncontrollably cried because my dad kept calling her a slut and refused to believe her. It got so bad that my mom came to me crying, telling me she wanted to kill herself. That was my sophomore year of high school.

My dad would keep bringing up the idea of her cheating periodically, to which she cried hysterically every time. I remember one argument got so bad, my mom grabbed a knife and said she wanted to kill herself.

When my dad was on a trip out of the country, he heard laughing behind him and thought people (who didn't even know my mom, let alone my cousin or her husband) were laughing at him since ""his wife cheated on him with his niece's husband"". He got so angry he called my mom to accuse her of cheating. Again.

My sisters, aunts, and uncles, and I sat my dad down to have a sort of intervention to tell him how we feel. This resulted in a lot of crying and breakdowns by my sisters and I defending my mom. He kinda got the message and said he would get therapy. But he hasn't. While the accusations of cheating has stopped, my dad still gets mad a lot. My entire family tries to tip toe around things in an attempt to not make him angry.

Fast forward to today, I am currently a freshman in college. I go to a college in my town and live at home because my mom practically begged me to stay and I happily obliged cause A) cost of living is expensive and B) I know my mom needs me.

However, lately I have felt like being on my own. My sisters live in town and have invited me to come move into their house just to kinda ""live on my own without living on my own"", essentially just away from my parents. And my mom seemingly seemed excited for me. Getting hyped with me when talking about decorating my new room, etc. But I had a conversation with my sister and she said my mom said about me, ""I know that she wants to move away cause of dad. I understand. But, that means I am going to be alone with your dad."" and broke down crying.

I'm sure you might be thinking, why doesn't my mom divorce him? (or maybe you aren't). And to be honest, I've suggested it before. My mom says that for the children's sake, it is better to have two parents than separated parents. To have a loveless marriage instead of no marriage. My mom cares so much about people that she sacrifices her own happiness. Heck, she even told me, ""what is your dad gonna do without me? he has no money. he'll starve out there"". She cares so much about someone who is unable to love her.

Is it selfish of me to want to move out, let alone move out? Should I stay with my mom? Should I get them help? I feel so helpless about this entire situation.

**TL;DR - I really wanna move out but I cannot help but feel selfish for wanting to leave my mom alone with my dad.**",SorryPlantain,2020-02-03 08:15:30,3,876,26.65,65.12,61.27,1.71,13.69,14.61,96.23,59.25,22.37,18.72,11.53,0.23,0.8,5.82,0.34,3.65,3.65,13.7,9.02,6.05,7.76,1.83,20.09,2.97,1.14,1.94,0.57,1.37,6.62,1.83,4.79,0.34,2.17,1.37,20.09,7.76,0.34,6.51,5.94,13.13,2.85,1.94,2.17,1.94,1.26,3.65,2.17,0,1.6,0.57,1.71,0.11,1.03,0.11,0.23,9.13,4,1.48,2.17,1.37,0.57,5.94,9.82,0.68,12.67,2.74,7.08,3.88,1.14,0.34,0.57,0.91,0.23,0.23,1.03,0.23,0.46,0.11,0.11,0,17.35,6.28,3.88,0,0.11,1.03,0.23,0.46,1.14,2.05,0.91,1.26

eydqy8,Disneyland is not the happiest place on Earth,"My bipolar mother severely abused me mentally,  emotionally and physically until she died when I was 21.  She would call me Piggy and make pig sounds when she was really angry about the way I looked.   Then sometimes she would tell me throughout life that I was beautiful,  I had lips, cheeks and eyebrows women paid a lot if money for.

Being her daughter was exhausting and by her death I just had gone numb.  

There are too many instances and examples to give, but one of many stands out to show the personality i lived with

My mom, dad, brother and me took a big roadtrip  from Texas to the West coast when I was 9.  My brother was a teenager so he was going to hang out with my dad and I was going to Disney with my mom.

I could see it in her eyes that she didn't want to be there.  Once I saw the familiar look the helium in my balloon began to go out.

About 2 hours into our day she just looks at me and says - You dont really need me here, do you?

I know she doesn't want to be there, but I am shocked, but this isn't my first rodeo with her.

She tells me the bus I need to take back to the hotel, hands me a $10 or $20 and leaves. 

I remember standing in lines for rides and some people asking me where my parents were.  They were all shocked when I said they were back at the hotel.  I remember feeling incredibly lonely,  thrown away and numb to my surroundings in this spectacular place.

My dad is fuming when I get home because he is so worried and this was many years before cell phones would be in everyone's hands. 

My dad had no idea the extent of my mothers abuse because he was gone for most part of the day.

Flash forward 13 years.  I move from Texas to San Diego, CA.  A lot of locals love Disney.   The first time back I'm dreading it, but none of my know.  I hated it and I hated being there and I felt shock too.

I looked at some of the kids who were my age at the time and they just looked like...babies.  i couldn't imagine leaving a single one of them on my own.

It's been 30 years past now and i have come to love and appreciate Disneyland, but there is always that sting for the first few minutes until i can let the positive environment sink in.

Dear Parents, 

Please dont leave your kids at Disneyland.   It will fuck with their head for the rest of their life.",HapaHawaii,2020-02-03 12:53:46,1,463,33.84,41.46,80.38,7.99,17.15,10.58,90.93,58.1,19.01,16.2,10.8,0.22,0.65,3.24,1.3,2.81,4.97,12.74,9.94,5.83,7.78,1.94,19.87,2.38,0.86,1.51,3.02,2.81,4.97,1.73,3.24,0.43,1.51,0.22,12.53,3.02,0.22,3.89,1.94,9.29,1.94,0.65,2.16,1.73,0.86,2.59,4.1,2.38,0.86,0.86,3.46,1.51,1.3,0.22,0,4.1,1.73,0.65,0.65,0.86,0.22,8.21,8.86,0.86,16.2,3.02,7.13,7.13,0,0.43,0.22,0.43,0,0.43,0.22,0.22,0,0,0,0,11.66,6.05,3.24,0,0,0.22,0,0.22,0,1.51,0,0.43

eyh980,I think I was abused/manipulated (TW suicide),"I don’t know. Maybe I’m just being overdramatic. But here goes anyway...  
I was in a relationship with this woman, starting when I was 18 and she was 20. Everything was perfect at first. Amazing. Healthiest relationship I’d been in. We moved in together after a few months, we were in university. I was an active member of my church. She came with me one day. Went with me to the church’s brunch after. I stepped away to talk to my priest, and a church member apparently started talking about abortion, which upset my (pro choice) girlfriend. After that, she wasn’t as supportive of me going to church. Getting me to stay up late so I wouldn’t wake up on time. She made me feel embarrassed about being Catholic. Okay, whatever. I slowly removed myself from my church.  
Then, there was the sex. She was always great about enthusiastic consent! Until I had a hysterectomy... And couldn’t have sex because I was healing... Then, she guilted me into having sex. One time she didn’t stop until I was screaming. I ended up in the ER. Then I came out as asexual. She started crying because it made her dysphoric (she’s trans) that I wasn’t sexually attracted to her. That sex was a big part of our relationships. If I said no, she pressured me until I said yes. Eventually I started saying yes to get it over with. I didn’t want to, but knew she wanted to. I wanted to make her happy. Idk.  
There was also the suicidal thinking. I’m deeply suicidal, have been since I was 10, maybe earlier. She progressively became more and more suicidal. But it felt like a lot of times it was when we argued. One time, I had to go to the mental hospital for a checkup. Idk what happened specifically that upset her, I think it was because I didn’t want her in when I was talking to the doctor, and refused to go inpatient, but we fought, and she attempted suicide in front of me. I was scared to ever argue with her again.  
We broke up a few months ago. She fell in love with somebody else. But any time she texts me or posts, my fight or flight kicks in. Ever since she’s left, I felt dirty and disgusting. I can’t shower. I feel like my body is tainted and I don’t know why. Today, she threatened suicide again (I think bc we had another big fight) and I spent hours trying to find somebody who would check up on her. Her gf sent me a message but the feel of the message was kind of a “Screw off” kind of feeling.  

Idk. Maybe I’m being overdramatic. I don’t feel like it was abuse, but also I’ve been abused in the past, and don’t want to admit it can happen yet again. I’m just so drained. I’m so tired. I feel like PTSD symptoms are setting in. I’m scared to talk to my therapist about it. He’s always supportive, but I’m so ashamed admitting all this. I feel disgusting.

eyhli6,About my Ex and my thoughts - trigger warning,"I have spent long periods of time trying to figure out everything that has happened with the ex. We are no longer together, but it still runs through my mind as I want to understand why or how someone can even be that way.

He was unempathetic, rude, and completely controlling. But he always lied to everyone. He attacked me one time that i remember like it was yesterday, it was frightening. He punched me in the face 4-7 times and had hold of my sweater breaking my glasses and busting up my face. He told EVERYONE he only slapped me once and I cried wolf. This man was horrifically violent and dangerous. He had gotten so angry once he threw a disc across the room and almost hit his sleeping son (5 months old) over an angry outburst that I didn't ""do as he pleased"" and keep my mouth shut over him lying to me again and cheating AGAIN. (which he did frequently). In his mind I was his house mom, i was to clean up after him, feed him, care for him and his children, and that was all i was good for. He wasn't even interested.

Ontop of that, he ignored me and his children so he could play video games online with women he knew in person, whom he'd talk about me to (and lie incessantly) and then further lie to my face and gaslight me when I'd catch him doing it as i heard them laughing from the laundry room at a stupid comment ""she's on pills tell her to just take them all and die."" (Im on anxiety medication because of him, he calls them my crazy pills regularly and tells me to shut up and take them, even as hes my ex now) I had an assessment done, which i was clear and only had anxiety and said that to him, i said to him ""why didn't you get one done??  I bet your way worse off than I am, so stop insulting me and look in the mirror. Your the crazy person, you've been on probation 3 times for violent behavior now, and not just from me. You flip your lid at the drop of a hat. That's reserved for crazy people. So take your stupid insults and stuff them"" (this is after 8 years of him saying im a psycho and crazy to my face and behind my back.)

He acted like a jerk any time I showed any type of emotion I was a loser and a bitch. ""Shut up and put up""  was what he believes everyone should do. And god forbid if you ever pointed out his bad behavior, thats around when he'd violently lash out. If he didn't decide to become emotionally abusive by calling you horrific names and telling you to go cry to someone who cares.

eynedb,I don't know what to do anymore.,"Hi. I'm here because the mods at r/relationships suggested my story is more suited for this sub. [Here's the post I made.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ej07hf/am_i_being_toxic_and_demanding_for_wanting_to/)

I broke up with my boyfriend earlier in January and the days have been a blur. I've told him over and over not to come over and talk but he keeps doing so. When I block him on social medias he just comes over our house and begs for me to let him in and unblock him. My parents, especially my mother, is pissed off by this; they don't want him causing drama at our house. The only solution I've thought of to fix that is to just unblock him and let him talk to me on social media so he doesn't come over. 

But he still hangs out at my place like nothing's wrong and interacts with my siblings like I want him there. I've tried talking to him and begging him to just let me be and I know shouting and hitting him wasn't a good thing but I've done that too.

He continues to take up space in my home and hovers over me and pushes on my physical space. I don't want him touching me. There was a time after we broke up where he just insisted I kiss him and he just went ahead and kissed me and I didnt move and I just cried until he broke away.

eyqhaq,Life tends to lead me towards destruction followed by a state of reconstruction,"Last night I found myself to be in a space filled with people who weaponize hate and lashing out rather than taking a step back to empathize with those who were in the center of the mess. At some point or another, criticism turns into hate, and so rapidly.  
The perfect storm is coming  
I'm sick, soon to be out of a job, once again separated from the person I care for most, and in turn depressed.  
I'm so sick of this accept for defeat i put myself through time and time again.  
I'm a perfectionist, even when pertaining to the standards I hold myself to; and quite possibly others.  
It's so far from logical to utterly destroy everything you've built up, rather than working to correct a flaw in your character, or rather coming to accept the opinions you hold about those, more so groups of individuals, you don't feel hold themselves to the same standards. Mainly because you know so little can be done to help. To stop those you value from radicalizing through ways of dealing with issues unlike your own.  
They won't admit it, but it's motivated through the excitement of stepping on someone who is quite typically above them. Trying to pin a particular perpetrator when in reality, it's the small mistake of 10 or even 100 individuals combined, all typically varying degrees of forgivable error.  
It makes me personally very scared of public scrutiny. I am, in turn driven to become an infallible human.  
That in itself is a flaw, but the cycle has continued to fight itself without much regard whatsoever.  
Removal, deconstruction, and then a place where I'm free to place myself in a state of believable lies.  
Next comes an attempt to test this uncontested consciousness I have formed for myself.  
It's always doomed to fail, yet why do I feel it necessary to put myself through such torture?  
Past abuse perhaps?  
If that's the case, it's incredible how childhood shapes us. Breaking free from these chains may very well be a failing struggle.  
The failing becomes easier and easier, but I still yearn to be freed all together.",threegreyyears,2020-02-04 06:03:18,0,371,69.66,46.77,91.17,2.33,17.67,19.68,88.14,57.14,15.09,8.36,5.39,0.27,1.89,0,0.81,6.74,6.74,18.06,8.36,7.82,6.47,0.81,14.56,5.12,2.16,2.16,0.81,2.16,9.7,3.5,6.2,0.54,2.7,1.62,7.55,0,0,0,0,15.36,3.77,1.62,1.62,4.31,2.16,4.31,0.54,0,0,0.54,0.81,0,0.81,0,0,7.01,1.35,2.43,3.5,0.81,1.35,1.62,10.78,1.62,17.25,3.77,8.09,5.66,2.43,0,0,0.54,0.27,0,0.27,0,0,0,0.27,0,14.56,4.85,5.39,0,0.27,0.54,0,0,0,3.5,0,0

eyxr7k,"""I was so scared for you. I should have spoken up."" Why didn't you?","So  lately, I've had so many people tell me ""WHen you guys started dating I  was so scared for you.  I really wish I would have said something.""  I  know these people mean well.  But to hear this over and over is  devastating.  Every time someone says this to me I just want to go  somewhere and cry.  All I can think is ""Why the hell didn't you?""  In  this beginning, all I got were glowing reports about him from everyone.   I was told I'm so lucky.  We are so perfect for each other,  they are  so glad he found someone.  Now here some of those same people are  telling me, ""I was so scared for you.  I really should have spoken up.""

Today  the tipping point was when someone said that to me and then she told me  that when she first befriended him, a bunch of acquaintances warned her  about him so she kept her distance and dodged a bullet.  I'm angry.   This is the kind of anger that cuts deeper than anything else.  I'm  angry at the universe for letting this happen to me.  I'm angry that I  have to exist on the same planet as this fucker.  I know this probably  sounds dramatic, but this is actually how I feel today.  It's like, why  did some people get warned and I didn't, you know?  Why didn't anyone  speak up?  I had someone else tell me recently about the time he  basically tried to rape her.  Yet she was one of the people cheering us  on and telling me how lucky I was in the beginning.  What the fuck is  wrong with you people...?

Maybe  this is hitting me really hard because something similar happened when  the person who sexually abused me got prosecuted.  I told members of my  family that he was abusing me.  ANd of course, I was a liar, etc.  Then  20 years later my sister tells everyone he abused her.  And then  suddenly my whole family is furious and wants to nail his balls to the  wall.  And everyone is telling me, ""You know we always believed you  right?""  ""We always knew there was something off about him.""  I know  this isn't the same situation, but the way I feel is similar.  t's an  odd mix of sadness, anger and betrayal.

I  know I'm an adult and it's nobodies responsibility to protect me.  But  it's so upsetting knowing that so many people i know know he is bad  news... and stood by saying nothing.  I just can't stop crying.

Back  when we first started dating he brought his ex-girlfriend over to me at  an event to introduce me to her.  At the time it just seemed trivial.   He told me later on down the line that he was doing that to rub it in  her face that he found someone better.  I've already decided if he  brings some chick over to me and introduces me, I will look her dead in  the eyes right in front of him and tell her what he really is.  I wish  someone would have told me.  I will be the someone who tells... if I get  the opportunity.  He wants to play his little games, I'll play right  back.

Right now, none of my go-to  things to help are helping.  ANd I'm not even upset because I miss him  or anything like that.  I couldn't give a shit about him.  I'm upset  because someone could have helped me and didn't.",MyAllegoricalElegy,2020-02-04 13:48:14,7,597,5.74,62.49,59.52,1,11.94,12.4,96.15,64.82,27.97,19.26,10.89,0.84,1.68,5.7,0.17,8.54,4.19,10.55,11.06,8.54,8.21,2.01,22.45,4.86,2.35,2.51,0.67,2.01,6.87,1.68,5.19,1.01,2.51,0.84,18.26,0.5,0.5,2.35,3.85,16.25,3.18,1.51,2.35,4.52,1.68,4.02,2.68,0.5,1.51,0.67,1.01,0.5,0,0.5,0,6.53,2.18,0.84,1.51,1.51,1.01,7.71,12.73,1.68,12.4,0.67,5.86,6.2,0.5,1.01,0.34,0,0.17,0.17,0.84,0.67,0,0,0.17,0,18.26,8.54,2.68,0,0,1.01,0,0.34,2.01,3.69,0,0
ez0jfs,Escape,"I believe my dad is emotionally abusive. Manipulation, degradation, and intimidation are his strongest weapons. I escaped. At 20, I finally realized I was in an abusive situation and moved out, but I left my 16 year old sister and 14 year old sister to take the abuse that I was escaping. 
My 16 year old sister (we’ll call her L) told me she does not feel safe at home. My parents have threatened to take her out of school for holding hands with her crush. They have threatened to homeschool her for liking girls. They’ve told her there’s no such thing as being non-binary, something she explored about herself only to be ridiculed, yelled at, humiliated, and manipulated. 
Dad is a pastor. He holds religion and spirituality higher than anything else. When one of us would stop confirming to his wills and desires, he would use the Bible and religion to tell us we were screwing up and we’re going to spend eternity in hell if we didn’t get our act straight. 
L does not feel safe. She does not feel loved. She’s scared. She’s conflicted. She’s battling herself all the time. I want to get her out of there. I don’t know how. I need help.

ez492v,is this abuse?,"hi, lately i’ve been really in a dark place, i’ve never so actively looked for ways to kill myself until this year. i’ve been reflecting on a lot of my life and i’m wondering if the things my dads done to me is abuse or just him being an asshole.

when i was in miami for thanksgiving break, i was upset because i was going through a lot i had mono, a uti, and i was incredibly depressed. my dad came into the hotel room drunk and started yelling at me telling me i was ungrateful. i told him i wanted to go home and he yanked the sheets of my bed and started screaming at me about how i ruin everything. he was telling me to stop crying and grabbed my throat, he was his hitting my legs and was making fun of my for crying. i don’t think i’ve ever been that scared. my mom was sitting next to me in the bed and just didn’t do anything, i was terrified he’d hit her too. eventually i broke down and told him about my depression which he (while still being a dick) ended up being somewhat compassionate for. he was nice to me for the rest of the trip but every time i think about it i feel so helpless.

also he’s always had issues with is anger, i’ve never seen him angry and drunk until miami. when i ignored my uncle at out super bowl party he grabbed my arms really hard and was calling me an ass for “acting like he’s a rapist” which i’ve never really talked to anyone about but i don’t like how he likes to talk to me, i can’t tell if it’s just because he’s weird but maybe if it’s what my paranoid brain thinks then i’m an easy target. 

the reason i bring this up at all is my mom is at her wits end with me, she’s telling my dad about all my issues with depression, cutting, anxiety, and drug abuse. i’m really scared, i don’t know how he’s going to respond but i don’t want him to hit me again. whenever he is near me drinking i feel like i need to leave, he’s so unpredictable. i really do love my dad and he’s done a great job providing for us as a family but i don’t know if i’m always safe around him. 

i’m sorry most of this is rambling, but does this qualify as abuse? and if it does, what do i do?",missanniebananie,2020-02-04 21:11:19,6,430,5.39,14.76,81.05,1,22.63,10.23,95.35,65.81,25.35,21.16,15.12,0.23,0,5.81,0,4.19,4.19,12.79,14.42,8.14,10.23,2.33,23.95,4.19,1.16,2.33,0,1.63,9.53,2.79,6.74,1.4,2.33,2.09,11.86,1.86,0,1.16,6.28,12.79,2.33,1.63,1.86,3.26,2.33,4.42,2.33,0.7,0.47,1.16,3.49,1.63,0.7,0.47,0.7,3.26,1.4,0.23,0.93,0.23,0.47,7.44,12.56,0.93,12.09,1.63,4.42,5.81,0.23,1.63,1.16,0,0,0.23,0.7,0.7,0,0,0,0,16.05,3.72,3.95,0,0,0.7,0,0,0.47,6.74,0.47,0
ez4uaw,Never let anyone dull your flame,"I met him at a college party when I was 17 and he was 36. He had a wife and 3 kids, but I was so enamored with him I didn't care. He said they were going to get divorced. 

Once I turned 18, he asked me to be his girlfriend and i said yes. A day later he broke up with me and explained that he needed to tell me some things before I decided to date him. He explained that he was on the sex offender registry at a level 3 for having sex with a 14 year old when he was 22. He told me she lied and said she was 18 and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Eventually, he became extremely jealous and controlling. I couldn't hang out with a friend who was female. 

After I graduated, we would be off and on again, because of his controlling nature and jealousy. I didnt feel loved or beautiful so when he and I would break up, I would talk to other guys who made me feel pretty. 

Still at age 18, I broke up with him because he was acting crazy and he drove 6 hrs and his behind the trees and waited for me to get off of work. And he ran up on me and took my phone, searching through my messages for evidence of cheating. Which he didnt find any. He begged and begged for me to come back to him. And I gave in and gave him another chance. 

At 19, I moved 4 hrs away and lived with him and his brother. That was where he really put his hands on me. He dragged me into another room by my hair and threw me into the wall. It got worse from there, he would accuse me of sleeping with his brother, and flirting and I had to eventually lie and say yes so he would stop yelling at me. 

His brother demanded that money was no longer accepted and that if i wanted to live there, I would have to have sex with him. I was kicked out that night and walked to a gas station with one bag in the middle of winter. I went inside to warm my body and get a drink. I sat outside on the bench and sobbed. 

A man in a military uniform came to to me and asked me if I was okay. I told him yes, but he sat down and told me to tell him what happened. I explained that I didn't have access to my money, and my mom lived 4 hours away. The man offered to pay for a hotel room for me to stay in. 
I told him that my mother was going to get me a room soon. The man waited with me and walked with me over to the hotel. He told me his name and gave me his number and said to text him if I needed anything. 

He found my room and he told me the only way he would take me back is if I let him slap me in the face. 

From there on, the abuse only got worse. 

This man, that I believed in my heart to be my soulmate, would hurt me so bad, I welcomed death. And truly believed that my only escape was to die. 

We had broken up, and I had began dating a new guy, and one night, he asked me over, and I did, stupidly. He asked me to marry him. But I told him no because I was dating this guy. And so he slammed me into the ground multiple times and choked me and threw my head into the car multiple times before throwing me into the car and smashed my head into the window and into the gear stick. He told me that if he couldn't have me, then no one would. So I begged him to stop and that I would marry him.... and he just kept slamming my face into the window. He finally stopped and I swore i would never leave him again. And so the next day i asked my boyfriend to come see me so I could talk to him. So when he got my job and i started to explain that i couldn't be with him because of (abuser).

He has stomped all over my body. He has ripped out chunks of my hair to where my scalp is bleeding, he has punched me in the face, stomach. He has kicked me with boots on. He has slammed me into walls, floors, nails. He has choked me to where I couldn't speak, to where I was about to pass out. He has hit me with belts, hands. 

It started when I was 18, and ended almost 3 weeks ago. He may have beaten my body, but, the spark inside me refused to die.",autumndawn1996,2020-02-04 22:01:15,15,834,24.58,57.15,51.49,14.23,15.44,8.87,93.76,64.51,25.3,22.06,12.71,0.24,0.12,8.87,0.12,3.24,4.2,14.27,7.79,4.92,9.47,1.56,19.66,2.04,0.96,1.56,2.28,0.84,3.96,1.56,2.4,0.12,1.2,0.6,17.63,1.08,0.96,0.72,9.95,8.39,1.68,0.84,2.88,1.8,0.6,1.92,2.04,0.36,0.96,0.72,3,1.8,0.72,0.36,0.12,7.19,2.4,0.36,2.28,1.32,0.96,11.87,5.64,0.84,16.67,2.64,8.15,6.12,0.6,0.48,0.72,0.36,0,0.36,0.48,0,0,0.48,0,0,11.63,6.71,3.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.72,0.24,0

ez8zip,I'm really scared,"Hey Guys.

My fiance and I split up after 5 years and while I have been trying so hard to sort everything he has just become so controlling and manipulative and I'm really scared.

We moved out of state in November and ever since he has been treating me worse and worse. Not physically but emotionally and financially.

Today I found he had taken my engagement things from my room ( where he put all my things on the weekend) and was going to sell it.

I told him it was mine and he got really mad. I posted back to my parents in a different state so he couldn't get it and now he's super mad.

Each time I do something to ""defy"" him he strikes out and does something that he knows will hurt me. 

He comes off as such a nice guy to everyone so I'm going to come off as the gold digger crazy ex while he will be fine.

Based on our previous conversations I was meant to be leaving in 2 weeks and leave our dog with him while I go away for a week for a destination wedding but now I just feel like he will take my dog away so I can't take her with me when I leave.

I have booked the movers to come on Friday and I have booked flights for Friday night but I'm so terrified he's going to find out and hurt me more.

ezo83u,I need help with getting money and not having my abusive parents find out.,"My parents are a whole load of abusive I don’t want to get into or else I’ll spiral ( Mental, Emotional, Neglectful)

I’m turning 17 In July, I’m on the final stretch before I can break free of my family. I’m planning on spending my final summer as a child with my grandmother, along with this specific summer as well, to have as little contact with them as possible. I’m getting to a point in my life where I need to start saving up money for myself so I can get on my feet after I legally become an adult.

My problem is that I do NOT trust my parents with the possibility of them having or receiving my money. I get the feeling my parents are trying to make me dependent on them, and I will not allow that to happen. I plan on getting a job in the real world soon, but I have been told by multiple people they would pay money for stuff I do on the side, which is mainly art. 

I want to take this opportunity but I know the majority of online payment sites (PayPal, Patreon, Ko-Fi, etc) require me to be an adult. I also am absolutely terrified of the possibility of my family finding out. They always disproportionally overreact when it comes to me disobeying them or keeping something secretive, and I have the feeling they’d take at least some of my money if I told them.

TL;DR: I need advice on what to do to so I can gain money for myself without the knowledge of my abusive parents who are most likely trying to make me dependent or in some form “obligated” to give money / do things for them as an adult. I am 16 and on the way to becoming An adult so any advice would be greatly appreciated.",HopelessHiraeth,2020-02-05 22:29:48,1,326,58.91,19.53,93.43,16.93,27.17,15.64,94.48,58.9,19.94,16.56,13.8,0,0,0,2.76,3.37,5.52,17.79,10.43,2.76,6.44,1.53,18.1,5.21,2.76,1.53,0.61,2.45,3.68,1.53,2.15,0.31,0.92,0.31,10.43,2.45,0.31,0.31,0,14.72,3.07,0.92,2.76,5.21,0.92,3.68,0.61,0,0,0.61,0.92,0.31,0.61,0,0,9.2,2.45,1.84,2.15,3.07,0.61,0.92,13.5,1.53,12.27,0.92,7.67,3.68,1.84,0.92,0.61,3.99,0,0,0.61,0,0,0.31,0.31,0,12.58,3.68,3.68,0.31,0.31,0,0,0.31,0.61,2.15,1.23,0.31

ezv2qf,Repressed memories from 8 years ago just came flooding back.,"I was groomed online when I was 11. 

I never knew his name, saw his face, or any info about him. I met him on a kids online game, and he promised me gifts and coins within said gift (obviously parents would never let me spend money on these things)

He would ask me to masturbate on camera, and as I was 11 I hadn’t hit puberty so I didn’t actually feel good down there. I used a jug of water (out of the camera) to pretend it was me as that’s what he said real women did. 

From what I remember he was around 30-35. 

He would threaten me by saying he’s going to tell my parents and I will he put in a prison for children. 

He said I was disgusting and immoral. 

I don’t know why but I feel at fault. I could’ve just closed my laptop but I sent him those disgusting things and now I really do feel shamed.

I repressed these memories for years, until around 5 months ago when I was like “did that really happen??” 

Now I keep remembering little bits of info which make me realise it did happen. 

It explains why I’ve always hated my body, scared to be intimate with anyone and hate my downstairs area.. 

Sorry..I gues I needed a rant.

ezwkhq,Was this abuse?,"I don't know how to deal with this situation. It was something that I guess I placed under a rug and tried to never look back. It all came back strongly when I went for the ten day Vipassana meditation retreat four years ago and recently I revised that experience when I talking about the retreat to someone. I'm at an age that I'm questioning myself more and more because my longest relationship lasted about a year and a half and I have a hard time trusting anyone (but maybe it is my personality regardless).

When I was about 9-10 I guess, my brother who at the time was 13-14 years old would force me to do blowjobs (he was way stronger than me and would threaten to punch/hurt me). He also used me to learn about the female anatomy and once he tested how many q-tips he was able to insert in my vagina. This lasted for a few months, because then I guess my parents noticed and they separated us (we used to share the room and then each one of us would have a room). They never asked, I never told them anything. Was this abuse? I've never spoken to anyone about this.",anonymousYTO,2020-02-06 10:29:39,1,213,13.88,40.73,88.38,25.77,19.36,13.62,92.96,60.09,23.94,15.96,11.27,1.41,0,1.88,1.41,7.98,5.63,10.8,8.45,8.45,9.39,2.35,17.37,4.69,2.82,2.82,4.23,2.82,3.76,1.88,1.88,0.47,1.41,0.47,11.27,0.94,0,0.47,2.35,15.02,1.88,3.29,1.88,4.69,2.35,1.41,2.35,0.47,0.47,0.94,0.94,0.47,0,0.94,0,7.51,3.29,0.94,2.82,0,0.94,8.92,7.04,0.94,17.37,0.94,5.63,11.74,1.41,0.47,1.41,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.15,4.23,1.41,0,0,0.94,0,1.41,0,1.88,2.82,0.47
ezx9h2,It took a lot to write this,"I got into a relationship almost two months ago (yes, only two months) and there are a few things that she has done and said that have been bothering me. I’m a 24F dating a 21F 

Early in the relationship, she blatantly told me about a rape fantasy she has about me. A few days later, she grabbed me through my pants and refused to let go. I had to physically push her hand away. I’m already a survivor of sexual assault so things like that make me nervous, which she already knew before doing/saying any of these things. 

Last week, she choked me without warning or consent while we were out in public and in front of my friends. It was such an uncomfortable moment and I was so embarrassed that there was a long moment of awkward silence after I pushed her hand away. 


A few days ago, she called me a “fucking whore.” I’m not sure of the context because nobody was saying anything at the time. I’ve since been thinking about all of this and wondering: is this healthy? I’m not getting straight answers from friends. I would appreciate your help in this ❤️

Ps: she also refuses to take responsibility for any of this. She says “it wasn’t her” and that she would “never do that” and I’m not sure I know what that means.",darkblue317,2020-02-06 11:13:50,3,237,23.16,46.62,64.36,4.44,16.93,15.19,97.47,63.29,24.89,15.19,8.86,0.42,0.42,5.49,0,9.7,6.33,13.08,10.97,5.91,5.91,2.95,19.83,4.64,1.69,0.84,0.84,2.95,6.33,2.11,4.22,1.69,1.69,0,13.5,0,0.84,5.49,0,11.81,2.95,1.27,0.84,2.95,2.11,2.53,3.38,0,2.11,1.27,3.38,0.84,0.84,1.69,0,6.75,2.95,0.42,1.69,1.69,0.42,8.44,8.02,0,15.19,1.27,5.06,8.86,0.84,0.42,0,0,0,0,1.27,0.84,0,0.42,0,0,15.61,5.06,2.53,0.84,0,0.42,0,0,2.53,2.95,0.84,0.42
f021er,Was this abuse or am I just overreacting to sibling rivalry?,"Sorry it’s a long read.

Out of two girls, I’m the younger sister by 3 years. My older sister was never really kind to me growing up. (I’m 19 now). She’s never been a very affectionate person, and she has a far more aggressive personality, more serious than me. I’ve always been fairly optimistic and non confrontational, and really bubbly and excitable.
As a kid, my sister would always cut down my self-esteem. Every time I wanted to show her a drawing I made or a story I wrote, she would always reject seeing it because “Your stories are stupid.” Or “Your friends only say that you can draw well just to pity you and not hurt your feelings.” However, when she would ask me to listen to her play her flute or hear her sing to see if it sounded good, I agreed and gave her the time. I never got it back though.
Any time we got into an argument and she said something mean to me, I always ran to our mom crying that she had been mean. Of course my sister would begin to mock me and say that I’m a cry baby for running to mom every time she said something to me.
It wasn’t so bad when we were younger, but by the time we were both teens things started to get violent.
Suddenly I became afraid to be around my sister because if I did anything remotely wrong, or anything she found even slightly annoying, she would shove me, pull my hair, or kick me. And it only got worse from there.
We had two friends over one time who were both sisters, one my age and one my sister’s age. The friends wanted to hang out in my sister’s room, but when I tried to follow them and my sister in, she waited for the friends to turn the corner before digging her nails into my arm, causing them to bleed, saying “You’re not allowed in my room. Get out.” really quietly.
The worst incidents were when she threw a glass bottle at me, and luckily missed. She also threw a massive hardback textbook into my gut because she got mad at me about something. She’s choked me out on her floor before too. 
One time I vividly remember and often have nightmares about is this one time where she was mad at me about something I didn’t do, and she pushed me onto the cement floor, grabbed a fist full of my hair, and began slamming my head into the floor repeatedly. The whole while shouting “Fucking Bitch!” and saying things like “Kill yourself.” or insinuating that she’s going to kill me in my sleep with my woodcarving knife. 
Now that we are adults, she doesn’t physically do anything to me. But she still tells our mom that she thinks I’m not going to make it through college and that I’ll drop out, or she goes around telling people who know me that I’m “Satan.” She even scoffed at a classmate of mine who recognized her at work when the friend mentioned how gentle and quiet I am.
Now I have really bad anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and I’m constantly paranoid about everything. My friends can’t toss anything to me or raise their hands near me because I instinctively flinch now.
So I’m not really sure if this is just a bad case of sibling rivalry or if it counts as abuse.
Also, my parents did what they could to stop these incidents, but they weren’t home much, so I don’t blame them for it.",ShyArtist118,2020-02-06 16:23:14,2,617,13.89,52.59,83.75,1,17.63,13.61,94.17,60.29,24.15,18.31,10.21,1.13,1.13,4.86,0.97,5.83,3.89,11.67,8.43,7.78,9.24,2.11,17.83,4.7,2.11,1.78,1.46,1.46,7.62,1.62,6,0.49,2.59,1.46,16.53,2.59,1.13,6.97,0,13.45,1.46,1.46,1.94,4.21,1.78,5.51,3.4,0.65,2.11,0.65,1.46,0.97,0.49,0.16,0,8.59,4.05,0.32,1.78,1.3,1.13,6.32,9.4,0.49,16.53,2.43,6.81,7.46,1.13,0.49,0.49,0,0.16,0.32,0.49,0.32,0,0,0.16,0,16.86,5.35,5.02,0,0,0.16,0.16,0.32,1.94,3.57,0.32,0

f03s8b,Feeling trapped in my head,"When I was a kid, abuse shaped the way my brain developed, causing hallucinations from trauma.  I can't get the screaming or the voices out of my head at night.  I drink and smoke with my bros to forget, and after a little while it feels like I have a normal life.

Someone lived in my head for many years and I feel like I'll never be as great as her.  She isn't even real.  Everything that happened to me was real, though.

I tried having a second chance at growing up around 21.  It ended badly at a party in the middle of the night.  I can't escape the pain from my past and incidents happen every year.  

Aside from one time, I never reported the assaults or abuse because my family gives me grief over having pain.  I am a burden because they believe I just need to nut up and move on.

f09ckn,My dad overreacting and threaten my life over an Xbox One controller.,"I'm sorry in advance for the run on sentences. This is a long one I'm sorry. 6 hours ago my dad freaked out on me and threaten to beat me to death over an Xbox One controller that was in my younger brother's bedroom. I'm 22 and my brother is 17.

I honestly don't remember/know how it got upstairs and neither does my brother so we don't know how it ended up there. After smacking me in my face and knocking my glasses off my face, we went downstairs where my mom is and she proceeded to take the side of my brother and dad saying how I ""don't take responsibility for anything I do"" even though I have no reason for taking it since I already have one controller in my room. My dad pulled the whole ""get out of my house"" routine after yelling about how he wished both my brother and I never existed and yelling at me to look for work. 

I... then threw the accusation that dad doesn't care that my brother wants to transition and it might have been uncalled for but he hasn't made any appointments for him since coming out to them back in December. After I said that they started yelling about how I'm no good and how I'm not going with then on vacation. They try to make me feel bad and say in the real world if I ""talk like that"" they would supposedly beat me 100% of the time and kill me as if that totally makes sense. My dad added how he would applaud them for doing that and say he would want them to ""hurt me more"". Just to remind you this was over an Xbox One controller.

f09vre,mums boyfriend physically hurt me and my mum thinks its nothing.,"my mums new boyfriend has annoyed me and been trying to make me upset ever since i first met him, he would constantly try to get a reaction out of me and was rather physical and hard, he would poke and nudge me alot and act like a plain asshole, and now just today he ended up being really rough to the point where i was telling him stop repeatedly which he wouldnt listen to and had to kick him to get away from him as he was restraining my arms army type, giving me a chinese burn and twisting my arm by my finger, and nudged me really hard in the stomache. his reason was, oh hes a boy so im treating him like one we were just playing rough. keep in mind hes a grown man whos had military training so is incredibly strong compared to me and 9verpowered me easily, and even said he could throw me out the window if i wanted. i ended up getting o it of the house and talked to my mum who made excuses for him, saying how i was laughing, even though she knows both her and i laugh when were uncomfortable. and telling me to apologise to him for hurting him when i was fighting back in self defence. my mum has always ignored how i felt saying i was overexadurating but i was so mad, she was there when it happened and when i asked her hey can you get your boyfriend to stop she did nothing. after a couple of panic attacks alot of crying and a fight with my mum about the rational thing to do, she insisted i come out and talk to him which i refused because im shit scared of him, im terrified hell try and lecture me and yell, i hate yelling. my dad was very verbally abusive in the past. after refusing to see him and asking my sister to come and pick me up he stormed into my bedroom and started yelling at me calling me pathetic, a dissapointment, and when i called him fucked up he says, LOOK IN THE MIRROR BUDDY YOURE THE ONE WHOS FUCKED UP. he yelled so loudly and wouldnt listen to me when i told him to get out of my room, so i ended up yelling as well no longer anxious about him sewing me crying, because hed already seen me have a panic attack now, i just started screaming at him and panicking even more, i thought hes going to hit me, i grabbed my ukulele as self defence in case he got close, and my mum being the bitch she is asks in a small voice, ""okay maybe we should stop"" YEAH NO SHIT, SAY IT LOUDER, ANY RATIONAL PARENT WOULD SEE ALL THIS STUFF AND BE LIKE GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE! but of course she didnt. i said i wouldnt talk to him and never wanted to see him again, and she said okay ill get him to leave, which she lied about at first, she said calm down and then hell leave, she actually thought when i was calm from panicking that would make me feel different about being physically hurt and would come out and talk to him and say im sorry for hurting you in self defence, you hurt my feeeelings uwu, LIKE FUCK NO. i dont want anything to do with this sexist asshole abuser. my sister is currently on her way to pick me up because even though hes gone i still dont feel comfortable. and my mum is treating this like shes a ten year old as usual, ""fine have youre way, thanks alot now ive lost another boyfriend"" well fuck you mum just because youre scared of dying alone doesnt mean you should do anything about youre abusive boyfriend. i think ive given up on humanity at this point. im surprisingly not surprised by the way my mums acting about this and that hurts even more. i thought after all the shitty abusive boyfriends shes been through she would understand and not once again act as if everything is about her and her boyfriend. she promised me if anyone ever hurt or touched me shed break up with them because her kids come first. so i guess that was a fucking lie. when she said hes gone and i asked for good she said yes. are they broken up now? no. so they will see each other again and ill have to deal with him. no thank you. id much rather die",evidael49,2020-02-07 04:35:15,6,783,14.3,64.46,28.68,1,29,13.15,96.04,60.41,22.86,19.54,10.09,0.26,1.4,7.41,0.38,3.32,3.07,12.9,9.45,7.66,9.71,2.17,22.73,5.11,2.43,2.17,0.89,1.66,10.09,2.55,7.54,1.28,3.96,1.66,18.39,1.79,1.02,4.09,6,10.6,1.79,2.17,2.55,2.04,1.28,2.3,6.13,0.77,3.07,2.3,2.55,1.15,0.64,0.77,0,6.9,1.79,0.89,2.68,1.15,0.38,7.15,12.39,0.38,13.41,1.53,5.75,6.13,0.26,0.13,0.64,0,0.26,0.26,2.94,1.79,0.13,0.51,0.38,0,8.05,3.07,4.21,0,0,0.13,0.13,0,0.51,0,0,0
f0coet,absolution from a friend,"my previous relationship started getting really abusive around about the same time as my best friends wedding. she had named me as one of her best people, and i was overjoyed. however the problems in my relationship came to the fore and i spent the day stressed and drunk at the pressure my ex was putting me under.  this was about 2 years ago. i have never spoken to my best friend about it because i felt ashamed that my  issues impacted on me being a good best man at her wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

a few days ago i was out for a drink with her and she was complaining about her other best person and how she didn't step up during the day and make my friend the priority. without thinking i said 'neither did i'. she responded saying that she knows what i was going through and she didn't blame me and that the situations were not the same. that i shouldn't feel guilty.

f0eb2p,Son Is Asking About His Dad And Bullies Explained It To Him,"So my son has been asking a lot about his dad. I fell pregnant with him at ten and he is ten now and asking questions as many kids do. My fiance has taken on the fathering role of him but there is a significant colour difference in our skin and he is starting to notice it. Problem is so are the other kids in his class and they are bullying him for it.

Anyway my mother recently came on scene and found out from my abuser's ex wife what happened and that my son exists. She wanted custody, didn't get it. She now is telling the parents of known bullies and one of the kids told my son in detail at the start of the week about who his dad is. None of us have been dealing with it well and I think that once my son starts therapy, a lot of things will unfold. I am so sick of my mother ruining my life, first as a child now as a mother.

f0hcz2,Is this considered abuse?,"Sorry for my english.

When I was 15 my mother sent me on weekends to where my father lived. We were (and still are) poor, so he had only large bed and I had to sleep with him.

Well, he masturbated next to me. I don't know if it was the first time but he woke me up (he moved A LOT it would have been impossible to stay asleep). After that I calmly got up and immediately left, he opened the door for me and that was it.

He did the same the next weekend, and after that I never went to sleep at the same bed as him. I simply decided to not sleep or sleep on the ground or the chair. 

Some time after that her employee (that was kind of my friend) told me that he was complaining about me not sleeping/sleeping on a chair.

When I stayed awake I did never hear him doing noises either.

f0l7ka,I'm just really numb,"I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 5 years now. The longest relationship I have ever had. There were some doozies before him. I was never in a good place when I was younger, and the men i dated were bad guys. Druggies and dealer types. The current guy I'm with is the complete opposite. Had a good full time job, never hit me, made me feel safe. It was really nice ya know?

But... recently, I've felt less and less. Like my emotions are being drained out of me slowly every day. Within the last couple months, he has been so verbally aggressive towards me. I'll not understand what he said, or not hear a question he asked, and he just starts yelling at me. With this tone that just makes me feel like the dumbest person he's ever laid eyes on. It's reached the point where I don't even want to really talk when I'm at home to avoid upsetting him. Like I'm walking on egg shells all the time. 

I've become so submissive, and he knows that if he just get a tiny bit aggressive or loud towards me I will instantly fold and apologize. I'm making myself sick really. He doesn't hit me, or anything physical. (I'd like to think that if he ever did I would instantly leave him, but at this point i'm not sure any more) He just... talks down to me and no longer seems to care about my interests or my feelings. 

When I try to talk about my stories that I write, or some art that I'm working on, he like... blames me for things not being done? like my stories being unfinished and my embroidery not being done. Its reached the point where I don't even do any hobbies any more. I just feel like such a wussy because he doesn't hit me, he's not rough with me, in fact anytime he touches me he's very gentle. But... I'm constantly questioning what I did wrong. Or why he's upset, and when I ask he just gets even more mad. 

He tells me that he has always talked to me this way, and that I'm always just trying to be a victim. And I mean sure. Maybe I am just being to sensitive or something. You know what they say, 'Once a victim always a victim' is something that I have tried to not think to myself. Like I've lived through worse things but I don't think I have ever felt this bad about myself. 

I've become so insecure. I hate my body, I hate any stories I can manage to write, I have drawn away from my co-workers. And everyone has started to notice at work. Asking if I'm okay, and if everything is alright. What the hell do I say to that? 'No, my boyfriend said something mean today' like I'm some highschool girl? No. No way.

f0rblq,everything is my fault I guess,"for context: i am an lgbt person that was in a same sex relationship for 4 1/2 years. we were long distance (about 300 miles) but i moved in with her in august shortly after our 4th anniversary. i moved because my family was abusing me. 
and i NEED somewhere to rant because she took my whole friend group with her. 

starting about a year ago she was hammering me about opening our relationship. i kept saying i wasn’t sure about it but she was so sure and wanted it so badly. to give her credit, she asked if she could “make out with the birthday girl” and i said sure. i’m not mad about that, she asked. and i didn’t think it’d bother me like it did. but it did, and it was the WORST feeling in the world (note: i have nothing against poly relationships, it’s just not for me). there was never a real apology from her, even though she pressured me into saying yes - though *i* apologized for getting upset. 

she left me sitting on the floor, in hysterics while she was doing everything but physically touching me about how pathetic i was for crying. that was the last straw i think. 

when i moved in with her, i got a job, but they only gave me 3hrs/wk (i was promised 20ish) and couldn’t make the first month’s rent, but i made it my next paycheck at my new job. every time from then on out, i offered to pay rent but she always said “don’t worry about it.” i TRIED, the months i had it i tried. i had to quit my job in november though due to health reasons. 

my w-2s got sent to that apartment, and i asked her to send them to me, but THREE DAYS after i asked her to do that, i got a message saying she “returned to sender” to “get even” about rent, even though she very flat out told me no (and i was even sure to spend the money on stuff for her! i thought she was just being nice).

she told me she’d kick me out by february if i didn’t get another job by then, and after sobbing on the floor, contemplating suicide (my car was bad and i had no way of going back home to my family), i stayed after i went back to my family for christmas. it wasn’t my decision but mom knew something was different and cancelled my ticket back up after christmas, she’d bought them as a gift anyway. and she got so angry, but refused to hear my side of the story and just stopped talking to me. 

after i told her “fuck you” about the w-2s, she blocked me on quite a few places so i couldn’t get a word in. and maybe it was a shitty thing to do, but she hadn’t blocked me on instagram so i just shot her a quick message then blocked her on everything else. i NEEDED to get those words out even if she deleted without seeing it. but it infuriates me that she probably didn’t read it. 

almost everybody unfriended me. i have no one or nothing left. she took everything and everyone from me.",lizardofscience,2020-02-08 05:04:54,2,557,16.07,28.88,85.96,7.25,18.57,12.39,94.61,63.91,25.31,19.39,12.21,0.54,0.18,5.92,0.54,5.75,3.95,14,7.9,7.54,8.8,3.23,19.93,3.23,1.97,0.36,1.26,0.9,4.13,1.26,2.87,0.54,1.08,0.54,15.08,0.72,0.18,6.28,0,13.29,1.44,1.26,1.62,1.97,2.87,5.57,1.62,0.18,1.08,0.36,0.9,0.18,0.36,0.36,0,6.82,2.51,0.72,0.9,1.97,0.72,11.31,4.67,0.72,15.8,1.8,7.72,7,1.44,0.9,1.44,1.62,0.36,0.18,0.9,0.36,0.18,0.18,0,0.18,17.06,5.03,3.95,0.36,0,0,0.18,0.54,1.8,2.69,1.8,0.72

f10iq8,"[Request] Need advice, or someone to come with me to the Dentist.","There isn’t any good way to start this, I will start out by explaining why I am here today. 

Warning in advance, I am sorry if this is all over the place. Please bare with me.

Call me Max. I’m 24 years old. I grew up in a very abusive household from ages 1-12 however the abuse didn’t start until I was at least 3 or 4. My father was an alcoholic, and it destroyed him. He would come home, and beat me. I would wake up being beaten more than I would like to remember.  i just want to make clear, I am not phishing for symphony, but rather explaining. 

Longer story cut short, my mom cried in my arms telling me she wanted to divorce my father when I was 11. My parents split, things got somewhat better until I started realizing something was wrong with me. I tried so hard to be like everyone else, but I couldn’t ever fit in because I was the awkward shy kid everyone feared. This lead me into severe depression as my anxiety both generalized and social literally disable me from preforming everyday tasks without being drenched in sweat, uncontrollable sweating, pounding heart, inability to pay attention due to the anxiety, and slurring/stumbling on my words.  It’s actually very sad what happens, anyone who enters my life simply assumes I am just, “Slow.” And they don’t give me the chance to open up. I hear it all the time. You know, those smart ass replies and then the guy winks at someone else like I don’t realize what’s happening. I’m sure you know what I mean. 

The depression had caused me to not take care of myself for many years, and as a result of it I am missing multiple teeth, and have very bad teeth. I will probably end up needed implants because of how long I waited and did this to myself.

What I am asking, is if anyone from Bergan County, New Jersey would be willing to just come with me into a dentist. You don’t have to be in the room, I just want to get over this fear. 

I would ask my family, but they aren’t the people I would prefer to be around me. As for friends, I an too embarrassed. 

I’m sorry it I wrote too much info, or if I drew this out more than it should have been. 

If we agree to meet, Safety first! You shouldn’t be alone. If no one can come with me, is there any advice someone could give me any advice? It would be nice to hear something other than, “Just get over it.” For once, because I am literally shaking and sweating uncontrollably and if I could stop it I would, I.. would.",razorgain,2020-02-08 16:27:09,1,481,22.79,16.42,88.72,1,14.58,14.55,95.01,60.5,21.41,14.55,12.47,0.21,0.83,0.62,0.42,6.86,3.33,13.72,11.85,5.2,7.48,2.49,21.21,5.41,2.7,1.66,1.87,2.7,7.9,2.08,5.61,2.08,0.83,1.66,10.19,1.25,0.42,0.42,1.04,18.5,2.49,1.87,5.61,4.78,1.66,5.82,0.83,0.21,0.42,0.21,2.7,1.87,0.83,0,0.21,7.07,1.25,1.46,2.7,1.66,1.04,3.95,12.27,0.62,13.72,2.08,6.65,5.2,0.83,0.62,0.83,0.21,0,0,0.42,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,17.67,6.65,6.24,0,0,0.21,0.21,0.21,0.83,2.7,0,0.62
f10yhx,Can you ever forgive an abuser?,"My niece (call her Elle) was 14 when a family friend who was like a grandpa to her started assaulting her. It didn’t go on for long until Elle’s father discovered the abuse. Though they pursued charges, the grandpa was released due to a lack of evidence. The family banded together to try to help Elle, getting her into therapeutic programs and her father moved them into his sister-in-laws home to better support her recovery. A few months later, it was discovered that Elle had begun abusing her 3 year old niece. She had passed on the abuse that she had endured. Elle was found guilty of child abuse and was put on probation until the time that she turned 18. With good behavior, she would not have to register as a sex offender.  As a survivor of childhood trauma myself, I had no choice but to distance myself from that branch on my family and have had no contact with Elle or her father for years. Elle recently turned 18 and was taken off parole. I’m struggling because if I cannot forgive Elle now, I may never again have a relationship with her side of the family.  As important as my family is to me, I cannot ever forget that she raped a toddler.

f17egw,My brother punched me once and I have a question,"First of all to notify English is not my native language so this post might have bad grammar. 
He was around 12-13 and I was around 7-8. We were in our aunts house. We were there about for hours. Then we decided to go at about like 2 at night. My brother was tying his shoe and everyone were waiting. I guess he didnt notice people wew waiting behind him. Then I said something like ""be quick"". Then he turned and punched me in stomach. He never hit me before this and after. So after he punched me my parents didnt say anything in front of our aunt and other relatives (who were shocked). Then we got to the car and they were very angry angry about him. I dont remember what they said there though. I didnt speak or play with my brother for few days but after few days he apologized to me.
I was shocked then angry. But I dont think it had any lasting effects or even it did it was a light effect. Is there anything wrong about continuing my relationship with him?

In the college I used to attend, there was this rude and racist girl, when ever I see her around (We were just strangers/an acquaintance)

She usually hangs out in a gang and badmouths others who she thinks are low life behind their backs. 
One time, in the college lounge with vending machines, I have seen her intimate another girl who she viciously grabs from behind and badmouths her Infront of everyone, she was upset and so myself and my classm stepped back to have our lunches outside as the argument went on.

f1bdwq,Why are parents consciously abusive,"It’s disgusting. My mom is and has been abusive to me and my siblings since forever now. It’s crazy to me how parents are aware of their actions, they know they’re hurting their own children who are vulnerable and supposed to depend on them. Yet they continue to cause us harm? I don’t understand how anyone could possibly hurt their own children. They’re supposed to raise them and help them grow, but instead some parents choose to do the opposite, and emotionally and mentally stunt their kids. Like my mom, even when she uses a nicer softer tone of voice, I immediately feel so vulnerable and scared, not being used to the unfamiliar tone of her voice. Since she’s always screaming at me and yelling at me with such an angry, unwelcoming tone :( But my mom does have a favorite. My mom has a favorite child, my brother. I know he’s her favorite because she treats him better than the rest of us, with respect. It’s always been this way. To this day I fail to understand why she would ever do that, why she would ever treat the rest of her children like scum, while she treats one child like an actual human person. How could she ever have the audacity to do that!? How could she guilt trip my sister for her history of child abuse with my dad, while she shows some concern for my brother? I don’t understand abusive parents and I never will. I can’t possibly sympathize with them after everything I’ve witnessed and experienced because of them. How do abusive parents come to be? I don’t understand.

f1c8sm,Assaulter moved 10 minutes away from me.,"Hello,

I am trying to figure out how to navigate this. I am a woman of Asian descent who made some dating mistakes in her 20s. Fortunately, I am happily married to a wonderful man now. Here is what is going on:

In 2013, I took a class and this guy was apparently obsessed with me. I thought nothing of it, but then we started texting each other at the end of the class and there was obvious attraction. Later, we meet up a few times as he lives in Arizona and I lived in California, and he was going to teach English in China. He asked to meet up for Karaoke in L.A. with his brother and another lady friend. Thinking there was a fellow lady there, I thought it would be okay to go.

So, what I didn't know is that he would try to assault me during this session while his brother and lady friend were there. I ran out of the room and laid down on the couch not knowing what to do, and made a cop-out excuse that I needed to go home. This was before the ""Me Too"" movement and this whole time I thought it was my fault and I did not sign up for him to try to assault me. Had I known what I know now, I would have reported this.

Little did I know, he was one of those racist dudes with an Asian fetish who fetishized the women but made awful derogatory and racist remarks against Asian men. This guy was in the military and who knew there were attitudes like this in people who ""serve the country""? He is also very short and insecure about it, so that may be where that comes from.

Of course, me being an insecure 26 year old at the time thought it was my fault and I kept talking to him while he was in China. I thought I couldn't find anyone better at the time, so was trying to work on this. Later I learned of a..let's call her ""Betsy"". He and Betsy were sleeping together, and he boasted that he can get what he wants from her because she wants a Green Card and wants to move to America and that he is stringing her along. As time goes by, he says Betsy has picked up all of my hobbies and that maybe I can teach her a thing or two. This creeps me out. He keeps reaching out to me, and we keep talking- until one day I have enough and I call him a ""pick-up"" artist and that he's just trying to mold Betsy's personality from mine. Then he gets mad, and minutes later, Betsy logs into his account and tells me that I'm clingy and that I should essentially go away. So she not only tries to hijack my hobbies, but the way she was talking makes me think that she has been reading mine and his exchanges this whole time.

ANYWAYS, if you are still reading this- here is where is starts to get weird. I move to a city a few states away in March of 2016 to start a new life over. So he no longer knows where to find me, and to start a new life away from my childhood abuse. Within a few weeks, I meet the love of my life who I eventually married in 2019. My then-bf now-husband posts openly on his Facebook about where he is and is public about what we are up to.

Months later, a mutual friend alerts me that my assaulter is moving to my city. He apparently tried to cross paths with me but failed and then he imported Betsy from China and then moved to the East Coast to initiate the green card process. Then in 2017 they move to my city together...and not only my city but freaking 10 MINUTES AWAY FROM ME!!! This means I might run into them at the only Costco in town, at the rail line, or they can run into my beloved husband and manipulate him or something. I wouldn't put it past him if he applied to my husband's old work places as he is suddenly trying to copy my husband's exact career path!!! (My husband is on LinkedIn).

I know the question is like....how the hell do you know all this? I have a friend that is warning me, and I feel a weird sense of impending doom and that I have to watch my tracks now. I hate him and his wife so much and wish they stayed in China, or his home state. Why the fuck are they here?

What can I do to stay safe? I don't know how to even go about reporting this to the police without it becoming a mess, and technically what he is currently doing is legal so fuck. It's technically been 6 years since the attempted physical assault too.

TL;DR: My old assaulter moved 10 minutes away from me and I don't know what to do if I accidentally come across him or his wife.",GuerillaRebelRevolt,2020-02-09 09:56:45,3,875,34.54,54.99,66.42,5.26,19.44,12,91.89,61.94,21.71,15.2,8.46,0.57,0.23,5.37,0.57,6.51,4.91,14.4,8.57,5.6,8.57,1.37,18.97,2.86,1.37,2.51,1.37,1.26,4,1.03,2.97,0.34,1.37,0.23,13.14,1.26,1.14,1.83,5.83,10.74,3.2,1.6,1.71,2.63,0.57,2.4,0.8,0.34,0.23,0.11,1.49,0.11,0.8,0.46,0,8.69,3.54,1.49,2.74,0.57,0.69,4.8,11.77,1.83,16.57,2.63,8,6.06,1.71,0.57,0.46,0.23,0.23,0,0.91,0.46,0.11,0.11,0,0.11,13.6,5.6,3.31,0.23,0.11,0.46,0.69,0.69,0.91,1.37,0.23,0
f1di8z,Psych ward,"When I was 14 I was sent to my first psych ward where I stayed for 5 months. I was never the same again. 

On my first night a girl was left to hit her head against the wall until she vomited and passed out and started seizing. The staff said she was faking and I had to put her in the recovery position. 

It became clear very soon that the patients were neglected. We would be left to injure ourselves and purge, but would sometimes be restrained for the slightest misdemeanour. I was once restrained for pouring shower gel on the floor and playing with it. 6 people jumped on me and shook and punched me when I moved. 

On more than one occasion male staff members would come into my room when o was shirtless and stare at my breasts. An elderly nurse undressed one girl during an episode and made creepy comments to all of us. She would tuck a particular girl in whilst touching her body.

The only member of staff I trusted was Adam, who would talk to me about documentaries and tell me about his childhood in Ghana. He seemed nice but a bit thick, very innocent. One day he disappeared. 

One day the poultice came in to talk to us. I assumed it was about the elderly nurse, but they said it was about Adam. He'd been sexually abusing the patients. I found out years later that this abuse took the form of coercion and oral sex in the case of one girl, and violent rape in the case of another. 

Unable to cope, I started trashing my room and being generally destructive. I got arrested several times. 

The staff failed to protect me from a couple of patients who bullied me and one who manipulated me to the point of attempting suicide. As a higher functioning patient, I took it upon myself to stay with the vulnerable schizophrenics to try and prevent them from being abused. I got restrained and sedated frequently for minor minor misbehaviours. 

I begged my parents to take me home but I wouldn't. 

Eventually I got kicked out for repeatedly escaping and taking other patients with me. I'd broken a lot of rules by doing things like brewing cider in my cupboard and having a relationship with two of the girls. 

Since I left, two patients have committed suicide, including one who was my first kiss. Adam is on trial for multiple counts of rape. 

I find it hard to trust people. I spend a lot of time alone. 

None of us will ever be quite the same again",DustyAndRusty,2020-02-09 11:20:57,4,443,72.35,48.19,71.34,7.51,13.84,17.16,88.26,54.4,16.25,12.64,8.8,1.13,0,2.26,0.45,3.61,6.55,15.8,7.45,4.29,6.32,0.68,15.8,3.61,2.03,1.81,3.61,2.26,4.29,1.35,2.93,0.45,1.58,0.68,9.48,0.23,0,2.48,1.13,7.22,1.13,0.68,1.35,1.81,1.13,1.58,1.81,0.68,0.45,0.68,2.93,1.13,1.13,1.13,0,9.03,2.26,1.58,2.71,1.58,1.35,9.26,3.39,0.68,16.48,2.48,7.22,7.22,1.58,0.23,0.9,0.23,0,0.45,0.23,0,0.23,0,0,0,9.48,6.77,2.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.68,0,0

And im scared that if i try to get help I'll be stuck at this home because what if they don't count emotional abuse as abuse and my dad gets very very mad at me


Maybe its not abuse because he gets me stuff like a phone and art things and maybe im just overreacting and this is like normal parents because during those small peroids of time when he isn't mad he's nice to us.

f1h90w,Mum's bf touched me and did stuff that made me feel dirty and disgusting,"When my dad died it left a big hole in our family. I watched as my mum became depressed and longed for my dad to come back and for us to be a happy family again. I miss my dad every single day and I hope he's happy wherever he is now.

When my Mum met Jamie, though, it was like that fire inside her had been relit. He made her so happy and for the first time in forever I saw her smile and laugh.

Things started getting weird though when me and him were alone. It started with him calling me his precious ""baby boy"" or ""daddy's little boy"" and stroking my legs when I was in bed or sat on the sofa in the lounge. Then he started taking my clothes off and touching my body and saying how much he loved me. I thought he was being nice at first just felt weird about it but then he started touching areas that I really felt uncomfortable with and asking me to do things I didn't want to.

I didn't want to tell my mum because it would destroy her and I couldn't tell anyone else because they'd end up telling someone else and creating a problem that I wanted to avoid. I wanted my mum to be happy so I told nobody.

I couldn't get it out of my head though, every time I looked in the mirror I'd see ""daddy's little boy"" and wanted to tear my face off. In school I'd get taken out of lessons because I ended up crying and they'd ask me what was wrong and I wouldn't tell them or I'd blame it on lack of sleep. I was determined to stay strong for my mums sake though so I kept trying to Bury my emotions and act normal as best I could.

He kept coming, and coming, and coming. And started making me suck him off and doing stuff to me that made me feel dirty and disgusting. I kept having melt downs at school and people started asking questions which made things way worse because my lack of sleep response was making them ask why wasn't I sleeping. What's causing my problems? Nothing dw I'd say, I'm just being stupid. They didn't believe me but that's the only answer I'd give them.

It got to the point where I desperately wanted to talk to someone just to unload some of the burden of how I was feeling, but I could not allow my mum to find out because I knew it would totally destroy her if she did. She's feel hurt and betrayed and probably never trust anyone ever again and she'd end up back in that depressed state I never wanted to see her in again. I could not be responsible for that. So I told nobody.

Eventually I plucked up the courage to contact Childline as they offer anonymous councilling support and I thought I might be able to trust them not to tell someone else while maybe, hopefully, helping me to stay strong and deal with everything. Over the last few weeks I spent probably around 20 hours or so in total talking to different councillors and one of the things they suggested was making a secret log of everything that happened, when it happened, in case I ever decided to tell someone else. They kept encouraging me to tell someone but, at the same time, they seemed to understand why I didn't want to. So we'd soldier on and it felt good talking to someone even if they weren't able to do much other than listen and offer friendly advice.

A few days ago I plucked up the courage to threaten Jamie and said to him that I wasn't comfortable doing this stuff any more and if he didn't stop I'd tell my mum. Truth is I wouldn't tell because I didn't want to destroy her but I thought if I said that it might scare him into stopping. Unfortunately he reacted very angrily to this threat and grabbed me by the throat and threatened to kill me if I told anyone. I did not sleep that night... At all. And the next day in school I was like a ghost all day.

After school on Friday I went and sat in the park with my friend and they kept trying to get me to talk but I wouldn't. Eventually they had to go home for dinner and I told them I'll be fine and not to worry so they went. I just sat there on the bench for an hour crying after that.

I contacted Childline again that evening and told them what had happened and how scared I was to go home and that was when they called the police who came to the park and took me somewhere safe. I didn't need to explain everything to them as they'd already been told what was going on so I felt better about that. At this point I was mixed emotions, I felt safe but also anxious about what was going to happen to my mum as the exact thing I was trying to avoid had now happened. Mums bf was arrested shortly after 8pm on Friday night and I spent most of Saturday lying in bed and cuddling with my mum.

f1o5ge,I'm tired of being nice to him.Even if it will get me killed / [NSFW],"50 year old men usually start to have a midlife crisis.Some go on a roll and kill their wives,children,family just because they are all crazy.

I am tired being fake nice to the man in our house just because he is a pot that will explode.

I have been suffering my entire childhood into my adult life because of his pornography addiction.

He yelled at our household like crazy when I was a teenager.He yelled so hard the entire neighbourhood stopped.He stopped that know.He would beat our dog endlessly,encouraging me to beat it too.The dog is in a good place now because of cancer,but we could never give her a good life,and it will haunt me until I die.

I heard him furiously masturbate and moan from a young age.Buying porn related things with me seeing it as a child,in crowded supermarkets.Make me even pack that into a grocery bag.

All my life I wished I was exaggerating.

I won't mentioned how manipulative and verbally abusive he is.

How charming he is to other because he is a total sociopath.

I want to treat him like shit,I don't care that in his core he is dangerous.

He ruined my life.He ruined my trust of others.He ruined my relationships and sex life.He ruined my education because of his childish manipulation games.

f1s1sm,Was this abusive?,"Looking back on my childhood I really struggle to remember anything from around 12 and under, but I’ve got a handful of memories of my dad that don’t seem too bad in my mind, but also seem like they could kind of count as abuse.

He’d do things like make me walk through mud with bare feet in winter, hold onto the back of my neck in public and massage it to the point where it hurt so bad but I was too afraid to say anything, buy me things I really wanted but then say I could only have them when I went to his house. He also got into bed with me once and made me read my book to him out loud (I hated reading aloud, but did it for a little bit until I was uncomfortable because he was getting close to me). I politely shut the book and said I wanted to go to sleep, and he got up, screamed at me and slammed my door. He used me to try and get his girlfriend to be nice to him when they were breaking up by taking me to their house without telling me anything was wrong and without warning her, and last time I saw him he screamed and threatened me and called me and my mum names while he was driving me home because I said I had a school project to do which may mean I’d have to miss seeing him one weekend. I blocked most of that out but I remember being scared out of my mind and feeling like he was actually going to kill me. He’d drop gifts off at my house like diamond earrings and money, but stopped when I wouldn’t reach out and give him attention. He’d call me with a disguised voice and try and get me to go somewhere with him, when I’d realise it was him id start crying and he’d be all confused saying he never did anything to upset me. I saw him once since that last incident at a show and he knew I was there but just kept circling me and getting near me, never even looking me in the eye. It was like he was purposefully trying to unnerve me but also refusing to even acknowledge me or give me the time of day. He’s avoided paying lots of bills/ child support by claiming bankruptcy and is basically a criminal in the money sense, but I also suspect he might be a sociopath.

f1xx44,"I keep falling back into the ""maybe it was my fault"" mindset","I know it's wrong, I've figured out everything (with evidence to back up my claims), but I still fall into the ""maybe it was my fault"" mindset. It's insidious, and once it takes hold it takes ten times the effort to escape that pit. However, some of my little strategies may help some of you, so allow me to rant.

1. Realize that you weren't perfect, but you weren't the cause
2. Understand that you are the victim, no matter how many offramps your brain takes to tell you that you weren't. 
3. Sit and think, do something mindless for a bit, then when your thinking ""levels off"" do something you enjoy or something that inspires you.
4. Think back to how your life has actually changed. How much you were held back, how much you weren't allowed to enjoy things, how you were treated as less-than-human, a mere object for their amusement.

Simple, and not the fastest, but they help bring me out of that funk for a good period of time. Someday I may not need to use strategies at all, but that day is a long way off.

f1z9tl,I recently discovered I may be repressing some shit which raised questions on my past reactions to certain things. If this is normal or not please let me know! (CSA minor mention TW/minor medical check up TW),"I am a female and when I was 11 I went in for my obligatory and very first physical. The doctor was a very kind but quiet older man and I feel bad for causing any sorta issue with him if I had. He was nothing but professional. But that didn't change the fact that when it was time for me to change into a gown with only my trainer beneath and I had to lay down and open my legs for the exam I began to feel terrified and sobbed. He tried to reassure me but eventually just carried on but everything just made me feel so horrible and gross. My step mom sat in a chair, phone in hand and half hearted reassuring me from the sidelines but thought I was being overdramatic. 

I understood he was just doing his job and was very kind but that didn't change the terror I felt the whole time nor the shame after. I watched the ceiling as I cried the whole time and then the floor later as my step mom and him talked nonchalantly about me and my progress in puberty. Even now 8 years later I've dodged every opportunity in which anyone would have to touch me there again for check ups and things and that fear/discomfort/shame never left. 

I've felt similar when recalling events where I was groped and interacting with one of my assaulters brings me the same fear and shame. I can only currently remember the groping(which was years after the physical) but my drastic reaction to such a normal procedure and other issues have made me consider the possibility something else might have happened.

f253wu,Angry that mandated reporters didn’t do their job?,"I was molested for many years by my uncle. I told my parents around age 16. Thankfully, they believed me right away. My aunt (mom’s sister) continued to stay married to him, but he was not allowed at any family events.

After telling my parents, I mentioned it to my psychiatrist (I’ve got adhd) because I wanted a anti-depressant.

He didn’t provide any psyched on therapy options and I don’t know what I needed at the time).

So I’m gonna start this off by saying that when I was younger, I was physically abused by my dad. It was a constant thing that happened. I’ve always felt like it was my fault, like I was bad and he got tired of me doing whatever I did to piss him off. 

Ever since then, I’ve always had this need to be deemed as “good”. As someone who is in their place, someone who’s willing to do anything for someone if they asked nicely or someone who’s just nice and polite, you know?

Because of that, I’ve had a huge attachment to the nickname “good girl” or “angel”

f2e0ph,My story,"i'm never sure where to tell this but i feel like i should. (its long like really long) 

i feel like to understand you need all of the story so, sorry in advance. i'm hoping maybe there has been someone in a similar situation out there and gotten through it somehow. there is custody stuff but its closer to the end i'm trying to paint a picture of my ex first 

sorry again i have no idea where to put commas, and periods i just try my best to guess. 

i met my ex when i was 15 and he was 31 or 32 i wanted someone to buy me cigarettes, we met online on a site called vampire freaks.  i don't really know what made me think this was a good idea but i did it regardless. 

so we met up in a public place and he just swore so much especially the C word which made me uneasy, but i'd already gone this far  he was paranoid so he wouldn't go into the store of my choosing.. 

and so we drove to one a few minutes away he went in got them but when i went to grab them and get out of the car he was like no not here you know this is illegal right and i was like okay lets go back to where we met, and he instead thought we should go for a walk. so we went to this park that was close by with walking trails and he gave me the box and i awkwardly walked with him and finally asked if i could go home now, and he was all like yeah sure no problem! and he dropped me back off where i met him so i thought well that wasn't too bad met up with him again 2 more times same situation, but the last time i met with him he went off the trail into the woods and i just stood there like ??? and he said ""aren't you coming"" and i was like idk man and he was like ""what i'm not going to do anything"" so we walk a bit and we end up stopping at a fallen tree and we're just talking, and he pulls me in closer and i didn't really know what to do he started kissing my neck and feeling up my non existent chest and then he put his hand down my pants and i froze for about 30 seconds and just pulled away. and i was like what are you doing?! and he said ""well i thought you were into me"" and i said no and i wanted to go home so i did and that was the end of that..

until i turned 17 JUST 17 he hit me up and at this point i'd gotten around a bit.. and i was at the peak of my teenage rebellion, so i was like booze? h\*ll yeah bud i'm down. so i snuck out of my apartment to meet up and go to his house, he had been to a funeral and been drinking so a buddy was driving him. i was so scared to get in the car, but i did and we got to his house everything was fine other then the anxiety. so he goes to pour our drinks, but i was so nervous i threw up i was so embarrassed so we layed in his bed cuddling watching movies, and well yeah it still happened. so he drives me home at about 5 am, before my mom would wake up. and yeah anyway he goes back to alberta (i'm in ontario) and he messaged me all angry that i forgot his birthday, (when i didn't even know his birthday)  and i'm confused because i figured 1 night stand and honestly i would have been fine with that outcome, but no he's like well you're my girlfriend.... so i just went a long with it, he came back to visit in 2 or 3 months so i went over for the weekend. blah blah blah he seemed charming, and sweet and all that. we had similar music taste, and he had lots of tattoos, so he seemed super cool at the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

so he goes back to Alberta and gets laid off, ends up moving back but he ""couuld have taken a different job"" and he ""came back for me"" bulls\*it. i of course went over for the weekend as it had been about 2 months since i saw him, and i was pretty attached already. that weekend i ended up telling him i loved him, and later that day he said it back but.... the girl i was using to cover for me told my parents who i was with, so they start calling me and freaking out, my dad is looking for me. so i get home and they lose it, they threaten to call the police but i convince them not to because i love him. i really wish they just called on him.. i still end up sneaking out to see him and stuff and eventually my mom just gives up and lets me do what i want. so we're together for about 9 months? around abouts anyway, and i break up with him because he's controlling, and manipulative, and is physically and verbally attacking his  brother regularly. so i started seeing someone else for about a month. he called me names, he was all sweet then he was awful again, everyday it was something different. but one night i was in the shower, and the song pale blue eyes by the velvet underground came on, and my heart just broke. i missed him so much so i texted him to come over, and he did, and we got back together. 

&amp;#x200B;

we ended up driving out to Alberta in January because he didn't want to switch his licence plate to ontario?  so we end up stuck there for a few extra days. but i didn't get my period and i just knew .. so when we got back to Ontario i took a test, and yup turns out i got knocked up on my 18th birthday exactly. so i tell him and he just says ""so you're gonna take care of that right?""and i didn't understand what he meant and he said ""you're going to get an ABORTION right?!"" and i said f\*ck no because i said i wouldn't ever get one myself unless it was life threatening. i loved kids and i always wanted to be a mother,  i basically raised my siblings from the age of 6, so it wasn't a big deal for me. and it was something i thought i was good at, so i was sure i was keeping it. 

and he was just so so unbelievably angry and depressed, which i guess i do understand now. but i said he wouldn't have to be involved if he didn't want, i gave him a clear out for months, but he just kept sulking about it. when i went in for my first ultrasound i had to drink a lot of water, so he's late picking us up so we start walking, he's mad i didn't wait for him and whatnot. anyway he's driving with his permanent road rage on as usual, which i'm used to but they weren't, so he scared the sh\*t out of them.  i'm a VERY small woman so i was so full from the water it was hard to walk around, so i'm just hanging off of him in pain at this point. and he's says to stop embarrassing him, and he's just being an absolute total \*sshole infront of my sister and mother, starts sh\*t talking me when we get inside and so.. i shoved  him away from me, and i guess into a wall, it wasn't hard or anything but i still regret it.  but he just stopped talking to me, so we get in, i get the scan, and everyone is then able to come in and we all see him for the first time.  me, my mother, and sister were pretty much in tears and so excited, and he just sulked and was angry about it. he never came to any appointments except this one, and the second ultrasound, where we found out it was a boy. he was sort of happy about it, and said if it was a girl, he would have left because ""all girls are is drama b\*tches and sl\*ts"". 

so he pretty much remains this way the entire pregnancy, he didn't stop saying i should abort until i was 7 months pregnant, he didn't tell his family until i was 8 months pregnant, but... we were still together... not really though, as he wouldn't touch me anymore, its like i became disgusting to him. because well pregnancy changes your body, so instead of being a 30AAAcup i was a good 32B, and instead of being 70 lbs i was like 100 lbs, so he just would tell me ""ew you're gross"" whenever i tried to initiate anything. there was still emotional abuse happening, he was gaslighting me, etc etc etc. 

i'd spend 2 weeks with him, and 2 weeks at my moms, until i got close to my due date. then just stayed with my mom incase i went into labor, as i was planning to have a home birth with midwifes, because its what my mom did. so the day comes i go into labor 4 ish am but i just think its braxton hicks so i just go back to sleep thinking they'll stop, so 5 am rolls around and they've gotten a bit worse and i realize this is really happening, so i wait until my mom wakes up to tell her because i figure its gonna be a whiile. so first thing she says to me is ""no.... not today.."" so i'm like well alright.. so it gets worse fast by like 7 i was gone the contractions hurt so so bad, so we called the midwife and i was barely able to talk on the phone, told my mom to call him so he got there, and was just awkward the whole time.  i got checked at 8 am and was 4cm, and he came out at 12:14 pm. so all the fun stuff happened and i was holding baby, he got on the boob right away, and he was very healthy and all that. pretty much had to force bf to hold him, but he did. and then he changed he loved him so much it seemed, and he was careful and all that.

 i move in with him shortly after because i thought it'd be better now, its changed him,and he's going to be a good person because of his son, but no. things only got worse, i ended up getting post partum depression, and he'd just fight with me constantly, he had some serious OCD so things had to be PERFECT constantly, he was paranoid, he was angry. now this wasn't a shock it was this way the entire time, but i knew it wasn't a good environment for a child, and i was thinking about leaving for good. when my son was about 5 months old he woke up, and i fed him, and i was still laying down with my eyes closed. but he had a thing going on where if he couldn't see your eyeball he'd cry, so i was just laying there i needed 2 more minutes of just eyes closed, so kids arm is under my propped up arm and he's grabbing at my armpit, just doing a whiney cry nothing major he wasn't freaking out in the slightest. and just as i was moving to get up, bf grabs my neck, and slams me so hard into the back of the couch. he just didn't let go he had a tight hold on my throat for a good 3 minutes. and i'm just shocked he'd never grabbed me before, and he just said it was because i was crushing my sons arm, which i very much wasn't. so we start fighting about it, and i said that it wasn't okay for him to do that, and that he knows d\*mn well i wasn't hurting my son. but he wouldn't admit it.

 so i start going to womans domestic violence help, to help me leave safely. but... he finds a card in my purse so i get called out, he rips my son from my arms, and now i'm freaking out, and saying i just want to leave. and he just says ""go right ahead but he's staying here with me"" and he was eating some solids at this point, but... i was still very much breastfeeding. so i was like h\*ell no, got my mom to call the police, and i left right then with the police with my son, he looked at me and said ""you'll regret this and i'm going to take everything from you"" and i was thinking... okay sure dude... thinking no one in their right mind would give a kid to this psycho,  i don't want to go into mega detail about but it was emotional, verbal, abuse going on and i was afraid things would get physical. and as i said earlier with his brother who has Cerebral Palsy he attacked physically regularly. his brother when i lived there backed me up, and told me that i wasn't crazy, and he really was abusive and i needed to get out. to his parents he was the golden child who could do nothing wrong, so for leaving a bad situation his sister, and mother haated me, talked badly about me and believed anything that bf was telling them. 

&amp;#x200B;

so i end up in a domestic abuse shelter for a bit, its a really good place and when i can i want to give back to them.  but because i was there.... CPS had to be involved. i have the councillors on my side with don't let him see the baby, and i have CPS saying i had no choice but to let him, and he HAD to see him. they didn't believe he had been abusing me, because they visited him and he ""seemed like such an amazing guy"" so i could't really do much, i didn't trust him alone so... i supervised his visits until he freaked out that he was capable of looking after him himself. so i was now pumping all the time for milk to freeze to give to him, which he wouldn't drink because he didn't like drinking out of bottles besides the one i had which bf wouldn't take. so i was worried he would be dehydrated, and i was worried he'd miss me, even tho i was only letting him have him a few hours on Saturdays, no overnights. but i moved into my dads place, and CPS said i have to let him have overnights. i was worried he'd just take him and not give him back, but he wouldn't agree to anything to put on paper. he just kept promising he would ""neeever do anything to hurt you like that"" i finally agreed.. he had him every other weekend i think, and some Wednesdays. he would never give me child support in the form of actual money, but he would go out and buy diapers and stuff for him, so at least there was that.  he starts freaking out at me over anything, over mismatched socks, over a clashing outfit, over he's wearing pyjamas, over he has a little food on his face, like it could be ANYTHING, and he would be in hysterics. 

i eventually start seeing someone else and obviously... he was going to meet the kid but exbf did NOT like that, honestly i think it was more me being with someone else than it was him meeting my kid. so he just cranked it all the way up, freaking out over more than before. following new guy, taking photos of him, messing around with his car, breaking into his car and looking through everything(but we had no proof) he started having people follow me around, he broke into my house and slipped \*something\* i don't know what in some vodka, (which i didn't drink) and took my coat and left it neatly by the shelter i was staying at previously (also didn't have proof it was him). but i know it was him.. if you've been in these situations you just know. so one day i am 5 minutes late getting to the pickup point, which was the police station because he was ""afraid"" that i was going to hurt him. now i want to say i've waited 20 minutes for him before, and always understood if he said he was going to be late, stuff happens. so i am texting him nonstop at this point, asking where he was, and he said ""well you were late so i'm keeping him, if you want him back we need to have a serious talk"". so i was just like dude no you need to give him back, and he was like ""well..no i really don't, since its not on paper either us can keep him and not have to give him over"" so i told CPS what he did, and apparently they couldn't do anything about it, even though i HAD to let him see him. if i pulled what he did, i would have been in serious trouble. so i go to the police, there is nothing on paper so they can't do anything. i then try to say he had nude photos of my under the age of 18 which is TECHNICALLY illegal,  but i guess a grey area so.. they just tell him to delete them.  they then ask for him to give him back to me but its his choice so of course i don't get him back.  i file an emergency court thing to get him back, i got legal aid and we went to court. i can't really remember how it went down as i was so scared to just be there, and he ended up getting him more time than me, not by much i guess but still. he had him Thursday at 3 to Monday at noon, i had him Monday at noon to Thursday at 3.

the day i was in court was Thursday, so i still had to wait another 4 days to see my son that i hadn't been able to see in a month already, i was devastated. i didn't think he'd get much visitation after all he did. so another court date was set because this was temporary, which gave me hope that it'd be fine that the judge just needed to hear both sides. the next time we went in i had gotten all the proof i could that he wasn't a good father, and why he shouldn't have him. and he came back with a STACK of paper, of pretty much every single thing that made me look bad from the ENTIRE relationship, he got me talking about drinking, and smoking pot, which i never did around my son. but i still said something about it at one point so it made me look bad. he got me saying ""i feel like i'm crazy"" to his sister because.. thats what abuse does to you, but if you could see her reply to that it would have looked bad on him, because for awhile she was on my side and understood why i was leaving, she's told me that he'd done ""things"" to her when she was a teenager, but didn't say anything other than that. 

he brought up my family issues and said that my dad was touching my siblings, which he was not it was something my mom was spreading around that i was talking to her with, and then when i was with him was talking to him about it because i was upset with my mom for saying that. but he got screenshots where it looked liked i was saying i DID happen so it was a whole f\*cking mess. and nothing really came out of this court session things stayed on the temporary order, and a new date was made.

i decided to move to my own place because i could finally afford it with the child tax benifit i wasn't getting because he screwed up my taxes when we were together, (wouldn't let me file them myself and he did it) so i got a lump sum of 7k after i cleared it up and i was on OW at the time. so i moved an hour and a half away because the city i was in with my dad was wayy too expensive. and i moved where i knew someone, and where i could afford to. my first huge mistake, not telling anyone i moved, and not and not filing it.  i know now it was an awful thing to do, but i was just scared he was going to show up there and do something, because there my dad wasn't around. things started to get worse verbally, our pickup drop off point was now at a Mcdonalds.  it got to the point before i could leave with my son i'd have to get SCREAMED at in the parking lot for 45 minutes to over an hour each time about everything i was doing wrong. that i was a horrible evil person, that i was disgusting for having a boyfriend, how i was the worst mother in the entire world, and it got to me. i don't know what else to say i started drinking heavily, like drinking to function. NEVER on days i had my son if i did it was a half glass of wine when he went to bed. but when he was gone, i didn't know what to do i was so depressed, i was suicidal, i could barely get up anymore.

so .. the court day came closer and i started having seizures (which i got checked out was stress and dehydration apparently) and i was so done mentally by the time it came that... i just.... didn't go. i couldn't do it anymore, things went on as normal, he didn't say anything to me for a good month. and one day he was just like ""you know i won sole custody right? he's mine now"" and he'd go to being really snarky about it to ""i'm soooo sorry i NEVERR wanted to do this to you, but you're just not a good parent, don't you see that..? i'm doing you a favour, you knew this was coming. i'm just better than you and you can't beat me"". and i just sobbed right in the middle of Mcdonalds, losing my f ing mind got people coming up asking if i was okay, because all the workers and regulars knew who we were, they'd seen some sh\*t. an older lady had asked where my baby was because usually i'd sit have a coffee, wait for him to show up, and my kid would wave and say ""hi"" over and over to her and her husband. and i just left without saying anything to her. i went home and i drank until i passed out.

few days later he texts me wanting to talk about when i could see him, so we meet up its late like 1-2 am at a park. no one is really around he offers me a drink, and i say sure because i was nervous. he was calm he was being nice again, so i was like okay.. and he proceeds to list off all the hoops i'll have to jump through, so i can see my son again. and we're just talking and stuff i start feeling really really off so i say ""i think i'm gonna head back to my dads"" and i stand up and i get grabbed and thrown onto the picnic table, pants pulled down, i throw up and i get assaulted. he then leaves and i'm just there... so i try to get home, since it wasn't too far but i end up just getting to the bridge, and i started puking again and thank god some lady was walking by she helped me get home i think, i just kept throwing up the rest of the night. 

i then just... stopped talking to him, i shut my phone off for 3 months. i didn't mean to for that long.. i was just going to take a few days but i got scared of the spam of angry texts i was going to get when i turned it on so, i didn't turn it on. i didn't know what to do i didn't report it, because he'll find a way to use it against me. because a few days prior he was pretty much s\*xting me and i just went with it, because he had my kid, and i just wanted to do whatever to be on his good side. and he could just say that i wanted it because of that and just give screenshots, and because i lost the court case i was getting back at him. so he planned all of this out i know it. he knew i would cut contact, and i would f\*ck myself over. after the 3 months.. i finally texted him, nothing. just nothing. i tried calling nothing. i emailed nothing. but, he had sole so i couldn't do anything about it. and  to this day i can't get a hold of him he's blocked me on everything he had his family block me. if i go to his house he'll call the cops on me because its one of his favourite activities.

i have now not seen my son in 2 1/2 years, he'll be 4 in september.  its heartbreaking and i have no idea what to do, and i feel like courts don't understand these situations at all.  i feel like men are now being favoured in court, especially if the other person says they were being abused. or at least in my area. 

every few months i still try to reach out through email, because its all i can do maybe he's blocked that too but i don't know.  i'm too scared to see him face to face again, i'm too scared to go to court and piss him off. and now its been so long since i've seen my son, i don't know if he'll even remember me. and being taken away from exbf might be too hard on him, and i can't rip another parent from him, even if he's not a good one. being a bad person doesn't mean a kid won't get attached. 

if there is any questions or anything, i can elaborate of certain stuff if wanted.",alexmk97,2020-02-11 12:02:51,1,4557,9.38,46.05,63.74,14.3,23.37,10.49,93.59,65.02,23.7,18.3,10.03,0.86,0.64,6.25,0.53,5.4,3.58,12.73,10.58,8.49,10.27,2.68,22.01,3.12,1.76,1.43,1.43,1.73,4.54,1.84,2.68,0.59,0.53,0.59,14.31,1.29,0.39,0.83,6.89,11.52,1.76,1.29,2.02,2.13,1.47,3.86,2.61,0.9,1.01,0.64,1.6,0.59,0.35,0.2,0.57,7.2,2.02,0.68,2.22,1.95,0.64,9.96,8.47,1.05,15.73,2.98,7.09,6.19,0.53,0.59,0.48,0.18,0.02,0.04,1.23,0.22,0.33,0.29,0.2,0.15,16.37,5.31,5.09,0.02,0.13,0.24,0.07,0.02,1.01,3.27,0.35,0.86
f2el5s,It's been a year.,"Warning: this may be disturbing to some readers. Read at your own discretion. 

It's been a year since my first post here. A year to think about my life and try and improve myself and reconnect myself to friends and the things that I love to do. I have mentally improved because of the distance from my brother and seem to be facing a better future than I thought. 
By the way, thank you to u/KappaHaus for commenting on my first post. That meant a lot to me =)
Now, let me get into this. I won't be telling more of my story in detail because I can sum it up pretty quickly: my brother's abuse drove me to depression and near insanity, I lost friends, was a loner to start high school, and I lost my social skills quickly. But along the way, something more strange manifested itself at the beginning of my depression, so I wanted to get some input. Just kinda whatever you know is fine, you can ask questions, it's all good. I'm mostly just curious at this point, considering that I have made it through the pain and am pretty comfortable now. Got into a good college, am starting a new life... Blah blah blah 
That's not what I'm here to talk about. I'm here to talk about my time with (what I think to be) DID (or some other dissociative disorder). I've done a year of research and I've certainly accepted that this is likely what I have (or had??) but don't take my word for it as I have been too afraid to go to a professional. I'd rather my parents not think of me as a freak or something. But here goes nothing. 

Before I understood or knew what I had, I would (especially late at night) text friends that were close to me weird stuff. Mean things, horrible things and I would forget about it by the morning. Things like how I would murder someone or how I can't help but to feel violent sometimes. This was very unlike me because I was a very sweet and innocent person at the time (I still kinda am, but it's more of a teenage definition of innocent). I would then notice what was written, 'remember' that I had in fact written it, then apologize to my friend because that just wasn't like me at all. She got tired of this and left me. I also noticed that my dreams were really messed up: showing me ripping people apart and what not, but I knew it wasn't really me. The look on my face said that this person wasn't me, but something else. I also showed aggression towards my parents sometimes when my brother accused me of something that wasn't true. It made me kinda upset on the inside, but on the outside I became much more hostile than such a situation would call for. My first year of highschool, I decided to figure out what was up. By then, I had already regained my memories and I wasn't having much trouble in keeping them, even when these strong feelings of not being myself came on. I would come to have these dreams where I would just talk to people, not realizing that these were the said 'alters' I shared my brain with. Ace was the first, mean and abrasive. A lot more aggressive than me, but not really violent. Just your grade A asshole. Then Skye, who I remember as being the first because he didn't hide nearly as much as Ace. He was funny and draws really well. He's British, but has a good American accent so I often let him take my place at school. Then there was Caia. She seems pretty young and shy, a kid with a lot of curiosity and energy. After that, Reid. He's cocky, but very smart and is older than all of us except for Silas. I made Silas myself so that I could 'bottle up' all of the alters and have some peace. Zero is here too and he is very violent, but he doesn't care about too much so he isn't hard to convince to stay chill. He doesn't seem to care that I don't let him out ever. I also figured out that the shifts between these personalities are near seamless: as of to be a sudden urge to act a certain way for a while. I don't want to get rid of them because they listen to me and recently haven't caused issues. They also tend to give me advice that I wouldn't really think of. I more so want to hear what people have to say about this situation and whether or not I have DID and whether or not I should seek out help. I have no idea if I'm misplacing my diagnosis cause I'm not a doctor and because I don't really lose memories or black out anymore. Instead of switching on and off different personalities, I can see what they do and feel what they do while they're doing it, but they're in control. But, I definitely don't act like myself when they're in control. I talk differently, walk differently, like different foods or music more. For example, Caia always has energy, even when I don't and has the imagination of a 10 year old, liking to play with toys. Reid, on the other hand, has OCD and often cleans whenever he's in charge which I hate doing. It's all very confusing. 

However, right now I'm in a decent place and have been working on my overall health so that I can enjoy college and everything that comes after.

f2gw7p,Can childhood neglect lead to issues understanding your own thoughts?,"My parents were extremely emotionally neglectful and abusive. My mom in particular. Growing up, they had nothing to do with me emotionally, and i mean NOTHING, in fact, my mom would tell me that my issues didn't matter or that i was ""wrong"" about my feelings. i think this has severely emotionally stunted me. Now i know from research that emoitional neglect can lead to alexithymia (difficulty in understanding and identifying your feelings), but im wondering, can it also do that to your thinking as well? I ask because i have a severe problem with knowing what im thinking, its as if i have no thoughts at all, i cant identify any, like im a hollow shell.",Bacongod239,2020-02-11 15:03:37,6,127,10.41,9.04,99,1,18.14,26.77,90.55,60.63,24.41,18.11,14.96,0,2.36,0,0.79,6.3,1.57,12.6,12.6,3.94,7.87,3.94,18.11,3.94,3.15,0.79,0,1.57,7.87,0.79,7.09,0,0.79,2.36,7.09,2.36,0,1.57,0,24.41,11.81,2.36,2.36,3.15,3.94,3.94,1.57,0,0,1.57,0,0,0,0,0,5.51,0.79,1.57,2.36,0,2.36,3.15,14.17,0,7.87,2.36,3.94,1.57,2.36,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0,0,0,0.79,0,16.54,3.94,7.09,0,0,1.57,0,0,1.57,0.79,1.57,0
f2hlj4,Our long-term abuser pulled this sh#t last week?,"I'm starting to believe our abuser is either borderline narcissistic or sociopathic, basically last week my sister was out with our abuser and mother, he asked an inappropriate question which i believe was about getting money from someone dying or something, mother didn't want to talk about it but he kept being pushy, sister told him off, he gets pissed off going on a rant, she puts headsets on to ignore him, he pulls up around the corner out of view and turns around and hits her a few times, apparently he has to be right, obviously they have to stay out for the day and me pretending to be oblivious or content as to what happened when i was stuck in the flat with him, i can't say too much about him without him getting pissed off for another rant, anyway they ended up going home early because of him, he and my dad were trying to sugarcoat what happened saying it's because of brother back home where mother and sister come from, apparently from dad's words we all have to learn to get along, funny thing is our abuser who's been trying to make me or sister out to be a bad guy now is pretending as if he did nothing wrong having light rants that she was like this or i did that, and that singling and alienating people around him out that makes him feel like some kind of messed up hero or messiah or something, anyway thanks for reading this through, glad i finally decided to post this in spite of his behaviour of pretending to be good and righteous, maybe i'll get other things off my chest from the past too and talk about here, maybe he'll learn something, doubtful but who knows, thanks for letting me rant here anyway guys.",GreatJustinTheDarkNi,2020-02-11 15:51:24,0,316,44.8,74.7,55.53,5.51,158,14.24,93.35,60.44,19.62,12.34,4.11,1.58,0,6.01,0.63,7.28,2.53,18.67,7.59,7.59,7.91,1.27,20.57,2.85,1.58,2.22,0,1.9,5.7,1.9,3.8,0.32,2.53,0,15.82,3.16,0.63,3.16,6.96,15.19,3.48,1.27,0.63,7.28,0.95,4.75,1.58,0.63,0.63,0.32,0.95,0.95,0,0,0,7.91,3.16,0.63,1.27,1.9,0.95,5.7,11.71,1.27,16.14,2.85,8.86,4.75,0.63,0,0.63,0.32,0,0.32,1.58,0.63,0,0,0,0.95,10.44,0.32,6.65,0,0,0.32,0,0.32,0,2.53,0,0.32

f2jeih,Abuse and being uncomfortable with love or affection,"My girlfriend was neglected and abused at home, and bullied and friendless at school, all throughout her childhood and teenage years. She says that she's not comfortable with affection because it's so foreign to her, and that she prefers being abused and degraded because it's familiar to her. Is this a common way to feel for people with childhoods like hers?

I really do love her and think she's a beautiful person though. I'm friends with an ex of hers, so he gives me advice on how to handle her. She's VERY brittle. One time he tried raising her self-esteem by telling her all the good he saw in her and going on a long monologue about how wonderful she was, and she locked herself in her room and started cutting her arms and legs and stomach while screaming deranged stuff like ""YOU AREN'T WORTH LOVING, YOU AREN'T WORTH LOVING, HE'S LYING TO YOU!""

f2o600,Abuse? Im starting to think so. (rant) TW: possible Sexual Abuse of a minor.,"In all my 18 years ive never really told anybody about this because ive never been sure if it was abuse. So i thought id come here and just... let it out for once. I apologise in advanve if i shouldnt be posting this here. The only one who knows is my gf and she doesnt know details- just a dumbed down one sentence version of it bc i didnt want to make her sad. At the time this occured i definetly didnt like it, i was scared, i was angry, i was ashamed and embarrassed, but i didnt think it was genuine abuse. Theres no evidence anyways so its not like i couldve done something.  My mother touched me under the guise of ""checking for dirtiness"".  Up until i was 14 and a high school freshman, she would constantly barge into the bathroom whilst im in there. Even on the toilet. But mostly when i shower. I told her time and time again to get out. I screamed and cried but she wouldnt. She even leaves the bathroom door open. My father or my younger brother couldve came past and seen me. When im in the shower shed bust in and demand to wash me and wash my hair (very long hair, down to my ass). Shed always complain that i didnt wash my hair right if i did it on my own. That its greasy or will get lice or has soap in it. It got to the point that i gave up and reluctantly called her to wash my hair when i go shower. And every time id go to shave my legs she had to be the one to apply nair creme on me and wait 10 minutes then wash it off. Then after showers, shed take me to her room and with the door wide open, and my father often present, shed force me to lay on her bed with my legs spread and shed poke and prod my genitals. Shed spread my labia and look very close. Shed comment that shes checking for dirtiness or that shes concerned that im very pink (?) And just keep messing around while my father watched. If i struggled or complained or cried my father would scream at me to let her do what she needs to do.    Theres other slightly creepy things i remember. My father when i was little would stand me naked on top of fhe toilet lid to blowdry my hair then smack my ass when hes done. Hed also shower with me, and sometimes my brother too when were little, and mess around with his genitalia either with his hands or by changing the water preassure and spraying it. and even let my brother poke it.  And even to this day, if i try to leave the bathroom after a shower to go to my room and change, if someones in the hallway i tell them to leave so i can go through without being seen but he calls me rediculous and says that i shouldnt be weird about being seen in a towel and at one point even demanded that i leave the bathroom in a towel whilst he was waiting at the door to see me. Its just... creepy how persistent he is to see my body.    Nowadays any random thing would bring back these memories and suddenly i start panicking and closing my legs tight subconciously. Its like... a flashback, if thats the right term. Sometimes i remember these things when my parents touch me (even a slight touch like brushing past me in the hallway). Sometimes i see old pics and remember. Sometimes i see a long haired girl and remember. Sometimes im showering and i remember.  Sometimes i just think about sex, normal 19 year old stuff, and i remember and im just not in the mood anymore and feel repulsed. It just keeps popping up again at random times and i feel like throwing up. It keeps affecting me, and its always affected me. I cant even stand to wear shorts or a tank top or no bra around my parents. When i was little, i always wet myself in class or at daycare because i was so so afraid to go to the bathroom bc i thought somebody might come with me or somebody might open the door and expose me. I still feel uncomfortable in public restrooms because i think someone will look through the gaps or the shitty doors will accidentally unlock and expose me. It just keeps affecting me. Whether this is considered abuse or not, its fucked me up.  Im pretty sure some creepy abusive shit was going on. But unfortunately,  theres no evidence and i still live with them.  Fortunately that kind of abuse stopped,.. but i still have to deal with other forms of abuse. 

Also sorry for any typos or other mistakes. Its 330am and im pretty fuckin distraught at the moment.",BigAssGothBf,2020-02-12 00:30:04,7,845,15.52,8.5,97.02,1,15.09,14.08,89.82,60,21.18,14.79,12.19,0,0,2.37,0.24,6.39,3.91,11.72,8.4,7.57,11.48,2.13,17.87,2.72,1.3,1.42,1.07,0.71,4.85,0.59,4.02,1.07,1.54,0.47,6.39,1.3,0.12,1.78,1.66,14.79,2.6,1.54,2.25,5.56,1.07,5.09,2.96,1.3,0.36,1.18,2.84,1.54,0.71,0.83,0.12,3.91,0.71,0.47,2.25,0.47,0.24,5.44,9.94,1.07,17.04,2.01,7.81,7.34,0.36,0.59,2.37,0,0,0,1.18,0.71,0.36,0,0,0.12,11.36,7.22,2.49,0.12,0,0.24,0,0.12,0.24,0,0.95,0

f2ttlt,I've suffered from child abuse (and kinda still am) but I don't know what to do,"I've been going through this rough time recently dealing with alot of traumas and now I'm moving on to this part of my trauma. I'm almost 16 and I've been through more things than a 15 year old should. But right now let's focus on child abuse. When I was living with my mom I was abused everyday and she even knocked in teeth, she almost killed me 4 times and I remember her trying to drown me. So that's a start because that all ended when I was 4. But ever since as you would assume I've been having PTSD and panic attacks about it and when people get angry at me and yell I get scared and cry. I'm currently living with my father and our living condition isn't great, he is always at work and stressed and I'm the one who has to manage my other 2 siblings, one of which is older than me. I've lived with my father ever since I got away from my mom andi always looked up to him as if he was a savior. Except for he isn't. Even if he is better than my mother that doesn't make him a ""good person"". Throughout my many years he has also abused me, not to the extent of my mother but he still did it. He grabbed us by the neck and slammed us against the wall while yelling in our faces and that didn't help with my anything. He used to punch me and slap me. But here's my problem. I don't know how to get away from this, I'm afraid of him, I'll get that out there. My dad terrifies me and I only act like his son around him because I'm scared. He hasn't really abused me for a while and the last time he was physical was 3 months ago when he got mad at me for sleeping in and instead of waking me up he just punched my arm really hard while yelling and getting mad while telling me how useless I am. Recently it's been more emotional abuse by just saying very hurtful things and makes fun of my appearance (I'm very skinny mostly because I haven't been fed properly pretty much ever) 
Anyways I just don't know what to do and I'm scared, I wanna leave this house but I don't know if that's enough to be able to leave.

f2udas,Abusive Ex Found my Apartment,"So, I left my abusive ex for the like, 7th time, because I found out he was cheating on me, and I guess he's just become so used to the process of reeling me back in and how it works, that he was able to track down my apartment (and by track down, I mean, that for the, like 7th time someone I trusted divulged my information to him after promising me they wouldn't; I even told them that he was abusive to me, which obviously means nothing to anyone). He just showed up last Friday and completely derailed any prior sense of safety I had. I was just getting to the point where things were getting better; the PTSD was finally starting to slow down a bit, but now it's back full force. Most of the times I've gotten back with him have been for the very reason that I felt as though I can't get away from him. I had a restraining order against him before, and that entire process was agonizing and something I no longer have time to deal with. I let him know I'd call the cops next time he shows up, but now he knows where I live, so he can still hang around the area if he wants to. Like, I am literally infuriated to the point where I'm having a hard time dealing with the anger. I had enough anger from just dealing with him, and now this. I'm thinking maybe I should just leave the state. I don't even know. I don't even know how I would do that. I'm tied to my college plan here, and don't have that much education to just cut it off. I'm failing anyways because of all this (or, well, just completely traumatized to the point where I can barely work, much less go to school). Therapy makes things worse. I have trauma from previous therapists and family counseling nightmares. I'm so self-absorbed and wish I could help others, but I'm so incompetent that I'm basically useless. I feel like I'm in hell, quietly bound while I endure mountains of mental and emotional torture on a daily basis. 

I hope this gets removed, because all the mods hate me, but I just don't know what else to do with all this pain. There's no where for it to go.

f319my,my best friend abused me.,"This is my first time posting here; I’m usually more of a lurker. I’ve been wanting to tell more people about my story for a long time. Maybe it’ll help me process it more by getting it out there. I’ll probably get scared and delete it soon. I’m not even sure it’s bad enough to count as abuse because I got so used to it; the abuse mostly happened from when i was 12-13 and she was my best friend. It feels like it was my fault. 

So here it is, my side of the story (please excuse the weird way it’s written, it’s written that way because it was the easiest way for me get it all into one place). 

I have changed the names of my abuser and the real people in this story but not the made up people. 

This is what I remember that Gemma did to me but my memories are fragmented and blurred as I did my best to block everything out and I deleted everything from the time because it disturbed me so much.
Be sure to remember that this is everything I remember from Gemma manipulating me personally.

In the summer holidays before year 8, when I was 12, Gemma introduced me to her group of primary school friends, who you will later learn are all made up. She introduced me to Ellie May Jane, Chloe Brookes, Alyssa Scarlett and Tyler Smith who was then going by Danielle. They seemed nice and we talked sometimes.

Around half term of year 8 in 2016, Gemma was saying that Alice was being mean to her and ignoring her or something. I can’t remember the reason. I don’t think Gemma said it to me directly, it was the group of friends from her primary. They said Gemma wanted to leave [insert my secondary school] ‘because of Alice’ or something. I don’t remember it very clearly.

Gemmas’s friends all apparently went to apart from Alyssa. Chloe, Ellie and Tyler went to [another secondary school in my city]. They said Gemma wanted to leave as previously mentioned. I was scared of losing Gemma and they (the group) were all slagging Alice off and I followed suit because I didn’t know what to do and I was scared. I can remember the first night I found out; I was crying uncontrollably and having a panic attack. The next day Gemma didn’t acknowledge any of the events that happened at school and I found that so strange but I didn’t bring it up or question it. 

Apparently Gemma had a place at [the other secondary school] ready for her and was all ready to move. All of this was a secret to everybody but me but I didn’t share any of it because I was scared. I later learned from talking to my school that none of this school transfer business happened. 

Then Ellie apparently got cancer- osteosarcoma and got bullied for it at school ie for losing hair. I found pictures of ‘Ellie’ on a girl named Jessica’s account, who Tyler followed. I asked Gemma about it and she said that Jessica was someone who bullied Ellie for her cancer. A lie.

Apparently Ellie was Gemma’s childhood best friend and they dated for a while.

Then Tyler became evil for some reason and had his group of people who I called minions. Apparently they were beating Gemma up. At some point Tyler moved to America but I can’t remember when.

Then Chloe got cancer too- rhabdomyosarcoma. A girl named Alicia came into the picture and befriended Gemma. She was a friend of Chloe, Ellie and Tyler’s from [the other secondary school]. I think she was a ploy to get Gemma to go to [the other secondary school] or something. I don’t think she’s real and my suspicions were confirmed recently when I learned that this entire group of people were made up when I spoke to people I knew from [the other secondary school]. Alicia apparently got raped and stabbed. 

Ellie “died” from her cancer on December 8th following a party. They found diet pills or something with her. But Ellie didn’t really die as she then turned up mysteriously alive and well a few months later. I tried getting answers but no one would tell me anything. I remember feeling so confused. That group of people seemed almost invincible in a way. 

I remember something like Tyler’s minions making Gemma eat sandwiches with diet pills in or something along those lines.

Then it was the end of term and the Christmas holidays. Gemma hit her head and was in hospital for a while. Apparently she nearly died; this is what Chloe, Tyler and Alyssa were saying. Gemma met her internet friend Charlotte in hospital or something, I’m not sure how that works.
Tyler became not evil or something and flew from America to see Gemma in hospital. That really confused me.

Skip to easter of year 8 (2017). I went to China and at this time, the things going on with Alice and Gemma were still occuring. By this time Ellie was alive and well for some reason and there was this group chat with Gemma’s primary school friends + Charlotte. Ellie was especially indirecting me on the group chat with something like “how can you associate with someone who made your best friend self harm?”. Needless to say I was scared and confused. I didn’t know what was happening. 

I can only remember fragments of this because it was a long time ago and I’ve blocked most of it out and tried to forget it all. 

I think all of this was some sort of manipulation tactic to make Gemma feel powerful and ensure that I stayed with her.

I’m really unsure as to what is real and what isn’t because of her constant gaslighting. 
Not gonna lie I’m literally scared of her and what she’s capable of.
I was essentially her trial run for abusing people because she abused others in an even worse way than she did me afterwards. After she manipulated me, she changed the stories slightly so they were more believable and so the people were always just out of reach and kept me further from the gist of things after.

It’s so scary how she managed to make all these people up. They all talked and texted like real people but looking back, they all had the same tone, same interests, same personality, same empty instagram profile; I can’t believe I didn’t pick up on it earlier.  

I still can’t process what happened even almost 3 years later because it was prolonged abuse and also I feel so silly for letting it get to me so much; I think in a way I blame myself for not realising it earlier. I only broke contact with my abuser in early January 2020 and I still see her in school every single day. And the school have basically done absolutely nothing to support the victims of her abuse; the most repercussions she got was 4 days of suspension while her victims were left with a lot of trauma to process don’t we just love that. I hate seeing her at school every single day.

f32ume,My abusive grandmother is in the hospital,"My grandmother, who my dad and my aunt my cousin and I lived with for years, my dad and my husband and I still do is narcissistic, emotionally abusive and has always been ""poor me"" in any situation. If we did something by accident like break something she'd blame us. Never let us feel welcomed in the house like she would turn the TV off in the living room if we were watching it, turn hers up extremely loud and leave her door open on purpose. Turn the living room light off on us. Always blame us for high water bill even though the water company has said it's just going up to cover costs of the water plant etc. Nothing is ever her fault. It's always ours. 

I have anxiety attacks being near her (I avoid her as much as possible by scheduling my day around her work schedule I can't work). 
When I was mourning my cat when I was a teenager I laid on the couch and she yelled at my dad about my feet being on it. I obviously had a shitty childhood and now realize I had depression and that cat was my anchor was my best friend. I barely remember the few months after my cats death I was in such a dark place. She has 0 empathy to me. 

Yet she spoils my other cousins from my second aunt. Doesn't be controlling to them. Of course they also don't live with her.

And this old woman that has made me feel like utter shit is in the hospital from a possible stroke and possibly dieing and I don't know how to feel. I'm with my husband visiting his family in another state, and when I got the text from my dad that she may have had a stroke I made a joke about her dieing and now it seems to be true. I don't know if I feel bad. I feel anger and sadness. Anger that she wasn't the grandma other people have, a grandma that loves and understands and sadness that I never had that. I don't even know if I'm sad about her possibly dieing just for the sake she's family. 

And if she doesn't die but ends up disabled is she going to be worse? I won't be able to escape her. We need her for financial support like paying bills because the shitty jobs in our area are shit. I just don't know what to think or feel or how to process this.

And just got an update she's starting to respond to meds but no idea if she's going to be ok.

Anyone with similar experience?",Destany89,2020-02-12 18:33:10,0,455,17.04,46.48,63.54,1,16.25,11.87,94.95,61.98,22.42,17.58,9.89,1.98,0,5.27,0.44,4.84,4.84,12.53,11.65,5.93,8.57,3.08,20.44,2.42,2.2,1.54,0.44,0.88,6.59,1.54,5.05,0.44,2.64,1.1,14.29,3.52,0.22,6.59,1.54,13.19,3.52,1.54,1.76,4.18,2.2,3.3,3.3,0.66,0.66,1.76,3.74,1.1,1.76,0,0.66,8.57,4.18,1.1,1.98,0.66,1.1,4.84,13.85,1.1,13.41,1.98,5.93,5.27,1.98,0.88,1.54,1.32,0,0.66,1.1,0.88,0,0.22,0,0,12.09,5.49,1.32,0,0,0.44,0,0,0.44,3.96,0.44,0
f35pxr,Are my parents abusing me?,"So I have always been wondering if my parents are abusing me. Born in a Korean family, I've experienced physical punishments, mental punishments and emotional punishments. When I was maybe 10-11? I once got a big bruise on my eye 2 days after it was my birthday for playing games up late and waiting for my birthday present. My mom hit my head on the bathroom counter. After that, they gave my birthday present on Christmas and said that was my birthday and Christmas present. As I have grown into a teenager now, they start putting hard work on me, my mom saying she had to provide and cook food for his younger brother when they were young since their mother was always working. But then again, they tell me me and them are not the same. They say if I don't do the dishes and other house work, I will get punished. They did say they won't physically punish me anymore since I'm a teenager but still, emotional and mental punishment hurts as well. My mom gets so mad she starts shouting at me and throwing things if I don't do the dishes and once she got mad I accidentally put a type of sauce in her ramen that she usually loves to put into it. She told me from work she was going to come home and if I could cook her some ramen and she did say don't put the sauce in in Korean but my Korean wasn't perfect, since I was born and raised in a different country and I didn't understand what the word meant. She later came home smelling the sauce and started shouting at me, saying how she has to work right after this and threw away the soup and threw stuff around. I later had to clean it up. Also, she sometimes embarrasses me in front of visitors or when we visit someone and I never have the confidence after to tell her that I didn't like it. I could go on and on about what my mom has done but I also want to mention this. Now I am not your typical skinny guy who has a slim body and so I wanted to diet once. She did help me through a few days but then when she cooked ramen for dinner, I said I wanted more healthy food. She got so fed up with that and how I just gave up and took my ramen into my room that she basically kicked me out of the house. I had no shoes to wear so I walked bare feet to my grandma's house and had dinner there. That day, I expressed all my feelings to my grandma. 

My dad, he is basically always blaming me and my sister. We always put bottles of water in the fridge and me and my sister sometimes take the cold water there, but so does my mom and dad. He says you should replace the water you guys drank and put it in the fridge. It's so frustrating that he always blames us. He also blames us when dishes are there after I finish school, saying that me and my sister used all the plates and that we should do the dishes. He also once threw my computer onto the ground, saying I play too many games and started physically hurting me. Now again with my dad, I can go on and on about what he did but there's this one time when my dad came back from the party and I was going to sleep in the living room because I think my room was bug infested after seeing a bunch of bugs and so he got ready into his pajamas and he asked what I was doing here. I told him my room might be bug infested. Now my dad, he doesn't sleep with my mother in their room and he sleeps in the living room. He told me to get off and go sleep in my room and I kept declining going back to my room and he just responded with a ""wow, your so rude"". I DON'T UNDERSTAND! I ended up sleeping in my sister's room. But honestly, my dad might be better in less punishment than my mom but my mom is better in understanding me somtimes than my dad. 

I decided to write these paragraphs after I just got punished for not doing the dishes after my mom came back from work. She asked why I didn't do the dishes and said if I wanted my pocket money, you have to work. She promised me to give me 20 dollars a week and she hasn't paid me for 3 weeks.... She got mad and told me ""If your not doing the dishes, I'm not gonna provide your dinner either and you can go work"". This is not the first time she had said this to me. I ended up doing the dishes and she was cooking in the kitchen and I was angry and frustrated I started putting the dishes on the rack hardly and she said in an angry tone, ""PUT IT GENTLY"". I feel like I can't even be a human in my house cause I can't even be angry. She kept giving me an eye every time I put it hardly. I couldn't hold back the tears of fear and helplessness. 

Now guys, my parents are mostly nice. They raised me and all and we sometimes do fun stuff together. They don't abuse me extremely like starving me or something, it's just I feel like they sometimes take stuff too far. I really think Korean parental is wrong by punishing them harshly and I've once mentioned that to my mom. I just wish they can understand me a bit more and I can maybe understand them a bit more too. They work really hard and my mom doesn't come home until 7pm sometimes because she's working, along with my dad. For the people who might be going through something similar, I just hope now after you read about my story, you don't feel alone and you can maybe stand up in wrong situations like the ones I mentioned. I've been wanting to open up these problems so thank you for reading.",Mochimochiuwu,2020-02-12 22:24:45,10,1061,15.67,45.5,89.02,8.75,20.4,11.5,95.85,60.89,23.37,19.42,12.25,0.57,1.13,3.86,1.6,3.96,4.43,11.03,8.77,6.6,9.43,2.36,19.42,5.09,2.83,1.41,1.13,1.41,5.37,1.98,3.39,0.19,2.26,0.47,15.27,3.02,0.28,4.15,2.54,10.08,1.32,0.94,1.79,2.73,1.32,3.49,2.73,0.28,1.41,0.85,4.62,1.13,0.57,0,2.92,6.88,2.07,1.32,2.17,1.51,0.28,7.07,10.37,1.32,16.97,2.83,6.41,8.11,1.32,1.23,1.98,0.28,0.19,0,0.19,0,0.09,0,0.09,0,11.31,4.9,2.73,0,0,0.19,0.09,0.09,0.57,2.73,0,0

f36cjk,Everyone is calling ME the crazy one…,"Everyone is calling ME the crazy one… 

Dropping this here because I don’t know where else to go with it. I’m in a bizarre situation involving a “room mate” whom I suspect to be a professional grifter/con. I encourage questions because frankly there’s so much detail, I need to get the gist of it out.

About 5 years ago I broke up with my girlfriend and looking for a new start, moved to Indiana to be closer to my half sister. Her mother was renting a house out, and I needed a place to stay. My sister recommended an ex lover of hers as a roommate since he just got out of the hospital and needed a place to stay as well. I was advised from the start that he was intelligent and I “might just learn a thing or two” from him.

Things started off pretty casual. He had no job and I had to find a job so the first few months of living together, we struggled but got enough cash to get by and get the bills paid. There were little things here that I didn’t really notice at first such as his insistence that I put all the bills in my name, his severe lack of boundaries like smoking in the house, taking my car keys to use my car after only asking a single time for permission, and an incident in October of 2013 where his ex was pushing his phone number off her bill. He stated he didn’t have cash or an ID to get his own plan so we pushed it onto mine as long as he paid me for it (to this day I’ve never seen a dime).

Eventually we had to vacate the property because my sisters mother wanted the house back. This meant I had to find a new place so I searched for and found an apartment. Around this time I told him that he needed to contribute so he mentioned he had a client that he used to consult for that was still in need of services (IT Consulting for a construction company). He said he didn’t have the energy for it anymore so he’d pass the client on to me so long as he could work a few hours here and there to cover expenses. No problem. I did it proper, registered my own company with the state, opened the business bank account, and got everything in order to start taking the client. I’d bill by the hour, if he came along I’d bill for his time there too, and then at the end of the month I’d invoice and pay him out based on his hours worked. This system has never changed. However he never worked enough to cover his share so I would end up paying for most of the rent and utilities. I was also at this time working for both amazon and Apple in different capacities so I had 3 jobs.

After about a year and a half in the new apartment my girlfriend and I get back together. She moves in with us. At this point, he stops paying anything at all. When I would bring it up to him I’d immediately get push back and aggression about how he gave me the client and taught me how to open the business, etc. I’m non confrontational and I’d back down which I acknowledge was my fault. This scenario carries until my girl and I decide we want to move back to Detroit. He has nowhere to go, he’s currently driving my vehicle as he pleases and he has no money of his own. I decide, based on some suggestions from him, to purchase a house in Detroit and rehab as an investment. By the time my lease was up in Indiana, I’m still sorting the house so I decide I’ll stay with her in an apartment she got while I get that in order. He states that he’ll follow and “sleep in the jeep” until the house is bought and then he’ll assist with rehab. I feel bad about his lack of place to go, so I agree. We get to Detroit and he immediately attempts to drop guilt on my girl, stating “you said we could stay in the apartment until the house was bought”. Never stated. She recognized his BS and put her foot down. He commences sleeping in the jeep. My girl gets him an hourly gig at a restaurant. He continues to work and live in the jeep until I finally close on my house. This is where it gets dangerous.

On October 27th of 2017 I close on the house and agree to let him stay there as a room mate again. He begins renovating the house despite me telling him not to, doing little things like painting and sanding. 5 days in, I send him an email while I’m working from home at my girls apartment and tell him I need to him give me back my vehicle, he needs to pay rent, and he needs to stop working on my house. I go over to the house after work and he’s sleeping on a cot in the bathroom (house is steam radiators, bathroom is warmest place in the house). He says we need to talk. I sit down and he immediately pulls a gun, racks it so I see a round fly out and points it at my head saying, “You’ve stolen everything from me and left me on the side of the road to die. Its taking everything I have to not blow your brains out.” He then points the gun at himself, then at the ceiling and fires off a round. The bullet hole is still there to this day.

Call it gullibility, call it manipulation, but with that gun in his hand, he convinced me that I embezzled from a company that he was a part of because I spent freely from my business account, that I owed him money(“28k, 38k, 50k, whatever the F he says I owe him”), and that I was in deep. Over the course of the next 2ish years up to last December, he slept on my couch next to my front door with that gun. I payed everything, including paying my house off, all the bills, his phone bill still, and a pack of newport red shorts, dr pepper, and 5-10$ in cash for weed everyday for him. He didn’t work. He’d try to get me to get govt contracting gigs with the cage code I’d obtained for my business and he’s set arbitrary deadlines. If I wouldn;’t meet them or give him what he’d want, he’d tuck the gun in his waistband and start shoving me, hitting me or slapping me. e threatened to take me to court for embezzlement. He threatened to have my girlfriend pulled from a car, beaten and raped (I’d seen him have a girl hurt before, details pending if anyone cares). He said my lack of finding business for “us” was killing him.

During the last year I lost my job at Apple. I started to run out of money. I couldn’t afford his daily vices. I left one night to see my girlfriend I hadn’t seen in 3.5 weeks. He would isolate me from her as well as family and friends. He blamed her for the money I spent he felt he was entitled to. He hated her. I came back home and he lost his cool. Started screaming at me about how I’m worthless, am not focused etc etc. I was fed up. I told him Im done, we need to part ways and I grabbed my bag and left to get out of the house for the night. I came back the next night and this is where it gets weird. The police report I made is exactly what follows.

I walked in and he was awake, fully clothed on the couch staring at the computer monitor. I could tell by the look in his eyes, he was in one of the usual moods where he starts hitting me. I went upstairs, showered, and went to my room where he had tossed everything like he was looking for something. Within about 2 minutes I heard him coming up the stairs and I turned to see him adjusting his shirt like he tucked the gun in his back waistband again. Without a single word, he shoved me and started yelling, “I SAID GIVE ME 24 HOURS”. He shoved me several times and eventually forced me out of the house. Over the next 5 days I got nonstop threats about what would happen if I contacted the police and he demanded I sign over my business, my house, and my vehicle. The texts he sent included him talking in the narrative as if I had indeed been drunk and attacked him in his sleep. He refused me any of my possessions unless I did so and continued threats of violence and law suits/jail time unless I signed a document. The document stated that I came in drunk ( I don’t drink) the night of the last assault, acted crazy and then I was removed by him because I was irrational. I foolishly in fear, signed it. Eventually I filed a police report and had to have cops escort me over to get my stuff.

After speaking to several people, I showed all my evidence to the police and got an ex parte ppo granted. I got him served. He immediately filed a motion to drop it, and then filed to have one against me stating I filed a false report, attacked him in his sleep twice while drunk, and that I was interfering with his business. I called the cops twice to get him removed from my home as per the ppo and get some stuff he was holding of mine back. Each time the cops came, they threatened to arrest me because they stated they can’t “remove him from his home”. Eventually after speaking with a sgt at the police station and showing him he’s violating the ppo, he called this man and told him he had an hour to vacate (this seemed unconventional and strange to me). He left and I got back in my house. We had a show cause hearing and he got found in contempt and had to pay a 500$ bond. We have another hearing in a month and Im being told that because of the paper I signed, which contradicts the police report I filed, my ppo will likely be dropped and his granted against me.

Sorry for the length. I feel scared, angry, used……this guy has turned my life upside down and all I can think is that I’ve been heavily manipulated and now it feels like he’s winning. He’s made several other strange moves against me and whenever I report the things he’s done, all people keep telling me is that my story sounds like bs. When I first moved in with him 5 years ago he said when he was in the hospital his roommates took all his stuff and kicked him out. He’s saying I’m doing the same thing……this can’t be coincidence right?",Ferret-like-focus,2020-02-12 23:24:37,0,1899,51.93,58.74,47.97,7.88,19.58,13.01,91.1,58.66,22.22,17.9,9.37,0.63,0.16,7.53,0.21,4.32,6.74,14.96,6.53,4.53,7.53,1.16,17.48,2.95,1.58,1.05,1.47,1.26,3.42,0.9,2.42,0.53,1.05,0.37,13.8,0.32,0.58,1.11,7.16,7.32,1.26,1.21,1.58,1.16,1.21,1.74,2.47,1,1,0.58,1.63,0.74,0.42,0.11,0.37,7.37,1.63,1,2.69,1.74,0.79,7.06,7.9,0.9,17.43,2.9,8.53,6.74,3.21,0.47,2.37,2.58,0,0.11,0.58,0.11,0.11,0.21,0.11,0,13.32,5.32,3.69,0,0.05,0.05,0,0.05,0.95,2.26,0.74,0.21
f37d3d,Worried about my siblings and my future,"I don’t know if this fits the sub since I’m 21 now and not living with my parents, but I don’t know where else I can talk about it.
My parents always told me I was dumb and unladylike my entire life. In 3rd grade, my teacher started bringing lunches to school for me and it was the first time that I realized that it was unusual for kids to not eat during the day. I was responsible for my sister that was 4 years younger, and I made sure that she ate when I didn’t. When I was 11, my dad touched me for the first time. He put a camera in my bedroom and I finally broke it when I was 13. My dad took me out of school when I was 15. Every year my mom told me that I’d be able to go back, so I tried out for the HS swim team every year and made varsity every time, but I wasn’t ever allowed to go back because my dad said he was afraid of getting caught. When I turned 18, I finally got my first job against their will. I paid for the GED and the SAT, and they told me I would fail each time, but I got way higher than average scores. I got myself into college on a government assistance program, but I dropped out recently due to my depression and anxiety. I worry that my current boyfriend is abusive since he hurts me occasionally and hides my things. I worry that I’m repeating the past, but I have nowhere else to go and this is the best I’ve had it in a long time. I eat most days, and I don’t have to do much for it. I’m worried about my future and I don’t know what to do. I also worry about my sisters, one older and one younger. I just thought about myself when I was a kid, but my little sister is 17 and still lives with them. My older sister wet the bed until she was 13, and was underweight, both signs in abused children. My younger sister doesn’t show any signs of abuse, but she’s currently in that house and I’m worried that things are bad for her since none of us are close.

Does anyone have any advice about any of this?

f37z89,Whatever the duck.,"I've fucked up my life. So, more than a year ago I was in a different town, I had a job, friends, walked every day for hour and a half, when all of a sudden I started being startled every time I would go to my favorite location. There was this car that was always there when I was and he would turn on his lights in my direction. He wouldn't talk to me, but he acknowledged my presence. I've been reading this one sub when the messages started. He wrote ""how come we always get here at the same time"". I thought that I was just paranoid because seriously, who would stalk me? Why would someone do that? lol 
He started writing messages in which I've mistaken him for someone I know and responded - error #1. Months later, I'm in a different town and I start seeing messages about what I'm doing, I go for a smoke every night at 11pm and every night I hear someone there, just standing, all alone, startling me. In October, I go in an anonymous chat room and talk to a guy who seems familiar and I write in the sub how I've recognized him. I now realize that *that* guy was my stalker and not someone who I've known and who was also writing there. He'd told me that he loved me and I thought maybe it's my ex messing with me or something. The stalking continued. I should never have entered that chat room. The guy is delusional and he thinks I know him even though I don't and the chatroom was anonymous. He actually thinks I like him. I've seen him maybe 3 times in my life as far as I can remember. One time was when I exited public transport and went home while he at the same time exited the nearby cafe and went to another one to drink with his buddies, and the cafe is near my house. He knew my routine.
The second time was when I went to a cafe with my friend and he came in 5min afterward. He looked at me as if he knew me, while I've recognized his face from the previous encounter. 
The third time was last week when I went on a bus and, again, he was walking in front of me and started speed walking. He wrote me a message in a sub that he ran from me because I don't want him. What the actual fuck? Let me be clear - the only reason I'd been responding there was to tell him to leave me alone. Which is also a mistake because I should've went no contact. 
He probably drinks a lot, he mentioned that, and he has some issues.
Right now I am on NC but I still worry that he won't leave me alone. I'm not sure about the first part, the car, if that was him, this is all too much for me to believe in. It's not real. It cannot be. I don't have any evidence because I didn't know what was going on and it's anonymous so I didn't screen anything. I can't believe I'm writing this. I can't believe this is my life. All of this seems like a dream, a nightmare, not real. You see this in a movie but you never would have though that it would happen to you. 
Fuck. That reminds me of when I was in a bus and this guy on a motorcycle was staring at me. I wonder whether that was him. That's it. I'm going paranoid.
He told me his name and age in the chatroom, though I don't know if that info was real. I know some little things about him but I still don't know who he is not what he's doing here. 
I don't know where else to post this shit.

f3c39c,My Dad,"My dad when i was younger would loose it and push me off the steps and just do little stuff like that which no one notice. Then it progressed every now and then he would loose it and grab me or drag me by my ankles which still wasn't that bad. Once he kicked me because i wanted another drink. Once i was a teen he stopped for a while. He still would intimidate me sometimes and scream in my face and tower over me but didn't hit me or anything any more.

A few months ago i was making a cup of tea, i think he had been drinking he came into the kitchen screaming at me for no apparent reason he backed me into a corner by pushing me. Then he grabbed me dragged me across the room. Then his hand was round my neck pushing me back, he threw me into the next room and i landed on the floor.

He blamed me. He blamed ME for what he did. I now live away from home for college. He dropped a surprise visit yesterday and took me out for dinner seeing him just brings everything back. He went to hug me and i just feel his hand on my neck and i just want to cry and scream and push him away.

f3cbu8,Is this abuse or am i just a bad person,"my first post here so im going to keep it as short as possible
so this story began when my mom found my weed at my pockets, i was 15 at the time now im 17, i sat down with her and tried to explain why i smoked weed, she didnt seem to care at all, i was a grade A+ student, had a job and didnt ask them for clothes or food ever since i was 15 and started smoking, i was always polite to them and i still am, but the problem is that they(my parents and big brother) see me as a hirrendous person who doesnt love anyone because i smoke weed, the abuse came in 1 year ago when thing s started to get big, i was beaten up daily physically, mentally, and emotionally, everytime im around them now i feel bad about myself, everytime im out with my friends they chase me around the city, take pics of me hanging out, make jokes about me and treat me like a piece of shit, but 6 months ago, they even started to pick me up wherever i might be besides home, bring me back home and start to fight me, i always manage to fight back and have my back but 1 againts three seems too much and they always leave me with bruises on my face, cauliflower ears and bruises all over my body, evertime after they fight me i ask myself this question ""AM I THE BAD PERSON"",
i didnt have the courage to tell people neither post here but today after i finished school my brother saw me going home, stopped right in front of me with his car, beat me up and put me in the car, by the time we were home i already had bruises but that didnt stop since he came out of the car and we started fighting again, left me with a cauliflower and a black eye and went on with his day, 30 mins after we fought i had to go to my job and im already here with all the bruises and feeling very ill right now and the sadness within me is getting bigger and bigger.

f3err9,have you ever been mentally or psychically abused by someone but they put the blame on you and they put bad ideas of you in peoples heads? so everyone thinks your bad??,"My question is have you ever been in a relationship or friendship or dealt with family that was abusive towards you (emotionally and psychically) and made you look like the bad ones when in fact you was the victim of there abuse? Every time you thought you was doing something right you made the situation worse for yourself and it made you look more like the abuser instead of the victim?Everywhere you turn trying to seek help you was setting yourself up for more problems by not knowing the people you was talking to as confidants was the friends of the abuser and they manipulated everything and made it worse? No one believes you because the abuser already planted bad ideas of you in other peoples heads ? The proof you showed to people they would ignore? You hoping that someone out there will finally see the truth. You hoping someone out there will finally help you and know what’s right from wrong? Have you ever got so tired that you started to see yourself as the bad one and you start to believe that you are bad like everyone was thinking ? Have you ever been so tired of trying to prove your innocence that you rather be in peace and accept the fact that everyone thinks you where the abuser? have you ever felt like you was going crazy because that incident messed with your mind and way of thinking? has this incident caused you to want to be alone and not deal with people anymore? has this incident changed your way of thinking and when a new problem is on the horizon your not sure if you should speak up because in your head you are still dealing with what happened to you in the past and you still feel as if you are a bad person? the past still haunts your present in unwanted memories and flash backs and sometimes you break down and cry? you explain your story to a therapist but it don't make you feel better because they don't understand the pain you went through and still are struggling with? do you feel like the whole world is a bad place and no one cant be trusted so you find ways to isolate yourself from friendships,love and the outside world? have you ever felt like god was judging you and wasn't on your side? has this incident caused you so much pain that you question why you still alive ? have you ever been stalked by  the abuser but you cant do anything about it? the reason why i asked in this way because i dealt with something in the past that changed me completely. although i do feel somewhat better now im still struggling with my mental health. my question is, if you ever felt this way how did you rise above it?",shadoerose,2020-02-13 10:51:58,1,512,24.38,99,65.79,1,24.38,16.41,95.51,64.06,21.29,14.84,1.56,0,12.3,0,0.98,6.45,5.66,12.7,9.38,7.42,8.98,1.95,19.73,3.71,2.93,1.56,0.59,1.17,8.59,2.15,6.45,0.39,1.76,0.59,19.14,0.2,0.39,0,0,20.31,5.66,3.71,2.34,4.1,4.1,3.71,2.93,0.98,0.2,1.76,2.15,0.59,1.37,0,0,7.42,1.37,0.78,2.73,0.59,2.93,6.84,10.94,0.98,14.84,1.56,6.64,6.64,0,0.2,0.2,0,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.25,0.59,0.39,0,0,4.1,0,0,0,0.78,0.39,0

f3iz2f,I was sexually abused,"I wanted to share this story because it has affected everything I’ve done since I was a young kid. It’s caused PTSD and panic attacks. I don’t have a dad anymore. At the age of 21 I left home and moved across the country to never have to see him again. I miss my dad because I want a family. It makes me so sad that I’ll never have a father to go to when I have problems. It makes me sad I can’t talk about him or have him at any wedding of mine and that my kids winter have a grandfather. But he is also a terrible person for making the decision to put his sexual gratification before the needs of a young child.

One of the first memories I have of being abused was on a drive home and I asked my dad where babies came from. He then pulled over. He made me take of my pants and he opened everything up to show me. I hadn’t started kindergarten yet, so I was maybe 4 or 5.

The next times were the two worst. Within the next year or two, on two separate occasions. The first time he locked me in his office at work and took off his pants. He wanted to show me a game where I could make white stuff come out. I had to pull on it back and forth until I found the white stuff. The next time we played this game was in his bedroom. My mom was gone and he said it would be better if we shut the door just Incase. He made me jack him off again.

After that, I had to bath naked with him in the tub and we would do it for a long time. We did it frequently and I normally took most of my baths with him. He bathed me and had me help bath him too. I thought it was fun and was still not old enough to understand what was going on. 

A few years later, he met me in my room after one of my showers after I had told him I wanted to stop showering with him. He sat my brother and I on the bed and was trying to get me to take my towel off because it would be fun. I said no and he tried to take it off himself. I didn’t let him. 

After that day, I was terrified of him. I didn’t know why but I was scared and knew something wrong had happened.

When I was in 5th grade, I attended an assembly on sexual abuse. The principals told us all of the things we needed to look out for and report if it happened to us. That’s when I finally found out I had been sexually abused.

The events that caused me trauma around him were extensive. Finding his porn everywhere around the house. Finding out he had cheated on my mom. Waking up to him jacking off to a room of asleep children having a sleepover.

When we were older kids, he took two of my friends to the swimming pool and I said I didn’t want to go. When they came back, they told me he tried to get them to change with him in the family changing room.

I would say the sexual abuse stopped when I was 12 or so but the emotional abuse of living with your abuser for 20 years and keeping it a secret was just as harmful because I had to live in my version of a nightmare.",avgalligator,2020-02-13 15:26:24,1,609,36.5,51.97,75.41,2.05,14.85,9.36,96.22,63.55,23.15,18.39,10.67,1.31,0.16,5.75,0.49,4.76,6.24,14.78,9.52,5.09,7.39,1.64,20.03,5.42,1.81,1.64,2.13,0.66,4.76,0.99,3.78,0.49,1.48,0.49,13.96,1.97,0.16,0.33,6.73,11.33,1.81,2.79,2.63,1.81,0.99,2.63,1.64,0.99,0.66,0,1.64,0.33,0.33,1.15,0,7.72,2.96,1.31,1.48,1.48,0.82,11.17,6.73,0.49,18.39,2.63,7.88,8.21,0.82,2.13,2.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.52,6.57,1.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.64,0,0
f3j8q4,Mum Obsessed Over My Body And Knew My Son's Dad Would Impregnate Me,"So if you guys want to check my profile for the full story go ahead. Briefly... I got pregnant at 10 and gave birth at 11 because of my friend's dad.

Anyway, my mum left when I was 6 because she had dabbled in prostitution for the rush and when my dad found out he told her that she could either leave and give up all rights to me or give up her activity. She left.

Now she is back in my life and tried to get custody of my son but it never made it through processing at social services. She has made it her mission to uproot my life because I won't give her money or let her see my son which I feel is reasonable since the day she left me, she was home alone with me until the next day. Anyway she came to the door again today and when I refused to talk to her, she told me that she has information about my son's dad. I didn't let her speak but she went to my dad and called him. she left a voicemail detailing how my son's dad had admitted to her that he had 'urges' towards kids and she would let him come over when my dad was working and bathe me or just relieve himself. She admitted to sleeping with him as well when I was in the room naked. She blamed me for having a neat down below as a child. Like WTF

I feel disgusted and my dad has turned the voicemail over to police, but honestly I feel the violation happening over again. She is too much, I can't anymore.

f3jzrk,"Escaped abuse, but scared don’t ruining my life","I apologize that this is lengthy, but I have to put it all out there to make sure I can in fact live a happy, normal life like I want to.
I grew up in an extremely violent household, my dad would beat my mom in front of us and then beat us for crying and wanting to protect her. Mom finally left and when she did he abducted and tried to kill her. After brainwashing my older brother and I, he got custody and we were strictly banned from contacting my mother or her family (as an adult it blows my mind that any court would rule in his favor). Any attempted contact would result in violent beating and threats that he would kill himself. As the years went on we often never had food, basic utilities working, proper clothes, medical care etc., while my dad would buy weightlifting equipment and leather jackets for himself. As I started to become he a woman, he began to notice. He started to treat me differently and make me get really fixed up every morning, starting buying me bikinis and taking me tanning so that I could try them on to show him. Then he would make me lay in his bed and I wasn’t allowed to move for hours, he would spoon me even though I told him I wasn’t comfortable with it. I’d scream and cry and he would hit me and make me lay down quiet. He never actually molested me but he would talk about rubbing his penis on me and it makes my stomach twist into a knot to this day. When I tried to get out of the house and make friends he would usually shut it down and make me stay home, except if I could sneak away while he worked. It happened to be during one of these instances that my dad saw me walking down the street with one of my friends and two younger black men happened to be walking not so far behind us. My dad pulled me into the truck and took me home, loaded a 30 ot 6 and held to my face while he asked me numerous times if I was an N***** lover. My brothers never believed me, nor anyone else that I confided in, so I was really on my own. 
I finally moved out of my bedroom window when I turned 18 because I found out he was trashing my acceptance letters to several colleges I was accepted to. This was the final straw for me (of all things, ha). He didn’t want me to leave because he’d have no woman around to cook, clean his house and beat up when he got bored. And long story short I’ve been doing my best to make a life for myself ever since.
I’ve since met the love of my life and just found out we’ll be having a baby. I think we are going to be great parents and I want to have nothing but kindness and love in my home. But I sometimes worry that my past will try to eat up any chance of a bright future for me. I still struggle with anxiety and depression as well as PTSD, I just have never been able to find a therapist who would actually believe any of this and medication has always made me lackluster and dull.

f3o89q,Is my mom really abusive or am I just a spiteful cynical b*tch?,"A few months ago me and my mom got into an argument and I felt the need to leave the house and go to this mental health crisis centre near our local hospital. I don't remember what the argument was about, but I cried the whole walk there and was practically hysterical in the counselor's room. I told him about my history with my mom. For as long as I can remember, she used me as her confidant to the point where she even told me about how she was raped at gunpoint before I was old enough to even know what sex was or what rape really meant for a woman and her self-worth. She mainly talked about her husband— my father— and told me about how she wanted to leave him, how selfish he was, how she was convinced he was cheating. When I was 10 or 11 she told me she wanted to kill herself and told me that if she did do it she'd check into a hotel and do it while I was at school. For six whole months I was terrified I'd come home and a friend or neighbour or my dad would tell me she was dead. At the time, I felt really mature for my age and proud that my mom trusted me like this. Then she divorced my dad and I became really angry, depressed, started hurting and starving myself. She stopped confiding in me since she found a new husband and I became extremely cynical and critical and cold, and I still am that way. Now, on the rare occasion she does confide in me, I'm so emotionally stunted I don't know what to do and I just feel angry that she's taking away my time to be a teenager. 

But like,,, she's a person with feelings too. Why do I have to be such a horrid bitch that when I see someone cry right in front of me I honestly conclude that they're trying to manipulate me? I should be fucking grateful my mom lets me do whatever I want and has treated me like an adult my whole life. I tell all of this to the counselor and he says the term “parentified child” so I look it up on the walk home and never in my life had I felt so understood. But then I read that it's a form of abuse/neglect and I felt so confused.

I never felt abused. My mom is so nice and treats me like an equal for the most part. All my friends are jealous of me and wish they had a mom like her. There are people out there who are actually being abused and I'm just a cynical paranoid bitch who can't be nice enough to comfort my mom or anyone else when they're sad. I'm not abused, I'm just vile. I've never told anyone because I feel so stupid talking about it when other people have it ten times worse.

So... is it abuse? Do I just need to stop being a bitch?",wiitchflowers,2020-02-13 22:32:23,2,531,9.67,39.59,72.96,1,20.42,11.3,97.55,63.47,23.73,18.46,12.81,0.38,0,5.08,0.19,5.27,5.27,10.55,10.55,8.85,10.55,1.32,20.72,4.14,2.26,3.2,0.75,1.69,8.47,1.32,7.16,0.75,4.9,1.13,15.44,2.82,0.75,5.84,1.88,12.99,3.58,1.69,1.69,2.82,1.13,3.58,2.45,0.38,0.19,1.88,1.88,0,0.75,0.75,0.19,4.71,1.88,0.56,0.94,0.38,0.94,8.1,10.92,0.56,11.49,1.13,4.9,5.46,0.75,0.19,0.94,0.19,0,0.38,0.94,0.75,0.19,0,0,0,11.86,4.52,2.64,0,0,0.75,0,0.19,0.38,3.01,0,0.38

f3w7se,Should I be worried?,"Hello!

Admittedly I have been in bad relationships and have learned some bad coping skills. I also have a counselor who believes I could have PTSD. However you folks are so smart and kind and I wanted to ask you first.

So I’m living with a guy and first he was planning some big nice thing for Valentine’s Day then when I would ask about it later he would say “it’s just another day, we can do something another day.” I told him how it bothered me and how shitty I felt about him saying that. He is taking me out tonight but I still don’t get why he changed his mind like that. When we go to dinner he barely talks to me and until recently, always pulled out his phone. He got mad when I asked if he was going to pull out his phone during dinner or ignore me else I don’t want to go. He said he hasn’t done that in a while (he ignored me during dinner just last week lol) but I just let it go. Like shame on me for wanting a nice night with my boyfriend right? He isn’t good with women allegedly so I gave him a break today.

But he’s been starting to act in some more concerning ways. He is really sweet and generous and loving most of the time, but last night I asked him how he gets over things so fast (a quality I envy of his) and he said it’s because the universe is absurd so we should just do whatever we want to do. Then when I asked what that had to do with my question, he said he meant people should follow their passions. I still don’t understand wtf he meant by that.

Then again last night he was staring at me talking and said “if you don’t talk about it, nobody will know” and it was about the news but it sent a chill down my spine. He was looking right in my eyes when I did this.

I saw in his emails (he leaves it open I did no clicking) that he had requested to log into Match.com on Jan 15. We were living together by that time. He logged in at 7 pm then 3 am. He denies it up and down and swears he doesn’t know how that happened. He did delete the account though and I have proof. It bothered me how he had on his profile he wanted to get married but when I bring up a very casual natural talk about marriage he said “I don’t like marriage it gets the government involved.”
He also has had a problem of always tilting his phone away from me but he’s getting better, he only did it twice last night.

He swears he loves me, wouldnt do anything to hurt me, he apologizes, talks it through, and tries to change. He hasn’t been with a girl in many years according to him, and his friends, and he doesn’t hide his emails or facebook. 

But because of my propensity to gravitate towards toxic people I really need advice. The very loving behaviors until we are in public or the dismissal of things like Valentine’s Day bothers me. It may not look like a big deal but weird things have happened and I feel like I’m off balance. I don’t take care of myself like I used to, I’m always worrying if he’s where he says he is because of what he’s said to me and stuff, as you can maybe understand, but he is trying to get better, I just don’t know why I feel so off center and emotional and weepy. It could just be me, as I do feel like I’m kind of going crazy.

f3wjt9,Parents punished me severely for masturbating as a young child. Was this sexual abuse?,"Throwaway account, obviously.

I don't know if this is the right place to ask this question, sorry in advance if it isn't. This feels stupid, but also really hard for me to talk about. I've never told anyone about this. Never had a therapist to confide in, either. 

When I was 7, I (completely accidentally) discovered masturbation. I wasn't exposed to anything sexual as a child (unless you count things I eventually found out on my own on the Internet), so I wasn't sexually abused in the ""classical"" meaning of the term. When my parents eventually caught me doing it, there was a scandal. Screaming, shouting, telling me how awful I am and how awful what I'm doing is. They told me I would go blind, and I believed it up until a certain age. 

Thing is, it didn't stop me from doing it, because of course it wouldn't. I just did it secretly, and felt extremely ashamed. I felt like a horrible person, though I didn't really understand why, because it felt good, right? What could be so bad about that? Every time I got caught, there was more screaming. Sometimes corporeal punishment. This all continued for a couple years.

This all spilled over into my school life. I became extremely anxious in school, though I used to be a pretty happy and sociable child. I felt like if my parents found out, they would kill me, or injure me, or something. (My parents were sometimes verbally/physically aggressive and emotionally manipulative with me when I was younger. Not often, and they stopped when I became a teenager, and haven't done the same with my younger sibling.) 

I've had social anxiety and a bunch of different mental health problems since.  I always found it difficult to understand why I am the way I am, since I was perfectly fine before all this happened. I'm only now starting to connect these dots, despite this time being burned into my memory. I still feel like I 'm at fault for some of this.  

TL;DR accidentally started masturbating as a child, parents were physically and verbally violent about it, though they became better, even great parents soon after and I have a hard time blaming them.  Trying to understand why I developed mental illness.

f3x2g3,What counts as economic abuse or financial abuse?,"Both of my parents have always tried to control me and my siblings by never letting us have money or earn money so we can spend it on things we want etc. Both of my parents have also pretended to be poor, even said things like; how we barely can afford some clothes and made comments about how expensive we are/the food we eat are, and shamed both me and my little sister for the amount we eat (regular portions for active, growing children). 

My parents never allowed me to have a card, instead they made me go directly to them and literally BEG them for money whenever my pants ripped (etc) although they already knew this. My dad also took the birthday-money my grandmother gave me, and said he would return it, which never happened. Also, when my grandmother gave me (a lot of) money to buy whatever I would like to buy, my dad forced me to give it back. When she refused to take it back and told me that she wanted me to have it and promised me that she still had enough money, he forced me to put it somewhere in the house so she would find it later when we had gone home.

When I was really young both of my mother and father refused to buy me clothes I wanted, my mother instead forced me to wear pink/doll-like clothes and my dad forced me to wear boys-clothes (even bought me new pants that were so big in the waist that I constantly had to pull on them and adjust them to avoid them falling down, they were so big and in a rough denim that whenever I tried wearing them with a belt I got red marks, sometimes mild bruising around the waistline from the folds that were the result of the waist being too big for me)

But then, my dad always buys new things. I have noticed that he buys himself either one or two new pairs of winter-boots every year, while I have had mine for more than 3. The shoes he buys are also fairly expensive or very good quality. When he had broke my phone by slamming it on the floor he refused to buy me a new one and refused to come to the repairing-place with me. 

My older sister had to pay for the repair but the guarantee covered most of it. But when his MacBook crashed he didn't even consider repairing it first and just casually bought a new one. I got my Mac solely because I started using his more often to do the homework (sometimes we need to do it digitally) and he got pissed about that. Yet he has brought it up in arguments as if it was my fault, and called me ungrateful for it. I feel so spoiled for writing this. My apologies.

My point is that we have plenty of money, yet both of my parents have brainwashed me and my sisters into thinking that we are poor. I used to be afraid of asking for things I needed, and I never even thought twice when he borrowed my birthday-money, but now I am just livid as soon as I think about how selfish my parents are. Sometimes my sister cries about how she gets teased for not being able to wear fashionable clothes or for not having a phone. I mean she is 9, she doesn't need a phone. But she believes that we are dirt-poor and that we barely can afford food, and it makes me so sad, but how do you explain that our parents are just selfish with money? 

And how dare he ask his own mother, who earns a lot less, for money whenever he wants to ""invest"" in something (like a piano for 20 000 Swedish crowns which is about 2000 American dollars)? He can easily save that amount, it will only take some time, especially since it wasn't really thought through and no-one in our family even plays the piano (I do, but I didn't when he bought it)... He spent around 25 000 Swedish crowns on his saxophone-reparations (maybe more) and he is trying to tell us how terrible people we are if we even try to sell his saxophones when he dies... 

He just spends his money unwisely and is really mad at me and my sisters in general, so I think this has to do with him not finding us deserving of more money or love. I don't know what to do about my situation and he has clearly refused to pay for any future education that I might want or need to get a good job. He has also spoken about how he will never pay anything for us, yet expects us to take care of him when he gets old... I am just crushed and angry.",Forgetful-Fairy,2020-02-14 11:11:56,2,838,12.25,61.74,37.53,8.61,28.9,13.25,93.32,60.5,22.91,17.06,8.71,2.51,0.12,4.65,1.07,5.73,3.22,11.81,7.76,9.9,10.02,1.67,17.18,4.42,2.03,3.22,1.67,2.51,3.94,1.19,2.63,0.36,0.84,0.48,14.56,2.74,0,2.15,4.42,13.72,1.91,2.63,1.79,3.46,1.55,3.7,1.19,0.24,0.72,0.24,2.39,1.79,0,0,0.48,10.14,4.18,0.95,3.22,1.79,0.24,5.37,9.9,0.95,11.22,0.95,3.94,6.56,1.43,0.24,0.48,4.65,0,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0,11.69,3.82,3.34,0,0.12,0.36,0,1.07,0.24,0.6,1.91,0.24
f41l1f,What would you call this sort of person?,"I feel like I'm being emotionally abused by my younger sibling who makes me feel like I'm not worthy of being respected, loved, or should have the same privileges as her.   


She is:   
self-centered or however you may term this, basically she doesn't see herself in the wrong and if you do you, it's like an act against god.   
any inconvenience that happens to LITERALLY everyone, she acts like the world is out to get her.   
if something doesn't go her way, she'll throw a major hissy fit depending on what it is.   
a constant thief, and a constant liar. if she's been caught red-handed of stealing something, she'll start to cry and make it feel like you should pity her.  
literally inconsiderate of other people; she'll litter all over the bloody place yet complain if anyone else doesn't pick up their things, this is not exclusive to trash -- in other words, a hypocrite. she'll also be wrong about various things of a person, yet act more accurate to the definition of her insults.   
take other people's kindness for granted without return nor a speck of gratitude, yet still expect it to be done for her because it's the ""family rules.""   
she doesn't give a shit of one's struggles if it's in the way or seems like an ""excuse"" to not getting what she wants, it can be finical wise or mental illness wise.   
damages and vandalizing things if it means she gets what she wants.   
irrational over things that cannot be helped nor will comply to how she wants it like the cues she's giving will immediately tell what thing she's having an issue with will listen and stop ( ex: when my rabbit is making noise, eating, chewing on his favourite toys, she'll be banging on the wall or the bed ). things must go by how SHE wants it, if anyone else wants it their way, it's invalid, it must be HER'S.   
she expects her wishes to go granted, yet can't respect the wishes of other people ( ex: i want to be alone in my room, however she ignores this, she demands i leave the room if she wants to be alone otherwise she starts telling me to get out like a psychopath on paper, we cannot coexist in the same room apparently )

f463s2,Should I tell my counselor my abuser texted me?,"When I was younger, I was sexually abused by a guy in my class. When I was in seventh grade, he texted me about it and I replied with, 'lmfao. We we were little kids'

I made that response because when I'm uncomfortable, I pretend I don't care. Anyways, my mom found out when I was 15 and so my first counselor found out and my current one knows too. When it was reported by my first counselor, I didn't tell her anything about the text message.

Later, I realized that it would be critical evidence. The problem was that I didn't want police to get involved. Now I'm 17 and the police have never done anything about the old report. I've been remembering a lot of the things that happened lately.

I feel like talking about the text message with my counselor but also feel like I don't want to go to court because that would be evidence. I feel like I'm supposed to be cool with the guy who did that to me because we texted each other. (I know it sounds dumb.)

So, 2 questions: How likely is it that the police would get involved if I told my counselor about the text.

And did the way I replied to his text sound too much like I was fine with it for police to even step in?

I really don't want police to get involved so I was hoping I could tell my counselor and not get the police involved.",sasukeknowsdawae,2020-02-14 23:15:12,3,262,9.5,23.42,79.55,20.03,16.38,14.5,96.95,62.6,24.05,17.18,14.89,1.15,0,1.15,0,6.87,4.96,11.45,12.21,8.78,8.02,2.67,23.66,1.91,2.29,2.67,2.67,1.15,4.2,1.91,2.29,0.38,1.53,0,12.6,0.38,0.76,0.76,1.53,16.03,4.96,2.29,4.2,3.05,0.38,2.67,2.29,0,0.76,1.53,0.38,0,0,0.38,0,8.02,3.05,0.76,2.29,1.53,0.38,9.92,11.83,0.38,8.78,0.76,2.67,5.34,6.11,0,0,0,0,0,1.53,0.76,0.38,0.38,0,0.38,14.5,5.34,3.05,0.38,0,0.76,0,0,0,4.2,0.76,0

f4efhz,Feeling overwhelmed,"I’ve been with my partner for 15 years. We have a young child together and just bought a house. He's always had issues but I feel like ever since I got pregnant they have gotten worse. I remember collapsing on the floor crying because I was pregnant with morning sickness causing me to throw up constantly for weeks and I couldn't take it. Instead of comforting me, he said I better grow up because I was acting like a baby. When the baby was born, I took a year maternity leave and he wouldn't help me look after the baby at night because he had to work in the morning. Our baby didn't sleep, which meant I never slept for a year + for more than a couple of hours. I seriously feel like I have brain damage from that struggle. He also now refuses to go out or allow me to have people over. When I do go out I am made to feel that I should be guilty. I feel like I am walking on eggshells because anything can get him angry. So far it has just been verbal. He's said things like ""I hope you die"" etc. I guess I've been with him my whole adult life and I'm only now realising how bad it has been. He now seems to be getting increased anxiety problems where he takes out his stress by telling me how I've done everything wrong. It turns into a yelling brigade directed at me for half an hour or more. One time I resorted to closing my eyes and covering my ears so that I wouldn't have to hear it. He sprayed me in the face with a cleaning spray. That was a few months ago. 

I don't know what I'm looking for with this post. Maybe just someone telling me that they hear me. I don't know what to do. I don't think I would get sole custody of our child and can't bear the thought of only seeing them half the time. We are in a very expensive city and I'm not sure I could afford to live on my own even though I'm the breadwinner I guess I'm overwhelmed.

f4hpqe,Moving on from an Emotionally Abusive Relationship,"Hello everyone, 

I have been taking big efforts in allowing myself to grow the past 4 months. In November I broke up with my boyfriend of 2.5 years. 

Little did I realize that the reason of the break up which was to focus on my mental health due to my spiked anxiety and depression....was from him. 

We had cycles of him getting angry with me not being “perfect” and always happy. He would get angry if my tone changed or if I didn’t agree with something he said. The relationship was full of gaslighting and comparison. I was compared to an ex multiple times and it made me not like her (she was a family friend of his and they were always sooo friendly). He would call me selfish for having anxiety attacks (the first time he tried to break up with me was after I had an anxiety attack at a party and I never had one before). He wouldn’t reach out to me if I was okay afterwards. He didn’t visit me after I had surgery on my knee. He would pretend as if we never had issues or would dismiss big relationship talks. 

He didn’t respect my mixed heritage of being black and white. He said the n word for the first year of our relationship and would get upset if I asked him to stop because it was disrespectful. He would become very bitter though if I didn’t perform correctly for his Filipino culture. That meant with words, food, and etc., I needed to be respectful but not him. 

I tried really hard to always be nice and forgiving. I forgave him for getting mad at me and I would promise to try harder in expressing myself. But it wasn’t me....it was him not being able to be challenged and not be in control. 

Last summer I studied abroad in Korea and he continued the cycle while I was abroad. He called me the day before I got my tattoo while in Korea and told me I was dumb, selfish, and not considering his culture while getting a tattoo. That I wasn’t thinking it through and that I needed to change my design. And I told him what he said upset me and he hung up on me. That was hard because I was 13 hours ahead on the other side of the world. He didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t talk to me for 5-6 weeks out of the 7 weeks I was in Korea. He didn’t really reply to my messages until the week I was coming home. 

All this happened months after we had a huge fight in public after a party got busted. We got separated from our friends and we got stuck with a few friends who were too intoxicated to be in public. And I was wanting to leave to get them to be sobering up, and he was yelling at me. Telling me I was selfish, self-centered, and didn’t care that our friends got separated from us. I kept telling him that we needed to take our group of 5 somewhere safe first and then find our other friends because they didn’t go far(the 2 missing friends went out the back of the house to the McDonalds nearby). He kept yelling at me and then I crouched on the ground scared because he went crazy and started saying that he wanted to break up with me because I was selfish and I don’t care about people...which is the exact opposite. Then he hit the hood of the car next to me with his hand and that was the first time he got physical. One of the intoxicated friends told him he needed to calm down, a cop told him to calm down, and another person outside the house told him to calm down. 

From the Korea incident plus all the incidences leading up to our break up....I realize since August of 2019-November 2019 I was mentally checking out of our relationship. I knew I needed and wanted to break up with him. It was all about when and how. I began distancing myself from him and his family because I felt uncomfortable(he told me his mom would’ve hit me if I was around when we had the issue with my tattoo and then said it was a “metaphor”). 

The break up was fine. I felt better with him not around. Then I reached out to be friends...big big big big mistake. I realized I had “feelings” still for him and told him and he freaked out. Since then we have been engaging in an exhausting extension of the abusive cycle but outside of the relationship. He wanted to be “friends” but continues the strives of emotional abuse and manipulation. 

He now works on my campus as an alumni staff. He is going to undergraduate events and talking about me poorly to other people. He is calling my friends and trying to get them involved by telling them he is sorry for his anger but not telling me. I feel unsafe on my campus. I had to drop out of my student organizations out of fear of seeing him there and worried about his reactions. I can’t block his email because it’s a campus work email and since I’m a student worker I can’t block emails in the same organization. He is now on campus on days he doesn’t work. He emailed last week before I had a date to meet up. He emailed me this week “standing up” for someone I blocked because they were his on campus spy watching me. 

There are multiple reports out on him on campus to get him to not be in undergraduate spaces since he is a staff not a student and his behavior is problematic. And now I’m trying to move on and date and his energy keeps blocking me because my campus safety and campus life isn’t okay. I’m romantically and mentally and emotionally moving on but physically I can’t because of his presence on campus and his affiliation to my student organizations that I’ve been apart of since my 1st year. 

Now I’m paranoid about dates being interested in me because they haven’t responded in days due to having normal lives but my body can’t help but think oh is it because they want to isolate me?? And I know it isn’t and it’ll take time to re-wire my brain. I have talked to many campus services who are helping me out but....I am being blocked from enjoying all of my life being happy and healthy if my campus life (and I live and work on my schools campus) isn’t balanced.

Does anyone have advice on how to move around this block? Or how to practice on not being paranoid in a potentially healthy relationship? 

Does anyone have advice on what I should do if I do see him in person if I begin to reclaim myself in these spaces on campus that used to be safe for me?? 

I just need help because now it’s just escalated to a point where it isn’t just unhealthy for me but unhealthy too for my friends who are helping me create safe spaces.",got_tyra,2020-02-15 15:28:13,0,1232,38.16,44.52,72.53,18.58,19.25,14.85,94.56,61.93,21.27,17.53,9.74,1.3,0,5.84,0.65,3.65,4.22,16.15,9.66,3,8.69,2.92,18.59,4.63,1.22,1.06,1.3,0.81,6.41,2.92,3.41,0.89,1.14,0.41,15.34,0.24,1.22,0.24,5.76,13.07,1.54,2.6,2.76,1.79,1.14,5.19,1.7,0.41,0.57,0.65,1.62,0.32,1.14,0,0.16,10.96,3.9,1.95,3.33,1.62,0.57,8.52,7.71,0.89,16.72,1.46,8.04,6.82,3.08,0.41,0.41,0.08,0,0,0.65,0.16,0.08,0.24,0.08,0,12.58,6.66,0.89,0,0,0.49,0,0.32,0.81,2.6,0.81,0
f4j1pr,How do you handle no contact when abuser can't live without you?,"I first went no contact 3 years ago. My god, the most incredible feeling and best choice I made. But I felt a horrible guilt. Because I felt responsible for my abuser. She should threaten to kill herself a lot (probably to manipulate, she did that when I wasn't compliant) as well as never took care of her physical health, so when I went no contact I felt I was torturing her, I felt so incredibly guilty every day, wondering how she was doing, if she was eating, if she might kill herself...I would break no contact several times out of guilt. I feel so terrible. I worry about her all the time. I do have the guts to go no contact,, I have reported her to police a while back, but what's mostly holding me from staying NC for long periods of time, and pressing charges is that if I do that, she will probably kill herself, or stop eating or something. I have heard stories about peoples abusers killing themselves before, so it's somewhat rational to feel this way, it's not solely because she mundfucjed me into being her caregiver when I was young.

f4m8py,Was my ex abusive?,"Background: I was with my ex for about 1.5 years. He’s 2 years older than me and twice my size. He knew that 2 months prior to our first date that I was sexually assaulted. 

Early in the relationship, I was in the middle of changing and he took a photo of me. I asked him to delete it but he said he didn’t have “the cloud” so it didn’t matter any way. 

Due to being an assault survivor I didn’t want to have sex very often but he was guilt me into it a lot. Then he would choke me during sex. I told him that I didn’t like it but he did it anyways. 

He would constantly accuse me of cheating even though I never speak to other men because I’m scared of them after what happened to me. 

He would always pick fights with me. He “forgot” that we were going out for my birthday and got mad at me for crying about it. Then he ghosted me at Christmas when he was supposed to see me and went to a movie with a friend. So I spent that Christmas alone. 

When I broke up with him he blew up my phone telling me that I was making a mistake and if I didn’t come back that he would kill himself. 

I know that what I dealt with wasn’t healthy but I’m not sure if it could be classified as abuse.",theburgerofdisaster,2020-02-15 21:32:36,3,248,9.25,22.18,67.89,1,15.5,9.68,95.56,66.94,29.03,21.77,12.9,0.81,0,7.66,0.4,7.26,3.63,13.71,10.89,5.65,8.06,3.23,20.16,3.63,2.02,1.61,2.02,0.81,6.85,1.21,5.65,0.81,3.23,1.21,14.11,0,0.81,0,8.06,14.52,0.81,1.61,3.63,2.42,1.21,6.45,2.02,0.81,1.21,0,1.61,0,0.4,1.21,0,5.24,1.61,1.21,1.61,0.81,0,11.29,5.24,1.21,14.92,1.61,4.44,9.27,0,0.4,0,0.4,0.81,0.81,1.21,0,0,0,0,0.4,12.9,6.05,0.4,0.4,0,0.4,0,0,1.61,4.03,0,0
f4q5wc,My father had just openly said that someone who has been abused and doesn't do anything and lets it happen again means it is their fault.,"1. My father overview: 50+ yo, from a wealthy good family, his father was physically abusive with my grandma and with the three kids (one of them has problems with alcohol, and the other one has had a tumultuous relationships in life), my dad had issues with drugs and alcohol he decided to enter the military service and clean himself, he travelled a lot and knew different realities, he met my mom and got married.
2. My parents' relationship is not great, I won't say much but the other side of the coin when studying psycology is that you learn to see the behaviors of others in a more rational light and sometimes the view is not pretty. 
3. I have been abused more than once and told 1 person who I no longer speak to for other reasons. This is where my point finally arrives:

I don't care of he is my father, we don't really have a relationship and more of this things come out I am more aware that I do not want that relation, my sibling is more open and talks and tries to make him understand but he victim blames in any case; I don't blame him tho, even if he doesn't know it I know what it is to be abused, how much hate can that create in you, I don't hate him either at all, I really don't want any kind of hate to grow in my life.
 I will live and move on and try to be a better person, I know who to count on or not and I know how to be by myslef for myslef first, because I am worth of a good life.",droses21,2020-02-16 04:41:15,3,310,20.31,44.88,49.78,9.78,34.44,11.61,94.84,59.03,20.32,13.23,7.74,0.65,0.65,3.55,0.65,7.1,4.52,10.65,11.61,3.55,8.06,4.19,22.9,4.19,3.23,2.58,3.23,3.87,6.45,2.58,3.87,0,2.9,0,14.84,3.55,0,0.65,5.16,15.48,4.19,2.26,1.29,3.55,0.32,5.48,1.94,0.97,0.97,0,2.58,0,2.58,0,0.65,8.06,3.55,1.61,0.97,1.61,0.65,3.87,18.39,0.65,8.39,1.94,4.52,1.94,0.97,0.97,0.32,0.97,0,0,0.65,0,0.65,0,0,0,12.58,2.9,4.84,0.65,0.32,0,0,0,0,2.9,0.65,0.32
f4rqmy,Am I abusive?,"Last night, I (a girl) went out drinking with a few friends. My boyfriend of four years joined when he got off of work. I was already pretty lit and he was the DD, so he wasn’t drinking. Anyway, he smacked me on the ass in front of my friends, which made me feel really embarrassed,especially because of how drunk I was. Immediately after he did that, I slapped him on the face. I meant for it to be somewhat playful, but it clearly hurt him emotionally (I’m not very strong so I don’t know how much it hurt physically, but physical pain isn’t the only type of pain). On the drive home he said that if he had done that to me I would never see him again. That’s probably true. I don’t know if that means he’s going to break up with me, but I don’t want to lose him.

f4uv2h,Can you be abused by authority in general?,"There's this paedophile hunter on youtube called ""Shane Brannigan"", basically he was abused by a sex offender, and it comes off on his mental health, I also feel on the same side of Shane from watching his vids, and it annoys me when I suspect someone's a pedo, that's an example of more direct abuse, and is more obvious to spot, even though I don't ever think it's obvious to spot emotional abuse, you just tend to accept it as normal. I notice the sex offenders on these videos actually seem quite similar to what i've experienced, it all just seems to be very nasty, which reminds me of authority that i've dealt with, they're always horrid.

I find authority where I live as abusive, and it kind of trickles down for some reason, it's a way of getting obedience, I find there's all kinds of mind games authority plays with you, from being in care I could never say what I have been through is abuse, but not sure if it is, when people have realized they've been abused, it tends to be years later, and you always feel as if your in the wrong for speaking out, i'm not sure if it's happened to me, but when Shane talks about how it's affected him, I kind of can relate, abusers are probably so without even knowing.

I always kind of felt like I couldn't speak out against it, like you could never criticize social services, not only that I feel a sense something not right, but kind of don't understand, well, isn't this true in most cases of abuse? You don't really notice what's happening to you at first, it all just feels so evil, you don't speak out against it, you feel you can't.",Dantez1993,2020-02-16 10:35:50,0,301,15.4,33.29,85.1,1,50.17,15.61,94.68,60.13,20.27,11.63,6.31,0,3.65,1.33,0.33,8.64,2.66,15.28,11.96,8.97,7.31,4.65,22.26,5.32,3.65,2.99,0.33,2.33,8.31,2.33,5.98,0.33,4.65,0,9.3,0,0,0,1.33,23.26,6.98,1.33,1.99,4.98,4.65,6.31,4.65,0.66,1.33,1.99,1.33,0,0.66,0.66,0,3.65,0.66,1.66,1.99,0.33,0.33,2.99,16.94,0,10.96,0.33,6.31,4.32,0.33,1.33,0,0,0,0,0.33,0,0,0,0.33,0,19.93,1.33,10.3,0,0,0.66,0,0,0.66,6.98,0,0
f4vx4h,should i (16F) be trying to fix my relationship with my father?,"My father has been negligent of me and my brother for a long time, and it’s gotten to the point where I haven’t seen him in 4 years. For the past 6 years I’ve been dealing with trauma from abuse in my house (physically/sexually from my brother, verbal from my mom) and he never even tried to support me through any of it. He didn’t let any of the family on his side know that we were struggling (financially and emotionally from lots of different mental illnesses) and since they live across the country I basically had no contact or support from them at all. 

When I overdosed in 2016 at age 11, he didn’t call me or reach out. I spent 8 days in a mental hospital waiting for a call. His lack of presence only fueled the resentment I had towards him, and it’s been slowly building ever since. I get angry when I think about him, but he’s so emotionally unavailable to try to talk to, or at least he was not even a year ago. His mother and all his sisters are “dead to him” (in his own words) after his wife tried to turn them against me and my brother by telling them what he did to me (they didn’t believe her, defending my brother, and my dad now refuses to talk to them for calling my step mom a liar). 

He’s been calling me more and more recently, but he refuses to talk to me if his wife is home, meaning he’ll only call me while he’s at work, making it MY job to mold MY schedule around what’s convenient for HIM. And half the time he’s always boasting about himself and his job and the great reputation he has there anyway. My birthday was two weeks ago, and he was telling everyone that I had just turned 15. He didn’t even bother to remember my age, just that “his baby girl is growing up”. He’s a textbook narcissist. My family is telling me that I need to reach out to him and make an effort to fix this, but I don’t fucking want to. If he can’t figure out how to fix it himself, I don’t want that kind of man as my father. One of my other brothers accused me of letting my ego get in the way of this. Is he right? Am i being too stubborn?

f4x0qb,Need advice. I cant stay in this house anymore.,"I know its long, but its a very whack story, and the fact people behave this way is BEYOND me. 

If youre lazy, just scroll and read the quick version, although you will miss important information.

So I started dating my partner two years ago, we are great together, almost perfect. I am almost certain that this will last, anyway -

He has a twin brother, who has this (ex?) girlfriend (idno what the hell she is).
First time I saw her, she looked me up and down in disgust, so she already had a grudge and seemed weirdly jealous of me and walked away.

Anyway, a few weeks went by and I was drawing in my partners room whilst he was working 9pm-1am. She comes in the room SO drunk, and insisted me on having a cigarette with her, so I do. First thing she brings up, is the discussion of me moving into that house, she said she told the  boys ""Im not living with that slut!"" (she hadnt moved in yet, and tbh her bf didnt want her to). So she continued to degrade me and called me nasty names, also told me how i should delete my partner off facebook because SHE didnt like the things i tagged him in (relationship and warcraft memes, ikr shes whack). So she already began trying to manipulate my relationship. Weirdly jealous.She also proceeded to whisper to me about her ""secret life"" behind her BFs back, basically she was selling ""work"" lol.. and cheating on him. She was trying to convince me to do the same. She whispered that to me discreetly because the BF was inside. I confronted her about that, and told her im not an ""everybodys girl"". She seemed to get defensive, and randomly blasted out a story of her (alledged) molestation as a child (i believe to be false, because she lets her own child stay wih them). And tried to gain sympathy and victimize herself, so I told her about the time I witnessed my dads suicide, yeah, that shut her up real quick. Her whole attitude pissed me off so I politely told her I needed to finish my drawings and went back inside. I did this politely as I could, to avoid drama

Immediately i texted my partner all the shit she told me, and i was kinda having a panic attack and felt really upset at the things she said to me. My partner then messaged the brother and then the BF and the GF fought. Then a day later she randomly messaged me on facebook giving me some bullshit fake apology and blaming it on her alcoholism. I didnt respond, because i didnt want it to go further.

Few weeks go by, I moved in, then she did too. I avoided her to avoid conflict. Some of the things she did whilst i was there were: She abused and yelled at her BF for hanging out a piece of my clothing in the washing machine (?), she forged a signature in order to keep her daughter (i mention this because i AM worried for the daughter; everyone is), she argued with the boys A LOT (like every day)

During this whole time, i was always polite to her, wished her merry christmas, gave her a card and a hug etc etc. I kept the peace.

Anyway, one day my partner was in the shower and I was working on a design in our room. (She also waits till im alone to say/do anything, youll see why this is important later); she proceeds to talk and wants to sort out the ""drama"". I told her i didnt have a problem with her, im just not a social person. and she ask why i didnt respond to her on facebook, and again, im not a social person (and i didnt believe her fake apology). I was still polite, I just ignored it.

Thennnnn one day, I was typing up my Grad Program entry exam, and it requires a lot of focus, and then I hear her yell and scream the same abusive and degrading things she called and said to me when I first spoke to her. (I have PTSD with yelling, and it puts me back in an anxious and angry state, where I feel like im back in school and have to defend myself).. So I yell ""Shut up"" because i HAVE to concentrate. Then she comes out and starts screaming and abusing me, yelling ""I always stayed out of yor business, so stay out of mine"".. this for a sec made me chuckle... remember when she tried to control my relationship?

My PTSD rage mechanism kicked in, I punched her in hopes to shut her up and to stop abusing me and acting superior.

She didnt stop. She continued. It got worse. I decided to disengage from that house because of her, the same traits, the same distress response, the same everything it gives me, it put me back in a bad place, even hearing her voice put me back and I got bad again.

Me and my partner moved to his parents house (3-4 hours away, which is good, it is close to a place i am doing work experience at). So I like it here, things are great and looking up for me, I am improving mentally and physically. 

Then his brother moved in. Their relationship didnt work when it came to living together, he said it was toxic and he had to get out, and he moved into the parents house. I didnt feel good about this.

She started coming over (keep in mind - I moved here to begin with, to get away from her, and to avoid conflict and hurt.) Her excuse was that her daughter had behaviour issues and so she dropped her off at the mums (which was an hour from our house). I was told it was a one time thing (yeah right) and I discussed with my
partner that the daughter must feel isolated, and is probably acting in a way that she doesnt agree.

She heard that, and this is where it started. Fake accounts on facebook, messaging me calling me nasty names, saying my relationship wont last, calling ME abusive?! Calling me unstable (yeah cos of people like you).

I didnt respond to that, I got used to blocking and deleting for a LONG time. They kept coming, mainly whenever her and her BF would fight. One day, Id had enough. 

I told her to stop projecting her issues onto me, and to stop contacting me and to stay away from me.

Then she came over again. Her voice did it again. into that aggressive stage again.

I have no say in who comes into the house, nor does my partner, cos its not our house. Their mother cares, because she understands my perspective, but they dont want to lose their son. So theyre enabling my abuser to stay in a home which I fleed to because of her.

They broke up again, blah blah blah. More harrassing messages, defaming me in posts, back together blah blah blah.

I got sick of it. I confronted her again, I told her that ""I told you to leave me alone, and to stay away from me. Stop sending harrassing messages from fake accounts"" She lied and denied she didnt do anything, a week later she admits that she did, proving she lied to save face, but because i replied, her BF ignored it, and enabled the abuse further.


The most manipulative part, is that they plan to get her to come over on Sundays. Where my partner works from 9am-9pm. Where i am alone, vulnerable and where he cant help me, support me or defend me.

Always a sunday.

Its ongoing. I am done.
She came back today. And Im so fucking done. As soon as i heard her voice again. It made me slip back into bad again, i spent my afternoon anxiety vomitting in the room and it broke me down bad. The voice of one of my abusers is something that triggers me back into a bad mental state; my hair is on the floor, my arms are fucked. i cant continue living in a house where everyone enables the abuse, and blantantly ignores how it impacts me. 

I tried to disengage and get away from her, but she follows. Its like the criminal who comes back to see the crime scene. She is a narcissistic person who comes back to victims to demean people. she is jealous of me for some weird reason, so she tried to pick at my insecurity and mental health  (because she knows its there). She defames me to make me feel worthless, she puts me back into a trauma which already exists.

SHORT STORY ------------

My boyfriends brothers girlfriend has demeaned me, degraded me, defamed me, harrassed me for a year and a half,  and due to the impact it has on my mental health decline, i now consider her as my abuser.

I left the original house we all lived at, to get away from her abuse, but now her bf lives here because he cant stand living with her, and now theyre back together and brings her over.

Her voice triggers ptsd and severe anxiety and it relapse again and this is the last straw for me

Only brings her over when my bf is at work and im alone and dont have him for support, and everyone besides my bf is enabling her behaviour. My bf cant do much because its not his house.

I want to do something about this. I cant move out yet, but I cant deal with the result of her coming over, Im trying to get my mental health improved before i study again. Help me.

f4y1ji,Is what happened to me abuse?,"Last year I started dating one of my friends. We had had fights and stuff prior to this but I genuinely thought he was a nice person he just had some problems. 

At first I really liked him. But then things started to get weird. He talked about sex constantly, and I just wasn’t interested in it. He tried to send me nudes once (couple years before this, another ex forced me into sending him nudes. I got in trouble for this, not the person who forced me.) I told him I didn’t want any, and that I didn’t want to get in trouble again. He was so mad. He said I hated him, sent me pictures of him cutting himself, and then... disappeared. He didnt text me until midnight the next day. I was so worried and I felt physically sick, I thought he killed himself and it was going to get me in trouble. 

This happened multiple times. If I ever did something he didn’t like he’d suicide bait me. This was awful for me, especialy as my eating disorder and depression were the worst they’d ever been. I started starving myself as an attempt to kill myself. 

I remember once at school he said he was going to pick me up. I told him not to and he wrapped his arms around me, groping my chest. Once he grabbed my butt even though he said he was going to and I said not to. He used to just hug me and not let go, and it doesn’t sound that bad but I hated it, I felt so claustrophobic and uncomfortable and he wouldn’t let go no matter how much I struggled. 

The worst episode was when I tried to leave him. He had an issue with one of my friends as she was his ex and they didn’t get along. She knew how bad he could get and in hindsight she was trying to warn me. He realized this quicker than I did and told me I had to pick between him and having friends. I told him I didn’t want to pick, and then spent two hours talking him out of suicide. He sent me a picture of a knife, said he was going to slash his throat and wrists. He also called me so many awful things and names. Eventually I couldn’t take it anymore, I just had to get away from him somehow so I blocked him and prayed that he didn’t do anything. He didn’t show up to school for three days and I thought he did it, I was terrified. I thought he told someone it was my fault and that I told him to and that he told my parents (they didn’t know I was in a relationship with him.) 

I really struggle with relationships now because of that, but he never hit me or really controlled me so I don’t know if it was abuse.",vangogh-thot,2020-02-16 13:58:55,3,501,3.87,36.72,37.95,1,15.18,13.57,96.61,65.27,29.54,23.55,12.38,0.2,0,10.38,0.6,5.99,2,11.18,9.58,5.79,9.98,3.99,23.55,3.19,1.6,1,1.6,1.4,6.59,1,5.59,1,1.6,0.2,18.16,0.2,0.6,0.6,9.78,12.97,2.4,2,1.8,2,0.6,5.19,2.59,0.8,1.2,0.6,2.4,1.4,0.4,0.6,0.4,7.58,1.8,0.8,1.4,1.6,2,14.37,4.79,1.8,11.38,2.2,2.79,6.39,0.4,0,0,0.2,0.2,0.8,0.6,0.2,0,0,0,0,14.17,6.79,3.19,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,3.19,0.8,0
f50tv3,A couple of stalkers have sole access to my router. What are they seeing and how do I stop it?,"I hope this is the last time I will have to ask questions regarding this because I'm at my limit. Previously I've asked questions about this and gotten a few responses, thank you to those people. This is the situation – my mom and I are currently in a mentally/verbally abusive/stalker-esque situation with other family members and one of the invasive ways they meddle in our lives is by keeping tabs on the router. I.e, they have the username/password to it and keep us locked out aside from wifi connection, and they therefor patrol everything we do online, I have even been confronted with it early on. they will likely see this post but I'm past the point of caring.     
  A week or two ago the internet would not work and I finally got the courage to do a manual reset on the router and boot them off and out of the app. Today they dropped by announced and reset the router back to an unknown username and password and again only gave us access to the wifi network password, and they can once again spy on everything we do.     
  I have a couple of questions, the first being, what exactly can they see? When I reset it and had the app, I could not see specific URLs visited, just a very general ""top 5"" visited sites, some of which (like e-mail and google searches) didn't even show up under names like ""google"" or ""gmail."" however, I know for a fact that in the past they have seen specific URLs we've visited, when we did, and seen private DMs. Someone in a previous post mentioned spyware, and yes, spyware was installed on my old computer, but not my mother's, (that I know of) which also had exact URLs seen on it. so again, what can they see, and what are they using to see it?   
  My second question is what can I do to put a permanent stop to this invasion of privacy? Thanks for any input. I will be putting this both on technology and abuse subs.",horrorflicks,2020-02-16 17:28:05,1,373,41.77,60.58,74.4,40.21,21.94,16.09,86.33,59.25,18.77,11.53,6.17,1.88,0.27,0,3.22,7.24,6.97,12.33,10.46,4.83,8.04,1.07,16.35,2.41,0.8,2.68,1.61,1.61,2.41,1.61,0.8,0,0.8,0,10.46,0.8,0,0.54,0,9.38,1.61,1.34,0.8,2.95,1.88,2.68,2.95,2.95,0,0,0.27,0,0.27,0,0,5.9,2.41,1.07,1.07,1.07,0.54,5.9,11.53,1.07,15.28,1.34,7.24,6.43,0.54,0.27,0.27,0,0,0,0.8,0,0.54,0.27,0,0,15.55,3.75,5.09,0,0,1.07,0,0.54,1.61,1.61,1.07,0.8

f55a4w,"An abusive relationship made me believe I'm stupid, and it is controlling my life. I don't know how to heal.","For a year, I (F 22) was in an abusive relationship with someone I met at my internship. I entered the relationship in a vulnerable state -- I had been sexually assaulted less than a year before, was working 80+ hours a week, and was fighting intense imposter syndrome, anxiety, and depression. I had not initially wanted to date anyone because I wanted to heal, but he (M 23) and my internship friends pushed, and I eventually relented one night when I was drunk. I was in such a dark place, and he made me so happy at first.

My intern friends and I didn't realize it at first, but he was a psychopath. Initially charismatic, funny, and extremely intelligent, I later realized he lied compulsively, was unable to feel empathy, and loved to manipulate his friends, family, co-workers, and even strangers.

The relationship was horrible. He declared our relationship ""undefined"" but simultaneously called me his girlfriend and accused me of cheating. He texted me hundreds of texts everyday and called anywhere from 2-10 times a day. He sent me love notes and called me pet names, but would deny any relationship when I asked. He talked about killing my dog. He would quiz me on difficult mental math problems, ancient world leaders, and obscure philosophical debates. He made fun of me, my family, and my friends. I felt like I was in a dense fog, and over time I started to lose my sense of self. Intellectually, I reverted inwards -- I fundamentally believed that I was incapable of making intelligent thoughts or decisions.

When I finally left my abusive ex-boyfriend, I called his roommate to clear my mental fog and learn the truth. I was told my ex cheated on me, made fun of my sexuality, and gas lighted me to believe I was in a real relationship with him. He plotted ways to emotionally and verbally abuse me and purposefully told other people my secrets, particularly about my previous sexual assault. He even tried to get other people to anonymously call and text me to tell me I was lying about my assault.

I was shaken to hear about all the things he did behind my back, but the thing that destroyed me was hearing the reason he never wanted to be with me: **He thought I wasn't smart or career oriented enough to date.** He chose to play and abuse with me instead.

The emotional scars he left are deep, but this one feels fatal. I can't shake the idea that I'm stupid. I spend nearly every day looking for ways to become more intelligent, or at least present myself to others as smarter than I am. All of my new hobbies relate to intellectual and professional growth -- learning statistical programming, reading biographies, watching documentaries, learning languages, etc. I critique myself every second of the day -- putting cans on the shelf in an inefficient way, pulling out the wrong debit card at the store, using a word incorrectly. If I can't present myself as intelligent, I disengage or try to make it seem like I'm purposefully failing.

I've been starting to heal with a therapist, but I've been triggered by small recent events. When asking for career advice on a job offer, my dad told me that ""they can train monkeys, so they can train you."" A friend told me today that another friend thinks I'm too dense to read social ques and am fundamentally stupid.

Part of me, deep deep down, knows that I have to be intelligent to some degree -- I recently graduated a top-tier university with a high GPA and have several job offers -- but I keep telling myself that I have accomplished these things based purely on hard-work and the help I've received from others.

I feel like I'm going crazy -- I might be disassociating . My head is spinning, and I feel like I'm worthless. I don't want to live like this anymore, but perfectionism and the fear of appearing or being stupid is consuming my entire life.

Anyone else feel this way? Does anyone have thoughts on recovery? I don't know how to help myself.",throwaway673910,2020-02-16 23:39:42,5,715,38.89,29.26,91.48,4.49,18.82,20.42,91.05,53.01,20.7,16.78,13.29,0.14,0.14,2.94,0.28,3.92,4.48,11.61,7.97,3.5,7.55,1.26,18.04,5.73,2.52,0.84,1.54,1.82,7.69,2.8,4.9,0.84,2.66,0.56,12.73,0.42,1.54,0,3.08,14.83,4.06,2.38,1.12,2.66,1.96,3.92,2.1,0.7,0.28,0.98,2.1,0.14,1.12,0.42,0.14,8.81,3.64,2.66,2.8,0.14,0.7,7.41,8.81,0.42,12.03,1.4,5.31,5.59,2.94,0.98,0.56,0.42,0.14,0.28,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,18.74,5.17,6.43,0.14,0,0.28,0,2.66,0.56,2.24,0.56,0.7

f57533,Was this rape ?,"When I (18F) was 16, I was in a (toxic) relationship with a 18M.

It was toxic in many ways but I got over it when I broke up with him. But recently (a few months ago) a close friend of mine told me that it was rape, and I can't wrap my head around that.

We were talking about sex and I ended up telling her that he would be mad at me if i refused sex, that I used to force myself to have sex with him not to be in trouble, and it always hurt like hell and make me ruin the sheets with blood. She told me it was basically rape but I can't be sure, I feel like the problem might have came from me not being happy with him (after the break up, sex didn't hurt) ?

When my friend told me that, it felt like a huge slap in the face and I felt so ashamed but unsure at the same time. I cry every time I talk or think about it and I need to know what it was, if I was just stupid or if there is something else.

f5b59s,I got called a c*nt on valentines day.,"On valentines day my\[30f\] boyfriend\[31m\] asked me to print something out for him the next day and I responded with ""I really dont want to if i'm being honest, but sure i'll do it if you need it"". He looked at me and said ""Wow i'll put this one in the memory bank for later. i'll remember this when I get my money up"". I didnt think my reply was that big of a deal since I didnt want to go all the way to my work office to print something out for him on a Saturday night. I let a few moments go by and I asked him if he was really upset. He then proceeded to say that he would never be allowed to respond to me like that and he would remember this moment later (which I perceived as a slight threat).

I then explained that I thought he was asking me to go to my office and print out his resume - an obvious miscomm on my part. He then started screaming and getting in my face about it telling me I was ridiculous for thinking that and that I should go to a Staples to print it out - even though there is a UPS store right across the street from our apartment. I could tell by the look on his face that he didnt think of that - but he just wanted to keep arguing about it. After trying to explain to him my pov he called me a cunt and then walked away. 

The main pull of his argument was that I dont let him get away with anything and that i'm unsupportive of him - which is not true from my pov. He has been unemployed since August 2019 and has been living off of credit cards ever since while he looks for work. I help him proof his cover letters when he applies for work (he's not a very good writer), I draft all of his thank you emails, along with helping him with timing on follow up notes. I take care of any household items (cleaning supplies, shampoo, soap, deodorant etc) and have bought 95% of all items in our apartment as he wasnt in a good place financially when we moved here.

He is right about me being on him - he is not working full time. He spends 90% of his days at home on the couch applying to jobs and playing video games / watching movies. I feel that if you're home that often its more than fair to have a majority of those cleaning responsibilities lie with you. When i've confronted him about it in the past he agrees and says he'll do better, but then he falls into old habits of putting everything to the side until he feels like it. I am not comfortable living in the level of filth that he is and it bothers me immensely which is no secret as we've been living together for about 3 years, in 3 different apartments.

Anyway - after he called me a cunt (on Valentine's day no less lol) I knew that was the end of this for me. i'm not proud to admit it, but he has a long history with verbal / emotional abuse with me. He's screamed in my face multiple times, has told me that he hopes my ""mother should get raped"", has told me that he hopes I get gangbanged while drunk and has left me in the city by myself several times in the past, among other things that arent coming to mind right now. I come from a line of women who have dealt with abuse from their partners and i'm trying to make a point to not get caught up in that same cycle.

I think the part that bothers me the most is that I know he's telling an alternate version of the story to his family and friends. He has already made a point to move some of his things out of the apartment - which I know is good as our lease is up at the end of next month. I cant help but feel like i've wasted so much time with someone  all for it to end over a literal piece of paper. 

TLDR: My boyfriend is verbally/emotionally abusive, which escalated to a namecalling on valentines day because I said no to printing out a resume for an upcoming job interview. is there something I should have done differently here to avoid this response ? Should I just have said yes to printing it out - if yes how should I be more supportive in future relationships ?",birdbraink,2020-02-17 08:23:40,24,786,49.88,48.47,62.44,32.32,26.2,11.7,93.51,61.07,22.65,15.9,8.65,0.64,0.51,5.98,0.13,6.74,5.09,17.43,9.03,3.56,5.98,2.29,19.47,3.82,2.42,1.4,0.76,2.29,4.96,2.67,2.29,0.38,1.65,0,13.49,0.25,1.02,0.25,6.36,11.96,2.42,1.15,2.42,2.29,1.4,3.82,2.04,0.64,0.89,0.38,1.02,0.38,0.38,0.13,0.13,5.98,2.42,1.02,1.27,1.53,0.25,5.34,10.69,1.53,16.41,1.91,7.51,7,2.42,0.89,1.27,1.02,0,0,0.89,0.25,0.25,0.25,0,0.13,12.21,3.56,1.65,0.13,0,0.25,0,1.02,0.76,2.04,1.02,1.78
f5brkm,Ghosted and drained financially.,"I just know I'll sound like a complete idiot because part of me doesn't want to believe he does this, but also know he does.
My recent ex treats me like absolute garbage. Of course, up until payday (my payday). He then acts sweet until he weasels some cash out of my pocket, and then he ghosts me.
If I even mention anything bad he's done, he blames me completely, and then gives me the silent treatment and tells me everything I say is ""stupid"" when I only mention what I've been dealing with. He cheated several times and expects forgiveness when he hasn't done a thing to earn my forgiveness. And forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting. I never cheated on him, but he cheated constantly and told me if I ever slept with anyone else (even though we had a deadbedroom due to him getting elsewhere) That he'd stop supporting his kids and that I'd be a disgusting slut, but it's okay if he does it. Because he's a guy so it doesn't count. 
I want so bad to cut him out and forget him, but he fake apologizes, which I know is fake because he tells everyone else that I am the bad guy.
We get in an argument, he calls me a dumb b, he waves his hands in my face, and he gives me the silent treatment. Which is hard to handle, because he's conditioned me to react poorly to it whereas in the beginning I'd just walk away, but because he can go weeks ignoring me and not saying a word, it is now a massive trigger. I now have generalized anxiety disorder, and severe panic attacks when dealing with his behaviors. And his friends stand behind him, even though he physically assaulted me right in front of them. They saw him do it, and then blamed me, because I was angry and he was further mocking me and making fun of me ""boo hoo cry a river b***h"". ""blah blah blah eat shit""..
It's like I can't get upset or angry at being belittled daily by him, but he can beat me as he pleases and call me anything he wants even over simply ""turning a cup the wrong direction"". He severely abuses me, and I'm afraid as I'm not sure I can do anything on my own now from being so screwed up.",beanmoon86,2020-02-17 09:03:14,2,404,5.72,45.09,28.4,1,21.26,16.09,93.56,62.38,25.99,20.79,10.64,0.5,0,9.16,0.5,5.2,3.96,9.41,9.65,5.94,12.87,1.98,16.09,4.7,1.73,1.49,0,0.74,10.89,2.23,8.66,0.99,4.21,0.25,16.83,0,0.74,0,9.65,13.12,1.98,2.23,1.73,2.23,1.98,4.7,2.23,0.25,1.24,0.5,2.23,0.99,0.25,0.5,0.5,6.19,0.74,1.24,2.48,0.99,1.24,2.23,12.38,1.73,11.14,0.74,4.95,5.45,1.24,0.25,0,1.24,0,0.5,3.22,1.24,0.74,0.25,0,0.74,18.07,4.95,5.2,0,0,0,0,0,1.98,4.21,0.99,0.74
f5e8xv,Relationship getting worse and worse...time to leave?,"Throwaway cuz he uses Reddit as well. After a long string of toxicity and borderline emotional abuse, I'm this close to leaving my partner. What pushed me over was our argument of the day(which is nearly daily at this point). What was it about? I didn't wanna cuddle him. For 3 and a half hours straight. He never cuddles me, but he made me lay there for several hours, anxious because I'm very fidgety and he wouldn't allow me to move without complaining or getting mad. He says I'm a hypocrite because I wanna cuddle sometimes too. His argument is that I should just lay there and take it because I didn't have anything better to do. I was exhausted, I wanted to sleep! I can't sleep while cuddling, I dunno why but I can't, so I just layed there anxious and exhausted until I passed out. It sounds silly, but I'm very touchy due to abuse prior to our relationship, and it made me feel unsafe because he'd get mad at me every time I would move. It's so stupid and I want out but I don't have anywhere else to go right now. I'm in the process of getting my job back(I was out for surgery), and we have a second bedroom that we've already discussed that he would let me stay in if we broke up(because it's come up in conversation quite a few times with the way things have been going). I'm just gonna work on doing that and cleaning up the room while he's at work and hope for the best.

f5gk48,Toxic Mother,"So I live in a middle classes family where my mother is the bread winner because my father is now too old to work.
Though my mother is the only who works she never wants to give my brother and I any money nor does she want to at for anything. Whenever she has to she becomes aggravated and is verbally abusive.

The last time she gave my younger brother and I money for a trip she was constantly poking me in the face, calling us burdens, and blaming us for any hardship that she has ever faced even when it has nothing to do with us.


I try to ignore her but you can't just do that, she'll be petty and take your things and withhold things from you.

f5layh,I Spent Valentine's Day with the cops (long),"My boyfriend (32M) and I (31F) have been together since June and, due to circumstances, have lived together since October. Things were rocky at first but we've been getting along really well the last couple months- like we finally figured out how to communicate with each other. I have caught myself falling extra hard for him in this time. In the past he had some slip-ups, criticizing me for my weight, having a temper and some jealousy issues, but he says 1000 good things about my body for every one bad thing and had gone a long time without flipping out. He's gotten so angry that he broke dishes twice in the time I've known him. 

On Valentine's Day he took me out and then said something that made me upset when we got home. I went into our room to decompress and figure out my feelings and he couldn't stand it. He thought that meant the night was over and it made him upset so he kept coming in the room and yelling at me/belittling me. I realized I wasn't going to get any peace there so I told him I was going to get a drink and left. He came running out and started pushing my car door like he was trying to break it off. I yelled at him to stop and somehow managed to shut and lock it but my locks are broken so, after pounding on my window, he hopped in the back seat and started trying to break the passenger side headrest. He kept screaming ""WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DO THIS? WHY DID YOU RUIN OUR NIGHT? I SPENT MY LAST DIME TAKING YOU OUT!"" Then I got out of the car and he hopped in the front seat and tore out my windshield wiper lever and headlights lever so that my car wasn't drivable. I saw my upstairs neighbor calling the cops and told him because I just wanted it to stop. He yelled some more stuff about me ruining the night then got in his car and left. 

An officer came and told me I could have him arrested for vandalizing my vehicle which would result in him spending a couple hours in jail and receiving a no-contact order. I needed time to think so I opted to have the cop call him and tell him that if he came back home that night hed be arrested. Even after that I got really anxious every time I heard a car door so I had my aunt pick me up and she let me stay with her. He called me about 15 times and apologized and said he could fix my car. I told him I was done and only had hate in my heart for him. Then the next morning I texted and told him i wasn't home and he could go fix my car if he wanted to. He had it fixed by the afternoon. 

We talked a little bit and he said hes been really stressed out about money and school and he was just pushed to the edge. Hes always studying or working so we rarely get to spend time together and it made him really upset that I shut myself off from him when we finally had a chance to do so. He wasn't thinking straight but hed never hurt me and I dont need to be scared. I told him I had to think and had to go to an appointment, then I left and met up with a domestic violence advocate. In the meantime my aunt had texted me and told me that I need to make sure his gun isn't in the house in case he snaps again. 

Later that night I got a bunch of texts from him asking why my aunt was texting me about his gun and why I was still meeting up with law enforcement. I had left my smartwatch at home and he went in and looked through my texts. (This is not the first time hes done this and after I expressed my boundaries he promised not to do it again.) He told me I was trying to ""bring him down to my drug-addict family's level."" And ""I was just being a bitch because he broke up with me."" My family is not drug addicts, but this isn't the first time hes referred to himself as being better than us. When I got home he told me he had nowhere else to go and I said he could stay on the couch until he finds a place, but that hes a fucking monster and I don't want anything else to do with him. 

Next day (yesterday) he super cleaned the house and got the haircut I've been asking him to get for months. I decided to stay with a friend and hes been texting me saying he hopes I'm comfortable and am able to sleep wherever I am and that I can always come home. 

So, we are in the part of the cycle where hes apologetic and sweet, right? Here is the thing- he is my person. Most of the time he is so good and I can talk to him about everything, but then this monster comes out. We have built a life with our home and our pets, and I'm in a city where I don't have a lot of other community. I just started a new job and he is my stability and support when it feels like everything else is up in the air. People act like it should be so easy to leave after his behavior but there is a serious attachment there. I also was single for 10 years before we met (excluding the occasional long-term fuckboy) and, while I know how to be independent, it has been so nice to not have to be. I've been watching all my friends get married and go on all these great adventures with their SO's, and I finally had that too after wanting it for so long.

I lived back home with my parents and my older brother until I was 24, might have been longer as my family gave me freedom and security. They didn’t care about the pace of other people’s parents put on their kids making them move out of the house as soon as possible. 
Their mentality: finish university, whatever subject would make you happy, find a job after finishing school or during (be productive). And then if I want to I can move out. 
I lived seeing it from perspective in luxury , could buy some nice clothes once in awhile, buy my dear friends nice gifts on their birthdays, help out people who needed help. 

After high school I decided to study nanotechnology (Safe choice. Finding work with that degree I don’t think it would be a problem and I love physics and chemistry), but I always wanted to be an actor so I was preparing while I studying nanotechnology to try to get in ‘Royal school of speech and drama London’ -my true first love. I was proud of myself to be able to go to London and actually auditioning. I didn’t get in, but I felt I did my best. (My young dumbbutt should have tried to a couple of different drama schools, but well, for some reason I didn’t). By then I missed too many classes at the university so I might as well would have to start my whole year over. 

I have had my huge share of depression episodes, lasting months with a month break of seeing things in color, if you know what I mean. That keeps happening to me still to this day, and it started when I was around 14 years old. I could never pin point why am I crying and why am I so unhappy as there is no reason. 

I came back home. Applied for a different university and an easier subject, that was invented especially to fill the gap in the worlds workforce, as there is not enough professionals in that field (I guess as a backup for me) I finished it with good grades even though I barely attended classes, ‘using’ the not going days just sitting at home and trying to figure out what will finally make me happy.

There is so much more I could write, but maybe this is enough to explain my mindset to what happened next.

After I finished my bachelor I managed to get into the best business school in the country to do my masters. It would still be a couple of months before the courses started. 
At this point I have never been in a relationship, never had sex nor was I out of the closet.

I had my fair share of crushes. At the begging only with the opposite sex up to end of middle school (~15yo) when something changed and I started to have very powerful crushed on my guy friends.
I do think I am good looking, I do think I am a smart, Intelligent person and I do care about other people. The only reason I think it never worked out for me I guess is, I become obsessed with the person I like and scared them away. 

Having those few months free before the start of the academic season. I decide to visit a place in which I’ve been twice before already, with a lot of sun and the one in which I felt very happy in, even if I were alone. I also was thinking maybe in a place where homosexuals are not ostracized I will be able to have that vacation fling. Have this ‘first time’ over with.
People do have their vacation flings right?

I arranged everything in a week, told my friends I’m going to Los Angeles. Said goodbye to my family telling them it’s just a month and I’ll be back in no time, didn’t even seem there is a use to wake up my brother to say bye give him a hug as I’ll be back in no time.

So... I had fun, went to different beaches, gay bars, hiked (seen some beautiful views), met few people, felt great. I did promise myself I will not have sex just to have it, if I come back a virgin it’s ok.
Three weeks have passed and I met a guy who I liked, he invited me to his house and I went. Came there on time, sat outside of his apartment building (a very nice one with a swimming pool) waiting for an answer back to be invited in. I sat there with my phone about to die, really needing to pee, so I decided I’ll wait another 20 minutes and I’m going back to the ‘bnb’ I was staying in. 

I was still a smoker, I lit a cigarette, sat down on stairs in front of the house, while listening to some music. Suddenly I see an overweight guy with curly hair with a lot of highlights, I didn’t think he had the pretty face, just not my type.
He came out a car, stopped on the other side of the stairs and took out a cigarette. Kept looking at me once in a while, and I was thinking ‘this is definitely not going to happen’, ‘I am not attracted to you’, ‘do not approach me’, ‘I’m waiting for somebody.’ And yet I might have glanced at him too many times and he came up to me to ask for a lighter.
Since we made a contact I asked him, if the building has a public restroom as I thought it’s usually the case when there is a swimming pool.
He laughed and said, ‘there is nothing like that here, but you can use mine’. I risked it, I went into a nice clean apartment. Used his restroom and was about to get back to waiting outside.
He said I could just wait here and charge my phone while waiting for this guy. He handed me an unopened (so I didn’t have to worry about rape drugs) beer and I sat down on the other side of the couch he was sitting in.
We kind of hit it off. He understood me somehow, even listened to me singing some jazz and actually appreciated it. Spent the whole night talking, there was some kissing. 
Same day he offered to marry me if I want to stay in the USA. I told him that was never the plan and I don’t have to pretend marry him to be in the country nor do I want to risk being accused of fraud. I can finish my masters and legally apply to work anywhere in the world and live on a workers visa. 
I changed my ‘bnb’ place day before I met him, after a night and day spent together he dropped me off by that place. I was getting ready to go to bed when I saw small moving dots just above the bed, googled it and found out there were bedbugs. I called the guy I met on the stairs and asked him if I can stay over for those couple of days I have before flying back to home country.
I packed my stuff and left as quickly as possible. (Dealing with this ‘bnb’ host after that was a whole deal not worth mentioning)

That was the moment I found out he has a female roommate that was gone for a week and she is the one who uses the bedroom and he is sleeping on the couch. It should have been a red flag for me, but those are the beginning of living in the big city I thought. 

The day I moved in we had sex. We then spent those few days before his roommate came back, cuddling, talking, going out. I found myself falling in love with him.
His roommate came back and was fine with me living there as long as I pay some rent. 
I didn’t want to stop seeing him, so I move my flight to be 3 days before I have to start the university. 
After a month living together it felt like it’s perfect and all I need to be happy is here, no matter the circumstances we will help each other and love each other. We started talking about moving somewhere where we can actually close the doors to room. 
I asked him, are you sure you want to marry me? He said he loved me and that he is sure. I rebooked my flight again to right before my visa would end as we didn’t set a date for the wedding yet and I would like not to cut myself from exploring the rest of the USA in the future.

I thought the sooner we get married the faster I can apply for work authorization and we can start building our life’s together. 

We got married, we set up a small gathering in a place with a beautiful view with few of his friends as I didn’t know anybody in LA. Costs of all of my family coming to LA was too high to have them attend the ceremony, and impossible in such a short notice.
I came out to my parents after the second flight reschedule and rest of people I knew in back home just found out from our wedding pictures we posted online.(except few of my close friends) I don’t think I would have done it if I weren’t in love.

Month after the wedding we found a two bedroom apartment and moved with the roommate I mentioned. At that point slowly things started getting worse.

I knew he did cocaine sometimes, now he started doing it more. He barely paid his part of the rent. 
When I found a lawyer to start a green card process he kept telling me he has to work so I kept rescheduling appointments a couple of times. When finally he went with me to see him, he spent most of the time in the buildings restroom, not interested what the lawyer had to say.
He hadn’t paid his taxes for 3 years which were necessary for the process, and he didn’t care to do anything about it.
He kept telling me ‘it’s your problem’.

We started fighting. He kept drinking to a blackout and when he wasn’t blacked out yet or and coked up he kept hitting me, sitting on my chest so I couldn’t move or barely breathed, screaming at me that he loves me, forcing his kisses as a ‘proof’ of it.
Everything seemed to be my fault since there is so many immigrants that work without papers and I should be looking for one and do something, anything. Which theoretically would be fine if I knew how and had a little help.

Before all that started happening I thought I have a healthy approach to loving him filled with trust , but then as time went on and I my confidence slowly dropping I started to be obsessed with. Thinking what did I do wrong, when will he leave, I need to do better. 
He hated when I was crying, never wanted to have sex with me as he kept saying I am a huge turn off for not working or at least cleaning his mess (whenever I did it was never respected and clean within hours became a new mess I didn’t even knew that was possible), my crying made him furious and another turn off.
I couldn’t lock myself in the bathroom and try to cry quietly cause he would burst in or even knocked the door down just to scream at me some more. 
At some point police was called not by me but other tenants in the building. 
Made me rent a car to drive him (he doesn’t have a license) to Palm Springs for his work, as he was going to earn 600$ which seemed that we should still be able to come back with some of it home while having a little vacation. Came back with nothing. He masturbated with someone on a video chat when I was sleeping next to him, and when I woke up during his chat it was my fault for not waking up when he was trying to by grabbing my ass. It may seem nothing to some people, but it made me feel unattractive and almost cheated on?
We met some random sisters around 40ish in a bar in Palm Springs, we found out one of the is capable of find some cocaine, and invited us to a gay bar later that night. She kept buying him drinks and they ended up kissing for a good rest of the night. I decided to get back to the place we’re staying, but I didn’t want to leave him there Wasted. I didn’t want to sit and wait until he would come back wondering what he is doing as I no longer trusted him. I somehow dragged him with difficulty to an Uber, and apparently ‘I should have left him there as he would realize I’m not around and would be getting a car back right away’.(in a pig’s eye).
We came back to the hotel and it was the first time in my life I thought I might get killed. He started chocking me and kissing at the same time. I didn’t know what to do, couldn’t breath and I never thought I can ever hit him back. The only thing I could think of that helped me was, I bit his lip hard enough to make him bleed, which he still mentions to this day as something horrible I did to him.
That is almost two years of marriage with no celebration of any anniversaries and having the worst two birthdays of my life.

We stopped getting along with our roommate 
Probably around the middle of our lease, despite the fact it definitely was problematic for her to hear us fight every other day, but she was stealing money from us and in general behaved very viciously. We had to move to a studio in the same building as we both have no credit and at least this place knew I always paid on time.
I felt it will get better with less stress from the roommate in a clean fresh apartment. And yet another bathroom door was destroyed.
There is much more, but I might as well start a freaking book.

I made him move out, he didn’t pay any rent anyway. He lives in a VERY nice place now and doesn’t have to pay rent. Nobody that knows him, (people I trusted to tell this) believes that such a sweet person like him could do all those things. 

The worst part is I am here, alone I don’t know anybody. Did some part time work that I hate. Nothing makes me happy and I can barely move from my bed. I feel like I am disappointing my family. They would never tell me that though. 
I didn’t tell them how badly it was, and I don’t what to stress them as they are 6 thousand miles away.

I’m writing this as maybe my little step to therapy, and I can always look at those bad memories that I forget all about when I see him.
Pouring it out made me feel a little bit better. 
Maybe some of you can relate.
Maybe somebody will find it interesting.
Maybe you will remember to take care of yourself more than I did
I can write it straight from my bed. 
And hopefully it’s readable.",Logrosik,2020-02-17 23:30:42,1,2697,39.55,37.07,88.41,51.44,20.59,13.13,95.37,60.7,19.84,15.02,9.68,1.11,0.37,3.3,0.56,4.78,5.56,14.94,9.53,6.6,6.6,2.6,21.06,5.52,3.08,1.52,0.96,2.48,5.08,3.23,1.85,0.33,0.37,0.41,10.72,0.74,0.7,0.22,3.49,12.79,2.93,1.11,2,3.41,1.37,3.15,2.04,0.89,0.74,0.37,2.26,0.56,0.59,0.44,0.44,7.82,3.63,1.33,1.56,1.15,0.78,7.79,9.71,1.3,17.72,2.74,8.27,7.71,1.89,1.3,1.74,1.08,0,0.07,0.3,0.07,0.04,0.04,0.11,0.04,12.61,4.86,3.56,0.04,0,0.15,0,0.04,0.52,2.34,1.04,0.07
f5qjbf,Did I go through abuse as a child? (people I asked said I didn't),"Hi all. This question has been in the back of my mind for years now but I only feel comfortable asking it now. As a child, from the ages of 5 to 12 (I'm 16 now), my mum used to beat the shit out of me with whatever she could get her hands on at home. Whenever she'd get angry, she'd beat me.

Upon asking her why she did this to me, she said ""it's because you wouldn't be smart if I didn't do that"". I don't get this statement. Now, she doesn't beat me, but constantly yells at me 24/7.  I reached my limit from one of her screaming sessions a few minutes ago and started having a nose bleed as I was crying.

(As a little side note, she used to force me to sleep with her in the same bed every day, and she even does it now! I'm typing this beside her in bed. Is this weird as well?)

Now, onto the brackets in the title. Everybody I told as a kid, (teachers and friends at school) used to laugh at me and say that it was normal and used to call me a liar. Is this right? 

I seriously doubted myself during that time and I became extremely quiet at school, because I was afraid of getting beaten by my teachers if I said something wrong. It still affects me to this day. (I can't stress this enough).

Basically, did the beatings and humiliation I suffered as a child count as abuse or am I just over-reacting like everyone told me?

No-one in real life took this seriously, so to be honest, I don't expect anyone here to believe me as well, but please know that this true.

Apologies for the lengthy post.",Khanage4567,2020-02-18 03:42:27,14,315,28.53,32.84,62.17,1.33,14.32,11.43,95.24,63.81,23.17,15.56,11.11,0,0.32,4.13,0,7.62,5.08,15.87,8.89,6.98,8.25,2.54,18.1,6.67,3.49,0.95,2.22,0.95,8.25,2.54,5.71,1.27,2.54,0.63,12.06,0.32,0.32,4.44,0,11.75,1.9,3.17,1.59,2.22,1.9,2.86,3.49,0,2.54,0.63,1.9,1.59,0.63,0,0,7.62,0.63,1.59,4.44,1.59,0.63,7.62,9.52,0.32,12.7,0.32,6.35,6.03,1.9,0,0.95,0,0,0,0.95,0.32,0,0,0.63,0,20,5.08,4.76,0,0,1.27,0.32,0.63,0.63,3.81,3.17,0.32

f61h89,story time! the time my father made my sister eat her own throw up,"ok so first off, this particular instance happened when my sister, who we’ll call red, was about 6 years old (she is 18 now). red has aspergers, a form of autism. also we’ll call my father mike (since i feel uncomfortable calling him my father, and also mike is his real name and i really don’t give a fuck about him) (aLso mike is red’s step father).

anyways, red and mike were camping in our backyard. red and mike were roasting marshmallows since red had never had one and she decided she wanted to try one. so, mike got her one and she ate it. but she did not like it at all and promptly vomited it back up. this pissed mike off for whatever reason, so he forced her to pick the vomit up off the ground and eat it again.

over and over he forced this 6 year old little girl to pick up and eat her own vomit off of the ground until she finally kept it down. fuck you, mike.",cicadalad,2020-02-18 15:57:19,10,187,27.29,89.05,23.06,2.39,15.58,9.63,88.24,54.01,19.25,13.9,3.74,1.6,0.53,8.02,0,5.35,3.21,12.83,6.42,8.56,10.16,1.07,16.04,3.21,0.53,1.6,3.74,0.53,4.81,1.07,3.74,0.53,1.6,0,17.65,3.21,0,6.95,4.81,8.56,1.6,4.28,0.53,0.53,1.07,1.07,3.21,2.67,0,0.53,5.35,0.53,1.6,1.07,2.14,9.09,2.67,1.07,4.81,0.53,0,6.42,9.09,1.07,18.72,1.07,9.09,9.09,0,0.53,0.53,0,0,0,2.67,1.6,0,0.53,0,0.53,16.04,5.35,4.81,0,0,0,0.53,0,0,2.14,3.21,0
f63way,Is it abuse?,"I'm in a relationship with someone, and we've been together for a couple years now.  I love him very much.  I do my best to show him I care about him every day.  But I'm thinking that our relationship is very one-sided.  He will really hurt my feelings and make me feel terrible.  He never hugs me, or kisses me, I rarely get to stay the night at his house because he says I keep him up at night by being a noisy sleeper (I have nightmares sometimes), he will barely speak to me for days, but then when he is in the *mood* for company, he will suddenly be very talkative and interested in me.  When I confront him and tell him he is hurting my feelings and making me feel used and sad, he always finds a way to make me feel guilty, he will say things like ""I'm horrible, I dont even know why you love me"" or ""Everyone always leaves me, no one ever gets me"", or he will bring up his ex and how she cheated on him and broke his heart, etc.  So I end up feeling guilty for being like everyone else and forget about my own feelings.  Then he will spend the next two or three days being super sweet and cute with me.  Only to turn around and be cold and distant again. I dont know if this is abuse because, he doesnt hit me or scream at me, but I'm always left feeling confused and sad and up and down like a rollercoaster.   I feel like a little puppet on his strings and he is literally toying with me just because it amuses him. Am I crazy? Or is what I'm feeling real? Is this abuse?

f64xbx,My husband is mentally ill and abusive but I don't think that it is an excuse to treat me the way that he does.,"I am trying to be supportive to my husband. We have been married over twenty years are in our forties. I dated a lot before meeting him and was pretty independent and whole when we started our relationship in our late twenties. We had children after being married for  fifteen years. They were very wanted and we have a very happy little family.

Things are fine until my husband has to do anything that he does not want to do.

Things like dealing with bills or going to the store or cleaning or helping with any major household things.

When it's something I usually try to just handle it and never ask him for help because it is so much easier than asking him and dealing with his tantrum. It's a scary tantrum. He gets really in a rage and says horrible things.

I hold everything in and make sure the kids are not around any of his mood swings.

I realized the other day that I am an enabler.

I am on here because I have no close family nor friends. Everyone I know outside of my marriage is fair weather only, so I just pretend everything is so positive and I act like the most positive person and I just keep it all inside to the point where I even hide my feelings from myself.

I am a shell of what I once was. I am so insulated and withdrawn and I have armor on and walls up all the time. I don't trust my husband at all.

Tonight for example, I realized I forgot to get dish detergent. I woke up super early this morning while everyone is sleeping and I drove to the store and bought food so the kids would have healthy breakfast and lunch items.

I forgot the dish washing liquid.

I went to the emergency room unexpectedly today. I went into the doctor about a virus I have and was sent to the ER because I had some weird things showing up. Ended up being fine, but I texted my husband and on his lunch break he texted me back. He didn't call. He just texted okay glad you are fine.

We had a normal evening and the kids went to sleep and I realized the thing about the dishwasher. I had to have soap because I needed to wash dishes for their lunch and breakfast.

I can't see well driving in the dark and the virus makes me feel very ill still.

My husband yelled at me because I was not well enough to cook dinner. He then asked me why I was so fucking stupid and a time waster to not get soap all day. I reminded him that I was in the ER for hours today. I asked him if he needed to see the note from the doctor that said I should de-stress and rest and heal. I have been seriously ill off and on since September.

Then he told me that I forgot something that I told him, except I didn't forget. He looked at me and made a big deal about me forgetting the soap and then supposedly forgetting this other thing.

This hurts the worst because I watched my parent die of early onset dementia and my parent was my favorite person in the whole world besides my kids.

My husband was there with me as my parent was sick, so he knows what I was experiencing and he knows how scared I am that it will happen to me, so the forgetting comments is to tap into that super fear I have of getting dementia, inheriting it.

I never confide anything anymore to my husband. He uses everything I tell him to hurt me or embarrass me.

He uses the kids to shut me up, like he will say things right before they wake up or say things in another room and then call the kids in so I cannot respond.

He tells me that he hates me every day. He tells me he hopes I die at least once a week. He has punched me really hard last summer. That was because I refused to shut up he said and I wouldn't stop talking. That was because he pissed me off because he called me horrible names and I wasn't just going to sit there and take it. 

He does hate me I think. I really feel like if I did get sick he would be so not there for me in our old age. 

I feel like I am trying to keep my family together and support him through getting help with his rages and his wild mood swings and brooding nature, but it is really difficult. 

He yelled at me so much about going to the store to get the dish washing liquid. 

I find myself giving up on a lot, like having little energy because it takes so much out of me to get up every day and deal with this energy from him and all the negativity. I do though. I get up every day like it's a brand new day and I try to make plans or ask him his ideas or input. He does not care. His ideal day would be to spend time by himself and not with me. He doesn't make plans for family outings. He is a really good dad to the kids, they love him, ge us funny and plays with them and reads to them. 

When I ask him why he doesn't move out of he hates me this much, he says it's because of the kids. I told him custody would be fair and enforced by the court so he has nothing to worry about, but that's all he says every time I ask him to leave and move out. 

I made him an appt to see a psychiatrist and I told him if he doesn't go and make step towards healing that I am moving out. I told him I can't do this any more. 

He thinks he can say and do whatever to me and I will just stay here and take it, but I only did because I know he is ill and I wanted to help him get help and not bail, but the verbal abuse and hitting me last summer was too much, especially using the fear I have over losing my mind against me.",LaughingChicken2020,2020-02-18 20:01:01,1,1103,18.59,44.24,52.64,31.98,17.79,11.51,95.01,63.01,23.93,18.5,11.15,0.91,0.09,5.8,0.54,5.44,4.71,12.06,8.79,5.44,9.7,2.36,20.85,4.08,1.54,0.91,0.45,2.45,6.35,3.26,2.9,0.82,1.27,0.27,15.05,1.72,0.09,0,6.62,12.78,1.54,2.54,1.54,2.63,1.99,3.81,2.27,0.63,0.91,0.63,2.81,0.36,1.18,0.09,1.09,8.16,3.63,1,1.99,1.45,0.54,5.71,12.51,1.18,12.24,1.63,5.62,5.08,0.27,0.54,0.73,0.63,0,0.18,0.63,0.18,0,0.09,0.36,0,8.7,5.62,1.54,0,0,0,0,0.09,0,1.45,0,0

Bad formating, I'm on my phone and my grammar sucks

My mom is somebody that can't take no for an answer. She get angry if you don't do what she says, and if you can't read her steps, she'll yell at you. My parents are split and I live with my dad so I haven't seen much of her because she doesn't call or visit. She was like this in the past and even shows it now, at first when I seen while I'll was at my dad. I thought she grew and realized how she treated me but is was until she did the exact thing she did to me to my brother. It was that I realized that she won't change. She even tried to tell my brother that she use to beat me, and that she'll do that to him if he doesn't do what she wants. She uses the ""it's because I'm your mother"" or ""I raised you"" to get use to tell her things we are not comfortable tell her. She even threatened us with a beating if we anger her to far, or she'll tell me she didn't want to be anger, and ""if you told me thing, I won't have to get mad"". Before, when I was little, I thought these were normal but now I know it's just manipulative.

I'm going to graduate next year, move out and keep myself a distance away from her. I'm worried about my siblings and how when I'm gone, what's gonna happen to them?

f66oxq,Sex addiction (?),"I've been wanting to write about this for a while now, but I couldn't pick the moment or the right words but anyway i'm here now and would like some light, this will probably be long but i hope someone reads it

So, in 2015, I've experienced a sexual abuse, what happened was that a guy i was making a course with was into me and wanted to make out, some friends of mine at the time picked my phone and answered him, they said about doing a lot of dirty stuff that at the time i didn't understand. Out of a slighly pressure of my friends I did meet this guy (Luís) before classes and we kissed a little bit (at that time i have only kissed once) and then he tried to put his hand inside my panties, so i said no and he said: ""why not?"", I gave some excuse like ""there's too much people in here"", he said to meet me after class with i agreed with. After classes we met ánd he said he was going to take me somewhere, turns out ""somewhere"" was the middle of a dead end street and then he press me to a wall and started kissing me and taking my clothes of, with me screaming for him to stop and saying no, which his answered was ""your no sounds so much like a yes to me"", then he started masturbating and put the precum on my mouth for me to taste it (i can't take this scene out of my head till now), and finally when he told me he was going to fuck me, i said i wanted to wait until i was 18 and then push him away and run back to the school, which he came with me, said sorry and that he was gonna wait for me to become 18
When i got home, he me message me asking if i liked it and i said i didn't know it felt good but I didn't wanted all that, i don't remember how but this conversation lead to something like: send me photos of your boobs, i've already seen them anyway and then i send it, many Snapchats, everyday he would ask me that and i was so confused
Other guys come to ask me photos since i was in some groups in whatsapp and as i've sent him already i thought ""well why not"" and then it ran out of control, some guys asked for photos, or videos of myself masturbating and others even blackmailed me for sending more, i didn't even met many of that guys offline, they just came out of no where and got my phone on some site 
I started getting taste to it, i would masturbate 10 times a day, send videos and even bleed, i was miserable, cried everyday and attemped some suicides
One day a guy asked me a photo and then asked how i was, nobody asked that, i told him and ge helped with those blackmails and kinda set me free 
One day I met this guy (João), my first boyfriend but things got weird i really wanted to do sexual things all the fucking time (don't know til now if it was nymphomania), he got sick of it and broke up with me
Moving forward, i was still recovering when i met this guy (Henrique), and he became my second boyfriend, he was into the bdsm and would have sex with me all the time and really rough, i was very hurt and sad, he even rapped me sometimes when i said specifically i didn't want to had sex and he force me to it, most of our encounters i Interpret was another attempt of suicide, but a living one
One day i understood (after 1 year and 6 mo) that relationship was really abusing and end up things with him
Now i'm on a amazing relationship with my best friend in the world and love him so deeply, but i pass through times of no sex drive at all and compulsion, sometimes some scenes with Henrique come to my mind and i cry, or we make a really good sex and i can't stop masturbating or talking about it with him

I don't know what to do, i just want a normal experience and want to be good to him, i don't wanna lose him like i lose João and don't wanna just stop having sex at all

f68uyb,Will it ever get better?,"I feel like I’m on the verge of an anxiety attack or a mental breakdown right now. I think this is what it feels like to be triggered because I was having a normal night but now I can’t stop thinking about my trauma and I just feel…powerless. I feel like I’m stuck in the memories of my trauma, like it’s replaying in my head over and over and this happens sometimes. I feel powerless because I think this still has complete control over my life. At first I was looking just at mental illness memes which admittedly isn’t the best coping mechanism. I saw this bingo card about trauma and PTSD which basically is just a card filled with PTSD symptoms and you’re supposed to fill it out. And I checked off every single box there. Like so many things that I thought were just my personality or my depression or anxiety are actually symptoms of trauma and I never knew this. And my hands are starting to shake because I feel like I’m never going to feel normal, I’m never going to have normal and healthy relationships. I can’t keep any friends or romantic relationships because I’m touch repulsed but also need constant validation, I’m emotionally unstable but somehow also distant and unavailable, I’m always apologising but I also tell myself I don’t care what anyone thinks of me and I have very low self-esteem. Believe it or not I actually thought I was getting better…I mean because I didn’t always hate myself or want to die so much and I think the nightmares about the CSA have finally stopped (it’s been 12 years) and I don’t self-harm anymore. But I feel like tonight I realised that I’ve hardly made any progress at all, just when I thought I was getting better. This still has such a hold on me and I feel like it’s always going to be that way. I hate this. It makes me so mad because I feel like my life is forever going to be harder and it’s permanently tainted and for what? I didn’t do anything wrong but I’m the one who has to deal with the aftermath. I’m sorry, I feel like this talk is really negative and potentially triggering. I don’t really have anywhere else to go because I feel almost like I physically can’t talk to people in my real life about this. I guess my main question is; am I ever going to feel better?

He is not allowed to leave this place. They r trying to get my auntie to sign a slip which makes her not be allowed to touch umar but she will not sign it. Umar's birthday is coming up and still he is stuck in that boarding school. He is 14 now and has still not been able to get away from this bad environment. He has tried to ask his mum if he can call me and my mum so he can talk with people he trusts but still a no. If a child tries to talk to my auntie about adopting him or saying he should leave boarding school, she would say she was busy and would ignore them. I'm trying to text her but I need to not be scared. I feel bad for umar cause he would be a good brother. My grandma and grandpa dont believe us and doesn't care about this situation.

This is lengthy, but I feel like I have been losing my mind and sanity for the last few months. Let me start off by saying that I have never felt this way about somebody before.

I felt like I could be myself without being judged, we would make stupid jokes and laugh with each other all night long, we would stay in and play video games and cuddle for hours.

It would quickly get to the point where I was being called a bad boyfriend, being cussed out, being called names, etc. This obviously wore me out tremendously and after each time she would apologize, but it would just happen again. Over time, I began to sort of just accept that this is the way things are and I lowered the way that I expect to be treated in a relationship and let her walk all over my boundaries. There were several instances that happened that stand out:  

1.  In the first month of dating, we were supposed to hangout on a Friday night. She went with some coworkers to the bar and got too drunk and had to be brought back home passed out. Her coworkers called me and I went to her place to take care of her. She began complaining about things and calling me names and being disrespectful, so I went home. 45 minutes later, I read a barrage of texts claiming how bad of a boyfriend I am to leave her drunk and all alone on a Friday night. She cussed me out. I thought, ""WOW, big red flag here, but our good times have been worth taking this chance and talking to her about it in the morning"" so i went back and we talked about it in the morning and she deeply apologized and said it would never happen again.  

2. We went to a hockey game and had some things to drink. After the game, we got into a silly argument at her apartment and I tried leaving her place. She blocked the door and wouldn't allow me to leave. I was holding chicken wings and the water bottle that she bought me for Christmas. She tried taking her water bottle back and ultimately ended up knocking the chicken wings all over the floor and continued to block the door until I called the police. The police arrived and asked me if I wanted to pres charges and I said no.  

3. We went out drinking again, and got into a small argument on the walk home. She had made fun of something that I had told her that was extremely personal and insinuated that it wasn't a big deal because I am a man and woman have it way worse. She insinuated it was nothing, so I walked her to my car, she got in, and I kicked her out and made her take an Uber home and that I would wait for her Uber to arrive. She wasn't happy. She cussed me out and slammed my door as hard as she could. She had to go back to my house to collect her purse and keys, which I had moved from my room down onto my front porch. I locked the door as I tried going to sleep. I woke up to several text messages and missed phone calls where she is cussing me out and telling me how horrible of a person I am and how she is going to throw everything I had at her house away so I can't get it, including some wiimotes that my Grandma bought me that have sentimental value. She just said, ""that sucks too bad."" Then, I hear pound after pound on my front door. She kicked out the screen on my front door and drove home.  

4. I have a sister who is mentally disabled who I am very protective of. Over memorial day weekend, we got into an argument and she called me a fucking retard straight to my face. She immediately started crying and profusely apologizing.  

I forgave her for all of these things. I am not perfect, either, although I haven't done anything close to this type of stuff. Things started improving little by little, but arguments would still be bad. Anytime I brought a problem up to her she would address it, but not without adding self pity to it. For example, if I told her, ""Hey, I feel like you have been distant lately. Is everything okay?"" She would say something like, ""Yes everything is fine! It's really frustrating though because I feel like no matter what I do you're just going to feel this way and it will never be good enough."" She would always twist it back to her and then I would have to comfort and reassure her of my feelings every time. Any time I brought up an insecurity, it was dismissed and I felt even more insecure about it after rather than better.   

Similarly, any time that I bring up my feelings, they are almost immediately dismissed or flipped around to make me feel like a burden for feeling a certain way. I cannot confront her about anything that is going wrong in the relationship at all, and I always end up feeling worse after I bring it up. I basically have to convince her that she needs to apologize for things that hurt my feelings and he will purposely poke the bear and simply say, ""sorry."" That's usually the best that I can get out of the situation and then it bothers me for days, and if I bring it up again she will essentially tell me to let it go and I'm making a big deal out of nothing.

I know that many of you may be reading this thinking I am an idiot for struggling with the back and forth, but things weren't always bad. Like I said, I had the most amazing times with this woman and I have never felt so closely connected with someone. We could stare at a wall and have fun together. Hours and hours of fun laying in bed, playing video games, texting on the phone, going out and doing activities, going to concerts, etc. She is the only person that I have ever actually felt like I could spend the rest of my life with and never have to second guess my feelings for her. I have some bad arguing tendencies, too, and I picked up on some of those from her when she wasn't able to speak and argue with me like a respectful adult.   

I can't help but feel as though I have been stuck in an abusive relationship emotionally and mentally, but I also can't seem to accept that it and that we need to be separated. Why do I still love someone like this? Was this a bad relationship? Can I just not see this because I'm emotionally blinded by being involved? Someone please tell me there is more to healthy relationships than this. Thanks so much for reading. Someone please knock some sense into me.

TLDR- I think I’m in an abusive relationship and for some reason I am having trouble accepting that this relationship isn’t going to work. I want to continue to try and try and try, even though I know it is not right. We are always getting back together and breaking up due to the same reasons. She will reach back out and give genuine apologies and promise changes, but it inevitably turns sour just days later and she's all talk. I am so physically and mentally exhausting.

This is pertaining to incident 3. But, some of the texts she sent to me while drunk and angry were word for word:

“I’d rather fucking die than be with you”

“Goodnight shit head. Worst person I’ve ever met. Thanks for wasting a year of my life!”

“People like you are the reason we don’t come forward after being raped you piece of shit I can’t believe I thought I loved you”

I have received several more cussing texts and phone calls through our time together as well, but I don't have time to write them all down. Obviously, these are bad and even when I’m emotionally invested in the relationship I can see that.... but I just keep hoping that things will change and there have been signs of improvement but it eventually just goes back to this nonsense. Again, I know I am not perfect and I have my own flaws, but I can only take so much",trueotterwaits,2020-02-19 05:40:30,4,1497,26.86,45.74,78.42,20.69,18.04,13.83,94.05,60.72,20.84,14.3,8.75,1,0.47,3.87,0.2,6.55,4.14,13.49,9.55,6.15,8.48,2.2,20.24,4.01,2.67,0.87,0.6,2.47,6.55,3.07,3.41,0.27,1.47,0.53,12.36,0.13,0.13,4.07,0.27,13.23,2.54,1.34,2,2.61,2.27,3.47,2.87,0.53,0.94,1.27,1.74,0.4,0.47,0.2,0.53,8.82,2.94,1.07,2.47,1.67,1.07,6.28,10.29,1.27,16.83,3.07,7.95,6.75,0.6,1.54,1.2,0.33,0.07,0.13,0.87,0.47,0.07,0.2,0.07,0,12.49,5.14,3.81,0.13,0,0.27,0.2,0.13,1.07,1.74,0,0

f6fu1d,Please help me deal with this awful family situation,"Tried to post this on AITA. Told to re-post here. 

My 30 yo sister Steph, has a long history of abusive relationships. She has been through some of the worst relationships I have ever encountered, and she has not healed from them. To give you some insight, about 5 years ago, she was dating this asshole named Blake. He was physically abusing her, and one night, she called my mom and I to come pick her up in the police station. Blake had thrown her at a chair and she was covered in black and blue marks. At this point, I thought she was never going to see him again. Surprisingly enough she took him back. This caused a HUGE rife in my family and strained my relationship with her for years. Eventually, they broke up, and the entire family moved on. My relationship with Steph began to heal.

Fast forward a few years and she meets this absolute imbecile named Brian. From the start, he was socially off- he would say absurd comments about my father's sexuality, my sister's physical appearance, and was controlling. He refused to let her have her own opinion. Well, they got married 2 years ago. My entire family couldn't stand the guy, but we all made it work because we knew she loved him, and he loved her and that was all that mattered I guess.

Anyway, about a month ago, we find out that Brian had been abusing their 4 week old infant (and their first child together). The baby had huge black and blue marks on his neck, head, and bottom. Of course, my entire family became involved and involved child protective services. Brian was removed from his home and sent to an in-patient facility to “work on his mental health” and my family was stepping up to the plate helping my sister with her infant. Long story short, his insurance stopped paying so he came home. Apparently, my sister is now speaking about wanting her husband back, and not divorcing him. I have another sister, lets call her Joni. Both joni and I are absolutely gutted and disgusted by the very idea that Steph is willing to take back her husband who is not only physically abusive to their child, but emotionally abusive to her. My own parents believe that this was not the first case of child abuse from Blake on their infant. The facts are- I believe Steph will never divorce Brian. I also believe that Brian will abuse the baby again. Unfortunately, my parents refuse to get involved. They won't tell her what to do. Joni and I have told Steph and my parents that Brian is unwelcome at any family event, and Joni has gone as far as saying that Brian is never allowed to be around her children.

AITA for not understanding how she can choose this abusive bipolar asshole over her entire family? AITA for not caring that my relationship with Steph is inevitably going to deteriorate? She has made this decision once before, with Blake. Now, I know that she will do it again, only this time, with the father of her child. I fear that the baby is going to continue to get abused, and will grow up with serious developmental issues.",stevielicks000,2020-02-19 11:24:03,10,560,39.09,92.08,17.35,5.14,15.14,15.36,90.54,53.21,19.46,14.82,5,0.71,0.18,7.5,1.43,4.64,3.39,12.14,8.04,5.18,5.71,1.96,16.43,2.86,0.89,0.54,1.43,2.14,5.36,1.61,3.57,0.36,1.96,0.18,21.96,4.82,0.18,6.07,3.39,9.29,2.32,1.43,0.54,1.07,2.5,1.43,1.61,1.07,0.54,0,2.5,0.71,1.25,0.18,0,12.14,6.25,0.89,3.57,1.07,0.54,6.96,8.39,1.61,14.64,2.5,6.07,6.79,1.25,1.43,1.79,0.36,0,0,1.07,0.36,0.18,0.18,0.18,0.18,14.29,6.07,5.71,0,0,0.36,0,0.71,0.36,0.71,0.36,0

f6iil4,I don’t know if what my boyfriend has said and done to me is considered abuse. I find myself excusing all his behavior and thinking he’s the exception to the rule.,"We’ve been together for 1.5 years. We met at work (we are still coworkers), and we fell in love - hard and fast, before I really knew him that well. A month into our dating, he called me drunk. He went on a cussing rampage, saying “fuck you, bitch,” etc. I was upset but forgave because I figured, he was drunk and he apologized. But this happened a few more times over the phone and also in person, always with alcohol involved. One time it was particularly bad. He was so drunk and at my house, and I felt unsafe. He’s never laid a hand on me, though. This happened 3-4 times. 
He apologized each time but I don’t think it hit him very hard. About a week ago, he called me, drunk. He was 500 miles away, so I was worried he’d drunk drive (which he’s done multiple times, and has a DUI already). I asked him if he was drunk. He denied it but it was obvious. I hung up on him and texted him that his drinking worries me, gives me anxiety because it could be deadly for him and others. I told him I had to take a step back and keep myself safe. He texted me back: fuck you, you’re the definition of a dumb bitch, you’re a piece of shit, you’ve been getting fucked by other men, I have women lined you. He told me to be a woman for once. I never replied. The next morning instead of apologizing he went on a text rant about how he’s lost respect for me, how I’m immature, etc.

He has then been more affectionate, more loving after we talked several times and I said I needed to breakup with him. I feel like he’s reeling me in, slowly but surely, but I feel like I need to be a step ahead. 

Despite the fact that he’s otherwise a very caring and loving person...is everything I’m highlighting considered abusive?
He says what’s abusive is that I keep breaking up with him for drinking, which he doesn’t think is an actual problem (“I can quit whenever I want”).",bundtcake23,2020-02-19 14:21:19,2,393,12.36,76.2,42.38,4.78,14.56,12.98,95.17,60.56,25.95,21.37,9.67,1.53,1.53,8.65,0,4.58,5.09,10.18,11.45,5.34,8.4,1.27,22.65,3.82,1.78,1.78,1.53,2.29,7.12,2.54,4.58,1.02,2.54,0.25,20.87,0,0.25,0.51,9.16,12.21,3.56,1.02,1.78,0.51,2.29,4.07,2.8,0,1.27,1.53,3.82,0.51,0.25,0.76,2.29,8.91,4.07,1.02,2.29,0.51,1.02,10.43,11.2,0.51,12.98,2.29,4.58,7.12,0.51,2.29,0.25,0,0,0,2.04,1.78,0,0,0.25,0,21.63,7.38,6.36,0.25,0,0.25,0,0.51,1.02,4.33,1.53,0

When I was 12 (8 years ago - god I feel old) I had an ICT teacher. He gave off very creepy vibes, and I always tried to dodge him because I really disliked the vibes he was giving off. Anyways, one day he kept me back at break for a reason I couldn’t remember, but he only asked for me so I stayed seated as the rest of my classmates went to their break. This teacher then came behind me and started massaging my shoulders quite intensely whilst we were talking. I can’t remember what we were discussing because I was too freaked out by what was happening. He seemed to enjoy it quite well. I missed my entire 15 break and spent it being massaged by my teacher, but I never ever told another teacher though I desperately wish I had. 
Another incident was when I was having an asthma attack, I used my inhaler but there was a bit of debris in the spout so I started choking, this teacher came up behind me and started rubbing my back in a “not trying to save your life” type way. I went straight to the nurse and was too unnerved to return to his class.

He left a few months later after rumours were going round that he’d made passing comments about a students breasts and touched someone’s leg under the table.

Am I an asshole for not reporting him? I feel bad because if I had reported him it might have gotten some action brought against him to stop this happening to other girls, but I never thought it was a massive problem until I got older. Also, would this be considered abuse? I don’t feel “abused” just a bit creeped out.

f6mwmt,14yo kid in NY is in emotionally and (occasionally) physically abusive household. They rarely have marks. They are anxious about following through with CPS because they doesn't know what to expect. How might CPS respond?,"Hey all, I know that this is a little different from the usual content you get here but I'm hoping to get some insight.

A little backstory:

This person (K) lives in a generally functional NY household (apparently stable situation, no problems with drug abuse, etc), except that the parents habitually belittle them, and occasionally hit them. They have  come to realize that this is abusive, and reached out to their school psychologist, who contacted CPS.

Going home from school that day, K was greatly disturbed to discover that CPS had called their parents' household. K's understanding was that CPS would work with them more discretely to learn more about their situation before outing K to their parents. A caseworker has since come  to visit the house, although nobody has spoken with K yet directly. Their parents are obviously very upset with K and have been pressuring them to lie to the CPS person when they eventually come to speak with K  directly.

What K really wants is for their parents to stop what they're doing, to change, to be better. They hope that CPS could play in a role in catalyzing and assisting that change, but are worried that CPS might over-correct and wind up bringing  more disruption than actual healing. K has no idea how CPS might  respond if they were totally truthful--in their mind it could be anything from ""we can't verify your claim, sorry good luck"" to ""okay we're taking you to live with your (adult) sibling immediately"".

I'm  really hoping that this subreddit could offer some insights regarding the course of action that K could expect CPS to take in response to their learning about K's situation--in theory, but more importantly, in practice.

A little additional information: K has had CPS called on their household twice before when they were &lt;10 years old. They lied to the CPS caseworker at their parents' behest. They are also experiencing severe gender dysphoria, but are punished, silenced, and belittled when they bring it up to their  parents. In addition to their other hopes for their parents, K also hopes that they would be allowed to visit a gender therapist and work through their feelings.

(For the curious, I'm an internet friend of this person who has offered to help K to learn more about what they can expect out of CPS. They don't feel free or safe to look into these things because of their home situation, so I have offered to do the legwork instead.)",DarthLoof,2020-02-19 19:35:53,3,457,56.05,87.24,17.18,33.31,21.76,20.35,87.53,53.83,16.19,9.63,1.09,0.44,0.88,0,7.22,6.56,3.5,15.97,10.07,5.25,5.47,1.31,18.16,3.94,2.19,2.41,0.44,1.75,6.13,3.28,2.84,1.09,1.09,0.22,15.75,1.97,0.22,0,0,16.19,3.28,1.97,3.72,4.16,1.53,3.28,1.53,0.22,0.66,0.44,1.31,0,1.31,0,0,7,2.84,0.88,1.53,1.53,0.66,2.63,12.04,2.63,11.38,2.63,5.03,3.72,2.19,0.22,1.53,0.22,0,0,3.06,0,2.63,2.84,0,0,16.85,4.38,4.6,0.44,0.22,0.22,0,1.09,0.88,2.63,2.19,0.22

* calling me names, even in public
    * whore
    * slut
* hitting me, biting me, chocking me. (sometimes those things can be ok with me but he would do them whenever he wanted)
    * chocking me randomly often when i was not ready/willing
    * hitting me when he found out i was cutting myself
    * biting me after i accidentally bit him/hitting me after i accidentally hit hit him (both times he said i deserved it and that it was only fair, even after i profusely apologized)
    * hurting me until i couldn’t handle it and begged him to stop “because you’re a masochist”
    * slapping me in the face after i told him repeatedly that i didn’t like it, “you like your ass slapped what’s different about your face?”
* completely ignoring an obvious panic attack i was having and trying to get me to do anal while i’m sitting on the floor shaking and crying because he was pressuring me.
* forcing his dick into my mouth
* when i said i didn’t want it he would with turn away from me and sulk, the only way to get him to talk to me is to do what he wants or just leaving immediately.
* going through my phone to “look at instagram memes” i repeatedly caught him looking through my dms or other apps
* pressured me into doing sexual things i want comfortable with:

f6o5ai,Help,"Hi. This is a throwaway account. I just really need to vent. I need to get this out there. I’m going to make it as short as possible, I also wanted to say to any adult/child suffering from verbal/physical/mental/sexual abuse my heart is with you and my messages are always open to talk.

A little background.. I’m 26F. I lived with my two siblings.. (24F) and (28M) and my parents mom 60, dad 59. Middle class. My dad got pneumonia meningitis when he was 45 and my mother attributes that to all of his insane behavior.. 

The furthest memory I have of issues in my home go back to hearing my dad shrieking and screaming and crying at my mom during some fight they had. 
I remember going to school the next day and telling a friend (I was in sixth grade) she laughed at my imitation of my father crying hysterically so I laughed too and I never, ever spoke about what happened in my house again. I also remember my father had bandaged his hand the next day and took me to the side to tell me that my mother had slammed the door on his hans

... I remember constantly waking up to them screaming at each other throughout my adolescence and teens. I figured it was normal. People fight. As soon as I could drive I would take my sister to dinner/lunch/ anywhere but that hell hole when they were fighting. 

My brother became a heroin addict when I was 16. It was a constant battle between my parents as to whether or not they should lock the door at night/let him in/ send him to rehab/ just give up. This was many extreme fights of screaming where I would threaten to call the cops. 


Here are the incidents with my father that will not leave my mind 

1. When I was in high school I saw a therapist for depression. My dad mocked me one night because I had left a light on, he said and I quote “this isn’t your own little fucking party. You have the house lit up like a Christmas tree. You need to see the cookoo doctor we’ll get you the help you need, you’re crazy”...

2. He would often leave the thermostat really high to the point we were all  really really hot. I’m talking 80 degrees. I went to turn it down and he said “if you touch that thermostat I’ll break your fucking arm.”

3. I asked him to turn the TV lower because it was really loud, like always, and I was trying to sleep. He called me a cunt, and continued to do so. Muttering it and walking around. 

4. When I would drive my sister to school he would film me driving away because he believed I was speeding..

There are many others, I just need to know, is this normal or acceptable? I have no normal childhood to compare it to.. anytime I complained to my mother she told me “it could be much worse” and that she was afraid to leave him or didn’t want to.

When I was younger I didn’t drink. I didn’t stay out late. I wasn’t a great student but I literally went to work and came home. Work was my escape, my life line. 

Fast forward, I was 20 and in college. I was finally out of that fucking house. I was going to parties. Making friends (I was always way too embarrassed to bring friends to my home) I met  a wonderful man who was 29. I lied to my mom and said I was staying at university for the week and went to Florida with him. Fast forward two months later, she goes through my email and finds the pictures of us in Florida and tells me i am an idiot and not to come back to the home... fine by me. Got myself an apartment, a job, and haven’t spoken to her or my father since... 

I’m now 26. It’s been 6 years since I’ve seen my mother and father. My mom constantly texts me telling me she loves me and wants to see me. Nothing from my father...
I do miss my mom. But I hold resentment because she’s still with my father. He has fucking destroyed me mentally and she stood by and did nothing and continues to be with him... 

Am I being dramatic? Is this abusive behavior? There’s a bunch of other situations from my life but I know this is insanely long... I just need someone to fucking talk to.",likeididyesterday,2020-02-19 21:15:19,2,777,28.37,37.38,85.26,1.25,12.33,13.38,93.56,58.17,22.01,18.28,13,0.39,1.16,3.22,0.51,3.73,4.12,12.74,9.4,5.28,7.46,1.67,19.31,4.63,1.8,1.29,2.19,1.16,5.53,1.16,4.38,0.39,2.57,0.77,14.41,3.35,0.39,2.45,3.86,10.42,1.42,1.16,2.32,1.67,1.16,3.47,2.96,0.9,1.67,0.39,3.09,0.51,1.16,0.77,0.51,5.92,2.57,0.39,2.06,0.9,0.39,7.98,9.01,1.03,14.93,3.86,6.05,6.18,1.54,0.9,1.29,0.13,0.26,0,1.03,1.03,0,0,0,0,17.5,10.04,1.93,0,0,0.39,0,0,0.77,2.19,1.03,1.16

f6rzbj,the man who raped me repeatedly for 7 years who i moved far away from wants to move to my new town and start going to my new school,"when i was a kid i went through extreme sexual, physical, and emotional abuse at the hands of this man. (i used to always out posts about this on a side account to hide it but honestly whatever. i’m not ashamed of what happened to me anymore and i’m no longer scared he’s gonna find this because if he does he can go die.)

i have cptsd because of what happened to me and i have nightmares about it to this day (it went from age like 3/5 to age 12/13, it’s all kinda fuzzy because i repressed it all for years and years) he raped me 3-4 times a week throughout all those years, beat me, tried to kill me, waterboarded me in the bathtub, mutilated my genitals with knives and sharp objects until i had significant internal damage and external damage, and did a lot of other fucked up shit to me. i won’t get into any more details for anyone else’s sake, i’m sure what i’ve already said so far is enough to make you feel a bit sick. 

he’s my older step brother and when i told our parents he raped me they kicked me out of the house, she 15. to this day my dad, who is my biological dad and not his, spends more time with him than with me, and a large part of my family has disowned me for what i went through. my parents (who i’m sure blame themselves for this happening because they were always at bars and drinking and having parties and not watching us at all growing up) are hiding from what i assume is their guilt but blaming me and  making me feel like it’s all my fault that it happened. 

anyways, i’m 18 now and didn’t want to be in the same town as any of the bullshit i went through or any of my family anymore so a two years ago i packed up and moved away. i moved to a new town, enrolled in a college, got an apartment with my spouse and our cats, and have just been trying to live a normal life and heal. 

my parents still tell my rapist everything i’m doing, where i’m going, where i live, what school i go to, what classes i take, and so on. and he decided that (right after finding out i’m weak from a major surgery too) he wants to move here and start going to the same school as me and live on the same street as me. i feel very unsafe and like i am being followed. he always said if ever he got the chance again he would kill me and i’m scared now that he’s trying to move here but i’m also angry. he doesn’t get to just move in and take away the nice little safe corner of the world i worked so hard to make for myself. if he moves here i’m scared he’ll do something to me while i’m weak and injured. but part of me wants to make sure he feels like he can never move here by telling everyone here who he knows what he did to me. anything to get him to stay away because i genuinely believe he would come and kill me if he got the chance. 

i don’t know what to do, i’m just scared because he’s purposefully moving closer to me when he’s aware i just got a major surgery and am weak and recovering and won’t be able to defend myself when i have to start going back to school because i’ll still be recovering and in pain. and that’s very concerning to me. i don’t feel safe in his vicinity. seeing him is enough to trigger flashbacks. and i’m also kind of scared that if it turns into a physical confrontation like it always did with him he’s going to kill me, unless i can get out my knife in time in which case i fear i’ll kill him if he tries to hurt me. but genuinely i do believe he is much more likely to be able to kill me now than he was back then, he’s much bigger and stronger than he was and even back then he almost killed me multiple times. i had the strength to fight back then, i don’t know if i will anymore, especially not after my surgery. 

i’m sorry if this post is long and disorganized, i tried my best to organize my thoughts clearly but i’m really struggling with all this. i’m just so scared and so angry and tired of living in fear",princejude,2020-02-20 03:51:27,25,808,18.66,22.14,86.43,1,28.86,11.26,95.79,62,23.76,17.82,12.25,0.37,0.12,4.58,0.5,5.94,3.34,14.48,9.65,5.94,10.27,1.61,20.3,6.19,3.09,2.72,1.24,2.35,7.18,1.49,5.69,1.49,2.48,0.25,9.28,1.11,0,0.12,5.2,12.25,2.23,1.73,1.73,3.22,2.35,3.22,1.86,0.25,0.25,1.36,3.71,0.5,2.23,0.87,0.25,6.93,1.36,1.61,2.1,1.36,0.87,4.7,13.24,2.23,16.21,3.47,6.44,6.81,1.11,0.74,0.62,0.25,0,0.99,0.74,0.37,0.25,0,0,0.12,12.87,3.22,3.47,0,0,0,0,0.12,0,4.83,0.99,0.25

My parents are split. Doesn’t really bother me. They both work shift work, and my mom makes me stay at my dads while she’s working at night. He’s an alcoholic. His temper goes from 1-100 real fast, and I’m yelled at and sworn at for expressing an opinion that differs from his, or anything else he can find wrong with me. He usually just yells and threatens me, but he’s occasionally pushed me, grabbed me by the neck, and blocked me/stood over me. I’ve tried telling my mom this but she says to stop instigating and grow up. My mom is very cold to me. She ignores me, berates me, belittles me, calls me names, ect. I have been told on multiple occasions that I will end up on the street, addicted to drugs and pregnant, that I will amount to nothing, that I will throw everything away for a boy and i will be homeless for the rest of my life. The first time I was eight and loved the idea of babies, like other little girls. I told my dad I wanted kids several times, excited to be a young mom and do stuff with them that my parents hadn’t. I was met with the above response. I am told I’m lazy, stupid, a bitch, a fuckwit, a whore, ugly, retarded, selfish, arrogant and more. If I don’t get this verbal. barrage then I am ignored or told that what I have to say doesn’t matter and they don’t want to hear my voice. I’m 13, and ridiculously lonely. I moved to year 8 this year, and my favourite teacher that kind of understood, tho I was careful not to give too much away, hasnt spoken to me. She’s a really friendly person and greets everyone in the halls, but not me. I want to talk to her so bad, just because she actually believes in me, but I don’t feel like I can. My friends know some of the home stuff, but not the physical stuff or the stuff about my mom saying she wants to die to get away from me. They don’t really get it, and I’m glad they don’t experience it. I don’t think I’m that bad a person, but maybe it is my fault, idk.

f6wnz5,Locked in a basement so I can't shower or eat in the kitchen,"Hi Reddit, 

Throwaway so that no one I know sees. 

I have been living in my boyfriend's uncles basement for $200 a week. We have been paying until both of us lost our jobs within weeks of each other. So we fell behind. My boyfriend gets a job and I'm still looking. Right now we are $600 in debt to his uncle. 

So his uncle's bright idea was to lock the house up so we can't shower or eat unless he's home. 

And then he decided ""nah actually I'll lock it from 7 am to 7 pm at night or whenever I get home"" 


I have extreme anxiety around him, he has thrown a christmas tree because he didn't get money from his daughter and kicked her out with her 1 year old. So I'm not willing to take a shower when he's home unless my boyfriend is home and right near the bathroom. 

My boyfriend is at work right now. His uncle is punishing me for not getting a job fast enough (I've been harassing every place I apply to and they all say ""oh we haven't checked yet, or _____ hasn't called us about you get"" so I'm literally out of options. 


He won't let us keep the money we make, we are both on minimum wage jobs, so all we get is the $200-400 and usually we have to pay him more than $200 to make up for not having enough the week before but we always pay back. 


We have no heat in the basement. He doesn't care and took our space heater so we have no warmth. We have a second one but he doesn't know about it. We barely ever use it because it's loud and he would find out. Edit: we live in MA where it's 20-30° outside and it makes this room average 45-60 on a good day


I have no idea what to do. If I call the cops my boyfriend and I will die on the streets because his family SUPPORTS this. 

I sent a text to every single family member. One said I was causing drama, one said ""we don't want you dating our nephew anyway go back to your abusive mom"" and the others don't give a damn.

So it's this or the streets. And having been abused my whole life I can deal with being abused a bit more, but my body isn't taking it well. I've lost 30 pounds in the last 2 weeks because I'm too scared to eat in the kitchen or make food. I didn't shower for a month because I was scared of him screaming at me.",diamondsofdestiny,2020-02-20 09:44:50,3,460,17.72,65.23,63.33,9.66,18.4,9.13,92.61,59.57,19.57,16.3,6.52,4.78,0.65,4.13,0.22,3.26,5.43,11.74,11.52,6.3,9.35,4.35,20.22,2.17,0.87,0.87,4.35,2.83,4.13,1.3,2.61,0.65,1.3,0.43,15.22,2.17,1.09,1.09,5.87,11.74,1.3,2.39,0.65,2.17,1.3,5.65,1.96,0.65,1.09,0.22,2.17,0.22,0.65,0,1.3,10.87,6.96,0.65,0.87,2.39,0,4.35,14.78,0.87,14.35,1.09,8.04,5.87,2.17,1.09,3.26,1.52,0.22,0.22,1.3,0.22,0.43,0,0.43,0.22,16.96,5.22,1.52,0.22,0,0,0,0.65,1.3,5.65,0.22,2.17
f6wpev,i have nothing interesting to say,"Sorry if I spell anything wrong



I have never really liked to talk about my feelings and my problems. It made me feel self-centered and it made me feel like I was looking for attention. I hated being pitted. It has always been "" put everyone else first."" ""care about others instead of yourself"" ""no one wants to hear about your past"". That has always been my thought process. I have now developed PTSD, depression, and anxeity. As far as I know this isn't all this is just the 3 I say most. So on to my abuse story. I had an abusive dad. I don't remeber a lot because I have blocked almost all of it out but it's still there. I'm not sure if I blame him or I blame myself for everytging. He was physically, emotianlly, and mentally abusive. He did drugs and cheated on my mom. He would hit my mom and little brother but I have blocked out most of the times when he hit me. He would yell at us and when we did something he didn't like he either hit, yelled, or threw something at us or at a wall. The last thing I remeber or him is us getting a call that he was arrested. He spent 7 years behind bars for drug abuse. He got married to someone while he was behind bars and now he's out. 7 years are up. Now I have always feared that he was gonna show up one day out of no where but now that he is out that fear has brought me to not sleeping at night. I'm scared of him. 

I don't to share anything else. I'm sorry. I know this isn't the best.

f6wvcb,Is this abuse? My boyfriend (20M) is anxious and giving me (18F) ultimatums about where I live next year,"I previously put this on a relationship subreddit but was told to move to here, and I just want an outsiders perspective as to if this is abuse or not.

So me and my boyfriend are in our second year of university (UK) and have been together almost a year. Over this summer, we were put in a situation where we were both bullied. I protected myself, and my own anxieties, but in doing so, was not there for him and pushed him away. This caused him to develop extreme anxiety and trust issues towards me.

When we came back to university, the anxiety and trust issues were still there. He started off just being anxious about alcohol and partying (paranoid that i would cheat on him). But, in September I went to my girlfriends (who are my flatmates) for advice regarding his behaviour of telling me if I can or can't drink/go out, and following their advice I confronted him about it. We got into an argument and I just gave in to not going out or partying. But because of the advice they gave me, he became convinced that these girls were trying to break us up, and because I am 'easily influenced' I had to stop talking to them. So I wouldn't talk to them about us, I'd tiptoe around my flat so I wouldn't have to see them, because if he found out i'd been talking with them (more than just a quick hello) then he'd get very anxious, which would lead to anger towards me for not respecting what makes him anxious. I tried to explain that avoiding things that make you anxious, when they shouldn't make you anxious, will not help and just make things worse, but he wouldn't hear any of it. So then it continued, one of my best friends cheated on her boyfriend two years ago, but because of that, she was a bad influence and I couldn't be friends with her. I wasn't allowed to goof around with her, have lunch, basically interact at all, because she cheated on her boyfriend two years ago. It continued on like this, and every time I 'fucked-up' as in spoke to this girl, or sat next to my flatmates in the quiet study of the library (aka not talking to them), he would get furious and angry at me and say horrible things. I just started to give in and promised to stop doing whatever it was that made him anxious. To summarise, he is anxious of me being close with anyone, having friends, texting people, going out, joining societies, drinking, basically just doing anything that isn't being with him.

This has continued, and it got a bit better for a few weeks; he'd only ask me who I sat next to in lectures or spoke to once or twice a week instead of everyday. But he started getting really anxious and angry at night over stuff i've done in the past, and he'd call me horrible things and be mean to me. He gets angry over the 'half-truths' i've told him: by this he means the time i forgot to tell him i had a 5 minute coffee with my flatmate (who he'd gave me permission to have coffee with anyway).

Onto the living situation, we were going to live together in the next academic year, but after he was really anxious and angry and horrible to me on multiple occasions, I felt like we were not ready to move in together. He found flatmates, and the only people it made sense for me to go with were my current flatmates. But my boyfriend said that the prospect of that makes him so unhappy and anxious that he'd just break up with me if I lived with them. But I felt more secure living with the girls because our relationship is so unstable and he breaks up with me every other day when he gets anxious, and I feel scared of isolating myself from my only friends in the likely case we will break up if his anxiety does not improve. So he gave me the choice: Live with him or by myself, and have him, or live with the girls and break up.

I just don't know what to do, and if this is abuse. I don't feel secure or happy enough in this relationship to make that commitment (literally sign a contract) to living with him or living by myself (the idea of living alone in a big city scares me), but then i don't want to loose him. So my question is, should I give in and live by myself or with him (even though I don't want to and the thought scares me), or should I live with the girls?

TLDR; My boyfriend is very anxious and doesn't trust me, and is scared of me having friends, being close to anyone, joining societies, being social. I tried to accomodate this anxiety but it isn't working, and it is getting worse. He is scared of me living with 3 girls as they gave me advice about him that lead us to arguing, and he gave me an ultimatum of living with them and not having him, or living myself or with him.",Mobile_Falcon,2020-02-20 09:58:52,2,905,24.26,53.54,62.26,1,27.42,15.25,96.57,64.42,22.54,16.91,8.84,1.33,0.22,5.3,1.22,5.64,3.54,15.8,9.06,5.41,10.5,2.54,19.78,5.3,1.44,1.33,0.99,1.1,7.29,1.88,5.41,2.98,1.77,0.33,16.46,0,1.33,1.33,5.3,12.82,1.99,2.21,2.1,3.09,0.77,5.64,1.44,0.11,0.66,0.55,2.43,0,1.77,0.11,0.66,9.5,4.31,1.33,2.1,1.1,1.33,5.97,8.84,0.99,13.81,1.88,6.41,5.19,1.1,0.77,0,0,0,0,0.33,0.11,0.11,0,0,0.11,15.69,3.31,5.75,0.22,0.22,0.22,0,0.22,0,3.2,2.43,0.11

f6xozb,Am I being dramatic for detaching myself from anyone that engages with my abuser?,"I (25 F) was sexually abused by a classmate for three years from grade 8 to grade 10. It was horrifying but I didn't speak up because he was quite popular and I was this nerdy and overweight person he humiliated all the time. Nobody took me seriously and his friend (F) even said,"" Be happy he's at least touching you. It's the only attention girls like you are going to get from him."" Those three years were miserable and have instilled a fear of intimacy in me. I'm terrified of any form of physical intimacy, never feel safe in crowded places, and whenever someone comes close to me, I recoil in shame/disgust/terror. I don't know. It has taken years of therapy for me to function normally and talk about this without having a panic attack.

Anyway, a few years ago, I finally confronted my abuser and he apologized and said he was a changed man and what not but he continued to tell everyone that I'm just an 'attention-seeking whore'. This was beyond fucked up and it pissed me off so I shared the screenshots of my conversation with him where this dude is begging me to forgive him and turns out, he had done this to multiple girls. Mine was the most extreme case though.

Despite knowing what he did and how he acted, my best friend (M26) keeps asking me to forgive him because he has changed and god would want me to do that. I'm still terrified of my abuser and start showing physical signs of distress when I hear his name. I cannot and will not forgive him. Continuously talking about him has taken a toll on me and I've decided to stop talking to people that make excuses for him, talk to him, are friends with him, or even follow him on social media. I didn't make anyone choose or whatever. I simply stopped interacting with them and ngl, I feel so much better now. My best friend called me out on it and said I was making a big deal out of nothing and was being super dramatic. He said I should chill TF out and get over my trauma already instead of milking the incident so I blocked him.

Am I the asshole for wanting to protect my mental health?

f70f3h,"Abusers ""flipping the switch"" (triggerwarning)","What is this? Do female abusers do this too?

I'm almost out of my 3th abusive relationship with a male (yes I know; I'm getting help for falling for them; and also help by social work/police/etc. getting out of it). 

I went from physical/mentally, rape, now mentally; but all actively trying to avoid me having contact with the outside world. But also all promising me the world.

And all doing the same thing;

It is over now for 5 days. All 3 broke it up with me. At the moment I was seriously doubting to go to the police (but they did not know). 

But what they do then; it feels so weird. These men abusing me, but also really want to marry me.. we have spend 5+ years together..

and the  BAM. I do not only break off the relatioship; you better be gone tommorow or I change all the locks and I don't care if you have to live on the street/burn all your stuff/kill your cat/and I'll take your phone-laptop-medication you can't go without a day or die from you..

wow..wow..wow..dude.

I have understood now you are an abusive partner on my own. You break up. Why do you need to do this extra kick of evil revenche? Like I have cheated with your brother/best friend ánd stole your money ALL at the same time?? I want to leave; NOT planning to stick around =/

Does anyone recognize? And why do they do this? 

I knooow abuse is bad offcourse. A sign of being a dick. But I don't get that.. need..to step it up when THEY break up. There were good moment in those 5 years.. is beating/raping/mentally abusing your partner terrible; yes! But somehow I never see this 100% ""flip on the switch"" coming; that last week still wanting to marry you; next week dumping you and immeadeatly wishing for you to live on the street homeless with acces to nothing.. activaly wishing it not a figure of speech..It often feels like a total 100% lack of respect; where before there were moments of respect between the abuse. 

I do not want to offend anyone with this. Just trying to understand what they are doing. It feels so unreal even when the relationship was abusive.. were the good moments them ""acting good"" then? If they choose that moment for dumping because they don't want to be found out of being abusive; it works counter-productive.. if they would just end the relationship and let me search for a home and let me take my belongings.. no they choose to step it up.

f72u42,I wonder if I have been sexually abused or not,"### Hi everybody, I don’t know if this is the best sub for this so just tell me or redirect me if I’m wrong please.

### So, another « was I abused » post, here we go.

Few years ago I was in a really terribly toxic and long relationship and decided to end it, but I still had to hang up with my ex as we had the same friends. Few weeks later, there was a party at her house and I was invited with all my friends. Now this is where all the issues start: I knew she was still very in love with me, she thretaned to commit suicide many times to make me come back with her, asked me to have sex several time, but I always refused. Knowing this, it was obvious I shouldn't drink to much this night, wich I did. As a teenager who was starting to discover alcohol and didn't know how to deal with it then, and as a sad boy who finished a long relationship in a bad way, I got really really drunk.

I have few memories of what happened so this is going to be a mix of my few memories and what she told me the following day: During the night, as I was passed out on the couch, she woke me up by kissing me. I then rejected her, she continued to insist and I eventually let her kiss me. Then, we did ""foreplay"". I remember me guiding her head for a blowjob, inserting her finger in my anus and asking her to go further (not further in my ass but, you know, furthre in the intercourse)  until a friend surprised us and we stopped. I remember that I could hardly control my owns movements without falling on her or do what I wanted my my hands.

Now, I know that I was hardly conscious and don't remember a lot. I'm not sure I was fully aware of everything that wasn't happening, plus in the morning I found notes on my phones (I always write down notes on my phone when I'm drunk) where I was asking myself if what happened was real or was just a dream.  

So, on one hand I was barely conscious and started by rejecting her, but in the other hand, I kind of ended up by leading things and wanted to go further. I'm not even quite sure how drunk she was. That's why I'm asking, do you think I was abused or not?

This started to affect me only few months ago. At the time when this happened I was in total denial that maybe, this could have been abuse for a lot of different reasons. Plus, when this happened I just had started a new relationship so I didn't feel I had to right feel anything else than guilt for cheating on my new girlfriend. I started to have a new look on this when I talked to people who told me this was abuse instead of ""haha you had a finger in your butt fag"", and since, this really started to affect me.  

So yeah, I would really like to have someone else's opinion on everything to know if I'm worrying over nothing and if this was actual abuse or not. If you think this was not, please be honest, I don't want the opinion of people that will only agree with me.",tropeuhouaiscompte,2020-02-20 16:37:13,1,581,16.18,15.9,98.25,18.18,24.21,13.43,96.73,64.03,22.89,16.18,11.88,0.86,0.86,2.58,0,6.71,4.48,13.08,10.5,7.06,9.12,2.75,20.65,4.13,2.24,2.75,0.17,2.41,4.99,2.24,2.75,0.34,1.2,0.52,9.98,0,0.69,2.58,0.17,17.73,4.13,1.72,2.41,4.48,2.24,6.54,1.72,0.17,0.34,1.2,3.44,1.55,0.34,0.69,0.86,6.2,2.93,0.52,2.07,0.69,0.52,10.5,8.09,1.03,16.18,1.89,6.37,7.92,0.34,1.2,0.34,0,0,0.17,1.2,0.52,0.17,0.34,0,0,15.15,3.79,5.51,0.34,0,0.17,0,0,1.03,2.58,0.69,1.03
f73wvp,"Jesus, I didn't even know that I was being emotionally abused.","When something feels off, something usually IS off. I think I liked this man so much that I constantly overlooked his behavior and thought to myself ""Oh, he's just carrying emotional baggage from his last relationship."" I would work so hard to justify his behavior in my head. I thought it was me and that maybe I was being too sensitive or bringing my feelings and emotions into the mix too early on. 

I found myself Googling ""subtle signs of emotional abuse"" today and was shocked to read that it also involves having your feelings repeatedly dismissed. I was literally going insane trying to get this man to even hear my feelings out. He would become irritated and defensive whenever my feelings related to him in a way that was not ""good."" I was told that I was being illogical, playing the victim, etc. I was called childish for suggesting that I treat him the way that he treats me. He never asked me why I felt my feelings, just immediate defensiveness. I started to question myself and beat myself up over even having feelings and emotions. 

It seemed as if my feelings inconvenienced him and that he had no interest in even acknowledging them. He showed no care or concern for them. I would desperately try to explain why I felt my feelings  in hopes that he would calm down and understand, but that was never successful. I wanted to be with him so badly that I even considered not expressing any negative feelings related to him, out of fear of him getting mad and not wanting me anymore. 

I would express my feelings and somehow everything would be turned around onto me. I would feel forced to defend myself, as the things he was saying about me were not true. My feelings would never really be addressed, and by the end of it all, I was the one apologizing and begging him for forgiveness.

I do not think that he was intentionally trying to abuse me.

f746jt,Confused,"I'm a woman I'm college aged now and when I was 13 I was mildly sexually abused (I don't know how to classify what happend to me I've never told anyone anything beyond some guy trying to grope me a bunch of times) but when I was in 7th grade I sat next to this guy who I considered to be my friend, at some point he started trying to touch me it was innocent at first so I didn't stop it and I didn't really know what to do about it anyway but eventually he would start trying to touch my crotch and I didn't realize at the time but mastrabate (the class would watch a lot of movies and our desks were next to each other in the back so no one knew). That went on for probably like 3 months I would wrap my coat around my legs and put my hands in my lap and stuff but he would still touch me and it went on untill the desks got changed. In the few years afterward it felt kind of gross to think about so I rarely thought about it and I felt like I was guilty. when I was around 17 I realized I didn't really do anything wrong but I started to get super uncomfortable being around basically anyone younger than like 16. Idk if this is common at all ik it is a massive overreaction but being around younger teenagers or kids just makes me feel gross like I'm doing something wrong to them. I know I'm not doing anything wrong to them and I never would but I still feel like im gross or doing something wrong if I'm near them so I avoid being around them as much as I can, if anyone else has had a similar situation or advice I would really appreciate it bc I'm really confused and hate being like this.",throwawayacct111456,2020-02-20 18:19:08,0,324,5.86,3.94,99,1,46.29,10.49,94.75,66.05,23.46,15.74,13.27,0.31,0,0.93,1.23,7.72,3.09,13.89,12.65,10.19,10.49,3.09,21.3,6.17,3.7,2.16,1.85,2.47,5.25,0.93,4.32,1.54,0.62,0,6.17,0,0.93,0.31,1.54,21.6,4.32,1.23,2.78,7.41,0.93,7.72,2.78,0.31,0,2.47,1.23,0.93,0,0.31,0,5.25,0.62,1.54,0.62,0.62,1.85,7.41,8.95,0.31,15.74,1.23,6.17,8.33,1.54,0.31,0,0,0,0,0.93,0,0.62,0,0,0.62,7.41,1.85,0.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.7,1.23,0
f74dl1,The Effects of Abuse,"What would you say the greatest effects abuse has had on your personality are? 

What kinds of skills did you form to deal with the abuse and the trauma it brought?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd probably say that mine would be the darker world view and pessimism, along with a couple eating disorders, depression, anxiety that lasted for a hot minute, the more aggressive approach I tend to have with people, and the understanding I developed of other abuse victims. Outside of that I'm just more suspicious of others.  As far as skill goes I think it would be the training in fighting that I developed and the ability to drop anything that hurts immediately and without hesitation emotionally.

f75752,My brother is abusing his girlfriend.,"I [F14]seriously need some help and advice. I’m not really sure where to start but my older brother who is turning 21 this year is abusing his girlfriend and she, who is 18 won’t leave him, or report it. They also have a baby girl together who is around 6 months old. This all started a few months ago, when my mum told me that when she went to visit them (they live in quite far away) he seemed quite controlling and she seemed scared of him, which I thought wasn’t normal. Anyways, she left it alone but was still very wary and kept in touch with his girlfriend. They text/call daily. One night she texted my mum saying that they were arguing and it got physical and my mum asked if he had ever hit her and she said no, but he had pushed her. Which is no surprise because he had always been controlling and violent, which I’ve experienced firsthand but never thought much of, because siblings fight right? Fast forward to tonight. My mum gets a text from his girlfriend, and she sent her pictures and videos of the marks he left on her face tonight. It looks bad. Like if she were to go out in public people may ask questions. It looked as if he had scratched and or slapped her. Naturally we were very concerned for her but to be honest I was not shocked at all. Sad to say, but thats my brother. My mum constantly told her to leave him, and report this to the police but she claims she loves him and that she does not want to lose custody of her baby. My mum was not really sure what to do because they live in a different country, about an hour away on a plane so theres not much she COULD do right then. She’s currently looking for plane tickets for next month to go visit and try sort this out, because when my she visits, his girlfriend seems to be most at ease when my mum’s around. I keep thinking about this, and how she said that she loves him so she won’t leave him but how can you love someone that clearly doesn’t love you? I just wish she could see this from an outsiders perspective, that he’s clearly manipulating her, he likes the power role, he always has. He’s not a good person. He messed up his own life at an early age, got involved with gangs and stuff, he messed up his own life and along with that he messed up mine, more than he even knows or cares to believe. He’s never changed and I really don’t think he will. I can’t even count anymore how many times we’ve tried to get him help. At this point I don’t care if he goes to jail. He’s probably better off in there anyways. He clearly doesn’t love us or her and its sad but I don’t think I do either. Please, if you have any advice on what me and my mum can do to help it would mean a lot because we are stuck right now. I’ve heard too many stories and I don’t want her to end up in a life threatening situation.

I don't know  as I start writing this if I'm even going to be able to finish, but I'm  going to try because I'd like to be better than I am right now and I'm  going to have to be able to explain what happened.* *So, here it goes...*

You'll  want some background on me I'm sure. I grew up about as average as it  gets in a beach town on the Space Coast of Florida. My parents had  plenty of money and we lived on the beach. They were both each other's  second marriage and they both had kids from previous marriages who were  way (like, 15-20 years) older than me. I was kind of a compromise that  made them feel like they were actually a family and while they'd spend  money on me, it was nothing like they'd spend on themselves. I went to a  good public school and had a lot of friends. I was a cheerleader, on  the swim and track teams, and was popular but not in the most popular  crowd. I would say I was second tier popular. I always had a boyfriend  in high school, but other than occasionally letting a guy get a feel  under my shirt and making out, I didn't do anything. I never gave a  blowjob, never had sex, never even THOUGHT about anal sex, but I didn't  consider myself a prude. I just thought of it as making the guy earn it  and none of them ever earned more than getting a feel of my bra. My bra  was a 34D, because I'm sure you're trying to envision what I looked  like. I was very thin, but muscular, 5'4"", light brown hair that had  been blonde when I was little. I intermittently had bangs, but mostly  just wore my hair down or in a braid.

Nothing  much changed when I went to college, also in Florida. I was on the swim  team and ran recreationally, had a pretty large friend group, but  didn't really find a boyfriend right off. Second semester of sophomore  year, though, I met Jay in a class. He was so smart it was unfair, but  he was also really good looking. I flirted my heart out, and wore some  tops that showed more cleavage than I usually did, and he noticed pretty  quickly and asked me out. I was really hot for him, and even touched  myself down there because I was so excited by him. He felt the same way,  because it wasn't too long before he was wanting to feel me up, and I  let him because of how into him I was. I let him be only the second guy  who got to touch my nipples, and he drove me crazy just by doing that.  He wanted to go further and over the next few days and dates, I let him  get as far as touching me through my panties. Finally, I let him take  them off. I knew he wanted to have sex, but the first few times I  chickened out. I was scared of what losing my virginity would mean, like  did it make me slutty, was he really the one, these kinds of things. He  was really nice and said that he didn't want to push me and that we  could wait. He still fingered me to toe curling, screaming, leaving wet  spots on the bed orgasms. I wasn't as good with him. I tried hand jobs,  but he didn't get off, and he thought blowjobs were gross because I  guess he somehow thought it was degrading to me. I was OK with that  because I thought it was kinda gross myself.

Eventually  though, I did let him take my virginity. He rented an expensive hotel  suite at the beach and took me there and we spent the weekend. Saturday  night after dinner, I got dolled up in this lingerie he'd helped me pick  out, and after foreplay that was unbelievably intense, he got on top of  me. When he entered me, he had to go so slow that I think even after he  finally pushed all the way in beyond my hymen, I was crying in pain and  made him hold still for what seemed like an hour. He was as gentle as  could be, but I was really small and tight and there was nothing that he  could have done differently. It eventually got better, and even that  night I had at least two orgasms, though I was so sore the next day that  we couldn't do it. Over the next few months, we had a decent amount of  sex and he always got me off at least twice.

Junior  year, he helped found a chapter of a fraternity on campus which we'll  call Theta. The guys who came to help found the chapter from the  national office sold it as wanting a diverse group of smart people who  were really upstanding. They recruited 60 guys and Jay was one of them  and on the government council. He was really excited about it thinking  that he could make a fraternity that would be different. It didn't take  long for things to go wrong. A bunch of the brothers started throwing  really rowdy parties, often getting girls drunk and taking advantage of  them. Some of the more conservative brothers left which only diluted  Jay's ability to do anything about it. He didn't want to leave because  he had invested a lot of time and belief in the frat, and his family had  given a big donation to buy a house adjacent to campus and donate it to  the university for the frat.

Eventually  though, things got bad enough by the start of senior year, that Jay  decided to report the frat to the university and try to get the brothers  who were essentially date raping girls kicked out. That was where it  all went bad. The brothers found out, but we didn't know that. Because  he had been elected to a position that he couldn't be removed from  unless he decided to give it up, Jay was on the governing council and  the council had to be at all parties. I always came to be with him. The  brothers announced a party for a Friday night, and as usual, we went.

I  realized immediately that something wasn't right. The music wasn't very  loud, and there was no one there who wasn't a brother. Not even all of  the brothers were there. The president met us at the door and said there  had been a miscommunication about the time and that we should come on  in. He was a big, hulking guy named Pete. His family was worth at least  tens of millions of dollars, and he enjoyed talking about it. He also  enjoyed talking about all of the girls he'd taken advantage of,  especially in front of me. I thought he was disgusting and avoided him  as much as possible.

As we walked  into the large open common area, Pete put his arm around Jay’s neck and  said to him, ""He bud, we're gonna have to talk.""

It  was menacing the way he said it and I had a chill the moment he said  it. As Jay turned to ask what about, Pete punched him with a right hook  that almost knocked Jay out. Immediately several of the other brothers  grabbed Jay by the arms and several others started to punch him all  over. I screamed, but Pete came quickly over to me with several of the  other brothers, pinned my arms, and Pete put one hand over my mouth and  the other on my neck and squeezed.

""Scream again, and I'll break your neck you little bitch,"" he said calmly into my face.

I  didn't doubt that he would, but it was in my nature to fight so I tried  to bite his hand and I kicked wildly, but they were a lot bigger and a  lot stronger than me. Pete's hand went around my neck and squeezed so  hard that I started to feel faint. Just as I was about to pass out, I  looked down at Jay and saw him still trying to fight the other brothers  off, but he was losing badly. How could he not? He was in fabulous shape  from doing triathlons, but it was 5 against one. Then everything went  black.

\*\*\*\*

I  didn't know where I was when I woke up. There were lots of lights  pointed at me, but the rest of the room was dark. I struggled to move,  but I was tied down. First, I thought it was a bed, but then I realized  that they had taken a futon cushion from one of the futons in the big  living room and put it on their pool table. I was downstairs in the  council room which had been a wine cellar before the fraternity had  bought the house. I'd never been here before but Jay had told me about  it. It was where they had their executive council meetings and  fraternity rituals. It was also where they often brought girls who were  less than willing and had been drugged or were too drunk to remember.

I  was also naked. My shredded clothes were in the corner and I started to  weep uncontrollably. I was hyperventilating and probably would have  passed out again if Pete hadn't have slapped me hard across the face.

""Shut up, bitch,"" he growled at me.

I  tried to, but I couldn't stop saying ""no, no, no"" over and over again  and crying. He slapped me again and turned my head away from him. In the  corner was Jay. They had his hands zip-tied and he was obviously dazed  but conscious. I could barely recognize him from all the blood on his  face and everywhere else. They had ripped most of his clothes and he was  on his knees with two of the brothers over him in only his boxers.

As  Pete held my head he spoke to Jay. ""You betrayed this brotherhood Jay,  and now you're going to pay for it. We know you reported us for the  parties. You shouldn’t have done that. Now, whether we get in trouble or  not, we are going to take something from you. We know how into this  little bitch you are and you never even shared her with us. Well, that's  going to change today. We're going to defile every hole she has and  mark her as the property of this fraternity. Now, you can either agree  to this and we will consider letting you back in to the fraternity, or  if you refuse, we will be much rougher. Who knows? We might even hurt  her.""

He started to laugh in what  was the evilest sound I'd ever heard. I was terrified. Every hole? They  intended to have anal sex with me! I couldn't do that. I had only had a  very small thin toy that Jay had bought a few times and even that was  hard for me to take. I hadn't even really enjoyed it, but he was very  turned on by it, so I'd gone along with it.

Pete  kept holding my head over to Jay. Jay's eyes were a picture of fury. He  tried to lunge at the other brothers, but couldn't even stand. They  started to beat him again, kicking him in the groin and stomach. He  opened his mouth and all I could see was blood and missing teeth. I  started to cry again.

Pete slapped  me hard, but this time across my breasts. I yelped in pain and  screamed. ""OK boys, obviously he doesn't give a shit about making this  easier on her. Let's show her how the brothers fuck. It's time for her  to get some real experience.""

I  heard a clanking sound and tried to look down toward my feet. It was  Pete taking down his shorts, his belt buckle clanking as he did. He  pulled out his penis which was only partly hard but still really big. He  was 6 feet tall, maybe a little more, and his penis looked for all the  world to me like it was a yard long, though it was probably only 10  inches and at least 2.5"" wide, which was still way bigger than I'd ever  had. Jay was only 7, and I'd had trouble taking him at first.

Pete looked over at the other brothers who all looked crazed and starving, and I knew it was for me.

""Get your fucking cocks out and let's destroy this fucking bitch,"" he said.

With  that he walked over to my face. ""Put it in your mouth you little bitch.  And if I feel your teeth even once, I will cause you more pain than you  can imagine."" I knew he meant it, but I refused to open my mouth. He  slapped me hard across the face as I felt one of the other brothers try  to spread my legs open. I resisted. Pete reached down to my left nipple  and pinched and twisted so hard that I screamed. That was all he needed.  Before I knew it, his penis was in my mouth and pushing at my throat.

At  the same time, I had lost the fight to keep my legs closed. It was  Bobby who was going to penetrate me. He was an asshole stoner who always  seemed to me like a total idiot. But he was tall and had a cock to  match. I wasn't ready. I wasn't wet, but he pushed forward anyway,  burning and tearing his way into my pussy. I screamed, but only a  sickening gurgling sound came out. Pete took this as his cue to push  deeper with his cock into my throat. Instead of biting it off, I  reflexively opened further as I vomited.

""Fuck  you, you fucking disgusting bitch!"" I heard him scream as he turned my  head to point my vomit onto the floor. He slapped me again as I retched  while Bobby tried to get a rhythm going in my still dry pussy. I think  it almost hurt him as much as me. He pulled out. Was this the end? Maybe  I was so undesirable to them they'd stop.

Wishful  thinking. He spit on my pussy multiple times. ""Fucking useless cunt,  can't even get wet for a good dick,"" I think he said. He'd gotten enough  moisture there to enter me with much less resistance and quickly built a  rhythm fucking me.

Pete gestured  to another brother, Graham, to take his place at my mouth. ""I'm going to  wash this filthy bitch's barf off my dick. Shit burns, bro. Fuck her  face good until I get back. I want her completely broken. Oh, and boys,  make sure Jay gets a good view of things, OK bros?"" Graham was average  size. He opened my mouth and pushed inside. I think at this point I just  kept my mouth open and let him go in and out. He tried to push deeper,  but I kept my throat closed.

Around  this time, I felt Bobby start to go faster. Jay tended to slow down  when he got close to cumming, savoring the feeling he'd say, but Bobby  obviously just wanted to finish. I felt him ramming me harder and harder  making my already sore and burning pussy hurt that much more when he  let out a yell and I felt him jerking and twitching inside me. I pulled  off Graham's dick to say, ""NO!!"", for all the good that would have done  anyway, but Graham slapped me and pulled my head back onto his dick as  Bobby continued to cum. The brothers cheered as Bobby pulled out. He put  his hands up as fists like a champion boxer. A champion rapist was more  like it.

""Hey, good job Bob-O."" I  heard Pete's voice having reentered the room. ""Get Jay up here, I bet  he likes eating her pussy, and let's see how he feels about eating your  jizz, bro."" Jay was barely awake. I could sort of see him as Graham  continued to fuck my face. They dragged him like a zombie and pushed his  face into my swollen pussy, rubbing his face into me as I dripped  Bobby's sperm, getting it all over his face. They dropped him back to  the floor, kicking him a few more times, a few in the head. He was still  after that.

""Dude, dumb idea,  bro."" It was one of the other brothers, Jeremy, I think. ""You're getting  all the blood from his face on her cunt. I don't want to get any shit  he's got, bro.""

""He doesn't have anything, Jer. Think about how straight laced he is, bro,"" Pete said. ""But just to be safe...""

He  picked up a bottle of vodka that they'd been sharing and started to  pour it onto my pussy. Fucking hell, it burned as they washed Jay's  blood off my pussy.

""There, see,  better, right? Although I kinda liked the look. It looked like we'd  popped her cherry, didn't it?” Pete then looked at me. ""You have one  cherry that hasn't been popped, don't you?""

I  knew what he meant but just closed my eyes. Graham was getting close, I  knew it. The head of his cock was swelling like Jay's did when he was  close inside me. Shot after shot went into my mouth, and because I was  on my back, I choked and coughed. Cum flew everywhere. Into my hair,  onto Graham, and around the floor. The brothers laughed.

Jeremy  got up onto the table, and rolled me on top of him. I was like a  rag-doll now, too spent to really resist. He was average sized and  reached around and guided his cock into my pussy. Bobby's cum was  actually helping as a lube. It still hurt, but less. Someone else  stepped up to the table near my head. It was David. He was like Bobby, a  seemingly dumb stoner asshole, but big. He bent my head back and  entered my mouth.

""Stop  tea-bagging me bro!"" I heard Jeremy yell. Apparently, David's balls were  in his face. My head and upper body were jerked to the side to change  the angle so that they could more easily use me.

I  think I just zoned out then. I wanted to be anywhere but my body. I  didn't want to die, but I wanted to be somewhere else. Doing something  else. On a beach with Jay making love gently. He got me so wet and gave  me so many orgasms when we made love. This was my first sexual  experience that wasn't good. I wanted to get away. I don't know how long  it lasted. I was vaguely aware of being turned several times depending  on the whims of the brothers. Every now and then they'd hit me, mostly  in the face, and I would become a little less dazed and do whatever they  asked. Pete told them to break me. They had.

I  was on top again. There was a dick in my mouth again. It was  Christopher. He was about Jay's size. I couldn't even look down to see  who was effortlessly fucking me with a medium sized penis, but there was  so much of their cum in and on me that I almost didn't feel what was  going on. Then I heard Pete's voice.

""Oh  yeah, bitch, it's time for the good stuff."" I felt hands spread my butt  cheeks apart and a finger at the entrance to my ass. I jerked my head  up off the cock in my mouth, suddenly hyper-aware.

""No,  Pete, no please, I can't do that. You're too big. You're a huge manly  man. You're too much for me. Please, I'm begging you."" I guess I thought  I could flatter him into not raping my ass and taking my virginity? I  was an idiot.

He walked around the  table, taking my head into his hands. ""Bitch, I WANT to hurt you. I'm  going to damage you so that you never shit right again."" With that he  slapped me so hard I was dazed for a moment and then pushed my head back  down onto Chris' dick. Then he walked back around behind me.

Someone  was still inside my pussy. It was Jeremy, actually. Pete spit on my  asshole a few times and told Jeremy to stop moving. They both held my  hips as I struggled to frustrate their aim, but I felt Pete's enormous  cock at the entrance of my asshole.

*Oh god, this is it, I thought.*

Pete  slammed forward with a lot of force. Jeremy held me still and after a  moment of really intense pain when I thought it wouldn’t go in and I'd  be saved, I felt a horrible tearing in my anus as Pete penetrated me.  The scream I let out was horrifying even to me. I knew they'd caused  internal damage. Then I realized that I felt Pete's cock spurting into  me. He had cum just from penetrating me.

""Oh  my fucking god. Bro, she made me jizz just getting in. I've never felt  anything that tight. Almost hurts, bro. Tightest little ass I've ever  had.  Even better than those ADPi girls!"" His cock spurted a bit more.  Then he pulled back.

Oh god, the burning pain that caused. I screamed again as he came out.

""Look  boys, anal virgins bleed too!"" Pete seemed proud of himself. I could  feel things dripping. Was it blood or his cum? Was it both? ""Come over  here Graham, get your dick up her butt and enjoy.""

Graham  did exactly that as Jeremy resumed fucking me. The pain was like a  branding iron, fire, something burning the skin of my anus as he fucked  me. I cried and screamed. No matter how much they slapped me, I couldn’t  suck them anymore. My pelvis felt so full from being filled in both  holes and I was in so much pain that I almost passed out. I wanted to.  But I didn't.

I endured Graham  fucking my ass then cumming into me. Christopher then went into my ass  and fucked me until he came almost at the same time Jeremy came into my  pussy. David was last. He entered my ass after they'd lifted me up so  that Pete could get under me. Even after being used so many times, Pete  was so large that I felt like I was having my virginity taken again.  David sawed into my asshole with his dick.

""You  fucking guys tore her asshole up so bad it's looser than her pussy,""  David said. ""Fuck, bitch, clinch your asshole and make me cum up your  ass."" I wouldn't have even if I could, but they tried to make me. I  realized, I couldn't.

Pete slammed his cock into me and held it there. ""Yo Davey, fuck her now, I'll fill her up so she's tighter.""

""Yeah bro, that's better. Thanks. No homo, you know, bro.""

""No homo, bro. Just get off in her so I can mark this bitch's pussy.""

And they did. David eventually came into my ass and Pete into my pussy not long after.

What  happened next, I know mostly from what people have told me later. It  seemed that the brothers moved me and Jay up to his room because that's  where we were found 2 days later. We were both taken to the hospital.  The brothers claimed there must have been a break in. Jay died a few  days later. He had bleeding in the brain so bad that he would have never  recovered. I never got to see him again.

The  ER did a rape kit on me. I eventually heard there were so many  different samples it took weeks for them to identify that I'd been raped  by at least 16 guys. When Pete had entered my butt, he had torn my  sphincter and caused a huge fissure that went all the way to my  perineum. That's the 'taint' where everything connects down there to  give strength to the pelvis. I was going to be incontinent for the rest  of my life. I wore a diaper all the time. But that wasn't the worst  part. All the open tissues got infected. I got really sick and ended up  in the ICU. To make things heal, they decided to give me a colostomy. A  bag. When they were about to do it, they found the worst part: I was  pregnant. Apparently, the pregnancy test they did when I came in was  done too early. It was negative, but it was wrong. I didn't believe in  abortion. I hated killing things, but when I woke up and found out I  begged for an abortion. I wanted it gone. I couldn't stand it. They did  the abortion a few days later. I didn't know who I hate more: them or  me. Actually, I did know. I hated me. Because I didn't even know which  of them's it was.

I spent 59 days  in the hospital. My parents never left. I wouldn't let them. One or the  other or both had to be there at all times. My older sister also came.  We got pretty close. The cops talked to me too. It took several times  for me to finally be able to say what happened. I panicked so bad that  they had to sedate me.

The  brothers did get arrested. But I didn't hold up. I panicked every time I  had to talk about it. It was Peter who got me pregnant. He spent 5  years in jail. The others pleaded down to lesser charges and mostly  spent 2-3 years in jail because I wasn't strong enough to testify. Jay's  murder wasn't even charged.

I  went home and lived with my parents. I never went out of the house.  Never. For anything. I spent almost three years in my room. My parents  would bring food and sometimes sit with me. I almost never talked. I  read sometimes, watched movies sometimes, but I think I mostly just  stared at teh wall.

Eventually my  parents started to push me to do things. They got me a laptop and  encouraged me to find something I could do from my room. I resisted for a  while. But eventually, I got into cyber security. I took all sorts of  classes online and learned how to code, test vulnerabilities, all sorts  of things. My parents saw me coming along and decided to try to get me  out of the house. After 6 years, I left the house for the first time. I  was paler than a sheet of printer paper.

I  still wouldn't go anywhere without both of my parents, and I made my  dad carry his gun all the time. I eventually went to the doctor, and as  bad as things should have been, they really weren't. I needed vitamin D  which you apparently get from the sun, but otherwise my parents had done  a great job taking care of me.

I  started taking contract jobs over the internet and making money. I could  make a lot helping police departments and others. They were initially  really suspicious about not meeting me. Then I would send them articles  about what happened and explain that this was me and I was healing. They  usually didn't give me trouble after that.

I  never thought about anything intimate. Sex, if anything, just brought  back the pain. The physical pain and losing Jay. I missed him. But, I'm  ashamed to say, he faded. I focused on work. I went to the doctor  regularly, and one of the surgeons even asked if I wanted to try  reversing the colostomy. He said I would probably need an artificial  sphincter put in. I wouldn't even let him examine me down there. No man  would ever go back down there with anything for any reason I declared.  He didn't push. He said he understood and respected it. With my  paperwork before I left, there was a hand written note from him.

*Miss Christy,*

*I can't tell you how sorry I am for everything you've been through.* *I apologize if I made you uncomfortable, and I understand why you want no male physicians to examine you.* *If you decide that you want to try to make things more anatomical, go see her.*

*My best wishes for your health,*

*Dr. M*

Paperclipped to the top was a business card. Darrah Smith. A female surgeon who specialized in anorectal surgery.

It's  been 12 years now since it happened. I'm 33 now. I moved out of my  parent's house 2 years ago after my dad bought me several guns and  taught me how to use them. I bought a small, old warehouse and my dad  and his friends spent several months fortifying it. You'd have an easier  time invading the Kremlin. Inside, my office with all of its racks and  other hardware is safe, and the rest of the place is all dolled up in  the domestic way I'd always dreamed I'd have when I was this age. Only  there are no kids. And no husband. It's a fortified warehouse and not a  home on a tree lined street with a white picket fence. I work 18 hours a  day because I don't have much else to do. I make a ton of money, but  what am I going to spend it on?

Except  that I have started to feel urges again. I have a peloton bike, and  about a year ago I was grinding out a sprint when I realized I was  grinding something else too. I was grinding my pelvis, specifically my  clit, right onto the horn of the seat. And I was liking it. I was liking  it a lot. So, I kept going. The sprint on teh screen was over but mine  wasn't. I ground and rubbed through my thin lyrca shorts, and suddenly, I  burst. I had flashed in my eyes, i slumped over the machine and cried  out over and over and over, rhythmically rubbing my clit onto the bike. I  masturbated myself to orgasm at least another half dozen times that  night.

My sexuality had  reawakened. I didn't know how I could possibly go about finding a  partner, but I at least wanted to get my body back. I called Dr. Smith  and made an appointment. The first exam and visit took almost 3 hours as  the whole story flowed out for the first time as I trusted a stranger  for the first time. My mom and sister were in the room. All 3 of them  cried. My dad was outside. I just told the story and asked what she  could do to make things better. She said that she might be able to fix  me down there without having to put in an artificial sphincter. Then  we'd get rid of the colostomy and see if it worked. She said I had to  get therapy and a bunch of other things, because especially if it didn't  work, she was worried. I agreed.

This  story has taken me months to write. It started before I had any  surgeries and I was just starting with my therapist. She agreed that I  was making enough progress to go through with the surgery. It worked. I  won't go into the details, but let's just say my body works the way it  was designed to now. Maybe a bit more pain here and there, but it does.

I  don't know where I'm going from here. How I'll get into a relationship,  or if I will. I doubt I'll ever not carry a gun. Or feel an urge to  draw it when a man who looks like any of the brothers gets too close.  But I am more whole than I've been in a decade.",tamarraharkins,2020-02-20 21:25:49,6,5437,30.23,31.18,77.66,9.33,12.56,11.94,92.55,59.24,21.24,16.04,9.56,0.59,0.92,3.88,1.09,5.19,5.21,13.04,9.16,6.42,7.58,2.04,20.21,4.78,3.03,1.42,1.01,2.5,4.69,1.66,3,0.29,1.32,0.42,10.69,1.14,0.33,0.66,4.49,11.88,2.17,1.34,1.62,2.41,1.42,3.75,3.42,0.75,0.94,1.67,5.46,3.16,1.07,2,0.18,7.67,2.28,1.18,2.3,1.86,0.51,10.24,6.27,1.05,15.58,2.57,8,5.32,1.38,0.57,0.5,0.59,0.11,0.09,2.35,1.75,0.09,0.11,0.13,0.04,17.99,7.93,4.63,0.06,0,0.22,0.13,0.13,1.21,3.02,0.04,0.63
f77ed6,How do you guys temper physical reactions long after you’ve left your abuser?,"Ok, so, I’m long gone from my abusive relationship and went through therapy and am doing way better now for the most part. One thing I’ve noticed though is anytime someone yells at me (even when I absolutely deserve it because I’m not listening or whatever) I immediately start crying and go into panic mode. If the yelling continues I start full-on hyperventilating and end up vomiting almost every time. I’m sure these are panic attacks, my question is...does anybody else have these kinds of intense physical reactions? 

I know I’m safe and I try to calm myself down, but it’s like my body just goes into full panic mode and I can’t control it. And then whoever yelled at me feels like utter shit and I feel like shit and on top of that I feel like I’m being over dramatic because I KNOW there’s no reason for me to be freaking out but I can’t seem to get it under control.

f79ets,how do i talk about it if im not even sure what happened,"i (M18) have unresolved childhood trauma i cant seem to heal from. i dont really know what happened. i have i guess for lack of a better word, snipits of what happened. but im not sure if its my head playing tricks on me or ive blocked these memories out of my head to protect myself from what happened. i cant access these memories but im sick of feeling like i cant breathe whenever somebody is on top of me or touches me in a certain place. 

i just feel so unsafe and start Panicking.

i get a lump in my throat whenever i want to mention it, i just close up and cant say anything. jesus christ it even hurts to talk on here about it. i feel so scared whenever i get into relationships with guys (yes im gay,) and i just distance myself because of how fucking dumb i feel when i struggle to show them affection. 

i read everywhere about men barely getting justice for things that happen to them like abuse or rape. and god i dont think anyone would take me seriously if i one day remembered what happened and put it all together. 

i mentioned to my best friend that something may have happened during my childhood but it never went anywhere from there since i just wasnt sure.

f7b5sj,Help my Spanish exchange student is being abused by her mother (I have to send her back in May😥) what can I do to help her?,"We started hosting a 16 year old girl from Spain in July. We have grown to love and care about her as she was our own daughter. 
A little of our backstory with her in our home. She is a very very shy quiet girl. She’s a good girl gets perfect grades, speaks 4 languages, makes her bed everyday, gets herself ready for school. We have nicknamed her the perfect child. At first she was very quiet and didn’t share much in the way of personal information with us. Always helpful, sweet and clean. 

Then she started to talk to my husband only about personal stuff. Anything from periods to boys. Stuff I would think she would talk to me about. Even shared how she lost her virginity in Spain. My husband immediately told me about it. We contacted our host coordinator and together decided stuff of a sensitive nature needs to be discussed all together as a family. When I asked her why she doesn’t talk to me about those things. She explained that she could never talk to her mother. That her mother would hit her. I blew it off thinking she was referring to spankings. Knowing around the world spankings are still used as punishment. I told her that I would never ever hit her. I made sure she knew that I meant it too. 

Over the months that followed she came to us both for everything. She grew to trust me. All still not making friends, being very shy, apologizing for everything, trying her best to not to inconvenience us for anything, and always trying please us. All just seemed way too perfect. Not normal teen behavior. 

Then last night she dropped a bomb on my husband while I was working. She told him about the abuse she endured with her mother from the age of 9. Everything from being beaten with the tv cable, being punched in the face, being threatened and cut with a knife. As soon as I got home my husband brought me into the conversation. Both of them sharing exactly what was said. I cried and hugged her and didn’t want to let go. She has two little brothers in Spain that the mother abused as well but not as much as her😥I told her there’s NEVER a reason to abuse a kid like that. She told us she’s never told anyone besides her uncle who saw the welts when she was 10years old. He called the cops in Spain. They asked her teachers and didn’t come up with anything😥 never really did a full investigation. She was being isolated in Spain. There was several get togethers planned including her birthday in which her mother would cancel because she had welts and bruises. Her mother reads all her messages and her fathers too. Her father doesn’t know all of the abuse as she’s scared her mother will hurt her or her parents will fight because of it. I made her say out-loud that it was not her fault. She couldn’t say it and mean it. She said it was her fault that her mother never wanted her and was making excuses for the abuse. Saying little things she had done wrong on and on. I said you are a child you are going to make mistakes. I told her I’m not qualified to give advice on what to do next but I would help her to figure out a plan of action.  I also said I wouldn’t tell anyone with out her permission as I want her to trust me but that we have to come up with a plan together. That’s why I’m asking anonymously. 

So what do I do next? I love her too much to send her away to be abused. I believe her because abuse lines up with everything from personality traits to her being very secretive about family dynamics.  I’m her legal guardian only until June. Should I contact CPS? Should I contact my host coordinator to see what rights I have access to? My fear with contacting the host is that word would get back to her mother and make more trouble for her. If I had my way I’d keep her and have her stay with us until she graduates high school (one more year) but she has brothers stuck there and wants to get home to protect them. It feels as though I found out my own children were being abused but in this situation I’m not sure I have any rights. How can I make a difference in her life? Please help any advice is welcome.",thinkpositve,2020-02-21 05:34:46,6,802,23.27,94.73,4.16,18.42,13.37,12.97,94.14,60.72,24.44,18.83,6.23,1.87,0.25,10.1,0.37,5.61,3.74,14.21,9.98,5.99,6.23,2.49,19.95,4.61,2,1.62,0.75,1.87,6.48,2.87,3.37,0.62,1.62,0.5,25.31,2.87,0.37,11.6,1.5,13.47,2.24,2.12,2.49,1.62,3.12,2.49,2,0.25,1.37,0.25,0.75,0.12,0.12,0.12,0.12,11.1,5.24,1.25,2.99,1.5,1.12,7.23,9.6,1.25,12.22,1.75,5.86,4.99,1.25,0.37,0.75,0.25,0,0,0.12,0,0,0,0.12,0,11.47,6.86,1.25,0,0,0.62,0,0.12,0,2.12,0.5,0

f7dndr,Is this abuse?,"My boyfriend and I are trying to make things work really hard, but we have three small children and life is hard and we had kids very young and are trying to work our way out of poverty. But, we both had traumatic childhoods and harbor bad habits from them. 

Last night I was doing homework and asked my boyfriend to put the kids to bed he said no problem. I was writing my essay and finished up about nine o'clock. My oldest daughter, 7, had asked if she could put the baby to bed so I saw her do that from my room. When I got up both the older kids were still awake, the 3-year-old was watching his phone and he was asleep on the couch. I tried to wake him up saying we still needed to eat dinner and the kids were still awake. He didn't get up. He started saying he had a headache. At this point, I'm pretty mad because the kids have school tomorrow, and I asked him if he could handle it. I put the kids to bed, and start putting away dinner. I am complaining and am angry. He gets up starts yelling and throwing the couch cushions and storms into the kitchen. I try to stay calm and ask him to leave the kitchen. He gets in my face and starts calling me a bitch and getting spit all over me. I remain calm, which usually doesn't happen, and he finally leaves. But, then I am so upset and angry I follow after him. (My mistake) and I tell him he needs to leave or I need to take the kids and go because I really don't want to be treated like that anymore. He starts calling me names and telling me I deserved it because of how I treated him and just makes me very frustrated because he keeps twisting everything. I start telling him I hate him, and I hate this and I take my hand and swipe across the shelf where he keeps his DND minis, knowing this will upset him. But then he gets up and starts running toward me and picks me up and slams me on the ground. He does this twice and I blacked out for a min. I start screaming for help and the kids all wake-up and are crying. I got up and took the kids to my mom's. But, now I don't know what to do. I don't have the means to leave, and I really want things to work out. 

Is this abuse or is this just two traumatized people who need counseling? Was this my fault too? Can we still save our relationship after this?",drippy-dreamer,2020-02-21 08:34:51,0,462,18.82,60.26,48.53,1,15.4,10.39,95.45,60.39,22.29,17.97,10.17,1.52,0,6.06,0.22,4.33,4.33,10.39,8.44,4.55,11.47,1.3,22.94,3.25,1.08,1.3,1.3,0.87,5.41,0.87,4.55,0.43,2.16,0.22,15.58,0.65,0.43,0.87,6.06,9.09,0.65,1.73,2.6,1.95,0.65,2.81,2.38,0.43,1.3,0.65,2.81,1.3,0.43,0,1.08,9.52,2.38,1.52,3.03,2.16,0.65,5.19,14.29,0.87,15.8,2.81,6.49,6.71,1.52,0.43,1.95,0.22,0,0,0.22,0.22,0,0,0,0,12.55,5.63,3.25,0,0,0.87,0,0.65,0,1.73,0.43,0
f7fspe,Im a victim of police harassment please help,"Im a college student currently in my senior year, my university allows skateboarding for transportation. I was filming a buddy of mine skating, campus cop came and my friend left because this cop is a known tyrant on campus. He asked for ID, i refused because i wasnt committing a crime. Then he arrested me and threw me in jail. 

He has constantly harassed me when i am with my buddies skating. A previous time before this i was sitting with some buddies and he just rolled up on us and started yelling in our faces saying he was gonna arrest us. We remained calm and he left. 

Another time before that I was with my buddies skating he approached us and told me we could skate the flat ground but not the stairs and ledges i told him i understood. And he left, then some other skaters rolled up and started skating the ledges he came back and started yelling at me, again i wasnt skating the ledges i was just sitting on a bench. He asked for ID i refused because i wasnt committing a crime. I got up from my seat and told him I was leaving since i wasnt doing anything illegal. The officer then tried to grab me to physically detain me. I sat back down on the bench immediately. He then pressed the button on his bodycam. I asked him why he did that, he remained silent. I then asked if i was being detained, he remained silent. I left.

This officer targeted me and premeditated arresting me. I have numerous witnesses to this harassment. Im not trying to talk down on the police...  but this is a tyrannical cop.. i now have been experiencing extreme trauma since my arrest. I was wondering if anyone knew of any resources I could access for my issue.

f7l0c4,An adult living with her abusive family. How do I survive?,"To preface this, I have around until September. I’ll be moving out then. But right now I just can’t take it; the arguing is every day and the abuse won’t stop. My mother and father have both been abusive to me for my entire life, and sadly my brother too has become an abuser. I’m 20, living with my parents. There’s not much I can do. I try to hide in my room all day but they still manage to find ways to trigger me or hurt me. My brother is especially the worst recently, and my parents pinned his behavior on me in a way. Said my mental illness is the reason he’s a dick. The mental illness they’re referring to is me being depressed. Abuse isn’t physical like it was as a kid with me, but now I wish it was. I wish they’d just hit me instead. I’m being pushed over the edge every day with them. I’m scared of what I’ll do.

f7l7b8,Is this considered 'grooming'?,"So, there's this guy that I know from church. He's currently 58M, I'm 26F. I got to know him a little in 2015 because he went to the same house church I still go to. He doesn't go anymore.

So, I'm high functioning autistic and I try really hard to understand boundaries and to respect them, and I actually do pretty well. This guy doesn't.

So, 2018 (he was 56, I was 24), I would go to his house to watch the new episode of a TV show each week. He's divorced, has 2 kids, and they would be there every other week when I was there. Bad Idea, and I'm kinda bad at seeing red flags. I'd be at his house other times on occasion when other people were there. I have this anxiety thing where I do not eat anything, I'll barely drink water at someone's house until I'm really comfortable at their house. He noticed I wouldn't eat anything, and would actually make fun of me for not eating anything.

Between April and August 2018, he would bring up the porn filter he has on his computer, and brought it up about 6 times. I ***NEVER*** said ***ANYTHING*** to provoke him to bring it up or to keep him talking about it, he completely volunteered the information, and would spend the next 5 minutes talking about it while I said absolutely nothing. So, August of 2018, I stopped going to his house because I have sensory issues and every damn time I'd be there, he'd be eating something like lasagna. No big deal, but you mix a noisy food with someone who eats louder than a pig and me with sensory issues, it's a bad mix. So, no explanation, no discussion (because I didn't know how to politely mention it, and it's his house so he can do whatever he wants), I completely cut off contact with him. September of 2018, I was walking into a gas station and I saw this white 2004 Toyota Camry driving straight towards me, and the driver kept hitting the horn all the way from the street (about 50-60 yards). My eyes are terrible and I couldn't tell who it was, so I had this immediate ""This is a psych ward escapee, they're about to attack me"" fear reaction. The car pulls up maybe 6 feet from me and I realize it's Creepy Guy. As he gets out of the car, I walk into the gas station, ready to hide in the bathroom and call the police if he follows me. I hide and watch him, and he stands there like a kicked puppy for a minute before getting back into his car and driving off.

Between September and December 2018, he tries texting me twice. I deleted each text without responding to it. Mid December 2018, he sends me a Facebook friend request. I immediately blocked him and the next day, I texted him asking ""can you please leave me alone?"" He responded with a weirdly worded message saying ""can I trust that since you won't speak to me about what I may have done that you won't speak to anybody else about it?"" I told him I stopped going to his house (I worded it better than this) because he ate like a pig and I couldn't stand the noise, and because he rolled up on me like a psycho at the gas station, and I'd prefer to not interact with him. His final response was to tell me that to show how he means to honor my request, he went on Facebook to make me the first person he has ever tried to unfriend or block, but it looks like I beat him to it, so as soon as he sends this text, he will delete all my contact information from his phone *and* computer. The phone he had at the time did **not** back up to his computer, and the only information that would have been on his computer is info he intentionally put on his computer. I didn't evening know he put any of my information on his computer, or what info he put on his computer.

I feel so violated and nasty for having ever interacted with him, and I feel like I was his prey that he was trying to eventually turn into some sort of sex object.

July 2019, I went to the police and brought up my concerns about this guy.

The church we go to has a north and south parking lot. I've parked in the far north west corner of the north parking lot for years. He parked in the south parking lot, until about 3 weeks ago. Over the past 3 weeks, I've noticed he's been parking within ~20 yards of my van.  9 February, I noticed he was sitting in his car, facing my van when I went to my van. 16 Feb, he parked 6 or 7 spots down on the same row as my van. I know it's probably nothing, but I don't want to risk it being something. I'm 5' nothing, he's 6' something - more than a foot taller than me.

Was this grooming, even though I'm 26 (24/25 at the time)?",SetMySoulFree,2020-02-21 17:15:11,17,883,28.02,47.28,57.9,20.61,20.53,14.27,89.58,59.68,22.76,16.76,8.83,0.11,0.45,7.02,0.34,6,4.98,13.93,9.29,6,7.47,2.49,18.35,3.51,2.38,1.25,3.51,1.36,2.83,1.25,1.59,0.34,0.45,0.11,13.36,0.11,0.79,0,7.47,12.8,2.6,1.59,1.47,3.28,1.47,3.17,2.6,1.13,1.13,0.34,1.59,0.34,0,0.23,1.02,5.78,1.36,0.91,2.27,0.45,1.13,4.87,9.97,1.13,16.08,3.62,6.68,6,1.13,0.79,1.02,0.11,0.34,0,0.57,0.11,0.23,0.11,0.11,0,19.48,4.42,6,0,0,0.45,0,0.23,0.68,4.3,1.13,2.27
f7p3ai,Im in a bed and a room I hardly know,"I escaped my father who physically assaulted me for 3 years. I called the police, who told me because it was his house his rules. They made fun of my disability and told me to just work and get a job if i dont like being gouged cut shoved or hit.

I called 6 people, all of whom refused to have me. It took me calling the cops again for her to consider having me. When I woke up today at 8 Am to her leaving, she told me to figure everything out because she didn’t want me around. She issued an ultimatum of whether I can get 2/3 things

-Underwear and Socks, which I forgot to pack while the police told me to “hurry up and pack your shit”

-My PTSD, Bipolar, Depression, And Anxiety meds

-Or a phone charger, which i dont have because as I said, the police were practically ushering me out

I have 0 dollars in my bank, and she’s issuing ultimatums. I have a friend who is letting me stay at her house in SF, and i’m finally free. Free of abusers and narcissists. I don’t know where i’m going from here, in this room I hardly know

f7ul61,Finding a compromise with trauma?,"This is my first post on reddit so tell me if I’m not doing this right. So to give context, when I was 14-15 I (F 19) dated this girl my age who somehow was alcoholic at that young age. I don’t want to go into it, but she was horribly abusive and I have deep trauma related to drinking. Every time that I’m with friends and they start drinking I have a breakdown, but it’s much much worse when the person I’m dating is drinking, even when I’m not with them. I’m dating an amazing girl right now, she’s kind and caring but drinks with her friends occasionally. We made a compromise that because I’m like this, she offered to drink but not getting totally drunk. However last night she ended up getting totally wasted anyways. I still have horribly anxiety just knowing she’s drinking, but last night I took further steps back from before and when she asked if she could call I told her no because it would be too much, and I went to bed very early so I could sleep through the situation. She told me she completely understand that I didn’t call her. This morning, she texted me that she was upset and angry with me that I wasn’t and couldn’t be there for her last night. She said that all the other girls boyfriends were on call with them and talked to them all night but I wasn’t there for her. For context, we’re somewhat long distance and usually stay on FaceTime constantly throughout the day and she won’t call me today and it’s really hard on me. I’m trying my best to work through my trauma and to obviously not be controlling but it’s so hard.

f7vjug,Not sure if this was abuse?,"I feel it may have just been crossing a boundary but idek if it could even be that, like it may have been totally innocent. I was sexually abused all throughout childhood so I know for a fact I will over interpret things and read into them.

So I went to a doctor appointment for just like a regular check up? Or medicine for something specific? I can't remember, it was few years ago I was like 20. So it was fine I guess I never had him as a doctor before so whatever I was just rolling with it. Anyway he asks me if I'm sexually active,normal, I say yes and 1 partner currently. He says I should get STD test I'm like I recently had one so I'm okay, he's like you never know. I'm like alright maybe... he's like it's important you should do it, more pressuring me about it. I'm like fine ok. Then he's like so have you had a recent breast exam. I was like wellll not really I do self checks though I havent noticed anything. Hes like it's important you should have one. I'm like grimacing and pretty sure I said again I didn't want one but I cant remember for sure so eventually I must have just been like ""ok"". He aas staring at me waiting for my answer, I said yes and he quickly nods his head and like smiles? Nd quickly gets up and brings in a female nurse, who was different than the first nurse who originally saw me before the doc came in, so :/ anyway I am visibly uncomfortable and it feels really unnecessary and the nurse who is in there I THOUGHT picked up on that cause she also looked like kinda confused or whatever kinda frowny. So he has me remove my clothes and lay back, I hate it and I avoid eye contact and I'm blushing, he lingered and touched my nipples, I think regularly but it made me uncomfortable IDK it was probably just normal I know they have to do that. So he's like ""alright you're good."" And I like sit up and I'm pretty sure I get dressed in front of him which I don't like but I dont even remember if I did or not I dont remember him leaving though for me to get dressed. And he basically was done with the appointment after that and the nurse left like right once ue was done examining. He was like you're good to go, and looked at me with a stupid face. Like a gross amused face is the best I can put it. I was like ok thanks.. hes like yep, then he left. And I remember going out to my car and crying and being like ughhhh wtf. I told my mom and she works at that hospital so all she said was like ""yeah that doctor is a creep. I would have told you to see someone else if I knew you were going to see him.""

f7vo6a,My dad's PTSD blew up (Yikes),"I before I start, I'll give some background [23M] UK 
I'm going to provide as much information (Not personal information) as I'm trying to reflect on what happened moments ago.

Today I thought this was going to be healthy day, but when i got back home, he has wrongfully accused me of badmouthing him when clearly he's been badmouthing and making cruel jokes, I only said that I don't need it, that was before we went out while my very unstable Dad stayed at home as always, being a dictator and angry Scumbag.

After shopping and getting back home, he immediately made up some bullsh*t nonsense saying that I said 'his most disliked word'  - Heck - 
I was quite traumatized when I heard his very ugly, unbearable, angry voice, And I thought 

My God he's absolutely NUTS and to make matters worse, he's tone deaf in one ear and admits in using that as an excuse to assume that people are badmouthing him! As if! 
He's a pathological liar and he believes anything he makes up such as others being cocky and being greedy. 

My mum's being a good help and

f7wx4s,Does my wife get an automatic 30 second buffer to vent/talk after I tell her that she needs to stop talking to me and I can't have that conversation?,"[https://ibb.co/xL7F6t1](https://ibb.co/xL7F6t1)

I'm not going to go to the details, but wife (24f) and I (26m) had an argument this morning in which I had quite a short fuse and told my wife that I'm incapable of having a conversation and that she needs to stop talking to me. It was not a topic about money, sex, trust, or another big one. I just couldn't handle talking about it, and I let her know of my boundary of not being able to talk to her. I left the conversation and went to a different room. My wife wasn't done with the conversation and kept talking to me about how I'm being reckless, not responsible, and I don't even know what else. She kept talking for 30 secs - 1 min after I told her I can't talk to her anymore and that she needs to stop talking to me. I also left the room. She didn't stop talking to me, and I unfortunately couldn't control myself anymore and started yelling at from top of my lungs (we were in different rooms and floors) stuff like ""please stop talking to me, I can't handle this, you need to stop"", and she finally stopped talking to me. The text conversation happened over an hour after this incident after I initiated it and tried to solve the conflict by not talking in person. At the end of the text conversation, I had something that was close to a panic attack where I was breathing rapidly (no time between breaths) for over 5 minutes and needed to leave the house. This has not happened to me before.

If I can't handle a conversation, is it reasonable for me to listen to my wife for 30 more seconds? I know I shouldn't have yelled at her. I'm already seeing an individual therapist for depression but my wife doesn't want to go to couples therapy again.",showersareevil,2020-02-22 10:56:03,8,357,48.23,22.48,79.99,8.85,23.8,16.81,91.04,59.66,21.01,15.13,11.2,0.28,0.28,3.36,0,5.88,5.32,15.97,7.84,3.08,5.88,5.04,19.61,3.08,2.8,1.12,1.96,0.56,2.52,0.56,1.96,0.28,1.12,0.28,13.45,1.68,0,5.04,0,10.64,1.4,1.4,2.8,1.12,0,5.32,1.12,0.28,0.84,0,1.68,0.84,0.56,0.28,0,9.52,3.92,1.68,1.96,0.28,2.24,7,9.52,0.28,14.29,1.4,5.32,7.56,0.28,0,1.12,0.28,0,0,0.56,0,0.56,0,0,0,18.21,4.2,3.64,0,0,0.56,0,0.28,0.56,4.2,2.8,1.96
f7yp65,My daughter was sexually abused by father,"A couple of weeks ago the father of my daughter called me and said that someone broke into his apartment and raped our daughter, I was distraught and immediately called my mother to drive me there. We went to the emergency room to secure evidence but the father also told us that she had showered. When I came to his apartment my child was visibly out of it, she stumbled when she walked and it looked like she was drugged, she said that she didnt take something and noone had forced her to take anything. She says that she was bound by her hands, gagged and blindfolded and the assailant held a gun to her head. 

Four weeks later her attorney calls me and says that they have arrested someone in the case and it's her father because they found his fucking semen after the rapekit was done. She says that she doesn't know who attacked her and she has behaved like she normally does and I've talked with psychiatrists that says that it's her way of coping with the situation but now I will have to tell her that the person who did this horrible thing to her was her father.

f80x8i,My friend has been in an abusive relationship for years. I know nobody can convince a person to leave but themselves but any advice?,"This is a throwaway account, since it's all pretty specific.

Normally I'd switch around the genders to make this less identifiable, because  I'm paranoid as all get out, but I think the man being abused by a woman  thing is incredibly relevant and part of why some might not take it so seriously. My friend Ben (30F) has been dating Jana (27?F) for three  years. At some point, she initiated opening up the relationship, so it's  now a poly/open thing. They break up and get back together maybe two to  three times a week, and that's being optimistic.

This  is where it gets kind of complicated, and I'm not trying to bury the lede, so I'll fess up: I have feelings for this guy and it's mutual to  at least a point. We hooked up when I (stupidly) thought he was done  with his relationship, and I've since told him I can't do that anymore  as I don't want to enable his complacency by being a distraction (I said  it nicer than this, promise). I've told him I can't be in an open thing  (just don't think I could handle it personally) and certainly can't involve myself in something so toxic.

I don't even know if he acknowledges that it's abuse, which will probably  be something I ask next time we see each other. ""Acknowledges what as  abuse?"" you may ask. Well, strangers:

* She's laid her hands on him multiple times. I don't know to what extent, he didn't want to talk about it, and I won't push.
* She's pushed him out of a stationary vehicle.
* Constant  streams of ""I never loved you,"" ""I don't want you anymore,"" ""I don't  find you sexually attractive,"" et cetera. I've seen a little of it, he's  shown me his phone and told me the general themes of the verbal abuse.  Haven't been there for it, but she supposedly blows up and yells.
* Consistently makes plans and bails or kicks him out when he shows up.
* In  this open relationship, and I'm going to be super careful because I  know I'll sound biased, she is able to have boyfriends and fuck around  for lack of a better word. Hell, she tried to pursue me before he ever  did. He is not allowed to do any of this with anybody--a few months back  I went to hang out and watch a game with him at a bar, and before I  left she asked if I was going and decided she wouldn't go if I was  there. Instead of going, whatever she was saying had him on his phone  freaking for the entirety of the night. We talked for a bit and he  decided to drop me back at mine and go see her.
* As  backup to the manipulative nature of all this, when we were still  talking and I didn't know the nature of their relationship, she told me  that he'd never had a long-term partner who supported him like she did,  so it's hard for him to let her go. Hindsight says ""Aight.""

Rinse  and repeat. He's said he wants to make it work, he wants to stay  friends with her (when I expressed doubt he said he's stayed friends  with exes before--I asked if they treated him how she does). I feel like  he knows what he needs to do, but doesn't want to admit it? He even  said the other day that he feels like the only reason she has anything  to do with him is because she knows he'll be there no matter what she  does. I agreed.

It gets more  egregious and I don't think it'll ever stop at this point. He says it's  been like this for the last year and a half, but mutual friends say it's  been more like the entirety of the relationship. The relationship  dynamics are apparently so well known in this circle of friends that  when I've started explaining my involvement I've been warned not to be  involved (clearly I listened very well).

It  hurts a lot to watch it happen over and over. I'll never not be there,  and I'm not investing a disproportionate amount of emotional energy on  this (I'm in therapy and my therapist knows). Despite my feelings for  him, I could care less if he ever sees me romantically again as long as  he's safe and happy, and I just don't think that that's possible with  Jana.

I know you can't make  someone leave a relationship. Only they can do that. I'm just wondering  if there's anything I can do to be a good friend (besides listening and  not hooking up with Ben lol), for anyone who's been in a similar  situation to him or me.

I'm just very confused. I ask him to not yell or swear at me when we are in a disagreement, and it very rarely helps.

I have a very hard time closing J out, finishing with J, hanging up the ""closed"" sign and walking out the door--you know the drill.  But I've done so.  The devices and tricks J has used to get me to ""come back"" are ingenious.  He's remembered apps I never use and have failed to block him on, and wheedled, ""Oh, c'mon, can we not be friends?""  And I've softened, said we could be friends, and then the cold/ice-cold/abuse-freezer treatment begins again.

Around Christmas I'd totally had it, so I sent via certified mail a cease and desist letter to J and everyone around him (I'm a lawyer and did it right), warning that if there were further contact I'd get a harrassment prevention order.  

Two months went by.  Then I got a plaintive call from J, who was in a psych ward.  He was very well-behaved.  He respected boundaries: Can we please just not close the door entirely.  Hmm, maybe, I said.  Okay, bye. 

A month passed.  Then I received probably the sweetest and touching piece of mail I've ever received, ever (I'm almost fifty.)  It was a postcard J had made, probably in occupational therapy.  It listed a cloud of words and expressions, all in different colors, all mentioning either things I'd said, or happy memories we'd had, or sometimes just interjections--but all were evocative, and sweet, and it was very lovely to see, from this ""semantic cloud,"" that J seemed to regard our past as not entirely wretched.

It's been two months.  I'm wanting, craving, another communication from J.  I know, I *know* that that way lies disaster.  I know that I must be me and continue with my life independent of J and his communications, or his silences.  I must terminate their power over me.

She had a lot of childhood trauma growing up to now. She would always come to me when there's an issue with her family or emotions. It became to the point where I tried to help her she would feel bad and puts me down for trying to help her. I had to be careful when I talk to her or she would get triggered and talk about how I wasn't open minded and I hurt her. When we fought she couldn't admit she was wrong or wanted to take responsibility so to make her feel better I would take all the blame. One day I told her I wanted a break she was worried we wasn't gonna be close anymore. A few months later I talked to her again and things were fine but we were fight again and again. It gotten to the point where I felt like I was hurting her and I was a useless piece of shit so I blocked her. Since then Im afraid what my friends really think of me or thinking are they really friends with me. A week ago she was talking shit about me about me but some of my friends called her out on it. She dm'd me apologizing for all that happened and wanted to know what she did wrong. I just went off and told her how much she hurt me with tears falling from my face. She tried to tell me she was in a point in her life where she didnt care and she had nothing to lose and then she asked if we could be friends again. I told her her trauma wasn't an excuse for hurting me like that.

I have plans with two of my best friends to run away after I graduate high school and we'd all get an apartment together, split then rent 'n utilities and stuff. One of whom already lives in the city we're running to is already looking at apartments, and found a really nice one that's relatively cheap for all 3 of us. I'm trying to get my parents to put my car in my name so I can take it with me and they can't call the cops on me for stealing the car. 

But am I an asshole for doing this? Planning on just up and running away one day and cutting them out of my life, hopefully permanently? I'm so afraid that they'll somehow manipulate me into staying with them or that they were never abusive to me in the first place and I'm just a vindictive asshole blowing this whole situation out of proportion. Does anyone have any advice for running away or just anything to make me feel like less of a guilty shitstain?",8bitpluto,2020-02-22 19:55:19,2,306,45.45,9.57,99,3.67,20.4,15.36,94.44,63.07,19.93,15.36,12.09,0.98,0,0,2.29,4.58,4.58,18.95,10.13,6.54,7.52,1.96,19.93,3.27,1.96,0.98,3.59,2.29,5.56,1.63,3.92,0.65,2.61,0,6.54,0.65,0.33,0,0,12.75,1.63,1.31,1.31,4.25,0.98,4.9,0.65,0.33,0,0.33,2.94,1.63,1.31,0,0,8.5,2.29,2.29,2.61,1.96,0,3.92,13.73,1.96,17.65,4.25,8.17,5.56,1.31,0.98,1.31,0.98,0,0,1.63,1.63,0,0,0,0,13.07,3.59,1.96,0,0,1.31,0,0,0,5.56,0.65,0
f86f9y,I have no idea what to do.,"Mods: Please remove if this is not acceptable for this sub. My intention is not to have a net negative effect here.

I've made a lot of mistakes. I have been the victim of domestic violence and I have been the person committing the abuse. I had a lot of childhood abuse that was never properly addressed and remediated with therapy. and as a result I developed dysfunctional and hurtful tendencies. Not to be construed in any way shape or form to be considered an excuse. I take full responsibility for what I did. I say this to add context. Medication has pretty much eliminated my compulsive tendencies.

I hurt my wife very badly in many different ways. I know that I am not the victim in this situation. I regret what I did and I have made solid changes to who I am to make myself a better person and make sure this never happens again. It got so bad to the point that she left and we've been in limbo ever since (planning on divorce).

I know she doesn't need me, we left things open as far as what was going to happen socially (we haven't engaged in anything social yet). about a month after we separated, I got on medication and I've been adding more medications and have seen amazing success with it. I can see how incredibly unbalanced I was and I never want to become that again.

I have been doing a very intense round of therapy with sometimes being as much as 3x a week.

My therapist thinks that I am at a point that it would be beneficial for me and potentially for her, if I floated the idea to her of bringing her in either to therapy or just by ourselves so I can have the opportunity to apologize to her.

My intention is to give her the option to hear my apology. Apparently for some that can have a very powerful impact on their healing. The goal being to give her anything and everything I can to try and help clean up the mess I made and help her in whatever way I can. Like I said, I know she doesn't need me, but maybe it would be useful to her.

How do I float this idea:  
1. Without just dumping a whole bunch of an emotional mess all over the place in a long text.

2. Remain respectful of her wishes (reminder, we left things open so presumably it would be okay to ask)

Perhaps anything else I'm failing to consider?

I've realized that I know this isn't a granted, I just wanted to approach this in the best way possible.

Please know, I don't take any of this lightly and I absolutely have learned from my mistakes and vow never to commit them again. I don't ever want to go back to the old me. So, please be gentle because I am a work in progress.",ThisDesigner8,2020-02-22 23:37:41,0,504,27.87,21.95,63.15,29.08,15.75,15.87,93.45,62.5,21.03,14.29,10.32,1.19,0,2.38,0.4,6.75,5.75,13.69,11.9,5.75,6.55,3.37,19.84,3.77,2.38,1.59,0.4,2.98,6.94,3.57,3.37,0,0.4,0.79,7.94,0.4,0,2.58,0,17.26,3.37,2.78,2.78,4.17,2.38,3.17,1.59,0.6,0.6,0.6,1.59,0,1.59,0,0,7.54,2.18,2.38,2.38,2.38,0.4,4.96,14.29,0.79,11.31,1.39,6.55,3.57,1.39,0,0.2,0,0,0,0.4,0,0,0.4,0,0,11.9,6.15,1.79,0.4,0,0.2,0,0,0,2.18,1.19,0

f871b3,My dad(m59) told me(m19) his drinking helped situations.,"*my first post, on mobile bluh blah bleh. Some rough stuff is mentioned fair warning ⚠️  don't want to provoke anyone. 

I have a lot going on rn and kind of just needed to let it all out so I had to explain a lot of the backstory. Sorry bout that. 

My father was 1% father and 99% abusive, alcoholic, manipulative, lying, deceiving, gambling coward that lived in the same house as me until I was 9. He loved using a car belt to whip me until my back and buttocks were bleeding while he drunkenly yelled stop hitting yourself.  He got away with all of it. He never laid a finger on my mom but would hurl slurs at her and at her kids from a previous marriage. Once, kicking them down the stairs and making me watch.  Then after he verbally abused my mom, he would kick them out with no purse or keys and start punishing me.  

He and my mom would make a combined 60k a year, he gambled every single paycheck and half of my mom's every time, the food bank volunteers knew us by name.   He cowardly decided to try and kill himself by CO2 poisoning while I was in the next room.  Then almost succeeding and ended up in a coma, I saw him dying, a tube down his throat.  Age 9. My mom separating him after this but never divorcing since in her religion,  you can only divorce if the other cheats on you.  

All of this psychological, physical, and emotional abuse and I still somehow trusted and believed in him. 

Once he learnt how to speak and walk again from all the damage he caused, he did rehab for two years. He relapsed way too many times to count.  Yet he always tells me I’m the only reason he’s living right now. So I felt like if I didn’t want to see him, he would kill himself. He manipulated my whole life practically.  

But he stopped drinking roughly 2 years ago, switching to cannabis.  I saw a difference in him, he was showering daily, he lost all his fat and got into shape at almost 60 years old, and seemed more content. 

Today we went for supper and he told me he was going to divorce my mom. Ok cool. So? I knew you guys would never get back together. Ever. I just see you two as being divorced already.  But then he tells me he’s moving to the Philippines since he can retire, collect his pension and live a nicer life there.  It makes sense but after all of this?  After I did 10 years of therapy, 9 hospitalizations, 5 suicide attempts and he’s just going to leave me just like that?  

So I look past all that and I just want him to be happy. Who cares about what I went through, it’s life. I don’t blame him for what he did, his father was 100x worse to him and my father didn’t have the proper tools to cope. I tell him all I want is for him to be happy, and that I can see how much he’s changed. 

He tells me that he hasn’t changed. That the only reason he would drink is to help him get things done that needed to be done and to help him express himself. 

Today I realized, I don’t need him and he doesn’t deserve me. 

He can live his life and I will live mine. 


Again, sorry for the rant.  Just having a breakthrough and seeing that pretty much all of my issues are all because of him.

I was wrapped around her finger. Time went on and things still got worse. She learned she could control me and forced me to have sex.

f8cpp0,i think i know someone who is abusing their younger sibling and their parents are enabling/abusing him too,"so, i don’t know this kid well, and i heard this from a friend whose on the football team and knows both, but basically the older sibling is named Orie and he’s a football player and a total man whore. he brags to anyone he knows that he has a body count over 30, and is overall just a dickhead. 

yesterday i found out that he makes his younger brother Kyle** pay 20 dollars every single fucking day if he wants a ride home, and if he doesn’t have the money and his mom doesn’t want to pick him up, HE SLEEPS IN THE SCHOOL BATHROOM OR THE FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM.... what the actual fuck.

when i heard this i was absolutely appalled and wanted to go find Orie and beat the living shit out of him. but when i asked my friend why no one tells anyone about it he basically said “Orie is not someone you want on your bad side.” like he’s some top dog?? i understand the social hierarchies of our society but he’s high school popular, and if we don’t check him now this cycle of abuse is gonna continue to his future wife and children, and that’s not fair. it’s also not fair that his younger brother is being blatantly abused and no ones doing anything because they are sacred of a TEENAGE BOY and some shitty high school popularity. 

also his parents seem to be just as shitty people as Orie is, their dad really loves how Orie is good at football and is disappointed Kyle** isn’t as good. his mom just seems like an enabling asswipe too. 

i don’t know what to do. i want to beat the living shit out of this kid, because if we don’t stop him now, it will get so much worse. and i feel so horrible to this innocent kid whose life has been hell his entire childhood and who has to live three more years with these abusive assholes. 

what should i do? should i do nothing? should i call cps? i just wanna make sure this abuse ends and this kid can have a good and healthy life.

I'm quite insecure sexually so when I was 15 and still in the closet, this random guy messaging me made me feel great. We jacked off together online and I enjoyed it. I feel dirty a lot of the time after we finish but I find myself going back. 

The way he talks is manipulative but poorly executed and I can see through it most of the time, but I still speak to him. I'd say I've blocked him around 4 times and then unblocked to go back for sexting. 

Hes always wanted to meet up with me and I've been wanting to see him, he also mentioned me moving to Kuwait with him (which seems like a sex trafficking thing). 

Hes arab and older than me. I find arabs really attractive as it is, and older guys I find appealing because they typically have lower standards (playing into my insecurity again). 

We're planning a meet up, and when I'm horny I really push for it, as he does as well. And I honestly think I'll meet him.

f8ks7e,My Story of Hell,"I want to tell my story because I feel like I shouldn't hold it all in.

 I'm almost 38 years old, and for the first 35 years of my life, I lived with a narcissist.  I am a survivor of mental abuse.

My dad was verbally abusive for as long as I could remember. When I was still a kid, I just remember him yelling downstairs and throwing things against the wall while my mom would try her best to ignore him and watch TV. When he was in a good mood, we'd be fine. We went to the movies, fishing, bowling, everything that a father and son should do. Mom was never with us on our outings, which I was okay with. Back then I didn't think there was anything wrong. All families yell at each other. The days were spent trying not to make him angry, mom and I would often hang out for hours while dad slept. I used to have friends who'd come over, and dad was really nice all the time then. He liked talking to my friends a lot when they were here. I was never an active kid so I didn't mind. It was a nice break. I can play some video games while they chatted. Anyone who came over saw him as a little eccentric but not a bad guy, so we just went with it. My friends stopped hanging out with me by the time high school started. I think they felt that I wasn't willing to hang around with them. Not true, but if they didn't want to spend time with me, I wasn't going to force them. I just don't stand up for myself. Mom stood up for me all the time but I didn't feel like I had a right to. Who the hell am I to force people to hang out with me?

It was also during high school that dad's attitude towards me started to change. He would often put me down, or he'd show me how to do something, like working the lawnmower or setting up the pool pump, and then even if I did it exactly right by his instructions, he'd tell me it was wrong. I'd have to do it over and over, usually until he got frustrated with me and took over himself. He was always right, he never made mistakes, and he was the only one who knew how everything worked. I became more and more withdrawn, until I completely isolated myself from everyone. I was too afraid to speak to anybody, I preferred hiding in the back, watching but never interacting. I didn't used to be like this. I was a very loud child in elementary school, asking for attention, telling jokes, laughing.  
But by the time I was a teen, that was all gone.

It was the hardest with girls. I never had a relationship, never even been kissed (doubt I ever will kiss anyone now, too afraid I'd mess it up.) My main source of normal socialization was my mom. Mom raised me right, despite her challenges. Before she met dad, she spent her life as a caretaker for her own father. She and I were very close. I was definitely a Momma's Boy. But she didn't really know much about my struggles. I kept a lot of my thoughts from her, never even told her if I was hurt, I'd just hide the scars or bruises until one day she'd just notice them and was like ""Where'd that come from?"" Me: ""I dunno, a while ago?"" It wasn't a big deal. I didn't want to worry her.

I was and still am terrified of staying in hospitals. Mom was the same way.

I do have one friend who's been with me my whole life, name of Emily. We shared a crib, my mom was her godmother. She always confided in my mother, especially when she was going through depression. Her mom would always fight with her back in the tween-to-early-teen years, and Em would run away from home and do drugs, she'd act out, she hung out with the wrong people. And our moms would talk, with my mom offering what advice she could. Whenever they came over, Emily and I would always get along no matter what we were each going through. She was calm when we were together and to this day we are best friends. Honestly, if things had been different, we might have dated. But that never even came up. She got pregnant at 16 and married him at 21. She still remains the only girl I'm not afraid to open up to.

Dad would always play the ""friendly father and loving husband"" whenever we had friends and family over, but the act was dropped when they left. I heard I had an uncle that I got along really well with when I was very little, but he and dad got into a heated argument and dad banned him from our lives. I don't remember him, but after dad was removed from the home, mom showed me pictures she kept. He looked nice. Old enough that I doubt he's still around, unfortunately.  A relationship denied.

I do remember this other time when Emily had reunited me with Heather, an old pre-school friend, when we were in 8th grade. We all went to Six Flags Great America together, Me, Em, Heather, my and Em's mom and one of Em's friends. It was a lot of fun, and Heather and I got along well enough that she could have potentially become my first girlfriend. At the very least we could have been good friends. It was never going to be, though, because she came to my house once to swim in our pool, and that was enough to get dad raging after she left. He didn't know her, she was just a 13 year old kid like me. But she was new, and I think that made him nervous. Everyone else was already used to him, I think he just didn't want anyone to put any thoughts in my head that weren't his. So it was just easier to not have her over anymore, to avoid his anger. I wanted to still be friends with her, we were going to the same high school together, but I didn't know how to talk to her. Emily wasn't at the same school as us, and mom didn't understand. There were many days I would be crying my eyes out as mom drove me home. Heather and I drifted apart, she thought I didn't want anything to do with her, while inside my mind I was screaming for her to talk to me. Yelling at myself to say ""hi"" or something. But, she'd always pass me by without me ever able to get out even a whisper. And then one day the worst thing ever happened. She had told her dad that I was scaring her by waiting in the halls for her. Her dad told my mom, my mom told me, and I wanted to die. We were never the same again, even all these years later, I think she's still afraid of me from the days I would stare at her in the halls, even though she says we're friends. It doesn't feel the same. She takes a long time to respond to my texts, if she does at all. I can tell she doesn't think of me as a friend. If only dad hadn't been around, I know I'd be better. I still hate myself for being a coward. Dad won again.

There were so many people I wished I could have been friends with back then. Girls I wanted to talk to or ask out. But I knew I didn't deserve them. I was too dumb, too cowardly, and they never would have liked me back, anyway. Dad would always remind me they were too good for me. I pushed people away. Because I was told that I can't make anyone happy. That was just what I was taught.

During school, I got a job at a library being a Page. I grew tired of it really quick, the walking and heavy lifting hurt my back so much sometimes, and on the days when dad would drive me, it was so much worse. We wouldn't always go straight home, he liked to play cop and chase down drivers who were speeding or cutting him off. Sometimes he'd follow them back to their homes so he could yell at them, blow his airhorn (which is the reason for my current hearing problems), before taking off for our house. He even had a yellow strobe light he kept on top of his car that he's switch on sometimes. I hated that, but I knew better than to talk back to him. The worst part is when those people would look at me in the passenger seat, like they were studying my face so they can profile me to the police later. To them, I was just as bad as him. Surprisingly only one person ever called the police on us. The officer came to our house and dad went out to meet him, playing the concerned citizen role he perfected so well. The officer bought it, never even asked to talk to me. So at least dad protected me from that much. He did care, just not in the right way. He wanted to control me.

Mom got really sick in 2016, to the point where we all thought she was going to die. I was finally allowed to quit my job to take care of her. She eventually needed hospitalization, and then Dad became unhinged, he couldn't keep up the act anymore. People finally started to notice. Eventually he told me to stop answering the door. A few days later the police came, armed with assault rifles and riot shields. Dad answered them and surrendered quietly. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and taken to an elderly care facility where he remains to this day. I never saw him again. A doctor finally discovered that mom had a rare type of blood infection, it took out both her kidneys and she would need dialysis treatment three times a week for the rest of her life, but with therapy, she'd soon be cleared to come home. She was relieved that dad left, and every time he called (he borrowed other people's phones) she would block the number. But the depression was too much for her. She felt too old to rebuild her life. And she might have been, she was in her mid 70s. Two years later she tripped down the stairs (she says she tripped, I was never sure) and broke her hip. I called 911, they took her away to the hospital, and she would never return. She just gave up. Dad had broken her too much, so she didn't go to therapy, didn't eat at all, and just let her body wither and mind decay until there was nothing left of who she was. I had to make the decision to take her off everything and let her die peacefully.

I think dad broke me too, because I still don't feel sad about it. It felt like every other day you might experience, and right afterwards I went back to my video games feeling no different. For all I know, I might be a sociopath. I feel bad that I don't feel bad for my mother's death.

I was evicted from the family home shortly after. All assets, pretty much everything, went to dad. Mom's will hadn't been updated since 1985 so I didn't receive a dime. Anything that was left to me, dad had taken out for himself long ago. And his attorneys wanted to sell it all to pay for his medical care. So for a year l was living in a hotel with my dog (mom's dog, but I have adopted him). I couldn't bring any of my furniture (Bed, desk, chairs) and could only bring what I could fit into a storage unit, which was a few boxes full of my games, comic books, and the TV from my room. I worked with an organization to help me find new housing, which finally happened in October last year. However the new living arrangements did not allow pets, so I had to give up my buddy. I had friends on Facebook who helped me make sure he found someone who would love him as much as I did, luckily they still bring him over to visit :).

I don't currently work and am not looking for anything that puts me in a hard labor position. I gave 17 years of my blood and sweat in an entry level position at the library. Right now I just want peace of mind.

The one good thing that I can say is that the person I once was so long ago is slowly coming back. I am socializing more, I give Emily a hug whenever I see her, which I hadn't done ever before without prompting. I reconnected with a lot of friends from the old days on Facebook and we chat often. They've moved on with their lives, of course, with families of their own and a life. Can't say I'm not upset that I didn't get an opportunity to settle down. (Yes I know, teacher, three negatives in that sentence, oops!) I'm trying to adapt to my new life. I'm even writing my experiences down, hoping to turn them into a book. I wish i could have been like this before. If dad hadn't been the way he was... Everyone is a grown up now, it's like I ""woke up"" after a 25 year nap and the world I remember is gone. I started talking to some of my old crushes as well. Most are married, some have kids, others live far away. There are a few of the women who are still single, but I feel they'd believe I was too broken to date. And maybe I am.

I have many symptoms now that make me seem like a crazy person:

I still hear his voice yelling put downs in my head, which many times I subconsciously repeat out loud. Every time I forget to buy something, or accidentally burn breakfast, or even if I'm not doing anything at all. ""Your dumb as a rock!"" ""What the f--- is wrong with your head!?"" ""C'mon, be intelligent!"" (He liked using big words to show off.)

I don't cry. I was made fun of by dad and by kids in high school whenever I did, so now it's like I can't. I have trouble with most emotions, actually.

The dreams of dad chasing people in his car, or of mom and dad yelling, people in school avoiding me? Yea, those suck.

So all in all I'd say things now are ""better""(?) I decided not to worry about my health. Honestly, dying in my forties sounds like a pretty good ending. I really don't want to grow old. 

Mom and I used to say ""I love you."" to each other every night before bed. It's such a small thing, but I have no one to say it too now, and I miss it.

As for dad, from what little I care to hear, most of the time he is no longer even lucid enough to care for himself.  I don't feel anything for him, good or bad. He's just some guy to me.

That's my story.

Basically im 16, and my dad has been hitting me pretty much since I was 13-14. But its not in like the typical way I feel an abuser like does it. He usually will like randomly punch me as hard as he can. It almost seems playfully but its harder when hes angry and I ask him to stop pretty much every time. It just confuses me because hes still a good dad, plays basketball with me or throws the football when he can but then he does this along with something else. 

That something else is like he’ll like brush my ass when im facing the other way or like randomly touch it real quick and again ive asked him to stop multiple times but it again confuses me because he seems to do it in a playful manner

The relationship was disastrous through the full two years we were together, but I'd since been trying to salvage the friendship that we had for the last decade. It had gone poorly. She'd say she's willing to be friends, or to reconnect as a couple after she figures her stuff out, but everytime I tried to start a serious conversation about how I'm feeling or to get elaboration on some of the hurtful things she'd said in the meantime, she either screams at me or completely evades the question / doesn't respond.

I tried calling her out on the weird and sometimes damaging way she has reacted, but she just gets angry and has very recently called me emotionally manipulative for ""trying to make her feel like shit.""

It wasn't the first time. I developed severe anxiety and... some other pretty self destructive habits the last time she'd called me abusive. I was hospitalized for a few weeks, and I'd tried to convince everyone that was nearby that she was right. It took a long time to learn how to cope.

I'm still not sure though. There's a part of me that knows that abusive people are really good at convincing others around them that they aren't abusive, but I don't know if that applies to me or her. She seems unrepentant or unaware and unwilling to accept that she might be in the wrong in any interaction, but if I keep trying to explain that what she's doing is harmful and she reacts as explosively as she does every time then at what point has it become harassment on my end.

I highly doubt there's any redemption for me in her eyes, and I've finally accepted that she will never trust or speak to me again.

But this is the fourth or fifth time I've come to that acceptance, and always a few weeks later she'll message something that seems hopeful. And everytime I try to get her to open up, or at least recognize the way in which I've been treated, she shuts down and when I call her out on her refusal to communicate she turns it back on me and tells me all I do is make her feel like shit. I try to apologize, and assure her it's not my intention, and ask what exactly I'm saying that is making her feel that way, but that's usually when I am blocked.

She hadn't ever been in a good relationship in the past. I'm terrified I'm just another bad one in a long history. I'd known her for such a long time, and losing that friendship sent me in such a panic that I may have made things worse.

There's a lot more to the story. I'm an open book. If I have negative behaviors I want to fix them, because if they can damage a decade long friendship then they will most assuredly destroy everything else I care about.

tl:dr. I need help figuring out where I went wrong and how to better myself for future relationships after a very damaging one.",ASTRLABE,2020-02-24 06:30:05,2,553,22.63,42.81,86.02,1.51,21.27,15.01,95.12,60.22,22.6,15.37,8.5,0.36,0,5.61,0.9,7.23,5.42,12.84,11.21,5.61,8.68,1.63,20.98,4.88,2.89,2.17,1.27,2.89,7.96,2.35,5.42,0.72,1.81,0.54,13.74,0,0.36,5.61,0,18.26,3.98,2.53,1.27,6.15,2.53,5.42,1.99,0.18,0.9,0.9,0.72,0.54,0.18,0,0,8.5,2.53,1.99,1.63,1.45,1.45,5.42,12.48,1.63,16.46,1.27,7.59,7.78,0.54,0.18,0,0.18,0,0,0.72,0.36,0.18,0,0,0,15.19,5.06,3.07,0.18,0,0,0,0,0.36,5.06,0.72,0.72
f8s4jr,Not sure if I was sexually abused...,"I am now a 27 year old married man, and I have never told anybody about this.

It is a very hazy distorted memory, and I do know that ""something"" happened, but I don't know if it is the result of a bad dream or a misunderstanding, or if it is all something fabricated by my childhood mind.

Anyway...

When I was 8-9 years old my male cousin (6 years older than me) and I went fishing for a week with my grandfather during the summer. My cousin and I camped/slept in a tent in the back yard all week and would go fishing every day.

One night when we were about to go to sleep and it was completely dark in the tent, my cousin asked me ""do you want a piece of candy"". He said ""it was like a lollipop, or a Popsicle and if you suck on it hard, juice comes out..."" I did...

At the time the entire scenario seemed odd, and I was too young to understand anything about sex, or oral sex. But for some reason the memory stayed in my mind.

As I became a teenager, the memory haunted me. I wondered ""was I tricked into giving him oral sex? Does that make me gay even if I have NEVER felt attracted to men? Could it have just been some sort of candy or sucker?""

My cousin has always acted normal around me ever since. He has had a million girlfriends, and is now married with a kid.

Like I stated earlier, the entire experience is a blur, I don't remember many specifics. But I do know that it made me feel weird. And it wasn't until later that I realized why...

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.

Do I ever tell anybody? Should I hate him? Should I confront him? Was he just a teenage boy figuring out his body and made a mistake? Do I forgive him?

f8t7f9,Was i really abused?,"I don’t know why but ever since my stepdad left, I’ve always had that question in the back of my mind. I’m currently 17 and this went on from around the age of 4/5 to 11/12. He would constantly insult me, yell at me, swear at me and call it toughening me up, it got to the point where I wouldn’t go outside. He was an alcoholic and drug user which did not help at all. Sometimes, his lack of care would result in my real dad needing to call the police to check on me. I attempted to force myself to forget which seems to have worked in some ways but I know my dad kept a notebook of all the things I said he had done to me which I have yet to see. I do remember, when I was older he began to grab me by the collar in a threatening way and would hurt my wrists along with pushing and smacking me which sometimes has bruises occur. Now when I look back I feel really emotional and want to cry but sometimes I feel as though I’m overreacting and that I wasn’t abused.

f8uuy0,Trapped.,"I'm a Colombian 17 year old. I've been my entire life trapped in an emotionally abusive household. I still don't have any way to get out of here besides waiting until I am 18. I'm scared of getting the police involved because if Mother can do something about it, she will and I will be trapped here again. I am actually scared I will be trapped her forever. She may as well cut every possibility for me to have a source of income and I won't be able to do anything.

I don't wanna think she'll do that, but at this point it's a huge possibility. Ever heard of Uzumaki by Junji Ito? That's exactly what this place feels like. Everything here is a spiraling mess. It's like time here is slower than outside, or like it's completely still. I'm aware this possibly doesn't make sense but that is really what this place feels like.

I only have one single person from the US helping me get out, he's gonna come here and talk to lawyers and people to see what possibilities are there to see if it's possible to get me out before I'm eighteen. Otherwise, we'll have to wait.

I really can't take this anymore. Mother gets crazier every day. Things feel more distant and strange. At this point I just want her to try to murder me so that I will be able to call the cops.

f8uy7j,Why I keep trying to please people who hurt me.,"So I was thinking about why I keep people around who like to insult me and hurt me on purpose. People who get angry at me for no reason and blame me without hearing my side of the story or even caring. 

I remember when I was a kid as I am the youngest of my family I would always be unheared my opinion didn't matter. Most of the time I would have to be the one to apologize in fights even if I didn't think I did anything wrong. 

Example : my mother hated that I always wore black and we had a full blown fight in the car where she said she just wants to stop the car to let me out. Me and my mom were never close when I was a teen but I understand now she was stressed a lot and also stuck in a bad marriage. 

But at the end of all the fights I would have to apologize. So I came up with this theory of my own in my head that when ever someone is angry at me I would try to do something really nice for them so they couldn't possibly be angry at me. 
I really hated being shouted at and till now I have a fear of conflict. 

I think that fear of someone being angry at me is just too much sometimes it over rides my logic. Even if they are angry at me for no reason I will still try to apologize and make them happy. I've never been taught to have a fair argument as a child. I would always have to apologize.

 I have been the one to start the argument becuase I was angry at my partner only to end apologizing for stating my opinion..

This experience continued in school. There was this really weird situation where a teacher was accusing me of writing some weird sex story in a 2 nd graders book that had my named at the end of it. I was only in 6th grade at the time and didn't even know how people had sex I just thought sex was cuddling in the bed and kissing.

She kept telling me I will get introuble if I don't confess to writing it. I think I stood their for 10 min telling her I didn't write it. 

Then she gave me this weird ultimatum 
If I confess I could go back to class but if I don't she will take me to the principal and call my parents. 
At the point I am in tears cuz I feel like no one will believe me so I confess and she lets me go to class. 

In most arguments, I feel really hopeless. I can't stand up for myself and always end up giving up and apologizing. I feel like i'll always be stuck with my abuser because if he gets to the point of explosive anger I feel really bad and want to keep him happy. 

I've been trying to act like I don't care anymore about any outburst he has against me because I know defending myself will just make it worse. I don't wanna leave it's so stupid when I know I should. I tried but I don't know how to break up with someone who's been my closest friend in three years. Whom I trusted more than anyone. In the end I am just becoming as toxic as him becuase I feel like am going crazy. So I feel like I deserve him in the end.

I just wish as a kid I was taught to have boundaries. I wish I was taught to be able to defend myself more and believe in myself more.",asmastark,2020-02-24 09:46:36,0,635,21.89,16.05,95.98,1,19.24,11.18,96.38,64.41,22.2,18.11,14.96,0.31,0,2.05,0.79,4.09,4.57,14.8,11.34,7.24,7.72,2.68,21.89,5.2,3.15,2.36,0.94,1.57,7.24,1.57,5.67,0.47,2.99,0.63,11.18,0.79,0.31,1.57,0.79,16.06,4.09,1.89,2.99,4.25,1.42,3.78,2.05,0.16,0.47,1.26,0.94,0.31,0.16,0.47,0,7.87,1.42,1.1,3.46,0.63,1.26,6.46,11.02,1.89,13.7,1.26,7.09,5.35,2.05,0.31,0.31,0,0.47,0,0.31,0,0.16,0,0,0,8.19,5.35,0.16,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,2.52,0,0
f8v6fx,Bff/roommate is in an abusive relationship,"(this is kinda long so I apologize)

Me (20F) and my best friend(21F) are living together this year(Fall of 2019) for the first time. We have a third roommate that is basically never here. Mine(21M) and my best friend's(25M) boyfriends ended up moving in with us as well. I've met her boyfriend last year a couple times when they first started seeing eachother. Since he is a lot older than me and a little older than my friend I was a little cautious. But he was nice and talked a lot. I noticed though(before we started rooming together) that everytime me and my best friend hung out we would always ""have"" to go to visit her bf to buy him food while he was at work, it was a little obnoxious considering it would be 45 min drives but I just ignored it.

We started living together and then shortly after our boyfriends moved in. Me and my best friend are both pretty introverted and busy with school and work so it's not like we suddenly started seeing other all the time (which is OK), but I did have an issue that when we were both home I would rarely see her. My boyfriend and I hang out in the common area a lot and are welcoming to hang and chill, I do the same even if my bf isn't there too which is often. We share our food if we cook too, I thought all 4 of us would really connect.

I noticed they started fighting more too. I don't interrupt them because I trust they can get through the problem on their own. Fast forward to my birthday in December the 4 of us are celebrating and drinking (on our 6ths shots)and my friend told me to come to the bathroom with her. We start discussing our respective relationships and it's all good at first. She then starts to actually tell me the truth and open up more. She says. ""I actually have been thinking about breaking up with [let's call him] L. I was concerned and she starts talking to me about how her relationship is really toxic and it really pains her. She said he's been sending money to a random girl through insta to pay for her nails, and then she shows me hers. ""I made him get me my nails done after I saw that and he got me a bunch of flowers for forgiveness."" He's pressured her sexually (he knows too that she has a history with sexual abuse). And if she doesn't do what he says ""he'll go and find someone who will.""

Throughout the night he kept pulling her to the side and she told me he said how ""stupid"" she is for saying certain things while we were hanging and would put her down verbally. She told me after she handles her finances she's kicking him out.

A week passed after my birthday and my friend told me that she didn't mean all those things and that they are accusatory. I told her that's still not okay and she told me I didn't see the full picture and to trust her. Naively, I did.

Couple weeks go by, the fighting is pretty much the same and then one day me and my bf hear a loud slap. I confront my friend about it the next day and she says yeah I'm never tolerating this again. Basically there is a constant back and forth of her wanting me to trust her and then her telling me she is never going to deal with him again. I hear them fighting along with bangs from their room and it scares me. She sacrifices a lot of her time, energy, and well being for him. It really hurts me and I don't know what to do. I can't help her if she isn't honest with me and if she doesn't take my advice. I don't want to ruin our friendship, but if I have to, for her safety, I don't care. I just don't know how to go about it.

f8yruq,I was called by the name of my abuser. Help,"Potential trigger warning

My father abused me my entire life. I watched him break my mom’s ribs. I watch him throw my brother. He grabbed me by my throat. He would kick and hit me. He mentally abused me. He told me I wasn’t worth anything. I was fat. I wasn’t pretty. He put my life in danger a few times.

He abused me. I’m still recovering. I still have nightmares. I still have issues with everything in life. With life itself.

And today I got called by his name. I can’t stop crying. I feel nothing. I feel like I should die. I wish he would die and if I’m like him, then I should die.

It was no secret that I hated being in the army and one of the guys would always pepper me with questions. Always bring up sex even when I was uncomfortable. I’m bisexual but I didn’t tell anyone that, I’d been molested as a child but I hadn’t remembered that yet so I didn’t know. I have a hard time remembering the assault still, but I think I’m starting to remember some of the grooming leading up too it.

f919n6,"My love interest and I aren't together - but we had sex. One night he got so drunk, he came onto me even though I told him, I no longer wanted to have sex.","He had been drinking fosters all night after I came back sober from a quick catch up with my friends at the pub. Originally, I told him that I wanted to have sex with him. But changed my mind later on. 

When he eventually came around, and started to feel me up, I told him I was no longer interested in having sex. But he kept going. I continuously said no, but he was so strong that when he choked me to hold me down, I could barely breathe, and I couldn't get him off. 

Don't get me wrong - I am interested in rough sex, and usually, this sort of routine was normal in a sense of I could usually breathe and I wanted it. But this time was different, because I knew he wasn't going to stop, and I couldn't stop him. 

I know it's wrong but I eventually gave in, and joined in with the sex. Maybe its because I knew it would end quicker that way (?) But all I know is I cried after in my back garden, and felt sick. 

This was a while ago, but he recently got physical with me in an argument. And I'm not sure how to feel. He treats me like shit, and even though I know I deserve better, I deal with it because I love him, despite knowing he could never commit to me in a relationship but I don't want that because I know what sort of guy he is - but I'm stuck, because I feel there's nothing I can do. I want him here, when he's nice to me, but otherwise when he's not I just feel like I'm the problem.",I-AM-BLUED,2020-02-24 16:27:39,1,317,3.85,7.79,96.46,36.9,18.65,11.67,97.48,67.19,26.18,22.08,14.83,0.32,0,6.94,0,4.1,2.52,11.99,10.41,7.89,11.67,4.1,21.77,5.68,3.47,1.89,0.32,0.63,5.05,2.84,2.21,0,0.63,0.32,11.04,0,0.63,0,7.26,20.19,4.1,2.21,3.79,1.89,1.89,6.31,2.52,0,0.32,1.89,5.05,0.95,0.95,1.89,0.63,6.62,2.21,0.32,1.26,1.58,1.58,10.09,9.46,1.26,17.35,2.21,7.26,8.52,0,1.26,0.32,0,0,0,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0,17.67,5.05,6.62,0,0,0.32,0,0.95,0,4.1,0.63,0
f965sc,Found out my downstairs neighbor is an Abuser,"So I've been living in my apartment for about 2 months now and had noticed my downstairs neighbors would always argue almost daily and sometimes it sounded like his gf was being physically abused against a wall or something. 

Her boyfriend I met the first day I moved in and was slightly creeped out by him because he was standing behind his garage listening in on my conversation with my dad while talking about him. As time goes on he has this form of fake friendliness (almost like he's very manipulative) and he'll be very nice to me and ask if he can borrow my stuff or do small kind gestures, which he would constantly point out to me each time. 

I talked with his gf lately and found her to be a very friendly &amp; warm person to be around as well as her 4 kids. 

I found out online from a local newspaper that he was recently charged on Christmas Eve last year with a Class A Misdemeanor (the highest misdemeanor you can get!) and that he was menacing people &amp; threatened them with a knife! 

I want to help his gf to get out of that situation and that I like helping abuse victims as I'm going to college for psychology anyways.

f9eve3,Just need to get it off my chest because I’ve never spoken about it before,"I had an emotionally abusive friend for about fifteen years. I was in junior school at the time it started so it has really impacted everything about who I am today. She stripped me of the friends I had before I met her and because she was so horrible to everyone nobody wanted to hang out with me anymore because they hated her. I couldn’t leave because I was TERRIFIED of her.

She tore me down about how stupid I was and reiterated how much I needed her all the time. She’d use her (now obvious) insecurities about herself and pin them on me. She’d shut me down and humiliate me in front of people and I was barely allowed to talk to other kids or do things in school that she didn’t want to do (e.g. join the school choir). She made me feel too uncomfortable to speak and feeling extremely anxious around people became (and still is) the norm. I was the perfect target for her because I was a genuinely easy-going, nice kid.

Anyway, this went on for about twenty or so years, well into adulthood. I’m lucky enough to have finally been able to shake her now although the thought of her getting in contact frightens me to death. I was then unfortunate enough for it to happen all over again with a boyfriend I had for three years so it’s been a rough one.

I was trying to get over all the bad stuff and build myself back up but the loss of a loved one sent me back into a spiral where I feel like I’m that young kid again. I had to quit my job because I had a breakdown and lost a significant amount of my hair, and I haven’t been able to have a job since because of my debilitating fears of authority and messing up. I just cannot be this person anymore, I’m not who I was supposed to be or who I am inside. I’ve been on several different types of medication and different dosages to reign in my anxiety but nothing works. I can’t afford a therapist (because I can’t work) and the doctors just stick you on the NHS waiting list for CBT which I’ve been on for years. I honestly feel like I’m just fucked now and this is who I am forever. I don’t know what to do.

Sorry this was long, this is the first time I’ve ever faced up to it in detail. I just want to know if anyone has anything to offer that can help because I really feel like I’ve struggled long enough.",mattiusqueeny,2020-02-25 10:40:37,0,459,22.36,20.39,85.06,1.96,20.86,13.94,94.34,66.88,22.44,15.69,11.55,0,0.22,3.49,0.44,6.75,4.79,16.34,11.76,8.06,8.06,2.4,20.04,3.49,1.53,1.96,1.31,1.31,5.88,1.53,4.36,2.4,1.09,0.65,9.59,0,0.87,3.49,0.22,14.6,2.18,3.27,1.53,2.18,2.61,3.92,1.96,0,0.65,1.31,1.74,0.22,1.09,0.22,0,8.5,1.53,2.18,3.92,1.09,0.44,7.63,12.2,0.44,14.6,1.53,6.97,6.54,1.96,0.22,0,0,0,0.22,0.65,0.22,0,0,0.22,0.22,12.2,5.01,1.31,0,0,0,0,0.22,0,3.92,1.74,0

Well, I guess my mother doesn't want me to leave. She started by telling me that she will no longer be buying me hygiene products, soap, shampoo, toilet paper, etc. So I now buy these myself.

And yesterday she said that I had to pay her money every month for electricity, water and food. When I said no she threatened to go to the bank to withdraw money herself from my account. I don't know if she can actually do that, I will go to the bank today to check with them. 

I flat out told her that taking money from me isn't the best idea since she hates me and I'm trying to leave with that money, she doesn't care.

f9gl0u,Behaving badly to survive turned into my Saving grace...,"Ok so... I’m about to “celebrate” my 18th anniversary in a week to my emotionally (and previously) abusive husband. I have been saving money and squirreling away every penny I can to move out. With this said, I got the courage and guts to do it in a very non traditional way. I went searching for someone a little over a year ago to get me off. I have hit an age where I want to be able to have a libido and sex with the abuser messes with my head, he uses it as another control and tells me how ugly I am directly after... the other man, I have a genuine connection with, and no I’m not planning on spending my life with him, I do however see him as staying in my life. He is the person that helped open my eyes to what I’d been living through to the extent it is. With this said, I was having a very pleasant dream the other morning and woke to the first time in over a year, husband was interested and rubbing on me. He inserted fingers without permission, (I was crying and saying no repeatedly while he looked straight in my face) the next day I made phone calls to my local DV hotline because other man told me to and didn’t let up. He comforted me from that and calmed me and...

f9iqbu,"""emotional neglect is not necessarily emotional abuse""","Reading an article right now on emotional neglect. Starts out with:

""Childhood emotional neglect occurs when a child’s parent or parents fail to respond adequately to their child’s emotional needs. *Emotional neglect is not necessarily childhood emotional abuse.* Abuse is often intentional; it’s a purposeful choice to act in a way that is harmful. While emotional neglect can be an intentional disregard for a child’s feelings, it can also be failure to act or notice a child’s emotional needs. Parents who emotionally neglect their children may still provide care and necessities. They just miss out on or mishandle this one key area of support.""

the article goes on to list **the affects emotional neglect has on children**:

* depression
* anxiety
* apathy
* failure to thrive
* hyperactivity
* aggression
* low self-esteem
* substance misuse
* withdrawing from friends and activities
* appearing uncaring or indifferent
* shunning emotional closeness or intimacy

and the **affects on adults**:

* [post-traumatic stress disorder](https://www.healthline.com/health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder)
* [depression](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression)
* emotional unavailability
* increasing likelihood for an eating disorder
* shunning intimacy
* feeling deeply, personally flawed
* feeling empty
* poor self-discipline
* guilt and shame
* anger and aggressive behaviors
* difficulty trusting others or relying upon anyone else

f9pf3k,Is this abuse?,"I was texting my freind last night and she seemed to think it was more serious than I did. She thinks this counts as abuse, but idk. It didn't feel like it to me. So I thought I'd ask.

These are the texts I sent:

- First time it happened felt like no big deal. He just grabbed the back of my neck and kinda jerked it a little. It didn't hurt, but I acted like it did so he'd calm down. He had to drive me somewhere and it was in the way out to the car so he was scolding me the whole time we were driving. Idr what he said, but it was mean. I wish I could remember. I was more mad about that than what he did before.

- A few days later, he did the same thing to me, but this time in front of my mom. She freaked out and they got into this whole fight. Again, it didn't hurt, but I started crying. Idk why.

At one point, my mom threatened to divorce him, and he cried. I think that's the only time I've seen my dad cry.

That was a Sunday morning. We missed sacrament meeting and Sunday school I think, but still made it in time for young women's. At that point, I actually wanted to be in church cause staying home would've made me feel worse, like something was off. I was very shaken from the fight, not the incident.

- I was actually surprised my mom reacted that way. So it made me think she was against that. But like a month or so later??? idk, we got into another fight and my dad put me in a chokehold. I didn't know how to get out of one so I just dropped to the ground. We had been standing in a tight circle for family prayer I think, and I remembered looking up at my mom and her just looking down at me doing nothing, like she was fine with it.

- (she asked me why I didn't call the police) I didn't think it was a big deal. You ever see those stories or videos on the internet of kids calling the police for like spanking them or something, and the police are like ""serves you right, kid."" I feel like that's how they would've handled it. Like ik it was more than spanking, but I still didn't feel like I was in danger. He wasn't gonna kill me. He did let go. I didn't want to come off as bratty or entitled. 

And I was being a little bitch tbh. I'm not saying it was okay for him to respond like that, but all of those times, we had been fighting and it had gotten to the point where I was like fuck it idc anymore and just stopped trying to be right and fair and eloquent and let my feelings get the best of me. Any other adult, had they been there, would've agreed that I was being a brat.

I was right though, just saying

Don't know what we were arguing about, but I was probably right

- Anyways, one day I was sitting at the computer, fighting with my dad. He was like getting ready for bed or something, so he was walking back and forth, we weren't having like a face-to-face conversation.

It was escalating pretty fast and at one point, I said something, and my dad got really mad and pinned me against the back of my chair by my shoulder.

I was super secretive growing up, so I instinctively grabbed my notebook and held it against my chest, in case he like grabbed it or something??? Idk

So he was like getting really close to my face, yelling at me, and I was struggling to get out. It was one of those rolling chairs and he had me pushed so far back, it felt like the chair was gonna come out from under me.

Instead of letting go, he pushed me into the ground, and my papers feel everywhere. I burst into tears, gathered my papers, and ran into my room. And I think I said fuck you idr

- I sat in front of the door and cried, and like not even five minutes later, my mom forced the door open and tried to convince me to come out. I refused.

My dad came up behind her, and tried to apologize, but I could tell he just felt ashamed of what he's done, not sorry. And they didn't even give me time to think. It had all happened like five minutes ago.

When I didn't accept his apology, they just insulted me. I don't remember what they said, but it was essentially that I was a brat, and I was contentious, and whatever else they already believed. They would say the same things everytime we fought, and then they apologize, but like obviously they still thought them, they just only said them when they were mad enough too. So they were sorry they said them, but they did mean them.

- Yeah that's probably all the times that happened, but the reason I say he wasn't abusive is cause like he's a good person. Both my parents are good people. I don't want to think of them as 'abusers' or anyone else to. I don't like to talk about this, because I know when people tell me things like this about their parents, that's all I see. Like when I meet them, it doesn't matter how nice they are, all I can think about is that they hurt my freind, physically or otherwise.

So I try to be careful what I say. It's hard cause I understand there's more to them than that, but not everybody would if they knew. I swear if you get to know them, they're good people. I love them. I feel bad for them. They're not happy and they're dealing with so much. I wish they were in a better place.

I'm scared for them. I don't want them to live out the rest of their lives the way they have. Stressed, angry, overwhelmed, and trapped in this church that makes them miserable and hate their daughter so much

-----

Sorry that's so long, and sorry if it's tmi. I'm 19 now, in college, things are better now between us, I'm probably gonna have to go back for one more summer, but I'm not in any danger cause all these incidences happened in the space of around 6 months. And I was like 16 at least. I honestly am more upset by the way they treated me emotionally than physically, but I wouldn't say they were emotionally abusive either, just toxic.

If it was abuse, it's not really a big deal, just thought I'd get some other opinions on it, cause my freind seemed pretty certain it was.",taat50,2020-02-25 23:04:43,2,1161,11.67,29.06,92.06,2.65,15.69,11.37,95.52,63.57,24.81,17.48,10.34,0.78,0.34,2.67,3.36,7.24,3.7,12.58,11.2,6.55,8.44,2.93,22.31,4.48,4.39,1.46,1.03,2.07,6.55,1.98,4.57,0.78,2.24,1.29,13.18,1.29,0,1.29,2.41,15.16,3.62,1.55,1.55,2.76,1.12,6.2,3.27,0.6,1.12,1.55,1.29,0.52,0.52,0.17,0,5.94,1.64,0.78,1.89,1.46,0.6,10.34,8.79,0.6,13.52,2.07,7.49,4.57,0.78,0.17,0.52,0,0.26,0.09,1.46,0.34,0.86,0.17,0,0.43,19.04,6.12,6.37,0.09,0,0.6,0,1.21,0.17,4.31,0.17,0
f9t64w,Life after being Verbally Abused,"So I left my ex. He was verbally abusive he would say things to me such as, I’m stupid, dumb, and toxic.

f9vl79,Violated in my Sleep...,"So I'm really not sure how to feel. I think I'm being sexually abuse and emotionally manipulated. I've read that if you feel this way, it's probably true, but how to know for sure? Where can I go to find support? Should I seek therapy and such?

I'm not sure how long it's been going on, but recently I've found out that my husband has been taking advantage of me in my sleep. When confronted, he said, ""You used to let me do this all the time.""  
First of all, I did give him permission in the past on certain days that we could have ""sleepy sex"" - it's fun I won't lie. But last month, he decided to choke me out while basically hate fucking me in my sleep. He said I begged for his cock and that he was just giving me what I wanted. When I first mention that it felt like someone was strangling me all day, he said I must have slept on my pillow wrong... Then a few hours later, he admitted to having sex with me while I was asleep. I asked if he choked me and he still denied it, saying he only grabbed my chin, but never put his hands around my neck. He says I was crazy to think that he would ever choke me that hard.  
My neck was sore for two days (and since I don't bruise easy, there was no 'proof') and he continued to tell me he didn't choke me as hard as I'm making it out. He said I was being dramatic.

I just need to get this off my chest. I'm really upset and can't trust him anymore. It's really killed my sex drive and anytime he asks me why I don't want to have sex and I bring it up, he says ""I already said I was sorry and I haven't done it to you since"" (despite him still fucking me several times when I'm not awake and me not giving permission).

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, I was barely asleep after asking him if he wanted to have sex and he said no. I always leave the option open b/c I'm not going to listen to him say I'm manipulative because I am witholding sex. He said if I wasn't aroused then he wasn't interested... so I said okay and went to sleep. I was barely asleep when he grabbed my crotch and began to rub it over my pants. he then moved up my stomach and rubbed my breasts as well. He pulled my shirt up and then pulled my pants down. He began to finger me to get me wet. He was hard and dripping and began to rub his pre cum all over my stomach and chest. He then started to call my name and ask me if I wanted him. I kept saying no, but he kept asking. THEN he sets an alarm on his phone to wake me up. I was like what is wrong with you? He said I wouldn't wake up and he really wanted me and apparently I wanted him too... So then when I got annoyed and rolled over he huffed at me and said, ""guess you aren't going to fuck me then?"" I shrugged. I tried not to cry. I have no fucking idea what is wrong with him. He said he set an alarm so he could ""show me respect"" and not just fuck me while I was sleeping. BUT he went out of his way to wake me up b/c he wanted to fuck. I'm just so over it.

f9yhnh,"What advice would you give a new couple who have both experienced abuse and trauma, in order for them to have a healthy relationship?","As title suggests. Ideal situation would be creating a safe environment where both individuals are able to grow and feel supported.

Although I'm definitely afraid of being physically harmed by men, the emotional abuse I've experienced impacts me the most, or at least most frequently. I recognise it. I expect to be abused and catch myself changing my behaviour to avoid this imagined, inevitable anger from the other person. I will work on that and I've thought about just being single longer, but, I think no matter what, in the beginning of a relationship I'll struggle. So, I try and identify and communicate triggers. I have moments I really fear he's just like my abusive ex, it feels rational  because to me, being nice isn't evidence someone won't abuse me. What I'm learning slowly is that he doesn't put his needs over mine, is reliable, respects boundaries and although sensitive to it, he can tolerate criticism.

He is less open than me, but, has assured me after talking about our future that he is going to send me some information about what his own triggers and experiences have been.

We are both extremely dedicated to self improvement and have already come a long way before meeting. He's less outwardly emotional and more logical than I am, which I think helps de-escalate in stressful situations. But I've identified that he can internalise things and I try to be aware of that, I don't want him to take on too much. 

As I write this out, I can already see that it is fairly unrealistic. But, I still want us to try.

For anyone interested, our backgrounds are:

Him (M25): sexually abused as a child, experienced violence, been involved in a shooting, has experienced infidelity. No diagnosed mental health issues, but experiences memory loss and other cognitive issues in addition to intense anxiety and insomnia. Occasionally turns to alcohol for relief. Has attempted suicide and abused substances in the past. 

Me (F27): sexually assaulted and harassed(over two years ago), parental death at a young age, emotional abuse throughout childhood often escalating to physical abuse, parental drug addiction, domestic emotional abuse with elements of violence, experienced a lot of death. I have diagnosed ADHD and a physical chronic illness. I guess it should go without saying that I have issues with anxiety and depression sometimes, but the ADHD impacts me functioning more than those things. I'm on meds but they don't work much, I'm saving up to see a psychiatrist. I have always had issues with RSD/emotional dysregulation related to my ADHD. So, rejection triggers unbearably intense emotions for me. I've read a lot of women with ADHD are misdiagnosed with borderline personality disorder, due to the overlap. But I do not fit any other criteria for BPD.",mymentalthrow,2020-02-26 11:18:17,3,494,41.15,31.36,76.34,1,17.64,25.1,90.69,52.63,17.81,12.15,8.5,0.81,0.2,2.23,0.4,5.67,3.85,12.96,10.93,3.44,6.88,1.82,16.6,6.68,3.44,1.42,0.4,3.64,9.72,2.43,7.09,1.42,2.83,0.61,8.7,0.4,0,0.2,2.43,15.38,3.85,1.42,1.62,3.64,1.01,4.25,2.43,0.4,0.2,0.4,2.83,0,2.43,0.4,0.2,6.68,2.02,2.02,2.02,0.2,0.61,1.82,13.56,1.21,12.55,2.23,5.67,4.66,1.21,0.2,0.2,0.2,0,0.61,0.61,0,0.4,0,0,0,17,5.47,6.68,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,3.24,0.81,0.2

fa1fbx,“Left” Abusive Marriage...still feeling stuck,"Hi, if this is the wrong community for this please let me know! I’m new here 😊

So, earlier this month I finally built up the strength to leave my husband of almost 4 years and moved back to my home state (also his, but he’s in a different state for his job (4.5ish hour drive away). We have two kids together (3 and 8 months). He is very against the whole situation and is basically in denial about it. I have been very blunt with how I feel and what I need, though treading lightly because I don’t know how he would react if I just suddenly served divorce papers. So, we settled on “Separation”...but he clearly doesn’t understand the meaning of a separation and has this idea that things are going to magically be fixed and we’ll be together again. The problem is, that’s not what I want or what I see happening. I can’t be near him because I’m terrified. He’s very controlling and very verbally/mentally abusive. He makes me feel stupid and not worth anything. He makes me feel like I can’t live without him...and not in a good way. He threatens me with things like debt if I divorce him. I feel like things would be...easier on my end if we didn’t have the kids..because he’s been using them as leverage and as a huge guilt trip during this. The worst part? I completely opened up to his mom about everything...her response? Basically ignore everything I said and also use the kids against me..

So, I started talking with friends that I hadn’t talked to in a long time (because isolation is my coping mechanism...lol..) and was able to build up my confidence to the point I was strong enough to move away from him. While this is AMAZING and I am SO much happier...he still is trying to control everything from where he’s at. He’s texting and calling me constantly every day. If I don’t respond, he does it more until I do. He keeps saying he loves me and keeps coming up with these crazy future plans with me and the kids. When I say something about not wanting that, all of a sudden I’m made out to be the bad guy and told that I’m just “giving up” and not trying anymore to save the relationship. Which is true - I did give up and quit trying...because I tried and tried for the entire almost 7 years we’ve been together to make this work. 

He’s inserting himself into everything in my life here. He’s on my ass about getting a better paying job to afford rent. He’s on my ass about my mom getting a job (she’s disabled) and even has his mom on me about it too. Am I wrong to think all of this is none of his business? Am I wrong to think that separation means I don’t want to be with him and don’t want to talk to him? I’m only putting up with this for our kids’ sake because I’d never just take them from him..

Do I just rip off the bandaid and hire a lawyer and file for divorce? How do I get through this? It’s so mentally and physically draining I can hardly function. I can’t take any more manipulation and abuse...I’m in therapy now as well. I already have PTSD and other mental health issues from a previous abusive relationship when I was a teenager. I just want out of this but I don’t know how to do it when kids are involved and finances are super tight. 

Sorry this was long and probably ramble-y...if clarification is needed let me know...TIA 💜",AStoryofTwoSwords,2020-02-26 14:18:05,5,636,10.9,37.65,52.56,18.79,16.74,14.94,94.03,64.15,22.01,15.88,9.43,0.94,0,5.19,0.31,6.13,3.93,13.36,11.64,8.65,10.22,2.99,21.07,4.09,2.2,1.89,0.94,1.73,5.5,2.52,2.99,0.47,0.94,0.31,13.05,1.26,0.31,0.79,5.19,15.41,2.52,3.3,2.52,2.67,2.04,4.4,1.57,0.16,0.47,0.94,1.42,0.31,0.94,0,0,9.12,2.83,1.89,2.67,1.26,1.1,3.93,15.41,0.79,12.74,1.26,6.6,5.03,1.57,0,0.31,0.94,0,0,0.63,0.31,0.16,0,0.16,0,20.91,10.53,1.42,0,0,0.94,0.16,0.31,0.94,5.03,1.42,0.16
fa1v48,My ex wife’s daughter,"I’m currently divorced and just recently I made the decision to call cps to rescue my step daughter from the situation. I pray every day that she is safe and is being treated the way she needs to be at her age. On to the story.

For starters my ex in law family dynamic was always a bit off. They’re a big family with 7 children and my step daughter is the oldest grand child. The first big case of abuse was this. My one and only brother in law attempted to rape the youngest sister of the family. He at the time was 17 and she was 14. He told her to not tell mom. So she tells my mother in law what went on. So then they go to my step daughter and asked her if her uncle had ever done anything to her. She described oral sex in a 4 year olds way of explaining things. It happened I believe 2 or 3 times. My in-laws and my ex wife are furious. Instead of doing the correct thing and calling the cops they chose to sweep it under the rug and try and get him help because he’s supposedly got aspergers and would kill himself. My ex wife tells me and makes me swear to secrecy and to never tell anyone. My dumbass at the time listens.

Almost a year later me and my ex split and are going through the whole divorce process. Out the window goes how she treats her daughter and becomes more like Casey Anthony to give perspective of how horrible she becomes. She puts her own needs before her daughters. Goes out partying pretty consistently and dates different men who have no business meeting my step daughter and this is all going on while we are separated mind you. I never actually adopted the child so I have no say in her parenting.

We divorce and I begin to remember what kind of a mother my ex wife really was. I’m ashamed to admit but I looked at her through the rose colored glasses of love. Looking back I saw multiple red flags thatI stupidly ignored. There was a time shortly before we married my ex and her family went to a very popular theme park. It was immediate family going and I did not attend. She’s giving her daughter a bath no big deal and she says something funny. Not only does my ex wife tell me but she proceeds to video record on snap chat the event. She covers her private parts with those weird emoji things and then sends the video to me through snap chat. I even asked her why the fuck did you send me this? She tells me because it’s funny. When is it ever correct to record your naked child and send it across the internet. I never questioned it after that but it bothered me she sent me that. She never again sent me a Snapchat or image like that again after that.

Another time when we were at our apartment together and my step daughter was vpk age she was having bathroom troubles. So the doctor recommended some mild laxative and a suppository. My ex wife being a cna said oh I know what I’m doing without ever going online to learn how to properly do that and has never done such a thing at her job takes my step child in the bathroom to give it to her. Based off the screaming and crying I can gauruntee she just shoved the suppository up her butt and wasn’t at all nice or gentle about it. My sister in law who was with her in the bathroom even said geez can’t you be nicer about it.

There were other little things that happened that I can’t think of off the top of my head. When I left the relationship my step daughter was 5 years old and had known her most of her life. The last 2 bits are this. My ex wife put my step daughter in pull ups and kept her in them up until she started kindergarten. She lazy potty trained her daughter. Her little girl could have been fully potty trained by 3 or 4. Her excuse was she’s stubborn and looking back I don’t believe that. The other thing was this. Her little girl had some developmental disorders. I begged and pleaded to get her little girl in vpk at 3. She didn’t get her in till 4 just a year before she started kindergarten. That little girl could have used that extra year of help.

That’s my step daughters story. I still regret heavily waiting as long as I did. She’s 7 now. Cps has enough evidence to take her away. I pray to god that I did the right thing. I’m sorry I took so long.",hobit2112,2020-02-26 14:45:30,4,822,29.55,82.25,53.55,14.1,13.93,13.99,91.85,57.18,21.53,15.69,7.42,0.61,0.49,6.81,0.36,5.84,5.35,11.19,8.39,5.6,7.42,2.07,17.64,3.89,2.19,1.46,1.82,1.58,3.77,1.46,2.31,0.24,1.09,0.36,20.92,4.62,0,9.73,0.97,9.73,1.82,1.22,0.85,2.07,1.7,2.92,1.82,1.09,0.73,0,1.09,0.36,0.24,0.49,0,8.39,3.77,0.49,3.41,0.85,0.24,6.57,9,0.97,17.03,3.41,6.81,7.06,1.7,1.82,1.58,0.12,0.36,0.12,1.82,0.36,0.12,0,0.12,0,9.25,6.93,0,0,0,0.12,0,0.12,0,2.07,0,0

What happened:
1. Abandoned by biological parents/spent time in Russian orphanage where I was starved as an infant.
2. Adopted by emotionally neglectful parents who never made me feel loved.
3. Was touched on the bottom multiple times by my adoptive father, who refused to stop touching me after I told him to stop.
4. Adoptive mother didn’t take the touching seriously.

fa7udt,I'm so confused,"Sometimes I feel so angry and hurt about the abuse, but sometimes, like right now, I feel like while what I went through is abuse, I wasn't emotionally impacted by it enough to even complain. Was I even traumatized? Why do I feel guilty for exposing my abuser now? I remember that during and right after it happened, I would think to myself, this is supposed to be traumatizing. But then I would tell him it's okay, just don't do it again... He would do it again. I feel like I was more emotionally scarred from being gaslighted than the actual abuse... What's wrong with me?

I shouldn't have posted in the CPTSD subreddit. I only posted there because someone suggested I'd receive more understanding for my issues there, but I'm really not worthy of it.

I was recently put in a situation where I was going to potentially have to see him (I was transferred to a store that he shops at).

I'm just not sure how to explain everything to him. I don't think he understands what I went through and why it's affecting me so much right now.

faf126,"Is this abuse (Pregnant, financial/mental abuse..)","My partner (M) and I were together for 5 years when he died suddenly and traumatically. I witnessed his death and was experiencing PTSD in the immediate aftermath (sleep disturbances, flashbacks etc). 

About six weeks after his death I slept with an ex-boyfriend (B). This ex was the person I dated before (M) (several years before we met), he was the person I was dating when my mother passed away (he was very close to my family) and I have known him since we were both 16.

From that one time of sleeping together I found myself pregnant. I really wanted to not remain pregnant, and even ordered abortion pills online.
  
(M) always wanted to have a child together (I did not want any more children).

I am 32 years old and have a 13 year old from a marriage when I was a teenager (it did not last, he left while I was pregnant for the military and by choice never returned. We divorced and he has never seen my son or contacted us since.) My son considers (M) who passed away to be his ""father"" in the sense that he raised him from 7-12 and they developed a very close bond, besides that I have always been a single parent. 

I could not go through with having an abortion, even though I am extremely supportive of people having access to them. In my particular circumstance I felt unable to deal with the grief and loss of (M) alongside aborting my baby when (B) and I are both able-bodied, stable individuals completely capable of supporting and raising a child with 15+ years of friendship and romantic history/love together (this last part being the perspective (B) vocalized during our discussions on the matter and I agreed).

(B) and I got a rental house together in September, we had already been planning to get a place as roommates before we knew I was pregnant. I paid all of the deposits and the first months rent and utilities - (B) supposedly had a job out of state he would be traveling back and forth from and was waiting for a large payment for the contract to come through. The job was some kind of wire-line something in the oilfield. He did this type of work during our previous relationship and was very well-off financially so none of this seemed suspicious at the time. The job ended up not going well, there were arguments over rates and he had a falling out with the company while there was turnover in management etc etc. and he came home, unemployed. After much discussion regarding our goals, future plans etc it was decided that I would continue paying for everything while he looked for employment that met his personal standards (insurance, $20+/hr etc). He is a veteran with an impressive resume so I did not anticipate there would be any issues in this regard. It took two months for him to find sufficient employment which he began in the middle of November. He said it was a salaried position (42K annually) with a logistics company an hour's drive from our home (we live in a small town and many people commute to ""The City"" for employment).

Paychecks would be issued semi-monthly with the first paycheck being held so it would be 1 month until his first check. So I paid all the bills again in December as well as completely covered the cost for Christmas for our family. I did not receive any gifts but he had not received any money or would have just gotten first paid right before so I did not take this personally. 

Outside of Christmas and paying all the rent ($5,000) utilities ($2500) and groceries (??) for the household between Sept and Jan I also paid for his insurance ($300), parts for his two vehicles ($1000), a rental car for him to attend his Grandfather's funeral out of state ($300) and his gas/food necessities while he was going to job interviews. 

My own vehicle broke down during this time and though I was planning to buy myself a new one, he convinced me to just invest that $1000 fixing/tuning up his two vehicles instead, which I did, and he gave me one to drive (his truck). 

So after January, obviously by this point I am EXTREMELY concerned. I had assumed and he had verbalized that as soon as he began receiving paychecks he would immediately begin paying his half of all the bills as well as chunks at a time to reimburse me for what I had covered. 

During this time I also paid a $750 deposit to our midwife. I do not have health insurance, cannot afford it (I make $18/hr and work approximately 50 hours a week) and am not eligible for Medicaid as I make too much. 

In January, a few days after rent was already paid, he gave me $300 cash and said he would ""give me the rest later"". That never happened. A few days before rent was due again in February I sent him the following message.. I messaged rather than having a face-to-face conversation for many reasons including feeling as though he was gaslighting me by acting like everything was perfectly normal and happy and life was going as planned in person in our daily lives, as well as I am nearly 7 months pregnant by this time and feeling very overwhelmed and fearful about the reality of the situation I've gotten myself into. I also wanted to have on record what I was telling him:

""You need to move out and get your own place. 

I am 100% sure at this point that living together is not going to work out and you need to make arrangements to move out as soon as possible, if not immediately. 

You have completely failed to uphold your end of what we agreed to.

The entire premise of moving in together was to SPLIT the bills so that I could have a safe, clean place for myself and my child to live while continuing to save a huge portion of my income so within the year I would have the down payment on a house. 
You have effectively sabotaged my goals. 

The only thing that ever changed in that scenario was that you impregnated me by being irresponsible with your ejaculation. 
I'm not sure how that was ever translated into me supporting you indefinitely. 

I understand fully my own part in letting this happen. Why I felt it was appropriate to continually give you money and support under the guise that investing in your future would benefit our entire family unit; putting you in the best position to provide in the future, clearly I see now that was a mistake on my part which I am taking steps to immediately rectify. 

I can't understand how you would think providing even less than what we agreed upon as ROOMMATES would be sufficient or appropriate as my partner and the father of my child. 

I don't feel hateful or even angry by any means and I hope you don't choose to take this negatively. Aside from needing this situation to end immediately, provided it is handled with respect and maturity, I fully believe we can continue to grow our friendship and co-parenting relationship. 

At this time, I don't feel comfortable with you living in my home. It has become a threat to the safety and stability of my children. Since I have paid all of the deposits and the monthly bills for the entirety of the lease, I think the best thing for you to do for your family is to leave, quietly and willingly. I hope you can prove that you are able to support yourself quickly, in three short months you will be responsible for supporting a child. 

If for some reason you feel you're going to continue to be unable to fulfill that roll and obligation that's something you'll need to let me know, directly, with words that clearly explain your position, as soon as possible, so I am able to make necessary decisions and plan accordingly to provide for my children on my own. 

Of course I have been deeply deeply saddened to discover that a relationship with you involves no emotional/spiritual/intimate/financial/or conversational support whatsoever but I do recognize that everyone is at a different place on their journey and your failure to meet my desires or expectations says more for me about me than it does about you. It is clear to me now that it is imperative I begin focusing on my own path exclusively and I strongly suggest with love that you do the same. 

I hope you can graciously accept this information and truly believe that with time and space we will be able to develop a type of family-relationship dynamic that is symbiotic rather than parasitic. 

If you have any ""rebuttal"" so to speak I hope you understand the only way I am interested in seeing that information is over time, with your actions exclusively; at this point unfortunately I am unable to trust or believe you based on your words alone. 

Please let me know when/what your plans are for moving and what if anything further you need on my end to facilitate that happening.""

He responded with:

""I can appreciated those feelings. If this isn’t the right fit then that’s fine. There’s a lot going on right now emotionally. What about discussing the feelings surrounding our relationship tonight then coming to a conclusion based off our discussion? We could address our feelings about the things that are bothering so there’s no misunderstanding then express our opinions to see what can be remedied. 🙂""

However when I got home from work there was no discussion. The day following these messages I was cleaning and rearranging the room that was meant to be the nursery and he rudely came in and said ""You could have asked"" about me moving some items that belonged to him. I said, ""I did ask. I asked you to move out.""

At this point the situation got very intense as he was upset and accusing me of overreacting, etc. I just repeated that he needed to go and if necessary I would call my brother and my father for support. He did pack up his stuff, called his parents to come so one of them could drive his second vehicle while he drove his first, and he left. 

It has now been nearly a month and he has not contacted me. He spread a rumor in our (small) town that it is not his baby and I am trying to ""pin it"" on him. 

I have now paid the remaining $3500 owed to the midwife and am due to have the baby in approximately 50 days. 

I still have savings and time to make enough money to cover all of my bills and expenses for six weeks unpaid maternity leave. I am unsure what I will do once I return to work as paying for sufficient newborn childcare will drop me back into poverty territory (something I am quite familiar with and fought like hell to escape as a single teen parent) but I will most likely ask for a raise (I manage a small accounting firm that relies on me heavily). 

I feel relatively fine with the prospect of being a single parent (again) in the sense that I know I am fully capable of providing my children with the love and support they need to thrive although of course I have had to work hard to reconcile this with my desire and hope to have a traditional family this time around. I lean very hard on what I learned and experienced with (M) who was extremely loving, kind, hard-working and tenacious. Though I miss him terribly I know he would want me to remain strong and remember/employ all of our hard-won life experience together to provide the best possible life for my children now.

What I am really questioning is if I should list (B) on my child's birth certificate, take him to court to prove paternity and file for child support or if I should not list him on the birth certificate, not push for a paternity test and waive any support I would be due - essentially giving him the opportunity to fully walk away. 

There is no amount of money that would make allowing instability into my child's life worth it to me and (B) has clearly shown that he does not care for our child's well-being whatsoever at this point. I could force his involvement -- I feel quite sure he would be granted visitation through the ensuing court proceedings were I to pursue paternity and support.. all of that seems like a nightmare when his words and actions now show he does not want to be involved. But on the same hand I don't ever want my child to feel abandoned if there is some way I can facilitate that not happening. I also feel like I've already been overly understanding and accommodating for a person whose actions show very little regard for my own thoughts, feelings and well-being.  

At this time it is also really seeming like (B) is a sociopath who intentionally misled me for (???) possibly a meal-ticket. There has been evidence after he left that he was never employed at all and was only pretending to go to work (3-4 days a week 8-12 hours a day) which would explain why he didn't ever cough up his half for anything and got upset/moved out rather than having a conversation and giving me his half of the bill money.

If you've made it this far - thanks for reading!

fai4t5,"Elder abuse situation, what should I do?","Apologies if this isn't the right sub for this. Idk where to go.

My grandma (89 years) has dementia. She doesn't know who her six children are, five of whom live close by, including my mother. Currently, she needs care all day-- she needs to be fed, taken to the bathroom, and given maybe a shred of human decency and interaction? 

My uncle (my mom's brother, my grandmother's son) lives with my grandma, but doesn't help at all. He claims it would be ""disrespectful"" for him to take her to the bathroom. He does the bare minimum of feeding her. Otherwise, he ignores her, but when she starts crying and asking where she is and saying she wants to go home, he gets annoyed and ""frustrated"" and yells at her, commanding her to sit there and be quiet.

My mom is the only one of the other four local siblings who helps. She drives down every day and every night to get my grandma out of bed, put her to bed, bring her to the bathroom, and give her baths.

This is ridiculous, considering she has four siblings who could be splitting the work with her, ONE OF WHOM LIVES THERE, but whatever.

The point is: we don't have enough money to hire her help, she's distressed by people she doesn't know so that would be tough anyway, but there doesn't appear to be any way to get the other sibs to help. My uncle emotionally abuses her (yelling at her and intimidating her is emotional elder abuse) and neglects her (won't take her to the bathroom/clean her and won't talk to her except to yell at her), but if I reported him, all six siblings would be in trouble, and my mom would have to go down even more often or even live there because no one would be at least there during the day to watch or feed her. We need what little help my uncle gives.

My mom and I have both tried to get through to him. He won't listen. He has serious issues. I plan to accompany my mom at night more often (can't do the morning because of college), and see if I can at least keep him off her during that time and maybe slowly get through to him one conversation at a time, but if he won't accept help for being horrible he won't get any less horrible, so I don't have great expectations for that.

far8bs,My entire story from as young as I can remember to now (16). I wonder if i was even abused. I feel like my life has been normal mostly.,"Hi everyone. So, im a 16 year old male and this is all of my story. When I was around 7 or 8 my sister (she was about 10) and I would make out and look at each other naked and i would tell her my penis stood up when we did this stuff so she went in the bathroom with me to see it for herself. When nothing happened i told her it only stands up when she tells me ""love stuff"" so she said to me and ill never forget this, she said ""oh (my name) youre so hot and sexy youre so handsome."" And that was the first time i actually genuinely felt love. I think that might have left a mark on my brain because i still have an incest kink and sometimes i get attracted to girls that are the same age as my sister when we did that stuff (about 10 years old.) I WOULD NEVER HARM A CHILD. Just to get that out of the way, theyre just thoughts and feelings i have and believe me, i HATE them. Throughout my entire childhood my dad always screamed at me and would ""spank"" me (beat the living shit out of me). Sometimes he would ""spank"" me so bad my mom had to step in and legit yank him away from me. My dads was verbally and physically abusive to me from age 6-13. From age 14-15 he was mostly just verbally abusive to me and wasnt hitting me anymore and now at age 16 he doesnt really pay attention to me because im depressed as fuck and sit in my room all day and HARDLY EVER talk. Also, i would like to mention, my dad is for sure a narcissist. My mom on the other hand, is a good mom and I've always felt love and safety from her. Now, back when i was 13-14 I wanted to be famous on musically. I got actually quite a bit of followers I had about 400k and i thought o was a star. A guy reached out to me who said he was a manager for two other big musically stars. He even showed me pics of them together and what not so I believed him. Well, he would mentor me and help me when my parents were fighting and he was kinda like a father to me. He would do a lot for me. He told me to send him modeling pictures because I was kinda training to be an Instagram model too. Well, these pictures got more and more revealing. He first told me to take a picture of me naked with a towel covering my private parts and i thought nothing of it and did so. Then, he asked me to take pictures of me completely naked with my legs spread sitting on the edge of the shower. I told him ""isn't this illegal?"" And when he assured me it was for modeling I have in and sent it. I can only imagine what he was doing behind his phone. He made me send another number of things such as me grinding naked, me doing pushups naked, my abs etc etc. This went on for months. I would also like to add, and i feel extreme guilt from this, but one night when i was 13 or so I was watching porn and wanted to know how a penis felt..... So, I went over to my little brother who was sleeping and i put my mouth on this thingy and i kinda tried to suck it a little bit. I hate that I did this I feel like a fucking monster. I cant help but feel like a molester.

farlub,Being a 21 year old in my family,"I haven't been physically harmed by anyone and I am here for anyone who has. I know those might be words, but I just wanted to say, there are worse cases then mine.

My parents have been passive aggressive towards me since I was a child. 
I went home to get some things from my dad's and my girlfriend was in the car with me. I went to get some stuff. After about 3 minutes of me being in the house my dad mentioned how I never introduce my girlfriend and how she never says hi. Granted there were events in the past that involved them making assumptions about her from what they heard from my sister. I digress, my dad is furious. Tells me fuck off and I should go l fuck myself. Also tells me I look like a criminal. As I'm leaving he says let me help you with your stuff. I say I'm fine please don't. He grabs the stuff from my hand and kinda looks at me like he was telling me, please try to tell me to stop, please try to take what I just took. He leaves the house and goes to my girlfriend whose still in the car. Knocks on the window very aggressivly and opens the door. Tells my girlfriend with his eyes all fired up, why don't you ever say hi, we're right there. She plays it off really cool and sweet.

farwg4,I am the abuser and the abused. I dont know how to feel or how to heal,"To help explain, I'm a teenage girl and I'm posting this because for one thing, I need to get this off my chest but for another I think more people need to understand that this effects boys too. 

Theres no excuse for what I did and I'm not trying to validate in any way what I did, but I also feel I should try and fully explain the situation. I came from a very abusive home. My father is psychotic and a pedophile. As far as I can remember, he never assaulted me however some of his friends did when I was around 5. My older sister and I also had a sexual relationship when I was 6 to probably 8 or 9 years old. These things put the idea into my head that while this IS wrong, its not really that bad. 

When I was 12 and my brother was 6, I raped him. I knew it was wrong and I immediately told him if anyone found out they would hate him. I was so afraid of my family finding out that I basically blackmailed him into silence. I never did it again after that and I still feel physically sick at the thought of it
I have a wonderful relationship with him now but I can never be sure if he rememebers or not. All I want to do is cry every single night and I wonder if some of his issues are from my father's abuse or actually because of me. 

I know theres nothing I can do to fix it. Just someone please tell me how to stop wanting to shoot myself.",Beyondlost1984,2020-02-28 00:54:56,3,293,4.05,10.97,91.8,1.52,18.31,12.29,94.54,67.24,24.91,17.41,13.99,0,0,3.07,0.34,7.51,3.41,11.26,10.58,9.56,11.95,3.07,19.11,4.1,1.71,2.73,2.73,2.73,5.8,1.37,4.44,0.34,2.39,0.34,10.24,1.71,0.34,0.68,4.44,20.14,5.8,2.05,3.07,5.46,2.39,5.46,1.37,0,0.34,1.02,2.39,0.68,1.02,0.68,0,5.46,2.39,0.68,1.02,0.34,1.37,5.46,12.63,0,10.24,0.68,3.75,5.8,0,0.34,0.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.53,5.12,2.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.37,0,0
fatgn5,"I don't know anymore, I honestly don't know anymore","Yesterday we had a fight again. It ended with me pointing shears at him yelling that he should stop pushing me to the ground and pulling my hair. Afterwards he said nothing really bad happened, his exact words: ""It's not like the house fell apart."" and I cried and said that mentally it all falls apart. He walked to a different room after I said that, it's probably not true anyway, everything is normal...

It all started when, because he works in a school environment and he gets all the school vacations, he is at home for a whole week. (God be with me when it's summer break) And when he has vacation he doesn't want to do anything except gaming, stay up at 4 in the morning, sleep till 12, smoke weed, get beers or other stuff in the nightshop and that's it. We had a dog a couple weeks ago, and when he's working, everything is great (not really), we both go to our classes, he goes to his job working at a school and when the dog needs to go out, the dog is taken out, we still have to house train the dog a little. But know, I'm his cleaning lady and the dog cleaning lady (I don't care about doing it for the dog) And if I'm cleaning piss from the floor from our dog I'm the one that should chill and just sit down. I have always struggled with mental problems, depression, anxiety attacks, suicide attempts, etc.. And the dog really helps me with my mental problems. But I'm so freaking tired. It feels like everything I do is wrong. I'm wrong, in his eyes, if stuff has to be cleaned up after the dog, so dog shit has been pilling up big time on the terras, I'm wrong if the dog should be taken out regularly so accidents don't happen, I'm wrong if I clean up piss in the house (but if not, accidents surely will happen), I'm wrong if I take out the dog regularly, I'm definitely a sad case, stupid and wrong if I commit another suicide attempt, ""most of the times he says I should just commit suicide"" , when I say I'm going to that mental road again. And I start locking myself up in the bathroom and I really FUCKING BELIEVE HIM. The last weeks he has been a help with my panic attacks but a couple of years ago he was the one that said I was ""stupid, a sad case, ... Or laughed at me, threatened to leave me (sometimes at public places) whenever I had panic attacks. So with these panic attacks I fear him but also want him to nurture me because I'm scared as f... at that point. It's really sick to even want that. But it really sounds kinda normal if I write it out here. I'm just overal wrong doing anything. 

To get back to yesterday. Well it escalated because I asked him for help and after long discussing and blaming, he stood up and looked down on me, all stoned and said to me ""I'm not doing anything for you"" so I hit his arm with the water bottle I was holding (I know it's stupid) and he started pushing me down the whole time and pulled my hair. I'm so tired, I'm the one that should probably just kill herself because I'm the abuser and I don't know anymore. I wanne leave but I don't, I'm scared but my actions show that I'm the one starting it all. I'm terribly afraid of myself and I'm not. I'm terribly afraid of him but I'm not.

faw753,A story about throwing our garbage,"This is a post I made in r/stories and I just found this is probably the appropriate place to post it.. 

After the whole incident I didn’t realize how big the impact this is for he family, and especially to my father as he is having more and more troubles maintaining his normal life.

These days I’ve been thinking about the whole thing non stop. My father called several times and he doesn’t sound like he’s doing well. He lost his job now and can barely afford his rent. Also his drinking problem is getting worse. On the other post someone suggested me not to visit him or give him any financial support but when I become an adult (which is not that far away now) I become responsible finances. Also cutting off completely will not be a choice because, firstly I just don’t want to do this since he is my father after all and it just doesn’t seem like the right thing to do, and second, that is also not even possible currently in China. You could get sued by not providing enough support. 
I told him it would be the best to at least to try to quit drinking, but no, he didn’t listen. He often calls me when he’s drunk and from his voice I can tell that he really isn’t doing so well. I’m genuinely worried and probably am getting a bit anxious about this.



ORIGINAL POST

A story about throwing out garbage

First, you’ll probably find out later on that English is not my first language - apologies for that. And also I don’t want to make another throwaway account just for this, so I just used my main account (please don’t judge me)

Also this story happened when I was about three (and I’m 17 now), so I don’t exactly remember a lot of the details. I put together information from my mom, some old footage from security camera that I saw several years back (yes, those are everywhere in apartment complexes in China, even in 2006) and my own vague memory. If there’s anything that I’m not sure about, I will put a (?)

OK, the actual story.

So it was just after dinner and I was 3 (almost 4 at the time), and since the next day was weekend, my mom allowed me to watch some tv after dinner. Around 8pm my father came back home drunk. In China dinner with workmates are pretty usual and people get drunk a lot. 

When he saw me watching tv instead of, say, sleeping,  he got upset. He told me to go throw out the trash. We lived on 13th floor (not the luckiest floor to live on) in a apartment building. I didn’t really want to go because I was scared of elevators and it was cold outside. I grabbed the garbage bag and got my attention attracted back to the tv, so I stood at the door and just watched. My dad came back from the bathroom and got really mad since I was so slow. What happened next basically changed everything about my family.

He pushed me out into the doorway, and I fell. I sat there started crying (?) and, of course, he just got even madder and started beating me up. At some point he bumped my head to a metal tube or something on the wall and I just passed out. (It also left a dent on the back of my head and I can still feel it today.) 

Normally he would have stopped if I pass out but on that day he was just l... too mad or whatever, he somehow threw me off the stairs. (Not strait off the stairwell, just, on the stairs, from 13th floor to 12th floor... you get the point) 

I still wonder till this day how he managed that. I was not exactly a small guy. I was, and still kinda am, by the Chinese standards, obese and at least overweight by the US standards. I assume he was trying to get me back to the apartment and somehow did that instead but I guess I will never know.

He saw me laying on the floor facing down and not moving, and probably got scared and told my mom. My mom called an ambulance.

So I broke my nose, my right arm, several ribs, and got a dent on my head. I actually didn’t wake up until the next day and that kinda frightened my mom. So I got my arm casted and stayed at the hospital for several days, while my mom went to the city hall to divorce my dad (that was the clever choice) and we moved out several days later. 

Since all these happened when I was so young I don’t think I got any childhood trauma or whatever (i didn’t even know what a divorce is and I just thought it was completely normal that I just live with my mom pretending my dad never existed, besides some occasions where I hear gossips, I wasn’t the “special one” at all) I barely thought about this thing until now

Although I was still in contact on phone with my dad, we talked less and less as I got older. Recently he lost his job and we started talking over the phone. I started to realize how hard his life actually is comparing to mine, and he is still struggling at his 50s. He wanted to get married again soon after me and my mom left him and, let’s just say that didn’t go well. He moved around in the country a lot and never really settled down. And now that his drinking problem is getting worse and his financials aren’t looking too good, I’m now genuinely worried about him. He told me (kinda) through the phone that the reason he married my mom was in fact my mom was pregnant with me, so I realized I kinda am the center of the whole problem... 

And that is, how can “me not throwing out garbage” change the entire family. 

Honestly tho, I feel lucky enough since I know people who had worse


So I just thought it might be a reddit-appropriate story... 
OK I know this is badly written and badly organized... thanks for reading anyway.

fax3f8,I am living in fear and I don't know what to do,"I'm sorry if this goes against any of the guidelines in this community but I don't know where I can talk to people about the things going on in my life. I feel like I can't trust anyone with what is going on anymore, not that I had that many by my side to begin with. This is actually my first post on reddit and I'm afraid. I just really need one person out there to hear out my troubles because bottling it up for all these years is driving me insane.

I, unfortunately, live with my parents. Before any of you suggest that I move out of this house and find my own place, I am much too young for that and I can't find a stable job yet. I don't even have anyone close that I can stay around because I don't have too many friends and they're more acquaintances. The rest of the other people I know are related to me in some sort of way and if I tried to go to them for help, I'll be sent home again. My parents are physically and emotionally abusive towards me, there are days where I can't move my hands because of what my mother has done to them, I don't want to relive it so I won't go into detail and it makes me weirdly uncomfortable when talking about these things. I have never really opened up to anyone and I'm sure that in the future I'll be able to overcome my irrational fear talking to people about my experiences. Anyways back to what I was saying, what I'm trying to say is that I'm trapped and I really don't see any way out of this. I haven't actually been diagnosed with anything and I don't want to self diagnose but think I'm depressed...? I can't get in contact with a therapist here anyways, it's far too expensive for me and I will need to do it when my parents aren't here so they don't notice. If they know, I'll just be belittled even more and I'm afraid of that. 

They do a lot more emotional abuse than physical as only my mother does that to me and the things they say cut so deep. I'm so afraid of them. I'm nearly always sick because I barely eat anymore, I don't have the appetite for things and when I look in the mirror, I feel so insecure about the way I look. Every time I eat it's almost like I can hear the voices my parents. But it's not just that, they constantly put me down and I lost the drive and motivation I once had to do anything. Learning, dancing, drawing, singing just feels soulless now, it's all gone. They always told me that these hobbies were useless anyways so none of these creative activities mean anything. 

The reason why I'm even typing here is because today is a tipping point for me, my mother choked me and threatened to kill me until a guest cameo our housed she pretended like I had an accident to coverup the fact that I was crying. I don't know what to do. I am trapped in this weed. and every time someone tried to untangle it and help me they make it worse and worse. There are some days where just lock myself in the bathroom and want to end it all but I'm a coward. 

People keep telling me that I'll be free when I'm in university but I don't even think I'll make it there to be honest. That's what people around me keep telling me and it's making me crazy because I don't think I could ever be free.

faxapo,My boyfriend belittles me for receiving SSDI and calls me a lazy leach.,"He apologized for using this line to berate me several times before. Then he says he'll never do it again. However, everytime I communicate with him about his behavior, he hits below the belt, with low insults. How did this start? The way every other argument starts. He uses a rude tone, or says something insulting that isn't cool. Something that angers me. When I talk to him about it, he stone walls me, dismisses everything I say, tries to blame me, then calls me a psycho abuser. 

I'm so sick of this. He goes on a power tripping spree by being a bully. Hurling heavy objects at my face, kicking me off the mattress because ""he paid for it"", saying I'm having psychosis for being angry over how he treats me, demanding I can't close the bedroom door, while he barges in and harrasses me, refuses to give me space, and he violently/ aggressively wrenches the only blanket we have in the house away from me. When I try to even it out and use a little bit to cover myself. But I'm always the so called abusive one for being mad. If I simply say he's being mean or rude, he ignores it. Yet if I call him an a-hole, when he's being a downright a-hole, he calls me abusive.

fb0bfx,Wad I sexually abused? Nsfw,"When I was very little before I started school I lived in a woodland area. I after having watched a documentary about tribals wo lived a primitive life where they would sometimes walk around naked I became curious about my own body and discovered touching myself felt good. The girl next door who had babysat me previously noticed me. She looked like a supermodel, blond hair, curvey, nice breasts and the face of an angel.

She gave me a hand job. I was initially scared and shocked, but It felt nice and I relaxed a begain bucking in to her hand. I have not told many people this and I suppose if I did they would tell me I was sexually abused. There of my guilt. It never felt like abuse, but rather caring and exiteing. Loving even. It's after that I began masturbating. Later she would show me her private parts and even masturbate in front of me or touch me in sexual ways. 

I cried when we moved away, not because I felt abused in any way, but because I missed her, loved her as far as I could comprehend back then. It led me to have a thing for older women and perhaps likeing beeing cared for. 

It's something I try to push out of my mind, but I somewhat obsess over. I wonder how she's doing, how her life turned out and honestly I miss the time we had together. I feel guilty for feeling like this, because as a minor I shouldn't have had those feelings and she shouldn't have done what she did. Nor should I have become sexual at such a young age.

The reality is I feel nothing but love and I suppose lust for her and for that I feel like some kind of dirty pervert and guildt ridden and afraid of even revealing this to anyone, but I need an outlet. To perhaps find someone who can help me make sense of it all.  Part of me wants to forget, part of me wants to cherish that memory and part of me hates myself for that.",nightwalkee,2020-02-28 11:41:07,6,360,22.8,20.24,85.02,11.41,15.65,13.61,94.17,60,22.78,16.94,12.5,0.56,0,3.33,0.56,5.83,4.17,12.5,8.06,5.56,9.72,1.94,18.33,5.28,3.33,2.22,0,2.22,7.22,3.06,4.17,1.39,1.39,0.83,8.89,0,0,3.89,0,18.06,5.56,1.94,3.33,4.44,0.83,3.33,5,1.11,0,3.61,5.56,1.67,1.11,2.78,0,3.61,2.22,0.28,1.11,0.28,0,8.33,7.78,0.83,12.5,1.67,5.83,5.28,0.83,0.28,0.28,0,0.28,0,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,0,11.11,5.83,3.61,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,1.39,0,0

fb92he,Was I molested by my doctor?,"First I’d like to say I did experience sex abuse outside this situation as a child. I don’t believe this was actual sex abuse, how it is something that has definitely traumatized me to the point where I am uncomfortable with men touching me and male doctors. 

So when I was maybe 6, (sorry if this is gross) I regretfully told my mom I pulled a hair out of my vagina. A hair from my head. Which sometimes, they somehow get in that area. My mom freaked out and was like “do you have a mole in your vagina??” And after looking at me herself, she took me to my pediatrician so he could take a look at my vagina. I remember saying how uncomfortable with this I was and being reassured that he’s a doctor so it’s okay. Looking back, this is total bullshit. My mother was completely overreacting, and if I was uncomfortable with a grown man not only looking at me in that place, but touching me there, she should have left it alone. 

Even typing this out now I am extremely uncomfortable and it gives me major anxiety. Is it normal for me to experience trauma from someone looking and touching my body as a child that was supposed to be a medical situation? It made me extremely uncomfortable and I wasn’t in control of my body. As I said now male doctors make me uncomfortable. I also mostly avoid men for romantic relationships (I’m bisexual) and am starting to get involved with one now which is making me think more of this. there are certain instances when a simple hug with a guy friend will make me uncomfortable. I should mention the sexual abuse I experienced was a female friend as a child.

fb93a1,Was this abuse?,"So it's taking a lot of courage to post this. My mother has been mentally/emotionally abusing me my entire life. I'm getting the help I need now, and I'm in the process of getting away from the abuse. I talk to my therapists about everything but there is one thing I cannot tell them, and I'm not sure if it was abuse of some kind. 

I remember when I was about 8 years old (I'm female by the way, not sure if that's relevant.) I would wash my mothers.. pubic hair when she was in the bath. I would do it for a while, as if it were a game. Then I would eventually leave the bathroom. This isn't normal, right? It may have started when I was much younger, I don't remember. I'm not sure when it stopped, either. It was just ""a thing we did"". One time I guess I was curious and tried to look deeper, and she pushed me away and almost angrily asked me what I was doing. 
There was another time I left the bathroom once I'd done the washing thing, then returned shortly after and she acted very strangely and got annoyed I came back into the room without knocking. When I think back on it, I think she was probably masturbating. I don't know for sure. 

I never really questioned this whole thing, until I started having intrusive thoughts about it in my late teens. I feel so repulsed and disgusted and for years I tried to pretend it was a normal thing that happened in families. I guess I'd just like to know what peoples thoughts on this are. The memories have also negatively affected my sex life, but I wonder if I am just overreacting to it, since I have many other issues (esp relating to my mother.)",Nearby-Squash,2020-02-28 23:23:08,4,312,5.56,5.83,98.79,25.77,14.18,15.06,95.19,65.06,24.68,15.71,13.78,0.32,0,1.28,0.32,8.97,4.81,10.58,13.46,8.33,8.97,3.21,24.04,3.53,1.92,2.24,1.28,2.56,3.85,1.92,1.92,0,1.6,0,5.77,1.28,0,2.56,0,16.03,4.81,0.64,2.56,4.17,2.24,4.81,0.64,0.32,0,0.32,2.56,0.32,1.6,0.96,0,3.53,1.28,0.64,0.32,1.28,0.32,9.29,10.9,1.28,15.06,0.96,5.45,8.97,0,1.6,1.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.63,6.73,4.17,0,0,0.64,0,0,0.64,3.85,1.28,0.32

fbe4mb,... Is this emotional and/or physical abuse?,"As a child, I remember being terrified of aggressive touching. My little sibling-- whom I was four years older than-- would cause me to freeze and go into the fetal position if they so much crawled quickly towards me. I don't know why this is, and I don't remember ever being hit by my parents. When I grew up, things got iffy emotionally; when I was fourteen and shared a small d*ck joke with a friend a year younger than me (I was 14, they were 13), I was called a p*do and m*lester. One of my parents also has two isolated incidences of hurting my younger sister; once choking her, once biting her lip... But those are the only incidences of physical harm. I also want to end this with the fact that I went to therapy for insomnia and anxiety at the age of seven, but was quickly pulled from me. It's hard for me to classify my parents as abusers, for two reasons: one, they give us all that we could want financially (books, a game console, bed, clothing, etc); two, despite these incidences, my parents are normally ""lovey-dovey"" when not angry with us (""I love you,"" ""you're so smart!"", ""I'm proud of you,"" etc.). My sister even believes she deserved to be choked.

fbgjmi,My mom gets angry at anything and I dont know how to stop it,"Ever since my dad died my moms mental state has gotten very bad. Whenever she gets stressed she will get angry at anything. For example, she told me to clean my room so I got off my game and cleaned my room. When I finished she came upstairs starts yelling at the top of her lungs at  me for such retarted things like a full water bottle that is on my desk or a blanket that is on the couch. She yells so much every day at the top of her lungs for things like me not knowing when the day of a test is because the teacher has not announced it yet or I did not her her when she talks to me across our big ass house although she can never hear me when I try to talk to her from another room. 

My nose bleeds when I'm stressed and as I was typing this out my nose started to bleed 2 times. 

I'm 15 and it is a miracle that I have not killed myself yet or at least gotten into drugs or alcohol. 

Does anyone have tips on how to deal with someone like her or how to make her understand how bad she treats us although she is so loving whenever she is not stressed out over anything and I love her so much but she is also taking a toll on my mental health.",Idkbruhguy,2020-02-29 10:15:15,3,254,12.57,31.84,79.69,1.37,28.22,10.63,94.88,65.75,24.41,18.5,10.24,0.79,0,7.48,0,5.91,3.94,14.57,7.48,8.66,12.2,2.76,16.54,4.33,2.76,4.33,0.79,1.97,4.72,0.79,3.94,1.18,1.97,0,12.99,1.18,0,8.27,0.39,12.6,1.18,2.76,0,4.33,1.18,5.12,1.97,0,1.18,0,4.72,2.76,1.97,0,0.79,8.27,1.97,1.18,1.97,2.76,1.18,4.33,11.02,0.39,16.93,0.39,9.45,7.09,1.57,0.79,1.97,0,0,0.79,0.39,0.39,0,0,0,0,4.33,3.15,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0,0
fbgkqm,I'm getting tiered of fighting and being bullied for not being able to escape,"I was told to post here by another redditor. I'm getting tired always solving my own problems while people put me down. Look through my history and you'll find people blaming me for not finding a home. I've tried everything. They neglect that I am beat and tell me that its my fault. The police tell me to leave. But there is no place to go. My family gas lights and beats me frequently. I don't have the money to go any where. I don't know what to do. My friends all live with their parents. I wouldn't be able to stay for long. I can only stay at a shelter once during the evening. I've many churches, autistic organisations, housing programs, rent to own property's and I still cant figure it out. Nothing seems to be available that's achievable. I need weed to calm myself down 24/7, because of all of this. Therapy has never helped me and my family kept beating me while I was of f medication blaming it on all my bad behavior. They still treat me this way while on it as well. Medication isn't the cure or tool I need. I need support. Specifically a place where I'm alone and money isn't a problem. I work, I get ssi, and I used to volunteer, and could finish college any day now if I wasn't beaten every month. I cant leave my dads house. No group homes (because of rape) No room mates (Because everyone beats me and I want time away from that) No Full time job (Cant Handel it, I would explode at work at some point) No homelessness (Because my life has just been poverty so far, I would kill myself eventually). I feel like I'm forced to be homeless while working 64hrs a week while everyone has a better life than I do. I dont want to die, but I really should If I alone cant survive. Everyone else has figured it out. I'm just not enough and I'm not willing to be enough. My past keeps haunting me. People keep bulling me any chance they get and abuse is just part of my life.

fbh7bb,Childhood Abuse ( TRIGGER WARNING ),"So I found out last night that I was sexually, physically and emotionally abused as a child ... I was emotionally and somewhat physically abused from 15-18. The sexual abuse stopped around 14 when I confronted my mom about it .
There were lots of little things like having a nap with my dad when he had just a towel on up until I was 13. I would have baths with my mom until I was 13, and other things I thought were normal. I also remember my cousin who's a year younger than me would make me touch her inappropriately and it would make me uncomfortable.
I don't know what to say or how to process any of this . My older cousin was also sexually abused by my father . I was clearly psychologically manipulated to idolize my parents and I had no choice but to be good. 
I can't remember my childhood and almost feel like a liar, why can't I remember anything :( 
All of this makes sense as to why I struggle so much as adult. I definitely have some deep levels of trauma. It's just so hard to believe, because to me I'm an incredibly functioning adult. I've never lost a job, I've never missed a bill. I'm a harder worker, I'm honest and kind and compassionate. I'm intelligent. How can I be so functioning??? I have so much anger and resentment and sadness and just so much I don't know what to do with myself.

fbk2el,my emotional confusion crisis,"i have never done this before but the internet told me this a good place to vent and get advice so here goes nothing.

(im a 17 year old male)

im currently in my room trying to recover from a major panic attack caused from family problems, i need someone else point of view someone with a clearer vision. i feel like im never good enough for my parents i have been emotionally abused ever since i could remember it was physical at first which is normal in my arab origin, i have been hit to the point of blood, burnt, cut, tired up, and lashed, i have been sent to the hospital multiple times because of my parents until i started growing older and my genes were in my favor i got alot taller at 14 alot of muscle and just stronger in general and they couldnt tie me up and beat me like they use to so i started working out and got really big at only 14 for the sole reason of making the abuse stop but thats when i discovered that the abuse wasnt only physical but also mental, i started noticing people freaking out and getting really worried about me when i mention how my parents raised me which shocked me because my parents have led me to believe everyone would get treated like this and i will thank them later. now what was the worst part of all this is that i would blame myself for everything because i did really fucking poor in school almost since the sixth grade (im in the 11th grade nowand i started screaming back and fighting back both my parents and they started blaming their abuse on me snapping and protecting myself and that its my fault and i deserved it ) it was so confusing because they were loving parents and i can even say they spoiled me in a sense we grow up a bit poor and on the strings but we got ourselves together right before mt teenage years and i would say we are almost above average which led me to telling my self that im ungrateful and i dont deserve any of this telling myself that they loved me and wanted rhe best for me and thats why they do what they do. i fucking go through a emotional roller coaster almost every single day with my parents being all lovey one moment and the next moment im being told how big of a fucking disappointment im and how im never going to be jackshit later on and that they are ashamed for them to call me their son and its so fucking hard to capture everything into this fucking keyboard no matter how much i write i can never truly make you understand my case and thats what makes me feel so lonely no matter no matter how many friends i have i even have a girlfriend we have been dating for almost a yeat now but i still feel so alone. we would always have fights me and my parents mainly my mother that then goes to my dad and they always end up in me breaking down and a bunch of shit getting smashed or me getting kicked out (keep in my mind that these fights are always caused by the dumbest shit my motherr makes up like when she asks me why i walk that way in a disgusted manner or way am i so focused on her) it always ends up with me being the bad guy and them being the victim of their evil 17 year old son sometimes they get a bit physical after my growth and build but since im taller than them and fairly built i just stand there and take it which ends up with a couple of bruises maybe some blood nothing serious at this point. Then comes today, today was is my breaking point, my father is in the UK for work he travels alot and we are here in the UAE, it all started with my mother barging into my room while im trying to study asking me why my closet was broken (the piece of shit broke from how old it is) and she loses her shit usual but something was different with me this time, i didnt feel sad or angry i just sat there listening to her swear at me and calling me a disappointment and a piece of shit that doesnt deserve to live and how god will burn me until i beg for mercy from her, i didnt react i felt numb like my emotions were not there and hat pissed her off she called me a psychopath and started hitting my head and slapping me and again same thing i didnt feel any emotion i just stood there taking it all in and after about 6 minutes of all this i asked her to leave me alone and then she spat right in my face and everything i have been retaining the whole time blew up i started smashing shit screaming i punched my concrete wall so many times to the point where there was a hole and my right hand is swollen and possibly fractured, my mother feeds the fire even more goes to the corner of my room and grabs my bat and hits me as hard as she could in my right leg (another note im a pro boxer since i was 14 i started doing boxing as an outlet and i was amazing at it so i was very use to pain and very tolerent with it and also im from arabic Palestinian origin and my people are almost all blessed with really thick bones and really thick skin which makes it extremely hard to break a bone) after hitting me once on my leg and me not reacting she goes for my thigh and hits my pocket with my phone in it and she smashed it and honestly i couldnt care less bout that but for some reason it pissed me off so much but i kept that anger in me and then she takes the phone out of my hand after i pull it out my pocket and looks at it and i say look what you have done she looks at me and with the phone that has shattered glass all over it then she hits me on the left side of my face right next to my eye and my face begins to bleed which didn't seem to cause any kind of sympathy in her heart but in fact she takes that bat and hits me directly on my left collar bone at this point im with a bleeding face and a fractured right hand, a bunch of bruises caused by a bat from the calf up to my ribs and some glass shards in my left eye and i just go completely silent she goes to hit me one more time with the bat but i grab it last second and pull it out of her hand which causes here to trip over and for the first time in my life i layed hands on my mother, i grabbed her by the arm and pulled her very violently out of the room and locked my room and now im writing this with all the injuries spoken about above with my right eye full of tears and my left eye full of bloody tears (took a shit ton of drugs that i have hidden in my closet to try and calm down, some weed and pills and alot of alcohol which i dont generally use as in outlet or a coping mechanism but i just wanted to feel something other this) all i ask of reddit is to solve my emotional confusion crisis because i feel like my parents have brainwashed me so much to the point where i feel like im abusing them by defending myself and honestly im starting to believe they are right even tho i know deep down its not like that.",2_hop,2020-02-29 14:14:16,2,1362,29.14,19.12,93.83,1,170.25,11.82,92.66,59.62,22.1,16.45,12.63,0.51,0.15,1.69,1.47,5.65,4.26,13.66,7.05,6.02,9.77,1.62,15.64,4.92,2.42,1.98,1.03,3.23,5.95,1.1,4.7,0.29,2.13,0.73,8.52,1.32,0.29,1.91,0.51,12.26,1.54,3.01,0.88,2.79,2.2,2.42,3.52,0.66,0.81,1.98,4.48,3.08,1.17,0.37,0.22,6.46,1.76,0.88,2.13,1.25,0.73,4.48,8.66,0.59,16.23,1.62,8.37,6.17,0.66,0.37,0.59,0.15,0.22,0,1.4,1.25,0.15,0,0,0,2.72,0.51,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07,0.88,0
fbkhkt,Am I now the abuser,"So I can’t go into all the abuse, mental and emotional, on me and my two daughters over two years. But my husband has borderline. The only time it was physical is when he bit our one year old bc she “wouldn’t shut up”. He was on a too high does if lexapro that made him cold and not well. He was in a mental facility for two weeks after that and had to be monitored by cps for a month before living with us again. Most his anger is directed at me and my eldest, who isn’t his. He will accuse her of lying and being manipulative and a brat when she’s just a normal and actually helpful 5yr old. 
Over the years he’s tried various drugs and they either did nothing or made his rage worse. He’s been off for about a year. 
Due to work stress he’s been escalating the aggression to actual violence and we just leave. 
I’m 7 months pregnant now, and on bedrest. I was actually at the hospital last night due to the issues I’m having and got discharged at 2am. 
Examples of his abuse is that we had our two kids with us and he spent the whole time screaming, like as one would see a movie drill sergeant, at our two year old that she was bad, evil, terrible because she couldn’t sit still for 5 hours and was stir crazy. My 5yr old needed a straw and I asked if he could ask nurse and he called me a bitch because he hated that he had to do anything I couldn’t, and I said I wasn’t my fault and he got in my face saying I was just making it up to ruin his night and life. That he had work the next morning and that this was awful for him. I said nothing had happened to him and I was the one scared and worried because of my medical stuff. And because I cried he made fun of me before finally just getting the straw. 
His favorite thing to scream when I beg him to stop is “or what???!!” 
He’s highly suicidal but only to escape the shame of people knowing. Even when he doesn’t have his BPD episodes, he’s only happy with his friends. Because the bedrest I can’t physically leave, or work to pay rent. I have no family or friends. Just my beautiful girls

So after getting home so late last night he calls at 1pm to say he’s in hospital because his tooth hurts so bad. So I am as always nice and send him insurance info he never remembers to be seen. He’s weeping about how much it hurts, I say hopefully they’ll give him the antibiotics etc and it’ll be ok. He got home 30min ago after waiting long for scripts, he had to get mine and his. Since they prescribed him pain killers, which he’s had a history of attempting suicide with, I just asked for the bottle. He took his steel toe boots off and chucked them at me and my two year old in bed, she was on my lap. He told me fuck myself and he was gonna lay down, I said I just needed to make sure he didn’t take the whole bottle (the last attempt was only 5 months ago, he was in a facility for a week after). So he charged at me like full on ran and got so close to my face he was spitting and I was scared and I slapped his face. I didn’t know what else to do. He cocked his fist and swung but I slapped again and he fell to the ground crying. Saying I hit him and how he’s going to call the cops because I abuse him. I was so scared. And I didn’t know what else to do. And all I can think about is how I hit him in front of my daughter. Now I’m scared to call any cops bc I’ve heard of them arresting the female for slapping. It wasn’t hard, but it’s where his tooth was I guess. But I’m on bedrest, having premature contractions. I don’t feel the girls are safe with him, he hates them anyway right now. 
I don’t know if should call the cops anyway. I wish I could drive in the car and just bring them away. 
But now I feel this is my fault.",OneRutabaga5,2020-02-29 14:44:46,6,753,13.51,56.33,25.23,1,17.11,10.62,93.09,62.02,22.05,18.99,8.23,0.93,0,8.9,0.93,3.05,4.65,11.55,11.29,6.51,10.23,2.52,20.72,5.44,1.86,1.73,1.59,1.33,6.77,1.46,5.31,0.93,1.73,0.8,15.27,0.66,0.27,1.46,8.23,10.36,1.2,2.52,1.86,1.73,0.93,3.59,2.66,0.4,1.33,0.93,2.66,0.93,1.59,0.27,0,5.98,1.59,0.53,1.59,1.2,1.06,8.23,10.09,0.93,14.74,1.86,5.31,7.57,0.53,0.4,0.66,0.53,0,0.4,1.2,0.27,0.4,0.13,0.13,0.27,14.08,5.58,2.79,0,0,0.4,0.27,0,0.53,4.25,0.27,0

fbm2kp,Thoughts on this please. Content warning for bad sexual stuffs.,"Signs of further abuse

I have direct memories of abuse from my teen years, but I have signs of abuse from as far back as kindergarten.


Content warning ⚠️ 


I’m not sure how old I was, but I was watching Barney the dinosaur and wearing pull ups at the time. Me and a girl I still know were “playing doctor”. She was also wearing pull ups at the time. 


Around the age of 9 I got into porn, and quickly found myself serching for non-con kinda of porn (non-consensual). As well as bondage.

Durring sex I lose my ability to speak, i dissociate, feel like a child, and I have little ability to say no when sombody wants to have sex with me. 

I have had feelings of “I need to let him sleep with me because we already went on a date.”

fbnbuq,Thoughts on this,"I like the idea of sex, but when it comes to doing it IRL I just can’t. I did it a few times before and I dissociate, and I can’t speak along with some other stuff. I think I had sex like three times in total and I don’t plan on doing it again.


I’ve been told this might be tied to sexual abuse and because I remember almost none of my childhood I’d like to hear y’all’s opinions.

fbs60s,Help please,Im in my teens and pretty chubby. I got hit alot when i was a child i was always just slapped or something that. My parents are divorced and if im at my dads house where i should be most of the time (mom cant handle me) i get hit more and more. I neeeed ur thoughts on this i got kicked in the ribs very often. I get hit with a fist often till i collapse and break down. In that case he pulls me up and tries to get me to finish what i was doing. Last week ago i got kicked in the ribs do hard a day later i collapsed at my moms house. I should probably say my dad is a big strong guy. He is atleast 20 cm bigger than me and could strangle me to death with just one hand. I was always a strong guy but my dad could just end my life right then and there if he wanted. I remember one time i had so much blue spots from him as he hit me over and over. I cant do it anymore i made this account for only this reason. Just tell me what should i do? My father abuses me physically and my grandma and mother emotionally. I heard go to the police but i love them so much even if they are doing this to me.,sausagemustard8,2020-03-01 02:17:18,9,240,13.07,14.87,94.93,57.28,15,6.67,93.75,61.25,25,20.42,17.08,0,0.42,2.08,0.83,4.58,3.75,10,9.17,6.25,9.17,0.83,18.33,5,2.92,1.67,1.25,2.5,2.5,2.08,0.42,0,0.42,0,10.83,4.17,0.83,1.67,4.58,11.67,1.25,0.83,3.75,4.58,0.83,3.75,2.08,0.42,0.83,0.83,2.5,1.25,0.83,0,0,8.33,1.25,0.42,4.58,2.5,0,6.25,7.92,0.42,14.58,0.83,6.25,7.08,0.42,0,0.83,0.42,0,0.42,0.42,0,0.42,0,0,0,7.08,5.83,0,0,0,0.42,0,0,0,0,0.83,0
fbtlk9,Girlfriend won’t stop taking glasses,"I (25m) have been with my gf (27f) since my sophomore year of college. Every time we have sex or make out she takes my glasses off. I have extremely bad eyesight (+21, +24) and we met in college on a couch at a party when an extremely hot girl sat next to me on a couch, slipped my glasses off, unzipped my pants and [redacted]. We’ve been together ever since, and the way she signals that she wants to mess around or make out is by taking my glasses off. I’ll be honest, even the first time she did it on the couch, I was afraid she was gonna run off with them and leave me blind in a house full of people. (Happened before in HS, long story,) but something told me to go along with it, and I’m glad I did. We’ve never had sex or made out in the entire six years with my glasses on. The sex is great though. If she wants to mess around before I leave the house in the morning, she’ll take my glasses off the nightstand and when I wake up and they aren’t there she gives them back after [redacted]. Tbh, I’ve never been completely comfortable with this arrangement. The sex is great, but she’s in control. We’re done when she says we’re done. 

A few times, she’s kept them from me for hours and made me “beg,” in a playful way. It was all very sensual, but again, it depended on me being blind and her deciding when to give me back my sight. A few weeks ago I decided to talk to her about cutting out the glasses play. She got surprisingly angry, like she felt like I’d invalidated the whole relationship. I figured that if I told her she was taking advantage of my “disability,” (I don’t like to think of it this way, but I’m completely helpless without a piece of plastic on my face, so, I guess...) We shouted at each other for a few hours and went to bed. The next morning I woke up, and my glasses were gone. I woke her up and told her I didn’t want to fool around. She said: “I don’t either, but since you said I was taking advantage of your “disability,” let’s see how you like actually being disabled.” I hopped out of bed and demanded she give them back, she said she didn’t have them on her, and if I wanted them back I would stop shouting. I never wanted to put my hands on a woman more in my entire life. Except: 1. Morals. 2. I doubt I could even catch her. The rest of the day until about 7 pm she “waited,” on me, bringing me food and anything I wanted....except my glasses. Finally, she gave them back, and I was so overcome by what had just happened, I just went to sleep. For the last few weeks I’ve slept with my glasses in my pocket, if she so much as reaches near my face I pull away, we haven’t had any sexual contact since that day. 

A few days ago she left to stay over with a friend. I stupidly let my guard down and left my glasses on my night stand. I guess during the night she snuck back into our apartment and broke them in half. So here I am, a grown man, typing on reddit with a poorly taped together pair of coke bottle glasses trying to figure out how to convince a woman I’d like to spend the rest of my life with to stop blinding me.

fbxuid,Traumatic Psychiatrist App,"* TRIGGER WARNING *

I decided to write a complaint about that psychiatrist I visited.

On February 28th, I had my first appointment with a psychiatrist ( Dr. O ) . I am not normally one to make complaints, but I am deeply hurt by the experience I had on that day.
Dr. O was incredibly cold with me and short. I felt like I was on the verge of crying during my appointment. I felt like I wasn't taken seriously. I had originally come in looking to find out if I had some sort of mood disorder or OCD . When I tried to explain myself he cut me off and said "" You haven't given me an exact situation yet, I need you to give me something exact "". It was difficult for me to explain as I had so many things going through my head on-top of the cold environment. I then brought up that I was diagnosed ADHD as a child. We were talking about dosing for my medication and I asked if it was ok if I took the Adderall only on the days I really need it. He then suggested that I ""grew out"" of my ADHD because if I REALLY had ADHD I would need it everyday...Which is absolutely not true , I struggle everyday with it, some days are just better than others and don't require medication. On-top of that why would he then prescribe me Adderall if I "" grew out "" of my ADHD , that's very contradictory. He ended up summing up the entire appointment to me just having anxiety. There is something much bigger going on. Spending hours and hours ruminating and obsessing about things is not normal, it takes up large chunks of my time and is incredibly distressing and effects my quality of life. My mood swings from happy one minute to crying or panicking the next is not normal, again it effects my quality of life . My difficulty with friendships and relationships is not normal. There is so much more , but I couldn't even go into detail at the appointment as he was so unapproachable all I wanted to do was go cry in my car.  I felt incredibly invalidated, depressed and scared. 

Later that day I ended up visiting my aunt and cousins house . A large chunk of my life I had very little contact with my family ( I will mention that I'm adopted. I was placed with my adoptive family at 2 months old ). I will refer to my adoptive parents as father and mother as I have never seen it any different. At 18 years old I decided to move out because my household was incredibly toxic and abusive . At 21 (now)
I have decided to try and reconnect with my family. I decided to ask a few questions about my childhood that troubled me. I ended up finding out that my abuse was far worse than I had realized. As a baby my mother would hit me when I had a bowel movement , so as a baby I started hiding my bowel movements because I was afraid of getting hit . As a teenager I didn't understand why but I would jump anytime she raised her hand. I now understand why. My father sexually abused me for years, I have no recollection of it as it must have been so traumatic that my brain blocked it out. I remember some covert sexual abuse from age 12+ . I remember one major traumatic event at age 14 where my father had his cellphone underneath the crack of the bathroom door in order to try and take pictures of me in the bathtub. My father also sexually abused my older cousin 2 years before I was born. I was mentally, physically abused and neglected growing up by my mother. My father was my favourite I always had the closet relationship with him and disliked my mother . I made a comment to the psychiatrist that I would fantasize about killing my parents when I was younger, he then made a comment similiar to "" oh all kids want to kill their parents because they don't like them"". Saying that even makes me feel sick, how incredibly insensitive and cold to say to someone who's struggling the way that I am. I would've explained a lot more of my childhood but I did not realize the extent of my abuse. I'm so incredibly sad and taken back by all of this, especially since the psychiatrist just dismissed me as someone with just anxiety . No it's not just anxiety I am deeply hurt, but I function because I didn't let my childhood break me. I created coping skills in order to survive. I am in survivor mode right now and Its time for me to heal.",gaiashay,2020-03-01 10:03:32,5,801,31.46,11.79,97.89,1,17.8,18.6,92.63,58.43,21.35,16.48,14.48,0.12,0.25,1.25,0.37,4.87,3.62,14.11,8.61,5.62,7.74,2.12,18.1,5.37,3.25,1.25,1.25,1.87,6.62,1.12,5.24,1.25,1.25,1,7.99,2.5,0.12,0.87,1.62,13.73,3.12,2.25,2.37,2.62,1.75,3.62,2.25,0.37,0.5,1.25,2.62,0.62,1.62,0.37,0,6.49,1.37,1.37,2.5,0.87,0.75,8.49,7.24,1,15.61,2.12,6.49,6.74,0.37,0.75,1.12,0.12,0,0.25,0.75,0,0.37,0.25,0.12,0,12.36,6.12,2.12,0,0,0,0,0.25,1,1.75,0.75,0.37
fc31bg,How to handle close friend being revealed as a sexual molester,"Throwaway account cause the person in question might see it. I'll give some background, but keep it vague. Also sorry if this a repost, searching this topic I came up empty.

So, recently a very close female friend of mine told me that our mutual male friend, whom I am also close with is a molester. From information she has gathered he was a serial offender at his former work place where at the very least he made inappropriate passes at some of the young girls there (he was technically their boss), and at the most he abused his power and situations he was in to try and feel them up. My female friend talked to some of these girls as she knew them and some of them told her their stories. Apparently, after some of them raised the issue at work, the main boss gathered everyone in question, all the girls who had reported the molestation, and my friend, their boss, without warning and made the girls confront him on what he had done. Shockingly (sarcasm), most of them couldn't say anything because honestly who could in that situation.

When I was told of this I was completely stunned. After that, my female friend told me that he had tried the same with her once at a gathering, finding an excuse to take her somewhere else and then tried something with her but she resisted.

After all of this I definitely believe everything she said, as shocking as it was because I had never seen or suspected anything of the kind from my friend. And we are fairly close.

So now, I am not sure how to handle the situation. I obviously can't pretend nothing happened, and I can't keep hanging out with him like nothing happened. But I am not sure what to do exactly.

If anyone has any similar experiences like this or suggestions on what course of action I could take, I would really appreciate it. I really feel I need to do something, at least to let him know that I don't tolerate that kind of behaviour, because I think it's important that we men call out our male friends on crap like that.",ThrowAwayAccountx985,2020-03-01 15:50:25,8,379,30.14,76.99,28.98,7.49,21.06,17.41,95.51,61.48,23.48,14.78,6.33,1.06,0,5.28,2.11,8.44,5.01,13.98,7.92,5.01,8.18,2.64,15.83,5.8,4.75,2.64,0.26,3.17,5.54,1.85,3.43,0,1.32,0.53,19.53,0,2.11,3.96,3.96,19.79,3.69,2.11,1.85,6.86,3.43,3.96,2.37,1.06,0.53,0.53,0.53,0.26,0,0.26,0,8.44,3.96,1.58,2.11,0.53,0.26,7.12,8.18,0.79,10.82,1.06,6.86,2.9,1.85,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,12.4,4.49,5.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.58,1.06,0
fc3npk,What's the line between yelling and verbal/emotional abuse?,"My parents both have been very degrading in their arguments with me. I just had an arguement with my father in which he told me I do nothing to contribute to the family (I'm 17, not even really capable of doing much anyway). I've been wondering for the past few years whether or not their words count as verbal abuse. They almost always speak to me in either a loud, angry voice, or an ""I'm not yelling"" sarcastic and demeaning sort of voice. I'm starting to feel suicidal again because of the pressure they put on me, and that really scares me. I also feel like I can only blame myself for feeling this way because I think it's not right to blame my problems on other people, even if they really are hurting me.

fc4gr3,I can’t tell if i’m the bad person or not or if we both are.,"I want to begin by saying I don’t know if I fit here, my friend is the one being abusive but I don’t know if that’s even considered ‘proper?’ I have people around me telling me I’m not the bad person but I really just need conformation from strangers. ((For some context, I made a friend at the start of the last school year in September 2018. I live in UK and we have 6th form which is 2 years of school from the age of 17-18 and usually a lot of new people come to the school who haven’t been there the previous years. I’m also autistic so I struggle quite a bit with social interactions and knowing when someone doesn’t have good intentions. Also I apologise if this is a bit all over the place I’m not very good at writing about these types of things.)) 

So I met her at the start of the year, I thought she was insanely pretty and cool and seemed like a fun person to be around. So I added her on Snapchat and started talking with her. She seemed really nice to begin with and we had a few similar interests. Everything was great at the beginning, Me and my other friend I’ll call ‘L’ left our old group of friends behind as they were horrible and I started hanging out with her and her ‘group’ we all became quite close me especially with the abuser I’ll call ‘*’ and another girl who I’ll call ‘J’. It was only really between the spring/summer of last year that things kinda seemed not right. She talked about her ED and that she was triggered about a lot of things which I get, I have triggers of my own but, these triggers began to be focused on what I wore, I wasn’t allowed certain colours, patterns, specific styles because she ‘owned’ them. I began a relationship with my current boyfriend in April time and when we had all met up as a group she had an issue with me sitting on his lap as it was apparently triggering. I can respect people’s triggers but this seemed like more than that. 

Before meeting my boyfriend ‘*’ and I had a sort of romantic undertone friendship, we had both recently gotten out of bad relationships and I suppose we were just drawn to each other, neither of us are straight so it would’ve made sense. However, she didn’t respect my boundaries. Any time I was round at her house she put her hand ‘jokingly’ on my inner thigh v e r y close to where it shouldn’t be which I always recoiled from but I never said anything which I suppose was a mistake on my part. There was also a party at a friend’s house where ‘*’, I and a few friends where sitting in our friend’s bedroom for a quieter place to sit and she pulled my top up ((I don’t typically wear bras and in this top it was very obvious I wasn’t)) and exposed me to the rest of the group which, even writing this I’m still embarrassed about. I didn’t know what to do, I think it was meant to be a joke but had anyone else done it she would’ve called them out.

She used me as a therapist quite a lot and I’m not sure if she realised she was doing it but she just put a lot of her problems onto me which, I don’t mind helping with but it took a huge toll on my own mental health which wasn’t great to start off with. She constantly talked about suicide and relapsing yet refused professional help which I suggested every time and it felt like going round in a vicious cycle of her dumping emotional baggage on me, me trying to help and her refusing. I eventually spoke up about it and she made me feel so guilty for doing it. I do want to help of course I do, she was my friend I didn’t want her to be upset. But she rarely returned the service, it was like she only talked to me when she needed something, only to vent.


She always made sure to point out when talking about interests that she liked them more or knew more or liked the thing longer, similar with the clothing and hair and makeup, it was hers and no one else could have it. It got so bad that I just stopped talking about my interests altogether. Special interests are a big thing for most autistic people so it was insanely hard to just stop talking about the things I enjoyed, it’s the very core of me as a person. When we did have similar interests that I hadn’t talked about to her specifically and I said something she’d become angry and somewhat gaslight me by saying I never showed interest in the topic before or if we both liked something she tried her best to make me feel stupid if I didn’t know everything, she just gate kept everything, even her illnesses, EDs, anything she could.

It was actually my boyfriend who brought to my attention that ‘*’ was potentially abusive and for ages I denied it because, this was my friend she’d never do that but, I started noticing things about our friendship that weren’t right. I eventually brought it up to my other close friends, ‘L’ and ‘J’ and they said they felt exactly the same which was a huge weight off my shoulders but also hurt me because ‘*’ had been treating them the same way. 

Unfortunately I can’t avoid her much as she’s in some of my classes and still in my friendship circle so we just have to struggle through it until the end of the year.

Everyone I’ve told about ‘*’ has said she’s the bad one but I’m so so anxious that it’s actually me or I’m also an abuser and I don’t know what to do about it. 

Has anyone experienced a similar situation or could tell me if I’m the one in the wrong, is that a normal response? I just want to feel I don’t know, less anxious about the whole situation.

fcbdvv,My dad hits me,"It started about a year ago when my autistic brother had a meltdown and he got violent. I was scared for my own safety as well as my family’s, so I called 911. That was the wrong choice. My mom found out and screamed at me. The cops showed up, my brother said he was suicidal (he later said he was lying), and my mom screamed at me the entire way to the hospital. She told me she thought I was crying in front of the cops for show. She took my phone and threatened to sell my pet gerbils. My dad found out and told me I was tearing the family apart.

Cps was involved and they didn’t find anything. My dad slapped me for the first time not too long after. It was because I told him to stop spitting in my face when he was yelling at me. Yes, I screamed at him, but that’s not an excuse for a grown man to hit his (at the time) 17 year old son. Before that, the exact same thing happened but instead of him slapping me he spit in my face purposely. 

He’s hit me several times since. One time was on my way to a friends house because I forgot my charger there. I can’t remember the argument but me punched my shoulder and I started crying. He told me what I was experiencing was not abuse and if I thought it was he would show me what real abuse was. He hasn’t hit me in over a month. 

I’m 18 and planning on moving out. My parents get mad when I talk about moving in with my friend and I don’t understand. My home life has always been tough, having a brother with extreme violent tendencies, and I don’t see why they can’t understand I’m an adult now and I can move out.

fcgqf4,Ever feel like you're being dramatic?,"Sometimes, when I share details of my past relationship, I feel like I'm just being dramatic in using the word ""abusive"". But saying ""he was an asshole"" really doesn't feel substantial enough to describe the impact he had on me emotionally. 

I don't feel this way about other people...really just myself. Anyone else experience this?

And now: my shameless search for validation for anyone who has the patience to read

He would tell me things like:

*  I wasn't a hard worker (when I would travel to see family and work remotely)
* My antidepressants and therapy were a waste of money
* I was superficial for wanting to redecorate (when we moved in together)
* I don't think for myself (when I wanted to do dog training classes)
* I was frivolous and wasted money (for wanting to take a coding class)

He would: 

* Expect me to cook but consistently criticize my meals (especially ""how authentic"" something was)
* Get mad when I didn't make coffee the way he liked it - saying I never listened to him and didn't care
* Get enraged if things weren't picked up in the apt (sometimes break things in his anger)
* Get mad when I didn't want to take up his hobbies and tell me I wasn't putting work into the relationship

fcjfnv,My boyfriend keeps taking my vibrator and refuses to give it back. Am I right to say it’s abusive?,"Background: We have a healthy sex life however I’m very sporadic. My hormones have been really off for a while now. When I do actually want sex it’s at random times and the urge doesn’t last long. Normally he’s busy so I just vibe real quick. We still have sex almost nightly but it’s normally just for his satisfaction. And sometimes I don’t want to go through the whole thing you know? In the past he hid a dildo I had because he thought it was bigger than his peen and didn’t want me using it. He also doesn’t like to masturbate at all. 

  He says that me using my vibrator makes us have sex less. I disagree. I noticed it was gone from it’s usually spot and I hadn’t seen it for a few days so I asked him if he took it. That right there should tell him just how often I use it. But he said yes and refused to give it back or tell me where he hide it. I instantly felt off and told him it felt like he was trying to control my orgasms. He said, “I thought that was a kink you liked”. Speechless. So then I told him it’s the same thing as if I were to say he isn’t allowed to jerk off in the mornings. He said he uses just his hand so I just need my hand. I said why would I use my hand if I have a vibrator? I even said he should get himself a toy if it makes it feel better when he’s solo. I didn’t want things to escalate so I left it alone after that. 
 
 He’s done and said questionable things that I’ve just ignored so far. But this seems overboard. Is it abusive for your partner to control your orgasms? Or say you can’t masturbate?

fck0yl,I am emotionally damaged and I need help coping and planning for my future.,"So, I don't really like talking about my sister much, because my mother told me she's her business and the last time she found out I told someone about my sister she screamed and hit me. Please don't be too brutual as I am prone to panicking moderately easily. 

My sister is... Insane. Her IQ is 46, she has Schizophrenia, psychosis, Autism, OCD, etc. Ever since I was little I'd take care of her, since my father died. I've been marginally bitter towards her, my mom didn't get to do normal things with me or spend proper time with me and give me the validation I needed. She was too busy trying to make sure my sister didn't kill me or herself. I was her main target for some reason. 

My past has caused me to be emotionally damaged to a point I don't know how to cope. I wanted to commit suicide at 9. I would yell at my sister because she would do things I knew my mom wouldn't be okay with. I was basically her second parent. I would sob on the floor for my dad because I just didn't know how to handle her. 

My mom on the other case.. I love her, I can't say I hate her because that never lasts, she does have good aspects. My earliest memory was I think spilling orange juice on accident near the PC and she grabbed a belt and whipped me with complete anger as I screamed I was sorry. Im still traumatized from that honestly. 

When she was mad/I did something wrong, she would throw electronics at me/whip me with a belt and shame and degrade me for an hour. Depending on how bad it was a certain amount of time later, usually like a day or less she would try to cuddle me and tell me she loved me and is just trying to support our family and needs my help. I would feel horrible ever thinking bad about her and think she was a great mom. This gave me a horrible mindset for friends. They would call me ugly and obnoxious and I would still be friends with them because they were all I had. 

My mother was brutal in 7th grade. Last year. My step dad told her I was using my fathers death to manipulate her. She viciously degraded me. It was to a point If I was at school or a friends house all my perturbation was gone and once I returned home it hit me in the face all over again. They held me to the standards of a 16-18 year old because I'm 'pre-mature' and I guess one would be under these circumstances but sometimes I wish I could just be a normal and happy kid. But I try to think being this way gives me better opportunities for life. 

I met a friend who told me she was abusive, of course it was hard for me to believe that. She told me that abuse is human trafficking or being starved in a basement. And that was really my only vision of what abuse was. I think what hit the line for me was when she threw my phone at me in the shower, hit me across the face, called me a whore, bitch, selfish, fat, and other details I wish not to remember. 

Point is I'm at a point where I realize I can't live like this, and we won't have a sustainable relationship when I'm older. I could go on for hours about everything that's happened to me but I think this is enough. I don't wish to report her, and even so I have no evidence and my life would be hell. Please don't coax me to report her because I can't. I want ways to cope, help on my options for the future. My therapist and psych are kinda usless sadly. One blames my emotional problems on teenage hormones and the other just keeps repeating. ""And how does that make you feel?"" 

I originally wanted to get a scholarship and go off to college and threaten to cut contact unless she gets help. She's been on pills and they made her nice, she even came into my room and hugged me saying she thought she was bipolar and she wanted to get checked for me. Apparently she got mad she was 'relying on pills' and stopped taking them all at once and was sick for a week. And back to being horrible. 

Another reason Im unsure about my plan is because she told me when I'm 18 I get a sum of money and when I'm 21 it doubles. I'm scared of being broke and alone but I don't know if I can deal with her. I have a huge passion for writing, it's one of the only things I can say I am proud of and people have told me I have a gift for. And she called it BS and told me I needed to focus on more important things. I was crushed and wanted to sob. 

Please, don't tell me to report her, I can't, I just want help with coping and knowledge on my options and what I can do to make it through and I guess toughen up, I'm always told I'm sensitive. The reason I'm not suicidal is because I have hope of making it out and being happy in the future. But I don't know how. 


TL:DR- My mom is emotionally abusive and my sister is mentally screwed up, I'm traumatized and trapped. Read last paragraph.

fcl6z3,My girlfriend is abusive,"Hi guys...

So recently my gf (19F) and I (21F) have been getting into a lot of fights. (Please note, I have Bipolar I and BPD). Mainly, over me being abusive. I talked with my best friend of like 8 years about it, and we both agreed I’m the only one really working on improving myself. I’m on new medications, with a new therapist, and trying hard to be a better person overall. 

My girlfriend isn’t improving. She refuses to go to therapy (despite telling me if I didn’t, she would leave me), she refuses to work with me on our sex life, and she gets angry at me when I explain to her what I’m feeling (my therapist said she should help talk me out of that irrational frame of mind, she in no way does that. She tells me I’m just being over dramatic and abusive for thinking that).

Today we made plans after nearly 2 months of no sex to do so, but she cancelled and made plans with family instead. Ok, fine. I’ll take care of it alone. Thing is, this is a CONSTANT thing. We make plans, she cancels the plans.

I never yell when I tell her how I feel about her doing certain things. I explain to her calmly about how I feel a certain way. I’m not abusive in any way, shape, or form. I just try to work out our differences. But because of my BPD, and Bipolar I, she can’t “put up with it anymore” and as of today declared we take a break.

Frankly I’m so numb idk what or how to feel rn. I did nothing other then tell her how I feel about us never having a sex life.

TLDR; my girlfriend uses an ultimatum and tells me I’m abusive, not realizing her hypocrisy",jesscomplainz,2020-03-02 15:29:15,1,311,15.69,33.79,79.97,31.24,13.52,14.47,94.53,60.45,24.76,20.26,12.86,2.25,0,5.14,0,4.5,3.22,13.83,8.36,6.75,8.68,3.54,18.65,3.86,2.25,2.57,0.96,0.96,7.07,3.54,3.22,0.32,2.57,0.32,14.79,0.32,1.93,5.47,0.32,15.43,2.89,2.89,0.96,3.22,1.93,4.82,2.57,0,0.64,1.93,3.54,0,2.57,0.96,0,11.9,4.82,4.18,2.25,1.93,0,2.25,13.5,1.93,11.58,0.96,5.47,4.82,0.96,0.64,0.32,0,0,0,1.29,0,0.96,0.32,0,0.32,20.9,7.4,5.79,0,0.32,0,0,0,0.64,3.54,3.22,0
fcli3f,What just happened?!,"After months of my live-in boyfriend putting me down and getting irrationally angry, he finally snapped and broke my car door and some other things off of my car that make it function. Cops were called. I left for a week.

Then when I got back he pleaded with me to give him another chance because he didn't want to lose me. He knew he needed to change and needed counseling. He was sleeping on the couch but would come in my room every night to cuddle for an hour and talk about our days, occasionally we had sex. On Friday I told him he needed to follow through with the counseling appt or it was over. He sent me a picture of a counseling center and said he called to make the appointment and left a voicemail.

Friday night we had sex and he slept in our room with me. Saturday morning we had sex again and then I got depressed and spent the day in bed (I have bipolar depression). I didn't see him again until Sunday (yesterday) morning when I caught him swiping his Tinder. 

He asked me what I expected since I said I was single and changed my Facebook status. After I said ""you've been acting like you wanted to make it work and were going to change"" he retorted with ""I don't need counseling, I just need out of this relationship. I was only being nice to you because we live together and I didn't want to disrespect you."" When I brought up that it seems like he just wanted to get laid he said ""I wasn't sure what I wanted but now I am. Maybe I can't handle YOUR mental health issues."" 

This all happened in the span of one day. I told him he has until Thursday to get out of the apartment and I'm changing the locks. Until then I'm staying with a friend. He seems fine with all of this? It's like hes 2 different people and I feel super used and terrible. Like he doesn't give a shit about me all of a sudden and is throwing me away like garbage.

It seems like moving forward should be easy considering his behavior but that is not the case. I'm having trouble getting through work without crying.

fcolpp,I [F22] live with my abuser [M22] and two friends. I need to leave him. Concerned about risk.,"TW: abuse, violence, sexual violence

&amp;#x200B;

Almost straight after breaking up with my first love 9 months ago, I became involved with my (at the time new) housemate and current boyfriend. He was the best-looking person I'd ever met, he really seemed to understand violence against women (which I've suffered from in the past) and he seemed like the perfect man. We waited for 6 months to make it official.

&amp;#x200B;

Before we were together there were occasions that he acted abusively. I stood up for myself every time, stopped sleeping with him several times, and he showed signs of improvement (less frequent instances, less severe instances, not making the same 'mistake' more than twice). This made me think he'd changed and I felt like I had equal power even though he messed up sometimes. After making it official things were really nice for a few weeks, but since they have been really bad. He's acted verbally abusively towards me on numerous occasions, gaslights me constantly (even during the 'good' periods), and emotionally abuses me quite regularly. I am unable to stand up for myself now because it often leads to more or worse abuse and he is completely uninterested in changing. A few days ago he aggressively slammed a door I was stood right in front of twice in a row and it was so hard that it caused our housemates' entire room to vibrate.  


I want to leave him but it's difficult because I live with him. The tenancy agreement doesn't end until September and he has exams for his university course for the next few weeks then we have a break then I have my exams. I'm also worried about the risk of violence and more abuse. I've read 'Why Does He Do That' by Lundy Bancroft and it's amazing and has helped me recognize the situation I'm in. In his chapter about leaving abusers, he explains that even men who have never been physically abusive can become violent after breakups. He said that studies have shown that by far the most accurate predictor for future violence is the woman's gut instinct.

&amp;#x200B;

In my gut, I think it's possible he could be physically abusive towards me. I can't see severe violence occurring but I think he will definitely block me from leaving the room during discussions and spread rumours about me to friends. I can see him shoving/slapping/potentially even punching me and I'm worried about the impact that would have on my mental health and my exams. I can also see him being sexually violent. This is based on my gut feelings as well as his tendencies to go back on his word. So far every 'principle' he preaches he has betrayed. He preaches a lot about being anti-cheating, anti-using women for sex, anti-manipulation, anti-rape, and anti-physical domestic violence. I know for a fact he's done the first three to either me or previous partners, yet he'll still preach tirelessly against them and make special exceptions for himself. I'm also scared because, at the time, the door-slamming felt physically threatening and intimidating.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted the thoughts of others, please? I'm concerned and would like to hear from others who have been in similar situations.",_silly_billy_,2020-03-02 19:39:48,0,570,42.26,46.49,62.94,1,19,21.05,90.88,53.68,18.6,14.56,8.07,0.7,0,5.44,0.35,4.04,4.39,13.33,9.47,5.96,6.67,0.7,17.02,7.54,3.68,0.7,1.4,2.98,8.95,2.28,6.32,1.05,2.98,0.18,10.35,0,0.7,0.53,6.14,13.16,2.63,2.98,1.23,2.11,1.75,3.16,1.93,0.88,0.35,0.7,2.81,0.7,1.23,0.7,0,6.32,1.93,1.4,1.93,0.53,1.23,5.61,10.18,1.23,15.79,1.75,5.44,8.6,1.4,0,0.88,0,0.53,0,0.18,0,0,0,0.18,0,20.35,5.09,3.68,0.18,1.4,0.18,0,1.23,0,4.74,1.4,2.46
fcplzf,How much sexual abuse is enough to have an impact on someone?,"I'm having a hard time explaining myself in this post (not a native speaker) and I hope I don't make it too uncomfortable.

I was molested two times by two different strangers when I was a child. The first time it happened I was probably 5/6 years old and I remember a man masturbating in front of me while talking to me (I remember how this situation started but not how it ended), the second time a stranger touched me when I was around 7 years old.

I always wonder if not remembering how the first experience ended may be because of my mind represing the memory.

I've never gone to a therapist or psycologist in my adult life (bc I hate it), but I can tell I have mental problems. I don't know if those experiences may have influenced those problems or affected me or any other way because I feel like they were not a big deal.

 on saturday, i got blackout drunk and woke up in his bed in the next town over, fully naked. i have very little memory of what happened besides leaving my house and parts of him driving me there. he told me after that while i was there i told him that i loved him (which i do not) and that i wanted us to get back together (which i don’t). then we slept together this afternoon and tonight again. i just feel horrible about it. he was so terrible to me yet for some reason i still really want to see him.

fcvwlh,I feel so lost.,"My (21 F) boyfriend (28 M) has me feeling so alone and lost. 

We got into it again today. Except this time I just laid on the bed, staring at the wall while he screamed in my face and ear telling me to get the fuck up and face him while we were ""talking"". 

Im so tired. 

The man I loved and thought was this goofy, silly happy guy has turned into the monster of my own waking nightmare. When he's happy he's all of those things, he's caring and passionate and funny. We spend lots of time together and I can say in those moments I genuinely enjoy being with him and around him.

But when he's angry with me...its a whole different story. Usually during our fights theres yelling, and the usual insults and mockery but today i just layed there, im so tired of this and being told when I lay there and look at the wall I dont love him or care about him, that I hate him and want to provoke him. Usually when things get out of hand he will sometimes drag me out of bed and he very frequently puts his hands around my neck and just generally tosses me around our bedroom.

But today...today felt so much worse. He dragged me out of bed and straddled me on the floor while he pulled my hair and put both of his hands around my neck and pushed so hard everything felt a little fuzzy and my face felt like it was going to fucking explode. I was screaming and crying and although we live in a house with 4 others...no one seems to care. I feel like im overreacting and maybe if i just shut up and talked to him like he wanted this wouldnt be happening. 

I feel like I've gone from someone who was generally the egg in the boiling water vs. the potato as far as tough circumstances can go, and im so tired. I have no friends, he hates all of my family and gets extremely irrational if I contact them at all. I dont have hobbies and all I really do is my online courses and watch netflix and sit in our dark room. I dont know who i am anymore. I dont know whats normal in life. 

My last boyfriend, we'll call him A, of 3 years was killed in an atv accident in 2016, we had been together for the majority of high school, he broke his neck and was killed instantly. I feel it was highly traumatic for me and I havent really recovered
 
Ive had so much guilt assosciated with this because we were arguing that night, he was drunk, and i told him to leave. And leave he did. And never came back. All i can remember feeling as I looked at his broken body in the hospital was a mix of almost relief and just wishing I couldve said goodbye, or atleast dont leave. Ive felt its my fault for years now and have had a hard time coping, especially since he cheated on me and just generally didnt seem to want to be with me. We fought alot, and sometimes got physical but it was nothing like this. We were young and I thought i was managing to move on when I met my now boyfriend. He made me laugh so hard and after being completely alone and isolated in grief for years  it felt so good to laugh again. 

The worst part of this is my boyfriend now says he hated A, he was a loser, he didn't love me, and makes me agree with him. I now believe this and have a hard time thinking anyone could love me, if two guys now can find this many flaws clearly its me and not them right. For many months when we would fight he would tell me to go be with who i truly love, my ""dead loser"", and over time I've learned to tell myself I do hate  A, so that my bf will let it go and stop talking about it, and I can ""prove my love to him"". It just feels so wrong, i dont feel like i need to idolize A, and i dont think of him much anymore, it just makes me feel funny inside when I agree to these things.

I dont even know who I am anymore. I feel so lost and so far away. After he gets physical he tells me its human nature for my actions to lead to his actions, and that I made him escalate to that point. Then usually he will leave, and come back and cry to me apologizing and I will hold him and tell him its okay...what am i doing. Im not stupid...ive been on this sub for years...Ive told other people when theyre being abused and to get out. I know better, but he'll apologize and try harder for a couple days, and to feel like he loves me again is such a good feeling i try to forget about the physical stuff. although as soon as I say anything negative about him or our arguments he just calls me a martyr,bitch, baby, liar or something along those terms. 

I feel like garbage even saying this because I know what you will all say but I am also 6 months pregnant with his child. I find it hard to even be excited or think about it because life just feels so numb. His mom has also told me when he does that its not just his fault but mostly mine, and that i need to fix this.

 I constantly feel like im repairing his damage he does to himself, but he believes its my fault. When we fight he will hit himself or hit the wall or today he tried cutting himself while forcing my hand on the knife so that we could ""do it together since i want to hurt him so bad"" . 

Its getting to the point that I feel like every thing that doesnt even involve me remotely is my fault and i cant stop this victim mentality. Maybe its really not so bad and I really am just victimizing myself? This whole post just feels like my own pity party sob story, but i dont know  if i feel like that because I actually do..or because he's told me I feel that way and the lines between the two are so blurred i just have no way of knowing anymore. 

I just want to talk.

fcznu5,I can’t tell if I’m the abuser or the one being abused and it’s causing me great emotional turmoil to the point where I don’t have energy to do anything else,"Long story short, I have never felt this way about somebody before. When things were good, they were GREAT. I felt like I could be myself without being judged, we would make stupid jokes and laugh with each other all night long, we would stay in and play video games and cuddle for hours.   


Of course, this doesn't last. There was one thing we could never seem to agree and compromise on- arguing. She had some really toxic and unhealthy habits and language in the beginning. It would quickly get to the point where I was being called a bad boyfriend, being cussed out, being called names, etc. This obviously wore me out tremendously and after each time she would apologize, but it would just happen again. There were several instances that happened that stand out:  


1.  In the first month of dating, we were supposed to hangout on a Friday night. She went with some coworkers to the bar and got too drunk and had to be brought back home passed out. Her coworkers called me and I went to her place to take care of her. She began complaining about things and calling me names and being disrespectful, so I went home. 45 minutes later, I read a barrage of texts claiming how bad of a boyfriend I am to leave her drunk and all alone on a Friday night. She cussed me out. I thought, ""WOW, big red flag here, but our good times have been worth taking this chance and talking to her about it in the morning"" so i went back and we talked about it in the morning and she deeply apologized and said it would never happen again.  

2. We went to a hockey game and had some things to drink. After the game, we got into a silly argument at her apartment and I tried leaving her place. She blocked the door and wouldn't allow me to leave. I was holding chicken wings and the water bottle that she bought me for Christmas. She tried taking her water bottle back and ultimately ended up knocking the chicken wings all over the floor and continued to block the door until I called the police. The police arrived and asked me if I wanted to pres charges and I said no.  

3. We went out drinking again, and got into a small argument on the walk home. She had made fun of something that I had told her that was extremely personal and insinuated that it wasn't a big deal because I am a man and woman have it way worse. She insinuated it was nothing, so I walked her to my car, she got in, and I kicked her out and made her take an Uber home and that I would wait for her Uber to arrive. She wasn't happy. She cussed me out and slammed my door as hard as she could. She had to go back to my house to collect her purse and keys, which I had moved from my room down onto my front porch. I locked the door as I tried going to sleep. I woke up to several text messages and missed phone calls where she is cussing me out and telling me how horrible of a person I am and how she is going to throw everything I had at her house away so I can't get it, including some wiimotes that my Grandma bought me that have sentimental value. She just said, ""that sucks too bad."" Then, I hear pound after pound on my front door. She kicked out the screen on my front door and drove home.  

4. I have a sister who is mentally disabled who I am very protective of. Over memorial day weekend, we got into an argument and she called me a fucking retard straight to my face. She immediately started crying and profusely apologizing.  
I forgave her for all of these things. I am not perfect, either, although I haven't done anything close to this type of stuff. Things started improving little by little, but arguments would still be bad. Anytime I brought a problem up to her she would address it, but not without adding self pity to it. For example, if I told her, ""Hey, I feel like you have been distant lately. Is everything okay?"" She would say something like, ""Yes everything is fine! It's really frustrating though because I feel like no matter what I do you're just going to feel this way and it will never be good enough."" She would always twist it back to her and then I would have to comfort and reassure her of my feelings every time. Any time I brought up an insecurity, it was dismissed and I felt even more insecure about it after rather than better.   


I know that many of you may be reading this thinking I am an idiot for struggling with the separation, but things weren't always bad. Like I said, I had the most amazing times with this woman and I have never felt so closely connected with someone. We could stare at a wall and have fun together. Hours and hours of fun laying in bed, playing video games, texting on the phone, going out and doing activities, going to concerts, etc. She is the only person that I have ever actually felt like I could spend the rest of my life with and never have to second guess my feelings for her. I have some bad arguing tendencies, too, and I picked up on some of those from her when she wasn't able to speak and argue with me like a respectful adult.   


I can't help but feel as though I have been stuck in an abusive relationship emotionally and mentally, but I also can't seem to accept that we aren't together. Why do I still love someone like this? Was this a bad relationship? Can I just not see this because I'm emotionally blinded by being involved? Someone please tell me there is more to healthy relationships than this. Thanks so much for reading. Someone please knock some sense into me.

Additionally, I can’t hell but feel like I caused all of this and I’m just some narcissistic asshole who doesn’t even know it. 


TLDR- I think I’m in an abusive relationship and for some reason I am having trouble accepting that this relationship isn’t going to work. I want to continue to try and try and try, even though I know it is not right.

This is pertaining to incident 3. But, some of the texts she sent to me while drunk and angry were word for word:

“I’d rather fucking die than be with you”

“Goodnight shit head. Worst person I’ve ever met. Thanks for wasting a year of my life!”

“People like you are the reason we don’t come forward after being raped you piece of shit I can’t believe I thought I loved you”

Obviously, these are bad and even when I’m emotionally invested in the relationship I can see that....but the next several days she did nothing but apologize and assure me it didn’t mean anything and that she misunderstood what our argument was about, etc. I just keep hoping that things will change and there have been signs of improvement but it eventually just goes back to this",trueotterwaits,2020-03-03 11:11:05,5,1267,23.94,45.29,70.5,19.85,17.6,13.58,94.32,60.54,21.07,14.29,8.45,1.1,0.55,4.1,0.08,6.79,4.18,12.94,9.87,6,8.29,2.76,20.28,3.95,2.45,1.26,0.79,2.37,7.1,3.31,3.71,0.39,1.89,0.32,13.18,0.16,0.16,4.42,0.24,13.81,2.37,1.34,2.13,2.92,2.05,4.1,2.6,0.63,0.87,1.03,1.97,0.55,0.39,0.24,0.63,8.37,3.08,0.95,1.97,1.5,1.03,7.34,9.39,1.03,15.55,2.84,7.42,6.08,0.63,1.82,1.42,0.39,0.16,0.16,1.1,0.71,0.08,0.24,0,0,13.42,5.37,3.87,0.16,0,0.32,0.16,0.16,1.1,2.29,0,0

fd2t5w,How has abuse changed you?,"TW: child abuse / sexual abuse/ assault/ alcoholism 
-

-

It was a family member. I told my parents and they did not care. My older siblings told my parents. They still did not care. They did not want to choose between me and that family member. They never got me help. I was a child ages 3 - 9 when this was happening. At age 12, my attacker bragged about it to their friends at our house while we were on vacation and they were house sitting. Their friends called me and my family while we were on vacation asking if it was true. It ruined my vacation and my parents brushed it off, never even addressed the issue at all. They yelled at me for my behavior though. I'm an adult now and I can tell you healing is the hardest thing in the world for victims of this situation. There were moments where people told me I was a horrible ""drama queen"" (my mother puts it) because of my blind rage/temper. They would purposely torment me and push my buttons. And when I acted out they would fuck with me more. Now that they are out of my life (most of my family, not all.) I can honestly say it gets better. It just really sucks trying to emphasize/relate with humans when minor things happen to them. Every day I feel as if I have to put on this facade in order to blend in and be ""human."" I no longer have any feelings except rage. I try my hardest to feel sad when horrible things happen to me and I cry. I do not cry because I'm sad or enraged, I make myself cry to try to feel the sadness that another normal human should feel  but I end up rolling my eyes thinking this is a waste of time.
Horrible occurrences took place after my childhood (another assault/more abuse from my alcoholic parents, an abusive relationship) and I told my friends and they actually wanted me to be sad about it. My outlook in life now is :hey that happened, and I could honestly not care less. I try my hardest everyday to feel something but I just can't. I have to fake cry in front of people in order for them to think that I actually have feelings but it is not genuine. The next minute after I cry I feel nothing and I act normal. It freaks my friend out. (The one friend that I shared all my trauma with) I am living a lie and no one knows it within my friend group/family (that I still talk to)  This shit changes you, and sometimes for the better, most times for the worst. My therapist says I show signs of sociopathic tendencies due to my trauma. Does that make me a murderer/psycho killer? No. There are hundreds, if not thousands of people out there like me. It's really horrific that most mental illnesses can be traced back to child abuse. Be safe out there and if you honestly think about hurting a child in any way, shape, or form you should not even be allowed on this earth.

Genuine Question:

Does anyone else have this problem? Trying to blend in with this world and putting on a facade so people around you don't break down your walls and realize you have ""no soul"" due to your trauma?",yannau40,2020-03-03 14:30:37,4,580,25.49,32.7,94.99,1,15.26,13.79,95.17,58.45,22.41,15.86,11.38,0.52,1.55,0,2.41,6.55,3.1,12.59,7.93,5.52,6.9,3.1,17.07,5.52,3.1,1.03,1.21,2.59,9.14,2.07,7.07,0.52,3.28,1.9,13.1,1.9,1.03,0.34,0,14.31,3.1,1.55,2.07,3.45,1.55,4.48,3.28,0.52,0.52,2.24,2.24,0.34,1.55,0.34,0.34,9.48,4.31,1.55,2.93,0.86,0.52,4.14,10.69,0,13.97,1.38,6.72,5.52,0,1.9,1.21,0,0.17,0.34,0.86,0.69,0,0,0,0,14.48,5.86,1.9,0.52,0,0.69,0,0.52,1.03,0.86,1.72,1.38
fd3s77,Should I contact people I don’t know to tell them that a family member of my husband’s has made a threat towards them?,"Not sure if this is the best sub for this but here goes anyway. 

My husband’s cousin (D) is currently in jail for molesting children, including a child who his mother (my husband’s aunt, L) calls her grandchildren. They are the grandchildren of a former partner of hers and as she doesn’t have grandchildren of her own, she has kinda ‘adopted’ them. L loves them and spends a lot of time with them and moved to live near them. 

D is coming out of jail soon and will be living with L. So this means that he won’t be allowed to be at the house when the ‘grandchildren’ come over. I have heard second hand that L has made comments like ‘D shouldn’t have to leave, it’s his home’, but I don’t believe there is a choice there, like it’s a legal requirement. He will be monitored by police. 

But the thing that has really disturbed me is that I was told that L said that the mother of the children better not cause trouble for her son because she knows things about her (apparently she has cheated on her partner). So not only has D done something to them that has changed their lives forever, L has also stated that she is willing to destroy their family unit if they don’t stay quiet about it. 

This was told to me second hand, but I absolutely trust the person who told me. I am the mother of a child (from a former marriage) who was molested and so I’m particularly sensitive to this as I know the impact it has. So I feel like I’m in a moral dilemma as to whether I tell these people I don’t know about this threat, or whether I stay quiet as it’s my husband’s family. 

I will also add that L is very selfish and a major trouble maker and has done a few things that have impacted my husband and I negatively so I don’t feel any particular loyalty to her, although her other son is like my husband’s brother. She also apparently was molested as a child by a family member so I find her attitude confusing. I have a young daughter who has had contact with this family member and they didn’t tell me, I was told by someone else. 

Asking for advice because I feel that my feelings towards her and previous history of this may be convincing me to stick my nose where it doesn’t belong, and at the same time I feel all children should be protected.

fd8pm2,How to Talk to my Mom when I’m Afraid of her?,"My household is very toxic to live in and my mom can be kind of abusive at times. My parents haven’t had a healthy marriage for as long as I can remember, and there are yelling matches between them daily, and have been violence between them from both sides on rare occasion. I think my mom takes the stress of this out on me, and a lot of our conversations end up with her yelling quite nasty things to me. She hasn’t actually hit me in a little while, so it’s not that bad, but my anxiety just gets so bad any time I talk to her. I can’t find it in me to disagree either, even expressing small negative opinions angers her and freaks me out. I get that fight or flight response any time she speaks to me, and try to get myself out of the conversation quickly before it becomes too much to handle. But she has started to notice this and become angry at me for not wanting to talk to or have a relationship with her and “treating her like dirt.” It makes things worse for me, but talking to her is hard because I’m honestly just so afraid of her, even if I shouldn’t be. How do I find a balance for this and make it through everyday conversations? I need a strategy to cope with this.

As a note, I see a therapist, and as soon as I’ve started to bring up bad things about my mom and they’ve tried to facilitate discussion about these between the two of us, my mom switches who I’m seeing. This has happened twice so I’m on #3, who I actually really like and don’t want to lose, so I can’t really bring it up with her. 

I’m also 16 and a junior in high school, so I can’t move out yet. On top of those two things, I’m dealing with some possibly life-threatening medical issues related to my immune system, which makes me afraid to tell anyone about what’s going on. Despite her flaws, my mom takes me to hospital and doctors appointments when needed to make sure I’m going to be okay and I’m afraid this wouldn’t be handled if I were to be in someone else’s custody. I really just want to find a way to cope with this until I can go to college, and get out of here. I’ve been doing it fine so far even if it’s taken work, but my mom has just seemed to become more angry and much more controlling lately. I think my health issues might be to blame for this mood shift, but I can’t do anything about that.

fd9ogb,Social Worker Failed Me,"Last week, I end up in the psych unit again for the second time in a year.
I hate it! I don't want to be that depressed where I made stupid decisions to kill myself.

My husband called the cops on me after we had this stupid argument which shouldn't end up him calling the cops on me. He wanted to talk about drama at 2am after he had panic attack around 11pm. I asked him so many times if he needs anything or if there is anything I can do for him, he kept on brushing it off. Which ended up that he told me that responsible for the feeling that he had. That he didn't feel love by me. Of course I got upset, because I already reached out to him couple times that night.

The argument escalated and he threaten to die or disappeared. I got so upset that if he died, I will be more responsible if he decided to kill himself. After long arguments that he will let our dogs stayed with me to keep me safe, I told him to leave my place, since we have been living separately 2.5 months ago. He refused and kept on making excuse to leave the dogs with me. I told him to take them, because I know that he would feel safe if he has them. He kept on refusing. I got so devastated and he just won't leave and I made decisions to end my life that day. He tried to rescued me by taking the knife. And he called the cops instead of giving me the space that I asked him so I can call my sister to feel safe in my apartment.

The cops came and took me to the hospital. And When they took me there, they asked me to get detoxicated because I had couple drink before I had the fight. My husband also accused me that I was drunk and wasn't able to control my emotion. The nurse came took my blood and got breathalyzer and everything was tested negative for alcohol. 

I was devastated because I ended up in the hospital for same reason. After waiting for almost 4 hours, a social worker came to talk to me. On the first time in my life, I felt I should just die after I talked to her. She lied and told me that my alcohol level was high between 0.6 or 0.8. She also told me that ""why is it about you when you told him already that he had panic attack?"". So I just stare out to the sky and was haunted by guilty feeling that I should just die. I can't believe that this social worker lied to me about my alcohol level and blamed me for something that I should be more empathize my husband even though I already tried to be compasionate, but since he responded differently and everything had to be on his time and on his term, I was stuck because I can't even takecare myself when I should.
For the first time I felt the system failed me. 

But after that, I talked to the psychiatrist and I mentioned it to her what the social worker told me. And I felt relieved because I asked her if I'm being delusional when the nurse told me that everything tested negative for alcohol. I felt that I had become crazy. I felt lost, but I'm glad that psychiatrist clear things up and told me that the social worker was failed me. I hope she will get fired or something.

After I got out from the hospital, I felt better. When I came home, my husband came over. I become so tense and froze inside my Uber and I can't think. Every part of my body become tense and I was fearful for my own being for things that he had put me through all this time. I was afraid that he will come back to myself and tried to bring me down to the ground and make me feel the way I feel that I am the crazy one.

I do have major depression since I was a kid as well. My mom would blame on me on everything that happened to her. As I grew up, I constantly end up with someone that was doing the same thing. And I'm marrying someone that is doing the same thing. Blaming on me on every feeling that they had. 

I got so exhausted. I don't know why this is keep on happening to me. I'm trying to figure out things now and hoping I will be able to be better about my life. 

I'm filing my divorce and restraining order on my husband, because I can't live the way I was living when I was a kid. It is too depressing. And I decided to be happy now, because I know that by setting a boundary from other that bring me down change my life.

I'm trying to live happier and healthy life. It is not an easy journey, because sometimes that trauma will take you back to where you should be. And make you feel unworthy to live this life because you were never enough for the people that you actually love and care.",cececela3,2020-03-03 23:43:45,2,892,17.41,32.3,84.66,2.66,16.22,11.77,96.64,64.35,27.24,20.07,13.9,0.34,0.78,4.48,0.56,7.17,4.15,13,9.08,5.38,7.96,1.57,21.41,4.04,2.02,1.46,0.9,1.01,6.73,2.02,4.6,1.12,1.91,1.01,12.67,0.9,0,1.01,4.26,12.22,3.25,2.58,2.13,2.47,1.01,2.91,2.24,0.34,0,1.91,3.25,0.34,2.47,0,0.67,8.74,1.91,2.24,3.59,1.79,0.78,10.31,8.74,1.01,13.68,1.79,6.05,6.05,1.68,0.78,0.22,0,0,0.67,0.11,0,0,0,0.11,0,10.43,5.94,2.24,0,0,0.11,0.11,0,0.22,1.79,0,0

fdegcy,How could she turn on her own family?,"I dont know if this is the right forum, but here goes. 

I recently found out my significant other was involved in a very abusive relationship. Short story, she got involved with the wrong person and before she knew it she was caught with a partner who beat her, raped her and what not. Despite this she stayed with him for a good while until she managed to escape the situation. 

One of the things that I am really struggling to understand is how her abuser managed to make her turn on her own family and isolate her from them to the point where she even got a restraining order against them after they protested against the relationship when they saw the ill effects it had on her.

She has always had a very loving bond with her family, which is why it is so confusing to me that a stranger who she had known for a short time managed to turn her against her own family like that. Specially when her family was so worried about our safety and well being and did everything they could to help her from the situation she was in. Was it shame? Fear? I really want to understand this better.

The reason why I am worried about this fact from her past is that I am thinking that if she was so easily manipulated by one person to turn against her own family, who is to say she wont do the same to me? How can someone be so easily manipulated?  Granted she was young when it happened, around 18, but this stills bothers me a lot. So I just hope someone can shed some light on the psycology behind this.",FormalVisit,2020-03-04 07:19:19,2,296,24.2,86.02,5.03,6.76,19.73,13.51,94.26,66.22,24.32,15.54,3.72,0.34,0,9.8,1.69,8.78,6.42,14.19,10.14,8.45,7.43,1.01,18.24,3.72,2.03,4.73,1.01,0.68,7.09,2.7,4.39,2.03,1.69,0.34,19.59,2.03,0.34,9.46,0.34,14.19,3.04,3.38,2.03,2.7,1.01,4.39,1.01,0.68,0.34,0,0.68,0,0.34,0.34,0,9.46,4.05,0.68,3.38,1.35,1.01,8.45,9.12,0.68,11.82,2.7,5.07,4.05,1.01,2.03,2.03,0,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,0.34,0,7.43,3.38,2.36,0,0,1.69,0,0,0,0,0,0
fdhzft,"I don't know if this belongs here, but here goes...","So, a little bit of backstory, my mom was a very abusive person. She had full custody of me, and my dad lived in another state. She would yell at me, call me names, and punch me. And i couldn't really do anything about it. Eventually once I graduated, turned 18, and got a job, i ran away to a church I went to, with a apartment in the back for recovering addicts. I lived there for a few months, but i had to ask permission for where i could go, and my money was kept away in a safe.  Then the dad and stepmom of my high school friend found out, and got my dad involved and brought me out, and I'm currently living with them and my friend.

I'm 19 now, going to school for welding, and gave lived here for a year and a half, and we all work at the same restaurant. Thing with my current situation is that I'm unhappy. They said they'd let me be my own adult, and let me do whatever, with only kinda their opinions. This was a lie. If i made certain mistakes I'd get yelled at, whereas if it were the son, he wouldn't get yelled at. They tell me to keep my phone off at home because they say it takes up too much internet, where apparently my friend can have his tv streaming hulu and be playing League at the same time. They even ssy the most aggressive things about me whenever I overhear them. And for the past few months I've been stressed because I was worried I'd be yelled at for something, and that has caused me to make more mistakes, get yelled at more, and to top it off, they won't let me be around my girlfriend, who I work with and is the sweetest woman I've ever met, because apparently I've been ""distracted by her."" Along with that, they were threatening to ship me over to my dad's when my college semester is done. I also don't even have my driving permit because they haven't taken me to get it.

I've been talking to my dad and sis about it for a few months now. My dad told me I should get my own place. I'm fine with that, I'm just worried about how things will go down, and I'm worried about getting stuff like medical insurance, or if I'll survive.ive been trying to talk to my dad more, but he hasn't responded.

fdj5so,My relationship is suffering because my girlfriend was abused in the past.,"My girlfriend and I have had long-term intimacy issues for almost 2 years now. From the time she was born until she was 7 she was repeatedly sexually abused by her sociopathic father. Although she doesn’t remember any of this, the trauma still runs deep, and our sex life is nonexistent. I understand the need for patience and healing and all of that. But that doesn’t make the lack of intimacy in our relationship any less difficult. We used to have lots of great sex when we started dating. Then it became less and less frequent. One time we tried to have sex and she couldn’t get turned on because she kept thinking about her dad. Sometimes she has phantom pains. She can’t even masturbate anymore. 

Is there anyone here who has personal experience with this? How did you/are you getting through it? What resources are out there that can help my girlfriend move past her inner trauma and reconnect with her own sexual desires? Therapy is really expensive (and she’s actively trying to get it) but it’ll take more than that. I fear that by the time she is healthy again, my needs will have been neglected for so long, that I just want out of this. Our relationship is open but that doesn’t negate the fact that we just aren’t connecting on that deeply physical and intimate level anymore. 😔 please help with insight, wisdom, love, and light.",GVNESHA,2020-03-04 12:28:05,1,253,13.54,81.84,19.36,19.84,14.06,18.18,94.86,58.5,20.95,12.65,3.56,2.77,0.79,5.53,0,8.3,2.77,10.67,11.86,5.93,8.3,2.77,21.34,4.74,1.98,1.58,1.19,3.16,7.11,3.16,3.56,0.4,0.79,0.79,15.02,0.79,1.19,5.53,0.79,13.44,2.37,1.98,2.37,2.77,0.79,3.16,1.19,0.4,0,0.4,4.74,0,1.98,2.37,0,10.67,6.72,0.79,0.79,2.37,0.79,6.72,13.44,1.19,14.62,1.19,5.14,8.3,0.4,0,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.62,5.93,2.77,0,0,1.19,0,0.4,0,3.16,0.79,0.4
fdjci6,Need help figuring out past,"I've been doing some writing about some past experiences and I'm realizing that I'm having trouble accepting that I was ""sexually assaulted"" because of some of my actions. I’m not sure if this is the right sub but we’ll give it a go. Also, for background info, i also had an experience when I was younger in which my dad occasionally bathed with me and he once got on top of me with a towel on and kissed my neck in a sexual way which is also confusing for me and seems similar in a way... it’ll make sense after you read. And another disclaimer, I do have a sex addiction which makes me wonder if that played a part as well. Anyways 


There were three instances that I'm not sure how I feel about... the first was that I invited a guy over to my house. I honestly didn't want to have sex with him and I'd decided that and told him that. I just wanted to mess around. At one point he tried to have sex with me and I said no and I went to the other room. I felt kind of weird and uncomfortable. He followed me to the room and got in front of me where I sat and talked to me and then just had sex with me. I didn't do anything and I didn't stop it. Then after I tried to make it feel like everything was fine so I took a shower with him and acted happy.


The second time was that I was at a party and definitely drank too much so I can't remember everything. I know I was flirting with a guy, just for attention, I wasn't really interested in him. Eventually he somehow convinced me to go to a room with him and I told him I didn't want to have sex but we made out (I remember this because I was on my period) and I told him that and he took my tampon out and had sex with me. And I probably acted like I enjoyed it. To make everything seem ok. Then I feel asleep and the next morning I had sex with him willingly.


The third time is one that really bothers me because this was a good friend of mine. I flirted with him a lot but I wasn't into him, again probably just for attention. I went to a party at his house, all his cousins were there (I was friends with the family as well), and there was a lot of drinking. They were pressing a lot of alcohol on me and I eventually just went to a bed to lay down. I guess I threw up in the bed beside me though I don't remember it. at some point my friend comes in and starts messing around with me. He touched me and went down on me but I know we didn't have sex because he's a Virgin. But I'm pretty sure I acted like I liked it. Which bothers me a lot. Then the next morning I let him drive me home and then we were still friends and acted like nothing happened. It's all just very confusing for me and I definitely feel like all of these instances are my fault. I’m not looking for people to feel bad for me, I just honestly do not understand why I did these things? And how it wouldn’t be my fault? 


And it also bothers me that sometimes I think back to these instances and get turned on by them which is very disturbing to me. I have started to crave these instances. These all happened awhile ago but I do think of them a lot. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

fdk7bk,Sexual abuse?,"When I (female) was about 6 years old I had a 13 y.o. best friend (also a female). 
  We had many games, but one day she came up with a whole new game. We played out many different making out scenes, where she played the male and I played the female. She told me that I can't tell anyone and that it is our secret. Of course I agreed. 
  I can't remember, how far this game went, because I only remember some bits. I remember what it felt like to make out with someone who had braces. I remember wearing just my underpants and a top. But I can't remember anything else, and it feels like those couple of years are just cut out from my life.  
  And not remembering bothers me, because I'll never know, how far we went. And the other thing that bothers me is that I can't be sure if it's sexual abuse or not, because I kissed her willingly, she didn't force me. 
  It's about ten years later now and I am still not sure of anything. I started thinking about it again only, because I have trouble connecting to people emotionally and have slight psychopathic tendencies, so I wondered, if things are connected.

fdkvpb,I am an adult who is just now remembering sexual abuse by an older cousin as a child and I am spiraling. Do I bring this up in counseling given the specifics of my situation?,"I am in my late 20's. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and I have been seeing a counselor for the last 6 months or so. I think my mental health has been well the last year or so, and I have figured out how to manage my GAD (which has always been considered moderate to high). As I've gotten older, it has become more and more moderate most likely because of the things I've found to help better manage it. 

Last night, I was watching the R. Kelly documentary, ""Surviving R Kelly,"" and all of the sudden, I found myself extremely anxious and trying not to cry. Basically, this documentary triggered me. I started thinking about my cousin who is 3 years older than me. I used to go to her house every day after school as a kid in elementary school from maybe 4th to 5th grade? Maybe longer? I don't remember. But...I think that she sexually abused me. I think I've always known this, but maybe I just pushed it down out of my brain. But now,  I am remembering and I can't stop crying. 

I don't have really clear or vivid memories though. They're all blurry. I just remember kissing and touching in private areas. I don't think back then or to this day, we've ever discussed any of this. She isn't a person who is in my life anymore either, although the reason is not related to this. I just don't know how I feel. I am a counseling student, and I've learned all about trauma-informed counseling and the after-effects of trauma... but, how was I affected by this? Is this something I should talk about with my counselor if I don't even really know how it's affected me or my life? I don't even know how many times it happened. I couldn't even describe one specific memory. But I am still sitting here, crying because I KNOW it happened. And I'm spiraling because I'm overthinking some of the interpersonal problems I do have, and questioning if its because of this? 

She and I stopped being close when I transferred schools in 6th grade, but we became close again in high school. What happened between us was never brought up, and nothing like that ever happened again. Right now... I feel afraid. And shameful. And guilty. Logically, I know that I shouldn't be ashamed. I didn't know what we were doing. She was my older cousin, and really I thought like a best friend. I remember after her doing these things to me, that sometimes I think I would initiate them back. Does that me a bad person?

I can't even imagine saying any of these things out loud to my counselor. I don't really know what I'm looking for from this post, but I had to do something and since I don't feel like I can or want to tell anyone, here I am, going to reddit.",selfcritic,2020-03-04 14:18:54,1,531,6.99,7.63,99,4.62,12.64,15.25,96.23,63.28,22.98,15.82,13.75,0.75,0,1.13,0.19,7.16,3.39,10.92,11.86,8.1,9.6,3.39,22.6,5.27,3.95,2.45,0.75,2.26,3.58,0.75,2.82,1.13,0.38,0.56,7.53,0.56,0.19,1.13,0,22.03,7.34,3.2,1.51,4.33,2.64,5.46,2.07,0.94,0.38,0.75,1.13,0.19,0.56,0.38,0,6.03,1.88,0.94,2.64,0.56,0.75,6.4,13.37,0.38,12.99,1.13,4.33,7.72,3.39,0.38,0.19,0,0,0,0.75,0,0.56,0,0.19,0,19.59,7.91,4.52,0,0,1.32,0,0.38,0.38,4.71,0.38,0

She contacted me the other day after he spent two days in the guest room refusing to speak to her (this was after a misunderstanding about sitting next to each other at a hockey game) she said he is actively saying/doing hurtful things like “our marriage is glass and you broke it” “if we need another person (therapist) to fix our marriage we shouldn’t be together in the first place” he also doesn’t like when she hangs out with my other sister and I because he’s convinced she’s talking shit about him (constantly) this girl is my everything and I understand I can’t rescue her but I can’t sit here and let this happen.

His a bit hot and cold in my eyes. Since I was 9 10sh to 12 my brother had sexually touched me both when I was awake and when he assumed I wasn’t awake. Don’t know if there was some when I just wasn’t aware. How he got this close to me and touched me well my brother and I and much younger my elder brother as all sorta irl role played our I guess ocs (we had no idea about ocs and role play so we had no idea how unoriginal we were). And these talks would tend to go on for hours and so happen also take place at night. So sometimes we’re would share the bed so we could talk /role play. My brother has a tendency to just drop me like a soggy towel for time periods when he just doesn’t talk to me. This rp session was my only real way of talking about my special interest so I was desperate for him to talk to me. So one thing led to another we were playing truth or dare and he dared me to touch he dick and well I did because I was so excited that he wanted to talk to me. And then he touched me and well soon it became if you want to talk and rp you have to touch my privates. Then it progresses to he assumes I am asleep and moves his hand down my pants and moves my hand down his basically trying to get me do stuff. We never had sex just touching it just now I feel it is affecting me and I feel guilty because now he’s not doing it but he’s sorta my best friend. We still rp and talk and he’s changed (many mental health and anger problems addressed by professionals now so doing much better). But I still feel horrible and want to tell someone about these events especially the ones he assumed I was asleep. But he’s going through enough problems and I don’t want to hurt him.

fdrhw4,Am I being abused?,"I got married in December 2018 against my parents wishes to the man whom I assumed was the ideal man for me. 

Things were great for first few months but then he started changing. He started getting angry with me for the smallest of things and then slowly things became my fault. More importantly, he keeps acting up whenever it comes to my parents not spending on him because he's their son in law. 

Granted it took 6 months for my parents to come around but once they did, they started treating him kindly and respectfully. They sent him a birthday cake on his birthday, they took us on a family trip to bangkok and singapore (we didn't spend a single penny), they gave him around $1000 as gift on christmas. 

He had problems with everything. He has a problem of why they're not spending more on us; specifically him. Now this anger gets turned to me and he starts acting rough with me whenever he gets angry at something my parents do (ie: which in his eyes is that they do not give him money and respect). He ignores me and if I try to talk to him he pushes me and shoves me and even kicked me at one point. 

He demands sexual intimacy from me, even when I'm sick and not up for it. Even when I was very sick and Doctor told me no sexual activity, he still demanded I please him even though I kept telling him I'm in a lot of pain. 

Even when I try to tell him how much I'm hurt he turns it around on me that I'm the reason that he behaved like he did and caused myself to be hurt. Two months ago he lost his temper and threatened to kill my entire family and I if I don't get my act together when all I did was get excited for christmas celebrations and my brother's upcoming nuptials. 

Two weeks ago he kicked me in the stomach and a couple of days ago while we were walking down the street after groceries and he got angry when I was trying to help him with the bags so he proceed to yell at me that he'll slap me if I don't shut my mouth. 

I'm his punching bag for everything that goes wrong and throughout everything I've always stood by him even when he was having a financial struggle. I'm so emotionally drained and exhausted that stuff I liked to do before my marriage I have no interest in anymore. 

All I want now is to just get away from him. He's a source of anxiety for me and it's messing up with my health a lot.

fdvw8r,Child abuse,"First Time Poster. Non native english speaking person. 

I discovered this subreddit and now I want to share.

I come from an abusive Household. Father is emotionally and physically abusive towards his children. Mother was for a long time my only person to call family. I moved out 3 years ago and can now see clearly that she's abusive as well. Just hides it better (think guilt tripping and playing victim) and masking it as motherly love. 
I confronted both of them like almost two years ago how much their parenting screwed me up. My father was very apolegetic (i don't know i was causing you so much pain etc.) and my mother started to cry. She claimed she never knew of the physical and emotional abuse but refused to divorce my father since she always has been a housewife  and never actually worked a day in her life (it's very common that way where we originally came from). 
I thought it was all good after that. I've seen a therapist for two years for my ptsd and I confronted my parents and all should be good, right? 
Well No, i have two younger siblings. Sister (17 years old) and Brother (5 years old). Sister is going to therapy as well for depression and her therapist wanted me there for a session. My sister and I are not particularly close but i do want to help her so I agreed to it. 
There I found out that my father still abuses my sister (mentally) and my brother (physically when he doesn't behave). I felt like someone just punched me in the stomach. 
I'm considering going full nc with my parents because I'm just done with all their shit and just calling CPS on them.

fdwiem,It doesn’t matter how nice someone’s abuser was to you,"“It happens every time.
In 2017, when Harvey Weinstein was first embroiled in his numerous sexual assault charges, it was Lindsay Lohan of all people, who took up the charge.
“He never harmed me or did anything to me. We’ve done several movies together. I think everyone needs to stop. I think it’s wrong. So, stand up.”
When presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg was asked, a few weeks ago, about the numerous non-disclosure agreements he’s had women sign, he pointed out how many women have been given management positions in his company.
“I’ve been nice to some women” Elizabeth Warren correctly translated.
When men abuse women, there will always be someone who comes out of the weeds and describes ‘what a nice man he’s been the whole time I’ve known him’.
And the truth is – I’m happy for these people. They were in the presence of a shark that chose not to bite them. But their lack of bite marks doesn’t disprove that other women were wounded.
And this is overwhelmingly a gendered issue. While not all abusers are men, obviously, it is almost exclusively men who receive this type of benefit of the doubt. We just don’t like to change our opinions on guys we generally like. It’s much easier to play devil’s advocate, especially if the alleged victim is some chick we hardly know.
But victims of abuse will often heartily agree; their abuser was lovely to everyone else. Often, that’s a key element of their ability to abuse – their supposed charm. When they are ‘lovely’ to everyone who knows them, it’s even harder for a victim to come forward. Who’s going to believe you? Who’s going to take your side? And if he’s abusive to you but kind to his friends and colleagues – doesn’t that mean there’s something wrong with you?
The short answer is no.
The long answer is fuck no.
Abusers are not lovely people – and the violence they impose upon their victim is not the victim’s fault. Ever. You cannot turn someone into an abuser by spilling a cup of coffee, or not making their dinner on time, or denying them sex. They chose to behave that way – and no one else is responsible for that behaviour, much as they will say it’s your fault. Put it this way: does he hit his colleagues if they make a mistake in the office? Does he strike people in the street?
The way abusers are spoken of in the press betrays a frightening naiveté on this subject, and we desperately need to get better at reporting on violent crime. We need to pivot away from the ‘good bloke who snapped’ narrative, like yesterday. We need to pivot away from describing abusers’ successful careers, what doting fathers they were, or how nice they were to their friends.  
At best, it’s poor reporting. At worst, it’s openly cruel to victims of abuse. And that includes the people currently facing abuse. They will be watching how this latest story unfolds. They will be taking notes. And if we tell them to stay in the shadows, many of them will.
When we claim that an abuser was a ‘good bloke who snapped’, we reinforce the idea, whether subtly or bluntly, that victims are somehow to blame. And that’s bullshit.” 

TL;DR / DISCLAIMER: this is an article I saw and it made me feel 1000x better about the abuse I’ve endured and the amount of people who denied it because “he wouldn’t hurt a fly”. I hope it helps some of you guys too &lt;3

I’m in high school, and my mother has always been very straightforward about sexuality, and normally not in a good way.

She walks around the house naked and never closes the bathroom door, and no matter how much I express my uncomfortable with it she’ll either yell at me for complaining or make fun of me.

When I was going through puberty she would always constantly ask me to show her my genitals, and she would just grab me at random times, even after I’ve told her to stop. This has been happening for as long as I can remember. However, recently, she has toned it down, most likely because I’m now stronger than her and could overpower her.

This morning, however, I was struggling to get out of bed as I’ve been really sick lately, and she stormed into my room, screaming my head off, and then she pulled off the covers and tried pulling down my underwear numerous times.

I just don’t know if this is normal and I’m overreacting or if I should tell somebody. In the recent months I’ve been incredibly depressed, and that’s largely due to my mother.

fe4bau,Is this gaslighting? Or what is it called?,"He came home from work. I told him we needed to go shopping for food because I didn't know what to feed our toddlers. (Feeding them has been a huge source of stress and he knows it but he only criticizes everything i feed the kids rather than making suggestions or helping at all.) He says we can go shopping another day, he just doesn't feel like going. 
 Any time I tell him we need something essential (or anything at all), he always tries to push off getting it until another day. He has always done that even when we are almost out of formula and I'm not sure how long the remaining amount will last. He asks if it will last until the next day but i never know and it really stresses me out when I don't know if the baby will have enough formula until he can pick some up the next day and bring it home. 
 I was upset that he was delaying as always, without any actual reason. I told him that he always does this but he denied it and got angry at the suggestion that his unnecessary delay causes undue stress for me. He then yelled, ""I've been at work all day! Are you mad that I've been gone working all day?"" Uh, no, we were fighting about him always being resistant to him getting absolute essentials in a timely manner. I definitely didn't say a word about him not being home or working all day. 
 It's not uncommon for him to do this. We'll be fighting about something and then he acts like I'm mad about something totally different, painting himself in some innocent light as if he was doing something good and I got mad about that instead of what I'm really mad about.

fe4qmr,Met someone who showed clear warning signs.,"I matched with a man on tinder recently who was super charming and made me feel good. Very attractive man, very well spoken and sweet. I spent the last few nights with him having a great time at first but then things took a dark turn. He brought up wanting to make copies of a key and I just asked why because I was genuinely curious so he got very angry and defensive and got really upset and started being nasty towards me asking why I was questioning his motives. He calmed down but as the night went on he got more aggressive. I offered to help with his laundry and when I didn’t put his fitted sheet on right and made a joke about being incompetent, he got very very angry and started being passive aggressive saying I shouldn’t have offered to help. That he couldn’t understand why I couldn’t put a sheet on. How he’d do it himself. Then he started blaming me for him being upset. Then when we talked about him taking me home he said I was basically inconveniencing him and should have brought it up earlier. I felt forced to stay another night with him. He made me feel very scared and unsafe and pressured. Not to mention the times I felt sleepy and he forced sex upon me. After he calmed down he told me he loved me and wanted to be with me and I didn’t say anything back because I knew what was happening. I’m terrified to see this man again. Am I being unreasonable or are these red flags? I feel like not knowing each other long and him being so aggressive is a huge red flag.

I’m so scared to break things off, even block him. We live an hour away from each other but he knows my location. I didn’t mean to get myself in this position...

fe54w4,Is this abuse?,"Tl;dr mom might be emotionally abusing me because she doesn’t understand trans stuff and I’m trans

I’m 16, a trans guy. I used to be really lazy and stuff so that kinda messed with the relationship between my mum and me, but otherwise we got along pretty well. We both have adhd but lately I keep trying to do good and adhd keeps making it so I mess up (I’ll think ‘get the dishes done and I can go to bed’ and I’ll forget the counters and sweeping), so she thinks I’m still being lazy. That’s not the big issue it’s just a factor.. my mum found out I’m trans but I won’t confirm it (dress masc, pass to strangers sometimes, so ig she could’ve guessed but no, she’s sure). Sometimes she yells at me and insults me. Rarely but still, it seems to be getting more regular. How I know she knows is not long after realizing I’m trans and starting to make myself more comfortable with myself (being masc and stuff), she confronted me. She said basically lgbt will lead to cannibalism and I won’t believe her until it’s too late (last year she said she was and still seems fine with me being bi, or at least alright) and not to tell my friends because they might’ve been raised different. That was a while ago and because it was messing with me and I can’t change that I’m trans or anything I stopped thinking about it. On Sunday she found out my friend is also a trans guy, and figured I’m crushing on him and so I’m copying him, and that he’s trying to be a boy because his mom is a tomboy so she wanted him to be a boy so he decided to try to be a boy. Completely wrong. We weren’t friends until this year, and I realized I was trans this summer. All we have in common style wise is flannels and we’re both masculine. He has a few brothers and he was the only female child, so his parents and especially dad wanted him to be a girl but they try to be supportive it seems. So anyways, she’s decided if I don’t go back to being a girl and my authentic self and to not tell anyone it’s ‘just to make her happy’ (once said I’d be femme but only to make her happy which she didn’t like), she’d isolate me from everyone and make me be a girl. I used to complain about my mom yelling at me when I used to be lazy but I’ve matured past that, though I do tell a few of my friends when she does stuff like this. Also she says when in a disagreement or anything to be rational and not emotionally charged. When it’s about trans stuff she gets rather heated and doesn’t give any sources, plus all her ‘facts’ are obvious fear mongering stuff she’s found. I did find a small article about lgbt leading to cannibalism made in 2019 but idk sorry this is all over",nada_rat,2020-03-05 16:34:18,2,520,3.62,46.15,48.46,15.03,24.76,13.46,92.31,63.08,23.08,16.92,9.23,0.96,0,6.35,0.38,6.15,3.85,9.81,13.65,7.5,12.69,2.88,24.42,4.23,1.15,1.15,0.58,2.12,5.38,2.31,3.08,0.19,1.15,0.38,15.19,1.54,1.15,6.54,3.46,17.88,4.04,3.85,0.96,4.23,1.73,5,1.15,0,1.15,0,0.58,0,0.19,0.19,0.19,7.12,2.31,1.73,1.92,1.15,0.38,6.15,15.19,1.15,9.81,1.15,3.46,5.19,0.38,0,0.38,0,0,0,0.96,0,0.38,0.19,0.19,0.38,17.12,3.85,3.27,0,0.19,0.19,0,0,0.58,7.12,1.92,0
fea374,Blocked off memories and abuse,"Hi ok I don’t know how to go about this but I’m only a teen and recently I’ve opened up memories that I am 80% sure I have repressed for years. I just want to know is it serious enough to tell anyone I know personally or should I see a counselor? Anyways, the memories that have resurfaced and feel so familiar would be a cousin of mine doing weird things to me such as licking my feet and sucking my toes (gross but I can’t word it any other way) and blowing onto my belly even after I would tell them to stop and when it was overly excessive considering I was probably 4-7 (I’m not sure but don’t you usually blow infants bellies?), another cousin of mine never said anything even though they were present during some of these instances. Those are the only memories I have recovered involving my cousin and when these memories had came back, I had broken down into tears and told myself to try and not remember anything else because I don’t want to believe in the possibility of my own cousins going that far. There was another time where a boy french kissed me while we were playing hide and seek and I begged him to stop, I believe I was 9-11 at the time and I remember blaming myself for making him upset that I didn’t accept his kiss. One other memory of mine was when a boy close to my age came to my house because his mom was friends with my mom. It was late and our moms left, however, my aunt who is an elder was sleep in another part of the house so we weren’t left totally unsupervised. It was me, the boy, and his sister. The boy had started mentioning sex which I didn’t know about at the time and I believe he said something suggestive toward me that night was well but I had a gut feeling knowing it was wrong. To be honest the instances with my cousin scare me so much because I had told on him to his older brother but I don’t remember much happening after that, the unfortunate thing is I feel like I still have badly repressed memories of more traumatizing things he has done. Even if people don’t consider these instances abuse, I just want some type of guidance on why whenever these memories come to mind I can’t help but cry. I’m very insecure and afraid of relationships, I also have a hard time trusting people and have thought about, not killing myself, but I’ve thought about a world where I don’t exist.. I HIGHLY doubt these are false memories and I do not believe this is stuff my brain just made up, there has to be some connection.

feaadf,Rape or justifying my actions?,"When I was a sophomore in high school (I’m a freshman in college now) I was considered the innocent girl who was a goodie goodie. I wanted to “prove myself” to my friends and the popular crowd. 

I had never done anything sexual or even talked to a guy or even had an emotional connection with anyone. A guy in the grade above me added me on Snapchat and things began. In a way I liked the way I felt when he boosted and told me the things I wanted to hear because it raised my self confidence and made me feel wanted in a way. After a few weeks of talking he convinced me to hangout with him.

I picked him up late at night and I parked my car in a neighborhood. He proceeded to take my first kiss away from me, take all my firsts from me. I was basically a child at the time (an innocent newly 16 yr old). I remember telling him multiple times aggressively to “stop or I’d scream rape and kick him out of my car”. I remember saying this many times hoping he’d lighten up. He didn’t. He proceeded to push my head down forcing me to throw up a little. I was in fear of getting raped so I allowed him to have anal sex with me instead because I wasn’t ready for him to take a part of me.

After this instance I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I hated how I let him do that to me. I cried for days. The messy part is, I then allowed him to contact me again and allowed him to convince me to have sex with him a week later(the condom broke &amp;amp; I had to take plan b). I didn’t want to, but in a way I though that it was needed to allow myself to think this was all “okay and normal”. 

He sent out our sex tape to half my school &amp;amp; soon everyone knew that the innocent little girl that I was, was now changed. I hated this even though I thought originally that having sex would change my reputation. I proceeded to allow him to come over and have sex with me on &amp;amp; off for a little over a year because every-time I was sad I thought getting his attention would help me.

My parents found out &amp;amp; grounded me &amp;amp; shunned me for almost 9 months. After almost three years I finally accepted in my heart &amp;amp; out loud that he raped me. I didn’t want any of this to be done to me, yet I allowed it to happen when I could of stopped it.

In a way, I’m scared that I’m being dramatic &amp;amp; I didn’t actually get raped. Saying I got raped is such a hard word to say &amp;amp; an even harder pill to swallow. I want to express this to my family but I’m scared to be “dramatic” and to make them feel bad for punishing me when they didn’t know the whole story. If anyone has advice or answers I think it would really help with my mental battle that I’m dealing with right now and give me clarification on my emotions.",SOTRBlueBirdsFly,2020-03-05 23:54:53,4,558,44.36,19.49,96.96,4.24,18.6,12.72,94.44,59.5,23.3,18.64,14.52,0.18,0,3.58,0.36,4.66,5.56,14.7,7.89,5.02,5.73,1.25,18.1,3.05,0.9,1.08,1.08,1.97,6.27,1.97,4.12,0.9,1.97,0.54,10.39,0.36,0.9,0.36,3.94,14.34,3.94,2.87,2.33,2.33,1.25,3.41,2.15,0,1.08,1.08,3.41,0.54,0.36,2.33,0.54,8.06,1.79,0.72,3.94,1.79,0.54,8.24,6.81,0.72,16.31,1.61,7.35,7.35,1.08,1.08,0.36,0,0,0,0.54,0,0.36,0.18,0,0,15.77,5.2,1.08,0,2.87,0.18,0,0.18,1.43,2.33,1.08,1.43
feaswi,I want to not want this.,"I'm not trying to encourage stalking or abuse. Nor do I think it's healthy for me to be stalked or abused. I want to hear from people who have experienced it though to tell me how it *is* bad and scary, so that I can etch it into my head. (I posted this in a separate forum, but would want to hear from as many people as possible so I understand the breadth of the situation.)

This isn't meant to be a negative dump or pathetic life story, but the reality is I have no one. I feel very lonely and very lost. My family is dysfunctional; my friends are flaky; and I can't get a boyfriend. So, I feel pretty invisible and useless. That's where the fantasies about stalkers and abusive partners emerge. I watch films like *Fear* (1996) with Reese Witherspoon and Mark Wahlberg or short films about stalkers and kidnapping so that I can fantasize about having someone think about me. Want me. Need me. Someone to shower me with attention, to tell me I can't hang out with my friends, to check my phone and obsess over my whereabouts so that way I can finally feel loved, desired, and lusted for. I think about all the celebrities like Shawn Mendes or Harry Styles who constantly have adoring fans and worshippers. I know if I keep going, it'll spill into more and more stuff, so I want to focus on the stalking and abuse. Why *is* it bad? Why *should* I not want it? I quite literally have no one. It'd be nice to be the center of attention in someone's life.

I tried getting my own place in August and he never left-the kids are here, blows all his money so there is none for them, blah blah so I was dumb for my self worth and said he needs to be here so all his money can go to where it needs to and not booze and whatever else. Then, it got bad-like threats of wanting his gun bad.  Sorry dear MIL and SIL I don’t care how much suicide runs in your family or how many times you say I don’t understand how this is happening now when I have for years brought up his drinking, reached out when things were really bad, told you all his bs behaviors, the holes EVERYWHERE! No money, refusal to work. Like no-I’m important too. 

Now, I’ve been through emotional, sexual including raping me while I was sleeping, very little physical, a whole bunch of mental abuse with this guy. All for the sake that he was better than I ever knew (childhood abuse survivor here). We had kids, it wasn’t as bad as my parents a because we weren’t screaming everyday.  I thought we were an average couple and I loved him-still do but much much differently. Until I found for the umoteenth time of cheating-we had a verbal agreement just be open and tell me what’s happening. Physical cheating wasn’t the boundary for me-lying is. And that happens ALL the time. 

Now that I have a leave date, he knows, my parents are coming in stages to move everything out to this house...in our home state so I will be 14 miles away from both our families-he knows it’s because of him not choosing to work and leaving us financially broken and I need to keep the kids in a stable environment and get a car and stuff again.-but not that I’m never coming back to him as a partner. I will compare t and love him from a far but I cannot see myself with him unless he magically changes and grows up and stops acting like a child where he can avoid everything, not have consequences, and be a selfish jerk. 

Well, for me, I’ve been off my mental health meds for half a year now, I’m in my last semester, I have to say goodbye to going straight into grad school (hopefully I can make my way back)  to my current in state school (also top choice) after all the work and sacrifice I did just to get to this point, he sleeps in MY bed because it’s way easier to say I’m staying up and studying and get an actual night of rest on the couch without worrying about him touching me. I have felt like the abuser at times because there have been a total of 6 times I have struck him or thrown things at him. So what does my brain do? Tell me I’m the fucked up one, I’m the one who is shitty, I made him do all this, I’m the one with the major mental health problems causing all this drama, and I’m just crazy. But you know what? I AM NOT CRAZY!  Going to therapy when I was able and had my own car last year was the best thing ever! Having access to meds so I could gauge what is normal and what is me al health has helped because I can recognize when I’m having symptoms while being off meds and can calibrate myself accordingly. 

So, back to my question, did anyone have to wait to leave? How long? Do you want to talk about it? Omg this felt good to say out loud! Was it awful for you too having everyday then there and you have to be the comfort and support? And, I’m going to be age selective here-if you are just a young adult or soon to be one and have no experience other than awful parents I will gladly accept your love and kind wishes as I wished I had that at your age!!  but, I honestly don’t think there is any advice you can give or experience. The only advice I get from 21 and below is leave him! Thanks hunny, I am, but my situation is bigger than I can just crash on someone’s couch and block him. I have a marriage to dissolve and become co-parent with, a lease to leave, kids, a cat, and two fish, I have school, the kids school, etc. 

I need advice/guidance/whatever from those who have had reached out to their support network, set up an escape plan, etc., but just are left waiting. That’s what is killing me slowly I think, waiting.",bi-speech,2020-03-06 11:09:34,0,843,17.7,42.93,79.11,14.34,22.18,11.39,94.07,61.45,19.57,14.23,8.78,0.83,1.42,2.85,0.36,5.34,4.63,12.34,12.69,7,9.37,2.25,21.35,3.91,2.14,2.61,1.07,2.49,5.81,2.49,3.32,0.36,1.54,0.12,11.15,0.83,0.59,0,2.97,11.74,2.02,1.66,1.54,1.66,2.14,3.68,1.54,0.12,0.83,0.36,2.25,0.47,0.83,0.36,0.24,7.35,2.25,1.42,1.78,1.3,1.19,4.74,14.95,1.9,15.78,2.85,6.64,6.88,1.54,0.59,0.95,0.71,0.12,0.24,0.95,0.47,0.24,0,0.12,0.24,15.3,3.44,4.98,0,0,0.95,0.83,1.19,0,2.85,0.71,0.36

fezwjl,I need honest advice..,"Ok so here's what happening ..

I have a boyfriend of almost 4 years and it all started out so good, he was sweet, kind and always new what to say. He would treat me so well and stick by me even through my severe mental health illnesses. (I have major depression, anxiety, PTSD, Drug Resistant Schizophrenia, insomnia). I thought I had found the perfect guy for me. I thought he loved me. But I am now second guessing our relationship and how he has treated me and taken advantage of me. 

He was doing drugs a lot while we were living together in our own place. First it started off with weed, then nangs and then more harder stuff (to me) like MDMA. He is always doing research on it and the best ways to get high. You'd think this would be a red flag but I always listened to him when he said he was curious and nothing would come of it. I was so wrong.. a few times he would get horribly drunk, smoke weed and then snort stuff.. it got so bad that I would wake up in the middle of the night hours after he said he'd come to bed.. I found him in the living room.. I thought he OD.. I'd call his name and shake him.. so many times I thought he killed himself.. but he wouldn't remember anything the next day.. it hurt so much to see someone I cared about do this to themselves.. I was broken. Then it kept happening. More and more.

But then if he wasnt doing drugs. He would be really stressed out and take everything out on me. I always the one to blame because I had so many issues. I guess he thought it was easier to make me feel terrible then to deal with his own problems..

Well.. we are on break now because things got too hard for me. There was so many times I wanted to OD on my sleeping meds or cut myself because it seems so much easier to handle it that way. I never succeeded but it was really hard. I moved back with my mom and dad and now I'm getting confused. He starts by saying things like ""we'll talk tomorrow"" it never gets brought up. ""I'll come early"" he's not here till the family bbq. ""I want do to cocaine"" ""just once, for one night"" it was always ""just for one night"" but then he'd tell me what I want to hear, ""I won't do it anymore"". I'm sure the signs are obvious but I don't know how I would get through this.. I'm so scared of being thrown off the edge.. but I feel like nothing will change.. and I'll just be broken more and more.. 

I just don't know how to go about this.. I don't have friends ever since I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia nobody will talk to me anymore and I'm so afraid that they'll never accept me because of all my mental health problems.

ff52fm,Advice Please,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

For background and context, my family is the definition of a shitshow.  A tangled mess of unhealthy and abusive relationships with each other. My parents are conservative Christian Asians, which means I'm raised under the stereotypical strict Asian parenting but worse. It's helicopter parenting to the point of abuse, both emotionally and physically. To add to this mess my parents are in a position where their marriage is failing. They're cheating on each other emotionally and have been for years, and I don't think they know I know. The only reason they haven't divorced is because a) they're ""Christian"", although as far as I'm concerned they are both hypocritical asses; b) I asked my mom to hold off divorcing until I got into college because I didn't want to deal with the messiness of this during my last year of high school AND I wanted to be 18; c) my mom has a whole slew of medical problems including several organ transplants and an autoimmune disorder, and my dad's insurance is the only reason she can have her meds.

October - November of my senior year in high school was the lowest point in my life where I genuinely wanted to kill myself. I preferred being at school than being at home. Going to a uni that's an hour away from home and requires living on campus the first year has helped me so much, and the only times I've felt depressed again is during breaks when I'm home.

And that's the problem. Thanksgiving was shit, Christmas was barely manageable, but this past Spring break was the worst. Add this to the fact that my dad originally made a threat that if I didn't get a 4.0 in all of my classes this semester he'll pull me out and force me to go to the community college in the neighboring town. I'm decently smart, but I'm not smart enough to 4 point all of my classes. He then changed his mind this week that he would pull me out as soon as this semester ended and force me to go to the community college. I was originally planning to do summer classes on campus, meaning that I would get to dorm over the summer. However, if he follows through, and there's a good chance he might, this means I'll be living at home. I genuinely believe that if I'm forced to live at home I'll be driven to actual suicide.

So, I guess I need advice on how to manage the possibility of living at home or what to do next. I've considered cutting them off and declaring myself independent, but there are several problems: a) they're paying for my tuition and my phone plan. I can't afford to live on my own, especially since I'm considering med school which will already put me into sufficient debt; b) I would have to deal with my numerous relatives asking questions and knowing my parents I'd probably be painted as a scapegoat; c) as with almost all abusive relationships it's not bad all the time. There are plenty of times I've actually gotten along well with my parents. Despite everything they've also done a lot for me. And with Asian culture, I'm expected to care for them when they're too old to work and care for themselves.

ff5k7n,Catch 22,"If you try to be resilient and not talk about your abuse, or you try to assert positive language, count your blessings and recognise good where there is good. 

For example

Both my parents were highly abusive to me as a child and into adolescence and early adulthood.
But, my dad was better, we got along when I was grown up and I've healed a lot of that resentment.
So when casually chatting to partners or friends I've tried to say he's a pretty good guy.
But then when something happens and you say to your partner or friends ""this isn't a friendly or safe space"".
They assume you're lying or don't understand why you've been vocally defending that person in order to show gratitude when the reality is that you've been placating something in him and yourself for years.

So if you don't speak out about times you have been a victim because you're trying to be strong, when it comes to needing help, people won't believe that you were ever a victim of something.

Likewise, if you do talk about your abuse and you're honest about everything then when you try to show someone you can be strong, or you want some opportunity or try to convince someone you are capable. They look at you like a lamb and deny you can do anything. While also telling you that you have to do something.

ff6vvy,"My long, drawn on and confusing situation has me in a strange state of mind. I don’t even know if I’m in the right whatsoever, and I don’t know where to start with myself.","I’m not gonna put down my whole sob story, but all of it starts with the verbal and emotional abuse I received from my stepmother in young childhood to early adolescence. A lot of conflict with her damaged how I handle relationships with others and I only just started to realize how it affects me day to day after being in my first long term relationship. Things my SM would say to me have what seems like permanently scarred my self image, she was a ticking time bomb and now I’m seeing compulsive hiding/lying habits from her “punishments” I would receive as a child. 

I recently ended a long term, long distance relationship with somebody who I thought was the love of my life. He was in the military, were both young, and we were madly in love. Everything was fun and games in the beginning, but things peaked about him that I know are red flags in hindsight, but I was always making excuses. It would start out with photos and posts on social media, “we don’t take enough pictures” “if you loved me we’d take more videos together” and the infamous “it’s like you don’t care,” then it became swapping passwords to social media accounts. He’d do things like stage an act or make up a story that would lead me to believe he’s cheating on me, or leaving me for another woman. Then he’d say it was “gassing me up” and he “wanted to know I still cared.” It was very confusing. Then he found out about a local boy I had a fling with the summer before while him and I were in a confusing “talking stage” that was extremely on and off. 

((Background: at this time, XBF was working 12 hour night shifts, sleeping while I was at school, hardly talking to me, frequently saying “we’re nothing”))

I’m beginning to believe a lot of his actions after we’re my fault because of it. He went on a several week long tirade to message this boy, get things out of him, “get the details” of what happened, make him feel like shit and brag about how much we’re in love. Even though I haven’t spoken to Local Boy in almost a year to that point. He would keep me up at night on the phone draining details of every boy I’ve kissed, held hands with, sent photos to, hung out with, EVERYTHING ! And would never believe that he was my first time, because when we met I was a “h**.” But I’m not sure if i should’ve just never been that way and maybe he wouldn’t have had anything to be upset about? He was deleting old photos of mine with male and female friends, old flings or relationships etc., he deleted all evidence of a very cherished friend of mine. The list goes on but I feel like every time it was justified?

My best friend of 5 years, I tried to hang out with her for a week and he wouldn’t let me stay away from my phone for an hour to hang out with her. He pulled the “gassing up” that week and when My friend stood up for me, he called her a b****, and eventually made me BELIEVE she had a vendetta for our relationship. I wasn’t allowed to be friends with her, “because she was a snake in the grass.” And when I hung out with her, I “acted like a c***.” I continued to try and be friends with her in private, keep my friendships and my relationships separate, and when conflict arose I was forced to choose sides. I tried to play middle man, keep the peace, but both of them are spitfires and “last word” types. I feel like it’s my fault and that playing middle man to the argument instead of choosing a side made a lot of things worse, and hiding the fact I still talked to her definitely made me into a liar.

Even down the road I couldn’t help but find myself lying and hiding things, including that friendship. Where I was going ? Who I was with ? Who was on shift at work ? Even when we were broken up and I tried to see other people, or even if I was just going to Walmart or not doing anything odd or wrong at all I was hiding it. That got me into a lot of shit with him because I began saying things I thought he wanted to hear so he wouldn’t leave me, instead of the truth. And I feel like an awful person, because like a deep rooted, ugly, rotten seed it flourished into me and became a part of me and sometimes I do it with no shame, no realization until afterwards and I don’t know why. 

When I was assaulted months ago and the police tried talking to my dad about details of the situation, (they couldn’t find me and at the time he was my guardian,) he got everyone in the household :[him, my friend and her parents, my friends cousin,] to surround me and berate me with questions jumping at any moment to accuse me of “switching the story.” They all accused me of trying to ruin a young mans life, and how I told XBF for attention because “I knew he’d blow up.” When that wasn’t the case at all. I still think about it a lot and it was one of the most traumatic moments of my life to sit there with everyone telling me the one awful truth was a sick lie, and I don’t even know how to handle it. I’ve begun doubting that it could even be considered assault. I lie awake and I’m almost to tears remembering everyone screaming at me all at once. The feeling of my childhood, this relationship, and this past household situation doesn’t go away. It’s manifested into something I can’t identify.",seaMadii,2020-03-07 19:40:37,0,1030,42.51,44.21,85.62,7.01,23.95,14.27,92.14,60.97,20.87,15.24,10,0.87,0.19,3.88,0.29,5.63,5.53,15.83,8.35,5.15,8.25,2.33,18.54,2.91,1.94,1.94,0.68,2.23,4.95,1.65,3.3,0.58,1.17,0.29,12.91,0.39,0.78,1.55,3.4,14.56,3.5,2.33,1.94,3.3,2.23,2.91,2.43,0.87,0.87,0.58,1.17,0.39,0.39,0,0,8.35,3.69,1.26,2.14,0.68,0.97,6.7,8.06,0.68,16.8,1.84,7.86,7.38,0.49,0.49,0.19,0.1,0,0,0.39,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,17.86,3.69,5.05,0.19,0,0.49,0.1,0,3.11,3.5,0.58,1.17

ffh1mf,My (F19) boyfriend (M19) knows about my s*xual ass*ult and on the 1 year anniversary of it wouldn’t respect me not wanting anything sexual. am I a bad person for not forgiving him?Am I wrong to leave him for this?,"so over a year ago I was very badly assaulted by a boy I was seeing at the time (I won’t go into detail but despite me asking him to stop and physically trying to stop him he forced me to do things I didn’t want to and left me with bruises and obviously traumatised) it took me a while to want to get involved with another boy and then I met my boyfriend (who I’ve now been with for 9 months)

I told my boyfriend from day 1 that I had been assaulted and haven’t been with anyone since then so I couldn’t promise sex straight away. 
He was always very understanding despite not knowing the details and then one day we were having sex and I had to stop because I just burst into tears because my body was so disgusted and overwhelmed. He was so kind to me about that and I felt I could trust him so I told him in detail what happened that day. He was disgusted and angry and said he wanted to hurt the boy who did that to me and told me he would never hurt me. 

Then November 2019 came around and the one year anniversary of the assault (calling it an anniversary sounds so weird I know but idk what else to call it sorry) and I told him I was feeling really shitty and 100% did not want to have sex this week, I needed to let myself be sad. He came to my house the day before the one year of it happening and I reminded him and told him I wasn’t really in the mood to be touched at all.

All day he kept touching me and in inappropriate places and when I asked him to stop he wouldn’t like for example he would have his hand on my bum and I would say I don’t want to be touched there and he would just move his hand to a different place on my bum. He kept doing this and kissing me and touching my boobs and putting his hands in my pants (which I asked him not to do all these things and he continued to) and tried to have sex with me later in the day and I obviously said no.

He left my house in the evening and I was feeling really hurt because it’s not a nice thing to do to your girlfriend anyway but especially considering the timing. When he got home he brought it up and apologised and said he could tell it was upsetting me so I asked why he kept doing it and he just said idk. Then he apologised but kept saying things like he hates himself and he doesn’t understand why he’s like this and he will never forgive himself as if he was trying to make me feel sorry for him?

This was back in November and it’s now March 2020 and I haven’t forgiven him and have a lot of internal anger and disgust towards him. Part of me wants to break up with him but he has apologised and hasn’t really done anything like it since. Do you think I’m in the wrong for not letting it go and forgiving him?

I wonder what is this pattern and what can be learned from it so I can prevent myself from being open to such girls who think only of themselves, have no empathy, are very unreliable and shun every possible way of mature communication pretending they don't understand what I'm saying or didn't receive my texts or got so very busy and caught up but never actually pay serious attention to me as an equal individual.

Every time I set my boundaries, they come up with sarcastic comments that just belittle me as a person or start to brag about how much they have done for me and care about me, but they skip the fact that what they say isn't synchronical with their behaviors.

ffn971,I was sexually abused when I was younger and I still suffer the black lash today.,"On mobile so sorry for formatting issues. 


When I was in my middle school years I was a relatively good kid. However I was discovering my sexuality and gender identity around that time. My stepfather and mom relationship was going okay with just a few arguments here and there. However in my 7th grade year my stepfather came into my room and touched me. I think he was trying make sure I didnt know about it. It makes me sick to my stomach even thinking about it. He touched me in the bottom half of my body not the upper half. He did this twice. I didnt tell my mom about this. 

It stopped after those two times and I thought I'd never have to go through that again. Nope I was wrong. Then in my 8th grade year he came into my room and would tap me away asking if I wanted a massage. Being a dumb middle school I didn't think much of it. He started to massage me and then he started to touch me sexually again. He did this multiple times. Only once did he listen when I refused one of his ""massages."" The straw that broke the camels back was when I felt is erection press against my ass. I finally told my mom and what happened next spiraled out of control. She confronted my stepfather they fought. He told her I was a liar and in the end. The fighting was so bad and the situation got so bad that my mom ended up not believing and assumed I was trying to destroy her marriage. In the end I told my mom it was a lie and apologized to my scummy stepfather. After that she never allowed me to sleep in shorts or even sleep in the same house as him unless she was home. At first I saw this as a betrayal because I knew she never believed me. But then it turned into a blessing because he never touched me again after that.


A few years after that my mom caught him cheating while we were in Honduras meeting his family. (He couldn't come with us because he wasnt a permanent resident and couldnt get a travel passport). My mom found a sweet guy in Mexico who was her old flame and honestly he would have been a better stepdad than my actual stepfather. He was kind and gentle never treated me wrong and said my clothing style is really cool. (I wore primarily boy clothes because I could never feel comfortable in girl clothes again after what my stepfather did to me). In the end my mom didnt stay with him because he wasnt allowed in the us and didn't want to move us to Mexico or even the Mexico-Texan border to live. After my stepfather was caught cheating again and trying to make my little sister meet the woman he cheated on my mom with, we went to stay a but with family in the north of florida. 


After a few days we went home. The two days later she asked me again if everything I said about my abuse is true. I said yes and she asked me why i lied and apologized to him. I told her I was scared and didn't want to hurt her because I loved my mom and my mom loved my stepfather. She apologized to me but we never took action. She still doesn't trust him alone with me and I still dont like being any where near him alone. And in the end my mom stayed with him. 


Now I feel the sting of what happened back then because my own brother told me that I wasnt the only one who suffered and that he suffered in pur mentally, sometimes physically abusive family. He then started saying that his issues were far worse than I could ever face. I cried and stayed in my room. Because his gf was also almost sexually assaulted once and he doesnt know about my sexual abuse and called me an idiot for not trusting him with my abuse story. I feel awful and depressed.


I have a lot more stories about my abusive family. Like how my mom beat me about me being genderfluid when I didn't come out yet to her. And how she made me sit through a church service and listen to why homosexuality is bad. Also the time my father came and harrassed me while on a low key date with my current Gf. I feel like I have so much to share and I'm not sure if it's even worth listening too.",theluker21,2020-03-08 18:54:56,2,798,16.28,38.65,88.06,2.51,15.65,13.28,95.11,60.9,23.06,19.42,12.66,0.88,0,5.76,0.13,3.63,4.89,11.4,7.39,7.77,9.4,3.38,17.67,5.26,2.88,1.88,1.25,1.13,7.14,2.26,4.89,0.13,2.38,1.38,16.29,3.76,0.5,4.14,5.51,11.78,2.13,2.38,1.5,1.75,1.5,3.63,2.76,0.25,0.88,1.5,2.76,1.25,0.38,0.88,0.13,7.39,2.76,1.13,2.01,0.63,1.13,10.03,5.89,0.75,16.92,2.38,6.27,9.02,0.75,0.63,1.38,0.13,0.25,0,1,0.38,0.25,0.38,0,0,8.65,6.39,0.25,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.25,1.13,0.5,0
ffngl7,I’m just not sure,"I feel like I should start out by saying that my parents love me very much, and I feel really guilty about thinking this, but I’m confused.
Growing up, I didn’t think the things my mother would do to me(burning me, throwing books at me, hitting me, or keeping food from me) when she was angry with me or when I cried were that bad. But in middle school, I remember learning about domestic abuse and my mum checked every box when it came to physical and emotional abuse.
I figured it was just some silly list and moved on, particularly when my parents stopped hitting me after ninth grade and I had figured out a way to dissociate so I wouldn’t feel sadness or anything else.
Now I’m a senior and I’ve stopped dissociating and taking my mother’s words seriously, but a few months ago, my father pushed me down against the stairs and starting choking me during an argument. He realized I was turning too pale and let go. We went to talk to my mum. After that, I started to remember that when I was younger—around 5—he used to choke me until I agreed to apologize to my mum after a disagreement. When I brought up all the times he hurt me in the past, my mum seemed genuinely shocked and they both promised to never do something like that again, but I’m starting to think that I might have been abused. I suppose logically, it shouldn’t really matter because it’s over now and I’m going to college in a few months, but my mum recent said that despite everything, she wouldn’t change the way they treated me because I needed to be pushed to be successful, and I’m trying to figure out if it’s unreasonable to be afraid of or worried about them.",Maternal-child,2020-03-08 19:09:37,3,314,16.84,8.56,99,1,28.55,18.47,94.59,61.78,23.25,17.83,14.97,0.32,0,1.59,0.96,5.41,3.5,14.33,9.55,7.32,10.19,1.91,20.38,5.1,2.55,1.91,0.32,2.23,7.32,1.91,5.41,1.27,1.59,0.96,8.28,3.18,0,2.87,1.27,18.15,5.1,1.27,2.23,4.14,2.23,5.41,2.23,0,0.64,1.59,1.59,0,0.96,0,0.32,5.1,1.27,0.64,1.91,0.64,0.96,7.96,8.28,0.64,18.15,3.18,5.73,9.24,2.23,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.69,3.18,5.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.46,0.64,0

ffper1,Was I Raped/Assaulted?,"Additionally, should I stop associating with this person?

In Spring of last year, I had a non-serious thing with a guy for 1-2 months, but broke it off. We stayed friends. 

Afterward, he constantly complained (and still does) that I don't have feelings for him. 

One night, a few months later, we were both pretty drunk. He asked if I wanted to have sex, and I said yes, but I know it wouldn't have happened had I been sober. I cried afterward and was upset about it. I thought nothing of it by the next day. He thought this meant we were dating, and got angry with me when I said it didn't. 

He randomly rubbed my back/legs one time months later. I retreated to his bathroom, but he managed to unlock the door from the outside (twice,) and started asking me what was wrong, eventually saying I falsely accused him of sexual assault, which I didn't. In fact, I didn't say anything. I wanted to be alone, but he followed me around his house until I went outside. About a week later, I apologized because he blamed me for flirting with him/leading him on, which, once again, I didn't. He did not accept my apology. This led me to stop speaking to him for ~2 months. During this time he spammed me over text asking me to talk to him. This is when I began reconsidering the previous event, and since then (November) it has been nagging at me. 

Eventually I began speaking with him again, and since then I've been even more frustrated with the situation. He continues to make me feel guilty for not having feelings for him, and every time we talk, I feel like I'm his psychologist. It is exhausting. He asks me for justification for my lack of attraction to him every time we hang out, which I don't think is right at all. 

He never directly apologized for his actions, but repeatedly said ""I'm sorry you feel like that happened."" 

I probably should stop speaking with him, but he'll just keep bothering me like before. Also, I feel guilty about cutting contact with him, for some reason. I don't know what to do.",Aw_Jeez_Rick_284,2020-03-08 21:44:27,1,378,23.17,46.83,91.14,1,14,15.61,96.56,60.85,25.66,20.11,11.38,1.32,0.26,7.14,0,5.56,2.38,15.08,9.26,4.76,5.82,3.17,20.9,4.23,2.12,1.85,1.85,1.85,6.08,1.06,5.03,0.79,2.12,1.06,15.61,0,0.79,0,7.67,14.02,4.23,2.12,1.85,1.59,1.85,3.44,3.97,0,2.12,1.85,1.59,0.26,0.26,0.79,0.26,6.08,2.38,0.26,2.12,0.26,1.32,9.79,8.47,1.32,19.05,1.85,4.5,13.23,1.06,0.53,0.79,0,0,0,0.26,0,0,0.26,0,0,21.43,6.61,7.41,0,0,0.53,0,0.53,0.53,3.17,1.59,1.06
ffpy2n,Am I being abused?,"I grew up with a weird family. My two brothers are autistic and one of them is lower on the spectrum but has severe anger issues. Me and my two brothers are all 18 (yes, triplets.)

Last year, he started freaking out and having a meltdown. He beat up my other sibling, punched holes in walls, and just punched everything he could get his hands on.  My dad was working late and wouldn’t be home till 3 am.

He’s threatened to kill me before, so I thought he was going to try and hurt me. He used to beat the shit out of me as a kid. I had 911 dialed so I hit call as soon as he jiggled my doorknob.

I had a panic attack over the phone. My mom was screaming the whole time but didn’t actually get up and try to stop it for what seemed like forever. She screamed at me to get off the phone and I hung up abruptly. The operator told me she would send someone over and I did NOT want that to happen. I don’t even know why I called 911 in the first place, I’m just stupid and I panicked. 

So my mom screamed at me some more after I told her I called 911 then acted all nice in front of the cops while me and my brother were crying. He said he was suicidal (he wasn’t, he later admitted he lied) so we went to the hospital. My mom screamed at me the whole way there about how I was crying for attention. Before we got into the hospital she told me that I’d better clean up my face or else. After we were able to go home, she took my phone but didn’t punish my brother at all. 

I defended myself for as long as I could before my parents forced me to admit I did something stupid so I could have my phone back. My dad screamed at me that I was tearing the family apart.

Not long after that, he started hitting me. Not full-on beatings, but a slap here and there. Before any of this went down he was screaming at me for something I can’t even remember, and I told him to stop spitting in my face. So he spit in my face on purpose. 

One time the same thing happened while he was screaming but I screamed back, he slapped me and dragged me to my room. My mom defended him, saying she would’ve done the same thing. 

Another time, we were arguing about something stupid in the car and he told me not to say another word. I asked if I could go home because I didn’t want to be there anymore and he screamed at me. He didn’t hit me back then.

Yet another time, I left my charger at my friends house so he was driving me to go get it and we argued over something. He hit my arm. I started crying so he gave me a lecture on how he’s not abusive and never will be and that he’ll show me what REAL abuse is.

He hasn’t hit me in over two months. I’ve heard stories on here about parents that realized they were abusive and changed their ways. I feel like that could be my parents.

TL;DR I feel like I’ve been constantly taken advantage of sexually and I’m not sure if it’s effecting my body adversely - I want to know if anyone else has had these types of experiences and what doctors they saw first to feel like they were taking their life back. 

To start I will say I don’t always feel like I’ve been a great person - usually when I do act out though I’m joking or I’m mindless or I’m literally at my wits end and finally to a point where I’m like “well fuck that person I don’t care anymore” 

As a child I was very extrovert-introvert. I usually would push myself out of my comfort zone (or remember pushing myself) whenever the people around me would show concern with how quite or closed off and timid I was as a kid. I was born in Cincinnati, my family moved to California, then Florida, then texas. I really never struggled to make friends however until we moved to a conservative white town in north Texas - it was here I felt like I could just never say anything right that jived with any family I came across there. Everyone wanted to know what was fucked up about my family it seemed, there was nothing we could do to not be outsiders it felt. 

Generally before this situation, I also never had trouble with the opposite sex. I always had an equal amount of big and girl friends and as a child had all the same childhood bfs that lost girls have when a boy in class has a crush on them. When I moved to texas, that was when I became really good at a sport. I also felt like it was the first place where I could just be friends with boys which was alarming to me because that wasn’t really a problem for me before. 

Upon landing in Texas I felt like I did well through the 4th grade. In the fifth grade my parents told us they were getting a divorce and I tried to tel my mom I felt super adhd but other than that I felt like I only acted out on those feelings and emotions rather than actually feeling upset. I started to struggle to talk to people and ask for help or let anyone in ago it my family life because I visited a counselor at school and told her about my family situation and the advice she gave me was to go home and consol my father. My father generally was very hard on everyone in my family so in the 5th grade that was very confusing advice to me. I remember trying to force myself to like boys that I thought were cute but then thinking that I was shallow for only liking them bc they were cute. 

I had my first boyfriend in the 5th grade and I like never talked to him except for on aim - I thought he was really funny though so during that time I think our after school convos definitely helped get my mind away from my changing family life and our changing financial state as well. 

Around middle school my parents told me I would need to ask them about dating moving forward because they are nervous and I was traveling the country to compete in my sport at this point so they wanted me to focus. I remember having my first actual crush in the 7th grade that felt justified because I rally didn’t like the guy at first and then grew to like him once we became friends. I thought that’s how it was supposed to happen but he had a crush on my friend at the time so I instead just supported that I think - or at least tried to force myself too. 

In the 7th or 8th grade the kid started flirting back, we snuggled at a football gMe and I helped his family remove the fluffy things from the band kid hats since they were band boosters. He asked me to go under the bleachers with him but I wasn’t allowed to date and I thought he was going to ask me to kiss him and I just did not feel ready for that (I was 12 or 13 and also still fighting off being timid and afraid of people). I was really hurt after when the boy wouldn’t treat me like that at school. I remember it making me feel like I was in a hole or like a really dark space whenever I was confused or wondering if I even remembered the situations in which we were alone together correctly. I was a really cold matured kid so in the end I just convinced myself that the kid was being mice because he was really warm natured. 

By the 8th grade the kid would definitely flirt with me. I was generally afraid of social situations that didn’t involve my teammates so I would sometimes lean on him during these points. I remember once night at a friends house I was super uncomfortable and out my hand on his leg - he later texted me that I gave him a boner which made me super uncomfortable because I had to look up what it was but I thought it was endearing also. He was staying at a boys house down the street and I almost asked if he wanted to meet in the middle to cuddle but then I didn’t want to get I’m either of us in trouble. 

Later that year he texted me before a party at my house that I needed to ask my parents if I could date. He said if I didn’t ask he was going to ask someone else out and that he was considering asking someone else out already though he didn’t tell me it was my best friend. I remember feeling so fucking panicked to hurt another girl and also panicked to not give him the eighth answer. My mom and I were cleaning heavily and making food but she said we could try to cal my dad right before the party so he didn’t have time to think into it and say no. We didn’t get the time to call him and my mom said she would take the fall for me but I didn’t want her to because my dad was intense. The guy never even asked me or let me tell him about this situation at the party either.

That night that boy asked my best friend out and they apparently kissed in my adolescent bedroom. I remember feeling so mortified and embarrassed and just awful. To make matters worse everyone at the party had gone into my bedroom and gone through my make up that my mom had gotten me because I had interest in make up at the time. They put it on a kid and ruined part of the palette my mom had gotten me for Christmas and let me open already. (Side note: there was also a large dildo in my bathroom that my teammate and I had found and stolen in my house - we thought it was flipping hilarious it was so huge - no one at the party ever called me out for this but internally I figured lol) I finished the night out by lashing out and playing rock band to get me through. 

After my friends thought I was legit crazy I think so I showed all of them the texts from the boy. They all decided to hate him as well. I eventually felt so bad for this and tried to flip all opinions on this guy and become friends with him again. 

He was really nasty to me and would get after me for a pair of bell bottoms that I wore but wore plaid and my first article of clothing from Abercrombie (the outlet lol), my plaid converses (my first pair of converses - on sale so plaid was my only option but I really liked them). One day I was memorizing a poem in class so I highlighted each line in different colors thinking I would memorize a line a day by remember the color that went with that line - he made fun of my for this, etc. I remember thinking how hard this was because he didn’t know it but whenever he made fun of my that hard it made me feel super fucking obese but I had no justified reason for why it would conclude to that so I couldn’t tell him how bad he was hurting me. I also started dabbling with throwing up and starving myself and cutting myself so this seemed logical to me but I couldn’t tell him that without also making him feel bad because I didn’t have these issues before he and his friend started sticking gum on a specific necklace I would wear sometimes to feel pretty at school. 

I convinced myself I was falling asleep I class so I started starving myself because I felt like the food I was eating was making me tired and my gum would fall out onto that specific necklace when I did even though it didn’t happen on any other necklace. I also started cutting myself so that I would think about that when I started to dose off at school. However I never remember it happening again after that and I’m pretty sure the gum did so that’s how I realized it was someone Else adding the gum in. 

I was also just really mean back I think. I remember feeling like I had no clue why I could not control my annoyed looks at him or why I could not just look him in the face. 

While he was dating my best friend he was actually also my first kiss. I cried while he was on the way over to my house because I felt so bad but was afraid he would get so mad at me if I canceled. After I was so upset at myself that I cried and told my mother that I was going to tell my best friend. She told me that since it was his relationship, he was the one who should have been responsible for letting his girlfriend know because I didn’t want to make two friends upset at once. I’m not sure if he ever did. 

I once got the flu for two weeks that year and he would text me things along the lines of how much he missed me at school and how much he was not afraid of my germs. I don’t really remember this time correctly because I actually think I was really sick looking back on it. I had to go to the doctor a few times before I was allowed to stet living again basically.

Later in that year I looked up in the middle of algebra class and watched him finger a girl through her pants in the middle of class in the 8th grade. I thought he was looking at my whole he did it but I’m blind so I am pretty sure I just went to the bathroom and cried and convinced myself I was seeing things until my best friend in the class brought it up later. 

At the end of that semester he left a note on my binder in a pink envelope that I threw away because I was afraid of what was in it. Later that year, he also left a super sweet note in my yearbook that another girl in my class made me feel super guilty that I wasn’t fawning over it so I tried to love him again. This time he told me we had four years together at high school to date if we wanted to however I don’t know about this because he’s sense made me feel like I don’t remember anything correctly about our situation. 

We showed up at high school at the same time once to which I said it was weird and he told me he thought it was fate. I spend the summer in between 8tb grade and high school trying to convince myself there was nothing wrong with me other than my looks and then at the end of the summer realized how fucked up it was thag I had to do that in the first place and tried to just block him out. One of my favorite athletes shared the same name as him and I eventually threw away my signed post card from him because I thought it was strange that my athletic idol and he had the same name and that I would not even sporadically have the consider the kid if I got rid of my hero’s signature as well. 

High school was rough on a boy front. I really jus stopped caring, my first homecoming date cancelled on my when I told Him I wasn’t going to give him a blow job. I found a new one then proceeded to in ditch him for me neighbor that was also giving me the run around. My first date was a boy who invited me to the movies then also cancelled on me when I told him I wasn’t going to give him a blow job. I was trying to wait to try anything sexual until my period started since my family had no moral or religious convictions relation to celibacy. I really just wanted to make sure my boys was working, I also hated my home town for obvious reasons so I never wanted to get attached to anyone sexually so I could leave. I was working REALLY hard to try to be mice, be academic, and practicing for 30-35 hours outside of school I’m a sport and it felt like really unfair to me to be bullied so hard when I generally friend to make everyone feel welcomed regardless. 

That being said - I have grown to be a very angry adult [internally mostly]and I don’t want to live the rest of my life upset and mad because I know it will become external so I’m working through the next years trying to take back my physical and emotional health back and I really actually want to because I’m tired of feeling horrible about myself and also would like to actually form a healthy long term relationship with someone that I can share my life with now that I feel like I actually have done a lot of work on myself and am a good person. (This took a long time) 

To preface this - growing up I was an elite spring board and platform diving from the age of seven. I was probably a pretty bossy girl but I remember every time when someone called me out for being bossy I felt really horrible so I think I really tried to get rid of that habit by around age 10 or so. I generally always felt like I had issues these people around me would allude to but not confront me about out of fear of making me upset so I’ve spent a lot of my life trying to predict the ways in which I will make others upset before I do. This had lead to be not paying attention to a lot of my own needs I think. I’m not sure I just don’t want to feel sad or upset anymore. The way sexuality happened for me was weird because I didn’t have a period until I was 15 then not again until I was 16 then not consistently until I was 17.

The first time I ever gave a guy a blow job was a kid who was 17 when I was 15 and he knew one of my girl best friends that was on my diving team. He would come to my class everyday and try to sell me chocolate for his prom ticket fundraiser and ask me about it my friend. I invited him over to my house one night honestly thinking “wow I’m really far behind all of my friends sexually, I guess I’ll just invite a guy over and make out with him” I think I ended up giving him a blow job. I don’t remember because I was taking melatonin to sleep at the time but it was the reason I stopped taking melatonin. The reason I’m pretty sure I gave him a blow job was that he texted me that the next day. It freaked me out which is why I stopped taking melatonin. 

My first time happened on my couch when I had only had two mensutral cycles over two years. I woke up while spooning with a guy from a jarring dream and he was inside of me. This is when I gave up on myself sexually. I really haven’t valued anything about myself or my body since. My period started happening after this consistently because he was having sexual with me. I tried to break up with him three weeks into it but he told me he loved me. He would also get upset at me for wearing leggings as pants and told me when we died and went to heaven we would be brothers and sisters and we couldn’t have sex anymore at that point because we had to act like brothers and sisters. He would also tell me how he was friend with my English teacher and that his grandparents had a Hawaiian vacation saved up for a honeymoon for whomever he marries. Anytime I tried to break up with him he would go on Facebook and make a long post about how amazing I was and how much he loved me. 

He once showed me the twitter of a girl who was really rude to me in middle school and asked me about her. I said she was a bitch in middle school but that she had probably grown up or something along those lines because she was friends with one of my mutual guy friends. He ended up marrying her. 

On Valentine’s Day I was afraid he’d make me do anal and I was about to tell the kid from middle school everything about our relationship anyways because i was scared and had re read the middle school yearbook note he left me which said I could tell him if I needed help with boys. I figured it probably did not still stand from middle school anymore but I would try anyways and we had started flirting in my eyes. So I just straight up broke up with my boyfriend on Valentine’s Day. 

I continued to get closer to the middle school boy again and we ended up dating and going to prom together. It was obviously a way better experience than middle school obviously because he had grown up and I still remembered the good things I liked about him in middle school more than the scary stuff (expect for the situation that happened out my house - I still sometimes cry about that but I’ve generally disconnected him from the hurt and it just makes me sad to think about how much it changed my perspective on life and love still rather). So, I did indeed let myself fall in love too quickly this time rather but I thought he was too.

For my 18th birthday he wrote me a song and he would quote Beatles lyrics when we had sex sometimes so idk... I figured he also loved me. The song he wrote me was about how I brought love to the situation and how I was his everything so I decided to tell him I did actually love him after he sang that to me because I finally felt bad that I he never said it before.

When I to him he told me we didn’t have time to love each other anymore since I was leaving for college in a few months and I cried myself home from his house, he went on a trip and then came back and told me he did also love me but I while he was gone I trained myself to tell myself that I was never going to say it agin so all I could say was thank you and then I just told myself he knew so i didn’t need to ever say it again. 

When I left for college I frantically cried and mailed him letters that I was going to keep that I had written after every date we had been on pretty much because I thought I was going to forget everything and I had been looking forward to dating him since middle school. So I would try to recount everything and how much I loved him and then date them and then I sent them to him because I felt like I was always negative around him so I wanted him to know I was trying to go home and recount all the positive things. 

I ended up sending them because I was going to miss him and I also was afraid he was going to become depressed because he wasn’t going to college and everyone else was. So I wanted him to know he was okay and that at least someone thought the world of him if he didn’t think wel of himself for not taking a traditional path like the rest of us. 

I went to college and my period stopped. I told him after four days and he told me his brother had had similar experiences with girls and that it was never real. I got scared because I was now also considering his brothers life. So I googled all of the ways to jump start a period and did this things for the next few days until my period started (papaya, caffeine, cohosh, etc.) 

A few weeks after this I had a physical and was put on HUGE iron pills, vitamin D, a myriad of other vitamins, and birth control. This all made me super paranoid about what was actually happening to my body because i felt like I had no clue at this point. I decided to just power through this and delete all of my social media and focus my life into straightening my life out at this point instead.

I ended up having a great year academically and even met a guy that I actually ended up really liking at school. I still transferred to be closer to home and at a cheaper school at the end of the year. 

After about a year of being broken up I would still see my ex and sometimes even cheat on my boyfriend with him. We were once planning to hangout and I was about to start my period b UT had also decided I would finally tell my ex no and move on. This time he didn’t let me really say no anymore and so I had to physically get out of his car while I was giving him a blow job because I felt like I was gonna throw up on him. In my head I was telling myself it was because he was not letting me be consensual anymore and getting really mad at him but in reality I went home later that night and realized I had started my period in his car. I was so embarrassed and also have had a history of throwing up on my periods so I told myself it was that rather. 

When I confronted him about the situation and somethings he had said to me to try to get me to hook up again he told me I wasn’t remembering the situation. I did feel pretty sober but hit my head a lot growing up and was high so I’ve always assumed he was right and responded to this situation by lashing out and cutting him out because I honestly felt like I was ruining both of our lives. I was like seriously depressed and also scared of him and also wanting to jump back into another relationship so that he would just have to respect that. 

He told me he wanted to hook up with other people and that I should want to as well. I finally go the the fuck it point and hooked up with his friend that he was always wary about. That friend ended up taking pictures of my ass the best morning while I was getting dressed and sent them to people I went to school with. I was mortified and everyone consoled me by telling me I looked really good in the picture. 

After all of this I jumped into a relationship. The relationship was both so bad both ways that no feel like I will never ever be able to date again. 

I also get chronicle migraines and stomach pains and my periods have gone back to me throwing up and nearly passing out with shard shooting pain down the insides and out raises of my legs from my thighs to my knees. 

I don’t want to have to take depression medication and I want to be able To feel like I can be truthful in a relationship and also take care of someone.

Does anyone know any advice for how to approach doctors in these situations? I am aiming to see general wellness doctors over therapists first because I honestly think part of me feeling so awful is something medically that might be wrong. Thanks you in advance for any advice or encouragement.

I don’t want to lash out at my family and want to be able to be honest with my friends about my relationships and not have people constantly point out to my that I could be treated better or find a better partner in a relationship. I don’t trust myself to get to know someone or treat someone right or be able to be sympathetic/empathetic to their feelings at all anymore and I’m afraid I’ll just be dishonest in relationships forever as to not be a burden and appear as though I can just take care of myself in every possible way. So really - any advice is helpful.",treehomelove,2020-03-09 08:53:58,2,4402,22.84,28.65,92.56,33.21,30.36,13.45,94.57,62.65,22.56,17.22,12.29,0.66,0.05,3.73,0.5,5.34,4.23,14.29,8.81,7.45,9.15,1.91,20.08,4.29,2.45,1.39,1.11,1.2,5.45,2.93,2.5,0.91,0.48,0.5,12.15,0.75,1.16,0.66,4.2,14.83,3.41,2.39,2.07,2.66,1.61,4.09,2.5,0.64,0.43,1.32,2.36,0.59,0.93,0.43,0.23,8.36,3.41,1.64,2.2,1.29,0.43,10.34,6.2,0.91,15.67,1.91,7,7.04,1.75,1.07,0.68,0.16,0.14,0.02,0.68,0.2,0.2,0.05,0.14,0.07,6.45,3.29,0.55,0.02,0.02,0.05,0,0.36,0.09,1.64,0.36,0.07

ffxmni,Advice would be appreciated.,"Long post incoming. If there is a more appropriate sub to post this to, please tell me. 

This happened ten years ago and it still plagues me to this day. I was part of gymnastics club as a young teen, started at 13/14. I also joined a after school trampoline club. My trampoline coach was 24. He turned up at my gymnastics club to get his coaching qualifications and would help me stretch etc. I had a massive crush on him. 

Shortly after I turned 16, age of consent in my country, we started texting casually. I had his number because he would give me a lift to clubs etc. He would say he was out drinking and if I was old enough, he’d invite me. He bought me a Christmas present. We’d Skype. The conversations turned sexual. Now I had just had a messy breakup with a guy my age and I said straight out to my coach I couldn’t be messed around again and he promised he wouldn’t. So he picked me up after school, took me to his house and we slept together. He dropped me off at home and within an hour texted me that he couldn’t do this, ie be with me because he was my coach. He told me how big a mistake it was etc. And we slept together on and off for about a year.

I’ll be the first to admit I went a bit mad. I wanted to be with him, I was devastated that he messed me around although the promised. He would essentially bootycall me and, as a desperately pathetic 16 year old, I would sit around all dolled up on the off chance he’d phone. I would sit outside his house for the chance to see him or talk to him. Believe me, I know how pathetic and sad that all is. He’d call me crazy and insane, sleep with me, and we’d start again. I have no excuses for my madness. 

I had to quit the trampoline club because he would completely ignore me at sessions, give me no training, and generally act like I didn’t exist. 

I’d like to say this: it was consensual.

I have abandonment and commitment issues, an eating disorder and a myriad of other issues because of this. I’d never been so fucked over by a guy. 

I’ve tried therapy, but the therapist said because he was so young himself it must’ve been difficult when I was just pretty and jumping around in front of him. I’ve struggled to reconcile this with myself. 

Recently, I was thinking about a girl in my year who had also been at the trampoline club and around the age of 16 abruptly left. There is another girl in my year that had him as a friend on Facebook. I don’t know if it would be better to know for sure I was the only one, or better to know I wasn’t? I’ve struggled with the thought of reaching out to them, for fear of ridicule or him finding out. Would it offer me closure, or open a new wound? I genuinely don’t know. 

Any and all advice on how to process this, tips on closure, life advice welcome. Please. I need to close this chapter.",gymnasticthrowback,2020-03-09 09:49:43,2,554,29.87,42.83,63.72,10,13.19,15.16,92.96,61.91,21.84,17.87,11.19,0.9,0,5.6,0.18,3.97,5.42,14.8,11.37,5.42,8.12,1.81,19.86,4.33,2.17,0.9,1.62,1.62,5.05,1.81,3.07,0.72,0.54,0.9,12.64,0,0.54,0.36,5.96,12.09,2.71,1.62,3.43,2.17,1.81,2.17,1.08,0.18,0.9,0,1.99,0.54,0.72,0.36,0.36,8.84,4.15,0.9,3.43,0.72,0.18,8.48,7.22,0.18,16.06,0.9,8.84,5.96,0.72,2.53,0.54,0.18,0.18,0.18,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,0,15.52,7.22,4.15,0.18,0,0.36,0,0,0,3.43,0,0.18
ffxro6,(f) I had sex with my brother,"A few months ago I got really drunk and had actual full blown sex with my brother. I don't drink much and was already emotional. I was crying and yelling at my whole family because of how we were living at the time. My mom is a single parent to 3 boys and myself. She doesn't have a lot of money and is constantly struggling and has her own demons. Well I yelled at her too and she spent the night at our aunt's house that night. I remember my cousin trying to cheer me up, and then my brother. I was crying and he held me. Next thing I know we are dry humping. I feel wrong about it and tell him and he says ""its just a taboo"" and then we fuck. I was so drunk. I also feel like my other brothers and cousin know but they havent said anything. I just don't know how they wouldn't know.  I would have never let that happen if I wasn't drunk. But I wasn't so drunk that I didn't know it was happening.  I feel so guilty and disgusted but for some reason I felt sad for him. I had this overwhelming feeling that he learned this from somewhere. I want to talk to him about him and ask him what happened to him but I also just want to forget about it and act like it never happened. I always had a feeling he had a crush on me or something so I just don't wanna make it worse. I am the closest with him and don't want it to be weird.

fg7r55,My abusive ex won’t leave me the hell alone,"I left my emotionally, physically, and mentally abusive ex about a month ago. Haven’t talked to him since the last time he laid his hands on me. I blocked him from everything imaginable, including his family, friends, and people I met through him. Everything was going great, I started going to therapy and started to feel better about myself and extremely proud of myself for leaving. But then on Friday I got NUMEROUS emails from him (his email was blocked, it went to my junk folder to empty it and apparently that’s where blocked emails go). Apparently some of his friends saw me at a bar and told him so he lost his shit and had a tantrum like a 4 year old does when they don’t get their way. He said come pretty cruel things in the emails, but never threatened me. The next day comes around and he’s asking people that I know if my friends know my location.

fgakgv,I had one of best friends betray my trust.,"This is my first reddit post ever, and this is something I've told very few people.   It's difficult to talk about, but I feel like I should say it.  First, a little context.  I was sexually assaulted as a child for around a year by a member of my family.  Some of it is burned into my memory, and some of it is a blank. But it resulted in me gaining a lot of weight and I had PTSD from it, making me feel frightened and somewhat disgusted by anything sex related.

One day I met this guy in an online game, and we became friends pretty easily.  He understood a lot of my feelings without me even needing to say it.  He stood up for me if someone started harassing me, and he was patient and kind when I would get anxious.  We were good friends for months, and he helped me through a lot.  

As the months went by, I started to have feelings for him.  I liked him.  I liked the way he made me feel.  I felt like he genuinely cared for me.  I decided to tell him how I felt after a lot of silent arguments with myself.  Then he disappeared.

I would text him every day trying to get him to answer me, apologizing all the time for saying anything to him about my feelings and it would bring me to tears just wishing that things could go back to the way they were. 

Then he finally text me back.  It went something like this: 

Him: hey, sorry for going poof

Me: oh I'm so glad you're back.  Why did you disappear?  I'm sorry about making things awkward.  Just forget I said anything please

Him: I like you

Me: what? You do? 

Him: yep.  I look at your picture all the time. 

Me: why did you leave? 

Him: was dealing with stuff at work and wasn't sure how you'd react to me telling you that I masturbate to your picture every night. 

Me: .... don't say that

Him: thanks for the boner

And he sends me a picture of him holding his dick.  I immediately go numb and my mind just sort of freezes.  I dropped my phone and I can almost feel my brain short-circuit.  I run to the bathroom and throw up.

I couldn't text him after that.  Every time I opened our texts, I would have anxiety attacks.  I felt so dirty and violated that someone so close to me that KNEW my history would do that.  It still makes me feel that way now, almost 3 years later.

I confronted him about it in a random burst of confidence about 6 months ago, only to find out that he doesn't even remember it.   And hardly remembers me, apart from my name sounding vaguely familiar.  It crushed me and I felt robbed of closure on the whole matter.

Sorry for the long post, it's just been on my mind a lot today.",Popped_Balloon,2020-03-10 01:23:03,2,510,23.68,52.35,70.98,19.89,12.44,13.53,95.49,60.78,27.65,20.2,12.75,0.59,1.76,4.9,0.2,7.45,4.31,13.14,7.25,6.67,5.88,0.98,18.24,3.33,1.76,1.18,1.18,2.94,6.27,2.94,3.33,0.78,1.18,0.98,13.33,0.2,0.78,0,5.1,15.88,4.71,1.96,2.16,4.71,1.57,1.18,5.69,1.18,1.57,2.94,1.37,0.59,0,0.98,0.2,5.69,1.96,1.37,1.76,1.18,0.39,6.67,9.02,0.78,12.75,1.96,4.71,6.27,0.2,0.78,0.39,0,0,0,0.98,0.2,0.39,0.2,0.2,0,16.08,7.84,3.14,1.96,0,0.78,0,0.2,0,2.16,0,0

fggqmm,After all this time,"Hello whoever's reading this, there's so much I've not been able to tell anyone for the past 4 years.
I don't feel comfortable telling my current bf certain things about my life before I met him.
(So to start, I'll go back to when it all started)

Five years ago, I met this guy (will refer to as Nick)
My friend at the time asked to come over and if he could bring his friend. I used to be really outgoing and accepting to everyone, so I said sure! 

We all had fun playing video games and drinking, but after my best friend fell asleep, me and Nick were drunk kissing and ended up falling asleep to a movie.
The next day I woke up next to him and we were all getting ready to hangout at Nick's house.

We end up at his house and hangout for a few hours, when Nick asks if me and my best friend want to stay longer to play more fallout and eat dinner. My best friend had to go home, but I lived 2 hours away and had no car, and Nick was handsome and extremely sweet so I agreed.

We clicked really fast together, feeling like we'd known each other for years (this was my first time being with a boy so I was really naive)
He asked me to be his girlfriend and I happily agreed.
We ended up staying at my house and he started living with me almost instantly. We were pretty happy so it seemed, we did everything together.

But after a couple months, he started showing his true colors that I never really saw as signs to gtfo.

In that relationship, he told me that I was
1. Not allowed to talk to other guys
2. Not allowed to wear ""revealing"" clothing (short skirts, tank tops, crop tops, shorts, etc.)
3. Not allowed to work where ""attractive"" guys work
4. Not allowed to do certain things he would do himself
5. Not allowed to talk or hangout with my old close friends
In addition, if he wanted sex, we had to have it or he would get mad and threaten to leave

He would go through my phone and all of my social media apps and check to see who I was following or talking to, he would question me and gaslight me.
Being young and very stupid, I didnt see any of this as signs (and I thought I was in love )

When some of my friends had met him, they all told me about the same thing ""something's not right"" or ""he doesnt seem that nice"" and I always felt confused.

Everytime he would argue with me or scream at me over whatever he was angry at, we would apologize and he would go back to being super sweet again. Though they always ended with him concluding that it was always my fault.i didnt think much of his temper for a while.

There were some times when I would be really emotionally hurt from him where I didnt want to talk to him(but I didnt let him know that, I would just get quiet and sad) he would want to have s*x with me when I didnt want to and I felt like I had to so I wouldnt lose him. I never thought about it as him forcing himself on me because I loved him and I thought it would make everything worse.

I thought ""this is love"" when hed come back to me happy and sweet and telling me how much he cared about me.

As the first year went by, he ended it with me because of my extreme anxiety and my depression (as it turns out his actions slightly drove me crazy past my mental illnesses)

My best friends at the time let me stay with them at their apartment for a couple weeks so I could get out of the mess Nick made. Even a few of his friends were on my side, finally seeing who he was. But I still felt like everything was my fault and missed him, being in denial of his personality.

After a couple weeks, me and Nick ended up back together and stayed at my dad's (my dad and stepmother are not the nicest people). We stayed in the guest house on his property while I worked at the local grocery shop.

We felt happier there than the city, but that didnt last long. The arguments got worse and worse. When we would argue it escalated to him clenching his fists about to punch the wall saying ""if you werent a girl"" or him having threatened my life

Nick's friends would sometimes come up to the property to have a get together, with drinks and games. Sometimes Nick would go out with them claiming they all went to a friends house we all knew so I didnt think I had anything to worry about.

The more and more he started leaving with his friends, the more worried I was. Though he kept reassuring and claiming he wasn't doing anything wrong, I found out much later such was not the case (I'll come back to that)

Remember how I said my dad and stepmother were not nice people? 
When my birthday finally came, me, Nick and my stepmother were supposed to meet my dad in another city to have a breakfast.
Nick had his license and stepmom offered him to drive.
He was starting to back up when stepmom was backseat driving and she started being condescending.
I was in the backseat scared, knowing he would flip out at this.
Nick gets mad and leaves the car in park halfway backed up the driveway.
I was crying running up to him to try and calm him down as he slammed the guest house door.
Nick punching things in the house, screams how much he wants to murder stepmom and how.
Stepmom overhears and tells my dad about how she wants us to leave.

A week later, we leave back to friends apartment.
Seemed fine at first as we all got along pretty well. Nick ended up going out with friends alot and it worried me more when his friend had let me know he was avoiding me. Nick wasn't communicating with me and treated me like trash.

One day he finally comes back, we have a big argument. Nick locks himself in room and wont come out until I move out. Basically I had do move out within that hour or he would call the cops on me.

I was a sobbing wreck and contacted a couple of my old coworker friends and they picked me right up to get out out of that situation. 

But that's not where the problems end

I found out 2 days later I was pregnant from Nick.

I was in major shock and terrified, as I wasn't sure how he would take it and the fact that he told everyone in the small town how horrible of a person I was.

When I finally got ahold of him, he didnt believe I was pregnant and made me take a test in front of him as proof

A few days I move to my bio moms house. (I never told her I've been preg)
Nick messages me that I need to force a miscarriage or go get an abortion.
I was 2 weeks preg when I found out and was set to have an abortion 2 weeks later.

After everything was over and done, my depression was off the charts and I was having suicidal thoughts.
I begged my mom to take me to an institute so I wouldnt do anything stupid.

So after that 2 year off/on relationship, I've been left extremely scarred, but much stronger that I was before.

Disclaimer: I was very much in love. Cheating or hurting him never crossed my mind because he made me ""happy"" and I thought he felt the same. I never thought his abuse was abuse, I saw it as normal, even though he is the epitome of fucked up
Some of the things he did in between

•threatened to harm me, my parents and himself
•pretend to be my best friend and claimed the world of me, but was cheating behind my back
•had his close friends play along that everything was ""my fault"" 
•selling my belongings for marijuana
•made me quit jobs because guys he thought were ""good looking"" to me(???) were working there
•when we were in public and he would get mad at me for literally nothing, he would leave me alone in a city I didnt know of by myself
•tried to coax me to rob a store with him

I apologize this is really long, but I still am scared to tell people I know and it feels good to get out of my system.

I support all who have been abused and will listen with no judgement

fggrva,"My mom locked all of our bedroom doors and told us to sleep on the floor. Happened almost a year ago, think it's time I tell someone about it.","I'm 12. Idk if this classifies as abuse, but it was almost a year ago, and I felt like talkin about it cuz even I still don't know what to label it.

Longstory short, my mom locked all of our (my brother's and dad's, and mine, and the living room) bedrooms because she values her own dignity over ours.

We're a family of 6. It's my mom - E, my dad - J (46), my older brother - T (16), me (12), my younger brother - R (2), and my littlest brother - A (4 months I think).

When this happened, A wasn't born yet.

We had a maid, since my parents both work, and someone had to take care of R, since he was still a year and a few months old when this happened. Her job was to clean the house, cook the meals, and take care of R. 

When we first got this maid, she seemed nice enough. She did her job, cleaned everything, and took care of R. But as the months went on, she got worse. She wouldn't clean anything for weeks at a time. She got a little more violent and harsh with R, but even that's hazy in my memory. Shed get angry and her and my mom would have an argument. I still am not sure who's in the wrong for this.

Now, the last week of her contract, when she was meant to leave, she locked herself in her room, and refused to come out, kept yelling through the door when we told her to come out. She didn't make us lunch. She didn't make us dinner. She didn't clean. She didn't do her job.

So, her room has an ironing board, and the iron. It was her last day with us, and we couldn't wait till she got the fuck out. It was nighttime when this happened. 

My dad, brothers, and me had gone out grocery shopping. I know most people hate it, but it's mostly fun for us, cuz we get to mess around with a ton of things, and tease R with tiny little packets that we sneak to the cashier to scan for him at the end.

As we were driving back home, we got a phone call. It was through the car speakers. It was the maid. She was calling to say that she's afraid of my mom, saying that my mom's gonna hit her, and saying she'll call the cops if she does.

We're an Egyptian family in Qatar. Both Egypt and Qatar hate each other with a burning passion. If the cops were called, I have no doubt they'd believe anything the maid would've said over us.

So, my dad tells her to calm down, moms not gonna do anything (the only people she hits are her family, and even then it's rare), and he hangs up.

We get back home to mom shouting and yelling and trying to open the maids bedroom door, asking for the ironing thingy (I can't remember what it's called) so she can iron her clothes for tomorrow.

My dad and brother immediately tell her to back off. They pull her off the door, and a shouting match ensues between my dad and mom for about a minute, then between my older brother and mom for 15. I had already said about 2 sentences to hair as soon as I had gotten through the door with R, ""What the fuck are you doing?"", and, ""Are you insane?"", all in Arabic. 

After that, I'd gone upstairs to use the bathroom, to change clothes, and then to put R to sleep. He was already tired, so it was an easy job.

I then go downstairs, where the tension is so thick I can practically taste the hatred in it. The TV is on, playing some irrelevant news program, and everyone's eyes are angrily drawn to it. My older brother and mom are trying their hardest not to glare at each other. My dad just looks exhausted. I stay out of things, because I'm a confused dumbfuck, and I'm a kid, I got no business with them, as far as I've been told.

I ask what happened, and that's the first mistake. Brother says nothing, mom starts bitching, and dad says to go do my homework. I'm no idiot, but I know when Ive fucked up. My brother and mom start arguing again based off of my mom's bitching, and that's when I open the computer and drown them out with greenday, because I have homework to be done, and I have no business in this situation.

After a few hours, things somehow escalate to my mom getting fed up with my brother, and going upstairs, locking all of our doors, taking the keys with her, and going to bed.

I go upstairs, and I'm angry. Of course I'm angry. My rooms locked. I have no problem sleeping on the couches downstairs, but I've been quite for a few hours now, I'm fed up. I tell my dad that moms locked all of our rooms, and he sighs, and says he'll take care of it. I try to kick down my door, because I'm stupid and angry like that.

So my dad goes upstairs, tries to coax the keys out of my mom, she keeps refusing, saying how her family should sleep on the floor if they think they can embarrass her like that in front of the maid. My dad starts explaining her mistake to her, frustrated but far from shouting. My brother already explained it a million times, but she always insists she's right. My mom again insists she's right.

Then my dad tells her he has work at 6, and he has to get up at 5. It's a little past midnight. He's a doctor. She throws at him the keys to his and my older brother's shared bedroom, and tells him to not let my older brother sleep in the room, but on the floor.

My dad refuses, takes the keys, and tells her to hand over the keys for the living room and my room. Mom says no. Dad insists, she says no.

Older brother tells dad to go sit down, take a breather, he'll deal with it.

My dad does that. Sits down on the busted couch in the hallway, and opens his phone, waiting for the shouting match between my Olde brother and mom to end, again.

Some time later finds us at 2 am, with my mom fed up with my older brother, so she throws the keys to all the rooms at him. At this point in time, I'm holding R's hand, and trying to sing him back to sleep with twinkle twinkle little star. Mom pushes me off of him, takes him into a hug, and tells me to go.

I take my keys, open my bedroom, switch on the AC, change my clothes, plug up my phone, brush my teeth, wash my face, go to bed with earphones in so loud it hurts because this has just been a mess and a nightmare.

A few minutes later, I'm about to doze off, when my dad opens my door, hugs me, and tells me he's sorry this happened. And even though I was almost out of it, I hug back and tell him it's alright. 

Because it is.

It's not his fault. I don't blame him. This isn't the first fight with my mom, I know how shit goes every once in a summer holiday. It's fine.

But even though this was almost a year ago, it's been nagging at me more and more nowadays, and I don't know why. Thought if I talked about it to a bunch of strangers on the internet, it would be better, and I guess I'm feeling calmer to have it all out.

fgnhe8,childhood abuse and current feelings,"A few things I remember from my childhood. I'm currently 36, living in Sweden. Grew up in the suburbs of Los Angeles.

My father sexually abused me from whichever age to when I was 13 and told him to stop. Lots to talk about there, but I've talked lots about this in therapy so skipping for now.

Mom washed out my brother's and my mouths out with bars of soap if we cussed or talked back to her. I remember being 8 or 9 and crying/choking as my tongue was slipping against the bar, soapy saliva streaming down my throat. I remember afterwards the soap being stuck to my teeth and me trying to get it off. Her later reasoning for doing this was that her dad had done this to her.

I used to wet my bed, as some kids do. I can actually remember the dreams before I peed- I would have to use the toilet, and I saw one, pulled my pants down, and sat on it and started to pee in relief. In the dream, me and the toilet would suddenly turn horizontal, and I knew I was dreaming then and would wake up to a wet bed. To have me stop, my parents hooked up an electric circuit to my underpants so that when i peed and the liquid connected the circuit, a sharp tone would sound near my ear, waking me up. It somehow caused a metallic taste in my mouth, and I still dream of that sound and taste.

Like many kids have experienced, my dad would lash my brother and I with a belt on our naked rumps when we did something he didn't like. My brother and I would cry and plead with him and say we were sorry, but he would always continue.

My dad would hit my brother much more than me, and would degrade him with names, and refuse to do father/son stuff like play ball with him.

My mother ended up doting more on my brother to make up for the imbalance my father created.

When I told authorities about the sexual abuse when I was 16, my father was taken out of the house. My mother's favoring my brother remained, and I felt even more isolated. 

Ended up attending university at least 6 hours away, and then furthered the distance by studying abroad in London. Later, moved to another continent and have been living here, working, for the last 5 years. I didn't go home for Christmas this past year. My mom and I have talked about the ""favoring"" thing, and she acknowledges it, but we don't know what to do about it. Her and I have spent lots of ""quality"" time together since my father left when I was 16 (20 years ago now). We ran a marathon together when I was 18, took a road trip together when I was 22, etc. But still, when she came to visit just a couple weeks ago, I got a nauseous, tight feeling in my stomach (a feeling I would have routinely as a child and throughout my life when something not okay was happening). I also felt unhinged, and powerless. Talking with her about anything regarding her behavior is terrible- she cries and makes me feel awful, or gets angry and cries and blames me. I stopped trying to effectively communicate with her years ago. Which is one of the reasons i think I live so far away. Obv I know there is unresolved issues. I just don't know where to start. 

Just wanted to share, and get my experience out of my heart and into the open.",snappeaexpress,2020-03-10 16:36:31,1,619,42.08,36.1,91.51,11.22,17.69,14.38,91.6,57.51,18.9,15.35,11.63,0.97,0,2.75,0,3.55,4.68,14.54,7.75,5.82,9.69,0.81,18.42,3.07,2.1,2.26,2.1,2.1,3.72,1.29,2.42,0,0.81,0.97,10.18,3.23,0,2.42,3.39,10.18,3.07,1.62,1.94,2.42,0.16,2.26,3.39,0.16,0.65,1.62,4.2,1.94,1.29,0.48,0.65,7.59,2.91,0.97,2.58,0.97,0.48,8.56,6.79,0.32,16.96,1.94,6.79,8.4,0.48,1.45,0.65,0.16,0.16,0,0.16,0,0,0.16,0,0,14.22,5.49,5.33,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.65,1.45,0.65,0.32

fgr3tk,Abuse (minor) from my parents left me with a fear of adult men.,"To clarify stuff first: the abuse I went through is very minor in comparison to what others have gone through and I have trouble coming to terms with it as abuse. I was emotionally neglected / abused by my mother and father for about 4 years of my pre-teen life. My parents would scream at me, call me names (to put it lightly i guess), and were almost always wasted. I have driven them home from the bar before a few times when I didn’t trust their driving. My worst memory is of my dad screaming at me through the door as I sobbed on the floor, simply because I called my mom when I was home alone and couldn’t get him on the phone. I don’t want to go into detail but it left me scarred, physically and emotionally.
   Anyways, as I said, my parents (my father in particular), left me with a fear of young adult - middle aged men. Old men don’t scare me but pretty much any man between that age range makes me extremely anxious.
   This sucks in particular because 5/6 of my teachers are males matching this age range. I have one female teacher and the rest are men.If they even look at me I feel like I can’t breathe and I want to run away before I do something to make them mad. I have no one I can talk to about this because my friends don’t care, I don’t trust my teachers enough to talk to about this, and my immediate family (not including my parents, they’re not really in my life anymore) thinks I can get over it myself. Don’t get me wrong, I love them to death, but I’m going through a harder time than my pride will allow me to admit.

fgwqj5,IDK What To do,I've posted about these issues before in the past and have continuously tried to fix my situation but nothing seems to be working. My parents are highly emotionally abusive and refuse to see it that way. on top of that i have gone to DCF twice and have had the cops come to my house. I've told my school my friends other adults in my life and all of them including my guidance councilors and even my schools principle have agreed what they are doing is highly abusive and not good whatsoever. The only thing is that DCF refuses  to do anything about it. They say they don't want to do anything about emotional abuse. My case worker even said to my face that what my parents are doing is horrible and that no child should deal with that but they don't like pulling emotional abuse victims because the systems full enough and even though she wishes she could pull me she most likely wont.

I have very bad anxiety and depression that my parents refuse to take into account saying they know what real depression and anxiety are and I don't have it even though I have taken multiple tests and seen a doctor about it which all said I had it and my mom even cried when she found out now I'm guessing that was a front.

I don't normally struggle with depression but I've noticed that I've become more depressed lately. I got some blood work and it was noted that I am low in Vitamin D.
I feel like I'm stressed about absolutely everything, my job, my relationship , money etc . 

My mood seems to change either daily or hourly . Sometimes it's consistent for a week. One minute I'm motivated getting stuff done , positive about life the next I'm having panicking attacks, crying at work , worrying about absolutely everything.
Ive had this cycle for years although I notice it much more now that I'm in a relationship and live with my partner. 
I'm struggling so much. When I'm not anxious and calm . The things I normally worry about don't bother me as much but when I'm upset everything feels like the end of the world. I can get so overwhelmed that I become suicidal .
I can't always get to therapy so I try and follow a lot of therapy, psychology , self help pages on Instagram and Facebook . I find them to be somewhat helpful but I feel like I'm getting waaaay too much information and I don't know what to do with it all. 
I try and have a healthy diet, take supplements and get exercise. My job consists of being outside all day ( traffic flagger ). I try so hard to not have any vices ; smoking too much weed, smoking cigarettes, drinking everyday, playing video games everyday, watching YouTube everyday . Sometimes it's so hard though and I wish I could just have 1 glass of wine or I'm stressed or smoke weed. I force myself not to when I'm overwhelmed though because I want to find healthier ways to get through things. I only smoke weed when I'm in a good mood , same with alcohol. I feel like I analyze everything so much to make sure it isn't toxic or unhealthy. I analyze the content I watch/listen , it gets to the point that even if I enjoy watching it, if part of me thinks there are bits that are ""toxic"" I stop watching even if it made me happy. I don't pursue friendships with many people because I can never find people who are ""healthy"" enough and thus I feel lonely. 
I wish I could just live. I wish I could just stop thinking. I can't handle this, I don't know what to do, I'm so scared and overwhelmed. I wish I could stop worrying if things were right or wrong , toxic or unhealthy . 

My boyfriend ( 27 ) has mentioned that this can be normal for my age (21) and that after age 25 I will begin to get better at emotional regulation . He has been incredibly supportive and I love him so much but I'm even getting to the point where I want to break up just so he doesn't have to deal with me and I can just hide away.

I really need help. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm so fucking sick of these cycles. It's like a never ending hell vs heaven . Please help me .

TL:DR: Feeling incredibly overwhelmed, stressed, anxious , sad. I haven't been depressed in awhile and have begun getting depressed. Tired of my emotions bouncing all over the place . I don't know what to do and just need support 😭😥",gaiashay,2020-03-11 15:50:28,2,651,10.24,4.29,93.21,1.8,14.47,17.97,94.32,56.22,20.74,14.44,13.82,0,0,0.46,0.15,6.3,2.76,10.45,11.21,7.99,9.06,2.92,21.2,5.38,2.46,1.69,0.77,3.69,9.37,2.92,5.84,3.23,0.77,2.3,4.61,0,0.31,0,0.61,17.67,4.3,1.54,3.07,3.84,2.76,4.76,2.61,0.77,0.15,1.69,4.61,0.15,3.23,0.15,1.38,8.76,1.84,1.38,2.92,2.46,0.77,1.84,17.05,0.77,10.6,0.46,3.69,6.3,1.54,1.54,0,0.15,0.31,0.15,0.61,0.31,0,0.31,0,0,17.51,6.61,3.84,0.31,0.15,0,0,0,0.61,4.76,0.92,0.31
fh6pc2,"If psychological abuse arises from the child's disobedience, is it the child's fault? Why or why not?","Hi, I'm kinda new to reddit. I'm sorry if this question is offensive. I couldn't find community guidelines, but I guessed it should be okay, since it is sincere. I sincerely want to find a healthy way to answer this question. And I need some thoughts out there. Heard it might help or smth.

I've had a really difficult relationship with my mom, and even though I'm currently 32 years old I find myself frequently experiencing distress over the things that have happened. We've been on speaking terms for the past 10 years now, and I've (basically) forgiven her. Now that I'm 'a rational adult' I understand that she had abusive parents herself, combined with a severe brain injury at adolescence. She honestly cares about me, and did everything in her capacity.

I'm in training as a social worker (I know, fixer-type), and while doing research on child abuse I stumbled upon this question. I believe my mom responded the way she did because she felt powerless against my willfulness. I think she felt like she lost her ability to be a good parent, and I feel really sorry for her.

This question really caught me off guard. I know you can't put responsibilities on a child due to being in development and being dependent on the parent, so I know the answer. But the answer feels wrong. We were both people that wanted to be loved, and we've hurt each other a great deal.

So, feeling kinda lost, asking the internet.

my grandparents i’ve lived with for years now, have gotten to be very mean and cruel, i was able to visit hamilton last year around september and it was amazing i bought a water bottle with money i earned and was proud of myself for but i get home and i get in trouble for it and even today it’s brought up how i’m an idiot and can’t be trusted with money

fh7v28,Does making me and my sister fight count as abuse????,"This happened about 3 weeks ago, and I can't stop thinking about it.

Me and my sister got in a fight and she went and told my father about it, he said that he would not deal with this and that we had to fight each other. 

No rules, punching, choking, everything allowed. 

I immediately shook my head, but he said there was no backing out of it. My mom sat there and didn't comment.

So we got on opposite sides of the room. I was panicking really hard because my sister really wanted to hurt me, and my dad really wanted me to fight. I played it cool so he wouldn't get mad at me again. 

He counted down and my sister ran towards me.

I slammed her down. really hard. I flipped her on her back and started choking her and my dad told me don't stop. He started yelling at her to do anything, kick me, punch me, bite me, anything.

My mom calmly told us to stop it, but dad said to shut up.

I got back up because she was crying really hard, and I felt a rush of adrenaline, like ""He said I was the victor, I can't let her beat me!""

She was a lot more pumped up, and we had a round two.

I won again and she started choking. I realised her, and dad said that we needed to leave and take our s**t with us.

So I went back to doing my chore. My sister was crying on the couch, my mom came in and started tending to her. She told me I shouldn't of done that. 

I got really mad and said ""What would you do if you were me then?"" and she just said ""Not go along with it"" and I started bawling, she just stared at me then went back to patting my sisters back.

My mom went into their room and demanded he apologized to us. He yelled for us and sarcastically told us sorry that we couldn't handle it and that we were little p****s, and that's how he was taught. 

I started to tear up again and he told us to go off and cry, so I ran into my room and just leaned against the door, listening to my mom just talking to him with a calm tone of voice. 

Everyone is upset and crying, I went and contacted my online friend later and sent her tons of voice messages with me crying and bawling about it. 

She seemed unconcerned and just said my dad was a jerk, and started talking about ways to prevent me and my sister arguing, and I don't know what to do.

This is the most extreme thing, but now I can't get the feeling of me choking her and actually feeling proud out of me. I'm such a terrible person.


I never should of went along with it, but I think this is abuse right? Or is it just weird fighting everyone does??????

Currently he has signed away his parental rights, and my kids and I live with my family thousands of miles away from his. The kids struggle with abandonment, as well as some of the things they have learned to be ""normal"" from their father. 

My daughter was so young when I left and he ""doesn't do babies"" so he hardly interacted with her. But my son struggles immensely with anger, he will scream, yell, and physically fight people. He has improved since getting away but I just feel so frustrated on his behalf.

fhj7ym,Can emotional abuse occur online too?,"I was in a crazy situation with an (online) friend that went on (or on/off) for months. From what I remember, she made at least one horrible threat, tried to twist my words, made fun of me, and in general, I felt like I was walking on eggshells. Those aren’t all of the things that happened. The reason(s) she  supposedly did these things seem so ridiculous and childish—and that drives me crazy. However, I keep thinking to myself that her real reason was that she wanted to control me. Those silly reason(s) were just excuse(s).

But even though that‘s in the past, I’ve been affected by it. I’ve had dreams and nightmares that are related directly or indirectly to what happened—for years. Random things can remind me of the person or what happened. I have episodes of panic or lingering anxiety. Sometimes I feel so numb or extremely sad for weeks. Sometimes I can barely concentrate on my college studies or even sleep well. Also, I have an autoimmune disease (ulcerative colitis) which can be influenced by stress—and this is beyond stressful.

fhkay1,About to be forced to live in abusive situation. Please help.,"I hope this is the right sub for this. I am in desperate need of help. I am female. 

My dad is and has always been verbally and physically abusive. My mom lives with him and enables his behavior because she has no choice, he is the one who makes money. He has never had any close friends since I've been alive. If someone ever came to the house when I was growing up, he would run and hide to avoid. He still does this, even if it's the pizza delivery guy coming to the door. At work, he is very quiet and everyone there thinks he is just mild-mannered polite guy. As soon as he gets home, he is a different person. Because of this, I have NO witnesses that could see his behavior. I've always suspected he has something like Borderline Personality Disorder. My family would never admit to something like this as they live in denial about everything. 

Last week, I was in a pinch and had to borrow a couple hundred dollars. This is NOT something that happens regularly, or ever at all. It made me sick to ask and I felt terrible, but let me be clear he has PLENTY of money and this is not hurting him by any means. Asking made me humiliated and he made sure to let me know how bad I should feel. Since I haven't been able to pay it back yet, he called me yesterday screaming and throwing a fit and sent me a bunch of horrible messages about how awful I am. This is nothing new as he has always been known to have complete freak outs over little issues and blow everything out of proportion. 

Here's my problem: I have some serious bills piling up and cannot make the payments plus the rent I need for this month. I am working full-time but everything is just too much. I desperately want to take out a loan but I haven't established my credit for long enough. The only thing I can do is go stay with them. 

I am so scared of having to go stay with him and have my dog and myself get abused. The last time we visited, my puppy gets very excited to see people, and he had a meltdown from the dog resting his chin next to him on the couch. He started hitting my freaking puppy over it!! Over just wanting attention/to be petted. It was horrifying. It's so hard to explain his personality because everything is like, ""How could you do that?"" He has serious rage issues that he's never been able to control and he flips out over tiny things. Then afterwards, he would act like nothing happened. It's coming down to my only option of having to stay with him and I've been up for days crying about it. For anyone who's lived with mental/physical abusers, you know that just being around these people deteriorates your mental health and causes permanent damage. 

I'm wondering if there's any subs where I might be able to find a temporary spot to stay with my dog for a month or two so I do not have to be near this. If I didn't have my dog, I would seriously be considering suicide.

fhkwv5,My ex and I,"The day I left my ex for good, it started out that I had the flu. I was unwell and had asked him if he could grab me some ginger ale and gravol. He ignored me the first time, so thinking perhaps he didn't hear the question I ask again, he gets up and starts huffing and puffing how I'm a lazy bitch. I am useless, worthless, can't do a single thing my damn self. No wonder I'm so fat.
For weeks before this he would comment while I stacked the dishwasher ""Is THAT seriously how YOUR going to stack the dishwasher? Ugh, Can't you do anything right? Your such a stupid cunt.""
I'd ask him a valid question and he'd snap ""You fucking serious? Stupid bitch."" I'd ask him if hes eating dinner with me as I'd worked all day came home and cooked dinner and wanted us to have dinner together. He was home playing video games (As per usual for him). He looks at me and responds with ""Does it look like I wanna sit on the couch and watch a stupid move with YOUR ass?""
I'd walk away... I'd feel like crying but I remember only the weak cry (He'd tell me that all the time). I took it and took it until I couldn't anymore, and I tried to speak to him about it. He would respond yet again disrespectfully. ""Dumb bitch I dont want to hear your stupid voice."" I had noticed that he would ignore me for this girl he was playing with on the game (GTA5) I told him I wasn't comfortable with being his slave while he got to find partner after partner. I wanted a husband not a child. So he gets mad and tells me to ""Shut my fucking face"". So I said fine. So I go downstairs to have a smoke, and he took my entire pack of cigarettes (every. single. last. one.) He left me with NOTHING left. I lost it. Smoking was the only thing keeping me sane, it's all I had to hold onto during all this stress. 
I told him ""How dare you take my entire pack, take the food I bought and made, take money from me and treat me like garbage. How dare you!! I am NOT your personal ATM. I am not your sugar Mama and I never signed up for this. It's your fault you do not work, your constantly on that stupid video game all day and night. How can you find a job if you waste ALL your time on that?! You over-drafted all of my accounts stole 1300 freaking dollars from your last employer and tried to blame ME. I don't and never will commit crimes. I know better than doing the crap your pulling. I'm done, I'm leaving this place.""
So he gets up and tells me he's ""outta here"". I got pissed at him and gave him shit and made a comment about his cheating (I know wrong) and told him I'm done being his bank machine. I'm taking all of the clothes I bought him and giving them to someone who doesn't disrespect me.
He shoves past me and low and behold he emptied my pack of smokes into HIS PACK on purpose. I was fuming at this point. So I pack all of the stuff I paid for, as well as my own personal belongings ( I called a womens shelter that morning after the dinner fiasco).
This man had no money, was not working, and stole from me. 
During this, he grabs my face, pushes me to the ground, and punches me repeatedly in the ribs. When he's done I got up and walked towards the living room to leave and call the police so he threw me into a table.
His friend comes out and BLAMES THE ENTIRE THING ON ME. I brought it on myself. Never mind the weeks of berating and pushing me to the point I snap, That doesn't count because hes just a grumpy guy and ""Can't help it"" according to his friends he is ""depressed"" and I'm the ""Big bad wolf"". 
This guy cheated numerous times, physically abused me if I called him out on his shit, and treated me like absolute garbage.
Between him, his friends, and a few members of my family, I can find no better and might as well settle with what I have.",beanmoon86,2020-03-12 11:23:17,2,746,16.74,51.07,42.33,1,13.81,10.72,94.1,59.65,25.74,20.91,11.8,0.13,2.55,6.3,0.13,4.83,5.09,10.99,8.71,4.29,8.85,2.95,20.38,4.83,2.01,1.07,0.67,2.28,7.51,1.47,5.76,0.13,3.22,0.94,16.35,0.4,0.94,0.4,6.84,9.38,1.61,1.21,1.74,1.61,2.55,2.14,1.88,0.67,0.67,0.4,3.75,1.34,0.8,0.27,1.74,8.45,2.01,1.74,2.01,2.68,0.4,7.37,9.52,0.54,12.33,2.01,5.5,4.83,0.94,1.21,0.94,1.21,0,0,2.95,1.88,0.27,0,0.4,0,19.03,6.57,3.35,0,0,0.67,0.4,0.13,2.68,3.62,1.61,0
fhr265,Friend needs help! How to help?,"**\*TW/CW: domestic abuse, physical abuse, psychological abuse, verbal abuse - all from intimate partner violence\***

**(Friend wrote this to me so I'm copying/pasting this here because I have ZERO idea how to help them, here's some quick stats: friend is mid 20s working a very low income job, their partner is early 30s and financially dependent on them, they've been dating for 5-10 years at this point)**

**TLDR (this is a long post):**

1 - - Brief  history given (partner has severe mental illness that affects their impulse and emotional control) where author writes 'it's just been getting worse'

2 - - Partner has severe problem with anger management, impulse control, seems to have ""convient amnesia"" about conversations and events that happened and then gets mad when partner tells them 'this did happen' 

3 - - Partner has a history of physical violence against person, psychological abuse, emotional abuse, verbal abuse against the person

4 - - Person can't get in contact with local domestic abuse support group and can't physically attend meetings

5 - - There is about 11k worth of debt, person is worried their car will be repoed since they can't physically pay it back themselves due to low income levels

6 - - Person is in a long distance poly relationship where said third partner hasn't been informed about the impulse and anger problems associated with the abuser

7 - - Person is asking for help for how to prepare to leave this relationship (person does have dependent personality disorder adding to the difficulty)

Brief history: We have been dating about 8 years at this point. It didn't start out abusive. It didn't get abuse until about 3 years in and slowly has been cascading into the hell that it's become (slowly becoming more and more severe).

Anyway, my partner got diagnosed with a severe case of mental illness about year 3 into the relationship (part of the symptoms deal with emotional regulation). I know, I probably should have left there and then but I didn't. I thought I could help them deal with it but their anger problems have only been getting worse. 

They have a SEVERE problem with impulse control and anger management (they've described it to me once as ""one moment I was picking something up and the next I realized I had broken the object"" almost like they were describing temporary amnesia because their anger was so severe. They grew up in a home with severe domestic violence (they never said what specifically - physical, verbal, whatever). They have the nerve to say I'M THE ABUSER being ""neglectful"" when I feel like because of their treatment of me I'm so scared of saying the ""wrong thing"" because he's just going to call me ""stupid"" (repeatedly) or physically hurt me.

So the first time they physically struck me I thought it was a 'flash in the pan' moment and would never happen again. How dumb of me. They've destroyed my property (it was relatively inexpensive things but it's still upsetting cause of sentimental value and all that jazz). 

It feels like I'm walking on bombshells with them. The slightest of minorest of inconveniences? They start shouting. I would make excuses why I couldn't go to important social events that I wanted to go to because they basically guilt-tripped me with saying things like (""But I'll be REALLY lonely if you leave me"" and similar crap). 

There's a local domestic abuse support group in my town that meets once a week every week but because of the timing I really can't attend the meetings. I can't find a way to contact them otherwise outside the meetings (emails, phone, etc.). 

The other issue is my dependent personality disorder. Every logical part of my brain is screaming pack as much shit as you can into your car and drive to a friend's house in town and spill your guts out to them regarding the relationship and then in the morning drive to your family (I also feel like I've been a victim of pathological shaming because whenever I tried to even slightly HINT at what was happening they'd just tell me ""Well just pack your stuff and drive out, just walk out that door"" when my mental illness and other stuff makes that difficult to do. I also feel like I've shamed myself because all my life I've been a strong advocate of helping victims of domestic abuse and now I see myself in this hell hole of a relationship.

The other part is severe financial debt. We took out a loan of about 11k (how much we owe right now back) to pay off other payments so instead of having like 5 payments there was only going to be 1 payment of that big loan. Anyway, since it's not paid off (And I'm literally only making $700-900 a month right now), I physically can't afford to pay off the loan. I'm so scared that if I leave and the partner stops paying then I'm going to get my car repoed, my only mode of transportation (and like you see, I really can't afford to make a payment on the loan by myself with how little I bring in).

I just hate lying to co workers (I work in preventative medicine) about my relationship, pretending it's all roses and sunshine when in reality we are arguing just about once every 1-3 days over stuff that's really inconsequential (HE'S the one making a big deal out of minor problems - quick example, I accidentally dropped the cap of a bottle of soda in the car the other day. His response? I grabbed my soda bottle in my hand and tossed it out the car in a rage halfway across the field we were parked by. I want to add spice to my meal? He screams at me to ""never do it again"" and demands I throw it away or ""he'll burn me on the stove top"". 

Really what's made me finally write this is the fact that he beat the shit out of my back because when he asked if I was going to cook some food for a professional (they knew I was just going to cook the food and then return home, not even eat the meal and said professional wasn't even going to be there the entire time I was there so no 'jealousy' problems) I said ""Yes"" because when I asked him not even 3 hours earlier ""Hey, XYZ asked for me to cook food for him, you want to join me so I have company?"" HE said ""yes"". It's like he completely forgot he agreed not even 3 hours earlier. 

These ""convenient amnesia"" happens so much now. He gets pissed off about an event/conversation because he thinks it didn't happen (WHEN IT DID) and takes his rage out by screaming at me and/or physically striking me.

We are currently involved in a long distance poly relationship too where the girl has zero idea of the guy's impulse problems so that adds to the complexity of the situation.

So my ultimate question is this: HOW THE HELL do I start the process of getting away from this monster? I'm tired of lying and saying ""everything is okay"" when in reality IT IS NOT.",gothicxtoy,2020-03-12 17:47:10,3,1217,41.86,46.38,72.39,1,30.42,17.42,91.54,55.05,16.6,11.5,6.9,0.49,0.66,1.15,2.3,5.09,5.51,13.39,8.55,8.13,7.56,1.89,16.76,3.04,1.64,1.97,2.38,1.89,7.48,0.9,6.57,0.49,3.04,0.41,10.93,0.08,1.23,0.08,1.31,11.18,1.81,2.79,1.56,1.15,1.23,3.53,2.14,0.25,1.15,0.66,3.04,0.66,1.48,0,0.9,8.46,3.29,0.58,2.96,1.15,1.15,4.52,10.85,1.23,15.04,2.55,6.57,6.41,2.55,0.41,0.9,1.81,0.25,0,1.4,0.66,0.16,0.25,0.08,0.16,19.06,2.79,2.3,0.33,0,0.49,0.08,1.73,2.3,4.35,2.96,1.73
fhvy5d,"Life-long struggle to recover, TRIGGERED today","As a child, I had a father who was mostly absent because of his job, a mother who was depressed and not always aware of what was going on with the kids, and an older(+7yr) brother(call him Bill) who was jealous of me because our mother paid less attention to him after I was born.  Suffice to say I suffered at the hands of my brother.  My memories are of ear pulling, Chinese torture, being locked in the dryer and it being turned on, being dragged up and downstairs in a sleeping bag, being locked out in my underwear in the winter, and a whole slew of daily reminders that I was ugly fat and dumb.  In my adult years my mother has been brave enough to reveal that at my three-month checkup they had asked the doctor about the bruises all over my legs.  The doc said it was from trying to walk.  I was too disgusted to ask her questions when she revealed this, but am thankful for her candor. 

So my adult life has been a series of ups and downs.  I have a lot of pent up rage that is always simmering and feel depressed most of the time. I can't even describe the other feeling I get.  Nothing.  Vague. Despondent. Issues with marijuana and alcohol have been a part of my life since I was a preteen. I was able to hold down a quick service manager job for 7 years and got fired for paying myself for days I took off.  I don't think I have been able to handle working for longer than 6 months in the last decade.  I am often uncomfortable around people, especially men.  Men who are loud or big or sometimes men who remind me of my brother.  I don't generally get along well with menly men or dominate type people.  Most of my friends have been women.  I am not sure if I really have friends now.  I usually destroy relationships because I can't handle the physical and emotional intimacy.

So you won't be surprised(or maybe you will) to learn I live at home with my parents.  I have tried to forgive them in the past, and I feel like I have made headway with my mother.  Our relationship is pretty good.  I clean up after myself and help keep the house clean.  I pay rent when I'm working. Generally, if we fight it's about something silly, but I can't recall the last time we had a disagreement.  We have talked about the past and even though I am somewhat frustrated by her lack of full disclosure, I also understand and appreciate that she has tried to help me.

With my father, it is a lot different.  He has acknowledged that I was hurt as a result of his neglect when I was a kid, but the only thing he will say when I bring it up is he is ashamed.  He won't discuss any particulars or specifics.  From what I know I can see that my dad was brought up in a VERY conservative household.  I think he may have been beaten by his parents, so perhaps he thinks my focus on my abuse is overreacting.  The whole baby boomer generation seems to have thought that men were made to work and being emotionally repressive was a tool men regularly used to get through this gruelling ideology.  My father shares his glib happiness, bad jokes and odd chuckles at things that I cannot discern the humor in.  He occasionally shows anger, but not very often.  

He is a real estate salesmen and he smokes weed regularly and at his age the effects on his mind are obvious.  I am a pothead too so it is pretty obvious to me that his memory and social issues aren't solely the work of aging.  The weed is making it harder for him to function day to day.  Actually this observation has been so helpful to me.  I notice the things that I do and the effects on me from smoking because I see them in him first.  I am now trying for the 999 time to detox.  Stopped alcohol and getting ready to stop pot.  It is challenging with him around smoking and drinking but I can always just camp out in my room to get away from it.

It is the invasion of my space that bugs me.  He will stand directly behind me while I am on the couch, he always brushes past me or takes up space in pinch points throughout the house.  He always wants to hug and kiss.  I have told him over and over again that this is not enjoyable to me.  I usually stay clear of him and will hug him on occasion because I know he likes it.  To be clear, I love them and understand that they have no obligation to house me.  I am thankful for all of the good things they have done for me.  I would say that if I was more traditionally conservative they would be more likely to support me, but I will live with my feminist vegetarian philosophy over money and success any day.

I have been talking with my parents about the coronavirus and what kind of precautions to take.  They don't get around the internet well so I was just mentioning they might not want to go visit family in a couple of weeks.  We talk about being six feet away, not touching your face, washing your hands' yadda yadda.  We watch some Better Call Saul(soooo good) and then mom goes to sleep and I stay on the couch reading Ronan Farrows' new book while my father perused the internet.  He gets up and kind of does his clean up before he goes to bed, stands behind me(which he does so often that I don't look up to see what he is doing) leans over and KISSES(wet) my forehead.

""Dad!""  I say loudly in an angry tone.

He responds with the quick 'I'm sorry' and then babbles something about we live together and just is not sincere in his apology.  I said something like ""You're going to be one of THOSE people?""  with the image of Rudy Gobert touching every microphone in reach fresh in my mind.

He went to bed after that and I tried to read my book but couldn't focus.  I decided to come here and put it out there just cause I have to get this off my chest.  I am planning on sitting down and once again discussing my feelings about personal boundaries, but I just wish there was a way I could get him to understand.  It wasn't just the coronavirus part that bugged me.  I DON'T generally like physical contact with anyone beyond a handshake.  And honestly handshakes with large or scary men kind of sucks for me too!

My family is on vacation in Portugal and me  and my brother are alone. I don't know how old I was but it was about 5 to 8. But I wasn't able to ejeculat just yet. Anyways, my brother asked me to go behind the house. He was masturbading, I turned and was on my way back into the house. But he called me and asked me to sit down. He then asked me to touch it and I did reluctantly.
He asked me to masturbate and explain me some stuff about the body and such. There also a dog and my brother made him lick his glans. He asked me if I want that to but I refused and he accepted that. That somewhat became a habit and we masturbate together. He asked me to suck his dick after we got back from Portugal and he talked me into taking it into the mouth. I didn't like it and moved away. The whole atmosphere in the room was strange and I got back to my room. I recall him telling me that I shouldn't tell anyone but I'm not shure about that. I don't know where the following incident falls into the time line but I and my brother showered together and he started swinging his dick into my direction and he came quite close. I took that as a joke but I'm not shure about that anymore. Btw it is quite normal in Europe to shower with the siblings... don't know about America tough. But the second part isn't that normal. :/
Well my memory about all of that isn't that clear anymore and I'm not shure what to make out of it. :/

fi0l9j,F18 leaving emotionally abusive family during coronavirus.,"F18 leaving emotionally abusive family during coronavirus.

Hi guys. My dad (45) is emotionally abusive. My stepmom (39) is not. My little brother (5) is as sweet as can be. I’ve been dealing with this issue for a long time and I need to leave. I can’t deal with this any longer. My dad controls all of my finances, so I’m very financially dependent on him. I have to quickly type this up because I don’t know when they’re coming back upstairs. My school and hour and a half away from home got shut down because of the coronavirus. Students can still live on campus, but need a valid reason. Here is my current plan:

Tonight at midnight:
-Pack my bags (not much, everything that was in my dorm is in my car, I can easily move it back to school)
-drive 1.5 hours to school
-immediately go to campus safety
-get my keys from campus safety, move my boxes back
-leave my car at the parking lot (I don’t know if the title is in my name and my dads, just me, or just my dad)
-have my friend pick me up, or walk a few miles to their house
-spend the night there
-call my bank (my dad is the primary on the account, we can both take and add funds to the account)
-apply for jobs
-work on schoolwork (they switched to online classes now)

I live in Virginia. Some concerns I have are my bank, the car, my phone that was bought as a gift, etc. my phone plan is on my dads account so I’d have to figure out that. Might get a burner phone. I’m leaving the car in the school parking lot because I don’t know about the title. Oh! Another concern.

My car has a hum tracker on it. I planned on taking it out and leaving it in my homes mailbox. My dad is a private investigator so he could easily track me. But I don’t care.

fi4mj3,My friend says things that make me worry about her,"Ok so I met my friend at the beginning of the school year in September, and we’ve gotten pretty close. I’ve never noticed her talking bad about her parent or her home life (except for her mom which I’ll get into later.) So I’ve never assumed anything until today. We were walking from our last class to lunch and I made a comment about how I was tired and I’d rather be at home. And btw she was acting really different than usual... She was very quiet and usually she talks a lot which I think is a red flag. Anyway, after I commented, she kind of mumbled “I’d rather be at school than my house...” My mom was abused by her step dad (he hit her and screamed endlessly at her) and I remember my mom saying the same thing, that she liked being at school rather than at her house. So that’s why my mind immediately went to abuse. And I didn’t want to scare her? Idk I just didn’t want to immediately ask in the middle of a school hallway if she was being hurt in anyway so I asked her if it was boring at her house and she said “no, things just happen...” That doesn’t sound good so I was like you’re worrying me, are you ok? And she was started mumbling and I couldn’t hear her but I think I heard her say “not mentally” which scared me. So I was like if you ever need to talk to me you can and I’d never judge you for anything, and she didn’t really respond but I felt bad changing the topic. She eventually said “everyone thinks I’m crazy,” and “I always mess it up when I talk to people because I don’t stop” and I was like no you’re not crazy you can talk to me and idk she just didn’t say anything after that. Now about her mom... She’s told me that her mom is overreactive and she was scared to tell her mom she hurt her leg because she hurt it last year and didn’t want her mom to freak out. I get not wanting to piss your mom off but like my friend could not walk. I told her to go to the nurse but she still wouldn’t. It was just strange and her not wanting to tell her mom made it even stranger. Another thing about her mom... She shuts off my friend’s apps on her phone because “she feels like it” - my friend. What?! Literally my friend gets good grades and she’s in all sorts of school groups so it makes no sense that she’s getting her apps randomly turned off. I don’t think it’s a reach to say some type of abuse is happening at her house with her mom, possibly her dad. She’s an only child too so she’s the only child they can target. Not to mention she’s bi and her parents are against that... idk if they found out but it makes me wonder and I’m worried for her. I’ve tried to get her to be more open with me but I can’t force anything so I don’t know what to do.

fi5ecb,Does this count as abuse? Neighborhood drama,"So I was in the backyard playing with my son when I overheard my neighbors next door and their 8yo son. They have a pool and they were pressuring him to open his eyes underwater. They wanted him to let go of the side of the pool in the deep end, stick his head under, and open his eyes. He seemed terrified. He was bawling very loudly and talking about how he wanted to leave. His parents kept saying he wasn't allowed to get out of the water until he did this, the reason being so he could learn to handle himself in the water and become more confident. They were saying how it was ridiculous to be afraid. The kid started freaking out and saying he wanted to be anywhere but home and the dad started talking about how lucky the kid was to live in a nice house with parents and not be an orphan on the streets of Somalia or wherever. Then the kid started screaming ""help me, help me"" and they just kept telling him to shut up. This went on for at least 30 minutes, maybe longer because it was in full swing by the time we got outside.

Is that abuse or am I overreacting?",Fournote,2020-03-13 12:36:31,0,218,53.5,89.21,25.09,5.86,16.77,14.22,95.41,60.09,16.06,13.3,3.21,0.46,0,6.88,2.75,2.75,7.34,15.6,9.17,5.96,10.55,0.92,22.48,5.5,1.83,2.29,0.46,0.92,5.5,1.83,3.67,1.38,1.38,0,18.81,2.29,0.92,0,8.26,10.09,1.83,2.75,1.83,2.75,0.46,2.29,3.67,0.92,2.75,0,2.75,1.38,0.46,0,0.92,7.8,3.21,0.46,4.13,1.83,0,9.17,7.34,0.46,18.35,1.83,11.93,4.59,0.46,1.83,2.75,0,0,0,0.46,0.46,0,0,0,0,9.17,4.59,2.29,0,0,0.92,0,0,0.92,0.46,0,0
fi6bsg,I [28m] left a horrible situation and feel like I did something wrong.,"I will try to condense this as much as I can.

I've known my former boss for most of my life. He was my martial arts teacher since I was 8. I started working for him at age 17, and worked for him for 7 years.

He is a very influential person, tons of charisma, but can be extremely manipulative and is a professional gaslighter. For example, when I was 18 and just enrolling in college classes, my classes interfered with my martial arts training schedule. Naturally, I chose school over recreation. After telling him this, he said he was disapointed that I didnt plan my school around my training. His treatment toward me after this point wasn't as loving.

He would plan out things for me without my consent. For example, he shifted the training regiments to more of a fight preparation camp, and then one day out of the blue he says ""when you fight in (blank) tournament...blah blah blah""
Umm...I never said I wanted to fight. I told him ""I feel like I've been forced into this situation"" and he got up and said ""well, I guess I'm not gonna guide you anymore"" and walks away.

This really made me resentful. But at the same time, our relationship has always involved camaraderie. He was like a mixture of a father figure and a big brother. We travelled the world together, had crazy experiences, I was his apprentice pretty much. Except I always felt on edge around him and he had very high expectations of me all the time. 

He pushed his ideologies on me and if I disagreed he would ostracize me. Examples: he wanted me to invest in a alkaline water machine, and when I told him I dont beleive in it, he gave me shit. He told me I would regret not fighting in the big tournaments. This is gaslighting right?

When we were travelling he was driving drunk and almost put us off a cliff.  I yelled in panic. Afterward he told me he would kick my ass if I ever yelled ""like a bitch ever again"" I lost all respect for him.

Fast forward to the current dilema:
After I left for college, i was feeling horrible about the line of work i chose. I called him to have a heart to heart and he suggested i move back home and work for him as a graphic designer for his new lifestyle brand. I agreed. We came to an agreement for me to work 30 hours a week for 1200 dollars per month. That's 10 bucks an hour. His demands increased, and before you know it I was working 7 days a week and would be putting in like 50+ hours per week for the same pay. I said F this, and without warning I just left. I blocked him, ran away, and haven't talked to him since. 

Its been almost a year and I think about him constantly, almost feels like Stockholm syndrome, I always have nightmares of him looking for me, looking to get even with me, looking to hurt me, I'm scared if we ever cross paths he would hurt me. I loved him at times, I hated him at times. I cant help but feel like I did something bad by just leaving without saying goodbye. It felt like that was the only way out. Like I escaped the mafia. Hes dead to me, and I want to stop thinking about him. What should I do?

Tldr: left an abusive relationship but feel like I did something horrible.

fi6j2v,Your Friends Who Support Narcs Are Toxic Too,"This time two years ago I found out my narc was cheating me, and while ultimately it was the best thing to happen to me, I still remember the pain, shame, and insecurity I felt and just felt so fooled. Throughout our relationship, many friends of mine would privately ask if he hit me and offered to help me move out while he was at work, of course, I was too brainwashed and afraid to and couldn’t afford to live on my own at the time. I still live with so much pain and flashbacks from all of the horrendous things he did so I am easily triggered around the holidays this time of year and when I see posts of friends still being in contact with him and lying to themselves thinking we simply weren’t a match or give him the “boys will be boys” excuse infuriates me. I maintained contact with his friends for awhile since I moved to a new state for him not knowing anyone and eventually I learned from a lot of accounts online, my favorite being \*\*@he\_never\_hit\_me\_but\*\*, that even though I had no contact with him, associating with people who were ok with his behavior and/or still value him as a friend are not healthy to be around for healing. Some people are simply horrible people, it’s easier to admit to ones you see on tv instead of someone you went to school with, but this dismissal of behavior only perpetuates it and does not support you or other survivors. It also shows how manipulative your narc is to people who aren’t their supply. Learn to let go of those who are toxic, it is hard, but keeping them in your life is like drinking poison and keeping you bonded to your narc.",blowdontpopclouds,2020-03-13 13:47:01,1,312,24.86,72.87,48.89,25.77,39,15.06,92.95,63.46,20.51,14.42,6.73,0.64,2.56,3.53,0.96,6.09,3.21,15.71,8.65,8.01,9.62,2.56,16.99,2.88,1.28,1.92,0.32,1.6,6.41,3.21,3.21,1.28,0.96,0,16.99,0,2.56,0,4.17,11.54,2.88,1.28,0.96,2.56,0.64,4.81,2.56,0.96,0,1.6,3.53,0.32,2.88,0,0.32,5.45,3.21,1.28,1.6,0.32,0,5.45,8.65,0.64,10.9,1.92,3.21,5.77,1.92,0.96,0,0.32,0,0,0.32,0,0,0.32,0,0,14.42,2.24,4.49,0,0,0,0,0,0.64,1.28,0,5.77

fid2ko,Abuse Trigger Warning- Rant,"So my dad was a drunkard, a liar, a drug addict, a cheater, and an abusive son of a bitch. He was in my life until I was eleven and until then he did everything in his power to utterly wreak me. I have four other siblings, but since I am the oldest i was at the end off all of his abuse. And there have been times when he would beat my other siblings and then immediately turn around and apologize and croon over them, but when he did so to me he would just lock me in a closet or some shit. At 8 years old I thought that this was completely normal behaviour and I had no way to tell anyone since he had us move to the middle of nowhere. When I was 9 he beat me so hard that he knocked me out and I had bruises on my back for 3 months after that.  He would burn me, throw me around, and try to kill me multiple times. Out house's walls were full of walls with holes in them because he would throw me against them so much. He would beat me with belts, wood, metal rods, arrows, his fists, and he even shot me once. And EVERY time he did this, he would find a way to religiously justify what he did (and this is partly why I am no longer religious). He even had the audacity to tell my brothers never to hit a woman even though he would beat my mother on an almost daily basis.  He did everything except for sexual abuse to me. I was mentally, physically, verbally, and emotionally tortured during some of the most crucial parts of my life. He threatened to kill me if I ever ""Chose"" to be gay or trans (I am trans and panromantic) and he would savagely beat me if he ever caught me doing something ""Gay"".  One night, I was sleeping in the bed with my mother, and my dad came in, drunk and probably on meth,  and threw me across the room. This was normal behaviour for me, but my mother realized what was happening and got us out of there. Homelessness, fear, and several restraining orders later we are finally somewhat stable. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, PTSD,  and I am extremely paranoid. I have struggled with self-harm and suicide for years and I have been having suicidal thoughts since I was 4. I'm nowhere close to complete recovery, I honestly don't think there is such a thing. But it does get better. I'm not saying everything is going to be all sunshine and daises, but if you surround yourself with supportive people and try to find help, it won't fix everything, but it sure as hell will help.

Thus turned into a vent but im setiously concered. Is memory loss normal? Could there be stuff i dont remember even my mom doesnt know, that i might never know? I mean i guess it better not to remember it all since what i do is stressful enough but it still bothers me. Also if my spelling is terrible in so sorry i typed this really fast.

(Im not sure if i should  post this in r/ mentalhealth or r/ abuse so i will both)

[A bit on me]
Im not sure this matters but i will add just in case
.
Im 21 [F] I have dealt with self harm since 14, been severely suicidal around 17 eventually being hospitalised with led up to leaving my fathers abuse. Im still very (irrationally) terrified to leave the house ( therefor causing me to drop out because the idea of going from a high school with 100 kids to thosandswhen i already spend all day cooped up in a room alone with the school consoler due to anxiety in a school of 100 kids was already way to stressful), lost all my friends by 18 due to moving cities. And i am no longer taking meds or in therapy because i have no money or healthcare so i cant get professional help right now and all this with remebering  has me so stressed angry and confued. 
.
[About my father, abuse and memory loss]
 I've been aware for some time that i really cant remember parts of my childhood, just tiny fragments of memory here and there, mainly of school life (school was kinda like a safe place maybe thats why?) But apparenly its parts of my teen 
life now too. 
Im not really sure how to explain things since its always seemed like somthing people wouldnt belive (maybe im just worrying that) but i will try my best.
So up until i was 17 i lived with my abuser (my father) along with 2 siblings and my mom. Thing were usually just emotional abuse i guess (from what i remember anyways). So i should probably  give a bit of of background on my fatger or this may not make since. My father has belived many things (it changes all the time) but the main thing is he is Einstein's (yes Albert Einstein) grand or great grand (i tried to ignore the specifics) son. Because he is this he belives the goverment is after him (for his brain). He also belives that he is the writer of many popular books, movies, tv shows and even sone songs, and they are all stolen from him. (Examples are anything Tim Burton, many newer disney stuff like frozen, princess and the frog, tv shows suc; as modern family. Anything with adam sandler , the list goes on and on and on and is always growing) because of this companies like sony are out to kill him. But not just him me and my siblings also. (But more on that in a bit.) Also he thinks people would bug our house and stufff like that. 
Due to all this we were raised being told that these companies were out to get us. We were told the would kindnap us, then rape us, sell us to sex trafficing, or just kill us (or all of the above). This was beat into our heads ever day from a young age. And as small children who dont know any better why would you think for a second you parent would lie about this stuff?. Anyway on top of that he would constantly put us dont call us names ect. He also wpuld not let us have other kids over to the house, go to other kids homes, see our family (exept a few times like 1 or 2 times a year ) or anything like that. Even exiting the house to go inthe yard require non stop supervision even into our teens. (stuff i learned later in school was abuse later on)  but idk im gonna try just to go into stuff that feels like it really needs explained about him i guess.  So thats kinda a short summary on what he was like (if you can call that short there so much more it would be imposible to try and put it all down.)

Anyway me and my mom were talking to my uncle today about how he had a mask for everone and place ( at home normal him, im public a complete diffrent man, a loving father to our brother who was living on his own, and various othera) and how the person he seen was not who we experianced. Then we started talking about how he made us live and how he killed and abused our animals (We had no hot water, our roof caving in, no heat or air, mold everywere, only he got closets we had to use boxes for our stuff, how for many year my sister had no bed but a seat out of a van to sleep on. He would kill our cats and dogs, stab them drown then, my mom only withnessed this but its obivious he was doing it. We just saw him hitting them. At least i thought but lately i have fragments of nemory of watching him drowning kittens telling me it was a ""bath"" and my mom saying when we were reall little we had to watch ihim kill kittens for punishment, i dont remember that part thankfully)  we were then talking about when he turned from jyat emotional to physical with me. I remember the first time clearly. Me and my mom were outside when we started hearing him screaming, my sister crying. Mom went in later her and my sisters came out. Eventually i had to head inside (i dont Remeber the reason) and i walked by him, didnt even totch him. He grabbed by wrist sqweezing them. I said that hurts l, he would let go. ""Dad that hurt, your hurting me, please let go it hurts"" as hes cussing me for bumping him hurting his back. I try to pull away, he knees my leg to stop me, i fall back, he falls with me still holding my wrist. My head not even an inch from smaking the table. I hit the ground him on top of me just as my mom walk in to the house he punches my face my mom yells get off of her, then everthing after thats blank. Aftwr that i remember being pushed to the ground into walls thats it. But my mom continues on what i was telling my uncle. She talked about how he would punch me all the time after that, in the stomach but i dont rememer this part??? I dont remeber the evens and brusing but even then i dont remeber lots of life at home around that time it fuzzy or even completly gone like my memory has been erased. Why cant i remember this??? What if there more i dont remeber, what if stuff happened only i would know but dont? I can remeber being called names, told im going to be killed and raped but not being hit? I would rather remeber being hit than live in constant irrational fear that im not safe due to the fact he conditioned me to belive just that!",Destinylaurie,2020-03-14 06:00:32,3,1242,21.4,45.82,66.71,2.2,21.41,12.24,90.1,59.5,21.18,14.98,8.45,2.33,0.32,3.54,0.32,6.2,3.62,12.88,9.1,7.49,8.05,2.74,16.83,3.95,2.66,1.77,0.97,2.5,5.31,1.29,4.03,0.72,1.61,0.97,12,2.25,0.08,1.37,4.19,14.01,2.33,2.33,1.77,3.3,1.69,4.51,1.85,0.56,0.48,0.81,2.01,0.89,0.81,0.24,0.08,6.76,3.3,1.29,1.53,0.81,0.72,5.31,8.13,1.29,13.61,2.42,5.96,5.39,1.21,0.81,1.21,0.24,0,0.72,0.81,0,0.48,0.08,0,0.32,13.37,4.27,3.46,0,0.08,0.97,0.08,0,0.32,0.16,3.22,0.81
fii49r,Do I tell his friends?,"[context](https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/egrncr/abusive_age_gap_relationship_21f_43m/)

After months of emotional abuse, we broke up (only because I left with ERASMUS, otherwise I would've kept going back to him).

While away, he would still text me very kindly, hearts and kisses and all, checking up on me... but he started posting photos with this woman he was flirting with while I was still there with him :) It broke me, especially since he was so nice to me, I was hopeful we could get back together when I returned...

In some kind of a payback, I recently posted a photo of me drawing a portrait of my 'boyfriend' here. He's just this guy that treats me well, isn't ridiculously older than me, is very fit and handsome and curly hair and all... I just figured he would be very good for me, he is the opposite of my 44y/o abusive ex. It's nothing serious, we go on dates and kiss, I still felt guilty for not telling my ex I'm doing this..

So his response to my post was... to call me horrible names. Dirty slut, whore... nothing he didn't say before, but this time it was so... hypocritical of him. Since he kept posting photos of that woman in his car, at his house etc... and he calls me all these names for posting a portrait of this guy? 

Truth be told, I had also posted a portrait of my ex not too long before this. He even used it as his facebook profile photo. So It might've been a low blow to his ego. He is a control freak and manipulative and cares a lot about his image (he owns a well known club so he is kind of a public figure). Having many friends in common, he must've gone mad seeing my post.

I just... These common friends we have. I have the urge to show them screenshots of our conversations. Because some people at the club used to look at me in pity as if they knew what was going on behind the scenes... I want them to know how he really is.... 

It's a bad idea, I know... I juts felt a connection to some people there but I'm not sure they would be on my side even if I showed them the texts. They might tell him I showed them. And I don't want to know how he would react......

What's going to happen when I get back from ERASMUS? Some of my stuff is still at his place... Seeing him, seeing the club... I get panic attacks thinking about it. It would all come flashing back... the desperation, the traumas, the- I don't know, people must know what he's done to me it's unfair for him to just move on and get away with it all !!",IwontTryAnotherName,2020-03-14 06:10:12,2,486,21.28,58.14,32.72,5.77,13.89,11.93,93.21,60.49,22.84,17.9,8.85,1.03,0,6.58,1.44,4.94,4.32,12.55,9.67,7.82,6.79,1.85,19.34,3.91,1.65,1.44,0,2.26,7.61,2.88,4.73,0.82,1.44,0.82,15.23,0,1.23,0.41,7.2,14.4,2.67,2.47,2.67,2.47,2.47,2.88,3.09,2.47,0.21,0.41,0.62,0.21,0,0.41,0,7,3.91,0,1.85,1.03,0.21,6.58,8.85,1.03,13.17,1.65,6.38,5.14,0.21,1.03,0.21,0.21,0,0,2.67,0.62,1.03,0,0.41,0,27.78,13.99,4.73,0,0,0.62,0.41,0.21,0,3.5,1.23,3.09

filpxd,I Think This Is A Rant,"TW: Abuse

(I posted this on a throwaway on the Derealization Subreddit and ironically, lost the throwaway, so sorry for weird references)

&amp;#x200B;

Hello! So my therapist recently told me I have symptoms of Chronic Disassociation and after a bit of googling, (not trying to self-diagnose lol), I've realized I kinda fit in this criteria? Hello Reddit!!

So I have a really turbulent relationship with my mother, it gets physical a lot to the point that the state requires I get therapy and threatens to remove me.

Anyway that's just background info, but what usually escalates the fights is that once she gets aggressive, I tend to shut down and not respond, which ends up with her getting all riled up and physical.

However, when I look back on it, I normally don't remember the situation and don't understand why I would act like that? My mind is thinking, but my body just does it's own thing. I know I should be trying to deescalate, but when the situation actually happens, I just feel like I'm dreaming, everything feels heavy, I don't really process anything, and I feel numb, like nothing outside of my body is happening anymore, and my mind just thinks about casual things.

I tend to just curl up in a ball once she starts beating me. I just go limp, and let her do whatever, and after she's done, I fall asleep. I vaguely remember the beatings, and just kinda realize something happened, and scrape out the details by inspecting the injuries. Honestly, I feel that method is pretty dumb, considering I just get more injured and she gets angrier.

When I was younger, I used to just take it, until I started running from her when the punishments got more violent. I'd run and lock myself in my room and barricade it, but she'd just break it down, hit me, and get angry over the property damage, hitting me more.

I think I'm giving up.

I'm sorry, I think I've gotten a bit off topic now, anyhow, I used to welcome the feeling, because then I couldn't feel the pain or emotions, but now it's creeping more and more into my life, starting with when she would verbally reprimand me, to daily life.

I just feel like I'm walking in a fog now, my body goes on autopilot, and I'm just inside like ""huh, okay"". I can't remember my life anymore, I hate this. I can't remember anything from the past 2 years. My grades are tanking, because I can't remember any lectures or homework assignments. My life is in shambles and I couldn't care less.

I'm so afraid of coming back too, all I do is have everything crash down on me at once, and I'm just drowning until

\*click\*, nothing matters, go to sleep.

I get random periods of clearness, like now, where I'm back to normal. I'm trying to finish writing this before it comes back, but I think I'm feeling numb again.

I don't even know why I'm writing this. I don't remember.

I just want to fix this, I want it to be okay, but all I do is run from my problems.

Sorry for ranting, I doubt anybody will read this, but it's out there now.

finn6r,Care home,"The boys in my care home kept stealing my food and the staff wouldn't do anything about it. I put salt in my orange juice and they started threatening me so I said I'd been crushing up my medication and putting it in the food to discourage them and they believed me. 

After a week I thought it had all blown over and I started keeping food in a mini fridge I had to buy in my room. When they realised they couldn't steal my food any more they got really angry and got a guy to come round and threaten me. 

He was saying stuff like ""I'm a cage fighter, I don't need guns or knives when I've got these fists"" and ""i will be your worst nightmare, I'll make you scream and beg for your life"". Naturally I found that hilarious and he got really angry that I wasn't scared. He beat the shit out of me. 

I went and told the staff member, who said he'd been watching them beat, choke and kick me on the cctv but hadn't helped. He didn't call the police on them, but he called them on me when I smashed his cup out of anger. I also ripped some jumpers that the boys had left in the lounge. 

Before going to hospital for the head injury I told the staff member that I was worried they would kill my goldfish and he said he wouldn't let them. 

When I got back from the hospital the staff member kept trying to stop me from going upstairs to my room like he was hiding something. When I got there I found that they had trashed all of my stuff including my books, clothes and they had killed my poor goldfish by smashing the tank and flushing her down the toilet. I completely broke down. 

The staff member had watched as 4 people came to the house and joined one of the boys to kick down the door and trash my room. He locked himself in the office and did nothing. 

I got sent to an emergency foster home, then another one the next day and another one the next where I've now been for a few days.

fiwd46,My brother put his hands on me for the first time...,"Today my brother put his hands on me. It wasn't a direct hit of any sort and it was more of a grab of my shoulders/shirt. He shook me and yelled in my face. The reason I take this so personally is because I used to live with my abusive mother who physically and emotionally abused me from a very young age... I have so many traumatic experiences and still find it very hard to get over. I won't get too into it but hopefully, you get the gist of it.  My brother also grew up in this situation way before I was even born (we have a 15 year age gap). He raised me in a way, due to my crappy father being absent I mostly saw him as a father figure. So last year when the abuse and gambling with my mother got really bad he decided to take me in and look after me. He quickly found a job, an apartment and did everything he could to take care of me. And I appreciate it so much because if it wasn't for him I don't think I would be alive today. I genuinely love him and see him as my father. However, he has a tendency to get angry really quickly and yell a lot, it's a habit I guess he developed because of my mother... Yelling is a very big trigger for me no matter what, so each time he yells I fall into a miserable, gloomy state and just end up re-living past trauma. Last night I forgot to turn the stove off (we drink a lot of tea) and I forgot again this morning... I know I screwed up and it's a very risky thing to do. Also expensive. But I've been feeling super unwell and haven't been sleeping at all (not an excuse, just a factor that plays into my forgetfulness). He yelled at me for it and I told him that I was sorry and that I won't do it again. But I also asked him to stop yelling and that he could say whatever he wanted, I just don't want him to yell at me because it is in fact a very big trigger for me. He ended up yelling at me more and telling me not to talk back to him... And I just said that I simply wasn't. I was just letting him know that I was uncomfortable with the yelling. He however just started yelling more and tried smashing my candle. And I told him to stop. He, of course, yelled again and said that I could start talking back once I got a job and paid the bills. Keep in mind I am a full time senior high school student and live in a town with not many jobs to offer. I showed that I was looking for jobs all day online and applied for several jobs... Nope, he just said that if I don't have one I can't 'talk back'. And in my opinion, I feel like I don't talk back, I just say my side and ask him not to yell. I am not the type to be all submissive and not utter a peep if I do that I feel weak and feel exactly how I did with my mother. I just hate feeling weak.

 He later on stormed outside of my bedroom and said that he would ""cave my head in"".. I responded with ""Do it, I don't care anymore."" I really don't, after all I've been through death or pain is the least of my worries really. After he heard that he came running in and grabbed me by my shoulders/shirt and shook me violently. And told me to never talk back to him and push his limits again... As soon as he walked out of my room, I wanted to cry but just called my friend and held in my tears. I don't know what to do... Although sibling violence may be normalized between other families for me this feels like a father I loved just switched up on me... Do I just let it go and apologize? Our arguments seem to get worse and worse each time. I am really scared that physical violence will start to take place. I can't be in this situation ever again... I do feel like something is wrong with me, why do I keep on getting in these situations... first with my mother and now with my brother? I am a common denominator after all... Do I talk back and not realize it? Does anyone have any insight and can provide me with any criticism or advice..?",zeefortune,2020-03-14 22:12:01,3,797,18.5,19.69,86.9,1,15.94,11.17,96.49,62.86,23.09,17.57,12.67,0.38,0.13,4.39,0,5.52,4.14,12.67,8.28,7.03,8.78,3.14,20.58,4.27,2.38,0.88,0.63,2.51,6.52,1,5.52,0.88,2.76,0.63,10.92,1.88,0.13,0.63,5.4,11.67,2.63,1.38,1.51,2.38,1.25,3.89,5.02,0.88,2.38,1.63,2.89,1.13,1.13,0.13,0.25,6.65,1.51,0.63,2.13,1.51,0.88,6.27,12.3,0.75,14.43,1.76,6.52,7.03,1.38,0.5,0.63,0.5,0,0.25,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,0,16.19,9.16,2.26,0,0,0.5,0,0.13,0.5,2.63,0.75,0.25
fiwmx5,Sexual Abuse as a Man,"This is a long story that's been laughed off by people I really love and care about and I just really need to get it off my chest.

When I was in my first year of college, I tended to drink excessively, smoke, and experiment in drugs. 

One night at a party I had gotten much too drunk and too high. It was a mistake, but this was a time in my life I made mistakes. The whole night there was a girl that I had been talking to, a friend of a friend, I didn't really have any interest in her but she seemed to like me but i didn't think it was more than friends. 

At one point in the night I was sitting in a chair and she tried to lean in between my legs and I spun the chair. Wasnt interested in anything because I had just gotten out of a very long relationship and there was only one girl I actually wanted to try dating and it wasnt the one that was hitting on me.

Fast forward into the night and I had had far too much and started puking. I was barely conscious at the time but half way through I feel her hands on my shoulders. Thinking I really dont want anyone here for this I tried to push her away but she didn't budge. 

I got done and rinsed my mouth out and she was leaning in and kissing me. I didn't want this I could barely process it but I didn't want to be with her at all and I pushed her away and she literally pulled me in my my privates so I really had no choice. I thought she was trying to be sexy or something and dismissed it as something that just happened and ducked but then I had some more to drink (not a great time in my life) and I woke up to her pushing a blunt into my face. At this point I had no idea the time or really where I was and I wanted to go home and I didn't want to smoke more so I pushed it away but she pushed it back so I figured just take the hit and she will stop. 

Then I'm on my way to my friends glad to be done with the night and then I woke up at her place. Apparently my friends roommate had said no guests and so the girl had said she could host me and my friends got me there. And left. 

I woke to her in my lap kissing my neck and I couldn't do anything. I tried pushing her off and she pushed my hands behind my back and said I'd like it then with no condom started riding me. I hated every second and couldn't do anything. I wasnt sure if I'd get her pregnant or if I would get an std. And this went on for longer than I wanted and I slept in the corner. I left before she woke and I never saw her again. I dont even know if she got pregnant to this day. 

I told my friend and he laughed at me. He said I was gay for not liking it (hit a little different because I'm a closeted bi) I told the most supportive friends I know and they said it was bad but there was always q downplay. It was never as bad as this. 

I didn't give a shit if it was as bad someone else I still think about it all the time its burned into me and nobody ever gave a shit. The police never did anything. 

The worst part is I got laughed at before when my sociopath exbest friend created an entire identity to catfish nudes out of me in highschool then hold them over my head. I never got over that, and the best part is he may still have them. And I'm tired of being laughed at and dismissed. I thought if there was any place that would take me seriously it was here. All I need to hear is that it wasnt my fault and that it wasnt stupid and that nobody thinks I'm trying to one up other assault survivors. That's it and its eating me alive and I dont know where to go anymore. It's like my fuxking aweful experience isnt bad enough for anyone to care.",gpa_yoda,2020-03-14 22:37:55,10,751,11.43,7.72,93.22,37.55,20.3,9.85,96.4,65.78,23.7,16.78,12.92,0,0,3.46,0.4,6.92,4.53,12.52,10.52,6.39,10.25,3.99,21.84,3.6,2.53,0.53,1.07,2.26,4.93,2.8,2.13,0,0.8,0,8.79,0.27,1.46,3.46,0.53,15.05,2,0.67,2.93,3.86,1.6,5.86,2.13,0.13,1.33,0.53,4.53,1.73,1.33,1.2,0.8,7.19,2.13,1.33,1.2,1.86,0.93,11.32,6.39,0.93,15.58,2,8.92,5.33,0.4,0.53,0.4,0,0,0.13,0.27,0.27,0,0,0,0,8.66,4.79,0.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.4,0.53,0

fj4ts2,Is this abuse or am I just being a jerk?,"Long story warning:

 Hey, I'm new to reddit and I need some advice, I don't feel comfortable sharing this with my actual friends and family because I don't want to come across as insensitive or accidentally cause something that I'll regret for the rest of my life.

 BTW My mom was horribly abused as a kid and I don't know if this is normal for abuse survivers to act like this or if she was actually abusive.

 I'm not great at talking so I'll just write down some incidents that I remember.

 She would always condemn lying in our household, which I guess is understandable, but she wouldn't even let my dad joke around with us as kids because ""Any form of lie is a sin""

 Once when I was young, I told her something and my brother lied to save his butt, she believed him and responded by punching me... In the mouth... And yelling at me. I still remember being confused as to why the person I loved and trusted to protect me had suddenly hit me for telling her the truth.

 A few years later, when I was about 12 I think, I was joking with my uncle about being excited to head home after visiting him and my aunt with my mother for the week, saying ""anywhere is better than here""

 She got angry

 She yelled and smacked me and threatened to leave me behind and made me pull my suitcase out of the car and drag it back into the house, I remember crying and looking to my aunt and uncle for help to see them acting like it wasn't even happening.

 There was another time when my brother and I were play fighting/arguing and she got mad at us. This one is probably the worst of all the incidents thus far... This was the first time she had actually hit us more than once. She knocked us off our beds, hit us, slammed us into the ground, and I think I may have hit the ceiling at some point but I think my brain blacked some of it out for me (we were living in a small 3 bedroom camper at the time and it didn't have much headspace).

 She once FORCED me to shower in front of her because she got mad at me for having oily hair and thought that I, in middle/highschool at this point, didn't know how to wash my hair properly. It didn't help that the shower curtain we had was completely see thru

 That's just some of the more physical or more memorable moments, she would also try to get my dad thrown in prison for false reports of abuse, rape, drugs, etc. Would use the Bible to scold us if we did something wrong and then use it again to defend herself for doing the exact same thing.  Cheated on my dad for years with multiple men, and even had my dad convinced that there is a possibility that I might not be his daughter at one point, which was soul crushing for both of us. We're still too scared to get DNA tested.

 There's a lot more things that she has done and long story short she now has a bf and has me terrified that if I so much as breathe wrong in her direction that she's fully willing to kill herself because she knows that I would never be able to live it down.

 There's more but I don't want everyone to think that I'm just being a bully and too mean to my mom, there have been good moments in our lives but I feel that the bad outweighs the good by a lot, and I probably shouldn't be complaining over something so small especially when a lot of people out there have it much worse than just a few incidents.

 Am I just being insensitive and reading way too far into her actions? 

(If this post should be somewhere else then plz let me know and I'll take it somewhere else) P.S.

I was definitely a child and I know I was emotionally/physically abused by my mother as a solid fact from what I have experienced my whole life but I don't have any childhood memories, I think my earliest proper memory is maybe from when I'm 10? But I've started piecing things together and I'm freaking out and I feel like I have no one to talk to because I can't explain it properly but all I know is I hurt and I couldn't stand to be touched until I was like 20 years old and that's not normal.",throwawayblah00000,2020-03-15 12:40:14,7,203,13.4,1.94,99,5.11,22.56,18.23,91.63,59.11,19.7,14.29,14.29,0,0,0,0,5.42,1.97,12.32,12.32,4.93,9.36,4.43,19.7,2.96,2.96,1.97,1.97,2.46,3.94,0.99,2.96,0,1.48,0.49,4.93,0.49,0,0.49,0,19.7,6.9,1.48,1.48,3.45,2.96,6.4,3.45,0,0.49,2.46,1.48,0.49,0.99,0,0,4.93,0.99,1.48,1.97,0.99,0,4.93,16.75,0,10.34,0.49,3.94,6.4,0.99,0.49,0,0,0,0,0.99,0.49,0.49,0,0,0,17.24,2.96,2.96,0,0.49,2.46,0.49,0,0,5.91,0.99,0.99
fj782p,Emotional/Verbal/Psychological Abuse vs. Physical/Sexual Abuse as seen by others,"Please forgive me if this has been brought up before. I am still trying to navigate my way around Reddit and am having troubles searching, etc.

So, the reason I am posting: Has anyone else had people take your abusive situation less seriously if it is mental as opposed to physical? 

My father is verbally/mentally abusive (he has been physical as well, but it's been years) and I was venting to a friend about it yesterday. She tried her best with a reply saying that it's not good and he has issues. Kinda stating the obvious, but yes, it isn't good and he does have issues. Then, she never said anything again. I started to wonder about what if I had told her he was physically hurting me. I bet anything that her response wouldn't just be ""he has issues"". I should also mention that we are adults in our early 40's. She has also been a victim of mental and physical abuse. Maybe it's me and my anger at the world for not caring. My mom just died three weeks ago and I received some condolences on social media, but other than that, and my aforementioned friend helping me, no one called or visited or anything. I mean, I was definitely jaded before my mom passing, but having my father go off on me for asking why he never once inquired how I'm handling my mom's death, while I have focused my energy solely on him, was the last straw. I could go into the whole history of my father, but it's not really the point. As long as he's alive, this will happen. I honestly felt like my head was being punched every time he opens his mouth. He's literally punched my head before, so I'm not speculating. It feels physical to me with the anxiety, depression, etc. Sadly, it's just him and I with no other close family, so we are all we have. He doesn't live with me (yet), but as the only one, I feel it's my duty as a daughter to take him in. This would kill any spirit left in me by getting abused on a daily basis.

Back to the topic! Just why don't people see it the same? It reminds me of my mental illnesses and people not really caring or caring enough to understand. If I had a more tangible, visible condition, it would be recognized. I've had it happen before. Like, if they can't see it, it's easier to dismiss.

It feels so lonely and makes you question your own perception of what is abuse when others don't validate it (if that makes sense) when you reach out.

I know I'm not alone in this, but I think it might make me feel a bit better if others shared their experience or opinion on if the different types are treated differently by those around them.

fj92r5,My ex sent me roses.,"So I know that doesn't really sound all that bad but honestly it's the most horrible thing he's managed to do to me in a while and just when I was starting to feel better it has really derailed my recovery.

My ex was seriously abusive. He didn't actually hit me most of the time but I have honestly never, ever, encountered anyone in my whole life with the same capacity for cruelty and evil. I've never met someone who could be violent just with words, someone who could make you feel like you've done ten rounds with Mike Tyson just with their voice.  This man destroyed my whole life. Destroyed me. If there were mind game championships and this guy entered, the rest of the contestants might as well just forfeit because he'd win hands down. 

Last year on my birthday he took me away to a nice hotel, this was supposed to be a grand gesture that made up for all the horrible stuff he'd put me through and was all entirely his idea. I shouldn't have been taken in but here we are. Anyway, the night actually went really well to begin with, we had dinner and drinks and went back to our room where we got into bed and began having sex. Nice. Suddenly he just changes, in the middle of sex, he turns on me and starts accusing me of faking my orgasms. This in itself is honestly pretty terrifying. Thankfully he gets off me and I can get up and get dressed but he won't let me leave, he keeps threatening me with all the things he'll supposedly do if I go. He says he'll kick me in the ass as I go if I walk out the door, that he'll go and '**** the first thing he finds'. He says he'll 'end' me right here right now. He screams all kinds of horrible sexual stuff at me that the people in adjacent rooms can probably hear. Including accusing me of wanting to join in with the couple next door who we could hear doing their thing when we arrived. Calling me a sl*t. Saying I use sex as a front. Abject humiliation. 
This goes on for some time, and he gets angrier and angrier. He's a type 1 diabetic and in the end he's wielding an insulin needle and towering over me, berating me so relentlessly I can't even respond, every time I try to pass him he pushes me back. Eventually someone hears the noise and bangs on the door, this gives me the courage to shout for help and staff come and unlock the door and I manage to get out. I try to calm myself down, order a taxi and go home. He gets in the car (which isn't even his but his mother's mobility car on which he is a named driver) having consumed two half bottles of Buckfast (THE most revolting alcoholic drink known to man) and countless whiskey and cokes, smashes up the car because he's too busy sending me abusive texts and is, quite frankly, incredibly lucky to be able to walk away relatively unscathed. To this day he maintains that this was my fault. I made him crash the car I wasn't in. Somehow he manages to turn the whole thing into a big pity party for him and has everyone's sympathy for how depressed he must be to hit rock bottom like that. He uses his diabetes as an excuse to behave however he likes and blames it on the mood swings from his blood sugar. I get that is a part of having diabetes but it is not a license to abuse people. He thinks it is. So this whole diabetes thing gets added to the mix and everyone's so sorry that he's struggling so much with it and his mental health is so poorly affected. Meanwhile I'm severely traumatised by this whole incident and nobody cares. I'm the bad guy. That was my 30th birthday. I'll remember that forever. I didn't do anything wrong. 

My brother died 10 days before my 18th. On my 21st I lived in a women's refuge because I'd just escaped a violent partner. That's just another milestone birthday I didn't get to enjoy like a normal person. Maybe that's selfish but I'd looked forward to being able to actually enjoy that. I just want to be able to experience  normality. Happiness. I want to be able to be excited about something just for me, just once. 

Anyway, there's so so much more and it's so much more complicated but I had to change all my contact details to get this guy to just leave me alone. I tried everything and basically discovered that for all the 'don't suffer abuse in silence' junk that gets thrown around, basically unless you want to pay a fancy expensive counsellor, nobody gives a single **** and will probably even blame you for what you've been through and nobody will help you, the law will sneer in your face and the NHS will send you out in the cold. 

He manipulates everyone and has turned so many people against me. Lied about me. Slandered me. Humiliated me. Still won't stop lying about me. 

I never did this man wrong. I loved him with every ounce of my soul. I gave him warmth and kindness and love and patience. I just wanted him to love me back. 

Every day of my life is pain now. I am devastated. I have tried everything to avoid him. But he completely ruined me financially and I can't afford to move house so he still knows where I live and he had the nerve to send me these dozen red ******* roses for my birthday. And I just feel like it's the nastiest, most hateful gesture. It says so many things. It says remember last year. It says remember all I took from you. It says look at me now, I can afford to throw away money on evil floral arrangements and you can barely afford to eat. Because of me. It's an acknowledgement of how painful my birthday is already and how painful that memory is and how it will always taint the one day that's supposed to be mine. It's a knife to cut open my stitches. It is a bouquet of **** yous.

I took a video of him that night, in the hotel and I just keep watching it over and over and over and over and over. Nobody else has seen it. I'm sick of him pretending to be the good guy. I wish I could show it to everyone but the worst thing about that is, that if I post that video, I'll be the asshole in that situation because society is completely ***,ed and 'social media isnt the place'. Yet I have absolutely no platform to defend myself, I still have to live in the shadow of this person's evil and lies and that's apparently perfectly acceptable. I just wish people would see him for what he is.",dontsendmeroses,2020-03-15 14:38:36,13,1190,23.26,47.65,51.18,4.48,15.66,14.37,93.95,60.59,22.1,14.37,8.74,0.5,0.84,4.12,0.17,7.73,5.21,12.61,9.41,7.65,7.98,1.85,19.33,3.95,1.85,1.26,0.84,2.86,7.39,2.61,4.71,0.76,1.85,0.59,11.68,0.17,0.59,0.17,5.13,11.68,1.51,1.51,1.51,2.52,2.52,2.86,3.11,0.84,1.34,0.76,3.19,0.59,1.43,0.42,0.67,7.65,1.6,1.18,2.69,1.93,0.92,4.71,11.76,1.43,13.7,3.28,6.05,4.62,0.84,0.92,0.76,0.42,0.08,0.08,0.76,0.17,0,0.08,0.17,0.17,15.97,6.39,2.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.71,0.34,1.93

I’m 16 and in DE, My dad has been emotionally and psychologically abusing me for as long as I can remember, but i feel like it won’t be taken seriously because it’s not physical. I was severely abused by my mother when I was younger and the damage she has done to me doesn’t even compare to how badly my father has fucked my mental state up. I’ve tried for years to figure out a solution to this, but it always feels hopeless. I can’t move out because I don’t have anywhere to go. I live with my dad and grandmother and she owns the house but i don’t believe she can kick him out because she doesn’t have custody over me and custody charges cost too much from what i’ve seen. he’s extremely neglectful of my mental health and i’ve openly talked about self harm and suicide to him and he still won’t take me to a therapist or psychiatrist, I can’t be hospitalized for suicidal thoughts because of the costs. I don’t know what to do, just today he got mad over something he was building outside and started breaking things in the house and threw a metal mug at our cat so hard it left a dent and has been screaming at me all day and blaming everything on me. i’ve told him way too many times that yelling is my biggest trigger due to PTSD from the trauma i developed as a kid while being abused by my mom and having to go through many disturbing things, and he knows this and will use it against me whenever he feels like it. I need to get out of this situation, i’ve felt suicidal because of it for too long. he’s done a range of horrible things, abused my animals, broken my belongings, stole and sold my money and belongings and still continues to. he’s stolen well over 2k in money and belongings from me. if there’s anything at all i can do please tell me, everything is feeling worthless anymore. i can’t just keep waiting it out until i turn 18, my mental health only ever declines and i can’t get better, every time i start to get better he ruins it.",snailcatz,2020-03-15 17:04:24,2,397,14.9,16.29,78.3,1,26.47,16.12,93.95,62.97,22.17,15.87,11.59,0.25,0,4.03,0,6.3,2.77,14.61,11.84,5.29,10.08,3.53,21.41,4.03,2.52,1.76,0.5,1.51,6.8,1.26,5.54,0.5,2.27,1.01,8.31,1.76,0,1.76,4.03,11.84,3.27,2.27,0.5,1.76,2.02,3.02,2.52,0.5,0.5,1.51,1.76,0,1.51,0.25,0,6.55,1.26,1.26,2.27,2.52,0,5.29,15.87,0.76,12.34,1.26,6.05,5.04,0.5,0,0.5,1.26,0,0.76,0.5,0.25,0,0,0.25,0,13.35,3.53,3.53,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,6.05,0,0
fjbqw0,I think I have a toxic mother. Please give me advise.,"I'm really not sure what I can do at this point. Since the ninth grade I've self harmed in several different ways and only recently have I stopped. I'm trying very hard to stay happy and to find things that make me feel good but there is one HUGE problem. My family, mainly my mother, is very toxic. I've tried to blame all of my problems on past friendships but the problems only arise when I'm at home and around my mother. I used to think ""if my mom wasn't here then my dad would probably be super abusive."" But as I've gotten older some things have come to light and I've realized that my mother has been very physically and mentally abusive to me my whole life. My dad has tried his best to protect me. I'm turning nineteen soon and I'd love to move out because at this point I think it's the only thing that will help but I'm scared. The other day my mom said to me that living on my own isn't an option for at least the next ten years and that I'll always have to rely on her for everything. Of course I know that a child should be able to rely on their mother for anything but the fact that she said always and for everything kinda made me feel horrible. I know I would do better on my own and I know she's not always right when she says she knows what's best for me but it really hurt to know that she doesn't have any faith in me.

fjd0h3,Desperate cry for help...,"Sorry for the very long post I just needed to vent...


This might sound pathetic but I literally have no friends/family/anybody I know that lives in the area that I'm currently living in. My problem starts where the it says ""my issue"". But honestly to get the full picture of how tragic my life feels right now read the background.


Some background...


I'm in my late twenties and grew up I  a military family so I have never lived long in on location.  At the age of 18 I left for the military myself but that's when my life changed for the worse. I was abused by my sqaud members almost daily. The abuse started as general new guy hazing stuff like making my run around looking for imaginary things or orders  etc. But things started to ramp up quickly being that I was the smallest and the youngest. It started with very hurtful verbal abuse (calling me racist names, calling me worthless/a retard for asking questions etc) from people my own rank all the way up to the my warrant officer. Soon verbal turn physical and yes sexual. I wasn't raped but I will not relive those memories for this post neither. Things carried on like that for what seemed like an eternity, i pretty much was forced out only 2 years into my dream of a long military career after 3 failed suicide attempts and an alcohol incident.


When I first came back I had a horrible time readjusting back to my former life. I was literally 100 pounds over weight (and the weight that I was when I entered boot camp at). I was back living with my parents which felt embarrassing and and overkill already to my already low sense of worth. I tried so reach out to everyone that I could to try to hang out with or talk but thi is always felt awkward  or in some cases I would be thirstier than a dying guy baking in the desert for months and immediately ruin the conversation and any chance of friendship.  I was so desperate for a normal sense of a relationship I fell quickly into a very toxic relationship ( I was a major contributor to the toxicity along with her some of her actions) 2 years later she ended up leaving me and i don't blame her one bit. I was extremely clingy and jealous. Since I was not treating any of my symptoms of depression and anxiety I would have days where I would literally sleep all day even at her place.... which was another thing....


When I first came back I had a horrible habit of never sleeping at night because again I was not treating my PTSD  or sleeping for days like a bear in hibernation. So when I was dating her I was always at her place. On my fridays I would pack some things in a backpack and no joke as if I was a kid going to sleep over his friend's house on the weekends. I would go to her place and sleep over then go back to my parents place as I worked and continue the cycle. I would have mental breakdowns at home too. I would have night terrors and periods where I would cut/burn myself leaving a couple of horrible scars on my chest/shoulder and forehead. 


Anyways things got a little better after I went on an absolute social purge and deleted my facebook and stopped replying to the little people who texted me. I left that job and actually started to address my severe depression and anxiety along with my weight issue as well. I went to the doctors and college. I tried to amend my very damaged relationship I had with my parents and sister. I sought the right treatment which lead me to a 6 year recovery period where I lost  60 pounds and try to practice healthy habits. I quit drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. I now wake up to ride my stationary bike for 2-3 hours a day or go for very long walks. I currently work full time at a job that I actually enjoy. I even have my own unit in a apartment building but the only hang up is that I have an extremely hard time meeting new people or even talking to people


It feels like I have all these skills to maintain myself so I avoid those cycles of depression and suicidal thoughts but gained no social skills at all. I freeze up and all those self defeating and self doubtfulness/loathing thoughts come washing over my like a tsunami. Therefore I tend to avoid crowds and gatherings.

The issue:

 My problem is that I feel like a stranger in a town I literally spent the most amount of my life in.  I have no friends at all and the loneliness has been fueling my recent growing depression. I feel as if years of work is slowly unraveling itself. I've tried apps (pof tinder etc) and what not but honestly I was quickly discouraged when I literally had no replies other than bots and escorts. I'm left a sense of hopelessness even at someone somewhat young. I feel like my twenties has been a waste and trying to be the lone wolf in life is turning out to be something I don't want. I just want to find genuine people to hang out with and talk to. I have no idea where to start. I could really use some help rebuilding a social life and honestly find someone special... 


Again sorry if the post is too long or whatever I just really needed to vent. Maybe my expectations are too much for myself and I should be satisfied with just being here at the present moment but the loneliness really is starting to a sink hole that I'm finding it to be harder and harder to climb out of...

fjdrr9,Please.. how do I help my friend?,"Hi. I hope my age isn’t an issue, but I’m going to clarify now that I, and the friend I am discussing are teenagers. I’m not going to give any further damning points, but I feel it may be important 59 clarify.

Now I really need some help knowing what to do. This may be a pretty long post because I’ve never wanted on this before. 

I’ve known my best friend for a good amount of years now. We’ve had our ups and downs, but we always remain close. Now it’s been no secret between our friendship group that his home life isn’t particularly great. He works a lot to be able to provide for himself and his little siblings despite living what appears as an outsider a very lavish lifestyle. He has a large house in a decent neighbourhood, his father is a businessman, they take a lot of trips around the world. However, we all knew things were up to an extent. His mother left a few years back, probably about 3 or 4, to move back to her home country. And from there things got progressively worst. At first it was small things none of us really noticed. I remember watching a video of our friend group hanging out and messing around that we had taken. It was a great laugh and memory to look back on. But when I looked in on my friend, who I’m going to call ‘A’ for the remainder of my story, I noticed some odd things.

First, his tendency to flinch in videos. When the girl stood next to him in that video lifted her hand to move her hair out of her face, he flinched away from her, and his face for a moment looked one of pure terror. I was definitely baffled but kind of brushed over it (stupid of me to do, I know). And we carried on with out lives.

That was until more things would happen. Before this point, he would always wear the same thing. A plain white shirt and basketball shorts were his go to outfit. But as time went on, I noticed he was covering up more and more. Shirts swapped to hoodies and shorts swapped to jeans, even in the hottest of weathers. But again, I failed to pick up on any sign.

Now bare in mind, these small things were happening for years, and none of us really got it, given our age at the time. He might come in one day with a bruise on his face, but he would explain it away as he got into a fight with his little brother, or he tripped on something or other, and we would all just nod along and move on.

That was until the one event that changed EVERYTHING. I remember the day so clearly and I will never forget a word of what happened. At the time, we were voice chatting with each other, and he was at his aunt’s house, he seemed super stoked and happy, I could almost hear his smile in his voice. I heard another voice in the background and he told me he’d just be a minute and that he had to ‘help his dad bring his work laptop in’, and so he put his phone that I was on in his pocket and went on. I waited and waited until I heard a pretty loud thud, followed by A swearing over and over again under his breathe, clearly panicking. I muted myself, because I wanted to listen without interrupting. He carried on for a while and went inside. When he went inside, I heard him apologising over and over, whilst another voice berated him, called him names, swore at him etc. The next thing I heard was the worst. I heard the shattering of glass and then everything went pretty silent for a bit. I waited again, and next I new he was back on the phone, sounding panicked and rushed. He told me that he thought had glass in his eye, that he felt like his eye was bleeding and that he couldn’t see properly. I urged him to call an ambulance and he promised he would go to the hospital the next day.

I found out, a few months later, that what had happened that day was that whilst carrying the laptop in, he had tripped up on his laces and smashed the front screen. When he tried to apologise, his dad threw the closest thing near him at him, which happened to be a glass cup. It smashed against something, either his jaw or the counter beside him, I can never quite remember, and glass shards hit his eye. After the call had ended, his dad had hit him in the eye, causing the embed of glass to only go further into his eye. Since that point, he’s had what he calls his ‘bad eye’, that he struggles to see clearly out of.

The next major event was one that I remember even more so. By this point, we all knew what was up. I don’t live in the same city as A, so I only met up with him in person on occasion, but from his school friends, I heard that he’d frequently come in with no injuries, mainly on his chest, arms and legs, places that he could easily hide with his uniform, that they would more during PE.

One day, I got a call from his phone, in our groupchat from A. I answered it, but it wasn’t him that answered. It was a little girl that I knew all to well, his little sister. My other friend was also on the call at the time. A’s little sister was definitely crying, but it sounded like she was trying her best to stifle it, and you could just hear loads of yelling and banging etc throughout the area around her. We asked her what was wrong, and she said that she was ‘scared very very scared’. Once again, we tried to ask her what exactly what happening, when there was this ‘smash’ sound and she got absolutely hysterical. We were trying our best to figure out what was happening, but it was near impossible with our only spectator being a little girl that’s sobbing too hard to speak. Eventually, she passed through it enough to explain. Her dad was yelling at her and threatening her, so A went down to defend her, which is when her dad followed through on his threats. In their living room, there was a large glass table, and she said that he had hit A’s head against it over and over again until part of it at the edge shattered in. We asked her what was happening now and she said that her dad was pacing worried and that A wasn’t moving. My friend left the call to call police whilst I stayed with his little sister to make sure she didn’t put herself in any harm’s way. Police did come, but, and to God’s name if I knew how, he talked himself out of it pretty successfully. Following this, A was comatose for quite a while. I would visit him in hospital a lot, just hoping he would wake up again, but I was so scared he never would again. Everyday felt like a drag knowing he wasn’t alright. He did eventually wake up, and didn’t suffer too badly, though he has difficulty memorising things, and struggles to put names to faces, or objects, as well as having completely screwed up peripheral vision.

We’ve implored him to call police, it’s not super easy to do it city over city here, but we’ve done it for him too lots of times. Sometimes his suffering wasn’t physical, and it was more emotionally torturous. He would humiliate A, doing things like forcing him to wear a shock collar and bark like a dog whilst recording it, just honestly sick and vile things like that.

Recently, our plans worked out. There was a court hearing in which his dad was sentenced under courses of child endangerment and abuse, as well as perverting the course of justice and other things. However, my friend is still horribly off. He doesn’t sleep until ridiculous times in the morning due to nightmares. He’s scared around people that slightly resemble his dad, which is difficult because his dad has a very standard look (tall brunette bearded man with brown eyes and a medium build, it’s pretty hard to avoid). He’s a lot more violent and aggressive, he’s quick to anger and hard to calm down again.

I know it’s not his fault and he can’t help it, but I just don’t know what I can do for him. What can I do to make things better for him. Please help. I’ve never been in this type of situation before.",throwawayacc151546,2020-03-15 19:49:15,1,1495,37.65,82.38,28.5,15.43,18.01,12.17,93.24,61.2,21.74,14.58,4.21,1.61,0.07,8.49,0.2,7.16,5.35,15.05,8.49,5.95,7.83,1.74,18.46,4.95,2.68,1.74,0.74,2.34,5.55,2.41,3.14,1,1.14,0.33,16.99,1.14,0.74,2.21,7.63,11.37,2.21,0.74,1.47,2.61,1.74,3.28,4.01,1.4,1.94,0.6,2.61,1.81,0.8,0.13,0,8.76,3.28,1.27,3.48,1,0.87,8.9,6.22,0.87,17.86,2.54,8.96,6.62,0.94,0.47,0.4,0.07,0.07,0,0.47,0.13,0,0.13,0.2,0,15.65,5.55,6.56,0,0,0.07,0,0,0.33,2.88,0.27,0
fje9mt,God here goes I just need to rant,"I feel so so gross writing about this but I just need to rant somewhere and none of my friends will listen without calling me a whole slew of names.

So I’m currently 14(m)
and I know that’s probably pretty young but do hear me out. I’ve never spoken to no one about this properly and I still am just so confused and scared and such. 

Alright so basically a few months back in about May I think, I went to this party. I’m not really a party person, but my friends were going and I didn’t want to be the only loser in my friendship group that didn’t go so I decided to just go for it. See I’m epileptic, and I get fits triggered by a few things. Drinking alcohol, flashing lights and extremely high emotion. It’s kind of well known that I’m a severe epileptic in my school, so the point that people will come up to me and switch their phone lights on and off to see if they can get me to throw a fit because they find it funny. Point is I was determined to not drink anything at this party, though I knew full well there would be a lot of alcohol since it’s a teenage party yknow. I wasn’t having a very good time but my friends were drinking and flirting with a bunch of girls that i didn’t really care for. It was really hot and stuffy, so I decided to step outside to the back for a bit. And that’s probably the biggest regret of my life so far. Everything from here is a bit of a blur. The next thing I remembered was a girl who came up to me. She had really long fingernails and her hair was blonde, I remember it well. And she was talking slightly slurred, like she was pretty damn drunk. She was talking to me for a bit, which is weird because I’m like the last person to have a girl talk to me. I’m short, not particularly attractive and a lot of people think based on how I dress, that I’m gay, so it was sure weird. But honestly I was kinda liking the attention. I remember she was taller than me, she was wearing heels. I was stood against a tree. She stood out in front of me and grabbed held of my face at either side and just shoved her tongue right now my throat. I was confused, worried and I hated it, so I tried my best to push out, but I’m not a very strong person physically. I couldn’t get her off me so I just stood there and took it, I didn’t know what else to do. I figured if I just let her do whatever she was doing, she’s go away, she was clearly drunk anyway. She pulled away from a bit to greet these two other girls that had come in. When they came up? She was still kind of holding my arm to the tree front. I felt a bit stupid just standing there and I was desperately trying to wriggle free from here but to no avail.

I don’t wanna go much into detail because recounting it makes me so uncomfortable, but just know when there’s three pretty tall girls against one short and weak guy, it’s not exactly hard for them to get me down to the ground. They did multiple things whilst I was trying hard to get out. One girl never properly touched me, she stood on my hand so that I couldn’t do anything. The other one held my chest down and kept spitting in my mouth and onto my face which was honestly just more disgusting that anything. And the final one was the one that was on me, doing god knows what array of sex acts. Obviously I can remember it, it just makes me feel gross saying it, I always feel sick when I recount it. After a bit I stopped fighting and just let them do what they wanted, hoping they’d get up and leave, and they did eventually. I stood up and god dressed again, kinda a mess and I went in to try and find my friends. I couldn’t anywhere, and I was just in a state. I felt gross sure but I also felt weak and stupid. Like how would I have let that happen. After some time, I went home. Two days later was school, and I figured I’d tell my friends in hopes of them knowing who they are. When I told them about what happened, initial replies were just congratulating me. ‘Wow __ got laid before I did?’ ‘How was ___ about sex’. After a bit they got it but their attitudes shifted the total other way. They were calling me gay, telling me I was a pussy for not being able to get a girl off me. So I vowed not to tell anyone else after that. I’ve developed an irrational fear of false nails and saliva and I’m still just so conflicted about what I’m meant to feel. I feel sick and ashamed that I couldn’t defend myself. I feel such a sense of self hatred that I can’t even defend myself from these girls and sex. I don’t know what to do, i feel so gross.",anomval,2020-03-15 20:25:13,4,905,12.24,15.46,88.41,17.71,17.08,11.49,95.8,62.87,22.1,15.47,11.82,0,0,1.88,1.77,6.52,4.64,11.93,10.61,9.5,8.84,2.76,21.77,5.19,1.66,1.99,1.1,2.32,6.63,2.98,3.54,0.99,0.66,0.22,9.06,0,0.66,2.76,0.11,15.03,3.76,1.22,1.77,3.2,1.33,4.42,3.31,0.55,0.55,1.88,3.54,1.55,0.88,0.66,0.77,5.64,1.33,0.88,2.1,1.33,0.33,8.4,9.83,0.77,11.82,2.1,6.19,3.76,0.44,1.33,0.11,0.11,0.33,0,1.22,0.22,0.22,0.11,0.33,0.22,14.48,5.52,3.87,0,0,0.22,0,0,0.22,3.87,0.22,0.55
fjetjp,My mother has PTSD and she used it as an out for abusing me.,"The abuse first started (or at least this is where I first noticed it the most) was when I had a panic attack in 2018, in the moment I had an extreme wave of social anxiety when she asked me to deliver something to a neighbor for her and I just couldn't, I broke down and had a panic attack out of the blue on our living room couch it was so bad I couldn't breath and couldn't feel my face and hands, she was screaming at me telling me over and over to get up and that she was teaching me to socialize going on to say if I didn't do what she wanted she would call the cops because she didn't want someone so disobedient in her house. This instance came to a close with her saying her PTSD made her act like that and that she was only saying all that to ""make you realize how much worse things could be"".

In this moment you would think the logical option would be to drop the subject and work on calming me down and trying to figure out what's going on in the moment but as you can see that isn't what she did.

So from there things were relatively quite from what I can remember and that was the first time she had ever threatened to kick me out. 

Now at the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020 she's started threatening to kick me out again now that I'm 18. Her reasons for doing this are not needed. She's threatened to kick me out as of last month-ish multiple times and one of those times was over me asking her not to snatch my phone out of my hands.

The most recent was based around me ""not doing enough"" I knew I was slacking and was trying to deal with it, I have Crohn's disease and am on disability for it, I have dyslexia and dyscalculia, I'm depressed (not wanting to go anywhere or do anything including eating most the time), I'm working on graduating high school still online because my crohns and other learning disabilities put my school work on hold and put me very far behind on a track I was already behind on and she ended up blowing up at me and once again threatened me to get out, gloating about how I'd never make it on my own and how she could have travelled and been off somewhere with some guy if she hadn't had me this again ended with her ""trying"" to patch her words up by saying ""I just did it to scare you""

I'm honestly all over the place with this post and my mind is running in circles. I got hit with a wave of fear and a feeling to run away from my current home. My mom lives with me and I want this feeling to go away and I want to be able to explain why and how she hurt me but I feel like she's going to cut me off again and not let me explain if I try telling her why her actions are causing me so much pain.

She's been really agressive lately and has been fluctuating between depressed/sad and angry and I don't want to start something that'll make her come at me.

She's out with a friend and she texted me the question ""how are you doing?"" A moment ago and I responded with ""To be honest I'm having a rough moment mentally, you still with your friend?"" And I said that in a safe way as not to put her in a spot with her friend that might make her come at me but now I'm afraid to explain to her that it's her actions and etc that popped up at me and made me feel so awful and anxious. If I do that I'm afraid that we'll fight over text and then she come home to chew me out or that she'll not read what I said until she comes home and then I won't be able to explain what's wrong and she'll start yelling at me and defend herself and make it seem like she isn't at fault and that I'm in the wrong.

I don't have friends because of her smothering and over protective attitude to me when I was younger and also don't know how to do a lot of things on my own because of the same reasons.

I'm freaking out and don't know what to do.",Goatlop,2020-03-15 21:07:02,12,778,20.94,35.45,77.08,1,43.22,11.18,94.73,67.1,22.88,16.58,9.77,0.26,0.9,5.66,0,6.17,3.98,17.22,11.95,5.4,10.54,2.7,22.75,3.47,1.93,2.44,1.16,1.41,5.14,0.51,4.63,1.54,1.54,0.64,10.67,0.26,0.77,5.91,0.13,13.5,2.96,3.08,2.44,3.47,0.51,2.96,2.7,0.26,1.16,1.29,1.29,0.51,0.51,0,0.26,6.94,1.16,1.54,2.83,0.39,1.54,6.04,11.95,1.41,17.87,2.7,9,6.04,1.16,0.13,0.9,0,0,0,0.13,0.13,0,0,0,0,10.41,2.06,1.16,0,0,0.26,0,0.13,1.54,4.63,0.51,0.13
fjhs7l,Should I plan on having an FWB after I get out of the house?,"My country is an abusive situation, but the last time I fled, I made the mistakes of taking a political advocacy, and of leaving my country first, before leaving my family. Now I have sporadic hemiplegic migraines, and a fearful avoidant attachment Style. I'm here in the terrible home that I am from, sick with some sort of thing. I think I might be novel Coronavirus, but I'm hoping that it's just rhinovirus. Novel Coronavirus outbreaks are each worse than the last, and this one has effectively shut down the United States. It's as though the whole world is on general strike in protest against a small number of people eating bushmeat. I keep warning my mother, who lives with me, that if she physically attacks me or has someone physically attack me, I will do the same in return. Now I realize this going to be is, but this is an abusive situation. I mean to leave this into a non abusive situation quickly, by any means necessary, including if necessary witnessing, suffering and committing additional abuses, including against people that have committed no offense against me, and deliberately interfering with the flight of other fugitives. I realize that you cannot have a society in which people generally act this way, however I wish to put my needs ahead of the greatest good for the greatest number, all the while not assuming that others around me will resemble, nor conform to me. I will eat alone, for example.

The plan was to get a job, use the money to rent a cheap Airbnb, and then living in the cheap Airbnb in doing the job, on my off hours having an FWB as practice for a genuine relationship. I would get a sponsor license holder and an online date lined up in the other country, and then end the friendship with benefits, and go over to both in the other country on the work visa, and do both the job and the online date.

fjj2da,the thing about mental abuse for me,"we have our mind, that's a least all we think we have. and it's ours, it is only ours. the thing is that other people who are not you can damage our minds. they can make it ill and wounded. but then, when we eventually succeed to break ourselves free from those people we are left with our private and personal mind, our now injured and damaged mind. 

so for the longest time i fought myself in daily battles with my mind, because i thought - wait this mind it's only mine so everything bad that goes through it it's mine. but no, all the wounds and all the damage my mind have now it is because of someone else who has done it to it. 

i am more than my mind, my mind is just another part of me. a very central and core part of me because all i go through life is being processed in my mind, but it is not all that i am. i am also my will from the core of who i am, which is not my mind. 

right now i have a damaged mind because of an abusive ex partner. now i will try to tend to my mind realizing that it is not all of me and that this damage it is not me, it was caused by someone else to my own private and personal mind. 

i hope what i wrote can ease a bit some pain for other sufferers. i love you all and hope that we will all win this battle.",im_always,2020-03-16 03:50:54,0,269,4.58,48.51,63.36,3.89,17.93,11.15,93.31,68.03,30.48,16.73,10.78,4.83,0.74,0,0.37,13.75,4.09,9.29,12.27,5.2,7.81,2.23,16.36,3.35,1.49,2.23,0,5.58,8.18,2.6,4.83,0,1.86,0.37,11.9,0,0.37,0,0,13.75,1.12,2.23,0.74,2.23,3.35,4.83,0.37,0,0,0.37,2.6,0.37,2.23,0,0,7.81,5.58,1.12,1.12,0.74,0.37,1.86,14.87,2.6,7.06,0.74,2.23,3.72,0.74,0,0,0.37,0,0,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,10.78,5.2,3.72,0,0,0,0,0.37,0,1.49,0,0

fjld8a,why do most people who are abused not leave their partner,"This is assuming that they are abused by their partner. My mom used to be abused by my dad and she never left him. I could never understand why. When i grew up i found out that my dad is a powerful man and can have most people killed/kidnapped if he so wished so maybe that aided him but not every single person who is abused has a powerful abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

So i guess my question to you is, why don't most people who are abused leave their abuser (to my experience anyway). Sure if you want to make things work, give it a year or two but then leave if things don't work out",alixxxali,2020-03-16 06:58:27,14,128,2.52,62.28,35.37,1,18.29,7.03,96.88,60.94,22.66,14.84,7.03,0,1.56,3.12,3.12,7.81,2.34,7.03,11.72,8.59,10.16,4.69,21.09,3.12,2.34,5.47,1.56,3.91,7.03,0.78,6.25,0,6.25,0,19.53,2.34,1.56,1.56,4.69,22.66,3.12,3.91,4.69,8.59,3.12,6.25,0.78,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.47,1.56,3.12,2.34,0,0,3.91,18.75,0.78,10.16,3.12,3.12,3.91,1.56,0,0,0,0,0.78,0.78,0,0,0,0,0.78,12.5,3.91,1.56,0,1.56,0,0,0,0,1.56,1.56,2.34
fjmhut,first time i talk about this.,"I am not sure if thats the right place to talk about that...

In first time i was harassed by +25 year old man when i was 15. He had lied his age for me and he seemed so nice in internet and he asked me to meet him. I went meet him in, we walked around and we actually had good time. He took me in place where no one ever goes and i didnt think that would be dangerous.. i was so naive. There was old building and he pushed me against the wall of it and started to kiss me and grab me.. he  forced his hands under my shirt and tried to take my clothes away.. He said he wants me so much and hes going to fuck me. I tried to say no and i tried to push him away but he was so much bigger than me. When i finally had an opportunity, i hit him on face and kicked him on his knee, and he let me go. i ran away. He was so confused when he texted me in night and asked why i ran away. I blocked him and he made many accounts and tried to talk but eventually he stopped.
I didnt meet guys after that for a long time.
Another times were when i had turned 18. I went to the club first time, i was wearing a skirt and a little revealing shirt. I got grabbed from boobs so many times that night and twice some guy who tried to grind me was tryin to put his hands under my skirt. I drank tequila for first time and i was relaxing and sitting alone when my friends went dance. They werent even so far away. Tequila hit me hard and i fell ASLEEP for few minutes! I woke up when some guy was making a hickeys on my boobs. i was shocked, i slapped him and went to tell my friends and we went all together home.. Last time i drinked ever, was in party what we had at my friend's home. I knew everyone in there, so i thought i would be safe. I went earlier sleep, and i woke up when my guy friend had came in my bed and tried to touch me. 

what to do, i feel violated, even though those all things happened long time ago. i cant wear clothes that reveal more than my face and hands, i just wanna feel invisible. if you have stories of your own that you want to tell to someone or you like to talk with me it would be nice.. i am all alone with these experiences :) I wish all best for you all who has been through this.",Girlwith-brokenheart,2020-03-16 08:13:30,4,471,12.36,40.78,92.69,37.02,15.19,9.34,96.6,59.66,25.05,20.59,12.95,0.85,1.06,5.52,0.21,4.46,1.7,12.1,8.07,6.58,9.77,1.49,21.66,3.61,1.49,2.76,1.91,2.97,4.46,2.55,1.91,0.21,0.85,0.42,14.01,0,1.49,0,6.58,9.98,1.7,0.85,1.91,1.7,1.91,3.18,2.97,0.42,0.42,1.91,4.46,3.4,0,0.64,0.85,8.92,3.4,2.55,1.7,1.27,0.64,12.74,6.58,1.06,19.32,4.03,7.22,8.07,0,1.49,0.64,0.21,0,0,1.06,0.64,0.21,0,0,0,10.83,7.86,2.34,0,0,0,0.21,0,0,0.21,0,0.21
fjogcu,I don’t know how else to help my friend,"My(20m) really good friend(21f) of several years is in a severely abusive relationship. Me and her other friends have been trying to help her out for years but nothing seems to bring an end to it.
The first time we tried intervening was when he faked a suicide in her bathtub just to get her to freak the fuck out. We didn’t know this happened at the time but once we heard this we realized this guy was a straight up psychopath and there are no limits to what he he will do to our friend.
Then he started beating her and we were well aware of it for a long time but she continuously denied that it was him but we knew it really couldn’t have been anything else. Like the idiots we were we did nothing and of course things got worse.
One specific beating she did the right thing and called one of our really close friends. He picked her up and she spent the night at our place and we all agreed to go to the cops the next day. We did and in the course of that day he got arrested, he got kicked out of school, she hated us because we “betrayed” her and she wanted nothing to do with us.
Fast forward a month or so and they have a restraining order forbidding communication between them and we’ve all long since made up so everything seems good. But now they are talking again on social media. She is so “madly in love with him” that she has no IDEA of what is abuse. It seems like dictionary Stockholm syndrome because she WILL NOT leave the guy who is so clearly ruining her life. She doesn’t listen to us, she won’t seek professional help, she won’t press charges and she won’t stop talking to him. Idk what else we can do for her and I’m afraid the answer might be “nothing” because of the obvious implications of that answer.

fjosgm,TW/ child sexual abuse by father ans physical violence by my brother,"The title makes it sound very broken, and very sudden, when ur was very slow and a part of my life till I was 13/14. My brother loved me as a kid, he's 26 right now, im 19, we've 7 years between us. He spent a lot of time with me and we'd have fun, but it grew to him beating me up with a belt, sometimes a duster with a thick wooden handle, verbal abuse, him being in denial right after and exhibiting classic perpetrator traits by giving me extra love, bringing me ice cream etc, started when I was like 8, the details are quite blurry but he'd definitely do everything in his power to make me feel bad. I'd go running to dad, and he won't do it infront of him, because he'd be scared of him, since my father had beaten him up like a handful times. He's never done that to me, but he has touched me inappropriately two times, very spaced out and would feel incredibly guilty and go back and pretend things didn't happen at all, I was too young to realise that then. Once I think when I was 9/10 and then when I was 11/12, it did involve him getting on top of me and kissing me and trying to play with my breasts, that did happen. He died when I was 14, an year or two after that I realised what had happened, I put up a pretence and started trying to project this perfect life, and it worked on everyone I'm really close friends with ar this point, but they don't know ANYTHING, I've a breakdown every once two months caused by anything triggering, I really want to get better, could someone please tell me where to start....",garimazy,2020-03-16 10:33:04,3,314,22.5,47.45,72.13,37.02,39.25,13.06,89.49,57.96,21.66,15.92,9.55,0.96,0.32,4.78,0.32,5.73,3.82,12.74,10.83,5.41,8.92,1.27,19.75,5.1,2.23,2.23,5.1,1.59,5.73,3.18,2.55,0.64,0.96,0,11.46,1.59,0.32,0,6.37,12.1,1.59,1.91,0.96,3.18,2.23,2.55,1.91,0,0.32,1.59,2.55,0.32,0.96,0.64,0.32,8.28,2.87,1.91,2.87,1.27,0.32,6.69,8.92,0.96,16.56,2.23,5.73,9.24,0.64,1.27,0,0.32,0,0.32,0.32,0,0.32,0,0,0,16.88,3.18,8.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.82,0,1.27
fjpcti,Is this abuse? I've never really been sure...,"When I was nine, I started to have pretty awful back issues. We just figured it was because I was a bit of a gamer so I kind of slouched, but I wasn't a hunch back or anything. It was a good old case of parents saying ""video games are bad."" My dad didn’t care all that much, he’s retired military and has a bad back and knee, and he often plays Diablo or just sits and watches TV, so he’s like a small-time gamer, and has a little slouch of his own. So, when my back issues started to affect me to the point I was having trouble sleeping, and I had issues picking up things I used to be able to pick up, my mom(goes to work, dad is disabled vet so he stays home) had him take me to Shriner’s Children’s Hospital. I was nine so I honestly didn’t pay attention to anything nor do I remember it. So, it’s been a few years, my parents divorced, grandma passed, a lot of things happened and we just forgot about it, but when I was 13 my back issues spiked up and got even worse. My mom took me to the doctor, we tried physical therapy for a while, and that ultimately made it worse to the point I would get some weird muscle-spasm in my lower back to the point I’d drop on my knees. It rarely happened, maybe 1-2 times a month. So when physical therapy didn’t work, we ended up going back to Shriner's, when I was now 14. The secretary actually told my mom that I had an appointment 6 years ago, but we never showed, and never called them back. My mom looked and found out all the contact information was my dads, and when we came home from the appointment when I was nine he told her I was fine and just needed to do some stretches. My dad knowingly ignored their calls even though they suspected that a NINE YEAR OLD had ARTHRITIS. A huge issue for someone that age. So we never went back. We saw the doctor I was supposed to see, and he said that if I came back that even though you can’t exactly cure arthritis like that, I still could’ve been better prepared for it. When I was 11, my PE teacher put me through a lot of strain because I wasn’t able to keep up with the other kids and she just passed it off as lazy and made me run more, do more push-ups, more sit-ups, all of it, the doctor said that probably made it worse(I have issues other than arthritis- but arthritis is the main one). So, I feel like my dad caused me to go through so much embarrassment and pain just because he didn’t feel like going to an appointment…",ZamBamz3,2020-03-16 11:05:31,2,494,11.93,34.26,84.64,8.73,24.7,12.15,93.72,59.31,19.64,13.97,9.31,1.62,0.2,2.23,0.61,5.67,5.47,9.31,9.31,10.73,10.12,2.43,20.04,3.64,2.83,1.62,2.23,2.83,4.66,1.62,3.04,0.4,0.2,0.2,10.32,2.63,0.2,1.42,2.83,13.36,1.62,2.23,0.81,3.24,1.82,4.45,2.43,1.21,0.61,0.61,3.44,0.81,2.83,0,0,9.31,2.63,1.42,3.04,1.21,1.21,11.94,7.69,0.61,14.78,2.83,6.07,8.1,1.82,1.21,0.4,0.2,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.4,4.25,6.28,0,0,0.2,0,1.21,0.4,3.24,0.81,0
fjq89e,Childhood Abuse Survivor turned Trauma Informed Life Coach for other Survivors of Domestic Abuse -- Free Resources,"Hello everyone! I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. I have spent my ENTIRE life learning about psychology to try to understand what happened to me, why, and the effect it has had on me and my life. I spent so much of my life trying to figure these things out and then trying to heal from the traumas. There was a long period of my life where I was just completely miserable, hopeless, angry, scared, worried, sad, hurt, depressed, anxious, and so on…  

I have since turned my life around completely. I started my first business while I was completing school for counselling. At the same time, I was still working through therapy. When I accomplished all I could through therapy, I was in a stable place. I was able to function and survive. However, I still wasn’t living the life I wanted and had no idea HOW to get it.  

This is when I hired my first Business Coach. Working with her, I learned a ton about coaching, an area I knew nothing about. After gaining some different skills through Coaching, I was able to finally pinpoint what it was that I needed after my completion of therapy left me stable, but aimless: a Coach.  

I needed a Coach who had a background in mental health work. I needed a Coach who understood what I was going through, what I had done in therapy, and what I should focus on or work towards next. Unfortunately for me, this type of Coach didn’t yet exist. Instead of this discouraging me, I decided to become this Coach instead.  

I have taken my experience previously working as a Probation Officer, my education and experience in psychology and counselling, and my experience and passion as a survivor of domestic abuse and created a Trauma Informed Life Coaching program. This program empowers survivors of any type of abuse at any point in their lives to break the negative conditioning the abuse as had on them and to create and live a life that is genuinely happy, healthy, and successful.  

I have also created a social media platform associated with my Life Coaching practice to provide as much FREE information, support, and resources as possible to any and all survivors that are interested (including a 3 day workshop about anxiety):

fjwfrd,"This is a long one I didn’t think I’d ever write, let alone post, but I just needed it to be out there I guess","One day I came home from school, I loved 7 minutes away so I walked. When I got home the first thing I did was look for my dog, as any child would. I looked everywhere, in the living room and in the rooms. My search led me to the downstairs area of the house.

In the laundry room I cried on a pile of covers on the floor, not being able to handle that my best friend had left forever and I didn’t even get to say goodbye. D came out of his room and told me to go with him.

I got up and wiped my eyes, following him to his room, blindly trusting my eldest brother. I just wanted to be comforted. 

He told me to lie down on his bed, face down, that he could make me feel better. When I got in his room the first thing I noticed was a book he had gotten from the library about sex positions. I don’t know why it caught my attention, maybe it was a warning.

I complied with his instructions and didn’t think much of it. Then he got on top of me. He was fully clothed but I felt it against my lower back. He must’ve felt me immediately tense up because his hands were on my back, stroking me. He told me that I needed to relax and that it would be okay.

It was when he went lower that something must’ve went off inside my head. 

I squirmed out from underneath him and ran for the door but he had locked it. He got in between me and the door and made me back up until I felt the bed behind me, in a panic I looked down and saw an iron man action figure my 2 year old nephew left there.

I picked it up, hit him on the head, got out the door and ran. I ran upstairs to the room my mom and I shared, where else could I have gone? 

I repressed this memory for a few years, but I do know I was always mad. I didn’t understand why, I didn’t like always arguing and having a bad attitude but there was always something that set me off. It wasn’t until I got to 7th grade and we had moved to a very small apartment that it all came back.

D and I were in the kitchen. 2 of my other older brothers were in the living room not far at all. D had said something that had set me off, I don’t remember what but I picked up a kitchen knife and pointed it at him. I was screaming, my face red, and gripping onto the knife with everything I had. He laughed, called me crazy, and walked out of the kitchen.

I was shaking when I went into the room I shared with my mom, the only room in the apartment, and sat down at the edge of the bed. I was crying in the dark because my mom was sleeping, she had to work at night. I picked up the house phone and typed in my dads number, he had told me once that he would like it if I lived with him. That if I ever wanted to get away from my brothers I could just call.

I said it all in my head, how I wanted him to take me away and how I couldn’t live there anymore. I wanted to live with him, in the city. Then I looked at my mom sleeping, I had some abandonment issues from a situation that would take a whole other post to explain, but I deleted the number, turned on the TV and crawled into bed to sleep it off. 

I still didn’t know why I had reacted that way, and I didn’t think get my answer until 5 years later. By this time D went to jail as a sex offender, I had moved to a completely different area and was a senior in high school. 

D had been in jail for a few years now, it was an out of sight out of mind type of thing. Then my sister told me about him getting out soon, my mom had been working tirelessly to get him on parole. Even then I was just uncomfortable talking or thinking about him, so I just didn’t.

Then I went to the mall with my best friend, we were sitting at the food court and talking about childhood trauma. It wasn’t an emotional talk, we were eating cheeseburgers and talking about all the shit we had gone through very nonchalantly. I won’t ever reveal what she had told me, not even anonymously, but what she said led to me telling her about what had happened to me. At the end of it I was actually surprised with myself. I had never told anyone else, I hadn’t even thought of it until that instance. She replied with what I needed to hear, a simple “damn,” and that was it.

Now that I remembered it was hard for me to live with the memory. My grades dropped, I was eating less and when I did eat it was junk, I couldn’t sleep at night so I stayed up on my phone. On top of that I had my mother constantly telling me, in joy, that D was going to get out in a few months. She had a house lined up, one that met all the restrictions, and we were all going to be together again. 

It was a month and a half before he got out, and I told my mom on February 1st at 2:45 am about what had happened to me. She apologized for not being there to protect me and told me that I never had to live with him again. Then she told me sister.

When my sister came into my room a few days later with a look of uncertainty and sympathy I knew what was going to happen. I didn’t cry when I told her, and I told her as little as possible. I was tired of crying, I didn’t want to anymore. She told me that I should’ve told her what happened because she trusted D with babysitting for her a few times. Despite that comment, we bonded over trauma that night.

After graduation I missed being with my mom and my other brothers. But D was there. I turned 18 only a month after he had gotten out and my mom begged me to live with her. My brothers wouldn’t stop asking me about what was holding me back, I could never tell them what had happened. I know they wouldn’t relate, it would only cause problems. My sister told me that I didn’t have to go, I could stay where I was for as long as I wanted but I had already been enough of a burden. So I moved in with the family I had missed so much.

Now I’ve been here about a year. In the beginning I had a lot of insane parallels to my childhood. I got so incredibly mad at D. When I was younger, and I got so mad I would cry, I would say things without thinking. I wished that D would die in jail (this was even before he did what actually landed him there, I just knew that would be bad and I wanted the worst for him). Eventually one of my other older brothers would come to get me away and cool down from the screaming match. My brother, T, sat me down and told me that I couldn’t blow up like that. That wishing death in jail on a sibling was horrible and shouldn’t be done.

T was in my room, talking to me while I was on my phone and D walked in. As soon as he stepped foot into my room I screamed at him to get out, he told me he was there to talk to T so I yelled at them both to leave. Weeks later T had a talk with me in the car, telling me that I couldn’t say horrible things like “you’re the reason I can’t see the kids here” because that could make D hurt himself and I would feel really bad.

I know that what D did wasn’t right, it wasn’t normal, and it shouldn’t have happened. But when compared to other situations of people close to me, it seems so minuscule. Like I should be grateful or happy with the fact that /only/ that happened to me because it could’ve been much worse.",myheartwent-uhoh,2020-03-16 18:18:16,3,1481,28.67,21.67,93.12,6.77,18.28,10.2,95.07,64.28,23.7,17.35,12.9,0.41,0.07,3.78,0.2,6.35,5.06,15.19,9.86,6.14,6.95,2.43,22.35,3.78,2.23,1.89,1.01,1.35,4.12,1.22,2.9,0.54,0.54,0.81,10.47,1.62,0.2,1.89,3.44,11.88,2.16,1.49,2.9,1.08,1.49,3.31,2.77,0.95,1.01,0.74,2.3,0.88,0.68,0.14,0.54,6.41,1.82,0.68,1.96,1.69,0.74,13.84,5,0.95,18.23,2.63,9.86,6.08,0.88,0.34,2.16,0,0,0.14,0.27,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,13.03,5.33,4.59,0.07,0,0.07,0,0,0.27,2.43,0.14,0.14

fjzf5v,Being forced to move back in,"Hi guys, I posted this on another sub, but I’m so desperate for advice I’m posting it again on here. 

I am a college student, I went very far away from home for college. I had a great support system of friends, I started seeing a therapist, making great friends, really enjoying classes and I also was getting help for my severe depression. 

However, due to the Coronavirus, my college has cancelled in-person classes for the remainder of the semester and kicked us out of on-campus housing. Meaning, I have been forced to move back in with my family.

I have been struggling with my mental health for years, and it wasn’t until going to college that I realized how abusive my father acted towards me. He would physically harass me over very small things when I was a young child. Usually over me not understanding math, or him just getting super angry with me. I have had bad fears of him for a while.

He eventually stopped this because I told a teacher who called child protective services. To this day, I feel bad about it. But he then went to emotional abuse and manipulation.

He would threaten to divorce my mother and make sure I knew it was all my fault. I remember one time him screaming at me in the car and telling me how I was going to do drugs and watch my family burn because all I am is a loser. He would make me feel like absolute shit over everything, then buy me expensive things and tell me how proud he is of me.

I’ve been suffering with flashbacks of memories from my childhood. I remember a lot of the things he did to me. I believe I have been traumatized.

Every time he’s in the house, I feel uneasy, and like I’m going to freak out. He doesn’t need to do anything, he can literally be joke yelling and my heart starts racing and I feel uncomfortable. I feel so upset here. 

I think the thing that really set me off is that today I asked my parents if I could take another bath. I asked permission so my parents WOULDNT get upset. I feel safest in the bath since I know my dad won’t come in the bathroom while I’m bathing. My mom said yes. But, he didn’t agree. So, he proceeded to yell at me, tell me how every time I’m home I make the water bill 100$. I just said “ok” and walked away, but I heard him talking to my mother and asking her “what has she even done today? Anything to help us?” 

It really hurts and I’m just so tired of hurting. I know the relationship between my dad and I is probably unfixable. But, I want to hear what you guys all think I should do. I’m feeling extremely hopeless, I’m stuck here for possibly five more months. I don’t have a car or car insurance (I have a license though) and I don’t have much money. With the coronavirus stuff going on, I don’t know if I can get a job.
And seeing a therapist isn’t an option since every time I ask he says “you just want one since it costs money”.

Does ANYONE have any ideas on how I should approach this? Or what I should do? Or how I can feel more comfortable in this house?

All answers are appreciated.",linkxzelda,2020-03-16 21:55:30,2,586,16.4,20.64,89.93,2.22,14.29,15.02,97.44,60.58,23.21,18.26,14.33,0.34,0.34,3.24,0,4.95,4.27,11.77,11.09,6.14,8.53,1.71,22.01,2.73,0.85,1.88,0.68,2.39,7.17,2.22,4.95,1.37,1.37,1.02,10.92,1.88,0.68,0.85,3.75,15.87,4.1,3.07,2.22,2.56,1.88,3.41,3.75,0.51,1.37,1.88,1.54,0.34,1.02,0,0.17,7.51,2.05,0.51,3.07,1.37,1.19,5.63,13.14,1.37,12.29,2.39,4.95,5.29,2.22,1.19,1.88,1.19,0,0,0.85,0.34,0,0.51,0,0,15.7,5.97,3.92,0,0,0.85,0,0.34,1.02,3.07,0.34,0.17

I’ve explained Situations to psychs as well and they just tell me to put up withit.. but I even ran away a year ago because I had enough of them and still, they didn’t get the idea through their heads.. so I have a few stories about what they do and say and well if you are knowledgeable about emotion/mental abuse/manipulation please PM me so I can tell you these and maybe get some needed advice.. thanks xx",jessiee135,2020-03-17 02:10:56,1,199,7.92,74.33,60.61,12.46,22.11,12.06,93.97,64.32,23.62,18.09,9.55,1.51,2.51,0.5,4.02,5.53,5.03,10.55,9.55,9.55,11.06,2.51,19.1,2.51,1.01,0.5,0.5,3.52,6.53,2.51,3.52,0,2.51,0.5,17.09,1.51,0,1.01,0,14.07,3.52,3.02,2.01,4.02,1.01,2.51,2.51,0.5,2.01,0,1.01,0.5,0.5,0,0,5.53,2.51,0,2.01,1.01,0,6.03,13.57,0,9.55,1.01,2.01,6.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.01,0,0,0,1.01,0,14.57,8.04,1.51,0,0,0,0,0,1.01,3.02,0,1.01
fk34xo,Have I become the problem?,"I know this is how most people who are victims of abuse feel as abusers often manipulate them into thinking they are the problem, however in my case I’m afraid it’s very possible. I’m 16 and my mother shows many signs of narcissistic personality disorder and Borderline personality disorder. When I was very young I remember her being a loving mother but as soon as I was old enough to have my own opinions and thoughts this quickly changed. She’s emotionally disconnected and closed off. She expects everyone around her to basically read her mind and if you can’t and don’t do something exactly how she expects it done she becomes livid and impossible to console if you continue to persist and do the task your way she will scream, call you names, make you feel worthless or stupid, shut you out for long periods of time, or sometimes even attempt to physically hurt you (she is not very strong so she can’t inflict much damage towards me at least not anymore but her attempts are very real) Any attempts to reason with her are absolutely impossible and she will never change her opinion on something or agree to being wrong. When she does all this to my father he reacts exactly how you expect an abuse victim to act. He does what she wants and tries to quickly change the subject or distract her so she will be happy. He refuses to believe she has any kind of mental disorder and when told that is unlikely to be the case he is defensive of her, saying things like “not everyone’s perfect” or “why do you want there to be something wrong with her”. Despite the fact that they are separated and she treats him horribly and with 0 respect. He reacts this way because she has manipulated him and he like most good noble people are susceptible. Me however I’m a completely different story. I see my mother through and through I suffer from her tactics sure but I am not swayed or much effected by her manipulation. I recognize her manipulation tactics as I’ve used them myself. I  ignore them or call them out. If ever I do what she wants to get her to stop it is completely of my own will and simply because I don’t feel like arguing at the time not because I feel inferior to her and I am almost always laughing in my head at the fact that she actually thinks that would work on me. Most times though I will do it my way and deal with whatever she throws at me. I know how to combat everything she says with something equally hurtful because I know her and her tactics so well. I even feel like sometimes I enjoy my ability to combat her and find the arguments (definitely an understatement we’ve physically fought each other, screamed at each other to the point of domestic abuse calls being made, and threatened each other’s lives) fun. Regardless of what she says to me or how much it hurts me I am always still able to come up with an equally hurtful response. I very rarely stand down and probably less often then she does at this point. Since I suffer from far less denial of my manipulative abilities I believe I often hurt her far more then she I despite her being the adult and the original abuser. I know my mother was originally my abuser and that when it started it wasn’t my fault and I wasn’t abusive at all (I was literally like 5) but over the years in my effort to protect myself and stand up for myself I fear I have become worse or equally so her abuser. I treat only my mother like this and don’t enjoy arguing or disagreeing with anyone else. I’m very level headed and don’t over react or expect people to be perfect like my mother I just know how to push her buttons and quite honestly enjoy doing so. I enjoy seeing my ability to hurt someone who seems so impenetrable and unmanageable to anyone else. I’m afraid that I’m just as bad as my mother because despite not being abusive towards anyone else while she is I feel I have become more abusive to her then she is to me or anyone.

fk3ydm,Coronavirus it's on his side,"I am a 19 year old girl living in Italy. The story it's pretty harsh but I am truly frustrated.
When I was 13 years old I got raped by a 25 year old guy. At the time I thought he was no more than 18 (that's what he told me) so I didn't denounced him. At the age of 16 talking with a friend I discovered he was in fact 25 at the time of the rape.
I denounced him, from then on things went slowly. He confirmed that he had sex with me... Still saying it was consensual. After years going on and off with this thing finally the judge decided that on March 17th there would be the sentence.
It's March 17th...i have no sentence! Everything is been postponed because of the virus...

I am sick of waiting I just want everything to end!

fk9z8r,Worried for the people stuck with abusers during quarantine.,"Someone else posted a hotline already in behalf of those people and now I wish I’d shared it. But either way I hope everyone stays safe, despite being stuck with someone who has/could hurt them. It could be a mate, parent/s, roommate, significant other, family member, etc. Whatever it may be I hope everyone is ok. I know how it feels in a way. My dad is bi polar and relies heavily on alcohol. I’m surprised he hasn’t gone running to the store to snatch up a bunch now that’s just of the many things flying off shelves. He got some the other day and mentioned there was huge line out the liquor store and a bunch of shelves were empty. All the alcoholics out there gotta stock up before it’s all over I guess. Whatever. Point is, my dad is unpredictable at best when he’s in the middle of an episode. He had an outburst a couple weeks ago. Breaking stuff, screaming, cussing, just about his problems and then pinning those problems on me. So I’m really worried. Especially since I was told not to come to work today and I’m already really worried about money. That’s one of the main things my dad likes to attack me about. I was trying to save for a concert that MIGHT, still happen in June, but A. It’ll probably be canceled and, B. Even if it doesn’t I’m really not sure I’ll have the money for it now. It’s just really stressful times and loving with somebody you never know what to expect from, makes it even harder. 

Now, even more so that people are being told to stay in their homes. With unstable people. Who could do lord knows what during the isolation. Guess all I can say is try to stay safe and if you need to call a hotline or the authorities, do so.

Not to mention all the other beatings I got for getting low marks in middle and preschool. I’ve confronted my mother about this several times (my father has long since been dead) and she’s always claimed that I’m making things up, that I’m lying. And for a while I started to believe her. Did I make it all up, was a I really that crazy, was I trying to makes excuses for my actions, did I suffer from some form of psychosis? Then I recall things she would say after my dad died when I was a teenager (a time when it wasn’t as easy for them to hit me like they used to) like, “If your daddy was alive he’d knock you on your ass.”

Nothing like a good old fashioned contradiction.

I don’t know. I’ve done a lot do dumb and fucked up shit in my life and I want to be better. But I have to acknowledge this. I don’t know if I can trust my memory so I’m getting an MRI done. Maybe then I’ll have some peace of mind, and help me solve the puzzle of why I’m so fucked up. Maybe then, I won’t have to be alone anymore.",Kakaditz,2020-03-17 11:30:21,3,333,24.45,10.38,91.22,1,13.88,9.91,93.39,63.66,21.02,16.22,12.91,0,1.2,1.5,0.6,4.8,6.01,13.81,13.81,4.5,7.81,3.3,22.82,3.6,3.3,0.9,0.6,2.4,7.81,2.1,5.71,0,3.3,0.9,9.01,1.8,0.3,1.5,2.1,17.12,3.9,2.1,1.8,3.9,2.4,4.5,1.2,0,0.3,0.6,3,0.9,1.2,0.9,0,6.01,0.3,1.2,3,2.1,0.3,8.71,11.11,2.1,11.11,0.6,4.8,6.01,0.6,0.3,0.3,0,0,0.9,2.4,2.1,0,0.3,0,0,17.72,7.81,2.7,0,0,0.6,0,0,0.6,4.8,1.2,0
fkat15,it was my fault,"I'm not going to go into details because I just don't feel okay remembering everything and I don't want to accidentally trigger someone else.

When I was 15 I had a really abusive boyfriend; he was starting with drugs and always jealous of every one around me and wanted me to isolate myself from the world so I could just be with him. Everyone that knew him told me that I should back off immediately because he wasn't so nice, he had acted really strange in the past but of course that my 15 year old self instead of listening to everyone I just tried to defend him because ""he's always been nice with me"". One day he started pressuring me into having sex with him (he was almost 17) which I told him several times I wasn't interested in that nor sure about doing so. 

I ended up agreeing one day but inside I knew that I didn't want to do so. When I arrived to his house I told him that I had changed my mind and didn't want to do have sex anymore, but he did it anyways. 

It's been two years since it happened and I never told anyone about what happened because no one could help me, I wanted to tell the police about it but Mexican police is shit and they wouldn't do anything.

I feel a bit better now because I cut him out of my life and my actual boyfriend knows about what happened and is always helping me calm down whenever I get flashbacks of what happened that day. But I still know that it was all my fault: My fault for not listening to the others, my fault for not leaving in time, my fault for saying ""yes"" at first and then change my mind.",careless_confusion,2020-03-17 11:56:03,1,309,5.23,10.95,88.34,9.74,30.9,14.24,96.44,65.7,26.54,18.12,12.94,0,0,4.85,0.32,8.41,1.94,12.94,10.68,8.09,9.06,4.21,22.01,1.62,0.32,2.27,2.91,1.29,7.12,2.91,4.21,0.32,0.97,0.32,11,0,0.65,0,5.5,18.45,2.27,2.91,2.91,1.29,3.24,5.83,1.62,0,0.97,0.65,1.62,0.32,0.65,0.65,0,5.5,0.97,0.97,1.62,0.65,1.94,11,7.44,0.65,14.89,1.94,4.53,8.74,0.97,0,0.32,0,0,0,1.29,0.32,0,0.65,0,0.32,10.36,2.91,1.62,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,1.29,3.24,0.65,0
fkec9g,TW/ child sexual abuse,"This is my first time really talking about this sober so bare with me. So I (15f) think I was sexually assaulted as a toddler I have like one clear kinda screenshot of it happening but the rest is kinda blurry. I keep doubting that it’s something that actually happened and thinking I had made it up or something but I can also remember being like six years old and thinking back on that memory of it and being confused and not understanding what happened but knowing it did. I’ve only spoken to one person about this When i was 13 and very drunk and it just kinda came out and I’ve spoken to her about it since. I also know as a child (around 8-9) when I started to realise that what happened was sexual and definitely wrong (it always felt wrong but I didn’t quite understand why) Around that Time I started to have a lot of bdsm fantasies even though I didn’t know what that was. I’m not going to go into detail but I had a lot of quite disturbing fantasies about being dominated/humiliated (that’s putting it very lightly) and I never quite understand why but now I realise it was probably connected. Honestly I still doubt my own memory and if something actually happened I don’t even know why I’m typing this or what I’m expecting I just need to put it down somewhere. I thought about talking to the one friend I told about but I just don’t want to put it on her right now.

fkf0oh,She wants me to confront her abuser,"Hi everyone. I am feeling really overwhelmed and would like some insight into a situation I have found myself in. 


My friend ""Anna"" has been best friends with ""Linda"" since they were kids. Over the last few months, Anna has slowly been realizing the abusive patterns Linda uses to control her. These include gaslighting, blame-shifting, stonewalling, aggressive behaviour, possessive behaviour, etc. I am really proud of how far Anna has come in realizing how unhealthy this relationship is.

Recently, Anna and I were discussing her relationship and how she has tried everything to get Linda to see her abusive tendencies. She said before she cuts off the relationship, she wants to try one last time to make it work and has asked me to try talking to Linda about everything I have been seeing. I want more than anything to help Anna, and I feel that I should respect her wishes and do this for her (even though I don't think it will work). 

I just wanted to reach out and ask for advice. I have been in an abusive relationship before, but I have never tried to talk to someone about their abusive tendencies. Any advice you have would be so, so appreciated.",vanessahill23,2020-03-17 16:02:31,2,212,27.68,74.56,14.39,5.57,16.31,18.87,90.57,56.6,19.34,14.15,7.55,0,0.47,5.19,0.94,5.19,2.36,13.68,12.26,6.13,6.6,0.94,24.06,4.25,2.83,1.42,0.47,1.89,6.6,2.36,4.25,0.47,3.77,0.47,16.98,0,0.94,5.19,0,17.92,3.77,3.3,3.77,2.83,1.89,2.36,2.36,0.94,0.47,0.94,0.47,0,0.47,0,0,9.43,3.77,3.77,2.36,0.94,0,5.66,15.57,1.89,9.91,1.89,3.77,4.72,0.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.62,5.66,5.19,0,0,0,0,0.47,1.89,0.47,0.94,0
fkf0tm,(21F) Am I abusive/unreasonable? Please help.,"I’m gonna keep this short as best as I can. If I am abusive, please tell me so that I can change for the better. 

Last week, my mother kept bothering me to take some vitamins because I was feeling weak and had a headache (it was due to my low blood pressure, and I haven’t taken vitamins in years). When I kept telling her I didn’t want to take any, she unplugged my phone and confiscated it. I normally wouldn’t have had a problem with it, but my phone was unlocked when she did it and I was worried that she would look through my phone. I tried to grab for my phone (I pulled on her sleeve, nowhere else) but she said she wouldn’t give it back until I took two vitamins. She said if I came any closer that she’d charge me with elder abuse. Then my dad came up and said that I should take the vitamins anyway, saying it was an intervention. I would like to point out that neither of them had done this before when I objected to taking vitamins, this was the first time they’ve acted like that. So I eventually took two, and then she said she’d give me back my phone until I took another medication. After I refused, then she gave me back my phone.

fklayt,No dinner or breakfast for 2 days until you're truly sorry...,"I'm 16 and male.
I refused to walk the family dog because I was in the middle of something else. My mom took this as a sign of disrespect and started yelling at me and insulting me, she even told me that she wishes that I was never born and that she hates me with all her heart. So I stupidly threw back a comeback for one of those lame ass insults. This set my mom off she started yelling like an ape and came up to me and spat in my face then ordered my dad to get that piece of shit out of here. I was shoved out of the room by my dad. I wasn't allowed to have breakfast or dinner until I apologized. But after the things she just said to me, I'm just not sorry. But after 2 days of only having 3 slices of bread for lunch and no dinner or breakfast I broke and went to apologize. Guess what, my apologies where not accepted. My mom said that I'm only apologizing because I'm hungry. I should come back when I mean it. I would have gone out to get my own food but corona stops me from going to the shops. I'm so hungry, I don't know what to do. My apology was sincere, as sincere as I could do. She also threatens to call the police on me for abuse even though she's the one that's starving me and yelling at me all the time for no reason other than not walking the dog..

fkmdy1,How do I (25F) deal with my shouting stepdad (60something)? Advice really needed!,"Title explains it. I will try to keep as much background info as possible, long post, TL;DR at the bottom. Obviously throwaway.

My mom and dad divorced when I was 7. I was abused by my father and went No Contact with him 8 years ago. This is no issue here.My mom started dating this man when I was 17 and living at home. This was difficult for me as I had a hard time to accept a man in the household. She was gone a lot to be with him, I started drug abuse and ended up in therapy which helped me a lot. I climbed out of the dark hole and got my life together, went to college when I was 19 and moved out.Things went ok until I was 22 and broke up with my then boyfriend, whom I was living with. I went to my mom and stepdad. Long story short, my stepdad's mom was dying, I was completely broken because my relationship ended and it was a messy situation. My stepdad exploded in my face right before his mom's funeral and forbid me to come. It was the straw that broke the camels back for me: I contemplated suicide and felt horrible. I went to the funeral which didn't help, but I called my doctor after to seek help. I left to stay with family, as i was homeless and broke. My mom sided with my stepdad and I didn't speak to them for about months. I stayed at couches while getting treatment and I found a new place to live, I figured it out by myself. I rebuilt from there and I went to a shitload of therapy which helped me a lot. My stepdad did not take the first steps to rebuild our relationship, I did. This did not feel right but I didn't want to loose contact with my mom.

Since then, he has been weird. Especially when I stay for about a week, which happens. We live in Europe, but not in the same country so when I visited I am usually staying for little over a week (think Christmas, etc.). My stepdad has gotten angry at me again, always when I was at his house. My mom and stepdad both had their own house but they spend most of the time together.At my moms house he never got angry at me, and he never shouted. When he gets angry he never wants to talk about it after, I sometimes initiated this but he never does. After the third time, I refused to initiate anything. He didn't come to me to talk about his anger or to tell me what I did wrong.

Last Christmas (2019), he was weird again but it was at my moms house. I noticed that he would make passive aggressive jokes, he would keep taking the cat away from me when I was cuddling or petting the cat (he sees the cat whole year round, I see the cat one week per year). My friend also noticed that his behaviour was off, she said if felt like he was playing a powergame. I then was upset but I initiated a talk with my mom and stepdad to talk about this. Turns out, he feels that my mom doesn't spent enough time with him when I am around. Fair enough, I ask him to take responsibility and tell me or my mom when he feels like that so we can find a solution. I ask my mom to take responsibility by letting us know when she feels the tension is rising. I took responsibility by being taking a step back when I feel strong emotions (as I learned in therapy and I ALWAYS do this) and be open to talk (like I have been many times before).

Fast forward to now and this is where I need advice. Last week I got a call that my auntie (55) was dying. She had cancer and she wanted to say goodbye to me. I packed my bag, called my work and left my study to travel to my homecountry and see her. I was devastated. One day after my arrival, all hell broke loose regarding Corona. This means I am basically trapped in my homecountry, with nothing (I had to buy extra cloths and all) and my boyfriend is where I live as well. On top of that, my mom planned to move in with my stepdad in 2 weeks. They had to speed up the process because of Corona so we moved her over the weekend. I have been helping A LOT with this: cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, driving stuff and people around, lifting stuff back and forth, etc.

On Saturday I was with my auntie for the last time, she was already passing and it was very sad to watch her in so much pain. I kept helping with moving my mom. On Monday morning, my aunt passed. I was sad but I couldn't cry for some reason. We continued with the move. I did not sleep well for days so I am exhausted. Today (Tuesday) we continued with the moving stuff and the cleaning, I did grocery shopping and organized a lot of stuff regarding boxes, etc. In the evening we went to visit my uncle and to see my aunt. The whole process is a mess because of Corona, and this is difficult.

We are advised not to touch anyone etc., so I try not to. I did comfort my grandmother when she came to me tonight, she was crying a lot and she came to me. I could not tell her to stay 2 meter away from me. I just couldn't. She didn't want to either. I finally cried and I just couldn't stop anymore basically.

When we got home (my stepdads place which is now my moms place too) finally at 10 p.m. we still had to have dinner. I fixed that with mom, stepdad came in and I put food on his plate. He then just starts shouting at me all of a sudden about how I dare to touch my grandma, that I'm selfish, that everything is always about me, that I should stop touching her and that I am critical of others touching each other. I let him shout for a bit and I didn't reply. I cried and I left the table to eat in peace at the other table. He continued shouting, even when my mom told him to stop. I went upstairs to call my boyfriend and cry. Both my mom and my stepdad have ignored me since then.

Reddit, please, how do I deal with this? I am a mess, I'm exhausted, I need sleep. I don't know if I can leave here anytime soon, I will obviously try but who knows what will be possible. My aunts funeral is on Thursday, so I will go there. I am scared my grandma might get sick, but I also cannot not touch her. I feel guilty about this. I don't know how to deal with my stepdad, he always seems to get angry no matter what I do or how much I do. It never seems to be enough. I do not know how to talk to him anymore or what to say. Please advice me on this. I need help and I'd prefer not to loose contact with my mom, we are very close.

I'm sorry this is long and all over the place, this happened last night. I am looking for advice on how to get through the funeral, how to deal with this long-term and what approach(es) to choose. 

TL;DR: Stepdad keeps getting angry, even after I talked about it with him several times and after the last time it seems to be better. After visiting my aunt who passed away yesterday and comforting my grandmother he shouted in my face about that it is always about me and that I am selfish and stupid.

fkn8b3,How to deal with abusive mom?,"Hey everyone. I'm using a throwaway account here and I really hope I'm posting this in the right subreddit.
To explain it a little bit, my mom has schizophrenia. She mentioned some changes to her meds a few weeks back and told me she was doing better. Then everything went to shit these past few weeks. 
First it strated when she said the college I want to go to doesn't exist. Most recently she accused me of using drugs because my irises were wide. Today, she hid the key of the apartment and wouldn't let me get out to pay for a delivery because she was convinced I was going out to buy drugs. 
When I threatened to get out through the window (mind you, I live on the ninth floor, though I wasn't serious), she grabbed me and started beating me. I imagine by tomorrow I'll be full of bruises, though I can't say it went only one way. 
I don't have anywhere else to go except my grandma's, but I know she couldn't take me in since she lives in a small enough place already. My dad doesn't even live in the same country and we don't talk that much at all. The closest other relative is my uncle, but I wouldn't even consider it. There's no where to run. 
I'm barely 18 and can't get a job.

fknczf,Possible sibling abuse.,"I have a number of older sisters, let's say about 5-10 years older. I vaguely remember as a child (I would guess under 8 but not sure) one or more incidents of one or more of my sister's getting me to touch them in intimate ways. I vaguely remember trying to reinitiate whatever happened, and being rejected, maybe because I was with a different sister. I think one of them also got me to touch one of their friends. I can't be any more specific as I just can't remember, and I worry also that they aren't real memories. Until about 10 years ago I didn't realise that these weren't normal experiences, and growing up I was actually kind of pleased with what had happened, not understanding that they might have fucked me up.

I was very sexually active from a very young age, and wonder if this possible experience had anything to do with that. I have also realised over the last 10 or so years (I'm in my 30s) that I have some issues in the bedroom, mostly boundary issues I guess you could call them, and an almost insatiable desire to be intimate with someone and pleasure them. I have also suffered from depression that I would guess started about the age of 8, anxiety, poor self esteem, self harming and approval seeking. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Particularly the not knowing if the memories are real. I try not to think about it too much as it fills me with anxiety, but I keep trying to understand why I do some of the things I do. I can't blame any of my sisters or ask about it either, as I don't know which ones it involved, and we are a pretty close family now, and get on well with each other.",monkeypig3412,2020-03-18 03:21:39,10,310,22.31,12.28,85.77,12.84,22.14,18.06,92.58,60,20.32,13.23,10,0.65,0.32,0,2.26,7.1,3.87,13.55,9.03,7.1,9.03,3.55,18.71,5.16,3.87,1.29,3.23,3.23,6.13,2.58,3.55,0.97,0.97,0.97,8.71,1.94,0.32,1.29,0,21.94,3.87,0.65,1.94,10,0.97,7.42,1.94,0,0.32,0.65,0.65,0,0,0.65,0,8.39,2.9,0.97,3.23,1.29,0,5.48,11.29,0.32,8.06,0.32,3.23,4.52,0,0.32,0.65,0.32,0,0,0.65,0.32,0,0,0.32,0,14.52,4.19,5.16,0,0,0.32,0,0.32,0,3.23,1.29,0

We rent the basement apartment of her parents home, but I pay and have no legal ties other than being a tenant to her mother. Her father brags about how he’s beaten my wife before and how he would do it again. He’s also gotten physical with me. He thinks he super strong but he’s a 60 year old short man so I can take him, but again not the point. When he got physical I just pushed him off me and told him to fuck off and never fucking hit my wife again. Well her mother has very bad fits and has a temper problem. She got mad over something small, and came running down the stairs (thank god we locked our door) and she banged on it screaming for 3 minutes trying to break the damn steel door down. I hope she broke her fist doing that. But again anyways, my wife has a pit bull and we have 4 cats, 3 of which are my babies. Now I don’t know where to go from here. Do I leave my wife and take my cats and move back with my parents? Or do I stick with her and hope we find something? The cops came 4 damn times tonight! It’s not safe at all and my parents won’t allow the dog at the house and my wife won’t leave without him so I really don’t know what to do. I’m terrified I have horrendous ptsd and it’s 7 am and I still haven’t slept because all of this was so traumatic. Please I need advice!

My long awaited escape, the day I finally freed myself from him. I set the date a few weeks ago when the abuse hit a new low. I woke to him raping me. I have been saving money as much I can for months, eating cheap and often not at all just to get out. And as today got closer I got more and more nervous. And last week I went and got the papers. I filled them out. I have them ready and waiting to be filed. I want him out of my house. I am seriously freaking out that last night wasn’t the last night we were in the same house under the same roof. I just want peace. I just want the screaming and hate to stop. He screams at me last night after hell at work just cuz he can. Because I don’t have it in me anymore more to do small talk. I don’t have it in me to keep pretending to care. He broke me over and over again. I was finally making steps toward making both of us happier and now... now I feel like I just wanna give up. I don’t want to keep fighting I just want this over. One more month may break me loose from reality. I finally clicked that he’s an abusive dick and I am doin everything I should and now... I failed this too... thanks for listening, I seriously had to vent and let that out. I may lose my mind here soon... oh and a nurse in an ICU setting right now isn’t important enough.

I am my patients family and friends and nurse right now because no visitors are allowed and I am giving them more than I have and I came home so far past exhausted.

Not because she wanted to correct you, but because she wanted an excuse to talk bad to you, maybe slap you a little.

fkyubp,I’m disgusted with myself.,"mentions of sexual assault &amp; pedophilia 


I was molested when I was very young (by a stranger) and physically abused for a majority of my childhood. It’s gotten to the point where affection or touch in general feels foreign and sexual (but in an uncomfortable sense) to me due to the molestation. I’m not attracted to children sexually, at all, and I know that at times someone who’s gone through pedophilic acts becomes pedophilic in the future. But the touch thing is so fucking hard for me to turn off. I feel disgusting when I pick up my baby cousin or if someone lays on me/touches me even if they’re much older. But it makes me feel so guilty and makes me feel like I’m a pedophile, even though it happens with everyone. I don’t know what to do. I avoid touching people or even being in someones space where they’d be able to touch me. I know it’s just, extreme trauma but I don’t want to not be able to have a relationship without feeling uncomfortable any time they try to hold my hand or hug me or anything. I’m sorry if this isn’t the place for this post. I just haven’t really told anyone this and its eating me up inside so much.",throwawayggggggggg33,2020-03-18 15:43:39,3,220,20.92,4.65,99,1,18.33,16.82,95.91,62.27,21.36,13.18,12.27,0,0,0,0.91,8.18,4.55,14.55,9.55,6.82,10.45,3.18,19.09,3.64,0.91,2.73,0,2.27,7.27,1.36,5.91,1.82,1.36,0.45,7.73,0.91,0,0,0,19.09,4.55,1.36,1.82,6.82,0.91,8.64,5.91,0,0,5.45,3.18,0.45,0.45,1.82,0.45,5.45,1.36,1.36,1.82,0.45,0.45,2.73,15,0.45,12.73,0.91,7.27,4.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.45,0.45,0,0,0,0,16.36,5.45,1.82,0,0.45,0,0,0,0,5.91,1.82,0.91
fl0q59,I wish I told them,"I was abused as a kid, both phisically and emotionally. I always looked down at it like if it was normal or not actually being that bad until I found out years ago that I was actually abused. Basically like I said I had an abusive family, with constant fights that I will usually get involved because I was the escapegoat of the family. My mother will also call me horrible names that still scar me to this day.

Because of this I had some serious emotional problems since I was a kid, but now I look back at how many times I could have escaped that hell and didn't... I wanna talk specially one time when I was 7 that I cried in class because I seriously thought that my parents didn't love me. My teacher noticed this and told me what was wrong. I didn't want to tell her because I didn't want to get in trouble, so I just swalowed it up. My teacher punished me by not allowing me to go play with the rest of the kids until I told her what was up (don't really know if that would have helped or not). So that last day I got into a really aggresive fight with my parents and I was thinking if I should tell her or not. In the end I just made an excuse so she could let me go play but now I regret so much. What would have happened if I told her?

So back there I was kind of conscious that my father could go to jail for what he did (even my grandma told me that I should behave because then one day my father will hit me so hard he would break my bones or even kill me and then he'll go to jail and it'll be my fault, I'm not kidding, she literally said this with this exact same words) and was obviously scared of that because then who will take care of me and my brother? (Yes, I did know adoption was an option, but I suposse that I felt guilty of taking away my brother's parents) so I never talked about it to anyone to this day, and I regret it so much.",Communism61,2020-03-18 17:43:49,2,383,3.73,9.6,89.3,1,25.53,12.27,96.08,65.54,25.85,17.75,15.4,0,0,2.09,0.26,8.09,2.87,9.92,10.97,7.83,11.23,2.87,20.63,2.61,1.04,1.83,0.78,1.31,7.05,1.31,5.74,0.78,2.09,0.78,11.75,2.87,0,2.09,1.83,17.23,2.09,2.61,4.96,3.39,1.04,6.27,1.57,0.52,0.52,0.52,0.52,0.26,0,0,0,7.57,2.09,0,2.35,1.31,1.83,9.92,6.27,2.87,11.75,1.57,3.66,6.79,0.78,1.04,0.52,0,0.26,0.26,0.78,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,10.44,3.66,2.35,0,0,0.52,0,0,0,2.35,1.57,0

fl5q7e,"On out of control situations, why you should never try to influence nor reason with anyone in such a situation.","Much of the reality in what happens to people has to do with culture, and as far as I can tell people usually can only understand cultures that base their conflicts on something that is socially constructed as a controlled situation. For example, when you play baseball, it is not socially constructed that if you hit a ball with a bat hard enough, it will fly off. What is socially constructed there is that the ball is hit with a bat. Baseball does not control the consequences of the hit. The ball's response to the bat is outside of the control of baseball culture. People know and understand that it is socially constructed that if you're supposed to play baseball, then you're supposed to make the ball fly off by hitting it hard enough. These are controlled situations. However, people have difficulty understanding out of control situations. Out of control situations have their own culture, for example, when calling someone a punk ass b**** creates physical conflict, the situation is out of control.

Physical conflict works differently because its culture is based on the premise that these facts control the culture, instead of the culture using these facts to its ends. Physical conflict uses a different cannot than the cannot that sport uses; it replaces lack of right with lack of physical ability; it replaces structural coercion with direct coercion. The closest that the military comes to the cannot that pacifism uses is that you cannot do such acts as send women to interrogate prisoners by spraying dye on them and letting them think the dye is menstral blood. During war, such acts are frequent and create military tribunals that incarcerate people in their own country's prisons. The closest that pacifism comes to the military cannot is you cannot swing people during the banner drop with rope with that is that thin. Also, the incapacitation and physical harm that happens to people in physical conflict does not result only from the emotional harm or stress, but also from the act itself. For example, when someone is struck with a coup stick during counting coup, they fall down because the culture dictates it, but when they are struck with something else, they fall down and the culture does not dictate this. The person takes on the role of the baseball in that their inability is now outside of their control and outside the control of the culture, it's in the control of the laws of physics.

TL DR, a distinction is necessary between situations like sports and out of control situations. In sports, culture controls the situation, and uses things outside of its control to ends. You are supposed to not use your physical ability to break the rules of that culture. People have difficulty understanding out of control situations because they are not like sports. Out of control situations often times have their own culture, and the culture is based on the fact that the participants routinely break the rules of that culture. This is without regard to the prospect that the culture motivates the situation to exist to begin with.",Character-Comb,2020-03-19 00:04:33,3,541,85.86,67.79,28.32,17.69,22.54,27.36,87.43,56.01,12.57,4.07,0.18,0,1.66,0,2.22,8.5,9.24,17.93,8.5,3.51,5.73,2.77,14.79,4.07,1.85,1.29,0,0.18,2.03,0.74,1.29,0.18,0.18,0,10.91,0,0,0.18,0,16.45,1.48,7.02,0.92,2.59,1.11,4.81,0.37,0,0,0.37,1.85,0.37,1.48,0,0,9.24,0.74,1.29,6.1,0.18,0.92,0.55,12.57,0.55,12.01,2.03,6.47,3.14,0.74,2.59,0,0,0,0.18,0.37,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,10.72,4.44,4.25,0,0.37,0,0,0,0,0.92,0,0.74

fl99kl,Introspective: am I being emotionally abused?,"When you say that you’re searching for the movie on YouTube, but it’s accidentally the YouTube on ur phone and nor the one on the TV which gives you different results. And honestly you don’t register the difference, because YouTube is YouTube right? So when you’re asked which one it is, you actually (maybe as a woman?) don’t even care enough to realise which one it is. A phone, is a phone, is a phone for all intents and purposes.. until it’s not. ThEn all of a sudden you’re a ‘fucking liar’ even a ‘gaslighter’ because 30 seconds beforehand, in amongst the chastising insults being labelled a ‘useless cunt’ you were given space to declare how you were being accused wrongly in such a massive wrongdoing.

Essentially (in the real world to you) you did not do one fucking thing wrong. Was the person chastising you aggressive? Loudly? Would they reach new levels of admonishment and incredulity if you asserted your innocence? 

To be fair... you could never ration your way out of this. Your wrong doing in not looking up ‘dead pool 2’ in the correct way was enough for you to endure the barrage of endless insults such as you ‘lying deceitful birch’. Come on girl, no amounts of tears were going to save you at this point. And so you take it, maybe even accept wrongdoing to make it end. After all... a man conceived of their independent righteousness isn’t likely to admit to their irrationality, that would mean they weren’t right the whole way along! 

Yet still something isn’t sitting right. You know this isn’t how it should’ve ended up. Then ‘right’...you crying silently on your side of the couch.. You have NO reason to be treated the way you have been. (Even though they could provide reasons why you deserve it).

At the end of the day, if you believe enough in what you think happened, truly, no-fucking-body should shake you in that. They will try to; they may lord financial security, relationship security, or any other kind of coveted aspiration of societies ‘grown woman’ over you. At the end of the day you may be gaslighted (forced to believe your perception of events incorrect- that they actually, are the ones being wronged) but BELIEVE in your truth. Trust in your experiences, and know the perceptions you have are valid and right.

We've been dating for almost two years. He is very impulsive and has a dependence on drugs (Xanax, weed, alcohol, NyQuil, several prescribed pills). Just recently it started to become physical and he claims he blacked out after drinking for four days straight and overdosing on medication. Threatened to throw me down stairs, followed me around the house, put me in a chokehold, restrained me, verbal abuse, so on. 

Yesterday he spent the money his dad gave him for meds to refill his prescription for Xanax, which he heavily abuses. His dad had no idea since he lied to him and said it wasn't for that medication. He told me two weeks ago that he promised not to touch another drop of alcohol again in his life(drank anyway) and swore off Xanax all while crying. So last night I said everything that was going on in my head. How my PTSD and dissociation has been affecting me HEAVILY to the point I feel non-existent. He sat there saying ""yeah I know..."" 

This morning I started packing up and he said that I didn't want to talk about it or work it out with him(far from the truth). He impulsively shaved his head bald and I have never been so unattracted to someone before. So now there's nothing attractive inside or out. 

Please don't tell me to go to a shelter or put my cat in an animal shelter either. I cannot go through this without my cat. She's my best friend of 8 years and she always comforts me when I cry. I have no friends and family is very far. I have a lot saved up and don't know where to go next.",FuckingFrog,2020-03-19 17:35:23,5,390,36.18,29.5,90.07,18.23,14.44,15.9,89.49,57.69,19.74,15.38,9.49,0.26,0,5.64,0,4.36,4.1,15.38,8.46,6.41,6.92,3.85,19.23,3.08,1.54,1.54,1.54,2.31,3.59,1.54,2.05,0.51,1.28,0.51,10.77,1.28,1.03,0.51,6.15,10.77,2.31,1.03,0.26,3.08,2.05,3.08,1.79,0,1.03,0.77,5.13,1.03,3.59,0,1.28,4.62,2.05,0.77,1.79,0.51,0.26,7.18,11.03,0.77,19.74,3.85,8.72,7.18,0.26,1.28,0.77,0.51,0,0,0.51,0,0,0.26,0,0.26,16.67,7.44,3.08,0,0,0,0,0.51,0.51,3.59,1.54,0
fllbsj,What should I do?,"I can hear my neighbors (were in an apartment complex setup) fighting a lot. But like, bad. It’s like almost 3x a week the guy gets pissed and you hear him yelling and/or hitting something usually followed by a women crying or wailing out. Sometimes i can make out what he’s saying. Sometimes i can’t. At first it seemed like a couple fighting. But it’s just too constant and i hear different sounds of things being hit. This time, (Today since I’m not at work due to the virus going around) he’s screaming and hitting because   Of “bumping into someone”. Like apparently she’s getting screamed at for the way she bumped into someone and he’s telling her different ways she was supposed to react. Like what?! This doesn’t sound like a typical argument anymore and with everything else, sounds abusive. What are ways I can check up on the female neighbor to make sure she’s ok? Or should I call authority?

fllfga,Never Ask A Survivor Why They Didn't Leave Sooner,"﻿If you’re a survivor, chances are you have been victim blamed/shamed. In the past when it came to sexual assault, it was often the woman that was blamed for “asking for it.” I recall reading a book called “Can’t Buy My Love” that talked about the influence of advertisements. There was a specific rape case where the judge ruled that the woman asked for it simply because the brand of her underwear was Victoria’s Secret. Now, we are finally holding men accountable for sexual assault, but why not for abuse? There is a stereotype that low income or minority females are too “uneducated” to not leave. This is false. Abuse can happen to ANYONE of any social class or ethnicity. Abuse is rarely shown right away. I’m sure if we saw it in the first week we would have run but that simply isn’t how it works, especially in narcissistic abuse. There is a “love bombing” or “golden period” that can last up to a year or more where the narc acts perfectly, the change in their behavior starts slowly and is a brainwash process that has us hold onto the love bomb period in the hopes of them being capable of being that way again. Once brainwash is complete, abuse is the new normal and the voice in your head telling you something wrong is still there but yet you feel trapped to leave. I’ve learned a lot about this type of abuse from this account \*\*@he\_never\_hit\_me\_but\*\* dedicated narcissistic abuse survivors. The handle alone makes me feel validated since I was never hit. Never let anyone judge you for not leaving right away. Leaving is a process and often involves extensive planning to be able to do it safely. No one understands your reality unless they’ve been through it themselves.",blowdontpopclouds,2020-03-19 17:42:05,1,315,37.53,67.16,68.01,1.33,17.5,15.56,90.79,58.1,14.92,7.94,2.22,1.27,2.22,0.63,1.59,6.98,7.62,11.11,11.43,8.89,5.4,3.49,19.05,2.86,0.63,1.9,0.95,0.95,7.62,2.22,5.4,0.32,3.81,0.63,12.06,0,0,1.27,0.63,15.56,1.9,2.54,1.27,4.44,2.86,5.4,1.27,0.32,0.32,0.63,2.86,0.95,0,0.95,0,9.21,2.54,3.17,3.17,0.63,0.63,5.08,12.06,0.63,16.19,3.17,5.08,8.25,1.59,0.32,0,1.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.05,5.08,2.22,0,0,0.32,0,0,3.17,2.54,0,5.71
flloys,HELP ME PLEASE ASAP (mobile post),"I don’t know if I’m posting this in the right place but I was abused as a child by my father and I’ve never told anyone. I’ve always kept it secret even from my mother (they’re divorced) and I fucking hate his guts.
I met this guy that I’ve been talking too for around 6 months now and he’s my soul mate. I love him and he loves me but we met through other circumstances but we don’t know what each other looks like. We just click unbelievably well and I can imagine no matter what he looked like that we could be together forever.
Now I tell this guy everything because I’m so comfortable talking to him and I’ve never told anyone I’ve been abused until yesterday.
Now yesterday he said he needs to speak to me today, so now, just now- he hits me that he’s not a good man and he molested his sister when she was very young (he was about ten years older that her at the time)
I ended the phone call after staying silent and heart broken for half an hour and messaged him afterwards saying to own up to it because I feel for this poor girl (who was not believed!!) and that’s exactly why I would never tell people because of people not believing us!!!!!
I’m heart broken. Fucking in pieces.
And now this????!
What do I do????? My feelings are messed up so much.
Just to point out that I’m also an arsehole because I have a boyfriend and I’ve told the other guy once already that I’m terrible for even talking to him.
My boyfriend is an alcoholic so it’s not all rainbows and butterflies.
I hate people that say this but FML currently.
Honestly...
I’ve cut my arm so much to take the pain away from my head and heart but now that’s hurting too.

flo9u9,(16 F) not sure what happened to me,"i dont know if this is the subreddit i should be in, but i dont know where else to go, so here,
all my life i never really thought back to what happened to me when i was younger, but recently ive gone back to the happenings i went through while i was around 6, and im quite unsure how im supposed to feel about everything.
before going deeper into my experience, ill just explain it,
sadly and very disgustingly, at a family reunion, a cousin of mine (about two years older than me at the time, so 8-9) got me into a room saying we were going to play a game, but then started asking me to show him my parts. i really wish i knew what went through my mind at the time. i only know i didnt want to do anything with him, and i wanted to go away, i was anxious and even though i was confused, i felt scared. so because i was shocked and unresponsive, he started touching me, and forcing me to touch him, like quite literally moving my own hand with his, it disgusts me just talking about it, it hurts like hell to remember it.
it wasnt masturbation though, he was a kid and didnt know shit. just plain nasty touching.
after a few minutes he decided we should live and go back to the reunion, and so we did. 
as soon as i left the room i knew what happened in there was not okay, i felt the need to cry, yet i didnt. i felt really sad and wanted to cry to my mom, but i was really ashamed and felt humiliated, so i never did, not to this day, no one knows about it but me and him, for all i know. i just ignored him until i grew older and just didnt see him again, we now live in different countries.
what hurts me the most is how a day later, another cousin of my (girl, 6 as well) went to her parents in between a family meal and said this cousin tried to touch her, yet she stopped him. everyone got extremely mad at my cousin, and his family just left while shouting at him. i didnt say a word.
now what really pained me was my moms sad face, asking me if he did the same to me, and how i just said no.
my dilemma now is, am i valid of being and abuse victim? was i abused? am i just stupid and way too sensible? i feel so dumb because just the memories are coming back so clearly now and it is hurting me so bad im having nightmares.
and i never thought anything big of it, but if its not a big deal, then why does it keep coming back to me?
i want real opinions, thanks in advanced if anyone read this, really.",etivla,2020-03-19 20:55:38,5,501,7.5,9.4,97.05,1,22.77,11.58,95.81,64.67,22.36,16.97,12.77,0.8,0,3.39,0,5.39,3.99,11.58,7.98,12.18,10.78,3.39,21.16,4.99,3.39,2.4,1.4,1,6.99,1,5.99,1.2,1.8,1.6,8.98,2,0,1.2,2.79,16.77,3.99,1.2,2.4,2.59,2,6.19,4.59,0.4,1,2.99,2,0.6,1,0.2,0.2,5.59,2.99,0.4,1.2,0.6,0.6,9.98,8.18,1.6,15.17,2.79,5.79,7.58,0.2,1,1,0,0.2,0,1,0.6,0,0.2,0.2,0,13.57,3.39,7.98,0,0,0.8,0,0.2,0,0,1.2,0
flos2r,Ex lives with me and makes dun od my chold abuse,"I am so used to no one believing me with the abuse  I don't know what to do. I feel like I am living in hell. We broke up months ago and I can't get him to leave my place. He told me that he will sue me for all that I am worth if I leave since he is on the lease.

I hate him. I hate how angry he gets. I hate that he is a slob. I hate how racist he is. If I have to hear another racial slur, I am going to lose it. I hate that he never pays his portion of the rent and that he believes that he is above criticism. He told me recently that people who are moral are losers and that you should screw everyone to get ahead. I like that is what he is doing to me by complaining about how much I suck and he hates living with me, but he always throws his money away for Kratom, his guitar, and his luxury car. 

He makes fun of the fact that I may have sustained brain damage due to all of the beatings I had to endure. He makes fun of the fact that I have a slighr stutter and calls me a ""brain damaged stuttering retard"". He makes fun of the abuse that I suffered overall. He loves to rub into my face how much of a loser I am compared to my abuser.

With everything that's happened, I am afraid to even go outside for a walk anymore (before it was just safety concerns). Now, I feel so self-conscious. I feel  so ugly and that everyone is laughing at me.

flosbp,"i always told myself that if i were to be in an abusive relationship, i'd leave. but i'm still here.","he loves me. that's what he tells me and his actions show it sometimes, too. when we met, he found me at a very low place in my life and he definitely brought me out of it. of course i fell in love with him not because he was """"available and helping me"""" but because of how fucking wonderful he was to me. it didn't even seem too good to be true, because we argued in the beginning, but we always got through it in the healthiest way and ended up stronger together after. so i thought ""hey, this guy might be the one who's gonna treat me right. he knows my past, he knows how to not be an asshole, things are great!"" so after a few months (we've known each other for years bc of school but didn't really get close until we got older) i moved in with him. left my home state, left my social life. i cut ties with literally everyone (except immediate family) in my life because he didn't like any of my friends. i didn't think anything of this, because it's not like i wanted my bf to *like* my friends, and my friends weren't *super* close to me so i was like whatever. we argue like regular couples and yeah he yells sometimes but i thought this was normal (as normal as arguments get i guess). everyone gets mad sometimes right ? 

the first time he hit me i blamed myself. i honestly thought to myself ""omg he's not the type to hit me, i must've done something extremely wrong for him to get that mad at me."" ((this is despite the fact that the first time he hit me was when i found a burner phone he was hiding from me and when i unlocked it i found that he was cheating on me. i forgave him. to this day, i don't know why. he knows about my past and how i've been cheated on so many times already, but i still for-fucking-gave him)) 

now, i've lost count. i have a secret folder in my snapchat where i take pictures of all the bruises and scars he leaves on me. he yells all the time. he calls me ""stupid, worthless, dumb, chink-eyed bitch, useless, lazy, bum, slut, whore, etc"" he says things to me when he's mad like ""i want to/i wish i could kill you, i hate you, i don't know why i'm with you, you mean nothing to me"" he's choked me to the point of me almost passing out and has held a knife to my neck before. 

it's a very typical abusive relationship which sucks to say. ""he hits her, she stays because she loves him/doesn't know how to leave and he never changes."" 

and i know it's bad for me but i'm still here. i'm still here because every time i pack my bag i end up waking up next to him. every time i pack my bag, i get anxiety without him. 

i don't work. he won't let me have a job. he's working full-time right now. i've applied to so many jobs and have gotten called for so many interviews (at good places too) and he doesn't let me go to the interviews. i always feel bad when i get a call from an employer and then i schedule an interview only to not show up. i don't know how to tell these employers that i'm not a lazy, unreliable employee candidate. he pays for everything so yes i am very dependent on him. i can't leave because then i will be homeless. i know i could go to a shelter, but i know he will find me.

flpch6,I can't even speak,"Tl:Dr I'm terrified, unable to talk to anyone about any issues including him. What do.

I (F23) have been having issues with my partner (M24) for a while now. But recently it's been getting much more difficult to try and stifle the feelings of dread since I'm unable to talk about things anymore.

Example one, I didn't like the idea of taking the job he wanted me to take. I wanted to express how frustrating it has been but that I'm still willing to do the job. This was selfish of me. I shouldn't have spoken up. Because he has done so much so I shouldn't be bitching.

Example two, I am unable to apologize when my words or actions may have affected him. Because it's just ""the same thing over and over again, and [he] don't want to hear it."" 
Example three, we disagree in parenting. But I'm unable to speak up even though he is the step parent. I am told I don't know what I'm talking about and how obvious that point is. But he has done things I'm truly not comfortable with. But if I bring it up then he gets angry. 

I'm really trying not to get too specific i guess. I don't think he's on Reddit but I truly don't want him to find out I'm even asking for any advice since I shouldn't talk to anyone about anything regarding him unless it's good things. I know if he finds this it'll be a huge fight and he might just kick me out as he has threatened to multiple times.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm terrified for reasons I can't even say for fear of being found out asking for help. I can't even tell what's right side up.

flphu6,Am I being abused by my mom?,"(apologies for my bad English)
My mom threatens me to break my phone and all my devices if she finds scabs caused by acne.

I developed a bad habit of picking my face whenever I get acne. I do it subconsciously when I'm bored or stressed, I started doing this since I was 8.

My mom has gotten tired of telling me not to do it and began threatening me, saying that she'll break my things. She broke a phone of mine when I broke something once and so I don't have doubts she's more than willing to do it.

Whenever this happens, I beg her not to do it and she ends up just hitting me and lecturing me afterwards.i live in Mexico so hitting a child for discipline is normal here.

Right now, there's a big open wound that's like 5 mm wide and resides on my forehead. I'll wake up around 6 am to see if it formed big enough for her to notice it. I'm taking advantage of the fact that she's not wearing glasses and can't see that well (but I don't think that'll do much)

Sorry if this is all over the place(again, apologies for my English) if you also happen to have advice for acne then I would appreciate it very much",TemporalySteph,2020-03-19 22:29:02,6,228,7.83,11.82,81.22,1,22.8,12.72,92.98,61.4,25,17.54,13.6,0,0.44,3.51,0,7.46,2.63,11.84,11.84,6.58,9.21,2.63,21.05,3.95,1.32,1.75,1.75,2.19,6.58,1.32,4.82,1.75,1.32,1.32,8.77,1.32,0,4.82,0,10.53,1.75,1.32,2.19,3.07,1.32,4.82,2.19,0.88,1.32,0,4.82,1.75,3.07,0,0,8.33,0,0.44,4.82,2.19,2.19,2.63,13.6,1.75,11.84,0,5.26,5.7,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,0.88,0,0.44,0,0.88,0,14.47,3.95,2.19,0,0,0.44,0,0,0,5.26,2.63,0
flpwq6,I nearly escaped my emotionally abusive dad at 18,"Today, my friends gave me a wake up call. 

It was like any other day, I got up this morning and said hello to my sister. I pet my dogs and fed them. My dad was at work who normally works till 10pm. My friends wanted to hang out so we did, and while doing so they found out about how severe my situation was. I nearly had no to little will to live left, and I was accepting my fate when my dad said he'll be off work the next following days. My friends and bf were practically sobing and begging that I take action now. So I did. Because They told me I've been fighting for a decade and fought too hard to give up. I told them if it was the right thing to do, and they all said yes. We packed my things in a matter of 45 mins and with one goodbye to my sister I was gone. I'm now in a hotel with my friend and her parents (they also recently moved away from an abusive home) and saving for an apartment. I plan on working in the Mexican restaurant right next to our hotel. They've been staying here for a couple weeks and already saved a decent amount for an apartment. We plan on getting my license and ID sometime in the future. I'm still scared and shock from the experience and I would love some support, I hope you guys understand. My dad said he won't accept me after this, and I'm grabbing my furniture next week. (Today is Friday) 
I just hope I made the right decision. I just wanted to break the chain that should be broken. And my sister seems to be doing just fine.

flrziq,Transphobic asshole next door takes advantage of me.,"So I met this guy on a dating app and he turned out to live right in my building only a few apts over.For context I am 19yr old closeted FTM he is 25yr old ""straight"" he pretended to be bi and be into me so we me up and I ended up sneakin into his house at night to hang out and stuff. Everything will be fine while we were hanging out but right after he would text me and missgender me and overall be a total dick to me. Its complicated but he was very abussive to me during our ""relationship"". I ignored the signs cuz I was abused as a kid and still am at home by my parents so it was easy for me to fall to the same patterns. The point is that tonight he actually psychically hurt me. He just keep hitting me in the face and wouldnt let me leave. I kept begin him to please let me go home but he wouldn't he choked me and made fun of me when I tried to fight back because and I quote ""You're a woman and you'll always be weaker than me"". Hes a gaslighting manipulative psycho he would always be really mean and make me cry and then pretend nothing happened and try to make me feel crazy because of it. He called me crazy several times actually everytime I wouldn't blindly obey his every comand. It got to the point that I tried to kill myself, he then proceded to blame me for that to. He literally told me it was not his problem and that am just weak and that I deserve it. I kept telling him to stop and that he was hurting me and that I was having panic attacks and crying all day because of how he was making me feel and he just said ""Thats life, things happen to you and you deal with them. You don't fight back"".Theres so much fucking more to this story but the point is that since I can't report him to the police because then I would have to explain why it happend, come out as trans and I also live in an abussive household so my parents will just say it's my fault. The worst part is that he lives so close so I can't really escape him. I was hoping I could post his info here and see if you guys could mess with him a little bit. I don't know if thats against the rules but if it is let me know I was not aware sorry anyway.

TL;DR Transphobic homophobic asshole that lives next door takes advantage of me and psychically and psychologically abuses me. I can't tell anyone or call the cops because my situation is complicated. Here is his info could you hurt him a little bit?

fltgp7,I’ve had to rethink my entire life,"Last night I was speaking with a friend and casually mentioned something about my parents, but apparently that’s not normal and they think I’ve been emotionally abused and neglected for most of my life.

I laughed it off and asked a few more questions, just to see if they really were joking. Apparently not, and after a very long conversation with my closest friends it seems that my entire life has not been normal. 

For example, apparently most parents keep track of their kids medication, especially when it’s life-saving (epi-pens and inhalers). Or most parents don’t use you as their only emotional outlet (screaming, crying, yelling). Don’t expect you to go hungry because they are too busy arguing. Or don’t force you to be in charge of grocery shopping for the family. Oh and apparently most kids don’t have to call childline on a parent multiple times.

Stuff like this though I can elaborate more if needed.

But yeah, apparently this plus a lot else is abuse and neglect. I wish I could say that this was a joke, but I found this out last night and I don’t know what to do anymore.

Sorry if this doesn’t count, I’ll delete it if my friends were overreacting.",finnthedinosaur21,2020-03-20 04:28:21,10,216,11.23,28.91,48.89,1.2,16.62,17.59,95.37,58.33,18.52,11.11,7.41,0,1.39,0,2.31,7.41,3.24,10.65,12.04,6.48,10.65,4.17,18.98,6.94,4.63,0.93,0,5.09,6.48,1.39,4.63,0,1.85,1.85,11.57,2.31,1.39,0,0,19.44,2.78,1.39,3.7,8.8,1.39,6.94,2.78,0.46,2.31,0,3.7,0.46,2.31,0,0.93,5.09,4.17,0,0.46,0.46,0,4.63,12.04,1.39,7.41,0.46,2.78,4.17,0.93,1.85,0.46,0.93,0,0,0.93,0,0,0.46,0.46,0,18.06,5.56,4.63,0,0,0,0,0.93,0,5.09,1.85,0

flwitb,Was it really that bad?,"So, I was raised by my grandparents till my tweens because my parents were busy working. 

I don’t know if my parents were bad but I get no parent is perfect. My parents probably would say so too. I stayed with my parents a bit when I was young. My parents would fight each other. My mom would swear a lot and hit me with newspaper. My dad took us to sports every Friday and he learned about pressure points, so once when my sister talked back he just grabbed her arm and pushed down. I once felt sick and said ‘I don’t want to go’ and he said ‘you go or I’ll give you a reason to feel hurt’ or something like that, and then told me I didn’t get dinner but then later gave me dinner. He always had this face he made when he was mad and it scared the shit out of me. 

I’m pretty sure during this time (6-7) I was molested in Sunday school. I have memories and recollections of it, but they’re weak. We got me physically examined later in life but since it happened so early it would be impossible to actually gain any evidence. All I know is that when the doctor went in to look at my cervix, I had a huge flashback and shook the rest of the day. 

My grandpa and I were super close and he began to decline in health right in front of me. He had a stroke once and I saw it happen in front of my own eyes. I was like ‘I don’t know what to do I just need help’ so we got the police and yeah, he wasn’t the same after all the strokes. He had dementia and began forgetting me and everyone else and he died in front of me. Took his last breath in front of me. It was traumatizing. My grandma has diabetes and had episodes where I had to call the police while she was honking the horn saying ‘let’s go to school’ even though she was hypoglycemic. It was terrifying. I wasn’t even in middle school. My dad was like ‘lol that’s not traumatizing that’s just experience’ and I’m like ok cool I was like maybe less than 10 years old what do you even mean. 

My parents stepped in after but it wasn’t the same. I’d lash out at my dad a lot. He wasn’t around at all because work (he still denies this and gets mad and says ‘ok you wanna say that? Ok cool let’s just go with that’ which makes me feel crazy) and so I had no relationship with him. He would yell at me a lot and I would just yell back. I’d cut a lot. I’d force myself to throw up and starve. My mom would always say you’re kinda chubby’ or ‘are you really gonna eat that?’ And so I began this from the age of 9. I still struggle with it even though now she says ‘oh you’re too skinny, now you look sick’ or ‘wow your hair is so thin, why does my baby have all these bald spots?’ Like ok thanks mom. 

After this, I dated a girl and it was ok at first. But then she began to isolate me from my friends and get jealous if I hung out with anyone else. She would say ‘oh idk if I like you’ and just on and off leave me in the dark for 2-3 years. She would kick me and punch me. Once she held a knife at me in the car as we were driving somewhere and I was terrified. She also loaded a gun in front of me and held it at me. Also scary. She would say if I left she’d kill me then herself, she’d say she wanted to shoot up our school, she’d describe wanting to stalk people and drive them crazy. After we broke up she began stalking me too. After school she’d appear places she never was waiting. She didn’t even like coffee (she got mad at me for getting her Starbucks and made fun of me that entire day after and it was just humiliating) but she was there. I panicked and left and had nowhere to go. She also would hang around outside the school after hours, or appear on my route to classes. It was daunting. I tried to get administration but nobody did anything. 

I have CPTSD from everything and it cripples me. Every day I live on eggshells and feel like something is about to happen. I’m on meds but I just don’t feel happy. Or sad. I just feel empty. 

Idk if it’s that bad. I question it a lot.",njav574,2020-03-20 08:06:42,4,806,10.73,38.28,80.01,3.88,14.14,8.81,95.29,62.16,23.95,18.36,11.17,0.99,1.24,4.84,0.12,5.46,3.23,12.03,10.3,6.7,10.42,2.23,21.84,4.84,2.85,1.12,1.36,1.99,6.45,2.11,4.34,1.12,1.24,0.62,12.78,2.23,0.12,3.6,2.61,13.65,2.11,1.12,2.73,3.6,1.86,4.47,4.09,0.87,1.61,1.49,2.85,0.74,1.36,0,0.74,6.95,2.36,0.87,1.99,1.61,0.37,8.68,9.93,0.87,15.88,2.11,7.07,7.07,1.86,0.37,0,0,0,0.25,2.11,0.12,0.62,0.99,0.25,0.25,15.76,6.58,1.49,0,0,0.5,0,0.25,1.24,4.96,0.74,0

fm15p0,Abuse survivors— How did you get over it?,"Hi Reddit—

2016-2017 I was in a terribly abusive relationship: physically, mentally, emotionally, etc. He almost killed me several times but that’s not the point here because I don’t want to go into details, just included for context. 

The thought of him still haunts me &amp; the embarrassing part is, I still dream of him &amp; crave him. He terrifies me, makes my palms sweat, fearing he will reappear &amp; ruin me once more. YET, part of me still yearns for his touch &amp; presence even though he utterly destroyed not only me mentally but financially &amp; physically as well. What is wrong with me? Can anyone shed some light? 

Not ONE single day goes by that I don’t think of him. Every morning when I leave for work, I am worried he might be watching me/stalking me. 

Certain songs, smells, etc, cause triggers which result in a mixture of emotions— regret, disappointment &amp; worst of all, the sad realization that I miss parts of him. 

To sum it up, I am just wondering if these thoughts, reactions &amp; emotions are normal? Obviously regret, disappointment &amp; such is normal, but why do I miss him too, why do I crave his touch sometimes? He fucked me up BAD when we were together. How could I think anything positive towards a monster like that? It makes me wonder if I am a monster to. 

Abuse survivors— How did you eventually get over it? Will I ever stop thinking about him? Will I ever be able to get my life back in control? &amp; am I a complete maniac for still feeling lust &amp; wanting for him? 

PLEASE no negativity. I am genuinely reaching out because I am at a lost.",lraex,2020-03-20 12:33:02,0,299,21.97,25.16,39.46,1,13.59,19.06,89.63,56.19,20.74,16.39,10.03,0.33,0.67,5.35,0,4.35,3.34,10.7,9.03,9.03,4.68,2.34,17.06,3.34,1.34,3.01,1.67,2.68,10.37,1.34,8.36,1.34,2.34,3.34,8.03,0,0,0,5.35,17.73,3.34,4.68,2.68,3.34,2.68,3.01,2.34,0.67,0.33,1,2.34,0.67,1,0.67,0,8.36,1.34,1.67,2.01,2.01,1.34,2.34,12.04,1.67,11.04,1,4.68,5.69,0.67,1,0,0.33,0,0.33,1,0.33,0.33,0,0.33,0,22.41,4.01,6.35,0.33,3.34,3.34,0,0.33,0,1,0,3.68
fm2o5f,Is it actual abuse or am I thinking weird?,"I'm a 17 year old female who lives with my mother. She is chronically ill and I usually have to do many things around the house. I usually wouldn't mind but if I can't do what she says in that moment, she will stare at me silently until I do it. She will also whatever me. 

 A couple nights ago a huge misunderstanding broke out in my household. My brother came to my house while my mom was not home and started screaming at me. He was saying that I was disrespectful and that he is not afraid to beat my ass. After being alone in the situation, she finally comes home. That didn't stop him. At this point I was crying and he told me to get up before he slapped me. I got up and stood there. He threatened to call the cops and have me taken away. I look to my mom to help and she looked like stone. She was staring at me with these dead eyes and I knew she wasn't going to help. She told me that I better get my act together or she'll send me to my dad.

Here's the kicker, I didn't do anything. If anything, it's mom who is being disrespectful. She made me grow up too fast and makes me feel like I don't know anything. My brother brought up his dad's abuse and said I have it east. I really don't but know I think that I'm thinking too much into it.

fm3bzw,How do i warn someone they are dating an abuser or how to out him publicly,"My former best friend left me because of this guy and i knew about his abuse against his gf before and so im pretty sure my lose is due to his manipulation but i left it alone but i had another friend to ask me if me and this girl (former best friend) are still friends and if i have her number i asked why he said he found out who shes dating and was hoping to talk to her to warn her. He gave me the story how he bumped into her but wasnt allowed to talk because her bf is around and hes “crazy and overprotective” and even when he got her number she suggested “to call me when hes not around which is not possible” to me that raised alot of red flags to me. She cut me off from her life but i still care about her and dont want her hurt. 

My friend told me more stories about him that every gf he has had he had abused and manipulated and hurt so much so his last one my friend had to personally escort her to the police precinct to file a report. Parts of me dont know if her cutting me off is her choice or his influence but it just sounds like she has no more freedom no more friends to talk to. I just want to warn her or her sister but afraid to come off as a jealous friend or ex or whatever but i want to out this scumbag so bad because i dont want her hurt and guys like that doesnt change. Any advice or should i just leave it alone and mind my business?",niloc1987,2020-03-20 14:40:22,5,302,5.48,65.46,4.68,1.07,37.75,8.28,95.36,64.57,25.83,21.19,9.27,0,0,11.59,0.33,4.64,1.66,12.91,8.28,6.95,13.91,2.98,14.9,4.64,3.64,2.98,0.33,2.65,7.95,2.32,5.63,0.33,1.32,1.99,22.85,0.33,4.3,7.28,6.29,16.23,1.32,3.97,2.98,4.97,0.66,6.62,1.99,0.33,0.66,0.99,0.33,0,0.33,0,0,9.27,4.64,0.99,2.65,0.99,1.66,5.63,10.26,0.33,8.28,0.99,3.64,3.64,0.99,0,0,0.33,0,0,1.32,0,0.99,0,0,0,4.3,1.99,0,0,0,0.33,0,0,1.32,0,0.66,0

fm6rzc,Concerned about my friend’s wellbeing.,"Okay so four days ago, I made a post here outlining my friend’s situation. I’m not going to explain it in full detail, since the long post is still up, but I’ll do a TLDR.

- Basically, my friend has been in an abuse household for years now, since he was 3 I believe, and myself and his other friends only figured it out recently. His dad is currently serving time for a different charge. -

The problem is how my friend is dealing with things. He’s currently staying at his aunt’s house with his little brother and sister. I’ve spoken to his sister a lot over call, and she’s told me that he seems off, jumpy. That he doesn’t sleep at nights, that he cries a lot. It’s pretty unlike him, he’s always been the type to have the ‘boys never cry’ mentality. 

The other day, he called me at about 2 in the morning. He had school, I didn’t, so I was concerned about why he was still up. When I answered, his voice sounded wobbly in a way, like he had been crying, and he kept sniffing so I knew it to be true. I asked him what was up and he told me he couldn’t sleep, he was having nightmares. He went on to explain the nightmares to me, which again I’ll brief because they were quite long.

- Basically, he was having nightmares about his dad. He was dreaming about what could/would happen when he gets out. He told me he was scared he would kill him etc -

The last few days, this nightmare situation has become ongoing. Every night, he doesn’t sleep until ridiculous times on the morning. Today, I met up with him one last time before our quarantine and he looked like a mess. His has dark circles under his eyes, his movements were janky; almost robotic, and he looked like he was going to burst into tears. He’s always been pretty thing, since he’s ridiculously tall and quite skinny it never looks great, but he looked even worse off. Even his eyes looked duller, not anywhere near as blue as usual.

I don’t know what to do. I can’t erase the fear of what his dad is going to do to him when he gets out, because no matter how much I try to reassure him we’ll find a solution, nothing works. What can I do to try and help him? I’m so scared for him.",throwawayacc151546,2020-03-20 18:18:00,1,418,16.32,75.62,20.37,2.51,15.48,11.96,94.5,62.44,23.68,19.14,6.46,0.48,0,11.96,0.24,4.55,4.55,13.64,13.16,6.94,6.22,2.87,21.77,4.07,2.15,2.87,0.96,1.2,6.46,1.67,4.31,0.72,0.96,0.96,18.18,1.67,0.72,0.96,12.92,12.44,2.63,2.39,1.2,2.63,1.67,2.39,3.11,2.15,0.72,0,1.44,1.2,0.24,0,0,5.98,2.39,0.96,1.67,0.72,0.48,8.13,11.24,1.44,17.7,1.91,7.18,8.61,0.72,0.24,0.48,0,0,0.24,0.48,0,0.24,0.24,0,0,20.33,6.22,6.94,0,0.24,0.24,0,0.96,0.24,5.26,0,0.24

They also know in the past you’ve been raped and have a lot of trauma behind it. But you’re crying out of fear of the yelling and them throwing stuff. 

So you say yes to the sex even though you are visibility crying and shaking and when they ask you if you want to stop you say no because if you don’t give them sex it is much worse with the other abuse.  

So you put up with the sex because of fear and don’t let it stop because of fear of other abuse.

fmc5dh,I need help on this. Is this normal?,"Wanted to give a heads up that this deals with heavier situations/topics.


So, when i was around the age of 13 I went to a mental hospital to help me with my suicidal thoughts and depression. The place was horrible and caused me a lot of trauma. The staff were abusive and gave me so much medication that on my 8th day of being there i only thought it was my 3rd day due to how out of it i was.
So, for the most part i barely remember everything that happened there but sometimes i get random flashbacks to moments I either blocked out or didn't remember due to the medication.

One I recently remembered happened around my last day there. The only reason I left was due to the fact that i had a melt down during visitations and my family forced me out of the hospital, by now I'm questioning if this was one of the things that caused my tipping point.

I have bad psoriasis, it was especially bad back then. Covered 75-80% of my body, so i constantly had to use medicine. The staff would give me it after taking my pills and I'd go to a private room by myself to apply it.
Well, near the last day a nurse didn't hand it to me but instead took it, brought me to a different room, took my shirt and pants off without warning, then started applying it to my body. She then went on to go underneath my underwear to apply it onto my backside.

I was too confused and dazed to really do anything or tell her I was uncomfortable because the medication instantly hit me with drowsiness/fuzziness but i remember feeling humiliated and shocked by it.

She was a female nurse, kind of sweet but could be very rude at times. She often picked favorites as well. This memory just came out of the blue and i instantly felt so fucking disgusted and shocked because it didn't seem or feel right and I never remembered it until i was just randomly looking back on my experiences there. 

I'm questioning if it's okay for me to feel this way about it. I feel guilty because maybe she was just really use to taking care of little kids and got carried away? Is that behavior normal? No one else did that to me, ever.  I'm scared to see a doctor and talk to them about my mental health and worries though because i don't wish to deal with that all over again, too much happened in such a short amount of time and yet i barely remember most of it. The place is still up and running despite all the horrible reviews.",throw_away3396,2020-03-21 01:56:45,1,468,36.88,9.27,97.39,1.27,19.5,16.45,95.09,61.32,19.02,12.18,10.9,0,0,1.07,0.21,6.84,5.34,15.17,7.26,9.4,8.97,1.5,17.52,4.91,1.71,0.43,1.28,2.14,5.34,1.07,4.27,1.71,0.85,0.21,3.85,0.21,0,1.28,0,16.24,3.85,2.56,1.5,4.7,1.5,4.49,2.78,0.64,0,1.71,4.06,1.07,2.56,0.21,0.43,4.7,0.64,0,2.56,1.28,0.64,8.97,6.2,0.85,16.03,1.92,7.05,7.48,0.85,0.43,0.64,0,0,0.21,0.85,0.21,0,0.21,0.43,0,10.47,4.49,2.56,0,0,0.64,0,0.21,0,1.92,0,0.64
fmf0y2,(f16)I think my mother is toxic?,"(sorry for english, not my first language)
 i kinda feel bad writing this because at times she's very kind and helps me out if i need her. But there's just been so many times she's hurt me or damaged me emotionally and I'm not sure how to take it: as a start when i was 9-13 she would use me as her therapist and cry about my father(who hanged himself when i was 3) and her parents(who never loved her and are abusive) which really screwed me up because it showed me the shittiness of life when my mind was still very fragile (this robbed me of my childhood because i was made aware of many bad things when i should have been playing with dolls and being carefree); when i was very suicidal(developed depression and social anxiety at 13) she would mock me and tell me to just get it over with because im being a burden to her; when i did attempt suicide she brushed it off; if i upset her she sometimes threatens to kill herself or that shell abandon me;i told her that my brother had been abusing me mentally and sometimes physically since i was 7 till 14 and she told me i was lying and never accepted it because ""he could never do something like that""; she gets angry super easily (starts screaming and manipulates you into feeling guilty and stupid) and while now ive learned to ignore it as best as i can, when i was little she would stop cooking and cleaning for a few days as punishment (i was around 9, and i think that's kinda neglect) etc etc, theres many other things but the point is our relationship has been so unstable and it confuses me since when she starts acting nice again i feel bad for hating her and being hurt in the previous moment. i feel like i need to forgive her everytime because i know her life has been living hell, but its hurting me so much. Do you think she is being toxic or im just searching to blame someone for my problems?(thats what she says if i ever bring up her actions) i plan on moving out when i finish school and find a stable job but I can't help feeling like im overreacting, i dont know if she abusive or not since she changes by the day(also she seems very unaware that shes doing these things)",fruityconfetti,2020-03-21 06:33:31,8,426,2.17,28.65,66.01,1,85.2,14.79,94.84,63.85,26.29,19.95,12.21,0.23,0.47,7.04,0,6.34,1.88,9.86,11.5,7.75,13.62,1.88,21.36,3.29,2.11,3.29,1.88,1.17,10.8,2.82,7.98,0.94,3.52,1.88,12.68,0.94,0,6.57,0.94,16.43,3.99,3.29,2.82,3.76,1.41,4.23,3.29,0.47,0.47,2.35,2.58,0.23,1.64,0.23,0.23,6.1,1.88,0.94,1.88,0.94,1.41,5.4,11.97,0.23,12.91,0.94,3.29,8.69,1.17,0.47,0,0,0.23,0.94,1.17,0.7,0.47,0,0,0,10.8,0.7,1.41,0.23,1.17,0.47,0,0.23,0.47,1.41,4.69,0

They went ahead and said that they were never attracted to me either... ouch. I guess I’m happy for the honesty since I had been going to therapy for over a year trying to solve the puzzle, but then later decided it wasn’t worth it, to now knowing the truth.

Little back story, they were younger than me, I felt a little apprehensive to date them but I took the chance, and we had some highlights. But they held a lot of secrets behind doors with other people. 

ASSAULT TRIGGER WARNING

About 6 months later, they broke up with me, but were still talking to me everyday... I guess now cause they felt bad. Until one day I was sexually assaulted, and they got upset so went and had sex with someone else. And after that they didn’t speak to me for maybe another year and a half later. I had developed major ptsd from the relationship and also the assault. I already had depression and anxiety, was pretty insecure from my upbringing. Abusive mother and sexually abusive father.

Do you think some people are just meant to be on this world to teach others a lesson but not necessarily to be happy?

fmg29w,I miss my abuser,"4 years. I had a daughter(7) from a previous marriage. I’m 28, he’s 29. 

There’s no doubt whether he was abusive or not. He’d put his hands on me on several occasions. He called me nasty, vulgar, demeaning things quite consistently, even racial slurs at times, told me I was loose and disgusting. Told me to stfu when I tried to speak about my feelings. Would claim he didn’t say certain things, resulting in me questioning whether I was really experienceing the things I felt. He made me question my sanity. I mean how could I have heard that if he insists he didn’t even say it? He would yell at me and slam doors and stomp around. He’d break up with me for 2 weeks, go out and have unprotected sex, (mind you, in the bed that I purchased with my money for us. Because he wasn’t comfortable sleeping in a bed that I had previously shared with my husband) then beg for me back without telling me of his sexual escapades and putting my health at risk. He’d hit up other women while I’d be out of town. This last time around, he wrecked my car and wouldn’t pay the deductible to have it fixed. 

Now, this wasn’t constant. And that’s part of the mind fuck of emotional/mental abuse. There were times of extreme highs. Buying me anything I wanted, literally washing my hair and bathing me, pampering me, doing things around the house, paying bills, showering me with love and attention. And I was made to feel as if those things were luxuries, not just the standard for a long term “intimate” relationship. The highs were so fucking good. I thought no other woman could touch me. I thought I had something special. “Hes so hardworking, and handsome, and strong and manly right? It’s ok if he’s just a liiiiitle mean right?” I thought at first. Everyone has their bad days,...right? All men call names right? Maybe if I just be a little more careful about what I say, he won’t do that to me. Maybe I can be just a little better. Maybe I can do more for him. Then he’ll REALLY love me. Right? 😔 

It got worse. It got harder for me to prove my love. And in all this, I admit, I became jealous. I became insecure. All my confidence became tied to what kind of day he was having. 

If I noticed he was being kind or polite to a woman, I became jealous and insecure.. why isn’t he that nice to me??? How can he be so sweet to women he barely knows?! They don’t wash his clothes or cook for him or wash and massage his feet after a long day at work? What’s wrong with me that he only wants to be nice to other girls? 

He’d make me beg for sex. He never initiated... so when I saw him looking at other women, I internalized it. I felt inadequate. What don’t I have? Why doesn’t he come after me that way? Why doesn’t he lust for me too? 😔

I know that jealousy and resentment don’t have much room in relationships, but it’s not what I wanted or who I wanted to be. I wasn’t insecure in myself. I am beautiful, attractive, in shape, I work hard, I take care of the people I love, I’m fun to be around, I’m creative, I’m genuine, I have a joyful, youthful soul, I am adventurous, and sensual, and attentive. I forgive easily and love unconditionally. I was insecure with him. I was always on shakey ground. I never felt truly at home in his heart and I fooled myself &amp;amp;amp;amp; succumbed to the abuse and accepted it. I’m ashamed. 

He came from a home of alcoholism and substance abuse and absent parents. His father left when he was an infant and his “mother” was a drunk stripper who was in and out of jail. I blame a lot of his issues on his mothers inability to properly love and raise children. I could go into detail, but for times sake, she was no mother. 

He claimed I tried to isolate him from his family, which I refute to my death bed. I never kept him FROM his family. I was adamant that I did not want his alcoholic/drug addicted family, criminal family members at MY home or around ME, or my daughter. Surely that’s an understandable personal boundary. He was free to go see them as he pleased. I never asked him to not see his family, in fact, I encouraged it, as I thought he could be a good influence. I asked him to stop drinking if we were going to be together, and he did, so I figured he could help them. 

I admit , maybe I was fixing him. Maybe I just loved him and wanted to show him a better life. But it’s not like I saw him as a “project” from the beginning. This all unraveled and revealed itself over time. He was someone I fell in love with, and as I learned more about him and his troubles and his past... I just wanted to help him. I wanted to love him properly. I wanted to give him something he never had. Love. Structure. Purpose.

But you can’t love someone who has never been properly loved nor can they love you properly. 

I finally mustered the courage to say that enough is enough. And this isn’t how love should feel. I should feel safe in love. Not afraid, and worried, insecure, unwanted, or small.

See the thing is , abusive relationships aren’t black and white. They’re not just all bad, or it’d be easy to get out/leave. If they were JUST horrible , no one would get trapped in them. It’s easy to walk away from something that’s 100% bad. But It’s a frequency. It’s extreme lows followed by extreme highs. It’s the confusion of “wow he’s so amazing , he must really love me.” And “how can someone who loves me treat me this way? I need to fix this.” I keep trying to remind myself that abusers aren’t normal, and what I went through isn’t normal. I am ashamed, I’m angry. I’m sad, and confused.

Why do I love him? Why can’t I hate him? Why do I miss him? Does he care? Does he regret treating me with such hatred and disdain? Will he ever apologize? Does he know just how much he has lost? Does he now appreciate my ability to forgive and grow and love? Will he ever understand or feel remorse for the amount of damage he has inflicted on my spirit? Did he know what he was doing? Was it covert, or a consequence of his upbringing? Is there really nothing more I could have done to calm his storms? 

I have found a strength I didn’t know I had and I’m learning to let go. I have to let go of the good times. Because as real as they were, they weren’t the truth. The good times were just fixes he would give me. Just a little heroin to keep me close enough, but weak and dependent. 

I’m not weak anymore. He cant control me anymore. I am hurt, but I’m strong. I’d rather BE alone than be with someone who makes me feel alone sitting right next to him. I’m free now.",cblaine92,2020-03-21 07:49:14,0,1252,7.48,33.03,48.45,38.55,10.43,13.66,93.93,61.42,25.4,19.57,11.42,0.16,0.24,7.03,0.72,5.83,3.12,10.62,12.38,5.75,7.83,3.51,20.85,5.35,1.52,2.32,0.64,1.2,10.06,5.35,4.63,1.2,1.52,0.88,15.42,1.12,0,0.96,7.35,16.13,3.59,2,2.8,3.27,1.92,5.03,2.8,0.88,0.56,1.2,3.59,0.4,0.88,0.48,0.48,8.23,3.04,1.2,2.32,1.04,1.2,6.87,11.66,0.64,10.54,1.52,5.11,3.91,0.72,0.96,1.28,0.64,0.16,0.08,0.32,0.24,0.08,0.08,0,0,22.04,8.07,5.19,0,0.32,2.24,0.08,0,0.96,4.47,0.32,0.4
fmgpen,Trapped in my abusive mom's house,"Around 4 days ago, my mom dragged me (F16) out of my dad's house while he wasn't there, I didn't have any other option but to go or else she would've beat me until I went with her. My mom, basically, is an abusive piece of shit. She used to beat me up regularly and gladly she doesn't anymore, but the emotional and physiological abuse is abundant nevertheless. I won't go into detail because of my own reasons, but the point is I've been trapped in her house for days. My dad keeps ignoring my calls probably thinking this will set me straight and to never ""misbehave again"", everytime that I ask her to take me she freaks out saying that I'm staying here forever and that I live here now. She lives in a fucking trailer with her abusive crack addict husband, even though my younger sister is here I fucking hate being here. I've never been more miserable. I'm not the type of person to cry, and I've been crying regularly every day. Even my younger sister is worried about me.

Worse part is I dont know how to get out, and my girlfriend (F17) Is coming down from virginia to my dad's place in a few days and is staying for 4 days. I need to be there to meet her, but I dont know what to do without alarming my mom and making her go look for me and tear my fucking door down. I'm so desperate.

fmlfy1,I love her. I miss her. But we can't be together.,"I am grappling with the aftermath of an abusive relationship and I'm looking to hear from people that have shared a similar experience. I've been trying to make sense of things. I am trying to move on. But it's hard when I am overcome by self-doubt. At times I question my perspective. Hopefully there are some people out there that can help me process and understand what happened.

I know that I made huge mistakes in our relationship. Early on, I was dishonest with her about being tested for STDs. When the lie was revealed  (6 months later and 5 months sober) I promptly got tested (we were having unprotected sex). Thankfully, my test came back negative. But at the time she was scared for her health. She wanted to know how many sexual partners I had had and what sexual acts I engaged in. I get that she was afraid and hurt but there were some some things I didn't feel comfortable sharing with her. I felt awful (and still feel awful) for what I had done. 

Even after this when we were trying to move past it all she would still aggressively interrogate me about things. Which I understand that her anxiety rose as a result of my dishonesty. But at times I had to lie because I didn't feel comfortable answer her questions. She demanded answers. During these interrogations, she accused me of being a homosexual, a pedophile, and having a fetish for large women. It was all humiliating and untrue. But in the midst, I began saying things I didn't believe. I didn't know who I was anymore. I was just saying things she was looking to hear. I just wanted her to stop.

Looking back on things, I believe she had a hard time forgiving me. She still carried a lot of anger. During arguments, she began hitting me, keeping my phone and keys from me (so I couldn't leave or reach out for help), creating distance between me and my friends and family, and accusing me of having borderline personality disorder. On top of that, my ex was now saying I was abusing her. She talked to someone from the Domestic Abuse Hotline who confirmed it. I called and explained my perspective and they said she was being abusive. This made me confused about the situation at the time and I continue to question myself. It got really bad. It was unlike any relationship I have ever had before.

I finally decided leave her after our last argument. Our conversation was heating up I asked for space. She refused. Overwhelmed, I ran to the bathroom and tried to close the door. She chased after me and put her body in between the closing door. She screamed ""you are abusing me"" as I tried to push her out of the bathroom. I realized in that situation I was not the aggressor. I was seeking space from her. I also started to see that keying my car, chasing me out of the house, swinging a guitar at me, punching me in the head, cutting my clothes off with a scissors, and holding me next to a knife were things I didn't deserve. Even if I felt like I had deserved them for destroying her trust in me.

Sometimes I wonder, had I not made the mistake would she have behaved in this abusive way? If I had been sober and honest about being tested for STDs would this all never have happened"" Or would similar behaviors eventually show itself? Was she capable of abuse all along?  We both wanted to move past it all and try to make it work. Our fights kept escalating. It was out of control. She could become full of rage. It was scary and overwhelming. We were engaged. But I had to leave.

Didn't think spouse was taking the virus seriously enough. They have a minor procedure at the hospital next week and am scared because that's ground zero.  Seems an unnecessary risk. They've also mocked me a few times for being worried about the virus. So told them they were being too dismissive about risks. 

They ooked at me with a lot of anger and said, ""Fuck you."" Ranted for a moment and repeated it. Denied they were not being serious and then they stormed off. 

Came back a while later and apologized but I knew they absolutely meant it. We have since hugged and kissed and made up but...they told a friend earlier they're still a little salty and TBH I can't get past it. They're often heavy handed in the teasing department but sometimes it doesn't sound like teasing.

fmq6mm,I dont know what to do ( Reposted from another subreddit ),"I'm 16 years old and im in high school. This morning, my dad started arguing with my mom, I don't know what it was about but mostly it was about money. But as the argument kept going my dad makes these claims that my mom is cheating on him, which isn't true because mostly she stays at the house or goes to work with my dad. Whenever my mom tries to argue back my father yelled back more aggressively and he thinks she's lying about stuff. These arguments happen every two weeks and it's starting be be a problem, and surprisingly my mom isn't going to do anything about it.

She thinks it's not a big deal that my dad insults her, she doesn't even care about herself and doesn't get any help. She keeps saying she's unhappy and yet she doesn't want to get any help. I tried to convince her to get help but she say things like: ""They might call the police on us"", ""We don't to end up in the news."", and ""What could they even do? They can't help me.""

Her refusal to get help is making me upset and angry. I asked about talking to my school counselor but she really didn't want me to get help.

This isn't only happening to my mom but also me and my brother. During Christmas break, my little brother cried as my parents were arguing and my dad threatened my little brother to keep quiet or he's going to get beaten. For me, when I make a mistake like bringing the wrong things to him such as household items or food, he yells at me and tells me to write an essay apologizing to him. I currently doing an essay for him right now but I don't want to complete it and give it to him. Also if I make him mad one more time he said he will punch me in the face repeatedly and he doesn't want anyone to stop him. My mom heard what he said but didn't do anything and that really breaks me.

My dad always thinks he's in the right, he thinks that I should be like him, and he thinks that I shouldn't go to college until I change myself. As you know convincing my mother is impossible and no matter what I say. she won't do anything. I can't go my school counselors because my school is closed because of COVID-19 and won't be opened until April 15th or later. My phone has been token away from me for 1 week. I really need help because I can't take his yelling or threats, I'm even depressed. I'm also wondering if this is enough to be emotional abuse.",Pinballwiz60,2020-03-21 17:13:15,1,469,6.45,43.22,47.88,1,18.76,11.51,96.16,61.62,26.01,19.4,11.09,0.43,0.21,7.04,0.64,6.61,2.56,11.73,10.87,5.33,9.81,4.48,23.45,3.41,1.92,1.71,1.07,1.28,6.4,0.85,5.54,0.64,3.84,0.64,18.76,3.84,0,4.48,6.18,14.93,2.35,1.92,2.77,3.62,0.85,5.54,2.35,0,2.35,0,0.43,0.21,0,0,0.21,7.68,2.77,1.07,3.41,1.49,1.07,3.2,17.27,1.49,11.51,1.92,4.48,5.54,2.13,0,0.43,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.99,5.12,2.77,0.21,0,0.21,0,0.21,1.28,5.76,0.43,0

fmrbm2,we’re free,"(tw for suicide, drugs, abuse (obviously), vomit)
after about 14 years of having to deal with our narcissistic, abusive father, we finally moved. from beating my mum half to death, to making my autistic, 7(i think) year old sister eat her own vomit (among other abuse), emotionally abusing his children, taking my mums prescription adderall and then crushing it up and snorting it but then proceeding to tell her that SHE was a junkie, heavily abusing our animals (throwing them at walls, grabbing them by the head and shoving their face into their piss and feces, hitting them, etc) we are free of him. there has been such a massive weight lifted off of my chest it is unbelievable. like i’m actually finally able to breathe again. of course we still have to go through the process of divorce but we will never again have to feel the dread of him coming home everyday to do god knows what to us. i’m finally fucking free. to think that i was planning on committing suicide last year because i was convinced we’d never get away from him. i’m glad i didn’t because then i’d never get to experience this feeling. it’s indescribable.

btw i will be posting some things i’ve recorded him saying while he was yelling at us and also letting yall know who he is so if you ever see him in real life you can cross the street ( or perhaps beat him with a crowbar).

anyways i just wanted to share. just know that things do get better, even if it’s just a little bit better. obviously i have to deal with what that man has done for the rest of my life (for example he gave me anxiety and agoraphobia which has been proven by a psychologist that he was the cause). but things will get better, even if it takes 14 years.

fmubu0,Abusive brother in law.,"When I was younger, my older sister started dating this guy who is about a year younger than her. They were both in college except he wasn’t even attending college, he just moved there to be with his friends. 

This guy would later become my brother in law. I’ve known him since I was about 5 or 6. Now this is the stuff that makes me feel upset. When him and my sister bought their house, I would go over all the time. I can remember this one specific time when my sister left the house and me and my brother in law were playing hide and go seek. I hid in their closet while he went around the house looking for me. Fuck this is so nasty. He came into the closet and his **** touched my head. I didn’t know it at the time but it took me a couple of years to figure out what it was. Holy shit this is so disturbing. 

Also around this time, he got new cars because he owns a business that he started with my sister. We would drive around the neighborhood and he would “teach me how to drive”. I’m not sure if he actually meant it but I would sit in his lap and we would drive around. I would feel his blank so many times to the point where I just stopped wanting to go with him altogether. It was so gross.

He also had a desk in the “living room” of the house. He would always be there. One time, he bought me the video game “thief” for his xbox one. I was playing in his room, again while my sister was out of the house. Now this room has direct sight of this desk, at least the side. So I was playing and got bored. Went to go see what he was doing and he was -bating. While I didn’t see it going on but I saw what was on his computer screen. 

A couple years ago when I was 13 or 14, me and him went to his brothers Fourth of July party. We were buying fireworks and we’re heading back to the car when he said “I almost slapped your ass because I thought you were (my sisters name)”. This happened another time when we were leaving a sporting goods store, 

Fast forward to now, I am a 16/F and in high school. He got his medical card for marijuana and so he bought a cartridge. For those who don’t know, it is a portable weed vape that doesn’t leave a lingering smell on you or any smell for that matter. It was sometime in December so it was cold. We went outside and hit this vape on two rocking chairs close to the side door of his house. He asked me if the cartridge made me horny and I told him “not this one” referring to the one in his hand. He told me that it made him relaxed. Fucking disgusting. His nanny who was 19 at the time was living in their separate bedroom. He was talking about how her boobs are always out because of the tank tops she wears and my sister told him to start wearing pants around her. He started talking about blow jobs. By the way he was in his briefs while we were outside. He said that if the nanny ever offered to give him one, he would say no. This made me feel so disgusted because I was so high that I couldn’t distinguish if he said “you” or “(nanny’s name”. I still don’t know which one he said.

He always buys me stuff. Clothes, electronics, and most recently a car. I feel as though he has a grasp on me and my entire life. It’s so gross. He’s had marriage problems with my sister and he likes to punch walls. This year he punched a massive hole in the wall while his two kids were there watching. Watching him and my sister fucking argue. They watched this. He also threw a chair into the wall. This broke my fucking heart because my nephew is very young and has non verbal autism. My niece was about 2 1/2 years old. 

I feel trapped. I know that my sister does too. It seems like she absolutely hates him. I feel like I’m in such a weird situation because he also feels like my dad. My dad has always traveled the world, he builds airplanes for a living so he’s always in another country. My brother in law is the only father figure I’ve ever had in my life. He also makes me depressed. When I was younger I thought about killing myself to get away from him. We would have explosive arguments and one time we were at my mothers house. My mother and sister were trying to mediate our situation but he said that I “undermine” him constantly and he slammed the door shut. Hard. He made the whole house shake. I was surprised that it didn’t break. Another time, I asked him why him and my sister were there at my house while me and my mom were trying to leave. I was in the car and my mom was inside, apparently they were trying to drop off some chairs. I asked him the question with the windows about 1/4 of the way down and he hit it so hard I thought it was gonna break. I cried for two hours straight after that. 

I feel like I’m being held captive. I need to move away but I’m scared for my niece and nephew. I do not want them to endure what I have. I just can’t do that. I need to protect them but it’s hard when my sister won’t leave him. My mom and me have tried to get her to leave him but she won’t. I’m not sure if it’s because of the fact that they have kids. He always calls her a piece of shit and everything of the sort. She always defends herself and I fucking wish that she would know how appreciated she is. She helped him build his business and is the “accountant/ HR/ everything”. She is a fucking wonderful woman. I’m not sure if she’s worried about my nephew not receiving the same amount of care as he is now due to all of the money that they have. She deserves better. I deserve better. 

If you read all of that, I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for listening to me. I’ve never told anyone any of the stuff I said in this post. Thank you.",ahsjshaka,2020-03-21 21:55:57,1,1132,15.2,65.46,46.63,10.25,12.86,11.13,95.05,61.13,25.53,19.52,9.1,0.88,0.62,8.04,0.88,6.01,4.95,11.04,9.36,6.36,8.39,1.68,20.14,3.8,1.77,1.86,2.03,1.68,4.24,1.5,2.74,0.44,1.24,0.27,17.23,3.09,0.35,3.27,7.77,11.84,2.39,1.59,2.3,2.21,2.03,3.09,3.09,0.88,0.71,1.33,2.12,1.06,0.53,0.71,0,5.92,3,0.53,1.33,0.71,0.53,8.13,8.57,0.62,16.25,2.92,7.07,6.45,1.41,1.15,1.94,0.88,0.09,0.09,1.06,0.88,0.09,0.09,0,0,14.58,7.77,1.59,0,0,0,0,0.09,1.59,2.47,0.27,0.8

fn01gv,My boyfriend uses my childhood abuse to take advantage of me and it’s getting worse since we’re stuck in quarantine,"This is becoming too much for me. I was traumatised when I was very young so I get very sensitive when people yell near me or especially yell at me. Specifically men yelling 

My boyfriend knows all about my childhood and my anxiety around yelling. He still will sometimes yell at me knowing it makes me fear for my life. Sometimes I think he does it on purpose to control me. 

We’re stuck inside because of this virus and it’s been terrible he’s so angry he just wants to leave and he’s been yelling at me so much everything I do is wrong and I get so upset when he raises his voice at me but it only annoys him when I tell him how it affects me 

I don’t know if he realises but sometimes he’ll yell at me for something and then later in the day he acts all lovey and wants sex and stuff and I always give it to him so he stops yelling. But I don’t enjoy the sex I only like the sex because I know he won’t yell at me during sex. 

When he’s annoyed he makes me feel so uneasy especially now that we’re together all day stuck inside. I’m really scared because he’s so angry 24/7 and he just gets angrier when I try to talk to him about it and I always breakdown when he starts yelling at me 

I don’t know I feel so dumb I know if our relationship dosent work then I should be breaking up with him but I always just crumble when we argue cause he purposefully intimidates me and yells in my face and he says things about the abuse I had when younger knowing it makes me shut up. I wish I never told him about my abuse because I feel like he just uses it to take advantage of me",crystalfalling22,2020-03-22 06:33:49,11,339,2.43,33.97,84.69,1,30.82,13.57,96.76,63.72,28.32,23.3,14.45,1.47,0,7.37,0,5.01,1.18,11.5,7.08,11.5,12.98,1.47,22.42,4.13,1.77,2.95,0.59,1.47,10.03,0.88,9.14,1.47,6.49,0,12.98,0,0.59,0,8.55,16.52,3.54,4.72,1.77,2.36,3.24,2.36,4.72,0,3.83,0.88,2.06,0.29,0.59,1.18,0,7.96,2.65,1.77,0.88,2.36,0.88,2.65,16.22,2.36,15.93,0.29,6.49,9.14,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0,7.37,2.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.42,0,0.29
fn1eny,Confessing to myself that I was in an abusive relationship,"This is a confession admitting to myself that I was in a long term mentally abusive relationship. I finally understand 2 years later why I never looked back, why I can't look back, and how upset I feel when I do. 

I come from a first generation traditional Chinese household. We value family and education above anything else. In 2013 I moved to a different town and was the new kid in a high school where everyone basically knew everyone. It was then that I met someone online from the same town, we clicked, and we got together. I started making friends and it felt like I was having a normal high school life. 

Over the year, he revealed that he was physically and mentally abused as a child by his siblings and mother. He tells to me that I was the only person that ever gave him a chance, and there was nobody that he felt a connection to. He gave me opinions about each of my friends, why he thought they weren't good people. I slowly stopped seeing the friends that I had made and spent all my time with him. It was weird because I felt fulfilled. My parents were too busy working to ever teach me what it was like to feel emotionally important. For once, I felt important. I mattered to someone.

I started hanging out with him daily and fought with my parents daily about the matter. They told me that I was wasting my time emphasizing that my grades were more important. But I didn't listen because I felt like the world was so much more than grades. That a personal connection was what fostered a true human being. I was angry and hurtful, but I didn't care. This tear between my parents and I would continue for 5 years.

Suddenly, his father passed away junior year. There's not much else to be said except that is was a hard year to get through for everyone.

Senior year rolled around and I had worked hard enough to have many options available to me. I expressed my dream but he convinced me that there was no other option than to go to the local university. So I stuck to the plan that we would both go to the same university.

He did not get accepted into the university. 

I spent the next 4 years trying to fix and mend a man that never wanted to be mended. I got a retail job while attending college to help pay for food and groceries. I paid for him to get his permit (which to this day he still has not gotten a driver's license). I negotiated with my parents to spent 4-5 days with him so that he could feel secure again. I never spent any holidays/birthdays with my own parents and always spent them with him. If I went anywhere with a group of friends, he needed to be there too. In actuality, I couldn't and didn't make any friends in college. He would detail some excuse where that person was bad due to some flaw. In the end, I only had him and online games.

He constantly questioned if I loved him, and it hurt me to be constantly questioned. Of course I had loved him, I wouldn't dedicate everything I had if I didn't. It came to a point that I just I couldn't have sex with him and I didn't want to. He begged and I can't ever forget the moment that he crossed that line. I would go home and lay in bed crying because I felt objectified. 

My grades dropped. My mental health dropped. I physically and mentally couldn't do it anymore.

One of the friends I made helped me realized that I was babying him so he could never develop as an adult. That the entire situation I was going through was toxic and mentally abusive. In 2018 I broke up with him and never looked back. 

I admit that all the choices I made were my own. Nobody forced me to make them. They were made so that I could feel whole, so I could feel like a good person, so I could take care of the person I loved. But amongst it all, I forgot that I needed to take care of myself. That I also had dreams and ambition. That I needed more than just to be a caretaker.

I regret hurting my parents, I regret not going to the college I wanted to, I regret letting my mental health drop, I regret letting my grades drop. I feel like I've closed so many doors with out any way to open them again.

fn3kn3,I’m not sure how to feel about what happened as a kid,"This is really embarrassing to share and I’ve never told anyone this. When I was very young, about 4 years old I think, my older sister and I would play a game called ‘mums and dads’. She’s a couple years older than me. I won’t get into the fine details but basically we both ended up naked in bed together and not much happened that I can even remember to be honest. I forgot about it for a long time but after leaving an abusive ex it started to come back to me. I love my sister with everything I have but that one memory just makes me extremely uncomfortable, I’ve cried about it and spent so much time feeling like shit over it. 

Maybe she feels the exact same, who knows. I wouldn’t dare bring it up with her. I’ve noticed that that memory (along with a few other unfortunate ones) pop up a lot when people touch me. I couldn’t even be naked with my ex gf in bed because the feeling just made me sick. The skin contact is the worst part. 

As I said previously this is really embarrassing and I don’t know what to make of it at all I just know that it haunts me most days. I’ve never ever told anyone because of the shame. I was just a baby, I can’t understand why it happened. I don’t know what it means. I just feel so ashamed and alone. I don’t blame my sister but it still upsets me so much. I don’t know how I’m supposed to have a normal relationship if the thought of someone touching me makes me want to be sick. I don’t know how to process any of it.",lilthrowaways,2020-03-22 10:40:59,3,303,11.69,15.31,96.23,1.7,15.15,10.89,98.02,61.72,23.43,14.19,12.87,0.33,0,0.99,0,9.24,5.28,11.88,8.91,10.23,7.92,4.29,21.78,6.27,3.3,3.3,0.66,3.63,6.93,1.98,4.95,1.98,0.99,0.66,10.89,1.98,0.66,2.64,0.33,20.13,6.27,3.3,1.65,2.97,2.64,3.96,2.97,0,0.33,2.64,2.31,1.32,0.66,0.66,0,6.6,3.3,0,2.31,0.66,0.33,6.27,14.19,0.33,11.22,0.99,3.96,6.6,0,0.66,0.66,0.33,0,0,1.32,0.33,0.33,0,0,0,14.52,6.27,1.65,0,0,0,0,0,0.33,5.61,0.66,0
fn50j6,today is my anniversary,"this time last year i was at my parents house. it was a friday, and the past sunday my now ex had lost it at me. we were preparing to go out for a meal, but she got anxious and stressed and took it out on me. again.

&amp;#x200B;

during that few hours, as i was explaining to her that she was the most important thing to me and that our future would be happy, as i desperately tried to calm her down as she berated, pressured, humiliated, maniplulated and gaslit me, i saw the future. it was me and her, going through the same cycle again and again until she snapped and either killed herself or both of us. i knew the prospect of us being happy would never happen because of her.

&amp;#x200B;

onthe friday, i waited until she went to work. the moment i rang my parents to come and pick me up, i felt anxiety in a way i'd never felt before. i thought she'd come home early and discover me leaving. i thought i'd forget something important. when i walked through my parents front door with the last of my stuff i felt relief. i had escaped. the nightmare was over. 6 years that had started with affection and laughter had descended into resentment, anger and violence.

&amp;#x200B;

of course that wasn't the end of it. i drank daily for months. there were times i considered going back. we did message for a while; the messages became easier and were like when things were good. then i realised i was in danger of being sucked back into the situation i'd escaped from. because i knew that despite me getting on with her, i did not trust her. if i gave her the opportunity, she would hurt me. possibly even kill me. at the point i stopped responding to her.

&amp;#x200B;

so here i am, a year on. i no longer fear going home or getting screamed at for hours, having to try to calm the uncalmable. my mental health is good. i've realised who are my friends and who aren't. i spend more time with my family. 

&amp;#x200B;

but now given the quaratine, i realise some of you are still in your abusive situations. my heart goes out to you and i hope you know there are resources available for you in this troubled time.",silvyrphoenix,2020-03-22 12:00:46,2,409,34.18,33.87,97.69,10.38,12.78,14.67,94.13,60.64,23.23,18.58,12.22,1.22,1.22,3.91,0,4.65,4.89,14.18,9.05,4.16,7.82,1.47,19.56,4.65,2.69,0.98,0.24,1.47,8.56,3.67,4.89,1.71,1.71,0.49,9.78,0.98,0.24,3.91,0,8.8,2.93,0.73,1.22,2.2,0.49,2.44,1.96,0.24,0.73,0.98,0.98,0.24,0.24,0,0.49,8.56,2.93,1.22,1.47,1.71,1.47,9.78,6.11,2.2,20.54,3.18,6.6,11.25,0.73,0.24,1.22,0.24,0,0.49,0.49,0.24,0,0,0,0,18.58,7.58,4.16,0,2.69,0,0,0,0,1.71,0,2.44

fncxjk,I don’t know what to feel anymore,"I (26M) have been living with my abuser (father) since I was born. My mom, brothers and sister all live in the same house with her grandparents. My mom’s brothers use to live with us, and so did my older brother. My uncles never really cared for my mom being beaten and just moved out. The only reason my mom married my father in the first place was cause her mom didn’t want a grandson (my older brother) to be a bastard child.

What’s also twisted is that she and her (grandma’s) husband use to abuse my mom and her brother when they were younger.


Recently, my older brother has been out of the house for 12 years, and since then, it’s just been my parents, grandparents and my two younger siblings. 


I don’t know what to say because I’m 26 and I’m taking an entree exam to get into medical school, but I’m not sure if I’ll pass. Then I’m also looking for jobs in case I don’t pass the exam entree. I’m actually scared because I’m slowly becoming an independent, and my father has nothing to hold over me. The reason I feel so strange about it is because I’m happy that he’s realizing he has no control over me...but I’m scared because I’m afraid he’ll try to hurt my family.

He likes to pretend and say he’s too old and needs me to care for him (which I ain’t going to fucking do) but he a few months ago he threw my mom across the house, and I had to fight him off. He’s always trying to fight my younger brother because he’s taller than both of us, but he has a weakened heart condition. My sister is a pretty small girl too, and they’re both a few years younger than me.


Though now that he has been drinking more so lately, going to the gym and fucking around with his friends, he’s trying to pick a fight with me. He’s trying to make me do things and gets pissed when my family tells him to back off. The reason they do that is because for the past years since I was 14, I’ve been having to do the things that my father, grandfather, older brother and uncles could never do. Which was reparations on the house, fixing the appliances and keeping up with anything else in the house. Shit, I was practically helping my mom raise my younger siblings and my older brother because they would have me do things a father was suppose to do. I listen to all of their problems too with an open heart, but lately, I’ve been so out of it.


I’m starting to get back to how I was for awhile where I can’t sleep. Where I get kind of these paranoid flashbacks of my father beating me or my mom. 

And I’ve wanted to call the police so many times but the law here where I live at is more in favor of the father. She use to work too, but every time she got a job he would harass everyone at work to the point she would get fired. The only time I was able to work was if it was at my school or university. Elsewhere, he tried putting his family on me. 


So with that brief background, I just wish I had the focus and attention to just put it all on that entree exam. But it’s so hard to concentrate when these memories and emotions betray me. I can be at a library, cafe or some other place and these thoughts betray me.

Thoughts of rage and sadness. Ones in which I just wish I could end it all and sleep. I tried talking to my siblings or mom (since they spoke to me about their suicidal thoughts) and all I get is either “Why would you think that? Are you stupid?” Or “Okay. We all fee like that.” And that part hurts because when I listened to them, those are the last comments I ever make. 

I’d try talking to my friends too, but they’re like my family. I help and listen to them, but they won’t listen to me.

The reason I’m so hardwired on trying to be a doctor is because I want to heal other people when no one did the same for me. I even made promises to dead men who told me to do greatness and it’s just a heavy load on me.

I don’t know if I unknowingly became a pillar for everyone around me, but it’s hard. Sometimes I wish I could just cry, but I have nothing coming out. I kind of wish I could be better instead of being stuck in my mind. I kind of wish I had someone to tell me I’m doing alright.


And a part of me wants to feel hopeful because if things go right this year, I’ll be able to kick him out of the house...but the other part of me feels that would never happen.


Everyone around me is going crazy and expect me to be the stable and strong one for support, but I honestly feel dead inside.


I don’t know what to think or feel anymore. It just feels like I’m always dying inside.",Masked_Kei,2020-03-22 20:12:35,3,894,16.54,30.34,81.59,12.44,18.24,11.74,97.09,62.86,22.37,17,12.3,0.34,0.22,3.13,1.01,5.37,4.81,12.86,12.19,6.38,9.4,1.9,22.26,4.25,2.57,2.01,0.78,2.13,5.15,2.01,3.02,0.45,1.57,0.45,13.42,5.03,0.22,2.46,5.03,16.89,3.02,3.36,2.91,3.13,2.24,4.36,2.24,0.11,0.78,1.34,2.01,0.67,0.89,0.22,0.22,7.27,3.02,1.79,1.68,1.01,0.11,4.47,13.98,2.01,12.75,1.57,5.48,6.15,1.79,0.78,1.12,0.11,0,0.45,0.78,0.56,0,0.22,0,0,16.22,5.82,3.47,0,0,0.22,0,0,0.45,4.92,1.34,0

fne3jp,I don't know what to do,"I'm a minor living with my grandmother and her husband. I've been living with them since about January or February of 2019 because my mother is dealing with her own issues. My grandma's husband is a disgusting alcoholic who screams and cusses constantly, and he sleeps on the living room couch and I have to listen to him snore loudly every. single. night. (listening to it now, actually). He's screamed at me, and he has hit me before. He says cruel things about my mother, and about me and my younger brother, and if I say anything back, my grandma and aunt get mad and yell at me because they say I'm ""only making it worse"". They've threatened to *punish* me because I was defending my mother against him. They consider me defending myself ""talking back to adults"", and I'm so damn tired of it! 

Living like this everyday has given me depression, and living with my mother isn't an option at the moment. I don't know who to go to, or if there's even anyone who can help me. I'm not sure if it's considered wrong for a child to live in a house with an alcoholic, but I've witnessed him stumbling in drunk *many* times. There was even a day where I was sitting on the living room couch, he came in drunk, and fucking straight up FELL ON ME. Needless to say, I was very pissed off. He's also fucking shit on the floor outside of my bedroom door. Yeah, you heard me. He *took a shit* on the floor like some kind of animal, *right in front of my door.* I've also caught him jerking off in the living room at least three times. 

I've thought about reporting it, or saying something to the counselors at my school, but I'm afraid of being put in foster care. People in my family (not my mom) are always beating it into my head that living with my grandma and her disgusting husband is better than being in foster care, but I don't know anymore. I've been yelled at, hit, fallen on, he hurt my mom in front of me. I'm so fed up at this point, and my grandma keeps saying she'll divorce him, but she won't. She's been saying this for *years* now. 

I've been dealing with this for *far. too. long* now, and I'm afraid of what will happen to me if I say anything. If the police get involved, I'll get in trouble by my grandma and aunts. They're so convinced that I have it so good here, and they keep telling me they've dealt with him longer than I have, and they've had much worse from him, and if they could deal with it, so can I. Is that fair, though? Or am I really just being pathetic? 

Sorry this was so long (I just had to let out all of my pent-up frustration and anger), and I'm sorry if anything I've said here sounds ridiculous or dramatic, and I'll greatly appreciate and take any and all advice given to me to heart.

fnfw8d,"I need your help, is this abuse?","I created this account to get this out of my chest and read the opinions of other people about this situation.

So, about some time ago me and my sister started seeing this relative again once a week. Nothing weird (that I remember of) happened the first year of seeing them but then, oh boy, it got really weird.

The first incident (?) happened when we (me and this relative, let's call them J) were sleeping in a couch and they pulled up my shirt to see my boobs (I was a literal child then, now I'm a teenager). I went home feeling really bad, but then my memory totally buried it, I could not recall this happening until now. Then I think they stopped because I can't remember a thing.

Until some months ago. You see, one day I literally passed out because of a problem with my medication, (it was J's visit day) so they put me in their bed, they didn't raped me, but they got on top of me and they were really close, our private parts were touching (I'm sorry if I sound vulgar but I don't know how to describe it). Since that, everything got worse, everytime we go to J's house they touch my butt, and they also attempt to touch my boobs and my private parts. 

And then, about three weeks ago something happened, J kissed me with tongue (like you would kiss your girlfriend), it was really disgusting. J stopped because I wasn't kissing back and then they told me that ""it was our secret"". My sister was there, I don't think she saw it but she was there.

I'm scared, I don't want to go visit them anymore and I don't want my sister near them. I really want to tell my mom but I don't know how, or if she will believe me. My greatest fear is that J does something to my sister, something that I could've stopped if I had spoke.

fnj8lj,Broken Family Dynamics,"Sharing for someone very close to me.. let's call him Rai.

He caught his cousin (21yo) molesting his sister (13yo) through taking a video on what's going on under the table while they were watching a movie. He told his mother and they decided to talk to his aunt. The aunt wanted him to delete the video and promised never to let his son go near her sister again. But Rai is not stupid to delete the evidence.

I talked to his sister to comfort her and tell her it's not her fault to make her understand that it's not ok for others to do that to her and she should always tell her brother and me next time someone does that to her. She told me that this cousin has been very touchy since she was in 3rd grade. That she stops him but he won't...and I was never prepared to hear another revelation...her own father does the same, too.

It was like a pandora's box. I my heart was pounding if I should tell Rai that their father was molesting his sister. I told him anyway. He was not shocked. As if he expected the worst from his father. He was a womanizer and was never really there for the family. Giving them money and basic needs is enough to be called ""responsible"". He was a seafarer and most of his time at home were spent with friends and sidechicks. 

We agreed that we'll tell everyone when he comes home so that it would be easier face to face with him and the mother.. It would be easier as well in case they decide to put him in prison. He can't run away. We were worried about Rai's mom as well for she loves her husband wayyyy too much and her children are all she really have. She' too dependent with her husband. Too much that let's him womanize as long as he goes home to her. A total MARTYR.

We tried to make Rai's sister understand the complications as of the moment for his father is in the sea. That we will settle everything as soon as the father comes home by January (Revelations happened at December). But little did we know that she'll be talking to their guidance counselor at school. Rai was called by the guidance about it and understood our situation and promised that it will be private and confidential. She knows that the news will destroy the family and the family's business.  (They own an apartment bldg behind their house and a pre-school owned by One of his Aunts) The guidance councellor suggested that her sister be sent into therapy by a child psychologist. And the mother should know. NOW.

We told his mom. She cried. She called the father. He denied doing it of course. He said he was only able to touch the pubic hair and he was only joking with the 13yo girl. (We have this bad culture of touching toddler's private parts in PH as an endearment or a joke. I experienced it when I was a kid. But not as a teenager. And NEVER FROM A MALE)

All the father did was blame the mother and and Rai. He suspected Rai of bypassing him and reporting into the Guidance councilor. I was mind blown.

He is truly manipulative and toxic. As expected we felt the mother protecting her husband that it was only a joke but sent the girl to therapy. 

The father went home and found out about what the cousin did to the girl as the cousin's mom talked to him and still he blamed his daughter and wife about it. He called them sluts and they wanted it to happen. 

By the way.. his father and his siblings are very solid. The siblings would ALWAYS come first before the family. Rai's mom was  never in-charge. They live altogether in a compound and monitored by his aunts next door. The father will always believe his sisters first. And they are enablers of his womanizing. Rai's uncle even sends money to his father's mistress for him. 

At the moment Rai is stuck with me at the quarantine as their house as away from the city. We both work in the city.

He is quiet but I know he is thinking about his family and his mom would NEVER put her husband in prison for two reasons. She loves him too much and there'll be no one to support her and her 2 kids (1 girl (13yo) and 1 boy (8yo). She has no work and Rai... is saving for our marriage. We both are. 

The mom btw is hiding what is happening from her 8yo kid. saying that she has to pretend everything is fine when he is around. I think she's using this as a reason so we won't judge her for still clingin to her husband. 

This is the most sickening about it. The whole family is acting like nothing happened. Rai tried to ask help from his aunts but of course they did NOTHING. Rai's father provided money for one of the Aunts to put up another building next to the apartment for her school. The molesting cousin's mom btw is receiving salary from Rai's dad as a payment for managing the apartments. 

I just want to share this as I don't really know what to tell Rai atm.",Gr3yCN,2020-03-23 05:36:23,0,912,44.42,98.59,1,35.34,12.67,12.5,92.21,59.32,20.18,15.13,1.86,1.75,0,9.98,1.54,5.04,6.91,13.71,8.88,4.82,7.57,2.08,17.32,3.73,2.85,0.77,0.99,1.43,3.84,2.19,1.64,0.11,0.44,0.11,26.64,6.8,0.11,7.57,8.44,9.54,2.52,0.88,1.64,0.77,2.3,2.19,1.32,0.33,0.44,0.44,1.21,0.44,0.44,0.22,0,8.77,5.48,0.88,1.75,0.11,0.66,6.03,8.99,1.43,9.32,1.75,3.95,3.73,2.08,1.32,1.86,0.99,0,0,0.88,0.11,0.33,0.11,0.22,0.11,14.04,8.99,0.11,0,0,0,0,0.22,0.22,2.85,1.64,0

fnme7u,Confronting my father about the past,"When I was younger, say 4-9 years old, my father used to beat me up a lot, sometimes over really dumb things that every kid does like spilling popcorn or talking through his phone conversations. 

The beatings were heavy and I wasn't allowed to cover my face with my hands.

I'm in my 20s and I have forgiven him, but I notice that in my subconsciousness I'm sometimes scared to say things in front of him or talk about my feelings, even though I don't expect him to beat me up anymore and he hasn't done so in a long time. I often imagine him getting triggered when I say certain things. Again, I'm not  logically expecting it, but my instinct makes me feel very cautious when I'm around him. Maybe other people who've gone through the same recognize this.

Anyway, he is very friendly to me now and we get along well, but I find it very hard to open up to him and talk about my feelings. We are both very entrepreneurial and we've done several projects together which have been successful. He also wants me to come work with him as a partner and eventually take over his business.

Before I'm ready for this though, I have the feeling that I need to be able to stand up to him and tell him what I think about certain things, not only in business, but also on an emotional and personal level. 

Do not get me wrong, if I wasn't interested in his business and I didn't do these projects with him I would still want to open up to him and tell him about my feelings, of course, but now I got the feeling that I'm at a point where it really needs to be dealt with.

I live on my own now, so there's no risk of creating a lot of tension in the house when I confront him about this, if things get out of hand, which I don't expect, but as I said, am very cautious about, I could just go to my own house. 

I wanted to confront him about it for a few weeks now, but I can't go see him because of the corona virus breakout, so I'm thinking about doing it over the phone.

I'm very nervous about it and really don't feel like it, but I know I have to do it if I want to get a good level of communication with my father. 

Do any of you have some advice about how to go about this, how should I start the conversation, what are the possible outcomes?

fnwley,now ex-stepmom would give my little brothers melatonin to make them fall asleep early because she didn’t want to deal with them,"I was definitely abused by my stepmom and she blames me for the reason why she regrets having two more children (I know that isn’t my fault), so I’m worried if my own experiences with her are making my mind more biased when thinking about previous situations critically. 

She borderline hates my littlest brother, who’s 5 and has autism. Though, my dad and her refuse to recognize that. He’s incredibly hard to take care of sometimes, especially with being put to bed. So, in the past when my father and I were still living with her- I remember her giving my little brothers (the 5 year old and his older brother, who’s 8 now) melatonin around 7 o’clock every night. She gave my autistic 5 year old brother and his older brother, who’s calm and quiet all the time, melatonin. 

At the time I didn’t think of it. My dad was definitely treating my little brother like trash sometimes by dragging him up the stairs and locking him in his room. I still feel guilty about not helping my little brother- but I didn’t think it was super obvious with my stepmom.

Is this normal? Is it normal to give your kids melatonin super early to make them fall asleep, not when they’re sick and having troubles falling asleep? I’m still on the fence about it. I just think it’s incredibly suspicious considering how *tired* of her kids she was at the time I lived there. 

If it is abuse, what the hell do I do? I can’t talk to my dad about it considering how big of a piece of shit he is, I feel totally powerless. 

TLDR; is it normal for a person to give their kids melatonin every night even when they don’t technically need it? + suspicious with the morality of it due to my stepmom low key hating her kids",ryusuinanami,2020-03-23 18:46:25,3,337,21.39,57.08,67.59,2.4,18.72,15.73,90.8,54.9,21.66,16.62,9.2,0,0.3,5.64,1.48,5.04,3.56,11.28,8.31,8.01,6.53,2.37,17.21,6.82,1.78,3.26,1.78,1.78,7.42,2.37,5.04,1.19,2.08,0.59,16.91,3.56,0,3.56,5.64,13.95,4.15,2.37,1.78,1.48,2.37,3.26,1.48,0,0.3,0.89,2.37,1.19,1.19,0,0,5.93,2.37,0.89,2.08,0.3,0.59,3.86,11.57,0,14.54,1.19,5.04,8.31,0,0,0.59,0,0.59,0,1.19,0.59,0.3,0,0,0,15.73,3.56,3.26,0,0.3,1.19,0,0.89,0,4.45,1.19,0.89
fnwvyb,am i abused? (sorry this is so long),"i don’t know if i’m being over dramatic or i actually have a problem. i’m sorry if this offends anyone. i just genuinely want to know if i’m just being moody and dramatic or not.

i told my mom i was feeling depressed (i’m a teenager) and she got mad at me, saying i didn’t look sad and i was just dramatic. she told me she had it so much worse and i have no problems in life. she started telling me that her mother was awful and i had nothing to complain about. the school found out i was engaging in self harm once and they called my parents who were really mad at me. they didn’t hit me but they yelled a lot and told me not to talk to my friends anymore. she also nitpicks a LOT and always tells me that i’m doing something wrong. she also does this weird thing where she acts like a child that needs attention. she talks in this baby voice and i don’t know, i guess it’s supposed to be cute or something. but she really wants me to hug her. whenever i do she literally squeals with joy and hugs me for like 5 minutes and it just makes me uncomfortable. i tried to tell her to stop but she guilt tripped me about it or she just ignores me and acts very strict and cold. she gets mad very easily and i’m scared of talking to her sometimes because i don’t know if she’s mad or not. she also likes to embarrass me in public (there was one period where i felt so bad about myself that i didn’t have the energy to brush my teeth and i got a few cavities and she just tells everyone that and i told her i was embarrassed and she got upset). 

my dad yells at me a lot if i don’t listen to him. he wants to micromanage everything that i do and be in control of a lot of my actions. if i try to stand up for myself he’ll yell at me. i just find it really irritating but i don’t think it’s a big deal. he yells a lot and threatens to hit me a lot but never actually does. he raises his hand in front of my face but he doesn’t hit me so much anymore. he used to though. when i tell him i’m upset by something he did he just laughs at me and doesn’t take me seriously. i keep telling him i’m upset and he just keeps laughing. my parents don’t forget things either. they always tell me i’m irresponsible because from third grade to my freshman year i struggled with getting my homework done on time, but they still use that against me (i’m only a sophomore now but i haven’t forgotten a single homework assignment). 

it could just be me though because i am rebellious and i talk back to them a lot. i can be really rude at times. when they tell me to do something i don’t really listen and have a habit of not doing what they tell me to. i could be a nicer kid, it’s not like i’m entirely innocent in this too.

i don’t know if i’m being abused because there’s a lot of days where they’re so nice and everything’s just normal and things are good. they do a lot for me. i know they care about me and they do a lot of nice things. but there’s moments like this that make me question it. i don’t want to walk around thinking i’m being abused if i’m not.",raspberriesyeet,2020-03-23 19:06:12,3,623,2.04,14.1,67.69,1,16.39,11.56,98.07,67.58,28.09,21.83,14.61,0,0,5.46,1.77,6.26,3.37,9.95,12.2,8.19,10.59,3.85,23.11,3.69,1.12,1.28,0.8,2.57,9.15,2.57,6.58,1.77,2.41,0.64,14.61,0.96,0.16,3.85,2.25,16.69,2.57,1.44,2.73,5.3,1.28,6.9,2.57,0.16,1.61,0.8,0.64,0.48,0.16,0,0,5.14,0.8,0.48,1.77,1.12,1.12,4.98,15.89,0.48,7.87,0.48,4.01,3.53,1.12,0.48,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.96,5.78,0.64,0,0,0.16,0,0,0,6.1,1.28,0

fnz00j,Abused by my father,"I’ve been emotinally and verbally abused by my father for 4 years before before it came to an end. I need an advice.

My dad was a gambling addict, he got us into 40k debt (i come from poor family with an income of 20k after rent of his buisness and I live in canada). I tried helping him And everyday he would scream at me to go work and grow up (i was 15 when it started and i legally couldn’t even work). This would get me emotionally crying (which i never showed or let my friends or family feel it and cried every singleday for over 1000 days at the least). I was hoping that when i become 16 i can start working and help him out but my grades were great and my mother said ignore him and keep studying. The fact that i am a hypertension patient made the situation worse for me.

Last year it was the worst year of abuse before it ended. I ended up failing 9/12classes (also the year in which i started college) and was kicked out. Instead of studying i was thinking about how bad is our family situation and maybe i should leave the family and i passed my time thinking about death all day long. I even tried suiciding twice but was saved by random guys which I wish i could meet them and thank them. 

It was last year’s july when my mother saw me crying (this was where i couldn’t hold my emotions) and she proceeded to scream at my father who saw me crying too

He asked me to forgive him and that he really didn’t mean that and he was stressed. I pretended to refuse his apology. His health deteriorated soo fast for the next couple days (he didn’t go to work for couple days and he could barely move and whenever he walked, his legs were trembling). I later told him that i forgive him and he started to get better.

I ended up applying part time to another college and i got good grades last semester. This semester i am holding a 100% average in 4/6 classes and top in 5 classes (over 90% on all of them). My bad grades are still in my record. I want to go talk to my doctor about this situation which affected my grades and he can maybe give me medical paper explaining the issue. It is veryyyy clear that I was going through the pain: no one have baldness genetics in my family( my father whos 50 dont have it) and i’ve experienced severe hairloss and a person can’t simply be the worst student at one semester and them be a great student the next.

My question is if i tell my doctor about this situation, can my father be in trouble? I really know for a fact that he didn’t mean that and he was just an ignorant since his apology was real and have not say anything similar since then. I don’t want him to get hurt but telling this story to my doctor opens up my opportunity to apply for a more competitve study field.

Sorry for this long text and I didn’t really correct my errors since I was in hurry.

fo110p,Is my dad an abuser?,"Is my dad an abuser?

Hello! I’ll be introducing myself for a bit and then ill get right to the story

Im Daniel, i am 13 years old and i live in The Netherlands.
My parents divorced when i was 8 and since then i have bin seeing my dad every other weekend.
My dad has had a woman before my mom and is now in an on and off relationship with my stepmom.
My mother has a really nice boyfriend, he is really kind and supports me allot.

I also suffer from some stuff, i’ll be telling this here. (so you can maybe understand why i think certain ways or act certain ways)

I have:
Adhd,
Autism,
High-functioning depression,
Social anxiety,
And Dcd,

I am also handicapped, that does not really matter. I am diagnosed with all of these and im currently being tested on Bipolar and Dysphoria.

The “story”

I was born in 2006, my parents never really got along, i don’t even know why they got married and had me to be honest. The only thing i can remember from when they were together is fights, always fighting, non stop. I would try to sleep but i would hear screaming, stuff breaking and physical fights, my dad would get mad at EVERYTHING. If we didnt do the dishes on time, if my mom didnt cook the food exactly how he wanted, if we bought bread (or anything else) from a different brand / store, it was honestly so dumb.
He was always right. ALWAYS. If we tried to correct him he’d get mad and say he’s smarter, especially smarter than me cause im a child.
He would never do anything wrong, if i yelled he would be PISSED, if he yelled it was completely fine, my mom could not cuss at him or he would explode, same for my stepmom, but my dad cusses them out ALLOT, here are some examples: Bitch, Dumb fuck, *dutch slurs*, slut, useless, fat etc etc.

After my mom and dad had a divorce i could NEVER tell anything that happened at my dad, if i did and he would know he would scream at me, lock me in my room without food, water or entertainment and leave me there for some hours, i would tell that to my mom and my mom would email my dad asking him to stop, when i got back it would just happen again and again.
He used to call me fat and stupid, ‘cause of that i tried not to eat for 3 months and tried to puke anything up i ate. 
He also has threatened me a couple of times, examples: 
“If you do *something* you will never go with us on vacation anymore!”
“If you get a vaccine you are not allowed in this house anymore!” (I got the vaccination anyway and still came there) 
“If you dont come live with me you’re half sister will never love you!” ( i have a half sister who is a couple months old)
Etc etc. 
He is very racist and homophobic, he used to tell me that all lgbtq+ people are sick and should either get locked away or be given medicine ( i was a closeted Transgender male back then) he would be really rude to darker skinned people, saying the n word, calling them ugly, smelly, useless, lazy and so on.

He also almost got arrested for having some sort of weed plantage in his garage, he illegally used the city’s electricion for this. Eventually it got discovered and no one was allowed in there anymore and be had a sign on his garage, he would tell me it was for curing some sort of cancer with oils.

He would tell me that my mom is stupid and dumb and that she is the reason why in transgender and have some issues, even tho he did the most damage to me (i got bullied allot) he would tell me that i will never be a real man, that he would never call me Daniel and that he would cut my chest binder up ( a chest binder js what some people wear to flatten their chests) 

There have bin multiple times where i nicely texted my dad saying i would rather not come that one weekend and stay home, he would keep pushing me telling me “this is unfair, ill see you friday 😘” and i kept saying no, when i would later come he would get mad at me and lock me up again.

A couple weeks ago was the last thread, and i have refused to go to my dad anymore, im sick of everything he did to me, i started believing i could never open up to someone, that im fat and useless, that im sick for being part of the lgbtq+ community and that i should (tw) kill myself, i have had problems with (tw) self harm and suicidal thought, i have tried to kill myself twice.
Now im in self isolation cause of Covid -19 and cant see my dad, and to be honest.. these have bin the best days of my LIFE, i feel so much better now that im not seeing him. 

I have a therapist, and i told her about everything and she was shocked, she told me to write it all down on a paper and they got it to child protection, my mom had a meeting with them and they said its very dangerous for me and for my half sister, they want to have a meeting with my dad and me to see if i still wanna go and what they will do with the info.

My mom is very supportive of me, when i came out the first thing she did is was grab a piece of paper and  write “i love Daniel” instead of my birthname, she tries to call me by my pronouns and my chosen name, she has bought all my binders and is very helpfull when im feeling down, i love her so much.

The UK is now in lockdown meaning I am stuck at home and can only go out once or twice a day. My dad is working from home and my mum returns to work next week.

I have no idea how I’m meant to stay at home for the next 3 weeks minimum without falling apart. I have no relatives for 100 miles (all of whom are already in isolation) so have no choice but to stay at home.

They’re trying to control my every move and I don’t know what I’m meant to do. As an adult I can’t call anyone on them because it’s not the same as if a child was suffering.

fo3tvh,Is this friend abusive? (TW: Suicide mentions),"I have wanted to get this off my chest for a while. I don't know how to deal with it and I'm having nightmares and anxiety about it at 4:30am making it difficult for me to sleep. 

For context, this friend and I have a long history together. I won't give the story of our friendship as that would take way too long. However, just note he was a strong emotional support on my end during high school and early college. But after my junior year our relationship seemed to have fallen at the seams. Here is some things that made me question if he's abusive or not: 
1) he lied to me about attempting suicide. It's not that he was going to attempt suicide and back out of it. He literally told me he drank poison when he didn't and never intended to. He lied about it for attention and admitted it. 
2) we tried being romantic at one point, and as a first date he decided that we should go to a city 3 hours away from where we lived and spend a night there. When I told him I wasn't emotionally ready he guilt tripped me by saying he needed to get a break from his relatives. 
3) I attempted suicide shortly after this trip, and he got mad at me and blamed it on our trip, when I had been going to counseling for a month at that point because I was feeling suicidal after my friend died. 
4) My grandma and I got into an argument he witnessed and my grandma wasn't listening to me. In a fit of mental instability I screamed and blacked out. I was really scared of what happened as I lost control. Rather than trying to console me, he got really angry at me and threatened to make me pay him financial retribution because he invited me to all these various fun things and I grew up poor I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. 
5) he was jealous of my partner and I when we first got together. On my first Christmas with my partner he bought me a game system specifically in hopes of giving me the ""beat Christmas present"" even though he knew I couldn't afford to actually play games on it because I was unemployed back then and I was never enough of a gamer to spend the money I did have on it. He specifically got that gift to one-up my partner. 
6) he makes me feel weird and ashamed of my religion. I don't usually try to shove my religion down his throat, but I am pagan, so I worship deities from older religions and the Earth. He thinks I suddenly stopped being a Pagan just because I found faith and power in the older deities years down the line. He thinks I ""lost myself"" when really this is the most spiritual I have been in years. 
7) he goes on rants about how I've gotten changed for the worse over the years and tells me I'm stubborn and don't listen to him. He gets defensive and claims he will ""never bother me again"" in a guilt tripping way if I ever show him a bit of backbone. 
8) I felt suicidal one day. I was trying to keep something about it private but he could tell something was wrong so he kept pushing for me to tell him. I'm a bad liar and a quick tell so I told him what bothered me. He got extremely angry at me and made me imagine what it would be like if the person whose secret I blew to him has been revealed to anyone else. Then he got more upset which his anger made me feel a lot worse. My therapist told me to never trust him with anything that personal again and not go to him when I feel suicidal. I called the person whose trust i breached, genuinely expecting her to disown me. Instead, she expressed mild disappointment but treated me with immense kindness and understanding.

fo4kt6,I Just want to help my brother,"I’m nineteen now and I’ve endured an entire lifetime of my fathers verbal and mental abuse. He hasn’t put his hands on me since i was little but he likes to just scream at the top of his lungs in your face, and all you can really do is sit there and listen while he screams really mean and hurtful things at you. Things about how you make his life more stressful, you make him want to blow his own head off, you’re stupid, you’re fat, you’re disgusting, you’re embarrassing, etc. Everything a father should not say to his kid. Every single day. I grew up and I’m past it, I’ve learned how to cope with it. However, this quarantine is going to be living hell for my little brother.

Now that I’m older, my dad can’t get away with talking to me like that so all the focus goes to my 11 year old brother. It makes me feel sick and I want to cry every time I hear him saying these awful things to him. Any little mistake he makes, whether it be taking too long to do something, or messing up schoolwork - it doesn’t matter how small it is. My dad will SCREAM at him, in his face, and he’s defenseless and I can’t help. I’ve stepped in a few times and told my dad to calm down, stop yelling, he’s just a kid, etc but it seems all it does is make him yell more.

God i just want him to stop screaming at him. I love my brother so much, we’re all the other has. And seeing the tears in his eyes and knowing how hard he’s trying to hold them in until my dad is done screaming just breaks my fucking heart. My brother knows I’m here for him because after every screaming fit, I go over and comfort him and let him cry on my shoulder. I tell him i hate dad too, I hate the way he treats him, and one day we’ll get out of here. The problem is, I can only tell him to ignore it but you really really can’t when he’s in your face calling you every insult you should get from school bullies. 

I don’t know what to do. I know the abuse I went through RUINED my mental state, and I know my brother can see how depressed and unstable our dad made me. I just don’t want that for him. His mom is never around, my mom never was either, and our dad is so fucking unlikeable that family is distant from us entirely. 

All the money I’ve been trying to save to one day get and apartment and get us the fuck out is going to be used to sustain us during quarantine...

I’m tired of waking up at eight am every day to hear my brother get berated over taking too long to complete a survey before his online schooling began. I’m tired of my dad coming home and pretending to be dad of the year, playing and joking around, just to get angry at the smallest thing and yell again. It’s confusing to a child, its somehow NOT exhausting to him. Every day this man finds a new way to make us feel like shit. 

My poor little brother doesn’t deserve the childhood I had. I’m so afraid knowing he’s already been too abused to grow up normally, I don’t want him going down my path",bromericunt,2020-03-24 05:50:57,5,591,19.15,69.41,48.75,1,19.7,11,95.6,58.38,23.18,18.78,9.14,1.35,2.2,5.92,0.17,4.4,3.21,13.2,10.32,6.77,7.11,2.2,22.5,4.91,1.69,1.35,1.02,3.38,8.12,1.18,6.94,0.68,2.71,1.02,16.75,3.72,0,0.34,9.31,13.54,2.2,2.54,1.86,1.35,2.88,3.05,3.72,0.51,2.37,0.85,3.55,1.86,1.18,0.51,0.17,8.8,3.38,0.51,3.38,1.52,0.51,2.54,17.26,1.02,14.21,1.86,7.11,5.25,0.68,0.51,0.51,0.34,0.34,0,0.85,0.85,0,0,0,0,15.57,5.08,4.91,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,5.41,0,0

fo7g9f,I don’t know who I am anymore,"Do I even exist anymore?

Hi there, this is a long one.

To start with I’m seriously depressed, had to go to A&amp;E to have them look at my self injury in case of infection from my last meltdown. But yeah, I’m pretty toxic to be around sometimes and I’d rather just not be around people you know- I have ASC and my partner is also my carer. Sometimes my meltdowns are quite scary, I do scream and hurt myself and say things I regret. I’m not perfect, but I want to try to minimise the triggers that set me off, and if I can’t minimise, it’s an effort of trying to get used to it (for instance I cooked dinner completely alone yesterday for the first time and only felt anxious for about half the time, a win for me)
I’m also in my final year of art school, and given all that’s happening in the world, my course hasn’t been able to come up with an alternative yet for our final exam. But I’m also preparing for a hand in for Tuesday next week- I’m bloody busy and all he seems to care about is whether I’m giving him attention. And I just can’t give him 24/7 attention. 
We are together all the time, literally. 
50-70% of the time I visit my mum (as she is the last person to grow tired of the arguments we inevitably have) which is once a month/bi-monthly, we argue to the point of no return. 
I don’t have any friends anymore to offload some steam on, all my friends are essentially his friends and I don’t talk to them much, I’m just too depressed and probably will talk about him and that’s unfair really.
I don’t find he enjoys much of my interests, we only share in his interests. It’s hard to enjoy anything when the only person you spend time with is so negative about the stuff you actually like. So I just don’t bother.
He constantly misgenders me and doesn’t bother to apologise. Just looks at me like I’m meant to save the day.
Last night he directly challenged whether “I love pussy” as that was the last line of Half-baked- “I know I can say I LOOVE PUSSAY, can you?” when I know I hate being vulgar like that and would never say I loooooove dick. 
He seems to be in some kind of denial about my sexual history because I was sexually assaulted by my first boyfriend, which kind of kickstarted this slutty behaviour in me, and for years I was in drink, drugs and mutilation to cope with it all. He seems to think that I love genitals, which like I’m sorry who literally looks at any genitals and is like phwoar. It’s just weird. 
I know I am constantly in this cloud of doubt because at the beginning of our relationship he gave me the ultimatum to tell him every aspect of my sexual history to deem whether he could be with me (I’ve slept with way more people than he has and his morals were very different. He very plainly slut shamed me and because I’d been assaulted twice, that made him seriously consider whether he wanted to be with me- he thought I was disgusting and he let me know that) that was 3 years ago and it was a constant thing where I was just chasing him to prove that I wanted to be with him and now I just feel like he sees me as a cis heterosexual woman. 

When I’m not, I’ve changed how I come across or just lie sometimes to save face with him because it’s like being with my homophobic family sometimes, just completely insensitive. He expects me to just be this normal thing and all I keep thinking is whether I, my identity even does exist. Whether I am myself anymore. 
I don’t like anything anymore, I don’t do anything I used to enjoy, I feel like a constant disappointment and have no dreams or goals of the future.
I don’t even sleep well, nightmares every night and wake up really early and have nowhere to go because we live in an overcrowded houseshare. I spent most mornings staving off my tears because I have no privacy to cry them. 
We can’t move out because he doesn’t work and I’ve spent all my savings I made before my depression and anxiety got worse to give us a start beginning to the relationship- some meals, takeaways, little trips into London- I’ve never had a proper relationship with someone not ashamed to talk to me. So I wanted to put my all in... feel stupid now because I have nothing to show for it. 
He’s not the worst person I’ve met at all, but sometimes I just can’t help but think what do I get out of this- like I don’t exactly feel great most of the time, and I don’t even know if he understands me, but I don’t know what to think or feel anymore, just seems like whatever I do is the wrong thing.

fo97md,i think i was sexually assaulted.,"back when i was 15 (i’m now 17) i was in a relationship with a guy who i’ll call T. This relationship ended up being very toxic, (admittedly both of us bounced off each other a bit) but he ended up being very controlling and manipulative in MANY ways. i often (but not always) felt pressured into sexual activity, sometimes i would say i didn’t want to and t would stop but then would try again not long after. he used to make me kiss him and would hold my head in place so i wouldn’t stop kissing him even when i didn’t want to, then he’d get offended if i wasn’t interest and would get upset so i would comply. when at my house, if we were with family he would complain of a headache or something, but would refuse painkillers and insist that we sat in the other room where he would try stuff with me. he also used to try stuff while we were around other people so i felt like i couldn’t say no because that would draw attention to it etc... once we were done he would often apologise to me because i’d said i didn’t want it and i would forgive him because i thought that was okay. One time i felt particularly anxious about all of this so i messaged him saying that i was feeling used and anxious, and he kicked off at me and made me feel awful for even suggesting anything. Since then i have repeatedly questioned whether or not any of it even happened or if i’m just making it up/ it was my own fault for not being clear about it. 

since then i have REALLY withdrawn from any sexual activity, and ended up feeling anxious and panicky on the few occasions i’ve tried to be intimate with people (no more than 4 times in the last year and a half). usually it doesn’t affect me day to day, but today it just really hit me and i felt on the verge of a panic attack. i just need clarity, and advice.",bigtittibitch,2020-03-24 10:34:12,19,360,7.51,15.86,88.02,3.92,27.69,13.06,95,64.44,21.39,15.28,10.56,1.39,0,3.33,0,6.11,2.78,12.22,11.39,8.06,11.67,3.61,22.22,2.78,1.11,1.67,1.67,2.5,5,1.39,3.61,1.94,0.83,0,10,0.28,0.28,0,3.61,23.89,3.33,4.17,5.83,5,1.11,7.22,3.33,0.28,1.11,1.94,1.67,0.28,0.56,0.83,0,8.61,3.06,1.11,3.06,0.56,0.83,9.17,6.39,1.39,16.11,0,6.67,9.72,0,0.28,0.83,0,0,0,0.28,0,0,0.28,0,0,12.78,4.17,2.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.61,2.22,0.28
foanga,"I am an abuser, suicidal, self involved prick...","I've never really done anything like this before. Signed up to reddit because I've seen people getting help on here... 

I've been married a year been with my partner for nearly 6. We have the children... not with each other; biological daughter 8yo, step daughter 8 yo, step son 11yo. 

We have an average hectic life. My daughter is on the autistic spectrum,  my step son as well. So family life can seem tough sometimes. But genuinely I love them so much. They're funny,  bright kids.


I am also on the ASD spectrum,  have OCD, severe depressive bouts, suicidal thoughts and anxiety My wife is a recovering alcoholic with suspecting narcissism. We communicate openly about our issues but I still can't get a handle on my obsessive thoughts.  They're intrusive but somehow comfortable... they lead to full meltdowns.
My meltdowns include me repeating myself,  hitting my own head, pulling my hair out,  hitting walls, screaming, shouting,  breaking things... worst of all I have grabbed, pushed,  pulled the hair of my wife. 

I understand these behaviours of mine are completely wrong in every way... I have always struggled with anger, although never really been in any fights other than with family mens. I'm quite a passive person in my every day life,  whether this is a mask or not I'm not sure. 
I  get overwhelmed by situations and struggle to get myself out of them. I can't handle loud or busy situations,  social situations in general especially those that are spontaneous cause stress... most of all I struggle with doing things wrong that would make my wife dislike me, whether these are perceived or real... I have meltdowns over these and our escalates... in turn causing more damage to our relationship than what I may or may not have done before hand...

I'm scared that I have ruined my relationship beyond repair. While she does have her faults, she can be very domineering,  controlling, belittling of how I feel,  she does say things like you don't understand because you're autistic... I know she's trying very hard:  she's a good mum,  self aware,  seeking help for herself, loving, intelligent,  accomplished... she is growing as a person. 

I on the other hand am I self involved piece of shit, i struggle to grow,  I'm too much of a coward to seek help,  I'm abusive,  i have overwhelming thoughts about killing myself, I don't feel good enough at anything,  although academically okay I've never really accomplished anything. 
The only thing I have going for me internally is that I am trying to be a good dad. 

It's got to the point where I'm pretty sure that everyone would be better off without me, the social thoughts when I'm in a panic have got to the point where I'm grabbing knives and turning them towards myself... I think it's only a matter of time before I do end up killing myself.  

I really don't want to harm my family, I really don't want to harm my wife,  I don't want her to be scared of me, I doubt want her to feel scared. 

I don't know what I'm looking for...

fof0mr,Should I be doing more or anything at all?,"When I was 17 years old I was raped by my abuser. The whole relationship I emotionally and sometimes physically abused. Thankfully I was able to get out of it and haven’t had contact with him in over two years. After having my own therapist and acknowledging that this indeed happened to me, I was finally able to speak up. I was able to tell my few close friends, my sister, and my parents know a bit.

I haven’t told anyone that I’m casual friends with or made a large post or anything because I just feel too uncomfortable putting my story out there especially three years after it all happened. I worry about how people would react or how my abuser and his friends would react.

Lately I have seen photos of him on my timeline on twitter or sometimes snapchat because of the few mutual friends we have. 

Sometimes I feel guilty about not telling those people. I feel guilty that these people are hanging out and smiling in a picture with a man that raped me. I worry that my abuser will meet another girl or boy and possibly harm them again.

Then, after i say that, my dad comes in and starts screaming about how he did nothing and im a spoiled brat and im lying and shit.

fokja6,Abused by stepmom,"I don’t know where to start. 

I’m in my early 30s.
My father married my now deceased step mother when I was four. 

One of my earliest memories of her was her hitting me with my hair brush.

As the years went by her abuse towards me progressed; every time she did my hair for school I was beat with a hairbrush, dragging me by the ear lobes, kicking me, hitting me with a broom (this turned into a bad relax where I would flinch when she would walk by me). 

I hated avocados as a young girl and there was a time she had put them into our salad. I asked my dad if I could not eat them bc avocados made me feel sick. He said I could give them to him and so I did. The next morning as I was prepping my breakfast she told me I would not be having cereal and pulled out a bowl of sliced avocado and made me eat it. I threw up and she made me eat it what was in the bowl-She ended up taking the bowl away because I was crying so much. I was 6 or 7 at this time. 

She would makes comments about how my mother was a whore and that no wanted me. She hated my mother let me know everyday.

After school she kept me in my room and I wasn’t allowed to do anything besides side in the middle of the floor. Then when my dad would pull up in drive way she would yell that i could come out of my room. 

As this was going on, my step brother who is a year older starting touching me and wanting to experiment with kissing and touching. That’s all it ever was and nothing more. I don’t think it’s molestation if we are the same age? And we both consented...I mean, really, we didn’t know what was happening or how to channel it as our parents NEVER talked about sex with us. We stopped before I started puberty and never brought it up. He’s never tried anything on me since and is remorseful. So in total maybe from 5 years old to 10 years old. 

My father was extremely abusive towards him: verbally and psychologically, while my step mom physically, verbally and psychologically abused me. 

Her abuse went from 4/5years old to 11 years old. 

My father knew, as there were several instances: there was a time she threw a glass pickle jar at him from the kitchen. I told my god parents and they spoke with my dad. My father interrogated me about it like I was lying. 

The second is when she beat me with a hanger and cut open the top of my head-I remember the blood dripping down onto the carpet and I was so confused. She immediately stopped and grabbed a was cloth and cleaned the carpet and my clothes then continued to put gel in my hair and brush it to put it in ponytail-on a fresh wound this isn’t ideal. I told my friends at school and my mom when I saw her that weekend (every other weekend I was with her). I can’t remember if my dad told anything to my step mom as I don’t remember being interrogated from this. I was in the 2nd grade when this happened. 

The third was when she was kicking me in the morning before school as she always did. They were hard kicks also. I had to take out all the trash in the morning and place them into large trash bin and while I was do so I worked up the courage to run to my grandparents house and bang on their door. My grandfathered asked where she had kicked me and I couldn’t provide proof of a bruise. My grandmother went there and chewed her out. I stayed with my grandmother after school that day and my father came to pick me up and said if this happens again that I need to tell him and not get other ppl involved. No hug no nothing. I was in 6th grade at this time. 

After she died my father stopped speaking to me as did my 2 half sisters. She died of cancer 3 years ago. She apologized to me on her death bed when everyone was out of the room. My half sister says I made the whole thing up and disinvited me from her wedding. They stopped speaking to my step brother because there were major fights after she died and they want nothing to do with him. 

I need to know I’m not alone and this is the FIRST time I am putting this out onto the web to gain clarity and peace. 
I am engaged to a wonderful man I’ve been with for 10 years. He is amazing and has helped me through it all. BUT it’s difficult to release all she has done to me to him. 
So I am here and need advice on how to cope when memories resurface. 
Thank you.",nenetl10,2020-03-24 22:00:55,4,861,26.52,39.01,83.92,10.93,16.56,12.66,93.03,61.79,23.23,18.82,12.31,0.81,0.12,4.53,1.05,4.41,4.53,14.29,8.94,4.76,9.18,2.44,19.74,3.83,2.56,2.09,1.86,1.39,3.48,1.16,2.32,0.12,1.16,0.35,13.24,3.25,0.12,4.76,2.79,10.22,1.51,1.74,2.56,1.28,2.21,2.09,1.86,0.12,0.93,0.81,1.97,0.46,0.46,0.23,0.81,5.57,2.09,0.93,1.86,0.46,0.7,9.99,6.74,0.35,18.12,2.9,7.08,8.25,1.16,0.46,1.16,0,0.12,0.58,0.35,0.12,0.23,0,0,0,10.34,6.16,1.05,0.23,0.12,0.12,0,0.35,0,1.74,0.46,0.12
foppi9,afraid of being stuck,"Hi

On a throwaway bc I need to be honest about things here.
Like countless ppl I don't want to be in lockdown but there's nothing to do about it.

I need to go to bed soon so I don't know why I'm posting this but I just don't want to wake up tomorrow and go through everything.
I live in this morbid reality with my mental illnesses and it's so hard. But what is really scaring me right now is being stuck in lockdown with my parents. 
Today I confronted my dad about something and I know that my mental problems may be have messed with my perception of reality.
But he reacted as I knew he would. The whole family was against me. My mum would not leave me alone afterward and there was a lot of verbal and mental abuse. 

I'm so scared that I'll be trapped in my problems forever. But worse is not being able to control my environment. Standing up for myself means verbal bashings from my mother, her storming into my room countless times everyday to lecture and scream at me, my possessions being chucked away, 'accidents' happening, rubbish been thrown in my room. You get the picture.

Then there's dad- with his mocking laughter, gaslighting and psychological abuse.
He can look you right in the face, smile, look like a loving holy figure and the most kind-hearted person and say 'I never abused you, ever' with 100% conviction.

I don't know what to do. Helplines in my country can only *help* so much, and tbh I feel that ppl who have tried cant seem to understand the full picture.

I have so many delusions and anxiety issues that I often cant function, then when I call helplines they suggest moving out etc.
I wish someone cared about me as a person, not a statistic.

I'm not looking for a magical solution here, but if anyone has made it through with seemingly impossible odds and being able to get out of an abusive environment while battling 'mental' problems, I would love to have a bit more hope. 

I think I will try to sleep tonight but I am really scared what  tomorrow will bring :/

I just hope my dad doesn't do certain things which he knows I find uncomfortable and get triggered by.",throwaway24665,2020-03-25 05:48:42,4,396,21.34,15.62,83.18,3.73,18,17.68,91.92,59.09,19.44,14.14,11.62,0,0.76,1.52,0.25,5.3,3.28,13.38,11.11,6.57,8.33,3.28,20.96,4.8,1.77,1.77,0.25,1.77,7.32,2.53,4.8,1.52,1.77,0.25,8.33,1.77,0,0.76,2.02,16.92,3.79,1.77,3.79,3.28,1.77,4.29,2.78,1.26,0.76,0.51,1.52,0.76,0.51,0,0,5.56,1.52,1.26,1.26,0.76,1.01,2.53,15.66,3.28,12.37,1.52,6.31,4.55,0.51,0.25,1.01,0,0.25,0,1.26,0,1.26,0,0,0,14.39,5.3,3.28,0,0,0,0,0.51,0,4.55,0,0.76
fouodd,My life with my abusive mother,"My entire life I have been plagued by my abusive gaslighting mother. She has never failed to find a way to turn everything into my fault since I was a child. When I was young I never understood it so I always thought it was my fault. At school I would always be told how good of a student I was. In private I would have temper tantrums and destroy all my toys. I would purposely bug my mom so that she would scream at me. Because of these behaviors I have grown up struggling with self sabotage and self harm. I am impossibly hard on myself which is so hard to deal with especially when I’m self aware to it. As the years went on my super supportive kind father passed away. Leaving me with her. She will constantly blame everything on me and gaslight me every single day. It’s the way she words things as if I’m stupid or incompetent. As if nothing I say matters and I’m always wrong. Then, for one day or two she’ll be kind and act nice. Then go right back to being nasty. She will guilt trip me whenever she buys anything for me so I refuse to have her buy anything for me in fear that she’ll just use it against me. But instead of being afraid of her as time goes on, I get angry. I have rage attacks where I throw things and punch the walls or myself. I scream at her and threaten her. Afterwards I feel bad but I can’t stop. She makes me so angry because I know her tactics but she just doesn’t listen. She turns it on me and it works. It hurts. I don’t know what to do or how to cope with my abuse anymore because as time goes on I see that I don’t deserve it. Unlike a lot of abuse victims I can’t help but stand up to my abuser. Because that’s just the person I am. And it gets me in trouble. It’s just so impossibly hard to take bullying from your mother your entire life and not eventually fight back. I am going off to college thankfully in the fall and I’m so close to getting away from her but things are hard. Due to coronavirus we have been home with one another which has led me to be relentlessly rageful. She will never stop screaming at me or nagging me every second and I hate her and I’m not afraid to say it. I guess I’m just hurt and losing my mind. I don’t want to feel alone so I decided to hop on here. I send my love and support to anyone struggling In a worse situation than me. I’m aware I have it better than some. Sending my love to everyone in an unhealthy home during this crisis. I wish you nothing but peace and healing. I apologize if this is annoying or has no end point. I just want to vent is all.

foypty,I feel so lost,"I think my parents may be abusive. My mom has told me before that I cry because I want things from her, told me that there’s something wrong with me, and that if I ever called the police on them they’d give away all my animals. She also has bursts of anger, where she lashes out (not physically) and it’s terrifying. She’s once gone from 20mph to full reverse while driving me to school because I was upset at her for some reason, I can’t quite remember. It triggered a panic attack and I was crying for a good while before they finally took me to school. Those are just the things that I know happened. There’s so much other stuff but it all seems like a nightmare now, I can’t distinguish what really happened and what didn’t. My dad has also threatened to hit me before, and when I told him I would report it he laughed and said the police wouldn’t care. Again, more things have happened I think but that’s just what I know for sure. They also keep a key to my room, and let themselves in whenever, sometimes when I’m asleep. I tend to sleep in just undergarments and I feel super uncomfortable about it, but they tell me it’s for my safety. They also go through my room and my trash periodically, and have tried to put trackers on my phone. I now have very bad nightmares that feel similar to what I felt when they yelled at me, and I’m scared to go to sleep. But they’re not bad parents. They feed me. They give me clothes and buy me stuff and tell me they love me, so I’m really not sure what to think anymore. They’ve been so nice the past few months but I can’t help but feel terrified when I’m around them.

She made me feel bad like I was mistreating her, so I would be like ok I'll give you another chance, and then I would just be sitting there on the couch and she would start kicking me in front of people. She pressured me into all sorts of sexual situations I was clearly not cool with, and it was like my whole head would jam up and I couldn't think or speak, She would be like I just want you to feel comfortable, but it felt way more like she was pressuring me to do stuff I didnt want to. I started to have to drink to be around her otherwise I was like sitting there just wanting to leave so badly but I couldnt get myself to move. I was afraid she was going to tell people I led her on, so I felt like I was trapped. It was so weird I could not ever tell her how I felt cause I was afraid she would berate me/get violent. It was a weird situation cause I know I had been abused way more severely by a previous ex who would like put cigs out on my arm, threaten to kill herself blah blah blah, so I feel like past experiences were contributing to the way I felt. In retrospect it did feel like some extreme manipulation.

fp1fcl,I'm leaving,"I have a plan and it's going to come to fruition. I've asked him, begged him, written out lists... I've done everything I could do to get him to stop yelling at me, insulting me, tearing me down, and destroying me... I don't know what shifted but something did. I have no desire to stay or try and force him to love me like I know deserve. 

Now, when he insults me it gives me strength. It reaffirms my will to leave. I used to cry and feel weak and hopeless... I used to think all I had to do was be better and do better. I just KNEW if I was a better wife and mother he wouldn't do the things he does to me... I now know there's nothing I will ever do to make him not treat me this way.

I am very hopeful that UBI becomes a constant thing because I'll be able to leave even sooner. But, until then, I just wanted someone to know that I'm doing this and I'm scared but so very excited. 

I know he won't try and fight me for the kids... He may out of anger or spite at first but I know he hates the responsibility. He hates having a family. He tells me it all the time... How he hates me and never wanted this life. How I forced it on him. I didn't force anything. He asked me to marry him and then told people he only married me because he felt obligated. He was mean to me at our wedding. He insulted me and bullied me hours after our children were born. 

He called me lazy and worthless after c-sections. He told me I had no right to feel overwhelmed when our babies clusterfed because I ""chose to do it"" and could ""just give them formula"" if it was too hard for me. That it was natural and other women did it all the time without whining about it. 

He calls me worthless and lazy when he wakes the baby up making noise and tells me I must hate our kids if I can't even be a mother for 5 minutes. I LOVE being a mother but sometimes it's nice to have them just lay down for a short nap while I do something else for a bit and they need naps when they're so little. They get cranky when the naos are interrupted. 

He says I'm dicking around everytime I try and do my school work for college. He's just mean. 

He doesn't take me on dates, he doesn't speak kindly to me, he forgets me on my birthday, our anniversary, and all other holidays... It just hurts me. And I used to think I could just force him to love me better if I stayed or if I stopped arguing back when he was mean or if I just didn't bring it up when he was hateful it would stop... It never will. 

And I hate the idea of breaking up my family... And I know he's going to call me a whore for leaving and say that I must be fucking other people (I have never slept with anyone else our while relationship so he has no reason to feel this way) or wanting to find someone else. 

I already do all the shopping, budgeting, bill paying, scheduling, and everything else. The only thing I'm lacking is his portion of the income and if we get UBI then ill be able to have everything in order... If not I just have a little longer left until infinish my degree and can get a nice paying job. 

I've started taking little steps each day to better my life for my kids and me and somehow, without realizing it, my journey has amounted to MILES! I can do this and I will.

Im excited to be alone with my kids. Im excited for the quiteness because he's not yelling at me. Im excited to go weeks without someone being mean to me. Im just very excited and hopeful. Nervous and saddened by the loss, definitely, but at this point the pain of leaving is FAR less than the pain of staying.",ConstipationKills,2020-03-25 17:12:05,3,710,5.7,26.78,75.87,5.88,14.79,12.96,96.34,64.79,25.63,19.58,12.82,0.99,0,5.21,0.56,6.06,3.66,10.56,12.25,6.06,10.42,2.96,23.38,4.93,1.69,1.41,0.28,1.13,8.03,3.1,4.93,0.42,2.54,1.27,13.94,1.55,0,0.7,5.21,16.48,3.24,2.25,3.24,3.94,2.39,5.07,2.25,0,0.99,1.13,1.83,0.14,0.85,0.28,0.14,9.44,2.39,2.25,2.54,2.39,0.7,5.07,14.79,2.25,12.54,2.11,4.65,6.2,1.41,0.85,0.28,0.85,0,0,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,0,16.62,9.3,2.82,0,0,0,0.14,0.14,0.56,3.38,0.28,0

My mom has this thing where she likes to grab one or both of my boobs, often out of nowhere, and laughs when I tell her it’s weird and she needs to stop. I’ve expressed this multiple times in front of multiple family members who are like, yeah, she should stop and don’t seem alarmed. She says it’s different because she’s not a guy.

I don’t want to think the worst, but it’s creeping me the hell out and I find it really disconcerting. I think it’s her way of asserting power over me. Kind of reminds me of gay dudes who grab women and justify it because they’re not attracted to them.

fp465i,"What kind of abuse, if it is abuse, is my boyfriend showing?","My boyfriend was nice too me until we had our baby. For 3 years he we good.

Things he does:
*He wont talk about anything. If I raise my voice, disagree, try to tell him how I feel he puts up his hand for me to stop talking. If I continue he will not talk to me any more. He will go upstairs and lock himself in our room. He says it's because talking about it only makes it worse and its adding fuel to the fire.

*He always has to be in control. He nags about how loud I walk. He wont let us speak too loud or walk too loud. Sometimes the baby cant even have toys because they're too loud. He nags about my parking. Unless I am perfectly within the lines he will complain. And when I mean perfect I mean I have to be right in between the lines. I not he will go on and on until I move the car (but I'm not allowed to leave the house once I have already come in because he thinks people will see and complain if om outside doing anything). I cant run the washer and dryer after night comes (around 5pm) and once I was running just the dryer and he went off for 10 minutes. We cant turn lights on after dark. Because he says people will see and purposely blast their music if we keep lights on. He doesnt like me drinking iced coffee so if he catches me he goes off for 5 minutes on how I will get diabetes from it. I try to tell him no one in my family has diabetes but he told me it doesnt matter (I don't get a lot of sugar in it either).

* Nothing is ever good enough. I am in housing now and I'm looking to find a mobile home. We went to see one today and I'm gonna get it if everything goes though. Even though I am the one looking and doing all the effort he refuses to be happy until I find a plot of land separate from everything. He wont stop talking about it. Nothing is good enough and will ever be until I find a plot of land. He told me he wont be able to let us be free (not exact words but free as in letting us turn on lights, walk normal, etc) until we have a plot of land. He wont help buy it or find it but he also wont sto talking about it. He tells me over and over....every.....single....day. I try to tell him I cant afford it but he told me ""it doesnt have to be a big plot"". 

* he never stops telling me I need to find jesus. Even when I was going to my church he told me my church was wrong and that I needed to read the bible and watch YouTube for god. He pounded and pounded it over and over again until I just dont believe in god anymore. I told him this and he told me ""I'm not responsible for your beliefs it's not my fault you dont love god but you dont wanna know what hell is like so you need to read the bible.

* he told me if I leave him the next guy is going to want me for sex only. That dont think that just because I'm not with him that I will find a good guy. Then the next day he will tell me ""you can find anyone, you think I dont know that? You're special.""

I was pretty sure this was abuse until a few months ago when i confided to my councilor what was happening and that I thought it was abuse. She told me maybe I wasnt understanding his culture and language (he puerto rican. Spanish is his first language) and misunderstanding what he meant and that I should try and work it out with him. 

Even if I did leave him I don't know how. I never left anyone before and I know he would blow it up and turn it on me. Everyone would hate me and I would have to deal with the repercussions of my leaving him. There wouldn't be a chance I'd be able to not look bad. The matter of the baby also. I would definitely be the prime caretaker but I'd have to deal with having to force his father to help me with him because he hasnt been willing to go out and take care of his other kids when they grew up (they're grown up). When they were little once he left their mothers he mostly washed his hands of them except for child support and a once and a while visit. I didnt know this before we had the baby. But that's all I can think of now. I'm not sure what to do, if I'm the problem or what.",4thasakeofanonymity,2020-03-25 20:12:33,5,846,7.84,47.16,61.13,29.73,16.27,9.22,95.15,65.13,24.94,19.27,9.57,1.42,0.83,6.86,0.59,5.67,3.66,12.41,12.06,5.56,9.81,4.49,23.64,2.84,1.18,1.77,1.42,1.18,4.14,2.13,1.89,0,0.95,0,16.43,0.83,0.47,0.24,7.33,15.48,2.96,1.77,2.6,3.43,2.25,5.2,3.07,1.42,1.06,0.47,1.18,0.24,0.35,0.12,0.35,8.16,2.48,1.3,2.36,1.42,0.95,4.14,16.31,2.48,14.42,3.55,4.96,5.91,0.71,0.83,0.59,0.35,1.18,0,0.35,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,13.48,7.45,0.95,0.12,0,0.24,0,0,0.59,2.13,1.42,0.59
fp60dv,"SURVEY: Self-Quarantine Risks &amp; Repercussions: Physical Safety, Mental Health, and Nonconforming Identities. [Help a Graduate Student with Research]","Hey guys! Since I know everyone is spending way too much time at home on the internet and hopefully feeling bored enough to complete a survey about the how the recently imposed self-isolation ordinances have impacted your interpersonal relationships, your identity, your safety, and your overall wellbeing - I thought I'd try to enlist the reddit community for help.

Has the recent global crisis worsened or caused mental health issues? Have quarantine measures forced you to be around potentially dangerous/abusive individuals whom share the same household? Have you had to move home and hide your sexuality or gender identity? Have social/economic disruptions threatened your safety? Have you been separated from loved ones or friends? This virus has caused alot of suffering  and I wanted to give people an anonymous outlet to share their story and thoughts (which will inspire research that can hopefully be used to start a conversation and shine a light on these issues). 

The survey data will be used for research purposes (unpublished graduate coursework in preparation for creating my thesis project) and since current research and mainstream media are purely concerned with economic or respiratory illness effects (therefore there are ZERO peer-reviewed journals to gain relevant information) - I thought I would try to utilize my own survey to try to understand some of the social/psychological symptoms of the current global crisis.


TAKE IT HERE: https://forms.gle/e4WjdsmvwHzopSm88



Read about it below:

Firstly,

THANK YOU! I appreciate your time &amp; effort to provide much need info regarding the sidelined conversations concerning recently imposed self-isolation ordinances. 


This survey will ask you questions regarding the impact of this current global crisis on your physical, mental, emotional, sexual, financial, psychological, and social wellbeing.


This research is for a graduate seminar course and will not be published. I am hoping to further investigate this topic for my future thesis project. The purpose of this survey is to provide a preliminary understanding surrounding the traumas and trials of people existing outside of the media's current attention - since there are currently no supplementary publications on this topic thus yet, I figured I'd try to gather some of my own data.


Secondly,

Please note that this survey is 100% ANONYMOUS. If you choose to email me outside of the survey, all of your personal information will be kept private.


Thirdly,

Please feel free to skip ANY question that doesn't pertain to you or makes you feel uncomfortable. You can answer as many or as few questions as you so choose.


Thank you again for being willing to share your story!


Fourthly,

SHARE THIS SURVEY! Again, there isn't ANY academic information currently available on this topic which means people are suffering in silence while the world's attention is elsewhere. There are many more ways this virus can hurt people than just causing a respiratory infection. The topics discussed in this survey are an extremely important part of maintaining a 'healthy population' and hopefully the more popular this gets - the more visible it becomes.


Thank you!

fpbyky,Mocked for crying — is this abuse?,"I turned 27 yesterday. I’ve been sad all day. (My job catfished me and has me sitting down answering phones all day when they said they wanted me to use my education to write and do marketing.)

I hold it in and break down crying in front of my mom, who rolls her eyes, huffs, puffs, sighs, and then yells at me to “quit and live in a homeless shelter.” This makes me sadder since it’s my birthday. 

The whole night she mocks me and raises her voice and says I ruined her night because it’s not fun. But it’s my birthday. 

I told her I wanted to die and she called me pathetic. We ended up doing nothing for my birthday.

fpca3g,I (23F) need help/advice on getting my older brother (29M) kicked out of my parents (55F) and (62M) house,"Long back story,

My brother is an abusive, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, piece of shit. He treats my parents like garbage and has been abusive to me since childhood. Some examples of his behavior will be included below. 

My parents for some reason continuously tolerate his absolutely disgusting behavior and foul mouth. Recently my mother admitted to me she is afraid of him. She didn’t state why, but I am genuinely worried for the sake of her mental health and safety now. I’ve worried for myself as well since he has gotten physical with me in the past, but I care more about my mom at this point. She doesn’t have the courage to kick him out since she was pushed out of her home at 18, I think she empathizes too much and is scared of putting him in a rough situation. The thing is, he is turning 30 in 4 months, has never once lived on his own, and has been living rent-free since he graduated. He can definitely afford to move out, he makes more money than both of my parents and has around $30,000 in his savings account. My parents told me that if I wanted to continue living at home after high school I needed to find a job and pay rent or go to college. Currently I am working + in college, but I also have a relationship built on love and respect with my mom and dad. My brother does not do anything to help around the house and thinks that he is in charge of my parents. It’s gotten to the point where he can talk down to both of them and they practically cower when he is angry, so I’ve had to step in several times to be confrontational with him even though it puts me in danger. 

He has told me to kill myself several times even though I have suicidal thoughts frequently, him telling me to do it has made me want to even more. He’s called me every slur/curse word in the book (cunt, bitch, dyke, etc.) and has said those things to my mom as well. Last year he told my mom that he can’t wait until she is dead so he doesn’t have to listen to her talk anymore, at 28 years old he was saying these things still. Today my mom told my brother that he shouldn’t have his girlfriend over because of our need for social-distancing (from the spread of COVID-19) since my dad is over 60 and he just sat there and guilted her and made her feel like she was wrong, even though it’s HER house and he doesn’t make any payments to live here! He doesn’t even do chores around the house! 

As someone who has been in abusive relationships, I can see how my brothers behavior is dead on emotional abuse to my mom. The way she feels like she has to explain her reasoning when she asks him to do/not do something makes me feel so depressed I can hardly take it anymore. I feel constantly pent up with anger and resentment towards my family for allowing him to stay here even though he has even physically been aggressive/violent towards me. Although he has mostly given up on bullying me now and turned to my mom as the victim since I am older now. Every time he opens his mouth all I can think about is punching him in the face. I just want him to suffer. I know it sounds awful, but I can’t handle the constant torture he puts my parents through every day. 

I need advice. I really want him out. I would also like to move out, although currently not financially in a place of doing so and I don’t feel comfortable leaving my parents alone with him anymore. I want to try and find some legal action we can take to force him out, it should be pretty easy since he doesn’t even pay rent, but I need to continuously coax my parents. I’ve been begging them to kick him out for the past seven years and every time they get close, they end up going back on it. Even my dad won’t step in anymore to stand up for my mom because he has become useless in his old age. I love my parents and I just want them to be safe. And more importantly, I’m tired of listening to his disgusting mouth every day when I’m just trying to succeed at life, it seriously hinders my mental health just being in the same house as him. If anyone knows the run-around with evicting people who are adults it would be greatly appreciated being added to this thread. Thank you if you took the time to read this, I feel extremely alone in this experience and don’t really have anyone to turn to.",godspien,2020-03-26 07:20:07,2,846,29.21,60.73,44.79,6.23,22.26,13.48,94.56,60.87,21.39,17.38,8.63,0.24,0.24,7.57,0.71,4.02,2.6,16.19,10.17,7.09,6.86,1.89,19.03,4.37,2.25,0.95,1.18,2.48,6.03,2.13,3.9,0.47,1.77,0.59,15.96,3.31,0.12,3.07,6.5,12.17,2.48,2.36,2.13,2.25,1.18,2.84,1.65,0.12,0.59,0.83,2.13,0.59,1.18,0.12,0,7.09,3.19,0.47,2.13,1.06,0.59,3.9,15.01,0.35,15.96,2.25,7.57,6.5,1.77,0.24,1.42,1.42,0,0.47,0.71,0.35,0,0.12,0.24,0,12.88,4.14,3.55,0,0,0,0.24,0.47,0,2.36,1.42,0.71

fpgxax,Protecting myself but how do I protect my furry friends?,"TLDR:  abusive husband what’s to buy rat poison that dissolves a creature’s insides.  I fear for my cat’s safety.

Living in quarantine with an abuser is tough, especially when that abuser is the type that has to do something to stop himself from thinking.

My husband does not like sitting still or relaxing.  He has to do something.  If not, he starts thinking: about bills and the trailer falling apart and how much he hates his job and how I avoid him and how neither of us working means no money to buy food and pay bills.  This causes him to stres.  When he stresses, he does two things: over eats until he vomits then blames me for trying to help him feel better, or yells and screams at me.  Sometimes ... he’ll abuse my cat.

We have a beautiful gray tabby we found shortly after we were married.  He was abandoned at a near by store and I love him.  He is the light of my life, the joy in the sorrow, my escape from pain.  I love him.

He loves my husband.

My husband will scream at him, throw things at him, hit him, spray him with water, lock him in a room with no heat /air conditioning or food or water or litter box for hours and then yell at me when I let him out.  And my cat will ALWAYS go back to him and BEG for attention.  Never me.  I feed him, I play with him, I pet him and brush him.  He never comes to me.  Only my husband.  My husband has made it clear he hates the cat and he WILL get rid of it if anything happens to me.  He will simply open the door and let him out.  This is why my escape plan includes taking the cat.

I’ve lived with this for almost 3 years.  His abusive tendencies started after he was fired from a job he has had since high school and he has been jumping from job to job ever since.  They got worse last year when I lost my 3 part time jobs and went back to school to get a teaching certificate (only to learn half way through the program was a scam).  This is my normal, so I am not too worried.  But now, after a week waiting for test results (we were both exposed to the virus at our jobs), he is saying shit that is scaring me.

He wants to buy rat poison.  He claims there is a rat living in the walls or under the house.  He wants a poison that eats away at the rat’s insides and will make it “drink itself to death.”  When I told him that was horrible, he said “I know you think it is but that is how I have always dealt with vermin’s and you need to get the fuck over it!”

Vermin.  He calls my cat “vermin” when he gets woken up at 3am for food.  Or when my cat scratches him in an attempt to get attention or meows and pleads and begs for him to play with him.  I am horrified that he would want to torture a poor little rat, I am even more horrified that the rat might be a lie and he’s trying to kill my cat.

I don’t know what to do.  I was told we are not to leave the house until we get the test results, so we can’t go and buy the poison.  But we will be allowed out if the results are negative.  Regardless of results, my mother wants me to come home with my cat ASAP, but she and my dad are almost 70.  If I have it, they would be in danger.

I know everyone who comes to this thread is in a horrible situation or was and is trying to give back to the community that helped them, and mine is not the worse.  But I NEED help!  My cat is all I have and my desire to protect life defines me.  How can I stop him?  What can I do?  Yes, it’s “just a rat” but it lives under the house IF it is there.  It hasn’t hurt anyone or chewed up our wires.  It is an innocent creature.  He just wants to kill it to feel powerful and in control.

fpjhx3,Am I sensitive?,"I can’t tell if I actually did something that wrong and being sensitive. My SO asked if I looked into applying for a certain job that my MIL mentioned. I said no as the jobs available would only be temporary, or if not affect another situation. My SO told me it would be more money, to which I replied it would be a downgrade from what I actually do. I said, maybe in a slight tone, “so you and your mother expect me to go from my office job to a kitchen job?” (I have nothing against kitchen jobs, but I have spent years in that field to get to where I am now in a 9-5 office job which is easier to manage time wise with a kid.)

My SO got immediately upset that she didn’t know it was a kitchen job, though I remember her having a brief conversation with her mom about it.. but now I feel like maybe I’m remembering wrong. She got up to leave the room upset and raising her voice over how she can’t take the way I treat her and I can go figure out things the way I need to do it.

It all turned around so fast and I’m left trying to replay in my mind if I was that rude or did something wrong. But what’s said is fading fast. I find I struggle to remember things said or can’t put pieces straight if that makes sense. 

Later I went into the room she went off to and apologized that I was rude and assumed she knew what I was talking about. I feel a bit low right now.. maybe feelings that would come on from past abusive experiences.

fple3i,Parents spoiled us as kids so I feel guilty for saying I was abused.,"Hi. I recently saw my psychiatrist who believes I struggle with either GAD or PTSD. I have a good relationship with my father and an okay relationship with my mother. I see them once a month though it's very triggering for me to visit my childhood home which I feel guilty for at times.

Growing up, my parents seemed to give us the whole world. We always had the newest games and devices (I was eleven when I was given my first laptop). We were in charge of what groceries were bought and didn't necessarily have a bed time. Even if we didn't want anything, my parents would pressure us to get things. My mom would buy us clothes we didn't care for and my dad would bring toys or games home. Their go-to reasoning for why was ""I thought of you!"". There didn't seem to be any malice behind it or bad intentions. But usually this meant that my parents would spend money that they didn't have to make sure we were ""taken care of"". Bills would sometimes go unpaid and my dad would pawn meaningful jewelry and videogames we didn't play to make sure our lights were kept on. This usually ended up in my alcoholic mother drinking and telling us that we weren't grateful for the things they did for us. She'd berate my dad about not budgeting and my dad would then shut down and isolate himself, leaving us to deal with mom during her drunken rampages. She'd be emotionally and verbally abusive, would give us the silent treatment, and throw things. I remember my dad being emotionally absent most of this time as he also dealt with her abuse behind closed and open doors.

The older we got, the worse it seemed to get. I played the scapegoat role in my family so when it came time that I opened up about how bad my anxiety and panic attacks were getting, I was met with intense anger and hostility. I was told ""did we not do enough, haven't we given you everything"". My mom would tell my dad that I was lying about my anxiety to get between them and that they couldn't afford my treatment (even though I was going to a free teen health clinic and my medicine was only a few bucks). My dad became more open with helping me while my mom became more mentally and verbally (only sometimes physically) abusive and closed off from my father and I.

As I got older and started working as a teen, she'd tell me how they couldn't afford their bills and would ask how much I was saving up to move out. This went on for a couple of years, threatening to kick me out only to cry and say how much she would hate it if I left. She'd go between offering to pay for things to wondering why she had to pay for anything at all. Life became unpredictable. I was getting love and affection one day to being abused and neglected the next, to then getting abused for weeks on end. It was like living with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. My dad would tell me ""she wouldn't treat like this if she didn't love you"" which confused me even more.

The thing is that I now don't have a clear picture of what my childhood was like. I have really good memories but also really terrible ones when they do resurface. I had everything that I needed and ever wanted. We weren't rich but we never had to worry about not having food. I had a thoughtful mother and father who still cares about me to this day. My mom is still sometimes absent and will spend time withdrawn from me only to then randomly send me texts of encouragement, love, and validation. So I carry around this guilt that things weren't as bad as what my mind and body has made them out to be, and I'm not sure how to make sense of that.

TLDR; Recently saw psychiatrist who links my anxiety to childhood trauma. Parents spoiled us as kids so I feel guilty for saying that I was abused. Does anyone have a similar experience, and if so, how did you make sense of what seems to be a complicated circumstance?",clankty,2020-03-26 15:43:31,9,740,15.31,59.07,67.05,7.21,18.5,13.51,94.59,59.46,21.89,15.95,9.46,2.97,0.54,1.62,1.35,5.95,2.84,12.84,10.81,5.95,9.59,2.7,22.16,4.19,2.97,2.7,0.54,1.62,7.57,2.97,4.59,1.76,1.76,0.41,15,3.38,0,2.43,1.76,14.59,2.97,2.16,2.97,3.24,1.49,4.05,2.3,0.95,0.54,0.41,2.16,0.27,0.95,0,0.68,8.92,5.14,0.27,1.49,1.49,0.68,8.65,8.38,0.68,11.76,1.89,4.05,5.81,0.81,1.35,0.68,1.89,0,0,0.27,0,0.14,0.14,0,0,12.97,5.54,2.16,0,0.14,0.14,0.14,0.14,1.08,2.84,0.81,0

fpp1gq,"How growing up in a cult broke me (trauma story, trigger warning!)","This is a very, very long read. 



Hello, to someone who might read this. 

It feels weird to do this but I want to tell my story to people who might understand. 
I'm not professionally diagnosed but I definitely have deep emotional and mental problems. Please don't tell me to seek out professional help. I want to have therapy so so bad. I know that I need help, but for now it's not possible, because if I would ask my parents they would tell me I should pray to god and he would fix the ""phase"" I have. 

But I assure you, as soon I get the opportunity to seek out professional help, without my parents knowing I'm going to. 
As long as that is impossible I'm trying to figure out what is going on with me on my own. 

I did so much research during quarantine because I started to question my sense of self, especially my identity and endet up having an internal crisis.

 I thought my issues weren't that deep, because I never was physically abused and technically everything in my life was fine. I had clothes, food and an overall loving family (on the surface). And I played it down because I thought: someone like me can't call their experiences trauma, because I was never hit nor bullied. 

Generally people liked me (because I was a massive people pleaser and still do it but it's gotten better) or at least they were nice to me. My parents supported me, helped me out when I needed money for something. 

And now there are two parts of me fighting. 
The one part that knows exactly how f*cked up I really am and the other part that tells me I'm exaggerating, that I should stop overthinking and stop being ungrateful. 

Im torn and I hope to find at least one person who kind of understands me. 
I feel like no one could ever get me. 
Because my ""trauma"" doesn't feel validated. 
Even though I found out that the part of the brain that is responsible for physical pain is also responsible for emotional pain. 

It still feels like I don't deserve to be heard. 
Because on the surface everything was perfectly fine. 

And even though I talked to friends about it and they really helped me, they still told me to be grateful that I was well liked and no one directly hurt me. But I can't. I can't look at the positive aspects and live normally. 

It affects my life. It affects the person I am. It shaped me. I can't concentrate (and it got worse and worse with time), I have emotional outbursts that I learned to hide, I'm constantly on guard and don't feel safe in my house (because I constantly think my parents could find out something that I'm hiding fro them), I can never relax no matter where I am (except when I'm at my boyfriends house and I know no one is going to be at home for a longer period of time), I feel like I'm not worth it, I feel ugly on the inside and outside, and I hate myself for coping by overeating (I'm not obese nor anything near it, but if I continue to eat how I eat without going to the gym it could happen), I feel like I have to be the main mother-figure to my sisters because my mum so is emotionally detached that I don't want them to think that what she does is real love. 

But the worst thing is how distant I feel from my emotions and myself. Does a ""myself"" even exist? Can I ever be ""it""? I feel numbed out and drained, even though I do nothing all day but distracting myself as good as I can. 

I feel like I never achieved anything and that I never will. 

Everything is overwhelming and so hard to do, even the littlest homework or task. 
That's why I have a pile of work in my e-mails and in the back of my mind that stresses me the hell out. But I just can't get myself to do it unless it has a deadline (and even then I tend to it last minute). 

I feel weak, stupid and misunderstood and I think to myself: if that continues all my good marks are going to drop. And then my parents are going to be a problem even on the surface. 

Im doing my A-Levels (class of 2021) in Germany (I was born here) right now and I just feel like I can't do it. And it is required from me that I get prestigious degree. Even though I would rather pursue a singing career. 

That was the longest introduction I ever wrote, but it needed to be at least written down somewhere. 

So, what is the big deal? What am I complaining about?

 (I'll try to create a chronological order and to remember everything crucial but I yesterday realized that I'm missing blocks of time in my memories even from recent times.) 

It all started even before I was born. 
My parents found each other through friends and got together. 

My mum lived in Kazakhstan before moving to germany (I still don't exactly know why) and my father lived in Siberia before moving to Germany (his and my uncle's parents wanted to prevent them from having to fight in a war zone) and so they happened to live in the same city and then met.
They got together and married. 

Then their neighbors invited them to go with them to a Russian-German evangelical church and they ended up being members. 

Then I was born and everything was perfect. I was in church every Sunday from the moment my mother could leave the hospital. 
I never knew anything different. 

And as soon as I was able to be separated from my mother for 2-3 hours I was with other children in my age while the adults were attending the ""big"" service. 

And then the indoctrination started. 

I don't remember much from my time in church (or the cult as I call it now) from the time before I was 12. I only remember my time in school. Which is very odd to me, but what do I know? 

I just remember being a people pleaser from the start and everything they taught us but there aren't much of clear memories. I was good at being a people pleaser. 
Now it's easy for me to approach people and connect on a surface level. 
But at what price? 

It's scary to me that my memories are so blurry. 
I don't even know who I was friends with, or if I even had friends (before the age of 10).

I just remember that I wanted to be perfect in god's eyes. I wanted to be the perfect example of a girl who loves Jesus with all her heart. 
I wanted people on church to look at me and think that I will make it far in my faith. 
And I achieved that, I think. 

But now I hate my past self for caring so much.
 
So what where we taught there? 
God created the world, Jesus died for my sins and resurrected after three days, the Bible is the only truth and the only way I must live (everything else is the devil's work) and even though they didn't say it in particular but that our church is the only one to teach the ""real"" truth and that every other church doesn't have god in it and immediately leads to hell and damnation. 

We were taught that the secular world was highly dangerous and as soon as were not following one of god's (the church's) rules, were open for demons to attack us. And to make it short: you could sin by thinking something.

 So we were taught to somehow control our thoughts but give full control to god, over every little aspect in our live, because everything is predestined and we don't have control about anything anyways. 

But we're still responsible for our actions somehow and still have a ""free will"" granted from god. 

While writing this I really understand how contradicting this is. 
And it was a core beliefe of mine. 

When an adult who looked after you as a toddler tells you this and there are 500 people who all believe it wholeheartedly, you try to justify it until you really can't anymore. 
And then everything shatters. 

Losing faith in something that was so deeply intertwined with your whole existence is like a part of you just died. Even though you know how ridiculous it was believing in it and you still feel stupid for not realizing it earlier. 

So in a nutshell everything bad you do is because you're not saved (because for someone who is ""really"" saved it's physically impossible to sin no matter how) and automatically fully your fault. But when you achieve something it's because god did it. 

You're never capable of doing or achieving something on your own. You're even unable to think in the ""right, good way"". So you're basically nothing and unimportant. 

But when you come to god, he gives you a purpose he specifically chose for you, you matter to him, you're worthy of his love (and even though we were taught he is forgiving to everyone and (almost) everything) if you only follow him everywhere he leads you. 

Another bizarre contradiction they teach little children: you're nothing but with god you're worthy. 
It makes me unbelievably mad that there are gradually more and more children who grow up believing this. 

Who are taught that demons, the devil and hell are around every corner to take them and torture them for eternity if they slip up one tiny bit. 

That's why I cried myself to sleep for years begging god to forgive me for saying ""sh*t"" one time or thinking in my head that I wanted to kiss a boy, not speaking of being attracted to a girl. 

Because of course anything then straight marriage within my church is wrong (yes I was expected to have a boyfriend within church and if he was in the ""world"" I had to convince him to go to church and he has to love god). 

We weren't allowed to date before 17 and of course no premarital s*x. But they took it further to prevent it all costs. You weren't allowed to be alone in a room with your s.o. Before marriage so nothing could possibly happen. Holding hands and short hugs were allowed when engaged. 

So if you grew up there, find a boyfriend and get engaged as fast as possible (because if you ""fall in love"" it must be gods plan) because you wanna f*ck, and then marry as fast possible (you had to be together at least a year and then be engaged for at least half a year) to have your first kiss ever (if you weren't sinful) I front of everybody when the pastor says: you may kiss the bride. 

We were taught that god wants us to be pure and learn to value our partner's personality. 
They told us girls that if we had a sexual relationship before marriage you would never know if he really loves you or just wants your body. And that every guy outside church would never love us for our personalities.

Another contradiction. These young adults rush into marriage not because they think ""wow I really value my partner as a person"". 
No, they're s*x-driven teenagers lying to themselves (which is absolutely not their fault of course). 

No one is appreciating anything. 
And if they are, they're VERY lucky. 

Because there were maybe 15 people in your age range that you could end up with. 

Girls were also taught to save themselves because we are like chewing gum. 
And if you're all chewed up, your godly future husband wouldn't want you, wouldn't he? 

We were told we were pure glasses of water. 
And if we sleep around before marriage, or even with only one person, every time dirt would fall into our pure water. And no one wants to drink dirty water. 

But the one thing that stuck with me that my mother (and later on more older women) told me was: every time you sleep with a man, he takes a part of your soul with him. That's why there should be only one guy from the start. 

So that you don't end up losing your soul. The thought of that terrified me to the core and I believed it. 
Now I know it's bullsh*t but it was in my head constantly for 5-6 years. 

We were told to cover up so guys don't sin with their eyes and thoughts. Knee-length skirts and shorts were allowed (and I always hated how they looked on me) and you had to cover your belly and your shoulders at all cost. Cleavage was obviously not allowed and so weren't tight clothes (only skinny jeans, not leggings). Especially when you had a little bit more chest. 

And if you dared to show a little tiny bit of skin (no matter how hot summer was) even if it was accidental, you'd get in trouble for it.

I was in that godforsaken building almost everyday. Except for Wednesdays where we would meet up with our local little group of girls (there was a leader a few years older then us and I'm glad mine wasn't as controlling as others and didn't force me too much to work in different groups in church) and discuss what our beloved (I could vomit remembering him and his sleazy and narcissistic behavior) pastor taught us last Sunday. 

I was involved in worship (and my love for singing kind of saved me because that's the only thing I really did because I myself wanted it) I danced (which was ok it was workout for me and not dancing for god when I think about it) I looked after toddlers once month during service (with other women) I was in the theater group and when there was an event for teenagers I was responsible for leading a group of other teenagers to organize it so everything was done and standing where it belongs (I liked organizing, so I was lucky they just positioned me there but it still was hella stressful). And I played the piano(which I didn't really enjoy). 

So there are the Basics. I was heavily involved. 

With 12 you move from being with children to the ""big"" service and you're finally old enough to be part of all the cool things the teenagers did. 

But then you're also constantly stressed out which worsened every year because obviously school got harder, but also church demanded more and more and suddenly you were thrown into highly responsible tasks which drained you. 

When I was 14 I started to constantly have headaches. I started drinking coffee because I was exhausted of not being able to sleep, being stressed out and constantly worried that someone would find out my secrets. (And now I need a very strong one for it to ""work"".)

Because in school I was someone else. I had a different name in school (my real name). In church the pastor required my parents to introduce me with a very far away nickname from my real name because it sounded like a name in the Bible that an evil person had and if I'd be called that it would curse me. 

I did and said what I wanted (it increased gradually because I still tried to be ""myself"", which you could be in church (no),  in school but obviously couldn't do that, because no one can ). 

I thought I was being myself I school and maybe that was ""myself"" when I was 14 but I still was the most severe case of a people pleaser. 

And I always endet up in dependent toxic friendships because I could never say anything against them. I had no one else who was close to me. So that also hurt me even though I didn't notice at the time. 

People abused my kindness, because in church they told us we had to be nice. And I could do at least that. So I held on to being nice to everyone, helping everyone and inviting people to come to church who were remotely close to me. Which still embarrasses me the most, but you get in trouble when you're not inviting people. 

I'm so glad I was in a very accepting class. No one was ever really bullied, just mocked for a few things, maybe. 
Which I was for being in that ""church"". 
And they told me early on: it's a cult, you believe in crazy sh*t, stop going there. 
But we were taught that people who are afraid of the truth always say that. 

School was kind of a safe place for me, even if I had toxic friendships and got hurt a few times, because we live about 25 kilometers away from church (the cult lol) and no one I knew from there could see me. 
And even though we were taught that god could see EVERYTHING and is always reading our thoughts I didn't feel very watched (I was scared sh*tless when I wore something in school we weren't allowed to wear in church and I thought I saw someone I knew) so I felt better in school then at home. 

And that's why my definition of ""home"" is something entirely different then that of people who grew up in an emotionally safe home. 

So what was living in my ""home"" like? 

I'm the first daughter of three and therefore my fathers precious first born. I learned really fast that just keeping quiet, smiling and doing what I'm told is the best way to avoid any more stressful situations. I hated every form of confrontation and I still do.

When I was as young as 3 my father threatened to hit me with a belt (and did it a few times) but I stopped misbehaving or questioning so no one yelled at me anymore and no one told me to stand in a corner without looking around. 

So I just learned to not show my emotions at all at ""home"". Because emotions cause trouble and distress. They also told us that. God and our own intellect (which is controlled by god) must lead us. Emotions come out because of the devil. 

My father was in control of everything and to this day he's still extremely, s*xist, r*cist, homophobic, transphobic etc. You name it. 
And he still thinks I have exactly the same opinions as him. 

He is very critical of my boyfriend, but because he puts on a facade in front of my father as I do my father likes him. 

My parents (more my father) still don't want me to have anything premarital, even though they are less strict then before. So yeah I can't ask for birth control because then they would not let me see my bf. 

As I said my father is very controlling and has a very high opinion of himself. Because he is providing for our family he doesn't have to do anything regarding the house. This is on the woman and the four girls in his house, because that's what god made us for. 

Popping out babies, cleaning und cooking. 

But I still have to have a degree and a high paying job. 

And then I ask myself: what do you want from me? What? 

In church we learned that you have to find a job that gives you enough time to be as active as possible in church while giving birth to as many children as possible and managing your whole household completely alone. 

Because your husband is by god's law above you and there to ""lead"" you. How remarkably generous of you to lead me, because I can't decide on anything ever due to always thinking I don't have control anyways. 

That's why I need to plan everything obsessively and always know and control what's going on.

I idolized my father until the realization that we don't have any emotional bond slowly reached me until it hit me hard. 

I had to organize my phone a certain way and delete massages so in case he would want to go through it he wouldn't find anything. 

He wanted me to be his perfect show-daughter who has good marks and serves god with all of her existence. And he really did that. 
In front of him I am what he wants me to be. 

I don't know what my mother wants. She just does what my father tells her and silently agrees to what he has to say. Maybe I learned to behave in that way because she did. I'm honestly sorry for her because she never had a chance to study anything that could make her independent, because of moving to Germany with 17 or 18 and not being able to speak the language very well. 

I could cry, because, no matter how brutal this sounds, her life is over in a way. She is what I never want to be. 

Whenever they told us how our future will look like I had a kind of panic that I never felt before. At the time I suppressed that but when I think back my heart rate goes up and I feel like I need to run as fast as I can. 

And that's why I hate to be dependent on someone. But weirdly I still end up in situations where I'm highly dependent. 

Another thing that I can maybe explain now is my reaction to my grandfathers death (he was more of a father to me then my own and his and his wife's home (which I also deeply loved) felt safe). 

When I was 11 years old my grandmother (my grandfathers wife) passed away because of cancer. And I was never allowed to see her while she was sick nor to attend the funeral. 

And in that time I already saw my grandpa rarely. When my parents told me my grandma passed away I cried one time.

I know that I was sad but I somehow can't really recall my immediate emotions from that day. 

And I thought I'm glad that I still have my grandpa. But he passed away three months later. And I wasn't able to see him during these months. When my father (emotionlessly) told us that his father also passed away I felt nothing. I didn't cry. No reaction at all. And then I didn't think about it for years. 

But when I was 14 all of the sudden all of the emotions I should have felt when I was 11 crushed me harder then anything ever. 

It was like reliving the day I was told he was gone for ever for almost a year. And I was so confused. Why now? Why didn't I feel anything back then? Because my brain was already way to stressed for an 11 year old and just didn't process properly. 

Then three years later something triggered my memories and the horrors began. 

When I was 16 it hit me again because I found out he committed s*icide (through my cousin). 

Back to the cult. 
So am I still there? No. 

My parents realized how manipulative literally everything about it was and without telling anyone there (childhood friends I grew up with included) we went there one last time and on Sunday the 23rd September 2018 we drove away and never came back. 

And many others left too. 
We still meet every Sunday and I still sing there, because I don't want to confront my parents.
 
I really don't want to be there because every time we're there I'm not really there. I'm just a shell that moves around. During the preaching (which a few men do in turns) I'm always completely zoned out and can only concentrate for a bit if I really really try. 

I don't know what that is or that means but I absolutely hate it because I can't control it. 

And sometimes I'm just sad for no reason, I still can't sleep and still get a massive headache and can't stand up properly without strong coffee. I still eat too much stuff really shouldn't and I feel bad for every little bit I eat. But I can't stop. 

And it also affects all of my relationships, especially with my bf. He sometimes doesn't understand but he still comforts me and is patient which I am really grateful for. 

And something that comes to my mind only now is that my father used to completely lose it when I had a bad mark. I was afraid to come home and always started crying before even telling him. And then he would shout even more, beat the table with his fist and tell me to stop crying. 

Now I can control if I'm going to cry or not when something upsets me. And if I want to show my emotions or not. Being a very good liar was essential and it still is.

When my father is mad at me because I didn't do the dishes he still gets very impulsive and shames me because if he works and gives me food and clothing it's disrespectful to leave the dishes for too long. And when he stands beside me and doesn't stop while I do the dishes I just nod my head and say yes. It's the only way to avoid more pain at all costs. 

There are these moments but also the ones where he tries to talk to me and asks me how I am and then he tells me how he loves his first born princess. He tells that I'm the best daughter someone could have and that he's so so proud of me. And I just smile at him and say thank you. 

But on the inside I think: ""if you knew who I really am and what I did that you don't of, you wouldn't talk to me anymore"". 

He is proud of the daughter he created for himself that I still am in front of him. 

And also my mother tries to get closer to me after 16 years of distance and letting the church raise us. And the only thing that I would tell her if I was honest for a few seconds in the midst of all the lies I protect myself with is: ""I'm sorry but it's too late."" 

I don't have any emotional connection to my parents and I never had. 

The first 16 years of my life partly wasted. 
I feel like someone took my childhood from me. Even my memories are blurry. 
And I know it's technically not my parents fault but I want to blame them so badly. 

And it makes me so mad that I was born because of the ""church"". Because they convinced my father to have children. 
I was cursed before I even existed. 

And still. 

I can recall a few beautiful memories of things I did with my friends there. The sleepovers, summer camp, singing together, playing hide and seek in the big building. 

All of us connected through our fear of the dangerous outside world and hell. 

There is no moment in my life where I wasn't afraid that some adult could dream, or feel( they taught us that god can reveal things about people to you when you have strong connection to the holy spirit) that I  was a dirty sinner that acted differently in school.

And it was so frightening, because when it's out that you messed up you can't attend certain rituals( like the holy communion) and that's when people know. They see that you're not taking part in it and the first thing that comes to mind is of course ""premarital s*x!!!"" 

When a couple did it (and someone found out) it's made sure by the authorities that in a week everyone knows. 

And I wanted to avoid people thinking that at all costs so was very aware and on guard all the time.

 I made sure I had a different app also open while watching vampire diaries on my phone because there you can switch faster so my father or my mother (who still just burst into my room whenever they want to) would never know I would watch something the devil created.

 My parents and everyone in church who was ""responsible"" for me always tried to shelter me and get anything with a ""bad influence"" away from me. 

But I still watched what I wasn't allowed to. The internet and myself raised me when my beliefs started to break away. People like Jenna Marbles taught me things parents should teach their kids. I educated myself on so much stuff I missed out on and started to build my own opinions and morals from 14-16. 

Basic knowledge like: it's okay to not believe what your parents believe was so new to me.
 
And now? I just want to move out and study something so I'm always safe. I can't wait for the day where I'm finally going to be financially independent and don't have to rely on my father.

Wow it feels good put all of that in words. 

When you read until now you must be really really bored, but thank you. I appreciate your attention greatly.

fq094t,Where to turn to for sheltering/asylum foreigners under domestic violence?," In advance, I please request that no discrimination or prejudice is to be said or intended. I will be very strict on that. An individual is not responsible for any of his/her governmental/political/elite' actions.

Without further ado.

A very good friend and fellow artist from DeviantArt, Arslan, has contacted me in a last resort. He is under physical, verbal and emotional abuse from his family, and because of his locality's religious upbringings, where the ""father of the house makes the rules and is in his rights to apply them in any means"", the local government and social services refuse to help my friend.  
Arslan is from Pakistan, which worsen things, as he can find no shelter outside of his home. Because of the same religious-based regulations, an unmarried individual cannot rent lodgings, even for work. And he cannot marry, because they are still with the arranged marriage system, and couples are not allowed to see each other before the actual marriage.  
Again, police and social services are out of the question because of the region he's living in. They are still very much religion-based (he's an atheist as a result), and they refuse his plea for help, because to them, that is a normal father behaviour as dictated by their religion. If the ""father of the house"" tells rules and do things because he wish them, then his household must obey, and stand the consequences if they don't. It's not just from him that I've learned that, it's a very common idealogy in Middle-Eastern, including one of my friend had to fight against when she went underground to catch abusers and help abused Middle-Eastern women find shelter.

Does anyone of you know of anywhere or of any ways, organizations, shelters, etc, that can shelter and allow asylum to foreigners in such a need? I really don't know anything about it, but I can't just sit back and let him go through that hell. We don't allow that from abused women in his situation, so I'm certainly not making it an exception.

fq0xqf,Why do I keep letting myself get sucked in,"I was abused by my mother until I was 17. She was a malignant narcissist, and emotionally and physically abused me until I ran away from home. 

I keep finding myself searching for someone who can take her place, and winding up in bad situations. 
I threw away my entire life for a friend I'd only known online to move in with him. I thought I knew him, but the longer I lived with him, the more afraid I was of him and the more I expected him to hurt me. He would joke that my mother abused me because I was a shitty kid (we have a ten year age gap so there was a lot of sudo-parent stuff going on). He would repeat the same behaviors my mother did and then yell at me for reverting to what I did when I lived with her. He would tell me to clean and then complain about how I cleaned, so I stopped cleaning. He would belittle me for how I dressed, what I liked, how I spoke. He told me I wasn't good at things I wanted to do. He chose a career for me and told me to give up on the things I wanted. He had me convinced that he could tell what I was thinking and that he knew what was best for me. And then, he got tired of me. 
I spent so long being abused by my mother that my reaction to certain types of control isn't to people please, its to shut down. And so I wasn't giving him the attention he needed. I should have seen it sooner- he was supplementing his time with a kid (I'll call him M) a few years younger than me whos much more of a people pleaser. 

Anyway, the big issue here is I'd moved overseas to be with him. And I had to go home because my visa was running out. And I hadn't had a job. I start looking for a place in the states, and I get a job. Through a series of snafus, I wind up coming to the conclusion that I'm going to be homeless when I get back to the states. 
Fine, I've been there before. But when it comes time to leave he acts like everything is great, tells me to call him when I get there. Then I don't hear from him for several days. Finally he sends M into my messages with a laundry list of complaints about me. Apparently they'd hated me the entire time, and I was too much of a pain in the ass for them to tell me because when they suggested I go be homeless I said I wanted to kill myself. 

The shitty thing is, I still care about him. He did a lot of good for me. If he called right now I'd probably answer. There's a good chance he'll find this post and he and M will have a good laugh. 

Ik what he did to me doesn't really count as abuse, just toxicity, but it makes me wonder. Why do I keep getting sucked in? I saw the warning signs for months. My friends told me to get out, to run, and I didn't listen. I feel like I'm just so desperate for an authority figure that I'll take whatever abusive behaviors come with them.",why-doyoucare,2020-03-27 10:11:28,6,577,25.53,30.15,67.62,12.1,16.03,10.05,94.97,64.12,25.48,21.14,14.56,0.17,0,5.72,0.69,4.33,5.72,14.38,9.88,6.07,7.63,1.21,22.36,3.29,2.25,3.12,0.35,2.08,6.24,2.6,3.64,0.35,2.25,0.17,13,0.87,0.35,1.21,5.37,9.71,2.43,1.91,2.08,1.39,0.69,1.73,2.25,0.69,1.04,0.52,1.73,0.52,1.21,0,0,6.07,0.87,0.35,2.25,2.6,0.52,8.67,9.36,2.25,12.82,2.95,4.85,5.03,0.52,0.35,0.52,0.35,0,0.17,1.04,0.87,0,0,0,0.17,13.69,5.89,3.47,0,0,0.17,0,0.35,0,3.12,0.69,0

fq1yiu,How can I leave my abusive family permanently? 18/f/UK,"TW; emotional/physical/sexual abuse, suicide 

Hi all, I’m an 18 year old female from London. On a gap year, hope to study at LSE whenever uni reopens.

Growing up in a South Asian, Muslim family has always been difficult. I’m moving out for first year because I need to leave my house ASAP. I’m really scared on where I can go during holiday time at uni eg summer holidays because I can’t afford to live in London myself without student finance. 
My situation at home is disgustingly bad. My ear is bleeding right now cause of a physical fight I’ve just had with my family, I’m literally going to be killed here. 

To list a few events that have happened (so you guys can have an insight/understand how unsafe it is for me to stay at home for any longer);

My mum and sister blindfolded me, tied a scarf around my mouth, tied me up around my body, threw me on my bed, closed the curtain, took my light bulb out and m locked my room for three days. I don’t know how I survived. I went to school on Monday looking so bad, my teacher pulled me aside and asked if everything was okay. I started crying cause it finally felt like someone acknowledged that I’m being abused and just said I didn’t get to have enough hours to sleep. 

My dad beats me up, pulls my hair and drags me down the stairs, forces me into a tiny space and leaves me there locked up for hours. 
My dad gets so angry, he’s threatened to ‘murder my pussy’ and threatens to rape me.
My mum has tried to throw me out of the window from two stories. 
My sister putting a knife on my throat, grabbing my breasts, punching and kicking my vagina  and other stuff to physically abuse and molest me. Literally crying writing this, I’ve never been able to open up about what I experience at home. 

That’s a minuscule of the physical stuff I’ve experienced, the verbal abuse hurts in so many ways too. Honestly, from being called a whore, a slag, a devils child, a sin, useless for things like getting my ears pierced (even though I told them I will) or coming home 10 minutes later (due to stuff like bus was late) than I was told to. 
I’ve tried to commit suicide since I was 9 years old. From trying to hang myself, drinking bleach countless times, staying out late alone when I’m so vulnerable (I’m a young, petite female) in hopes that someone would kill me. (Cause it’s come to the point that being kidnapped/raped and then murdered would bring me peace than being at home) (not a rape fetish at all, genuinely and sadly feel this way) 

I don’t know how I’ve been able to survive at this point, Ramadhan is coming up and I’m so scared for my life. Especially if we’re gonna be quarantined during this period. I will die somehow, I need to leave soon for uni and I need to plan ahead. 

- what can I do to survive during the holidays where students are expected to go home eg summer holidays? Given that my uni rent is around £9K alone, I was thinking to get into prostitution for survival, I see/ have had men contact me online offering free rent/shared room with them in exchange for sex a few times a week. It breaks my heart because no one should have to that and it’s unsafe. 

- My uni degree will last three years if I don’t decide to do a year abroad. I was only thinking of moving out for first year since I’ll be in uni accommodation 
- I don’t know what to do for second &amp; first year because rent for second and third year will be SO expensive cause London is disgustingly expensive. 
- Any advice/ anyone I can contact etc for assistance, I would really appreciate. 

I just need to plan ahead because I never want to come back. I’m emotionally and physically worn out. The trauma haunts me everyday, I’m living in a nightmare. If anyone knows people/organisations that can support me please let me know. I’ve come to the point where I know I need to speak to a therapist and be honest about all of this baggage because there’s a lot and it’s so destructive that it’s ruining the relationship I have with myself and prevents me from making intimate relations with people.

fq5xdx,Am I being mentally abused by my partner?,"So, I apologize if this seems like a long post but I feel I have to explain a little background about my relationship with my partner and the circumstances behind whats happening. (Cross posted to relationship advice subreddit) 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for what is approaching 4 years together. The first year of our relationship was great- no arguments, mutual support, and physical and emotional kindness. But then after 1 year we started to have little arguments over stupid things and I figured it just came with the territory. Usually these arguments were pertaining to me pointing out some type of work on the house (he is renovating) that could be improved or isn't done right when he shows me the work. I don't point them out in a mean way, I would try to make them into questions or phrases that would not upset him. However, despite this, any time I said anything constructive he flew off the handle and started yelling or telling me that I never do anything and all he does is things to make me happy. 

This past year his father became very ill and is in jeopardy of dying from complications of his illness. Needless to say my boyfriend has been spending a lot of time with his dad to try to make up for lost time between them since he hasn't always been super close to his father. 

This is where it begins. Our personal arguments between each other have become very intense and I can't help feeling like they are my fault. I attend college so I usually don't see him except for the weekends when I stay over with him. However, because he is spending time with his dad, I haven't seen much of him lately. I have seen him 1 day in the past 2 weeks because he is with his parents every day. I am trying my best to be patient and accept that I can't see him as much but not having even a full day with him has really taken its toll on my happiness. 

Lately I have tried to express this to him that I am feeling very sad and depressed sitting alone all the time and not being able to spend any time with him to work on stuff around his house or even eat dinner with him. In the present situation he will tell me to come over one day and then in the morning tell me he actually has something else to do (even though he said he was free the night before) but tell me to come over anyway. When I say I would prefer not to come over and just be alone at his house he tells me I am not acting like an adult. He also says it is just my choice not to come over and its my fault we aren't spending time together. He cannot put aside even 1-2 hours to spend with me and even if he does it is usually spend fighting with him shouting or him on his phone or watching a movie by himself. It feels very isolating to me. We used to be very physically and emotionally connected and involved and it feels like it has all changed these past few months so suddenly. Another reason is I do not feel completely safe there in the house alone and he doesn't like when I lock the doors to the house and will get angry if I lock them when I am alone there and he comes back. 

When I express my sadness due to lack of time spent together over the past few months (and the fact that he cannot set aside even an hour or two for us to spend together happily) he will usually get VERY angry and start screaming things I should have done to make him not start yelling, or tell me to snap out of it, or tell me I have nothing to be upset about, or make me question if I am doing wrong towards him and the arguments are really my fault. This makes me feel like I am a bad person and I feel now as if I am slipping into a bigger bout of depression than I was already in and experiencing anxiety that keeps me from going to sleep most nights until 5 or 6am. This causes me to then sleep all day due to lack of sleep at a normal time (I also have a medical condition that zaps my energy and he is well aware of it). Usually this then becomes another topic of argument- that because I am sleeping late into the day I am not useful around the house and I don't do anything. As you can imagine, this makes me feel even worse and the cycle continues. I usually try to talk to him and tell him to ""please stop yelling"" at me. He usually continues until I am left crying into my hands and then proceeds to shout that my crying is making him guilty or say something along the lines of, ""great now your crying again"". When I start crying from his yelling he does not physically comfort me at any point or ever tells me he is sorry. That is one thing that really stuck with me- the not comforting me while I am crying because anytime he cries I try to comfort him. If I express any sort of emotional anguish or sadness he gets mad and I find myself having to repress my feelings about just about everything in our relationship. I feel like I have to be a machine with no emotion so he won't feel bad. Another thing that really stood out to me was a ""joke"" that he would say to me (insisting it was a funny joke), ""I am going to hit you"". To me it wasn't a joke and I asked him multiple times to stop saying it before it finally stopped (I think). Other things include him saying I have no humor and I don't laugh when he tells jokes, but I find I am usually too upset to laugh or hurt from something he said earlier. Despite these things, I forgive him without every getting an, ""I am sorry,"" and push my feelings to the side until it happens again- it is a pattern of behavior I think. 

I feel that there is some sort of gaslighting going on because he makes me feel like I am crazy or selfish for feeling sad that we aren't spending any time together or that I am unhappy with parts of our relationship that I am trying to (properly) work on with him. He also insists that I am trying to come between him and his family by wanting to spend an amount of time with him because after all, we are in a relationship. I am trying to give him all the space and time that he needs with his parents and family but I don't know if I am being unreasonable or cruel for thinking we should also be able to spend at least one day a week together. 

This could also just be an overreaction or me reading too far into things but it almost seems like he is absorbing all of the things I once loved or appreciated into things that he does. It feels like my identity is being eroded away from me and there isn't anything that is mine anymore. 

I was reading articles about mental abuse earlier because it finally dawned on me that what might be going on is a form of mental abuse (maybe some on my end to?). I came to this conclusion after he texted my in the morning after I said I was feeling sad (because he said I could come over but it turns out he will be gone again) things like, ""fuck you,"" ""you are being selfish,"" ""you are not acting like an adult,"" ""its not all about you,"" ""get over it you have nothing to be sad about"". I was going down a list of things that partners who mentally abuse you do and I found myself remembering multiple instances of at least half of the types of behaviors listed coming from my partner. I was also reading about symptoms of mental abuse in the people being abused and also find that I identify with almost all of the symptoms- anxiety, depression, insomnia, eating issues, loneliness, gaps in memory, and even the PTSD symptoms.  But I also think maybe I am trying to make more out of it than can potentially be there because I know people do things they usually don't want to or say things they don't mean while under stress- which I know he is. 

I understand that this is a really hard time for him and his family and I am trying my best to not let it affect our relationship. Could his behavior just be because he is under stress with his family or afraid to lose his dad? Or am I being selfish by wanting a little bit of time set aside for us to at least see one another? 

I want to work on our relationship and I love him very much but I do not know what to make of any of this or how to help the situation. I am sorry if this post seems sort of long and rambling- I am trying to piece my thoughts together.",funnyfunny1197,2020-03-27 14:14:23,0,1605,22.91,38.47,78.19,2.55,29.72,13.89,95.89,63.93,22.43,15.95,8.91,0.87,0.56,5.17,0.44,6.48,3.68,14.52,9.84,6.17,8.47,2.62,20.75,4.3,2.06,0.93,0.93,2.55,6.98,2.12,4.74,0.62,1.43,1.74,12.59,0.69,0.37,0,5.61,15.83,3.55,1.74,1.62,5.3,1.18,5.36,3.24,0.44,1.43,1.31,1.5,0.31,0.62,0.06,0.37,6.92,2.93,1.68,1.18,0.69,0.87,3.24,14.14,1.18,14.64,1.74,5.61,7.29,0.37,0.81,0.75,0.75,0,0.06,0.19,0.06,0,0,0.06,0.06,9.47,3.18,1.87,0,0,0.25,0,0.5,1.25,1.18,1.25,0
fq7ngl,Trying to get over it,I read some stories on here and decided to post mine. A few weeks ago my cat knocked over my garbage in the house. I had asked my bf to take out the trash. It’s the one thing I ask Bc he doesn’t work and I do and he plays video games all day. He didn’t so there was trash everywhere and I was frustrated so I yelled at him and called him lazy. Then he called me a bitch so I laughed and called him an asshole. I don’t think he liked it Bc I was laying on the couch and he got up and started choking me. Really hard. The pain was intense and he dug his nails into the side of my neck and it left a bruise/gash. He said I was weak and stupid. He then said how he was never like this with any other girl and It was me who made him like that. He also said I was lucky because it “could have been worse”. I love him and I just don’t want this to happen again. We’ve been together almost 6 months now. Everything has been perfect.

fqdjtt,My dad and brother are very annoying,"I usually avoid my dad. My brother moved back bc of the covid 19 stuff. They are so annoying its like they go out of there way to create conflict over the most ridiculous things and they always think they're in the right. My dad is a douche bag. He said he hated something or someone on tv and my brother said hate is a strong word, because of that my dad said all words are strong what does that even mean and wanted to argue about that in a heated way. Obviously he knew what my brother meant. My brother proceeds to be extremely loud at night when others are sleeping talking at a normal volume and turning the tv up loud and just overall not caring that it's night time and others are sleeping. He kept farting so much that it stank up the entire house to high heaven and I could smell it in my room I thought someone burnt something in the kitchen and it was him and I was like wow that really stinks I can smell it from my room. He wanted to then argue that i could not actually smell it from my room. so i told him to go smell for himself then for all I care. and he was like oh I guess it doesn't smell then from your room. Logic fail. obviously if you don't believe me then why would i go ""re smell"" your shit stained air again if you already didn't believe it to be true. also who fucking cares I wasnt sure what tf that stench was at first I am allowed to be a human being and wonder you dont need to dictate interactions. ALSO this inconsistent nature of my brother and father being upset or uncaring or telling me whatever I don't care if I have a problem and want support be it with being bullied or having conflict with a friend. BUT if they need help they want me to be their 100% for them and listen to their venting or stories. It is the most ridiculous thing. Why the fuck are they wanting me to be there for them when they aren't there for me? The can both fuck off. I blocked them both on social media I cant deal with their arguments over the most little things. Like seriously if you want to yell at me for making up a rule in your head then fuck off. another example my dad makes tons of comments on my body and tries to tell me how I feel about men. like if i like listening to a male singer my dad says stuff like oh its bc you want to sleep with them and they would love being with you and then he gives me creepy looks. I honestly hate them. idk if this even makes sense they're super annoying and I wish they would leave me alone.

fqdwiv,How do I move on?,"To start I'll give you a quick back story on my life. I was born in the Carribean ( I am an immigrant) I know live in the U.S. 

I moved to the U.S when I was very young with my mom and stepdad. They fell in love, mom decided to go to the U.S with him to be his wife.

Fast forward about 2 years*

A lot of abuse goes down. A lot. They physically fight, hit each other, cuss on another out constantly. I was probably 8-10 years old. 
Now child me is watching this. We don't have much, we are broke, and we struggle.

However, I was a very intelligent kid so I was alway in the ""rich kid class"" the ""popular kids class"" as I like to call it. 
I started comparing myself to every. SINGLE. ONE
OF. THOSE.KIDS.


Wondering why I had the life I did. At a young age I started to also pay attention to MY MOTHER'S ABUSE.
She would beat me. Tie me up to a fridge, and beat me. She broke an iron spatula over my skin once. Left marks for hours. 

She would make me feel disgusting. 
I was an obese kid. I remember a remark she mad about my stretch marks. 
I would go to food for comfort for all the pain she would put me through. 
But she told me, while looking at 11 year old me with disgust. ""If you don't lose weight your whole body is just going to look like that"". 

She would then scream at me
Make me feel at fault for almost everything.
She would always tell me not to embarrass her. Always.  When I wanted to dress a certain way, or wear my hair a certain way. ( I grew up in a white dominated area, I was the only black child in elementary with around 250+ white kids) so this was a big deal.

I remember when she she would send me to school with welts on my skin and tell me she would ""finish with me"" when I got home. A lot of anxiety kicked in there. 

BUT HERE IS THE KICKER
SHE IS A THERAPIST NOW. 
She went to school for 6 years to get her masters in psychology. 
She is flourishing now. She acts like she wants to build a relationship. But I just can't. 
All of this is the tip of the iceberg. 
Am I mean if I don't want much to do with her? 
She has never apologized. I don't think she ever will at the moment.

fqff2p,I dont know what to do,"so um hi im vaporeon14 i guess you can just call me vap im the only girl ina family of 6 brothers ill try to remember everything accurately as the best as i can.  My mom met DB(deadbeat)(moms ex/husband) somewhere around early 2016, she had told me she first saw him in the bar.  it would start out small just some fighting here and then but it would keep going on and on even through the night, he also had a habit of stealing our stuff to keep his arm candy going.  but then when the withdraws started happening he would start talking to himself as if someone was there to which he would start saying awful things about my brothers and I to which my mom would actually believe but she would take us out to our favorite park and tell us to stop making up lie's about DB.  later on he would start abusing my mom but she was madly in love with him and she was determined to marry him, as the abuse continued he started to be sloppy with his arm candy he would leave open containers of bud light in my lil brothers room, i had yelled at that he could have drank some of it but my mom had no worries about it she was a great mom she was the only parent we could look up to but he started to taint her.  One day DB had brought home a dog he knew HE knew that the dog was used to kill cats, on a cloudy day he let that dog out to which the dog had gotten a firm and tight grasp on our beloved family pet KC this was my third oldest brothers cat he loved her so much the dog had gotten her in my lil brothers room he witnessed our family member die in front of him.    
 my mom let that slide my lil brother blames himself to this day but what was worse she told him to dig her a grave but he threw her into the field, i had come across her lifeless body i was so mad at what he'd done but he wasnt punished for it so with shovel in hand i was crying while digging a proper grave.  a couple months had passed it was somewhere around midnight, i had lost my rooms key and my mom had another key to my room on her key ring that was always in her purse and i would always have my room locked no matter what. one night that one fucking night i woke up to my door wide open with the hall light on and my bra off (it was the one that hooked from the front) and my shirt was up and blank off me i was so pissed at what he had done(i ended up throwing that bra away). i wanted to tell my mom what he had done to me cuz it would have been no one else that could have done it.  he had a habit of staying up all night but i wanted her to be happy i wanted her to actually be happy to which i stayed quiet. (this one was before that night) one day he told my mom i was trying to seduce him i was wearing a tank top and shorts that went to the knees since it was 100 degrees out in the middle of summer i still got in trouble.  he would later on rake up tons of debt for us to get rid of, stole my brothers 3DS and pokemon games he has cf before the medicine that came out to help people like him now has it, stole my class ring(we later got it back from the pawnshop), cheating on my mom more then once even while she was dyeing in the hospital, left used syringes in lil brothers room, as well as try making his own arm candy, as well as actually abusing my lil brother, theirs more but i cant list em all. When i had finally told my mom what he had done to me she told me 'Oh well he was just looking for money thats all' when i heard that i was crushed and upset i didnt want to have these feelings, i didnt want to keep hurting.  She has divorced him but continues bringing him around im thinking about threatening her to call cps cause lil brother doesnt want him around anymore.

  im going to wait till april to make a decision since im too afraid of the answer she'll say and i was hoping what others would say.

fqhrxd,Any advice?,"Okay so brief rundown:

Had an abusive ex partner, she roped me into moving in with and marrying her by ""love bombing"" me. She introduced me too and got me hooked on a couple different substances and since leaving I've struggled a lot with alcohol (which I have been putting in a lot of work to kick, over 2 months sober!). When married to her there was frequent tantrums, she would throw food, yell and scream. She was extremely verbally abusive and emotionally manipulative and really did a number on me, forced me to move from NewZealand to Australia to get way from her.

Anyway, since then she hasn't left me alone. It's been about a year and ever since I left I've had at least monthly messages from new social media accounts she'll make, received things in the mail, had fake dating app accounts made under my name getting hundreds of gay men to send me unsolicited dick pics through social media and text. 

I've made a report with the police against her and that went largely nowhere but this is really taking it's toll on me, all of which is documented in my psychologists and psychiatrists notes. 

Any thoughts on how I should handle the situation?

They could have prevented it but they were too naive for letting that man live in our house for that period of time. It's their fault. They should've been more gentle with me back in the day for me to confess, but the way they asked was angry and I knew that if I confess I would be a shame. A disgusting child. I became a great liar just to hide that disgraceful truth. I thought that if I don't tell them I'll eventually forget it. But years has passed and I still think about it. I tried to bury it to the back of my head but some things trigger that memory. Sometimes I get angry at people who complains about heart breaks and here I am silently crying for something that haunted me for years and still is. I get angry with normal people who have normal lives, but I realized I wasn't angry, I was jealous. Jealous of a normal life with no history of something traumatic. But I was also angry with men, that piece of shit is a man, my father who was supposed to protect me was a man but wasn't able to do anything and let me live in this situation. I know that I wasn't supposed to generalize them but I couldn't help it, no matter what people say I would always hate them. Until now I don't trust a single man in my life, I push men who'd claim that they like me away. Truth is I was more fine telling strangers about this knowing they don't know me rather than the people I'm acquainted with, because I don't trust them. I plan to speak to a professional sometime, I don't know exactly what I want from them, maybe because I just want someone to talk to about this. I don't want to tell my parents because what could they do? I've already been abused without them knowing. For 10 years I haven't spoke to anyone about this, just this platform and those years I lived a life of being different to what I could've become is I wasn't abuse, I pretended to laugh all the time, became my friends support system, a caring daughter who excels in academic, a strict sister to my siblings and had a very high walls that no one ever broke. But I was really curious, what would be my attitude if I wasn't abused? I guess I'll never know.",Iballismist,2020-03-28 04:36:32,1,549,6.09,16.72,90.25,1.13,21.12,12.93,95.99,64.12,27.69,17.49,13.66,0.18,0,0.73,2.91,10.2,3.64,10.56,12.93,6.19,6.38,3.64,22.4,4.55,0.91,3.1,1.28,1.09,8.01,2.37,5.65,0.36,3.83,0.36,12.75,1.28,0.18,0.36,2.37,16.03,4.01,1.09,3.28,3.1,1.28,5.1,1.64,0.18,1.28,0.18,2.37,0.73,1.28,0.36,0,5.28,1.46,0.73,1.46,0.55,1.28,9.11,11.11,0.91,10.02,0.73,3.1,6.56,0.55,0.18,0.36,0,0.55,0.18,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,0,14.03,4.19,4.74,0,0,0.55,0,0,0,4.55,0,0
fqjoah,I don’t know if belong here,"And I don’t want to overstep. 

I’m 32 (f) still living with my mum. We’ve always had a fractious relationship, even when I was little, she’s always found me difficult and argumentative. 

When I was a teenager she left my dad and she had custody of me and my sister. My dad tried to commit suicide in front of me twice when my mum asked him for a divorce so it was kind of a no-brainer that we would live with her. 

Everything was okay until the man she left my dad for, left her for another woman. Then she started online dating. If she wasn’t dating somebody or didn’t have somebody validating her she was angry and hostile. If she did then she was just unavailable; for eg. I had norovrius when I was 16 and lost 14lbs in a week, she went on a second or third date with a guy during this and left me alone with a packet of instant mash potatoes in case I got my appetite back. I cried most of the night. 

We fought a lot when I was a teenager and it was mostly just awful. She threatened to punch me once because she said my hair was greasy, but she’s never actually laid a finger on me. She would tell me to pack my bags and leave and when I would do it she would tell me she didn’t mean it. She would push me to the edge and then tell me I was a mess. 

I moved out when I went to university but came back when I was 22. I moved out again when I was 27 after some horrendous arguments with her and lived with my brother for a few months with a view of getting on my feet and getting my own place but it didn’t pan out and I moved back in with my mum. 

So here I am, sat on the floor in the corner of my room, door shut, blanket over my head, just completely drained of tears. 32 years old. She started an argument with me, I didn’t agree with her on something and that was it. It ended with her telling me I make her a nastier person after I told her I just wanted to make her a calmer, happier person. She flies off the handle over so many things, I just felt like if I gave her some perspective maybe it would make her look at things differently rather than believing the world is out to get her. She wasn’t listening to me, just getting angrier and angrier, she then called me a bully. 

She can be a very nice person, and I am not without fault. She can also be a horrible person and I don’t always deserve the vitriol she throws at me. I lost my fucking mind a couple of months ago after she started an argument with me over me making a mess in the kitchen after cooking dinner for her, and I ended up shoving past her. I should not have been physical with her but it was perfect for her. She jumped on that. She was “scared” of me, “What is wrong with you?!????” “You need help!!!!”.

...

TLDR; I have no idea how to condense this. I’m just trying to make my head feel lighter right now. If you read this all, thank you. And I really need to pee but I don’t want to leave my room and see her.",sirjessica,2020-03-28 05:54:57,6,593,18.06,41.99,67.82,1.58,17.44,10.62,94.6,64.42,24.45,20.57,11.8,0.51,0.67,7.59,0,3.88,5.4,12.65,9.27,6.41,8.94,2.7,20.24,4.22,2.02,1.85,1.52,1.52,5.4,1.18,4.22,0.51,2.02,0.84,15.85,1.52,0.34,8.26,1.18,12.31,1.35,1.18,3.04,3.04,1.52,4.38,1.69,0.51,0.34,0.51,2.7,1.01,0.67,0.17,0.84,5.23,1.69,0.67,1.52,1.01,0.67,10.62,7.59,0.67,16.86,2.19,7.08,8.09,0.34,0.17,0.67,0,0,0.17,0.67,0.17,0.17,0.34,0,0,15.18,6.07,3.04,0,0.34,0.84,0.84,0.17,1.01,2.53,0.34,0
fql2iw,Need advice on finally leaving my Abusive Mother.,"So I'm in need of some advice. I'm 20 y/o (f) and have lived with my parents my whole life so far. My dad is a pretty passive person and doesn't really bother me so much. My mother, however, is a different story. She is controlling, manipulative and has been described as borderline abusive. 

My mother is like two different people in one body. She can be your best friend one day and be out to get you the next. She is the most charming person I have ever met and knows how to get people on her side. She can control any situation and has made, at this point, her whole side of the family think I am Lazy, spoilt and ungrateful. She puts on this act around people that she is a loving, doting mother that has the perfect family. Behind closed doors, however, she can be a horrible person. Now that I'm a little older I know how to get out of those situations. I can respond to her with non-nonchalantness and indifference. I'm old enough that I can remove myself from her when I need to, I have a car and can drive, I have friends I can stay with. 

I was planning to move out later this year with my partner and a friend of ours. I had saved up a little money and my job was stable enough that I could afford rent for most of the places around here. Now, of course, this virus has happened and I've lost my job for a while. I currently have no income. I have applied for government benefits like everyone else who has lost their job but it's uncertain if I will be accepted for that. My savings have gone to shit because I'm not getting money in to pay for my car etc. 

 I know that It's probably really stupid to leave blindly with no idea what the future holds but, tbh, I'm Just really sick of living like this. Walking on egg shells all the time, having to leave a room just because she walks into it and changes the atmosphere, Having to be guarded all the time in case I get manipulated, forcing myself to stay calm. I just want to feel comfortable in my own home. I can't express how frustrated I am. 

I would appreciate any advice on second Jobs I can apply for, \\i was thinking uber and stuff but I don't have a full licence so probably not uber. Or any advice for saving money or renting for the first time. Right now I put almost everything I make into my savings. 

many thanks in advance.",MeloCityChaos,2020-03-28 07:22:39,1,457,30.15,29.21,86.33,19.26,15.76,12.69,93.65,57.99,18.82,14.22,10.72,0.22,0.44,2.63,0.22,4.6,4.6,12.91,12.04,5.91,7.44,1.53,18.38,3.72,2.41,1.31,1.31,2.63,5.25,2.41,2.84,0.44,1.31,0.44,10.07,1.75,0.88,3.5,0.22,13.57,1.97,2.63,1.53,3.28,1.31,3.72,0.44,0.22,0,0.22,1.97,0.44,1.09,0,0.44,7,2.19,1.53,1.75,1.97,0.22,2.84,15.97,0.66,15.32,3.72,7.88,4.16,1.97,0.66,1.53,2.19,0,0,0.66,0.22,0.44,0,0,0,14.44,6.35,4.16,0,0,0,0,0.22,0,2.63,0.44,0.66

fqpzqx,my experience with munchausen syndrome by proxy,"I've always struggled with putting my experience into words, but finally was able to with this. Long read but my boyfriend said I should share this.

How to figure out you were medically abused as a child:

1. Suspect. You’ve always known something was off, but you can never seem to put it into words well enough for anybody around you to understand. You are a child, after all, and you don’t even know what emotional abuse is, let alone medical abuse. You don’t have bruises so you’re fine, right? That’s what your parents say, you’re just being dramatic and ungrateful and you need to calm down and why can’t you be easy like the other kids?
2. Take lots of medicine and trust your mom. While you know that other kids don’t have more medicine in their pill organizer than their grandparents, you also know that there’s something wrong with you and you have to take these pills to fix it. In less words, that’s what mom says, that’s what the psychiatrist says. You don’t know why you’re constantly so difficult but you don’t want to take the pills anymore. They make you feel groggy and you’re gaining so much weight and Mom keeps changing if you take them in the morning or night or split them up or start an old prescription again or up your dosage, just half a pill, because it doesn’t seem like this is working, you’re still being difficult. None of your siblings have this issue, why can’t you just be good like them?
3. Physical symptoms. You’re gaining more weight. You tell your mom and your doctor you don’t like the way this medicine makes you feel. They say you’re obese, that your diet is bad, that you need to be more active. You don’t know how to say that you feel tired and groggy and exhausted all the time because you just start sobbing out of frustration. What is wrong with you? Those words echo in your mind in your mother’s voice, but eventually fade into your own. What is wrong with you? Why does it feel hopeless to fix it? Nobody can hear you because you don’t even have the vocabulary to express what is happening. You feel so controlled, suppressed, puppeted, hopeless. You are not your own. You’re a minor, you can’t leave, you can’t say no, you can’t stop it. You just have to wait, you tell yourself. Eventually, you’ll be able to control your own body, your own life.
4. You’re obese. Childhood obesity, they say, and you know it’s a side effect from the medicine but nobody listens, they say it’s puberty. You get made fun of, a lot. By your siblings, your mom, the kids at school, everyone. You have to get a sonogram. Your sister tells you it’s because you’re so fat you look pregnant. Your mom sticks up for you, tells her to stop. She takes you to another doctor appointment, but this time it’s with your general practitioner. He explains they need to check on your organs with the sonogram and then take blood for diabetes. The doctor tells your mom that your body is putting on too much weight too fast and your organs are not growing at the same rate and are becoming stressed. You don’t know this, you just know you don’t have diabetes so maybe it will be okay.
5. You still don’t like taking the pills. Really, really don’t like it. You feel like a living vegetable, like you’re not aware of your surroundings or sometimes even in your body. You sleep all the time now. Days bleed together and you have a hard time remembering things. What did you have for dinner last night? What day is it? Does school start at 7:30 or 8:30 and why can you never focus enough to remember in the mornings? Meds, school, meds, sleep, repeat. You fall asleep during classes. Your grades start to slip. It feels like days are just a short time in between sleep. Where did the time go? Is it already spring? You get into a fight with your mom because you forgot to take your pills. You try to tell her that they make you feel bad. She and the doctor decide to give you the same pills but put them in a different bottle and tell you it’s a new prescription. Maybe it’ll make you less difficult about it. You think you’re taking different medicine now. Finally, you think, they listen to me. You don’t feel any different though. The thought that these pills look familiar doesn’t even cross your mind for weeks, after all you’re taking like 4 pills morning and night anyways how are you supposed to remember size, shape, color, and what’s engraved on each one?
6. You’re violent. It’s like you’re possessed by this angry, short-tempered, frustrated other you that just gets so upset and lashes out. You don’t know why. You wish you weren’t like this, you wish you were nice and kind like a disney princess but you find yourself in the villian’s shoes more often than not. It just goes to prove mom is right, there is something wrong with you. It’s like you can’t control yourself. Like you’re in survival mode. You’re so young and so angry. What is wrong with you?
7. You have to leave. Something bad happened and it went too far and now you have to go to a “home.” They say it’s a home for at-risk teens but you know it’s a modern mental institution in disguise. There, they don’t let you have your own bottles of soap or scarves or to be alone in the bathroom for more than 15 minutes. You’re monitored and recorded constantly but it’s nice to be away from your family for a bit. You miss them, but it’s not like they call or visit. You don’t know how long you’re here for, you know it’s long-term care but the end goal is always to put the child back with the family. That’s why you’re here and they’re not, there’s something wrong with you and not them. They keep your prescriptions pretty much the same, and you feel like you don’t see the therapist nearly as much as you did back home. These people are in control of you, of your meds now, and they will fix you but as you look around you see other kids with real problems. Physically or sexually abusive parents, lives that have been much harder than yours. You are ungrateful, why can’t you just behave at home? You seem to do well here, you’re excelling in the sub-par school they have, and you get along with most of the girls. You feel like it’s going to be okay, and this almost gives you a taste of what it’s like to be more in control of your life. A mental institution seems to give you more freedom than your mom.
8. It’s time to go home. You’ve been here just less than a year but you aren’t as violent or angry anymore. You’re pissed at the world for giving you this hand but it feels like it’s going to get better. Your family just had a new baby and you’re better now and it’s going to be better.
9. Everyone was better off without you. You and your mom are fighting again and she’s already changed your pills from when you were in care and she just pointed out that the family didn’t have these issues when you were gone. They were doing better without you. You’re the problem, and you don’t know how not to be. You thought it would be better, you were hopeful, but everyone constantly tells you that you’re mean and difficult and terrible and seriously what is wrong with you?
10. Your parents are getting a divorce. It’s your fault they got married, because your mom was pregnant with you. That’s why she doesn’t like you, you think. She’s told you before that she cried on her wedding day but she was forced to get married, because of you, growing in her stomach. It makes you wish you were never born. You love your family. You’re a child, and they are your family, of course you love them. You just wish it didn’t hurt so much. Your mom gets custody of the kids but you’re old enough to choose who to live with yet it’s so hard to leave all of your siblings. You know if you do, you won’t get to be a part of the new baby’s life, of your younger sister and brother’s lives. You try to stick it out.
11. You can’t do this. What is wrong with you, why can’t you just be good? You want to leave but you don’t want to abandon your siblings. And you love your mom, you know that you leaving would break her heart. Sure, she’s controlling and you fight but she’s still your mom. You know it’s best for both of you if you leave though. Everyone is better off without you and it’s selfish of you to stay.
12. You tell your mom. Somehow it ends up as her kicking you out. She leaves and tells you to have everything of yours packed in the truck by the time she gets back. She takes you across town to your dad’s new house, and drops you off with your boxes on the front porch. Your dad isn’t home yet. She leaves. You’re scared, and sad, and you know you won’t talk to or see your mom for years.
13. It gets better. You let go of some of the frustration, the anger. You practically take care of yourself now. You’re still a minor, but you’re in high school and it feels like your life is your own. You stop taking the medicine. You feel okay, good even. You get taller and slim out. You feel confident, or about as confident as you can. You make friends and have a social life and get a job and a relationship.
14. You start to talk about your “childhood.” You’re still a child, still a minor, but it feels like you’ve grown up now. You tell your friends about some of the crazy stuff your mom did and said, half like it’s a joke and half like it’s whatever. They look at you like you’re insane. You laugh it off.
15. You graduate high school. Your mom comes to the ceremony but leaves before you walk. Why does it feel like she’s still making you beg for her to care? Oh well, you’re over it. You’re an adult now, you are in control of your body and your life and you haven’t taken meds in a couple of years and you finally feel like you’re awake and yourself.
16. You leave again. This time it’s halfway across the country. You move as far away as you can. You love it. It was easier to leave this time, and it was your choice. How much control you have over your own life continues to amaze you.
17. You meet someone. You connect in a way that you never have before. You feel held, you feel loved, you feel supported. It’s serious. You realize that you don’t think anyone has ever loved and cared for you. You’ve always had to care for yourself, and having someone show you what it means to be loved really emphasises how bad it used to be.
18. You have to do it. You have to go back to therapy. It’s hard, because it’s the tool your mom used to control you. But you cry all the time, you have nightmares almost every night, you feel like you’re not in control of your emotions anymore. What is wrong with you? Why do you feel like you’ve never had feelings before this? Is it possible you were so medicated and suppressed that you didn’t experience full emotions? Why does your heart hurt and feel so heavy? Why doesn’t your mom love you? Why doesn't she care? How could she do this to you, how could she hurt you like that?
19. You learn what Munchhausen syndrome by proxy is. You think, maybe that’s what happened, but it seems like a physical illness kind of thing, not mental illness like you experienced. You go to therapy and you talk about what happened but you don’t bring up Munchhausen's, you’re too scared and you don’t want to suggest it. Your therapist does.
20. You research. Hours of tears, recovered memories, other people’s experiences, and heartbreak lead you to a story about another child who experienced Munchhausen by proxy exclusively through mental illness. It mirrors your life almost exactly. You read that the violence was because of a child-like fight or flight instinct that kids in these circumstances can experience. You feel a weight off your shoulders. There is nothing wrong with you. Your heart breaks. There is nothing wrong with you. You were a child. It was not your fault. You pity your childhood self, that poor sad child who blamed and hated herself.
21. You have to start taking medicine again. It’s hard and scary and every morning you have to remind yourself what the pills are for and that it’s your choice and you are in control and that they can help when used correctly, like now. You’re depressed and you have tried so hard to be okay but you need help and you know that this will help. Your loved one reminds you that you are loved and that it’s okay and that it’s your choice. They are always there and your heart hurts as you remember what it’s like to be uncared for. You are grateful.
22. It gets better. You’re happy, you’re healthy, and you’re healing. You can finally talk about what happened without breaking down. You’re still scared to tell people that it's “suspected” MBP because you can’t prove it and maybe they won’t believe you or will think you’re exaggerating or making it up but all that matters is that you know. There’s nothing wrong with you.
23. You finally have the words. You can put it into words, what it was, what happened. It feels like another life now. Everything is going to be okay. You’re sad sometimes, you’re upset sometimes, you’re happy sometimes. You are able to make your own life choices now and everything is going to be okay. You will never feel fully healed, but you will get to a point that you feel good. You are loved and you love yourself and everything is okay now. You are healing.",throwawayuser74892,2020-03-28 11:49:57,3,2477,9.98,99,27.43,22.64,11.26,12.15,94.79,62.09,25.35,17.36,0.24,0,14.86,1.09,1.17,7.99,3.59,12.03,12.15,6.46,7.55,3.03,22.04,5.41,3.43,2.26,1.37,1.66,6.74,3.23,3.43,0.36,0.81,0.81,23.42,1.94,0.12,2.1,0.24,13.97,3.59,2.54,0.93,2.46,1.57,4.12,3.15,0.36,0.65,1.82,4.44,0.81,2.87,0.12,0.97,7.31,1.7,1.01,2.26,2.06,1.25,2.91,18.17,0.97,11.47,1.9,4.28,5.49,1.05,0.44,0.61,0.04,0,0,0.57,0.04,0,0.32,0.16,0.04,20.51,7.87,4.6,0.12,0,0.97,0,0.2,0.24,6.5,0,0

fqxsb9,"(Tw I think) Was I sexually abused, sexually assaulted, raped, something else, or nothing at all?","Ever since I was twelve my step brother has been inappropriate to me. I'm now 16. He touches me without asking my permission (not that I'd ever give it to him anyway) and I've tried slapping his hand away and telling him to stop on multiple occasions, but he still does. He touches my chest and my butt and when no one is around he sneaks up behind me and humps me from behind and wont let me go for a good 40 seconds at least even though I push him. He constantly takes out his penis and waves it in my face and I tell him to stop but he doesnt. 2 years ago he threatened me that if I told on him then he was not only going to tell them it was my fault and that I was willing, but also that he would have sex with me when I turned 16. I'm 16 and he hasnt ever actually forced me or anything, but literally everything else besides sex, he has probably done to me. He even forced his penis in my mouth and when he did that we were outside and he followed me outside into the woods behind the house. 

I'm scared everytime I see him that he will continue to do the things he does. I cant leave my room without my heart racing. As of writing this I am in the bacement cause we are home alone by ourselves and I dont want to be on the same floor level as him. It's cold down here. I'm uncomfortable and I'm scared.

I cant tell anyone about it because 1 he followed through with his first threat when I told him I didnt want him doing that to me anymore and he told our parents that it was my fault and he was innocent and the police ended up getting involved. I was punished for a year because they thought that I was willing when he did this stuff. And 2 i cant stir up 3 year old memories and hurt my family. I dont want my father or step mother to get hurt because of me on top of everything else like my depression that hurts them.

This is still happening. I dont know what to do to make it stop. Hes 18. I'm 16. If you want to do the math to see how old he was before hand then you can. But he turned 18 this last feburary so its technically illegal for him right? Regardless I cant tell anyone.

fqy9x3,Is my [32F] marriage to my husband [35M] abusive? Or am I annoying?,"My   husband tends to break or destroy objects when he gets upset. I once    was talking to myself about dishes and said ""Looks like I have to wash    the dishes again"". He then smashed a hole in my coffee table (but he  did   replace and pay me back). Not sure if this is normal male behavior     though.

And once when I was  just    gently telling him that cigars are bad for him, he got angry and   stormed   off to the second bedroom. I went in to grab a book of mine   and other   stuff of mine cause that was my home office. As I disturbed   his nap, he went to go rip up our   marriage certificate. We then went   into the office to fill out a new one   two days later.

Last week, we had a argument over the phone regarding my fear of the coronavirus, and he threw his phone and broke a picture frame and poster. Was it me though? I must have angered him a lot to do this.

Is   this normal behavior? And be honest if I did anything wrong- like if I   disturbed his nap. Situations like this are starting to escalate after   we got married 10 months ago.

fqzn4m,Is this actual abuse? Advice needed ;w;,"Honestly I don't know how to start or what to say. It's too much. But I wanna know, if it's really my fault or my parent's. I'm a 16 y/o female and my family is Korean. (Asian culture) It's horrible. One of my parents have high expectations from me. Since the day I was born, my parents have been working hard like good and responsible parents. They give me food, they buy me what I want (but i don't ask for much), basically they spoil me. But no matter what I do, one of them is always disappointed. When I say disappointed, it's screaming, anger, hitting, crying, guilttripping i suppose, ect. It makes me feel like shit because I know where they are coming from. It makes sense. 

They say that they work their ass off, they feel humiliated bc i ain't shit, they can't even brag about me to their friends(god fucking damn koreans..it's always about bragging.) They tell me they want to kill themselves every single fucking day. Well guess what. So do I. 

In general, they think I'm actually a stupid fuck. It's horrible. They keep threatening that they're going to kill themselves. And honestly, I wish. Ever since I was in 7th grade, I wanted to kill myself. I've wanted to, but I won't do it because I know better. But what am I supposed to do in a situation like this? Like god, I'm not perfect but not stupid either. I just wish one of us would leave. It would be so much peaceful. 


It's stressful to the point I have to overdose on ventolin every once in a while. It's more verbal than hitting. But i don't know. Is it really my fault that I'm not like the other girls of my age? Sometimes, even if I try, i can't change my grades. Like what am I supposed to do? They told me to kill myself if I don't get over a 95 in maths (as a joke probably but like what the fuck am I supposed to do). I'm not gonna work my ass off at smth I know that won't change anything. Not everything is for everyone. Some things can be for me, other things no. 


I don't know what to do. I don't know if this is considered abuse? Like I know I deserve it. But sometimes I think it gets too.. too much.. Let me tell you how much I mean that. When my parent tries to hit me, no matter how much it hurts. I fucking take it. Because I know i deserve it. But even after that, the verbal shit is nonstop. 

I'd rather get fucking hit for 5 minutes than a 2 hour ""lecture"". 

They complain about me sleeping all the time. The only reason why I sleep so much is because I sleep during the day bc I hate her face. I mean it. I hate it. I'm sorry that I brought your life into such a mess, you should've aborted me. Your fault? 

It's to the point where I don't know what to do. I can graduate in 2 years and move out. But I can't. I know there aren't many options. So fuck me :)

Just wanted to get confirmation whether its my fault that I deserve this treatment or the way the parent raised me",sirwooflers,2020-03-28 21:15:00,1,572,6.85,3.89,93.45,1,9.53,12.06,93.88,61.89,27.45,18.71,14.34,0.17,0.7,0.17,3.32,8.74,3.32,10.31,11.19,5.94,6.99,3.85,22.55,4.55,2.62,3.15,1.75,2.62,8.39,1.57,6.82,0.87,4.2,0.87,8.57,1.22,0.17,0.52,0,19.06,3.67,2.97,3.15,3.32,1.57,6.64,1.57,0,0.7,0.7,3.15,1.57,0.17,1.22,0.17,5.77,1.57,1.05,1.22,1.4,0.87,2.45,18.53,1.57,8.74,1.4,3.32,4.02,1.57,0.35,0.17,0.17,0.35,0.7,3.5,2.27,0.87,0,0.17,0,23.25,9.79,4.2,0,0.35,1.05,0,0,0.35,5.94,1.4,0.17
fr1dfm,Just Got Off The Phone With My Dad (Massive Trigger Warning) Please Provide Emotional Support,"Trigger warning for anyone who's been abused. There's some specific content in here you might not want to read because it could be triggering as hell.

I just had a two hour phone call with my Dad. I was trying to see if we could somehow mend our relationship.

I brought up a time when I was 17 and I went to him for help because I was having thoughts of suicide. And he literally told me ""Alright then, maybe you should just kill yourself!"".

I wanted closure and I wanted some sort of healing for the relationship. I brought it up in a very adult way and not in a way where I was attacking him.

He denied the event at first. Then, when I kept pushing and telling him it did happen, after he tried to change the subject multiple times, and that I have a really good memory for conversation, he ended up saying ""The only way I would ever have said that would be if someone was really pushing my buttons and they just kept digging and digging."".

So he's basically implying that it's my own fault that he encouraged me to kill myself. I was a 17 year old kid and he was an adult. Needless to say his behavior towards me at the time and growing up was a large part of the reason why I wanted to kill myself and why I have mental health issues to this day.

When I gently called him out on it and pointed out that a child is a child and it's an adult's responsibility to rationally deal with the situation, he said ""If you ever have your own kids and they start pushing your buttons and screaming and having temper tantrums and you explode at them, you'll understand."" So he's admitting that he has a belief system where it's understandable and justifiable for an adult to attack a child.

I tried to reason with him, but the response I got was ""You're being insensitive like you always are. You were always the master of ruining good moments and ruining good situations. I was never like this with your sister."".

So he's basically implying that when I was even a small child it was my own fault that he would lash out at me.

And he was rubbing in something that plagued me for my whole childhood leaving me with a question which haunted me for decades ""What is wrong with me?"". Which was amplified by both my parents treating my sister completely differently and in a seemingly more loving way than they treated me.

That behavior from him caused me to internalize everything and to think that there was something wrong with me.

Towards the end of the phone call, he was telling me that I was now the one ruining the good moment and that we were having a reasonable conversation and I was being insensitive and pushing his buttons.

I hung up the phone with a mixture of emotions. I'm glad that I now know he's the crazy one and not me. 

There was a beautiful movie I watched which was based on a play. It was called ""The Effects Of Gamma Radiation On Man In The Moon Marigolds"". In the movie, there was a crazy mother who always put down her own kids. Her teenage daughter found out through school, as she went to the same school her own mother had gone to, that her mother was previously referred to as Betty the Loon. She expressed this to her mother and it helped her finally realise that her mother was the crazy one. She said something along the lines of ""You're the crazy one. Betty The Loon! You always call us crazy and put us down. But really, you're the one who's crazy. Betty The Loon."".

That movie was a pivotal moment for me. I discovered it at just the right time. It helped me realize that I'm not crazy. And that there's nothing wrong with me after all.

However, despite the fact that I'm almost 30, and that I now know there's nothing wrong with me, and that him and Mom are the ones who need help, although they refuse to get help, despite that fact the conversation still got to me.

It brought up that old feeling of helplessness and frustration. It was strange to think that as a child I felt that way all the time. And I felt that way a lot as an adult. Even though there was never any reason for me to feel bad about myself, I somehow internalized it and it's still affecting me way into my adulthood.

As a child, I couldn't even articulate exactly what my parents were doing to me, because I didn't quite understand. I just knew that I felt bad about myself and was somehow angry at them for reasons I didn't understand.

I guess I'm coming to realize that even though I consciously no longer believe all their manipulation and the belief system that resulted out of always being put down, always being blamed, never having my needs met and watching my sister be treated like an angel while I was treated like garbage, I still have that belief system subconsciously but it's slowly changing.

But I still have those moments where I look at myself in the mirror and I don't like what I see. I'm uncomfortable with my own masculinity, I feel dirty and I feel like there's something that makes me not worth it.

Sometimes I punch myself in the face. I feel like I'm always doing something wrong. In fact, I think I'm even drawn to situations where I am increasing the feelings of something being wrong with me or that I'm doing something wrong. Things like substance abuse, relationships where I'm abused or even degrading sexual scenarios. That stuff somehow still draws me in.

But I'm working on all of that. It's slowly improving. Though sometimes I worry that I'm going to spend my whole life trying to improve. In the meanwhile I've already missed out on much of what life has to offer. Because I spent most of my life shrouded in feelings of guilt and shame.

I'm almost 30 and this is me right now. A complete mess.

But it does feel good that I can have a conversation with my Dad and not get pulled along emotionally like I used to. I can stay calm and see what he's doing and that what he's doing is mental abuse and that I don't deserve it.

And I can now understand it, explain it and work through it as an adult instead of with the mind of a scared and broken child. I can finally heal, even if it's happening slowly.

But I'm left with one burning question, the same question I had since I was a little kid. The same question I've been trying to answer with every abusive relationship.

""WHY?""

Why does another human being treat someone else like that? I'm not like him. I've never been like that. Of course it's clear he will never answer any of those questions.

But, seriously, I still want to know and understand. Is there something wrong with him? Is it a mental disorder? Was he the victim of abuse and neglect? Did he get lead poisoning as a child? Is he a psychopath?

And I think I'm getting to the point where I am going to have to accept that I'll never have the answer.

I think the only reason I even reached out to him, which I even told him on the call, was that I'm terrified I will go the rest of my life without talking to him. And that he will die and I will feel guilty for not having a relationship with him.

But, clearly, that can't happen because he won't admit he has done anything wrong. He's being a wordsmith and using blanket statements and clever phrases. And even after this whole conversation, right when I was about to hang up, he said ""I love you."".

In the same conversation where he told me it was my own fault he always lashed out at me and that it was my own fault he told me to kill myself. By the way, later that day after that half of my family had a massive fight, I was in the bathroom with a box cutter. I was reciting lines from the movie Air Bud where the kid was talking to the dog. ""Just like we always do."" I was planning on slashing either my wrists or my throat. I was repeating to myself over and over again ""Come on bud, just like we always do."". Because I was trying to normalize what I was about to do and feel okay with it. But then I was interrupted by a knock on the bathroom door. I kicked the box cutter under the sink. It's probably still there to this day.

The cops were in the house and banging on the bathroom door. I had tears in my eyes. I just opened the door and they asked what was going on. I guess the neighbors had called because of the noise from me, Dad and his girlfriend fighting. They asked what was going on and I just said we had a fight. And the officer just said ""Okay well we're here now so I guess you guys must have learned what happens when you have a fight outside."". Our fight had mostly happened in the backyard where the neighbors could be. I had tears in my eyes and the officer didn't even ask a single other question. To this day, that's why I have a disdain for law enforcement (and a few other similar situations).

There was endless abuse in my childhood. This is just the tip of the iceburg.

So in the same conversation where my Dad said it was my fault for him encouraging me to kill myself when I was close to my wits end, he also said ""I love you."".

There was endless abuse in my childhood, but this conversation is a pretty good example of just how sick my Dad can be.

I guess I'm still not sure where I'm going with this. But I guess I still have a burning question ""why"". The answer to that question, I keep feeling would help me regulate my response. Do I press charges for childhood stuff, do I never talk to him again? And so on.

Now correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm starting to suspect that my good old Dad knows exactly what I would do and what the answer to the question is. The answer to the question is that it eases his pain when he abuses me. He uses me as a bandaid. And he will never ever admit it, because as soon as he admits it, he will lose his power over me and he will lose the tourniquet that he can use to bandaid his own wounds. Because without me wanting closure, there's no contact. And if there's no contact, there's no one to abuse. Whether or not he is doing this consciously or subconsciously is a whole different question. But he would have to have moments of clarity where he sees what he was doing even if it was subconsciously. And he is consciously chosing to keep doing what he does.

So I guess the answer to why, if it was ever spoken, would be ""I feel good and ease my own pain with no regard for you when I abuse you."". That's the entire unspoken truth of the foundation of our ""relationship"".

""I feel good when I abuse you. And I have a sick belief that this is love. I have no trouble justifying my behavior because it's easy and I'm a coward.""

Please fellow Redditors, I know this is a brand new account but I promise I'm not making this up. Can I get some help, encouragement or suggestions about how to handle this situation?

I think going no contact (again) is really the best idea because I can't have a relationship with someone who just wants to abuse me. Even if it is my own Dad. I could use some validation there as well. It's tough though because I still have some sort of hope for the love I never had and some strange feelings that I love him even when I simultaneously hate him and it's really confusing.

fr1utb,Abusive Dad showed his true self tonight.,"So over the years I’ve grown up I known one thing my dad was a man who would put his fingers on my mom. Yes he’s beaten her and yea she called the cops one time and dropped the charges. I was 11 the last time it happened. I’m now 21, returned home from college early because of corona and all I worried about was how I was going to return to an abusive household with a abusive father. I have three younger siblings, but I am the person who truly saw my dad over the past years. I thought he changed, but tonight he showed he’s the same person.

My parents recently got into this argument about finances and yes I will admit my dad pays most of the house bills, but my mom also has her bills and provides for me and my 4 siblings. My dad paid about 30k in four years for my school as well and that is what holds me back from talking bad on him. Like I’m literally unable cause he paid for my school.

Here’s where things went rough. Tonight my mom came home late from her shift as a nurse. Tired and exhausted but ready for bed I hear my parents arguing in the room. I then hear my dad slam open the door and is literally in front of my mom. This happens I usually just push my dad back. I leave the room alert my siblings that my dad is having another of his occurrences. This time he goes into the bathroom and starts chocking all the air out my mother. I come in instant reaction try my best to get him off her. I try strangling him with the best of my ability and he finally lets go. Well domestic abuse, domestic assault whatever you call it, happened. My mom was literally struggling for air. There are still bruises on her kneck after the incident. The thing is she doesn’t want me to call the police, but what do I do? I know my parents are not from here so they don’t understand the legal system the best way. I don’t know what to do? Should I call the cops?

fr99zh,Is this abuse?,"Some background information: I'm a college student who takes classes part time and works part time and I live with my family. I work at a grocery store, which is considered an essential service, but ever since the coronavirus pandemic happened, my parents have been yelling at me demanding that I quit my job, telling me that I'll kill everyone if I go to work. None of us have any major health problems that would classify us as being high-risk, and my parents still leave the house whenever they want. I don't make much money and can't afford to quit my job, but they keep on yelling at me that if anyone dies it'll be my fault and they also told me they won't help me if I get sick. This isn't the first time they've ever gotten angry at me and yelled at me, but the past few weeks they've been screaming at me every day and telling me I'm selfish and stupid and spoiled. 

I don't have a lot of money and they're not the type to prepare for stuff and rarely go and buy food so if I don't work, I'll run out of food eventually.

frerek,My cousin scarred me for life (assault),"First I want to say that what i am about to say happend a long time ago. I still from time to time remember it. I tried forgetting it or pretended to make something of it that isnt the truth. 

When I was around 10 years old a cousin of mine (girl) watched me and my sister when my mom was not home. I am a child of divorce and I have seen lots of abuse and violence in my younger years. On a particular night my little sister was already asleep. My cousin thought it would be funny to play a game. She would like me to undress myself and she would do that to. Then i have to lay on the couch while she jumps naked on me (in a sitting position). I realise now that she was using me for sexual pleasure. This happend 3 times and then it kinda stopped after I said that I dont feel comfortable and that I will tell mom id she doesnt stop. It was really weird, almost as if it didnt happen. I was ashamed and felt very dirty about it. I never told my mom or anyone. 

I feel that that experience ruined my innocence very early on. I wish it never happend. Today I am 17 years old and I have such a problem with creating normal relations with people. Boys literally scare me and I dont like love in any way. Eventhough I have desires and all that I still cant even bring myself to hold hands with someone. I dont know if its the divorce of my parents or the experience with my niece that resulted in me being the way I am. I hope someone has some type of advise. My cousin is now 25 or something like that she is married and has child.

frfk5y,This is long but I am REALLY struggling.,"I (30/F) have been with my BF (45/M) for 9 years. I spent my entire 20s with him and spent a good 8 of those 9 years absolutely ADORING HIM. It has always felt like there is an imbalance in our relationship of how much I care for him versus how much he cares for me.....but he is a very stoic non affectionate type of person so I have always assumed that he loves me just as much but struggles to show it. We have made many amazing memories together and because of the age difference he has taught me a lot...he is kind of all I know.....he is very loyal and hardworking...he has a lot of integrity and I respect him a great deal...

...BUT...

It is becoming more and more apparent day after day that he treats me like shit. He tells me to ""shut up"" mid sentence almost daily. He uses dirty looks and even physical gestures of intimidation to quiet me. He says insensitive harsh things to me often about my personality, the way I do things and my family. He has made NO EFFORT AT ALL to get to know or spend any time around my family. I have to BEG him for affection that is never really given to me and our sex life has taken a huge hit. Nothing I do ever seems good enough for him. I often times feel belittled and disrespected. When I try to set boundaries we fight....all we do lately is bicker and fight. I feel like he lectures me and nags me CONSTANTLY. It is very VERY clear to me that this is an abusive relationship. I believe that I deserve better and can't see myself living like this for the rest of my life.....

SO....why can't I leave?? Everytime I think about seriously leaving and what that would look like I am overcome with sadness, fear and grief. I KNOW that he is abusive and I KNOW that he doesn't treat me right...I KNOW that both of us are unhappy and have no problem admitting he is an asshole...but he is my asshole though.....When I picture my life without him in it I cry. I actually really love him as a person and I hate to imagine a life where I dont ever get to see him again OR a scenario where he is sad and heartbroken because of the break up....

I feel like I can't stay but I can't leave......so almost every single day he does or says  something that really crosses the line and upsets me and frustrates me...but then on the flip side almost every day there is a point in the day where he says or does something that makes me remember why I love him so much. 

This relationship is actually toxic as fuck...it has killed my spirit and drained me physically and emotionally in many ways.....but I feel like he is my person...he is the only person who really knows and gets me....sometimes I wonder if maybe I am just as toxic as him at the end of the day...somehow making us a perfect fit????.. There have been times I think maybe I am just overreacting and have seriously had to question my own behaviour.amd standards. 

I have talked to him about amicably breaking up and he has made it very clear to me that if we do breakup it is going to be a nasty angry encounter. I dont know what to do anymore and why I am struggling so much to let go of someone who makes me feel like shit all the time????  You hear of couples who get to the end of a relationship and just hate each other......I love him soo much still and feel like I SHOULDN'T!!! What tf is the deal with that? 

This is the first time I have ever really admitted all of this and put it into words. I have read ""Why Does He Do That""...I have listened to podcasts about abuse and narcissism. I have been in an abusive relationship before as a teenager and went through therapy to overcome the trauma from that. I have read books about codependency....so if I know all of this THEN WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME? Why when he treats me like such shit and I start to consider leaving, do I start to suddenly get nostalgic about better times we have shared (even though if I really analyze those times they weren't even that great to begin with). 

I am really REALLY struggling with this and don't know what to do. 

TLDR - Boyfriend is an absolute abusive asshole and we are in a toxic relationship but the thought of leaving seems impossible to me because i would be too heartbroken...wtf is wrong with me",AlexisTexas82,2020-03-29 16:18:30,4,835,14.62,27.47,67.43,2.5,23.19,13.05,94.25,63.95,22.28,16.29,10.3,1.2,0.12,4.55,0.12,5.99,4.43,11.74,9.58,9.22,8.98,1.8,20,3.83,2.75,2.51,0.84,2.99,7.66,2.51,5.15,0.72,2.75,0.84,10.54,0.24,0.24,0,4.79,16.05,3.95,2.04,1.08,3.59,2.75,4.67,2.63,0.96,0.72,0.96,2.87,0.72,1.32,0.36,0,7.43,3.35,0.84,1.56,1.56,0.36,2.4,15.93,0.36,10.42,1.44,3.47,5.51,0.96,0.48,0.24,0.36,0.12,0.24,1.56,1.08,0.48,0.12,0,0,19.52,14.85,0.36,0,0,1.44,0.36,0.12,0.48,0.96,0.72,0.24

frfwtu,Not sure if my father is an abuser.,"Hi all - this may take a long to communicate so forgive me in advance. I am a 30-year-old man, and questioning whether or not my father is manipulative and/or abusive. To provide context, he was very hard to be around growing up at times. My first encounter with anxiety was when I was around him. While many times of correction were warranted, there were many times that his demeanor towards me in disagreement was cold, belittling, and usually about getting to the ""root issue"". If I didn't see things his way, he would usually claim I was not being internally honest. We had bouts of very tense moments until I moved out years ago. 

Presently, I have a wife and a daughter and have not had to experience this side of my father for awhile until this week.

On Sunday my wife, daughter, and I went to my parent's house for dinner. The discussion of the Corona Virus came up. My father, per usual, was speaking with authority on the matter. I didn't feel the need to press him or challenge him because I know how he can get. Instead, my wife tried to present some info that she believed was being dismissed because of the way my father was framing his stance. My father interrupted her and didn't quite let her get her points out adequately. It seemed disrespectful of my father, but I am somewhat accustomed to this. That night when we went home, I asked my wife how she took the conversation, in respect to her. She admitted, and I validated, that it can be challenging to talk to my father if there is potential for disagreement. But we moved on and that was that.

On Wednesday I was dropping off my daughter at my parent's house. Was happy to see them, and I was ready to get to work until my dad hovered around me and finally asked if he could speak with me. He asked if my wife and I were offended by the conversation on Sunday night. I responded that we were not, but that he can make it challenging to speak with. To which he began going on a tangent about how my wife's data was anecdotal, and his data was factual. I responded that while I agreed with many of his points, that a lot of his data seemed to align with his conservatism, and that the info my wife was sharing had a place. Essentially my father believes Covid-19 is being blown out of proportion and that it is not a real threat or danger to healthy/young people. My wife, a medical professional, brought up a small sample size of young people with no health issues who have died and/or been put on ventilators. This is what my father had a problem with. So as the disagreement began to intensify, I said I think we are just going to disagree. So he puts on this hurt face and asks to speak to me upstairs (alone). This, upon thinking about the past, is something he has done to save face and to keep others from hearing his manipulative behavior (according to me). He began to corner me and press me, when I wanted to settle on a disagreement. He began to act as though my wife and I were conspiring against him and I think the reality is that he was offended that she may have tried to share info that might undermine him. He said that my wife ""focused on the negative"", and that he was making his points about the virus out of love for my wife and I... not sure about that. So as respectfully as I could, while being frustrated, I tip toed around the fact that because of the way he frames things, it might prompt differing opinions. He then brought up that Wikipedia was one of his sources, and he then compared Corona to the flu. I said that I thought that was misinformation, as I see it used a lot by conservative folks (no offense conservatives!) who are weaponizing that comparison to make it look like liberals are behind all of this, which isn’t a strong data point (according to me). So my father began claiming I was attacking him, and insulting him. He continued to interrupt me as I would try to explain and reason with him. He brought up that he isn’t a perfect man but that he is too good a father to be treated this way, which confused me. I told him we weren’t offended and that this was more about him taking offense. Finally he became aggressive in his wording and his facial expressions, and would not let me express myself. It was at this point I raised my voice and told him that he was being manipulative and blame shifting. I told him I was done with the conversation, and I calmly walked out, went downstairs and got my daughter, and calmly left. Upon telling him I was done with the conversation he snidely said “find you cane leave”, and as I walked down the hall way he called me arrogant”.

A few moments later my mother texts me and says that my father does not deserve to be treated that way, and that I should not have “stormed out on him”. My father later texts me something similar and said that I called him a “right winger”. So it seemed to me that my father was rationalizing to not only himself, but to my mother and other family members who were staying with him. I did not storm out. I walked away from an unhealthy conversation. I also did not call him a right winger, I do not use that language. But I believe he is framing me to excuse the aggression that he started speaking with. He wants to claim that I am the emotional one that attacked him, insulted him, etc. Instead, I told him that I was being assertive because he had become belittling, unreasonable, and manipulative. He later claims that it is not my place to hold him accountable for not living up to my standards during the conversation about Corona on Sunday with my wife. But that is a fallacy to begin with. I wasn’t offended. It seems like he is twisting things, when in reality he did not like that my wife “retorted him” or that I did not tolerate his demeanor towards me on Wednesday.

We agreed to meet on Friday morning. My hope was for reconciliation. I spoke with my brother about it, and he challenged me as a Christian to honor my father and to do my best to be humble. This was my hope. Considering the nature of his claims that I said and did things that I believed I did not, I decided to record the conversation. I had never done this before, but felt the level of blame shifting and dysfunction warranted that I use a neutral source to revert to in case my father was demeaning and inappropriate again. So our conversation starts by me explaining how much I love my father. Telling him that no matter how things shake out, that I want to respect him as best I can… he then starts the conversion telling me that I need to take ownership about how I attacked him and was inappropriate with him, and how I called him a right winger. I expected this. I told him I did not, and that I do not use that language at all, and he continued to say that labeling someone is offensive. So I asked him why that is the case, even if I did call him right wing, why is that so offensive, especially in light of what he calls liberal people. So for the next half hour I endured tangent after tangent of why my dad’s logic is superior bc he took some Penn State classes on logic, how he did not like that my wife rebutted him after he “so lovingly was trying to help us understand the data”. I tried to be agreeable where I could, and tell my father I agreed with some of the good stuff he was saying, until he started making claims that Corona was not dangerous and that he felt like I was trying to defend that my wife made a case that it could be dangerous. I told him defending my wife is exactly what I was doing, because I do believe it could still be dangerous to all people, including young people. He then started speaking down to me like I was stupid, interrupting me, being impatient with me, and speaking condescendingly. I tried to keep composure, and I said “pops I just think we are defining dangerous differently”. I said I believe we don’t know enough about it yet to make absolute statements and that I believe it can be dangerous in a broad sense (financially, physically, contagion, etc.). He became very haughty and said we do know enough to make statements, and proceeded to look up a definition of the word “dangerous” and conveniently uses the definition that indicates that danger is only correlated to mortality rates, rather than an overarching threat or unpleasant situation which appears in other definitions. (SORRY TO VOMIT ALL THIS INFO).

It was precisely at this point that that I said, “pops maybe this is exactly why my wife brought up her data points that you think are anecdotal”. I begged him to let me make my point after he interrupted me. And he scolded me with a terrible look on his face and said “you can make one more point”. And I calmly said, when you go on a tangent and come off that you are an expert, that you are the one that has the resources, it can be so polarizing that it makes someone want to present info that could be a blind spot. Maybe that’s what my wife was doing?”. At this point he became very stern, and seemingly abusive as he talked at me and over me, saying that I insulted him and attacked him. I am not sure what was so terrible about my assessment. After all, he asked if we were offended and I was trying to speak honestly about what I assessed. It is not my ever-present burden to critique my father for his every move, nor hold him accountable, unless his disrespect and belittling is directed toward me or someone I love. I still struggle with this because my father is still texting me to take ownership of how wrong I was for a variety of ways, acting as if it was my emotion that escalated that arguments, acting as if I provoked him, acting as if by recording the conversation I had a secret plan. None of that is true. I sat as my father berated me,acted demeaning, and degraded me verbally until it was finally time to draw boundaries. I find it ironic that he claims that because of my recording the conversation that I wasn’t truly trying to reconcile, meanwhile he started the entire conversation on Friday with forcing me into an apology without ever asking what it was that caused me to speak so firmly and to raise my voice. I did raise my voice with him at one point on Wednesday and another on Friday, after he was trying to talk over me and was not letting me speak. I am still praying and thinking about if I was wrong. I’ve spoken with my brother about this and he continues to challenge me to honor my father. I just don’t know how to move forward at this point. I don’t feel I was wrong in raising my voice or in recording the conversation considering the many times my father has manipulated and treated me similarly in the past. I don’t feel I was wrong in becoming assertive, or speaking my opinion as I did, after my father cornered my and pressed me.

I think the most unsettling thing that my father did was take so much offense at my remark about his tangents, and how he can come off as an expert without regard to the intelligent people around him (including my wife who is brilliant), he yelled “silence”. We were both frustrated, I get it. So I asked if he would like to end the conversation, and he cut me off again saying “silence, all I want is silence”. I said sure, I think I am going to go”…. “Silence” “silence” “silence”. So I calmly got up, opened the door and said “I love you pops, I hope you have a good day”. He then said, “see there you go again, walking away from me. How disrespectful. I didn’t ask you to leave, and you storm out of our conversation”. At this point I became very firm and raised my voice, I said “this is what you do, you manipulate, you twist things, and you demean people. Look at your relationships. You victimize yourself, and yet you attack and belittle people. I asked you what you wanted to do, and you want me to sit while you berate me and then sit in your silence?”. I then walked out.

A few moments later, my father texts me saying I need to come back to help watch my daughter because all of a sudden my mother had things to do. At this point I walk back in the house, calmly and my mom and dad tried to resume the conversation. At this point my father’s countenance changed. He tried to act caring. But I did not want to talk. So as I picked up my daughter he and my mother were trying to corner me and I asserted 4-5 times that I did not want to talk. They kept pressing, so I left after telling them both I love them.

I listened to the recording with my wife. It was clear that my father was out of line to us. My dad is saying recording the conversation was a serious breach of trust. He keeps wanting me to own my “mistakes”. I wrestle with this, and I want to be repentant if I wronged in any way so that is currently where I am, wondering should I not have raised my voice? How should I have handled it differently? Did I not honor my father? He continues to text me saying things like he has been too good a father to be treated this way, which still seems so manipulative and unhealthy. That is not what this is about. I never questioned his goodness as a father despite the many times he has lost control of his emotions with me, but yet he claims I am the problem, I am the one who turns to emotion and attacking.

Just struggling with this. I ended up emailing him a long email laying out his behavior and the pattern that has come up for years. The difference is, now I am a man who has the liberty of asserting myself without fear of how he will react, being grounded, treated with coldness, living with tension in the house, etc. And I think he hates that. I don’t know. Each of my siblings have also experienced this. And there are times where he talks down to my sweet mother, and I can see the hurt on her face (fortunately they love each other). There are former employees of his (he’s a CEO) who have left reviews that indicate that same concerns I have had regarding my dad for years. Calling him a bully, his way or the highway, controlling, etc. I would hate to use that against my dad, but this is a pattern.

The question is, what do you all think about this? And how do I move forward? What is my place in all this? I don’t want to feel like I have to fix him, but I also want him to know how unhealthy this kind of thing is now that I have the chance. He just retired and he is only getting older. 

Please, any thoughts would help? Have any of you experienced this? Do I sound like I need to humble myself?",surekooks,2020-03-29 16:39:31,10,2744,20.31,53.5,54.77,10.56,18.67,15.93,92.64,62.1,25.11,18,10.9,0.58,0.95,5.39,0.18,7.11,3.94,12.94,9.29,4.85,8.2,2,18.77,3.32,1.9,1.93,0.44,1.49,5.94,2.22,3.43,0.44,1.46,0.18,15.74,2.81,0,1.53,6.6,12.5,2.77,2.33,1.93,2.73,1.17,3.5,3.21,0.51,2,0.51,0.98,0.18,0.44,0,0.15,7.62,2.88,1.13,2.59,0.84,0.69,7.36,9.4,0.84,11.88,1.64,5.76,4.74,0.55,0.29,0.26,0.11,0.07,0.07,0.04,0,0.04,0,0,0,13.78,5.17,4.77,0,0,0.4,0.04,0.22,1.57,0.84,0.66,0.11
frgn1t,"My father is consumed by Alcohol, opioids, and narcissism. He has lost his health, soul, and mind. Please help.🤲","         My father is a narcissist and he always feels the need to bully someone to feel less shame and regret that he carries so often.I have no idea if it was because of his withdrawal from the prescription drugs that he abuses or just another hangover from the bottle of vodka that his alcoholic diabetic ass takes every night. But he woke up this morning with an insane nerve that he couldn’t keep to himself. I feel like he’s either jealous of my recent successes or he hates to see me be happy. Anyway, he’s a narcissistic that’s being starved by someone that used to be a scape goat. 

          Telling me things like whenever i feel any-kind of emotion, he automatically tells me that I need to see a therapist again, as well as arrogantly asking me if everything in my brain is working fine. Even thought he’s the one who abbuses drugs and alcohol; can’t control his anger and makes all his employees sue him for being too much of an asshole for a boss.
 He feels so much shame for it that he gets the need to bully other people, his narcissistic behavior is getting worse and I feel like he’s running out of scapegoats. He see’s me eating chicken and he goes “that’s for naronn don’t eat it as im literally eating it. I go “ok Dad” then he literally starts screaming like a maniac, he savagely runs towards me and hits me with all of his weak ass strength, going “ohh thats why you hit jimmy with a bottle, (even though im the one that was hit) you’re very smart, you know exactly what your doing”, as im literally asking him “what am I doing? I don’t understand why you’re acting this way?”

      Starts yelling some more, making everybody scared in the house saying he wants me to hit him, hit him, hit him because he instantly regrets the way he reacted so badd. My mom comes down stairs and goes “son stay away from that psycho, go to your room. Please go to your room”. I’m telling the security guard what happened because I’m still in shock about the situation. Even the maid that’s always going against me says that I'm right in this situation, And that my father had no reason to act like such a maniac.

         He needs a therapist and some more prescriptions in my opinion. He’s so high off his drugs that he can’t even act straight anymore. All the substances he’s abused are finally getting their take on him. I know he’s in there, but the person he’s pretending to be is consuming his soul from the inside. Someone please help. Some advice would help me handle this narcissistic inferno for a father.",ghosterpapss,2020-03-29 17:24:16,3,483,26.82,73.96,4.75,3.71,20.12,16.15,92.75,56.94,24.84,17.18,6.63,0,1.45,8.9,0.21,7.66,5.38,11.8,8.9,4.97,6.63,1.45,21.53,3.73,3.11,1.45,0.41,3.11,7.04,2.28,4.55,0.62,2.07,0.62,16.15,1.45,0,0.41,10.14,13.04,2.69,2.28,2.28,2.9,1.86,2.48,2.48,0.41,0.83,1.24,5.18,1.04,3.11,0,1.66,5.59,0.62,0.62,3.31,1.24,0.62,1.45,15.11,0.83,10.35,2.69,4.76,3.11,0.83,1.04,0.83,0,0.41,0,1.45,0.62,0,0.21,0.41,0.21,16.36,4.76,3.93,0,0.21,0.41,0,0.21,1.86,4.55,0.41,0
frgzhh,I think I was a victim of CSA. Thoughts?,"Hi. This is a terrifying post to make but I feel that it needs to be done. This is a throwaway, obviously, that I made today after lurking on my other account. 

TW: brief suicide mention among the obvious 

 This is marked NSFW because I will go into detail about why I think this was CSA. This has been weighing on me for a while now and I want to know if you guys have similar experiences or what your opinion is. I intend on returning to therapy to talk about this as soon as regular appointments open back up. 

 I am now in my late teens. I am female if this matters. My childhood was sort of odd and thus will the timeline here. So here is some background: I am/was a military kid. It was my father who served but he has since retired this year. Until now, that way of life was all I knew. So, we’ve lived in several different locations as a result. 

 We’ll begin with my earliest memories. This is one that hit me like a truck last night and caused a strong emotional response: pain in my genital area. Frequently. This was around preschool maybe a little before. My mother would have to apply some sort of cream. I don’t know what it was but I know that it did make it better for the moment. She probably wouldn’t remember this, I’ve asked about other unrelated things and she’s clueless about most of them. So around this time I started preschool. I had the most horrific separation anxiety, in particular, when it came to my mother. When she would drop me off at school I was sent into a panic and would cry non stop. This went on until third grade where I was still anxious but at least stopped crying about it. After preschool through about first grade I don’t really remember anything. 
 And so we come to second grade. Here’s where things get a little wild so do be warned. I knew way way way too much about sex, the body, etc. I would google it constantly, it was an obsession. I had a large doll. I would act it out on it. I would dream about it and make my dolls in such positions. As an older teen now, I know that these things I was doing were ACCURATE. Lots of little kids learn fast, but in this much detail? I don’t remember actually feeling anything though. It was compulsive. I don’t know how long this occurred but I think I finally chilled on that around fourth grade. 
 
Grade four is a nightmare. I don’t remember specifics but my mental state went out the window further than it already had been. I began therapy and was started on Zoloft not even halfway through the year. I had my first suicidal ideations that year although I didn’t know what I would do. 
 
 Grade five was uneventful. I think. But 6 and 7 were awful. My suicidal tendencies grew stronger and I was now able to act on them. I was in a deep pit of depression. I tried every medication they legally could have given me and none worked. I hated my body so much that I convinced myself that I was a boy and tried to live that way up until mid 8th grade. Things were still hard and I was still back and fourth but ultimately decided I was indeed female. 

 9th, 10th, and 11th grade have been uneventful if you ignore my current disability status (genetics) and mental health has been largely connected to that and the physical pain. However, I have an Intense fear of people, especially men who are larger than me. Which isn’t uncommon so it’s a struggle. A friend admitted to having a crush on me and I about threw up at the idea of even an emotionally intimate relationship, let alone any sort of touching, even hand holding. Imagining my true self in a relationship sends me into a panic. In the world I have in my head (maladaptive daydreaming I suppose, it’s been the same ideas since literally kindergarten. I could write a never ending film franchise.), my imagined relationships are less than ideal irl. The partner is abusive and I recognize it but I almost like the idea. It’s sickening. 

 With that being said, I’ve moved a lot. Since 6th grade I’ve lived part time at my current location which I permanently reside. I have trouble interacting with my male family members regardless of who they are. But there’s nothing... special? About my feelings toward any of them. I’ve had dreams of one in particular being abusive but at the early times where this could’ve occurred we lived so far away that it would’ve been in short bursts. In person I don’t feel much differently. I absolutely feel like something happened but I can’t pinpoint The Who or what. Do I want to remember? Things are pretty okay now. Do I want to potentially ruin that for myself? 

 Idk, I could’ve just been a weird ass kid. Please tell me what you think. This is so long and it’s not even everything. I don’t know what to think but I feel like this is a possibility that could have explained events occurring what was potentially afterwards. Thank you.

frjaum,Need to talk to someone,"I just ended a relationship with an abusive woman. She was very controlling and manipulative, using things like gaslighting and self victimization to constantly elicit sympathy from me. One of those people where she's the victim in all of her stories and all of her exes were terrible people who she treated like gold. She constantly invalidated my emotions. It was never her fault that I was upset. She would exploit my mental illness to gaslight me in that way. She also never apologized for anything. On the rare occasion that she did, it was after a long argument and came with a ""but"". I'm bipolar and I don't have insurance so I'm not on medication. She would constantly trigger my illness and then make me feel bad about it. After we broke up, she was refusing to give some sentimental and important things back and I snapped. I told her that I'm not letting her steal from me. If she doesn't give my shit back, I'll break in and take it. Let me clarify, that was wrong. I shouldn't have said that. I do, however, feel that abuse victims can understand why I would. This was like my last stand. Not only are my possessions on the line, but so is what's left of my dignity. She then span the story into some sort of fear for her and her child's safety and is using that to destroy my music career. I'm getting messages from people saying that they won't book me over this. All I wanted was my shit back and now a bunch of people are calling ME abusive for getting mad about being stolen from.

frkxkr,My Family And I Have Been Abused For 7 Years Staying w/ My Grandparents,"For a while now, I have been trying to keep this secret while staying with them in fear of retaliation from a 74 year old Reverend who do practice what he teaches and has a ""rageful"", ""vile"", and ""toxic"" personaity type. The abuse we have suffered from them has been an ongoing thing, most all of our lives but they really had it in for us the day when we lost our home to a foreclosure back in 2012. All of our lives my Grandparents and their children (my aunt and uncles) has always hated us for no reason whatsoever. We have bend over backwards for these ungrateful, hateful, envious, Godless people. If it wasn't a threat, it is some sort of sly remark or some type of passive aggressive remark or they simply taking something out on us or blaming us for we didn't do, etc. What's interesting is that two years back I learned about sonething call ""Narcissist Personaity Disorder"" which is something I never knew existed and the crazy thing is that ""these people hit every single one of the symptom of that disorder"". They are just ""Pure Evil"". Soulless, double-minded, manipulative people who are just miserable and wants to destroy us for some ""weird"" ""unknown"" reason. Something that happened on my mother's birthday this year is what made me really want to just put this ""person"", and these ""people"" on blast over the internet. Yet I feel I can't because the Mr. Revy Rev (is who I will call my grandfather) will raise HELL in the house if he finds out I or one of us (my mother or two younger brothers) talk about what he has done and said to us outside of his house because he would be ""Humiliated"" behind what he has done and top of the fact is that their are a lot of people who like or love us yet has been trying to convert people to hate us and if people believe him over us (if they found out what happened in his house) they were never down with us to begin with so I'm cool with that. I'm sorry if I can't go into details about it all right now, but it would be a ""long"" and ""aurdous"" post that would literally have me needing to pull up all my audio diaries, video diaries, and notes I have written about life here currently in this house for years of my life (stayed with since I was 17 and just started senior year of High School and is currently 24 year old).

frlhqo,"I remembered more things, is it abuse?","I’ve started making a list of things I know have for sure happened. I’ve remembered some more of them, and I was wondering if it is abusive or just something parents do? For context, each walk home was at minimum half an hour, probably longer but I can’t remember. Also, I have chronic foot pain that makes walking pretty dang painful. I’ve undergone physical therapy and multiple surgeries to try and help it, but it still persists. Lastly, I was no older than 13 when this all happened. 
Ok, now on to the list:

Made me walk home in 100 degree weather
Made me walk home multiple times for arguing with my brother
Refused to pick me up from downtown because she simply didn’t want to, had to take a public bus alone at 10 pm
Called me useless
Told me there was something wrong with me
Left for school with my brother but not me, leaving me behind deliberately, making me late
Told me I can’t criticize her when she does everything for me/bends over backwards for me
Tells me I cry for attention

fro76f,My life was mess up as a child.,"Tw:Sexual Abuse

I also have storys of physical and mental abuse but those are for another day

I first realized it was bad when I was 14 and I made my mother a mother's day card and covered it with drawings and stuff. She looked happy and she came over and hugged me. When she hugged me I realized I didnt know how to hug people. I realised hoe much I avoided physical contact. And how I never looked people in the eyes when talking and how this would get me in trouble.

So I went to a private therapist and started talking about it. 

Then when I talked we found out from ages 6-10 I was sexually abused by my cousin. I didnt realized what was going on- he just told me it was out little secret- now that fucked me up big time. I was blocking this out of my memory. 
And after talking to my therapist more I am now diagnosed with clinical depression and mild PTSD. 

Moral of the story: if you think something is odd. Talk to someone about it. It doesnt have to be a therapist.  It could be anyone",Matt_The_Twatt,2020-03-30 03:18:31,2,206,11.36,34.88,89.84,3.13,13.73,13.59,94.17,61.17,23.3,15.05,12.14,0.49,0.49,1.94,0,8.25,2.91,12.62,9.22,7.28,11.65,1.94,19.42,4.37,1.46,3.88,1.94,1.46,6.31,1.94,4.37,0.49,1.94,0.49,12.14,1.46,0.49,2.43,0.49,11.65,4.37,1.94,1.94,1.94,0.49,1.94,1.46,1.46,0,0,5.83,0.49,3.88,1.46,0,7.28,2.43,0.49,2.43,0.49,1.46,10.68,6.8,0.97,14.08,1.46,5.34,7.28,0,0,0,0,0.49,0,0.97,0.97,0,0,0,0,9.71,6.8,0,0.97,0,0,0,1.46,0,0.49,0,0

frsdwe,unhealthy way of attempting to access traumatic memories. what do i do?,"a few months ago, a friend of mine and i had a conversation about his suspection of having been sexually assaulted, he had gathered that he thinks his brain put up a barrier over his trauma and wont allow him to like access those traumatic memories. im sorry i cant explain it better. he gets flashbacks, and sometimes it freaks him the fuck out, he also often doubts that its even real. but it must be if he has flashbacks right? he told me that hes going to try access those memories so he can heal. i was overly supportive until he revealed what hes going to do.

without going into much detail he basically said he is going to try physically trigger himself to make himself remember. i know he has physical triggers which set him off, i know what they are and i dont know if hes going to try any of those but im scared honestly. i dont want him to hurt himself or make his ptsd i assume it is even worse. 

and yes i have suggested therapy multiple times but he told me that he cant even explain his flashbacks out loud without crying and feeling pain. 

i dont know if this is the wrong subreddit to put this on but maybe someone who knows how to handle these types of things can help?

please also, dont suggest therapy. thats not the advice im looking for. trust me when i say i have tried to convince him to go to therapy. every time it fails. i just need to know if this is safe, whcih i doubt it is and how i can help my friend.

fru98s,Am I Overreacting?,"I'm probably on the wrong subreddit but yesterday afternoon I was lying in bed and my brother apparently thought it would be funny to try to push me off. Since I had a really bad stomach ache and didn't want to get out of the position that was finally helping me relieve the pain, I put up some resistance. Then my brother proceeded to touch me and try to push me from ""down there.'' I asked him to stop but he didn't and then I just froze. This isn't the first time that he's touched me ''down there'' but there is always a layer of clothes between his hand and my ''down there'' area. Even so, I get really uncomfortable and always ask him to stop, but he doesn't seem to know the meaning of that word. I'm probably overreacting, but was this abuse? To provide some context, my brother is also a few years younger than me (he is currently twelve) and very sheltered. I'm pretty sure that my mom hasn't even given him anything resembling ''the talk'' yet since he is slightly developmentally delayed so he probably didn't know any better.

Anyways I'm so confused. Was this abuse or am I overreacting? I really don't want to get my brother into trouble, especially since he probably didn't know any better, but I don't want this to happen again.

I’m sorry for all the grammar issues in this post, I’m high, dunk and on bezos. To make a long story short, when I was a teenager, I travelled abroad for the first time in my life and met a person I thought I could trust. I extended my stay, because I felt understood for the first time in my life, having had a complicated childhood involving several types of mental health disorders in my immediate family, along with alcoholism and the death of my father. I wanted to run away from all that, and ended up trapped. Basically, I was beaten and confined to a bedroom for 2 months, because my ex was convinced I was cheating on him. 
My laptop was thrown away, my phone cracked, and I was unable to contact my family or call for help, unless I had explicit permission. Of course, going dark led to my mom writing me dozens of emails about how awful a person I am, and all my relatives ended up speculating about what I was up to. In truth, I was trying to protect my family at home from a psychopath who knew where I lived, and who would often describe, in detail, how my family would be slaughtered, along with myself. I was beaten interrogation style for hours at a time. I have never been in worse pain in my life. And I wasn’t allowed to take Advil. I ended up running away after a night of intense beating, when I noticed the booby traps on the door were forgotten. I ran out without anything, even shoes on my feet, in a foreign country. Saddest part was, that we had a roommate who knew what was going on, who heard my screams, and still did jack shit to help. 

I was just trying to protect my family, and coming home to blame and accusations has led me to this stage. I have tried all the meds out there, trust me, but the nightmares and constant flashbacks just wont go away. I also did EDMR. Nothing works. I am done. This is unbearable, and I have no reason to keep on going, every minute of my life is hell. I see no solution to this issue, besides ending it, and I want to reunite with my dad. 

To whomever cared enough to read this far, thank you. It means more than words could describe. Please don’t let my pain become meaningless. Please learn from my mistakes, that have broken both me and my family for good. As the title states, if he (or she) hits you once, it’ll happen again. I can guarantee it. Feel free to IM me if you need support, or just someone to talk to.

frzl6h,Dealing with PTSD Flair-ups,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting on a platform about this, but the last few days have been hard with the added stress of COVID-19 and stay-at-home order, and I don't want to start spiraling. I'm just looking for some advise and help.

Context: I was in an highly manipulative emotionally, verbally, and sexually abusive relationship for 3 years, starting my junior year of high school and ending shortly before my sophomore year of college. Thankfully, I was able to get a lot of help coming out of the relationship from my family, counselors, and now my wonderful husband. I still suffer from some symptoms of C-PTSD, including panic attacks, nightmares, and flashbacks. It didn't help that I continued to see my abuser almost everyday after the breakup as we attended the same university until this past December. I have grown and healed a lot since then, but I haven't been able to go to counseling recently due to my counselor moving away and my busy schedule. My husband is wonderful and supportive, but there is a lot he doesn't understand either or just doesn't know how to fix (he knows he can't fix all of it, don't worry). 

Problem: over the past few weeks, I have had recurring nightmares and more panic attacks/flashbacks than I have had for a long time. I think its due to the raised stress levels of this whole COVID-19 situation and having too much time to sit inside my own head as I work from home (I'm an introvert so I tend to process everything internally). I'm just having a hard time dealing with everything and would like some advise/help with how to deal with this flair-up and keep myself from spiraling during this time. Anything would help. 

Thank you,

fs6qb2,Advise on sexual assault/rape,"Hi everyone,

I have been raped and sexually assaulted several times and recently been triggered from traumatic events I thought I was healed from. Recently heard of a friend that was sexually assaulted by someone and a bunch of girls came out about it and are trying to report him. This just made me feel crap because I never reported anything of mine. I will give examples in chronological order 

The first time I was raped was with my first boyfriend. He did a lot of things that I never ever consented to. The thing he did the most was refuse to wear a condom and it made me so anxious that I might get pregnant.

The second time was some random guy at a dorm room. I was waiting for his roommate, who was my friend, to get back from class. We decided to get food together and watch stuff but I think he thought it was a date? And then he started kissing me aggressively and got on top of me and started shoving his hand down my pants and I just remembered the things he said to me ""are you wet enough for me"", ""you like that don't you?"" And it all made me so uncomfortable. His kissing and fingering me was hurting me but no matter what my body was frozen. The only reason things didn't go further was my phone went off and my friend told me he was returning to the room soon if we wanted to hang out.... I felt saved by that message...I showed the message to the guy and said I got to go. I left and went straight to my room and cried. I remember looking in the mirror and seeing my lips were bruised and red and my neck a bit too. As I was going to bed he even texted me ""I love you""...I had just met him. I didn't know what to do or how to handle it. By the time I wanted to report I realized I didn't know his real name...and he was an international student.

Another time... I got another boyfriend...and things were going fine...but he read my journals without my permission and found out about the assaults described above. I never had someone violate my privacy before but he did. And then even after that things happened. First he hit my out of anger for playing around on his phone. Second I was sleeping and woke up cause I was in pain...only to realize that he had thrusted inside me...and he had a much bigger dick (and I'm also a really small girl so sex can hurt) and when I started acting frightened and confused he told me he thought I was awake...it was 4am... But he told me I was kissing him and stuff in my sleep (which idk if it's true or not but shouldn't someone realize that I would be asleep at 4am on a weekday?) So then instead of like talking about it he storms out the room crying...him...not me..I had to comfort someone who just started raping me in my sleep...like what?! 

And lastly... I was drunk studying abroad and going to a friend's party at a bar. I met this guy..and at this point I was very drunk...and he started talking and bought me a drink..and then we kissed a bit... then it went black..then I remembered being in a Subway...and he was kissing and touching me...and I was so frightened... Like how could no one say anything?...then I blacked out again...woke up d in the subway..it was supposed to be 20mins at most...it had been an hour...I remember him mentioning something about a hotel...but I was trying to get back to my friends apartment that I was staying at... Black out again...and I am in the apartment with my clothes off...black out again I see a man thrusting inside me and it's hurting a lot...black out again and I wake up the next morning snuggled in the couch with him...I have never ever done drunk hookups or anything like that...I was freaked out and worried and just hurting badly.. I was just so mad not a single person stopped the guy and said he was too drunk to take me home..why did they let him take me home? I never met him before plus I was an international student...

So the thing I want to know...is I can't really report these...but how do I get rid of the guilt of what happened? Who do I talk to? And how do I tell my boyfriend now (who is super amazing btw) about everything? Should I even tell him? I've been super upset this last week but I told him I didn't think I could tell him...I've never really told anyone these things before...so I'm just trying to get some help.",cyrabear,2020-03-30 21:55:24,4,852,14.44,32.37,81.1,6.31,20.78,13.38,96.36,64.44,24.3,17.25,12.09,0.35,0.47,4.23,0.12,7.04,4.93,11.85,9.62,6.57,9.74,2.35,21.13,3.29,1.88,1.76,0.82,1.76,5.52,1.88,3.64,0.94,1.53,0.7,12.56,0.12,1.53,0.23,5.16,11.74,2.35,1.41,1.17,3.17,1.41,3.17,3.4,1.17,0.82,1.41,3.99,1.64,0.47,1.29,0.82,7.75,3.29,1.06,2.11,1.41,0.12,11.85,6.1,1.53,14.08,1.41,6.69,6.22,1.29,1.06,1.41,0.12,0,0,0.59,0.35,0.23,0,0,0.12,21.95,17.02,0.47,0,0,1.17,0.12,0,0.7,1.64,0.7,0.12
fs724u,Was I Abused?,"CW: possible abuse? suicide mention

Hi. I have a question; have I been abused. 

I don’t know where to start, or how to ask this question appropriately, so instead I’ll give a brief overview of what my father has done to me and see if that qualifies as abuse.

First and foremost, I have a separate post that may pertain to this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/ek35eg/dad\_might\_have\_used\_a\_camera\_to\_monitor\_me\_up\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI/comments/ek35eg/dad_might_have_used_a_camera_to_monitor_me_up_to/)

it is about how my father most likely used a camera to spy on me during nearly my entire life.

My father is well known to be an irrational man. It’s why my mom left him and why I avoid seeing him unless it is something like his birthday and I feel too bad not to visit. My father does not take being incorrect well (so much so that once he believes his idea of reality is right, he will never change his mind). If he disagrees with you on something he will never concede his point and always needs to win the argument. If the argument ends without him being admitted to being right then he refuses to let go of the topic until he is agreed upon to be correct. This obviously lead to a rocky and brief marriage and a tumultuous relationship with me, his only child.

An early but less severe example is when he claimed the cold would give me well… the cold and I, with my elementary school level science education, corrected him. He never accepted this, in fact it is still something I joke about even in his own company because it does not have as many… negative experiences attached to it.

When it comes to the aforementioned more serious disagreements we’ve had, there’s my hair. I know, such an innocuous little thing, should this really be that serious? Oh it is. Around the middle of my time in middle school, I got my previously veery long hair cut off into a pixie cut (which, by the way, looked way better than my long hair). My father was extremely upset about this as he had projected this image of a perfect feminine young lady onto me since birth. Ever since, he has constantly harassed me about growing my hair out again, how it would be *so pretty* if it was long. Whenever my hair gets a bit longer and I’m ready for a new cut, he gets an eager look in his eyes and suggests I don’t cut it. Honestly, typing this out makes it feel so petty and like something that shouldn’t have hurt me but oh god it did. Whenever someone comments on my hair even in a slightly positive or neutral way I lash out in irrational anger and become defensive. When I get my hair cut I flinch at the hairdresser asking if I *really want it that short* or comment that it looks *cute*. When I brought up how his comments about my hair made me feel he said it was silly that I thought of it that way.

The hair thing stings a bit more than normal because I am trans (non-binary specifically) and I am overly sensitive to comments about me being feminine. I haven’t told my father that I am non-binary because I know there would be no point and it would only serve to hurt me as his response would be… horrible. I asked him once about trans people and he said that they were “messed up in the head”. He has weaponized the word “lady” to refer to how he wants me to be and it is only made worse by my trans-ness.

I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and some sprinkles of trauma mixed in. My father has resisted getting me help for any of these issues despite how they previously had severely handicapped my ability to function as a person in society. Seriously, I was getting panic attacks about losing a binder in a stairwell. I eventually did get therapy, but not without him dragging his feet the whole way. He was even more resistant to the idea of me getting medication (something my therapist wanted me to get because I was getting thoughts of suicidal ideation). I eventually got both, but I was denied for over a decade because of his stick in the mud attitude. One day, I straight up told him I had once experienced suicidal ideation and he just nodded, smiled, and ignored me. I explained to him my anxiety and he gave me a very kindly worded version of “get over it”. When I had anxiety about anything and it prevented me from doing things he wanted me to do, he FORCED me into it which only negatively reinforced the things I was anxious about (something I am still working on fixing at age 18).

Also I think… I think he gaslit me and my mom. The only reason it didn’t fuck with me and just made me angry and frustrated was because whenever he did it, I would check up with my mom about it and was quickly reassured that he was full of shit. An example of the gaslighting was whenever I told him one of the myriad things that he did that upset me, and he simply said that he had never done such a thing.

He also constantly treats me like a child. He talks in the third person “Daddy’s going to \_\_\_” (creepy as hell, I know). He basically mansplains everything to me, and when I feel one coming on I try to stop him but he adamantly continues to explain something that I understand better than him. Whenever I talk to him, I’m made to feel as if my emotions are silly and whenever I display them (something I’m prone to do as I am very outward in my expression of emotions in arguments) I am dismissed for having them, as if expressing how I felt made my whole argument invalid. If I was angry (which I often am) he would unnervingly calmly point it out and let off an air of “this means you’re being silly and I’m right”.

Now for some less… sfw topics.

If I ever farted when I was little my dad forced me to go to the bathroom and wouldn’t let me return to what I was doing until I had gone. When I was little and learning how my body worked, I would masturbate. At the time I was doing this I also had an issue of still having to wear pull-ups to bed as I would wet the bed otherwise. At my mom’s house I was given pull-ups and was perfectly happy, but at my father’s he forced me to go to bed without a pull-up (which resulted in me wetting the bed every night, big surprise). When this happened, he sometimes would tell me that I had peed in bed intentionally, and if he caught me masturbating he would tell me that *that* was why I was wetting the bed. Okay that’s all for the less sfw stuff.

This is… a sliver of what I’ve gone through. I dunno, a logical part of me screams at me, saying this is obviously abuse but there’s also another part of me that invalidates my first instincts on these sorts of things.",Snom-support-group,2020-03-30 22:20:36,0,1273,19.18,31.6,61.18,4.01,23.15,15.48,91.44,61.59,23.1,16.1,11,0.08,0.16,4.56,0.31,6.99,4.48,12.96,10.13,7.38,8.41,1.57,17.99,4.56,2.28,2.67,0.79,1.81,6.52,2.04,4.24,0.94,1.57,0.31,10.92,1.34,0,0.63,5.58,13.59,2.44,2.91,2.28,3.22,1.65,3.14,2.2,0.79,0.39,0.86,1.18,0.47,0.31,0.24,0.16,4.87,0.47,0.94,2.04,1.57,0.47,6.21,8.17,0.94,12.96,1.57,6.36,5.18,0.94,0.47,0.63,0,0.16,0.24,1.26,0.24,0.55,0.08,0.39,0.08,17.75,4.87,3.22,0.16,0.08,0.24,0,0.47,0.79,1.65,1.57,4.71
fs7440,Please help!!! Need advice!!!,"I am a 17 year old male, and I want to start off with a disclaimer by saying I am very lucky to never have been physically abused.  However, my father has emotionally hurt me, threatened me, and when he’s really angry, he hits the dogs and I’m afraid things are getting worse.  He has a hard time controlling his emotions, and he snaps a lot at the smallest things.  

Once I didn’t have any blue jeans (I’d left my only pair at my moms house), and he started cussing out my mother (they are divorced) saying she steals all the stuff he has, and that she quit her job during the court case (which is true) when I was around 9, and made me cry for a solid ten minutes because I didn’t know this stuff.  One time, me and my sister forgot to put our plates in the dishwasher and he made her cry in a car ride by yelling at us, and I got dropped off to school first.  Worst thing is, he comforted her, saying it’s ok for me to yell at you, it’s alright.  I didn’t want to leave her but I had to.  He hates it when I speak Spanish, because it’s like our mom, and he hates it when we show too much emotion (calls us dramatic, like our mom), and he is completely unpredictable.  One minute, he’s happy talking about his day, the next, he’s hitting the dog on her head because she chewed up one of his plants (he gardens), and kicking the other one who did nothing in the face because he’s nearby.

2 nights ago, we got into a really bad fight, the printer wasn’t working, and he was pissed off, and the dog was chewing on a sore on his foot and he was angry that things were out of his control, so he tried hitting the dog, when he saw him chewing, not lightly to move his paw, but hard.  So I told him to stop, and he reluctantly agreed (I’m as big as him nowadays, it helps a lot).  Then, at night, the dog was licking a sore, and I guess he was still pissed about the printer, and he tried hitting him, (I don’t know if he did, I didn’t have a good view), and I told him to stop, and he refused, saying “it is ok, he needs to be disciplined” and stuff like that.  I’m really sensitive when it comes to dogs, I accidentally killed a different when I was 12, so I hate it when anyone does anything to a dog, so I was practically begging him and he finally agreed.  

Then he got weird and started laughing, and while we awkwardly prepped for dinner, he just kind of talked to himself, saying stuff like “it doesn’t hurt them, it wasn’t medieval torture” and more weird stuff.  Then he started talking about how his dad was worse, which is something he does a lot, talk about how others have it worse than I do and I should be grateful.  Then he started getting scary, saying “my dad chased me around a car, maybe I should start chasing you around a car to see how you like it”, and I got scared.  This was the first time he’d ever physically threatened me, so I froze and panicked, and said the only thing I could think of, “that’s why I keep two knives in my pocket.”  

I really did have knives in my pocket, I was bored during Corona and was trying to act tough by carrying them, and when I was really angry and not in my right mind I’d imagine having them to threaten dad like some badass hero.  He kind of just froze, and said “you wouldn’t stick me, would you?”  Almost like he was hurt.  I feel so bad, am I in the wrong, should I have threatened him, and things have been real awkward and quite between us since then.  We don’t really look at each other.  

I want to make up with him, but I don’t know how, I want him to stop hitting the dogs, but he isn’t even trying.  I don’t want to have a falling out with my dad, I want him to still be my dad, but right now, I don’t know what to do.  I’m scared the next time he gets angry, I’m gonna do something I regret because I don’t want him to hurt anyone.

fs8ui8,Venting,"My father is an abusive, lying, manipulative piece of shit who does nothing but terrorize my mom and siblings. I'm away at university with no way to actually help, even more so with all the lockdowns. He tells the nastiest, worst lies in order to make himself look good and my mom and me look bad, when he does nothing in the interest of any of us. He even went and had an outside child and still expects us to respect him. Because no one does, he has cut me off, physically abuses my mom and bullies the kids to feel in control.

fsaat8,Feel horrible. Should I make a plan?,"Hi
I'm sorry I'm posting from a throwaway but I need privacy.
Today I feel like I lost it. It was just too much. I've being struggling with my mental disorders for a long time, today I was so distraught.
I have thoughts and obsession that are important but cause me to become suicidally depressed.
As an adult I am still living with my parents, I've got no job (on and off with job agencies), uni has been similar.
Then these things happen.
It happens randomly, sometimes three times a week, sometimes once a fortnight, you never know.
All my energy is put into my obsessions and problems.

My parents stormed into my room angry that I had used the spare bedroom and created a mess. I get it- my room and the spare bedroom is a mess. I can only say it's related to a lot of my phobias and it's a work in progress.
There was a lot of verbal and psychological abuse from both parents. A lifetime of it..and I snapped. I stood up for myself, told my dad to treat me like a daughter for once in his life.

I told my mum about my suicide attempts and struggle to get through the mental health system. She couldn't care less.
What she did have the energy for though was to go into room and verbally harass me repeatedly, while im on the phone with a counsellor.

All I wanted tonight was to nurse my cold and watch a 20 min episode of an anime. I haven't even been able to even finish the episode.
My dad mocked my cold. Last night I had to rescue the neighbour's cat from the tree outside my room, risking bites and scratches coz he can get aggressive. Anyway I very reluctantly enlisted by parents' help bc I couldn't help the cat on my own. You're perfectly fine, he says, otherwise you wouldn't have rescued the cat last night.
I am so done.
Iam emotionally broken. My mental illnesses aren't my worst enemy. *They* are.

What kind of sick psychos care more about orderliness and housekeeping than a person's life?
I would have left eons ago, but I'm not financially independent and my thoughts keep me here. ( Can get real delusional in there)

Sorry for this long post, but I just need some solidarity. Whenever these events happen I feel so devastated. Should I just say **** it and make a solid plan to get out once lockdown stops?
I really have felt hopeless tonight and I don't want to feel this way one more time.",throwaway24665,2020-03-31 03:05:01,1,441,36.31,18.83,79.07,1,12.25,17.23,91.16,54.42,18.37,14.51,12.47,0,0.68,1.13,0.23,3.85,6.35,10.66,10.43,4.99,7.03,2.04,18.59,4.54,2.04,0.68,1.36,2.27,7.94,2.04,5.9,2.04,1.36,1.36,7.48,1.81,0.23,0.91,1.13,11.56,2.27,1.81,2.49,1.59,0.91,2.49,2.95,0.23,0.91,1.81,1.81,0,1.81,0,0,7.03,1.59,1.81,1.59,1.59,1.13,5.22,12.93,1.13,12.24,0.45,5.22,6.35,1.59,0,1.59,0.23,0,0.45,0.68,0,0.45,0,0,0.23,17.91,7.94,2.95,0,0,0.68,0,0.23,0,3.85,0.91,1.36
fsbtrl,What can I do to help myself during a COVID lockdown with my toxic family?,"I grew up in a pretty unstable environment. A lot of hitting, yelling, screaming, verbal abuse, etc. Thankfully the violence and hitting from everyone has gradually stopped, but the rest remained. They still hurl abuse and can be very loud, boisterous, and generally annoying to each other. There is no privacy in the house, nowhere to hide, nothing which will drain out their noise. 

It is imminent my country will go into lockdown, and I have nowhere to go or anyone to help me. I don’t have the funds to move out quickly or rent a place so I have no choice but to stay home with my family. I’m afraid that I am going to become suicidal and/or hurt myself from being around them and becoming drained mentally. Last week I spent 3 days at home as my hours were cut and I became extremely emotionally exhausted. Of course I’m not able to go out to do anything like I used to and my gym has closed. 

When I think about being stuck at home and not being allowed out anywhere, I can’t think about anything but killing myself. I have tried to brainstorm some ideas to keep me distracted and get through day by day, but of course none of them are going to do enough to help me completely avoid them. I feel like there has to be more to it than this and I’m not thinking enough about what I can do while I’m at home. It also doesn’t help that I relapsed in self harm a month ago after almost a year clean.

fskh4j,Am I being abused?,"I often feel like my girlfriend can be abusive at times but I also think I'm crazy. I was hoping I could get some insight because I genuinely cant figure out whether or not I deserve to be treated the way she treats me. 

First of all shes disabled which means I do all of the housework. This is fine with me, but it leaves me stressed out having to clean up after 2 people and our pets by myself.  So any way today she entered the bedroom and commented on the fact that it was dirty and there was a stain on the carpet that was from hot sauce I spilled. I genuinely want an answer so I'm trying to recall as best I can, Im not trying to twist any of this to demonize her.

I said I would steam-clean the carpet soon.

She said ""We wouldn't have to steam clean if you would just pay attention.""

I said ""Yes I understand the mistake I made that lead to me spilling sauce on the rug and I'm trying to be more careful."" 

She said ""You say you're trying, but if you were really trying you wouldn't do shit like this. Do you know why this room is so dirty? Its because you dont pay attention."" 

I was feeling upset and I said, ""I think it also has to do with the fact that I spend most of the day cleaning up after 2 people and our pets."" 

And she said ""No, that's just an excuse you're using to take responsibility off of yourself."" 

I said, ""You know, talking to some of my friends lately has made me realize that discussions like this one go much more smoothly when things are phrased more gently, so I would appreciate if you could continue to point out your grievances with me in a more gentle way."" 

She said, ""This is why I can't talk to you about my feelings. You always make it about you and your feelings before you even address my feelings."" 

I said, ""That's fair, but in couples therapy you said that negative emotional responses from me such as crying make you feel like you're being punished/invalidated for expressing your feelings. So I thought it would be productive/appropriate to address that first since it causes problems for you."" 

She said, ""My mistake was trying to talk about my feelings. Youre not even listening, this was a waste of time. You're acting like Im being mean but Im not, what I'm saying is true and its not my fault you're just too sensitive."" 

Now all of that was a summary. At one point she went down a laundry list of behaviors of mine she didnt like, using phrases like ""if you would just put in some effort"" ""if you would just try a little bit"" ""if you could be bothered to even think about it"" etc and I was just sitting in bed in tears. She was irritated by the crying with a very 'here we go again' attitude. 

I said ""I want you to talk about your feelings, and I want to address your concerns. But it would be much easier for me to listen if I didn't have to transcend having my PTSD triggered by your phrasing,"" 

Was met with ""You always have to turn it  around on me and make it about my phrasing, you always take responsibility away from yourself. I'm not being mean, and I don't care about your feelings.""

Am I the one out of line here? I feel like Im going crazy.

fskyl5,Rant About A Company,"TL;DR extremely uncomfortable and toxic working environment due to extremely RUDE and arrogant employers who don't communicate with employees, they only state their demands but never listen. They also comment inappropriate things about their employees. Read: WORKPLACE ABUSE by the employers themselves.

Note: There is a number of fake 4-5 star reviews about this company (Advance Infosys Sdn Bhd) on other websites, they might have been posted by their close friends and/or relatives, or clients/other parties so that they get discounts for the provided services.

The employers are overly rude and arrogant, they have no respect for anybody whom they consider ""inferior"" which is practically everybody who doesn't match them in wealth and influence. They also never ever said sorry when they made mistakes (but never failed to accuse everyone else), which they do all the time due to their own lack of even the slightest effort to listen or try to understand the problems when told by employees). At work, if they're present, they often abuse employees (say derogatory things about them, often on problems that they themselves caused), and they're often the main cause of problems for everyone (they're this company's bottleneck). Outside of work, they always try to micromanage their employees, often harassing and monitoring them and pestering them in the group chats.

Furthermore, they are either quite incompetent or constantly distracted by something that's not related to work as they aren't even able to setup their software properly, calculate properly or fill out forms properly, often doing their work with lots of mistakes. Then they would scream and insult employees whenever their own mistakes impacted them.

There are two bosses, CK Ooi, and Lock WC.

The older one is extremely absent-minded, often can't remember the things he said and the things and the mistakes he did, yet he often, without any hesitation, accuses others of those mistakes he made himself. It is impossible to talk to him because he doesn't communicate, he only screams or states sternly about his demands like a child even though he's in his 60s. 

The younger one is always very unreasonable and can't stick to his words, so anything he says can't be taken seriously. One moment he says A, then right after he changes his mind. Despite this, he is extremely quick to accuse employees for not being able to cope with his indecisiveness.

Adding to all this, is that during the movement control order (MCO) to prevent or slow down the spread of COVID-19, both of them are still pestering so many of their employees to work on-site despite the dangers. AFAIK, a few of their employees ACTUALLY WENT TO WORK at the office during the MCO! 

It would seem that they do not care about the lives of their employees at all.

Complaints about them and even police reports have been lodged to the authorities. Despite all this, they're still unrepentant and show no signs of remorse.",AdvanceInfosysOoiLoc,2020-03-31 13:46:58,0,500,37.52,81.05,7.13,1,22.73,22.8,88.2,57.6,17,10.8,0,0,0,3.6,7.2,6.2,5,13.8,7,9.4,7.6,3.2,12,2.6,1.2,1.6,1.4,2.4,7.4,0.8,6.4,0.6,1.6,0.8,17.6,0.2,0.2,0,3.6,18.2,1.2,1.8,2.6,5.6,3.4,5.6,2,0.2,1.8,0,0.6,0,0.6,0,0,11.8,1.4,3.2,5.8,0.8,1.6,2.6,10.4,0.6,11.6,1,3.8,6.8,6.6,0.4,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,4,5.6,0.4,0.2,0,0.2,0.8,0.4,2.8,2.2,0.4

fsr6ns,Are my experiences really abuse?,"This is mostly gonna be about two things in chronological order with what I remember.

In September 2017 I was just starting sixth grade. On the *second day* of sixth grade a girl I had never met asked for my phone number, I really didn't think much of it and gave it to her without even knowing her name , putting her name in as just ""Purple hair girl""...

Worst decision of my life.

This was the beginning of sixth grade remember? Meaning we were both 11. We face timed quite and I remember the conversation almost immediately turned sexual. A specific bit of dialogue I remember is her saying ""Have you ever had sex"" and, being eleven I said no and she said ""Oh, I guess that's not normal for an 11 year old is it"" and that was probably just in the first week, it only gets worse from there.

She offered to give me alcohol and sex toys multiple times throughout our relationship which I denied.  Eventually she told me we *were* going to the movies to see IT when it came out and she told me we were gonna have sex in the movie theater bathroom. I tried to get out of it, telling her the movie was scary and stuff like that but she wouldn't let up so I caved in. Luckily though we got into a fight and broke up before that ever happened. Although later that same year I lost my virginity to a different girl.

She also sent me nudes without my permission which I reported to my school counselor to which he said ""Just delete it or you'll be charged with owning child pornography""

(Can we all just collectively say FUCK SCHOOL COUNSELORS!!! I've never heard of them being helpful.)

She was also extremely manipulative. She would demean herself to keep control of me, she was transphobic to me and she did everything she could to keep her power over me. I wanted to leave, I really did but I knew that wasn't an option. 

It was so bad that long after we broke up I had terrible thoughts of harming myself and ended up attempting suicide.

On to my mom

I've only noticed this recently, but I think it's gone on longer than that. My mom yells at me and my sister. She said she's legitimately thought about burning our house down. She just guilt trips us all the time. I can't remember a lot of it even though it was the other night and the other week.

fsrflb,It all started with a one night stand..,"On mobile, please forgive 
Don't share/copy/paste or use my postings. Thanks 

Ok. So, pretty sure that caught your curiosity. Here's the rest of the story. 

I'm 39(F) who hit a sleep around phase about 18 months ago. One night stands, fwb, things as that. Used protection. Very safe about my slutty side lol 

Well, the condom broke one time. Oops. Took a morning after. Ghosted him. Life moves on...

I wouldn't be here, if life moved on. I found out I was pregnant a few weeks later. Was SHOCKED.  This dude had super sperm! I didn't tell him until I was past the abortion time, because I wanted this baby. 

He did too. So bad. He begged me to move closer (he owns a local store that's been here 20 years). No biggie, I'm from here. My family helped settle this area. Move back home.  Hell yeah! 

A week after I move into my place, (all mine) his WIFE shows up knocking on my door. By this time I'm 24 weeks obviously pregnant. She is as shocked as I was to learn they'd been married 24 years. She divorced him, kicked him out and wished me luck. I was his 5th or 6th affair. 

He moved in with his brother, but stayed with me a lot. It was nice, the first 2 months. I blew off him demanding I sever ties with my male friends. Only talk to the males I HAD to, on speaker. He went through my phone several times a day. I blew it off. 

Then, he started accusing me of cheating. Nope. Not my style. I went to work, home, store and my sister's once a week. Well, he told me I couldn't go anymore. Then slashed my tires. She came and picked me up.

He started telling me how fat I was. How stupid I must be to think people REALLY liked me. Ugly, cant cook (went to culinary school. I laughed at that and got backhanded). My baby (never our baby) would be just as worthless as me. I shoulda had an abortion. He hit my stomach once. I almost lost her. 

Then, he left. One day while I was at work, he took his stuff, his car and all my food and gone. Called 2 days later. He missed me, loved me, you know the routine. 

I think the worst thing he did was try to convince me to kill myself and my baby. Save the world the ""burden"" we will be. How could I be sure this was HIS baby. I was a self proclaimed whore. I should of  just aborted baby and been done. 
Nobody really loved us. They just pitied us and played nice. He shoved me down a small flight of stairs, 2 days before she was born. Because I held the door open for him. I can go on for hours. 

This lasted 8 months. He walked out for good on December 20th. It was the most violent I, personally, have ever been in my life. 

He came to my house, told me I was doing everything wrong with baby. We hadn't seen him in 2 weeks. We were doing just fine. 
I'd gotten courage built up and told him to just leave. We didn't need this treatment or him. 

He flipped. Literally. Grabbed me, shoved me on the couch and backhanded me several times. NOBODY speaks to him that way. He grabbed my throat and started squeezing. Baby was in her bassinet next to the couch. I found strength somewhere and got him off me. 

As I was catching my breath, he kicked baby over. I. Was. DONE. 
I lunged for my baby on the floor, and shielded from the kick he delivered. It broke 2 of my ribs and would have killed her.  I layed there a minute, soothing baby. He walked down the hall and told me to ""shut that screaming bitch up before I do forever"". I put baby in her room, locked the door and pocketed the key. She would be safe in her crib. 

I walked to my kitchen and grabbed a 10 inch butcher knife and walked to my bathroom, where he was. And waited at the door. As soon as he opened it, I had the knife to his throat. I told him if he ever, EVER showed up again,I'd kill him. If he didn't walk right out my front door forever, I'd kill him in sixty seconds. If I ever saw him anywhere near MY baby, I'd kill him. If he could not tell, this was it. We would never speak outside of court again. He left. Within sixty seconds. I haven't seen, heard or sensed him since that day. 

My baby is just fine. She was more scared than anything. I had her checked by my neighbor who's a NICU nurse. 

I never needed his money. I have my own. I don't want child support, because that forces me to let him see her. I want zero contact. Baby has my last name because he wasn't there to sign papers. 

I'm in therapy to recover. To heal my damage so I can be a strong, good Mom for my miracle baby.
I've been trying to get this out beyond therapy. Thank you if you read this jumble.

fstqp7,"Unsure, MyBoyfriend is Verbally Abusive but pushed me violently","I am unsure how to react. I had my daughter over to our house, as I have the past two months or so. She wants a puppy so badly so a neighbor agreed to let us “borrow” their dog for a few hours. 
I had posted on our community page about this, and someone responded the next morning. They wanted to meet at 1045, I read this at 1030...so ecstatically I got my daughter and I dressed and headed out the door. 
Of course the ring doorbell captured this, and I immediately got a call from my BFF asking what I was doing. Because I was trying to talk to the neighbor, I ignored his calls. When I finally had a sec, he berated me and cussed me out for “bitch buttoning” him. 
Got the dog, had a great day...my daughter fed the dog some eggs and cherry tomatoes when I wasn’t looking. Said dog naturally barfed it up in the backyard. 
Fast forward to the next day, bf knew dog was over but wondered about the cherry tomatoes in the yard. I lied, I didn’t want him to get mad. While FaceTiming my daughter he asked he and then I eventually told him. A full out argument between him &amp; I ensured. He blocked me from entering the house, screamed, and yelled at me. He called me every name in the book. I was so bewildered....all this over cherry tomatoes in the backyard.
End of the story, I sat on the couch to watch Netflix. He turned it off and kept pushing me down, violently. This happened 6 or 7 times. To diffuse the situation I tried to go to bed, he yanked me out of bed and yelled at me to get out. I went in the guest room and locked
It. He found the key and continued yelling. 
While I understand I should have been truthful about the dog barf, this behavior seems completely irrational. Am I right in my thinking? He hasn’t put his hands on me before but is often verbally abusive. 

I need advice. Are these red flags to the point I should leave? I would also note I’m financially dependent on him at the moment, so idk where I’d go.",nellbell87,2020-03-31 22:49:12,2,389,51.83,40.87,86.1,1.02,12.97,15.42,89.2,57.33,20.57,17.48,11.83,0.77,0,4.37,0.51,3.08,7.46,13.62,6.68,4.88,8.23,1.03,17.99,2.06,0.51,1.29,1.29,1.03,5.4,1.03,4.37,0.77,2.83,0,12.08,1.03,1.29,1.29,4.37,8.74,1.54,0.77,1.8,2.57,1.03,2.06,2.57,0.77,1.54,0.26,0.77,0.26,0,0,0.51,6.43,2.31,0.51,1.54,1.54,0.51,9,5.66,0.77,18.25,3.34,9.25,6.43,1.03,0.77,3.34,0.51,0,0,1.03,0.26,0.77,0,0,0.26,17.22,9.51,4.37,0,0.26,0.51,0,0,1.03,1.29,0,0.26
fsv4t7,abuse? repressed memories?,"hi reddit. im gonna use my throwaway account to post this for obvious reasons i guess.

when i was 8, my 2 sisters, mum and i went overseas. my siblings and i thought we were going for a holiday, but we ended up living there for 8 months with my brother in law and half-sister. (my mum lied to us). 

while there, i went through some things. even though people have told me its abuse, i doubt myself everyday.

1) at that young age, either 8 or 9?( sorry my brain is fuzzy) i was not very good at keeping up with normal habits, such as wearing underwear. my underwear did not fit me properly, so i often didnt wear it. also, as a little girl i wore boxers so i hated how underwear felt, again, dont judge me but i didnt wear underwear.

i dont remember how my brother in law knew this, but everyday he would ""check if i was wearing underwear"", spare very few days. i remember, in the kitchen (though it may of happened elsewhere too, i dont remember) he would either pull my pants down, or more commonly because i wore skirts and dresses, grab me by the waist, turn me completely upside down, and if i wasn't wearing any underwear i was now non-consentually exposed to him and my family he did it in front of. my entire bottom half- it was even worse if i was turned upside down because it meant he was directly looking at my vagina. i was 8 or 9, again. i would tell him to stop and put me down. he wouldnt. this had led to me now days having issues with being ignored. it makes me feel as ignored and helpless as i did back then.

i keep saying its my fault because i should have just worn underwear. most days i didnt, hoping he wouldnt 'check'. on the days i did because i was scared he would, he would say ""i got lucky this time and did the right thing"" or something along those lines. again, this was nearly everyday for 8 months. he once did it infront of guests, which proceeded me to run into my bedroom closet and cry.

2) i was forced to eat my dinner every night, which is normal for picky kids who dont like healthy food of course, but the thing was i struggled to eat vegetables and similar foods for years before i lived here. it made me gag and almost throw up. it was extremely hard and instead of trying to adjust me to it. if i couldnt eat i either sat alone at the kitchen table for hours struggling to eat and gagging at each bite till i was done, or if i couldnt finish it because it was too much for 8 or 9 y/o me to handle, i would be locked up in the bathroom for, what i remember to be, a few hours. in my house- there was a bathroom with the shower, bath, sink, and then there was a separate room for the toilet. which was less than 1 square meter in size. i was locked in the separate room for the toilet, i would sit on the cold floor. the only thing i could do was read a list of rules stuck to the door. i remember there was 8 rules. i do not remember what those rules were. the whole time all i could do was either try to sleep (never was able to because of the size of the room), think till i was crying with boredom and begging someone to let me out, or read the rules over and over. one time, after being locked up for about 2 hours, my brother in law wanted to go toilet. he opened the door, and i was so confused after being in there for what felt so long to me as a young child that i just sat there, not knowing what to do, he told me needed to go toilet and i still couldnt do anything. he told me to hurry up and wait in the bathroom if i didnt want to see him take a piss. i waited in the bathroom, on the side of the bath-tub, till he was done and i was locked back in.

i do not remember if there was an actual lock on the outside, or if i was just too scared and thought i deserved my punishment too much to leave the separate room for the toilet. either way, i hated it in there. occasionally instead of being in that room, i would be locked in my bedroom from 7pm till the next morning or if my mum let me out that night (we shared a room and i could never sleep when i was locked up without her). the room had to have the door closed, the curtains closed and the lights off. i am now scared of falling asleep with my curtains closed or door closed. i have to have both open, though i can sleep in the dark.

3) he would say things like, i wish you guys didnt live here so i could walk around the house naked. he would leave vulgar magazines around the house, though i dont remember specifically what was on them. when he realized i loved sharing a room with my mum, he switched me into another room, taking away something precious to me when i was locked up in my room. i vaguely remember being locked in my closet and getting dressed in my closet. i dont know why.

4) he wouldnt let my sister get dressed with the door locked or closed. she would have to dress in the closet because of it, from what i remember.

5) i was not taught basic hygiene when i lived there and as a result didn't shower, brush my teeth, bathe, and ended up with ALOT of head lice.

6) my half-sister cut my hair that had been growing since i was a baby and reached down to my buttocks. she made me ugly and gave me a fringe that looked bad on me. i know this is not abuse but it made me sad, none-the-less i guess.

7) he would force my sisters to drink (hard liquor), not enough to be drunk but still very illegal obviously. he didnt do this to me.

8) he owned a very fast skyline car. one time he took my sisters and i in it and drove out to an empty road and sped up so fast that i was jumping up and down in my seat (i dont remember if i was wearing a seat-belt or not) and the speed thing was past the max number. i was in complete silence the whole time out of shock. it was supposed to be ""fun"".

9) the rest of the memories seem to be ok, actually.

8) there are chunks of time missing from certain times in that 8 months and i have a super fuzzy timeline from near the time we were leaving to go back to where we came from to a few years later. i was subject to living with an alcoholic (different man completely, in a different city but in the country we lived in where the previously mentioned happened) after this. he would leave me on the beach alone to drink in a pub. and forced my mum and i to walk home in the dark because he was too drunk to drive us and hated us when he was drunk. we walked across an entire city to get home. i thought it was fun but looking back now that was very dangerous for a tiny women that my mum is and the little child i was. he kicked us out after i called him an idiot (literally thats all it took to get kicked out the house) for screaming and swearing at my mother while being drunk like he always was at night being the alcoholic he is.

sorry for the life story i guess. thats not all that has happened to me. i have also witnessed physical abuse and stuff i guess. but that was a completely different story that took place years later.

&amp;#x200B;

when i write it all out like this, i feel like i am exaggerating even though i am just writing down the facts of what happened. writing this down and reading makes me think ""of course thats abuse"" but when i then imagine the context and how it happened to me i doubt myself again even though i know it is. but is it?

im scared that i have repressed memories of other things. because of the missing chunks of time. i wont go into detail.

fsvkq4,help?,"disclaimer; this isnt really urgent, im not in (too much) danger. i think. also i just got this reddit account so im not 100% sure how to navigate this, my apologies. 
also content warning for suicide mention, self harm, and generally upsetting stuff. sorry. 

so. 
my mom has bipolar disorder, suffers from childhood abuse and depression. she's been through a lot.
im 15 years old, queer, and her son. 

my dad cheated on her when i was 11, and i attempted suicide for unrelated reasons at 14. since the attempt, its been all downhill with my mom. 

i really dont know all that much about my mom, but i do know that she has screamed at me about how she thinks about killing herself because of me, sometimes actually threatens to kill herself.

i go and visit my dad and his girlfriend often (theyre very nice and are great supports for my mental health, which is very unexpected, long story), and most times before i leave, my mom asks if she did something wrong, and if she should leave me alone forever. sometimes she starts sobbing violently. 
i have nightmares about her screaming at me, nightmares of her killing myself, just nightmares every night. its hard to sleep nowadays. 

its really fucking difficult. i already deal with depression and anxiety and suicide, and having this extra weight is the biggest burden of my life, and i dont know what to do with it. 

i guess what i wanna know from yall is, 
is this actually abuse? i dont feel like it is. my mom was one of the closest people in my life, and abuse is only caused by really malicious people. or thats what i think. 
do i have trauma? 
and should i feel bad when she suicide baits me and stay with her, even though i feel like shit when im around her?

i have a million more questions, but this page is long enough as it is.

fsvsdt,Emotional Abuse Still Leaves Scars,"﻿Emotional abuse literally drives you crazy. You constantly think you’re overreacting or that maybe you did deserve the abusive behavior. My father is an attorney so I’ve always learned to have evidence to back up anything I say, with emotional abuse, it’s very difficult to find evidence outside of a few text messages or emails.

&amp;#x200B;

 I had tried explaining what was going on to one therapist I had while I was still unsure of what I was going through and she told me his actions weren’t abusive. So, I stayed. This is why I always recommend you interview multiple therapists before just picking one to listen to. Had I stayed with that therapist longer, who knows where I would be. After I left the relationship, the lack of evidence drove me insane. I was always in so much psychological pain. I couldn’t interact with others without tears forming from his voice in my head or having memories pop into my head. I always looked depressed and was never invited to anything as I wasn’t “fun” enough. I became very aggressive during this time. I was kicked out of a bar and the bouncer called me a bitch/cunt and I went off. Next thing I know I woke up in the hospital with two black eyes. They weren’t from the bouncer, I had drunkenly stumbled and fell flat on my face. I was so shocked to see how awful I looked, but was at the same time relieved because I was finally able to see pain. Please note that I do NOT recommend accidental or voluntary self harm as according to one of my other therapists, that is common for emotional abuse survivors. Instead we need to break our silence and educate and have people start looking deeper than the skin level and understand that the scars that lie beneath can truly be the deepest.

fsw91x,Is my mom crazy??,"( sorry for my bad grammar) Hey, this is something that's been happening for about a week right now. So  around last friday my mother (who is a christian, specifically seventh day Adventist ) must of opened up a scripture or something and saw something that told her to get out of the cities. She then instantly started packing up everything in the house and wanted to go to her mother's/ my grandmother's house, I luckily calmed her down just before we were gonna go only because of me barely convincing my grandmother that we shouldnt go over there then telling her to listen to grandma, during that she was yelling at me and taking her anger out on he dog, it was better for like 3 days after that, then just today we felt an earthquake,  and she started crying because she thought that jesus was coming. It was the type of cry that you know people are insane when they do it, after that she started to pack again, this time for an earthquake. I tried to make her calm down again, but she wouldn't.  She even told me that I should stop doing homework because god is coming soon. ( I'm an atheist just so you know) , now it's around 2 am and she got up and started to tell me some christian stuff, I told her politely that I dont wanna talk about religious stuff but she told me in a very rude voice that she would keep telling me stuff and that she didnt care and that she wanted me to become a Christian ect.  Then eventually after she yelled at me she went back to her bedroom. Now its 2:47 am and shes looking at gas charges. I dont know what to do, I dont know if im in the wrong or right. It's very hard to tell when I'm around her because I was raised by her. Thanks to anyone who read this and please get back to me soon. I dont know if going out into the mountains would be the best course of action.",z1ll4z,2020-04-01 02:06:18,2,355,14.48,71.35,45.24,17.57,25.36,12.96,94.37,66.48,25.63,16.34,7.32,0.85,0.56,7.32,0.28,9.3,3.94,14.65,10.7,8.17,7.89,1.97,23.66,3.66,1.97,1.41,1.41,0.28,5.07,2.25,2.82,0,1.13,0.85,15.49,1.69,0,8.45,0.28,10.99,2.54,1.41,3.1,3.1,0.85,1.97,2.25,0.56,1.13,0.56,0,0,0,0,0,5.63,0.85,0.85,2.25,1.69,0.85,6.76,12.39,3.38,18.87,2.54,7.04,9.86,0.85,0,1.13,0,1.97,0,0.85,0,0.28,0,0,0,12.39,3.66,3.66,0.28,0,0.56,0,0,0,2.25,1.69,0.28
fsx8rg,I feel like i was sexually abused both as an adult and kid and I forgot ...,"I come from a single mother family, my mom was very abusive, she would beat me and my brother a lot not like beat the shit out of us. But spank us, pinch us, sometimes throw food at us, throw the telphone, shake us uncontrollably etc. It was very unsettling although I know people who've had it worse. Recently I thought about times where my mom would give me suppositories and I would cry and scream from that. The thought of it gave me a panick attack that's why  I'm here. Idk why it's such a traumatic thought because I know parents would do that if kids refused to take pills back in the day. There was also another time I got parasitic worms when I was really young. And my mom made this homemade garlic paste or whatever and shoved it up my ass. You can imagine how painful and uncomfortable having a brush with garlic shoved up your ass is. I cried a lot and it didn't even get rid of the worms I had to get antibiotics.

Now fast forward to adulthood, this is what is confusing me. I developed a lot of substance abuse problems in my late teenage years. By the time I was 20 I had a real drug problem and underlying mental health problems. I was on adhd medication for school and work, and I would smoke a lot of weed so that gave me bad anxiety. Then I started experimenting with pyschadelics which was the start of all this chaos. When I'd take mushrooms I'd have to go hide somewhere. My paranoia started with the mushrooms. I feel like I got raped around this time period, but at the same time my brain was so mangled from drugs it's like I was a schizophrenic and I actually ended up in a mental hospital a few months later anyway. The substance abuse paranoia gave me weird thoughts. Like I was dating this girl at the time and I was convinced she was raping me in my sleep w a strap on or shoving stuff up my ass. I also thought she was following me, stalking me, and sleeping w my friends. She actually had a party once where I got black out drunk. I feel like I got raped at that party too for some reason cause I couldn't shit for days. And I've been blackout before where I'm thinking wow what a night! Good times. But I remember the morning after that I was thinking did I get raped or something. And my mind since then has been fixated on rape scenarios and I get dreams where I'm bout to be raped. And my biggest fear suddenly became rape after that time period of substance abuse. Is my mind making this up because I was super mangled on drugs?  Do you think there's a possibility I got raped in my sleep by this girl or I got raped at that party? Is my mind correlating to the child trauma of getting stuff shoved up my ass ?

fszry2,My nephew is being abused and i'm not sure what to do,"Okay so i've never actually been one to post on reddit but i need help and nows a better time than ever.  


My nephew (His mom is my sister-in-law) is a 2 year old ball of joy who's been through allot, his father was a married man who fled to another state, his mother has been sleeping around with anyone and everyone for a minute, all while trying to leach money from everyone she knows and loves and has used having a child as a way to extort my mother in law  


Enter my sister-in-laws new boyfriend, he recently had a child with her and has been the financial giver shes wanted for a while, but heres the catch - my nephew started showing signs of abuse, and i mean black and blue all over type of abuse, and my sister in law saw this and had my mother in law take my nephew to care for him and when she picked my nephew up you could even see how bad it was in that house, just by how his face was (It was blue in i think 2 spots, by the lip and by the eye), welp now she wants him back and is rationalizing the abuse because ""Every parent does this"", i'm not having it.  


While he has no marks on him currently, we did make sure to document things, and we have a ton of pictures of my nephew and texts of the childs own mother saying its an abusive situation at home, i want to be a good uncle and save the day but there's pressure from the wifes side of the family to leave it be and that ain't how its going to happen and the sooner i can get the kid in my mother-in-laws custody the better

i want to call cps, i just need help and advice, thanks.

ft13i1,Was this abuse?,"I don’t know the whole story, but from my experience it’s abuse, and what’s going on makes no sense. 


I’m repeating days sometimes, or I’ll go back to several days ago and watch everything around me happen again. Mentally, I’m all here but my mind is just repeating verbally the same story, what is going on? I don’t want to hear this anymore with my own ears, literally. 

A man a year ago really scared me. He was targeting me specifically. It was him, his girlfriend, two friends of someone’s, and a man in a mustang, and a child. 
I was standing on a sidewalk when the man in the car approached me and parked and the kid yelled something out at me. He did a circle and the girl was gone and he parked, and then he did another circle and he stopped and parked. The man I’m specially talking about was parked behind me with his front windshield fogging in what was not even a cold or hot day, I couldn’t see his face. I heard later he was a lawyer. 

Upon that third turn around, I walked inside away from the mustang driver and stood inside the building I was around and made a phone call to a parent explaining what happened and how scared I was. The girl was downstairs in the lobby of this building on her phone. She turned around real quick before turning away, fast. The friends in front of her never looked away from me I waited in there for my ride and left. My rides car had been looked through, there was a white power substance on the floorboards and on the glovebox. The man man in the car that was foggy looked at me completely wide eyed before driving off. His girlfriend stayed there because she said she didn’t want to be with him anymore and wanted to be with the man she was previously upstairs with I saw when I also was up there, and she walked back. The mustang driver left after doing a few loops and drove off before. And another guy in a car tried taking a photo before stepping out his car as we drove up and getting back in. I don’t know what he had to say. 

I know I was targeted in some way I can’t explain. But as I write this, PLEASE ABUSE, did she do this to him on purpose? I have thought she searched the car but I didn’t look on the lobby to see if she was still there. I have thought she told him to? I have thought later on I’d hear it was true he wanted power but that he’s abusive. I have thought about he got himself into a trap and was taking advice from the texting they were doing. If he isn’t, he’s been made to be a monster by someone I didn’t trust when I first saw her. He could really end up in court by me if the truth doesn’t come out.",Fiamondrocks1,2020-04-01 07:46:16,0,512,38.6,51.56,81.45,17.28,17.07,12.3,93.36,64.06,20.12,15.43,8.2,0.2,0,6.84,0.2,4.69,7.62,15.04,11.33,5.66,8.01,2.54,22.85,3.52,1.95,1.76,0.59,1.37,2.15,0.78,1.37,0.39,0.98,0,14.45,0.2,0.98,2.73,6.05,10.16,1.95,1.17,1.76,1.95,1.37,3.52,5.47,2.93,1.76,0.39,0.59,0.59,0,0,0,4.88,1.37,0.59,1.56,0.98,0.39,12.3,8.4,0.78,21.29,4.69,10.74,6.84,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.48,5.08,3.71,0,0,0.78,0,0,0,3.91,0,0
ft216t,Is my mother abusive?,"My mom works as an in home daycare provider. She takes care of 2 kids not including her 4 year old son. Yesterday she was so mad at one of the kids because he cries a lot and is sensitive, that she exclaimed multiple times using the f word, not to him but in regards to him. Today, my little brother used the f word twice while playing with toys, it was completely out of the blue and she sent him to time out, which obviously was the right choice, but the next things is what is really disturbing me. He kept screaming and crying for a couple minutes and told one of the kids that if he wasn't quiet he would hurt him. My mom decided to hit his head against the wall where he was, pick him up and lift him by one arm across the house and sit him down roughly on the counter in the kitchen. I'm pretty sure he hit his head on the cabinet. She then proceeded to put hot sauce in his mouth and when he tried to spit it out, she facepalmed him. Then she picked him up and shoved his head into another corner for more time out. I will note he was not hit when put in that corner.



Other notable things she has done:

Made me and my 12 year old brother do a lot of the babysitting work

On her phone constantly while the toddlers play, including outside

Locked one of the kids in the garage because he kept crying in time out, something she has done multiple times

Sends a 3 year old to time out constantly for something the four year old (my brother) was doing with him.

And for reference, she sends people to time out probably 5+ times per day, whereas when I went to an in home daycare as a kid where there were way more kids, only maybe one kid got sent to time out per day.",gustavo-fring-2020,2020-04-01 08:37:13,6,353,70.74,82.51,36.82,14.12,25.21,13.03,92.92,56.37,17,13.31,3.12,0,0,10.2,0,3.68,7.08,15.58,5.95,3.97,7.93,1.13,14.45,2.55,1.13,1.98,3.4,2.27,4.82,1.98,2.83,0.57,0.57,1.13,16.71,2.27,0,4.53,7.65,9.63,0.85,2.27,0.57,2.27,1.13,3.12,1.7,0.28,0.85,0.57,2.55,1.7,0,0,0.57,4.82,1.42,0.85,1.98,0.57,0,6.8,5.1,0.85,22.66,2.55,9.92,10.2,0.57,1.42,1.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.92,3.68,4.25,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,0,0.57,0.57,0.28
ft3ux7,This is my story.,"Four years ago, I met a guy who I thought was incredible and that we had an amazing connection. But this relationship ended up being a big, horrible, roller coaster ride. 

When we first met, we dated for 5 months then we broke up. Tragic. He went back with his ex girlfriend, ended up breaking up with her in Feb 2017 and came back to me but we were unofficial. For a while we were find until he told me he was talking to other girl and he’s starting to like her a lot, so I stepped away only for him to decide that he didn’t want her anymore and came back. We were “together” again until he met someone else during Halloween 2017. This time I felt that he replaces me so easily but I let them be. I blocked both of them on everything and I even changed my number. Soon after changing my number, people told me he was trying to get a hold of me, I ignored it because I didn’t want him in my life anymore and I was moving on from him. But.. he found a way to reach out to me and I was dumb enough to start dating him, again.  *official dating. He said all the right things to the point where I thought I was living a fairy tale, but don’t you know fairy tales aren’t real? I was slowly falling into a nightmare.

It all started when we went to one of his friend’s wedding. We were having a blast until the end. We were dancing for a long time and at some point he wanted to try a new dance move. However, I didn’t want to because my feet started to hurt. I told him my feet hurt and that I wanted to sit down for a little bit. He still tried to get me to do the dance move, but I told him, “not right now,” kissed him and I went to our table, taking off my heels. Soon after, he came up to the table. I smiled at him and I remember trying to make him sit with me and showed him my feet that they were red from my heels but I was laughing about it and said something along the lines, “I haven’t danced that much since forever but—“. But before I can say my full sentence, he looked at me with a stern look and said “You ruined the night. Are you happy with yourself?” For a second, I thought he was kidding because throughout the years we have known each other he never spoke to me that way. So I asked, “Are you serious” with a slight laugh and he replied with “Yeah, you ruined the fucking night. Be happy with yourself. Congratulations. This could have been an amazing night and you ruined it.” I ran off to the bathroom, crying a little bit. I soothe myself with the thoughts, “He had a lot to drink today, he’s just drunk.” When I came back out, the bride and groom were preparing to walk out of the venue and people were standing outside with sparklers. One of his friends called me over and asked if I was okay, I told her what had happened. She said “He’s drunk, he probably just wants to fight.” And I was like yeah. When everything was done, he helped clean the venue and I thought everything was okay because he kept coming up to me with a nice tone and kept giving me his stuff for he didn’t forget them at the venue. While walking to his car, which was blocks away, he started to yell at me for “ruining” the night and I was walking slowly because I didn’t want to hear it but he was threatening to leave me there if I didn’t walk faster. *Fyi all my personal items were in his car (keys, wallet, etc). When we got to his car, he was slamming his doors and he started to yell even louder at me and kept telling me I ruined everything and that I made him look like a fool on the dance floor. Throughout this whole time, he kept calling me a cunt, bitch and a loser and he was flinging his hands super close to me.  Throughout the car ride, I thought at some point he was going to hit me so I kept flinching and mentally was preparing myself. He didn’t hit me but he yelled at me for a hour or so. When everything was over, he kept apologizing and convinced me to go downtown with him to meet with the rest of the party. I agreed to go because I didn’t want to be yelled at anymore or anger him more. I pretended that everything was okay. At the end of the night, when we got home, we didn’t say much and just went to bed. I cried myself to sleep while listening to his drunk snores. 

During the month of August, I constantly wanted to break things off with him because I kept thinking he will randomly just going to leave me like he had in the past. It was a pattern to me. He begged me to stay and convinced me to stay by using all the right words and everything that I desperately wanted to hear throughout the years we were together. So I stayed.

Sept 2, 2018: We started to argue because I said a comment about his ex girlfriend who had slept with his old roommate. I didn’t want to tell him how I got the information so he got angry with me. I told him it doesn’t matter and he started to yell at me for bad mouthing his ex.  I told him that he always said nasty things  about me with his exes and let them talk bad about me to make them happy but god forbid if I said a comment that wasn’t close to being mean about an ex. When I defended myself, he got even more angry. We fought for 2 hours. During the fight, at some point, I was standing at the doorway. He grabbed/squeezed me really hard at both sides that I even said “ouch, stop” and then tossed me to the side. I almost hit my head against a counter. I locked myself in the bathroom, crying and I called a friend telling him what had happened. After the phone call, my first thought was I’m going to ruin his reputation so I texted my friend back and gave him an excuse that it was an accident. He didn’t believe me but I convince him everything was okay. 

Sept 7, 2018: We went out with friends to downtown, it was a great night until the end. I don’t remember why the fight started, I was blamed for it anyways. During our fight, he started to yell at me that I was a bitch, a disgrace to the humankind, I was a cunt and many, many other foul things. I didn’t even defend myself, just made smartass responses like, “yup, I’m a complete bitch.” He didn’t really appreciate that and approached me with a look. A look that I will always remember, a look that he looked like he was so disconnected and full of hatred at the same time. This time, I really thought I was going to get hit and I covered my face with my hands. But instead, he went over to my counter and started to grab my plants and throwing them to the ground. Shuttering every single one. One of the plants, he knew how hard I was working on to make it grow big and also knew how long it took me to find a perfect pot for it (an expensive pot). I remember I told him to stop, and he just stared at me and threw it at my feet, cutting my foot slightly. I was devastated over that plant.* I told him to get out and to leave and that I was done, we are over. He tried to guilt trip saying “I came all this way to come see you, just to see you” “you made me get this angry.” I just kept telling him to leave. He got up to leave and I told him to call one of his friends because he was too drunk but he didn’t listen, so I followed him to the stairs. I slipped on the stairs because my shoes were wet and the first thing he said when he saw me fall was,  “that’s what you get,” and walked off.  I went back to my apartment, tried to clean up but couldn’t, I started to feel so much pain so I laid in bed. I was in the worse pain possible. I got up thinking he’s going to get arrested being out drunk so I called one of his friends. He ended up coming back to my apartment and I let him in. He started to clean up my plants and put them in extra pots that I had (the plant that I was working hard on, completely died in a week). Around 4 am, I told him I wanted to go to the ER because I couldn’t stand the pain. I couldn’t move. While we were getting ready to go to the hospital, he did a quick movement near me that scared me. I remember I just rolled over and started to cry because I didn’t have anyone else to help me right now. That I’m alone and was in so much pain. My mind started think all sorts of things. I kept thinking that I was vulnerable and that he can do anything to me. That he could just not take me to the hospital and let me suffer in the pain. Everytime he came near, I thought he was going to push me around or that I was going to get hit. I started to get a panic attack. I started to think that I couldn’t breathe and I’m going to die like this. At some point, I hyperventilated and passed out. During this time, he called 911. They took me away, I got more scared and I had other panic attack. In the ambulance, the medic kept on asking if my ex pushed me, has he hurt me etc. I just remember telling him no but I started to cry so don’t think I convinced the medics. They didn’t allow him to see me until I told them that I was 100% sure it was okay and I didn’t want cops to be called. I had broken my tailbone from the fall, I didn’t get out of the hospital until 6 am. 

A month later, I broke things off with him. During the last month, I barely talked. I didn’t want to upset him. When I did talk, I tried to choose my words wisely and was careful with every little action I did around him. I was happy, I wasn’t joyful and half the time I pretended that I was happy. 

The last day we were together, we finished our Netflix series and I told him that I was leaving the next day (we lived in different states around this time) and that it was time for us to be completely out of each other’s lives. That it was over. Before I left, he hold me for the longest time. He cried and apologize many many times for hurting me. I remember just wiping his tears, kissed him one last time and smiled and left. I cried throughout the drive back home but I felt a great release. That I can breath again. 

Weeks went by and I started to think about our relationship and I slowly had the realization that I was in an abusive relationship. I started to cry even more and discussed it with people to help me cope. I realized that he constantly made me feel stupid and that I was always wrong. He made me think that I caused all the fights and it was my fault for always creating tension. I was constantly reminded that being raped and sexually abused was my fault that I received the unwanted attention. He shut me down when I was trying to be silly with him or happy. I stopped receiving compliments and he didn’t like it when I was around any other guys when he wasn’t with me. He stopped calling me cute pet names (hun, babe, sweetie and other nicknames he had for me) but only did it when he needed something. He stopped giving me physical attention. Surprisingly he never stopped saying I love you. I was manipulated. I thought I was in love with him, but really, I wasn’t I was just wrapped around his finger for some reason. I seriously thought he needed me around for I can help him because his mom killed herself and he wasn’t mentally stable.  Abuse isn’t always physical. I was abused physically, emotional, verbally and controlled. I didn’t leave because I thought he needed help. I didn’t leave because I blamed the alcohol and stress. I didn’t leave because I thought that I was in a fairy tale. But I left because I knew it wasn’t my fairy tale anymore. 

After a year being out of the relationship and freed from him, I’ve been traveling a lot more and I feel happier. I escaped. 

Thank you for reading my story. I know many women who have suffer way worse than me but any type of abuse is traumatizing and no ones pain is below the other.",thatothergirI,2020-04-01 10:12:04,5,2298,26.96,46.69,85.09,3.6,16.53,11.97,95.08,61.36,25.46,20.45,11.84,1.22,0.61,6.31,0.48,5,5.05,13.14,8.05,4.57,7.66,2,21.89,3.26,1.17,1.13,1.13,1.87,6.53,2.09,4.4,0.52,1.7,1.17,15.06,0.09,0.57,0.44,6.14,11.36,2.61,1.74,1.22,1.44,1.35,3.57,2.92,0.61,1.22,1.09,2.09,0.78,0.83,0.13,0.3,7.27,2.96,0.7,1.91,1.17,0.83,12.53,6.09,0.83,16.75,3.87,6.66,6.92,0.09,0.78,0.52,0.04,0.04,0.13,1,0.3,0.04,0.35,0.04,0.04,14.49,6.05,4.09,0.09,0,0.09,0,0,1.22,2.31,0.44,0.22
ft5rnq,Was it sexual assault/abuse?,"Ok so one of my biggest problems is the doubt I have about the abuse. I don’t know if what happened constitutes assault and I have been having doubts about it. So I am asking for the opinion of people on this subreddit because it just is really bothering me.

So when I was 12 I was at my uncles cottage and I was in the lake with the neighbour’s kid who was ~3-4 years older than me I think, and we were play fighting kind of. He brought us to a place in the lake that was covered by trees so no one could see us, and he pulled me towards him and wrapped his legs around mine and held them closed. He was holding my wrists before he reached down and started touching/grabbing me through my swim trunks which were just soccer shorts. I don’t know how many times he touched me, it may have only been once I don’t remember. I was trying to escape and I was saying stop. It didn’t last very long I don’t think and he didn’t really do anything but touch and grab me. Does that count as sexual assault? I don’t know anymore. It’s just really overwhelming. I hate feeling the doubt along with the pain. It makes it so much worse.",Daniel_128,2020-04-01 11:33:24,3,227,4.36,20.14,72.95,1,15.13,13.66,92.95,63.88,23.79,16.74,11.45,1.32,0,3.52,0.44,7.05,3.96,9.69,14.1,7.93,9.25,3.52,22.91,2.64,2.64,2.2,2.64,0.88,7.49,0.88,6.61,1.76,3.52,0.44,8.81,0.44,0.44,0,3.96,12.33,3.08,1.32,1.32,3.96,0,3.52,3.96,0.44,0.44,3.08,2.2,0.88,0.44,0.88,0,7.49,1.32,0.44,2.64,0,3.08,8.81,10.13,0.44,11.45,1.76,5.29,4.41,0,1.32,0.44,0,0,0,0.44,0,0,0.44,0,0,13.66,5.73,1.32,0,0,0.88,0,0.44,0,3.96,0,1.32

ftbm2h,Verbally abusive sibling moved back in.,"(!!! TW for suicidal thoughts &amp; self harm mentioned !!!)


And I’m feeling suicidal again.

This sibling has gotten a divorce and recently (literally a couple of weeks ago) moved back in. Sometimes my nephew comes over, and that’s the only positive because he’s cute and a baby and isn’t mean like my sibling yet. Anyway.

This sibling is the cause of so many of my issues. My social anxiety, my lack of self esteem, the fact I still have selective mutism as an adult woman, the reason I don’t trust anyone and believe every single person is out to get me. 

They verbally abused me my entire life, and physically hit me so I flinch a lot when people raise their arms even a little bit near me.

They allowed their friends to abuse and harass me, too; their first partner when i was in middle school chased me out of my own house and I stayed at the park for hours until my parents got home (i was 11 or 12). The sibling and their friend in high school went through my old phone (back when smartphones were becoming a thing) and went through my journals and made fun of me for days over them.

They’re just so mean and I don’t understand why. They don’t see myself or my younger sibling as human beings, but they’re kind to our parents and grandparents. I jsut don’t understand.

What the fuck.

Anyway I just felt suicidal 

I feel trapped. I’m an adult who needs to move but as a college student and someone with severe social anxiety Im just terrified I will never be able to take care of myself. I just turned 26 in December and I thought I’d be normal by now, but I guess abuse really does this to ppl.

Sibling abuse should be taken seriously. He was excused a lot growing up because “HAHA HE’S yoUr olDer BroTher bRoThers are supposed to be mean 🤪” and got away with saying so much. My feelings never mattered in this family, I was always a highly sensitive person but wow. 

I just.... wanna die. Guess I can go catch corona but i don’t wanna because other people would be infected, so Idk I feel like overdosing on my medication or cutting myself again—i haven’t self harmed since I was 19...

but man if i survive and end up in a hospital right now that would be an awful time, fuck idfk what to do. idk. I don’t know. This sucks. This really sucks.

ftf40y,I don't know if this is abuse or if I'm overreacting and overexaggerating,"So I’m writing this partially to just get it out, but I would like people’s advice and opinions.


So my older sibling and I have never gotten along. Me and my younger sibling fight sometimes, but neither of us escalate it to the same degree my older sibling does


My OS has anxiety, OCD, and ADHD, and contributes their behavior towards me to this. Throughout their life they have constantly belittled me and made me feel like I was less than their, they were always critical of everything I said and did, they once told me that it was better if I didn’t speak. I think this was because they weren't self confident even though they acted like the world was theirs to cover up their feelings, and I guess that makes their actions not as bad, but I don’t think that makes it totally ok.


They often have a tone of voice when talking to me that is condescending and snappy, with a very rude underone, and sometimes responds to the things I say with weird passive aggressive insults even if there was no conflict between us. Whenever I try to call them out for acting like that, they deny they meant it in any bad way. 


They’ll yell at me for the tiniest mistake and will humiliate me in front of others, they do this more often in front of their family.


Whenever I try to talk to their about any of their behavior they’ll try to bring up all my problems, pushing every concern I had back on me (either this was my fault, or “what about when you did this”) they’ll say I’m overreacting and will often literally laugh at me, saying “I can’t take this seriously” and do a little weird dance to mock me. They dismiss my concerns and act like I’m just a stubborn child.


Sometimes when I try to tell them how the thing that they did made me feel, they’ll put words in my mouth, like I’ll say: “I wish you would….” they’ll interrupt me and say “You wish I would just kill myself!”. They will act like they’re the most confident person in the world, and then when I try to communicate to their they’ll say they’s dumb and how they’ve tried to kill themself.


Sometimes they’ll interrupt what I’m saying just to tell me that my shirt is dirty or my hair needs to be combed, or that I should be working or studying instead of talking to them.


I’m not perfect. I have lots of problems that I’m trying to work on. Sometimes I make mistakes or overreact to the things they do. When I try to admit to my mistakes in arguments, saying stuff like “I admit I overreacted” or “i should have done this” they'll say stuff like “HA! You admitted you did that!” (or something like that) and any concession I make is turned against me in a way that prevents further dialogue. I try really hard to work out my problems with dialogues, but it's almost impossible.


A problem I have when interacting with them is that when they start to act in this way I suddenly start to remember every time they had belittled, humiliated, ignored, and tore me down at once, remembering things I should’ve forgotten long ago. I can’t handle that emotionally. It’s like I experience them all over again.

I just don’t know if this is just bullying, sibling conflicts, or if this constitutes emotional abuse. They aren't a parent or a partner, so I don;t know if this counts.


I'm sorry for any mistakes and I'm sorry if this is the wrong place, just tell me and I'll delete it.",catcatcatcatcat1234,2020-04-01 20:32:27,3,635,7.36,34.09,85.7,1,22.68,15.91,93.07,64.09,26.77,19.37,11.81,0.31,0.79,0,6.46,7.4,2.68,12.44,11.34,6.46,9.76,2.05,21.73,4.25,3.78,2.05,0.31,2.05,7.24,1.26,5.98,0.47,2.83,0.31,14.65,0.94,0.16,0,0,17.95,2.2,1.42,4.09,6.77,1.73,5.83,2.99,0,2.2,0.63,0.63,0.31,0.31,0,0,8.03,1.89,2.36,1.89,1.1,1.57,5.04,13.07,2.52,11.65,1.26,5.35,5.2,0.79,0.31,0.16,0,0,0.31,0.47,0.16,0.16,0.16,0,0,17.8,4.09,4.72,0.16,0.16,0,0.47,0,2.2,5.35,0.63,0
ftge28,My Ex's Dad is abusing her and he's a government agent,"(I'm not specifying his line of work because I'm afraid the father can find this post if I specify exactly what he works for.) My girlfriend and I recently broke up (We're both underage). We're still friends and I was just told that her father is starting to get physical again now that her family's being cooped in the house for a while. Before we dated her father would occasionally beat her. He even beat her on father's day. She does nothing wrong. She's a well rounded student and he takes his frustration out on her. When we dated there was no more abuse. I assumed it was because the father didn't want me knowing that he abused her. I'm not sure. But now that we've broken up and they're locked in because of the virus, he's getting frustrated and he's gonna start taking it out on her. In the past she's tried calling the police on him but they didn't believe her because of his occupation for the government. And things just got worse from there. Her mother doesn't acknowledge or confronted that she gets beaten. And her older sibling and younger sibling have no idea. And she doesn't want to tell them because it would probably hurt them. And they kind of hate her so they might not believe her. I don't know what to do.

This usually ends up with my mother ontop of the conversation asserting herself and saying she's right.

For example I'm call my mother out for being abusive and she'll say it isn't her fault or she will refute/down play her abusive actions and turn the blame on me and then I'll go to say that what she's saying isn't the case but suddenly I can't think of what to say in order to defend myself from her switch around.

At this point idk what it is or why it happens, could it be a mental block/my subconscious actively trying to avoid the confrontation?

I'll start with her mother. Her mother would abuse her mentally and physically. Make her feel like she's unwanted at times. Her mother would also throw things at her such as laptops and maybe books. Often time it would leave bruises on her body.

Her big brother would also abuse her. She was used to satisfy his pleasure. She was groped, ""hugged"", kissed, and was also told to touch his penis and do a handjob. I discovered this recently and my heart were crushed. He had her do things like that for 8 years since she was 7 years old. Her brother is 3 years older than her. He stopped doing this around 4 years ago when he got married with his current wife and became a father of 1 daughter. My gf told me to let it go but i really can't.

Because all of that she developed some destructive behaviours. She likes to cut herself thinking that it felt really good. I cried when she told me about this. She must've been through a lot.

I’m at my breaking point. Suicidal, not sleeping, and too afraid to leave my room because she is mean to me and tries to fuck with me whenever she can. She eats my food, she leaves her ringer on max so that I hear her phone go off 100 times an hour (she even has a different text tone for her new gf that she left me for so I get to hear that all day long), she calls me names and degrades me, and so many more things. I can’t take it anymore.

I’m leaving in a month and since I told her, she has been lashing out at me. I can’t handle this for another month. I could face misdemeanor charges for leaving my house, but I’m mentally unwell because of my situation and have been experiencing a lot of suicidal ideation (I won’t act on it, I know it will get better, but it scares me that this is where I am mentally).

ftr6zv,different kinds of abuse and their warning signs,"April is child abuse awareness month, this topic is still scene as very taboo, and while it can be an uncomfortable and upsetting topic, it’s important for people to be aware of what signs they can look for.

So in light of social distancing and quarantine causing many children to be stuck at home with their abusers, I decided to make a list of warning sides you can look for in any children in your life.

if a child is experiencing emotional or verbal abuse, or neglect, they may show signs such as:
- constantly apologizing (whether the situation calls for an apology or not)
- not asking for help when sad or sick
- socially recoiling and not trusting anyone
- going mute or nonverbal 
- feeling guilty for having their basic needs met
- headaches or stomachaches with no clear cause
- extreme behavior, such as being way too obedient or way too demanding

If a child is expierencing physical abuse, they may show signs such as: 
- flinching when a hand is raised near them
- feeling the need to stick to someone they trust
- socially recoiling and not trusting anyone
- going mute or nonverbal
- having unexplained bruises or cuts
- suddenly becoming less hyper or active
- unexplained anger or tantrums
- getting anxious or scared by banging or screaming
- avoiding any kind of touch or physical contact
- wearing clothings that doesn't match the weather (ex. long sleeve shirts or pants to hide bruises)

if a child is expierencing sexual abuse, they may show signs such as: 
- having bruises on their wrists, thighs, or hips
- having blood or unexplained stains on their underwear or pants
- having bladder inconsistencies
- complaining about pain or itching of their genitals
- sexually projecting onto other children or family members 
- refusing to get naked in front of anyone

ftrbie,Abusive father keeps making me feel guilty for never talking to him,"I just wanna say this to someone because it's really annoying me.
Growing up my dad was super abusive and unfair. Now hes divorced and lives alone. Me and my brothers and sisters dont talk to him and hes frequently complained that my brother in laws dont ever talk to him. And I hear this and I'm like what did you expect. Treat people like that and they're not gonna want anything to do with you. I dont want anything to do with him but everytime I see him he complains that no one talks to him. It makes me avoid him more. It just frustrates me so much.

ftrbk0,what should I do?,"my parents can be very hard on me  and sometimes it can get very physically. the first incident I clearly remember is from 6 years ago, I was 8 at the time and my English wasn't very good, as I am brought up in a Chinese household, my mum decided to buy these comprehension books for me to do but I didn't want to do them, so I got my brother to. when my mum found out she was furious and made me stand on one leg for 3ish hours (9-12pm)  and told me to wait for my dad to come home, when he did he hit me with a golf stick continuously for hours on end. I still have scars on my thighs and back which haven't faded completely. there has been lots of incidents like this but things got better as I got older....or so I thought. we have a close family friend and I would tell her anything, I would always come crying to her whenever something happened. she has never told me to call childline as she sees my mum as a daughter. she would just listen and tell my mum not to do it but obviously she doesn't listen. My mum is a very complicated person, I don't know whether to feel bad for her or just hatred. she is in somewhat of a abusive relationship with my father, in our family we are taught to respect males of the household and just do what others say quietly. I have caught my dad hitting and chocking my mum several time, I didn't do anything and it kills me that I cant, I want to but I don't know what to do. she would come crying to me and I would try to comfort her but then I think back to all the horrible things she has said and done. I know that I am petty for thinking like that. my parents have started to be less physical and more verbal. I remember it was the first day back to high school (I was in yr 9) and I wore a little make. my mum asked me if I was wearing makeup and I said yes. then she got really angry and called me dad down. he grabbed my head and pushed it against a wall and said something along the lines of ""sluts wear makeup"". I made me take it off and told me never to wear it. I am 14 now and nothing a lot has changed for the worse e.g. I have my period now and they treat it as some kind of taboo, I left a pad on my desk once and my dad got furious and said ""ru trying to curse the whole family by putting that disgusting and unhygienece thing on  the table"" they think of my period as a curse! I sounds funny but then they start avoiding me everytime I have it, they same think happens to my mum too. another example is I have very bad acne and I have tried to get rid of it, I would expect stupid class mates to make fun of me but not my parents. they would cautiously laugh at me and call me a clown. my self esteem was already low to begin with now its almost non existant. not to mention how they make fun of my body. they would call me fat, I would then diet and try to only consume 1200 calories per day, but that didn't make them happy either they would say if im going to diet, don't eat anything so I could starve to death. at this point I could care less. this is only a few things things that have happened and it honestly makes me sad. I don't know what I feel, sometimes I would cry and wonder what have I done wrong. I work hard at school and I always get above 85%. I keep my room tidy. im on grade 7 piano. I am on the school hockey team. like what else do they want. I know im not amazing but I really do try. sometimes I wonder should I even care. what's the point of caring.

I'm just looking for advice because i want to move out but i'm only 14, so its not really a sensible idea but i don't think i can live with them for another 4 years.

Slowly I've just turned everything I loved into something I hate and I can't stand to love something for long, incase it hurts me like they did. And I think because of all that trauma, I'm becoming them.

I'm becoming violent, hateful and overall abusive and I don't know what to do. I've been having really bad days and I'm hurting people I know because of it. I just keep yelling and telling them mean things like my abusers did to me.

fttar3,Only understanding the affect of my abuse/ trauma at 20 years old.,"I just turned 20, and I’m only now starting to piece together and understand the results of my abuse and trauma. 

I was sexually abused regularly by my father from the age of 3 until I was 15. I was also sexually abused a handful of times and raped once by my older brother. I’ve struggled throughout my life with depression, PTSD and anxiety. At 15, I opened up to my mother about what had been happening from my father, and she asked him to move out while I figured out what my next step was going to be (I was completely against going to the police just yet, much to my mothers dismay). My father ended up doing a load of drugs and drinking and tied me and my 2 siblings up and was going to/ threatening to kill us. The police showed up and he ended up being shot.

Nearly 5 years on, I’m in a loving, happy relationship and have a baby on the way. I’ve slowly been coming to terms with the trauma I’ve suffered, and have very efficient coping mechanisms for day to day life. It’s like because I’m starting a new chapter, my brain is trying to sort out and process the previous chapters of my life. I frequently experience flashbacks that are very vivid and intense. I have issues around sex, in the sense that I have a very high libido and if my partner isn’t in the mood I feel absolutely worthless and like I have no purpose anymore. I now understand this probably stems from being rewarded for sexual acts from an incredibly young age, and that being all I’ve known. Being pregnant, I feel as though I’ve lost my sex appeal and now have no use to my boyfriend. I know this is absolutely insane and he tells me so himself, but it’s hard wired into my brain.

I’m still in education and I’ve never really given myself time to sit and process everything I’ve been through. I had exams to do straight after my father died and just carried on with education from there so I never received any real therapy. Once my son is born, I’m going to be spending a lot of time at home and I feel as though I am finally ready to get some help. This is especially true now I’m starting to understand why I behave in certain ways, so I know what to ask for help with. I want to be the best mother I can be, so I don’t know whether it best to wait a few years until baby is older or to start now as I feel ready to. Regardless, I feel as though the mess of thoughts going round in my head is slightly more organised and I feel a slight sense of peace. I think I’m finally ready to confront my past.",sarah_jayne69,2020-04-02 12:58:07,8,497,36.57,15.71,99,7.3,21.61,14.29,93.96,59.96,17.3,14.49,13.28,0.2,0,1.01,0,2.82,4.43,16.3,10.87,8.05,9.05,1.21,20.12,4.63,2.41,1.01,1.81,1.81,6.24,2.21,3.82,0.6,1.61,0.8,6.24,2.62,0.4,0.8,2.21,10.87,3.82,1.21,0.6,1.81,2.01,2.01,2.82,0.6,0,1.81,3.42,0.6,1.21,1.61,0.2,6.64,2.01,1.41,3.82,0.8,0.2,5.03,13.08,1.21,17.51,2.41,5.63,9.86,1.01,0.2,0.2,0.2,0,0.4,0.4,0,0,0.4,0,0,12.47,4.63,3.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.62,0.4,0.4

ftx42k,Was I sexually assaulted/abused/molested?,"So I asked this earlier, but it was early in the morning because I couldn’t sleep, so I’m going to try a better time where hopefully there are more active people. I got replies on the other one and I am thankful for their support, but I like to get many peoples opinions. Like a consensus.

Ok so one of my biggest problems is the doubt I have about the abuse. I don’t know if what happened constitutes assault and I have been having doubts about it. So I am asking for the opinion of people on this subreddit because it just is really bothering me.

So when I was 12 I was at my uncles cottage and I was in the lake with the neighbour’s kid who was ~3-4 years older than me I think, and we were play fighting kind of. He brought us to a place in the lake that was covered by trees so no one could see us, and he pulled me towards him and wrapped his legs around mine and held them closed. He was holding my wrists before he reached down and started touching/grabbing me through my swim trunks which were just soccer shorts. I don’t know how many times he touched me, it may have only been once I don’t remember. I was trying to escape and I was saying stop. It didn’t last very long I don’t think and he didn’t really do anything but touch and grab me. Does that count as sexual assault? I don’t know anymore. It’s just really overwhelming. I hate feeling the doubt along with the pain. It makes it so much worse.",Daniel_128,2020-04-02 16:31:49,1,284,6.74,18.94,76.59,1.98,15.78,15.49,93.66,62.68,22.54,16.2,11.62,1.06,0,2.82,0.7,6.34,4.58,9.86,13.03,8.1,9.51,3.17,22.54,4.23,3.52,2.11,2.46,1.41,8.45,2.82,5.63,1.41,2.82,0.35,8.8,0.35,0.35,0,3.17,12.32,2.46,1.41,1.76,3.87,0,3.87,3.17,0.35,0.35,2.46,2.11,1.06,0.35,0.7,0,7.39,1.06,1.06,2.11,1.06,2.46,8.45,10.21,1.06,11.97,1.76,5.28,4.93,0,1.06,0.35,0,0,0,0.35,0,0,0.35,0,0,14.08,5.63,2.11,0,0,0.7,0,0.35,0,3.87,0,1.41

ftxw15,"Understanding that I’m being abused. (TW// Sexual, Physical, and Verbal abuse)","Hi all! I hope you all are safe during this pandemic. I’m new to this sub, because it’s taken me a really long time to cope with the abuse that my dad has done to me. I would just like to vent about it since it honestly kinda helps? Idk. Maybe I’m just being dramatic. But anyway, the abuse all kind of started when I was pretty young. He would say bad things about my weight, my hair, and my behavior because he had a problem with my mom, and he’d use me as a scapegoat to argue with my mom. He even got mad at me for getting my period at an early age. (sorry, I know that’s TMI.) He would also contradict himself. On one visit when I was 10, he told me that I wasn’t allowed to go outside, so I played video games and used the internet for the day. When he came home, he literally yelled at me for not going outside and exercising. He would also call me fat when I was growing up, and he didn’t want me to have any academic interests. Every time I would try to talk, he would make the whole conversation about himself, and I could never talk about my interests with him. As for the physical abuse, it was pretty limited since I only saw him a few times a year. The first time it happened, he dragged me up a flight of stairs and threw me into my temporary room, and the second time it happened, he tried to slap me in my mom’s car. I dodged it, though, and my mom and I quickly got out. I think there were more incidents, but I have issues remembering some of the things he did to me. The sexual abuse is honestly what got to me the most, since he continues to gaslight me about it. He would always feel up against my legs, comment on my body, pull down his pants to show me his ass, and just be weird to me in general. The most distinct thing I could remember is when he got on top of me and started grinding against me and kissing my neck when I was around 8-9.

ftyexr,Help! I'm stuck with girlfriend and she is ignoring safety rules regarding groceries?,"My girlfriend has recently moved in with me from her year abroad and now I think I regret I accepted. 

I'm not sure if I'm exaggerating but I am washing my hands many times and try to take all the necessary precautionary methods to prevent being infected with covid-19. Today, however I told her to wash her hands again because she touched a plastic container I din't clean yet then touched a knife to open it. So she went to wash them superficially with water only, and I told her to use soap. At that moment she got completely out of her mind and started touching everything around historically and then came to me to touch me on my t-shirt and hands with her own palms. 

That drove me utterly insane, and to my shame I lost my temper as well and told her that she is f\*\*\* crazy and to leave me alone or I'll call the police. She kept touching me and surfaces around the kitchen and I got so pissed I broke a wooden puppet we had in the kitchen by smashing it to the floor. Then I told her to f\*\*\* off and get out of the flat and accused her of terrorism (I know I was stupid as well). I'm struggling with depression and anixety as well  some OCD behaviours due to the pandemic (but I have never been diagnosed with it). I also have dyslexia and I'm always frustrated I'm slow reader when I need so much information.

ftztow,Told bf about my rape and now he barely talks to me,"(Posted on two subs bc I wasn't sure which is more fitted) 

About a year and a half ago, I was raped. I had just started dating my boyfriend, and I hid my abuse for several months before finally telling him. He was nothing but supportive, kind, and comforting. Although I gave him very few details and played it off, bc that's how I deal with things. I'm an extremely private person in real life and I repressed so many of my emotions to deal with it. Distracting myself, working super hard etc. That all worked until I had to self quarantine (not with bf either) and I've had ample time to stew about it and boy, it's caught up with me. 
Anyway, spare you the details but I was having such a bad time a few days ago and I called him, and ended up sobbing and being veryy vulnerable with how I'm feeling. And he helped me and was sweet. 
But then the day after that and all this time, he's been so...withdrawn. Barely talking to me. Leaving me on read constantly.
And I want to play it off. But I can't because it's such a sensitive thing for me. It feels like I scared him off. Im not going to even go into all the emotions I feel if that's the case...but I feel so heartbroken. And broken in general that he's pulled away because of it. 
Is it me? Or is it him, or us? Or this damn quarantine? I don't even know what to think.

Also you can see from my last post that we're kinda going through it.

fu2tl3,23 year old male.,"My older ""brother"" by 5 years.

When he was 2/3 his babysitter of 6-10 months. (I wasn't born yet, don't now for sure)
He would get dropped off at her house before work (she was a professional babysitter in the neighborhood) and play games like monopoly, chutes and ladders, whatever the fuck they had for a few hours until her kids came home and then apparently (my parents didn't know until the end) lock him in a closet until parents showed up, ""so she could focus on her own kids)

I was born when my brother was about five.
At three(my age) he told me he always hated me because people loved me more than they loved him. I felt sorry for him. He'd get into an argument with my parents(a lot, he's troubled, it's okay) and I'd just tune it out and play with my toys. He'd see me smile and point and shout ""he hates me, see? He's smiling because I'm in trouble."" It happened a lot but I forgive him, because I figured it was an honest mistake.

We moved into a new house. The ceiling in the living room went up to the second floor and there was a banister so if you sat on the landing no one could see you. In this house, my brother at some point decided that it would be fun to chase me around trying to shove a turkey baster or some days a spatula or it's handle up my ass. I was ten-twelve. When this was happening. 

I'm this house, I was twelve and I started to have a crush on my friends older sister at church. She was a year older. Thirteen. My brother was seventeen, at least. At least, I tell myself I was twelve and seventeen. I try not to think about what our ages were too hard. I flirted with this girl as best I could for two months and confided in h asking for advice a month in. On month three I ""confessed"" my feelings to her and she said she liked me too, but My brother had been hooking up with him in the church stairwell for two months. 

One day my brother was sitting on his skateboard in his room and asked me to sit in front of him. I did. He was my big brother and was never nice to me, so it was supposed to be a golden opportunity. He pulled me close and started rocking the skateboard back and forth. I had just learned what being gay was so when he started to grab me, I asked if he was gay. He threw me of the skateboard while yelling at me about how awful I was, if anyone was gay, it was etc, etc. My parents intervened and ended up scolding me because ""being gay means you're going to hell, so I shouldn't ever call someone that, let alone brother. I said I was sorry. It was my fault and I didn't understand.

Later on he would end up getting into a fight with my parents and try to kick my dad down the stairs, leading to my mom tackling him and holding him down while he shouted ""I'm not the devil, I'm not the devil."" I ended it by running outside and shouting where the neighbors can hear "" make sure he doesn't hurt himself!"" On repeat. Nothing shits down abuse like the neighbors hearing.

One day there were people from church over and my friend Abby was there. My mom had closed my room because it was a mess and didn't want anyone to see it, Abby said she didn't mind and mom relented. My brother walks by and says something at my expense and I hit him back with an insult, so he spent 45 minutes bending me into a pretzel, showing off to Abby. An 11 year old girl. Turning, ""see? You can't even beat me in front of your girlfriend."" I didn't want him to feel like he one so I just stayed there being bent and twisted and hurting for nearly an hour. He manged to shove my legs behind my head and twisted my arms nearly out of socket. I was pissed and flexible and just kept shitting on him withy words. ""Oh the 6'0 ft tall big man can hurt a kid who can't even ride the big boy roller coaster, ooh, what maaAANnn."" He kept swearing and spitting in face quiet enough so Abby couldn't hear. I relented because she was only gonna be there for another 20 minutes, not before running back over, calling him an idiot and slapping the back of his head. (Still proud of that.) He almost broke my bedroom door of his hinges. I got scolded because I closed the door on his hand once he forced it open, saying what he was going to do to me.



Over the next 2 or 3 years O don't remember much of anything, except thatI slept with a kitchen knife under my pillow, when I slept.

I took on the responsibility of making sure he didn't fuck any under aged girls after that until he went to college, because I would watch him try. I eventually confided in my dad and all I got was a disappointed look and a ""damn. We've been worried about him with little girls."" After he dropped out, they still let him become the assistant youth pastor.

I had to move back home after a stalker almost ha me shot in the city and harrased me at work so much that I couldn't keep the job and couldn't pay rent. 

He tried to drug and rape me. One night he may have succeeded. I drank to q blackout after so I could forget the signs.

Another ""friend"" decided after an acid trip that I was ""put on earth to fulfill his dreams."" He didn't get fired because his sister in law owned the bar.

Multiple men have just walked up to me and just said ""I want to rape you.""

Now I'm in my parents house a year after he moved his wife and himself in with them because ""he doesn't want to leave his 11-12$ an hour job at six flags yet, because it will look good on his resume.""

Just last month my parents left the room and his wife was sitting on the floor playing with a kitten I helped it's mother give birth to and rescued. He walked up behind her and started dry-humping the back of her head with a stupid glazed look on his face. 

There's so much more I was just dealing with memories and need to get them out. 

I've been imagining killing him for years. I know how I'd do it. I know more than ten feasible ways, but it isn't worth looking over my back for the rest of my life. He's not stopped being a piece of shit. He complains about how hard life is for him because he can't make enough money and then drops over a grand d a month on video games and trading cards. He doesn't do anything but mooch of his wife and my parents. 

I just want to piss him off enough so it's self-defense. I've been practicing every self-defense technique I could watch, reqd about or learn from fighters I know since I was twelve. 

I just want to leave.

I almost have enough money.

When he does pass, I'm going to go up to the podium and share this. 

I just want him in hell, put back in his child's body getting raped the way he has others and put back in that cold sad closet. 

He deserves it and worse.

For now, I smile, ignore him and pretend everything is okay until I get on with everything.",throwawayerite,2020-04-02 22:52:37,1,1328,34.76,53.01,62.84,6.97,16.4,12.5,93.22,58.58,20.56,16.94,9.11,0.23,0.45,6.78,0.38,3.61,5.05,13.86,8.96,5.72,7.91,2.18,19.28,3.77,1.88,1.2,2.79,1.51,5.72,2.03,3.69,0.08,1.81,0.68,14.68,2.11,0.53,1.96,6.93,9.94,1.66,1.58,1.88,2.33,0.83,2.41,3.24,1.05,1.13,0.98,2.79,1.36,0.3,0.75,0.23,7.91,3.24,1.13,2.33,1.13,0.6,7.98,8.21,0.75,18.45,2.41,9.56,7.23,1.36,1.28,1.66,0.68,0.68,0.08,1.36,0.9,0.23,0.15,0.08,0,16.19,5.87,3.16,0,0,0.15,0.08,0.45,1.96,3.39,0.98,0.15
fu3bei,was I abused??,"it's been on my mind a lot recently and I figure this is the best/easiest place to ask (at least anonymously)

&amp;#x200B;

It boils down to basically that, with a previous partner (about 2.5 years ago), I had pretty much always felt pressured into sex. She would always act annoyed and frustrated with me whenever I wasn't in the mood so I guess I decided it was just easier to avoid that confrontaion go along with it. The problem is that of course I never told her this and this is where most of my conflict about it stems, does it really count if I would just go along with it and never said no? I still don't know if she would've done anything if I'd've just been honest and said I wasn't in the mood. But essentially at this point I'm almost entirely afraid of sex. I guess I just want opinions about it, it's been bothering me a lot recently for some reason, and i don't want to be exaggerating it to myself. apologies if it's not a good explanation, but i've only really spoken to 1 or 2 people about this before",throw07670677832310,2020-04-02 23:34:39,4,200,11.86,7.37,74.76,8.08,25,12,94,65,22,12,10.5,0,0,1.5,0,10,4,14,12,10,7.5,4,19,5,4,1,1.5,3.5,8.5,3,4.5,1.5,2.5,0,6,0,0.5,1.5,0,19,3,0.5,5,7,2.5,6,2,0,1.5,0.5,1.5,0,0,1,0,3.5,0.5,0.5,1.5,1,1,9.5,10,0,12,1,5,6,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.5,2.5,3,0,1,1.5,0,0,0,6,2,1.5
fu3rv4,Sometimes I get flashbacks to all the terrible things that happened,"My brother probably abused me so badly but I didn’t notice because it was what I thought was “normal”. We don’t talk anymore. So far he’s threatened to kill my husband (who calls him out on his bullshit) and he ignores me. Lately I just remember him guilting me into doing shit for him or just being a rude prick or whatever. I remember things he said...He used to pickpocket me to “teach me a lesson” and invaded my privacy. He used to barge in while I was changing just because. Or he’d barge into the bathroom while I was showering. He’d order me to do the cleaning since he cooked and tell me to clean when I cook because a chef needs to clean their kitchen. He’d also make me help him cook. He’d get upset when I’d spend time with friends or doing my hobbies. He yelled at me once for not answering my phone during my music lessons. I’ve had to adjust my birthday plans for him. He once threw his credit card at me for asking if he was using it to buy groceries (My dad paid for his credit card) because my dad couldn’t keep up with payments. He told me to not cry because crying does nothing. I literally had 5 panic attacks from him. He threatened to take my dogs away for something I didn’t even do. He used to tell me “Tough Tits” as his personal way to tell me to deal with it. Between the craziness and pressure from my parents and him, I ended up in the hospital. I’m in a better place (relatively) now but lately these Flashbacks bring up the anxiety again. I haven’t listed all the abuse because frankly I’m not ready. But yeah. I hate going through this and the worse part is wondering if it’s actually abuse because no one called him out on it until I met my husband. And for like 19 years of my life, there’s so much shit that happened that sometimes it freaks me out to go back through it.

fu3vx3,I(f15) recently found out that my online friend (m16) is being physically and emotionally abused by his mother,"I only met this guy a month or two online and we mainly communicate through snapchat. Last night we had a reasonably deep conversation and he told me that he ‘gets beat’. I asked him who did it to him and he said it was his mother because she ‘despises’ him and his father, and says his parents still live together despite it being ‘the most toxic relationship’ he’s ever seen. I hadn’t heard from him in a while, around 16 or 17 hours which was out of the ordinary behaviour for him and he finally reached out to me a few hours ago saying that his parents have taken his phone trying but he is trying to stay in contact with me. I asked him if he was okay and he showed me a video of his arm which was visibly red and was laced with darker red cut and scratch marks. I asked him who did it, he said his mother. I suggested he take photos of his cuts and bruising as proof of what’s happening and he said he had already done so. I asked if he had told anyone about this and he says he has a therapist but has not yet told her. I am trying my best to emotionally support and reassure him that it isn’t his fault and he seems very appreciative of my help.

fu51zv,How do I tell my parents I don't want to get married anymore?,"I've realized my boyfriend does multiple abuse tactics on me. 

Gaslighting: telling me it's my fault if he yells, breaks things or hurts me in some way.

Does not communicate: Anytime I ask him a question he gets defensive and says things like ""do you just hate my family?"" When I ask anything about his mom.

He yells at me when I have panic attacks or when I can't do something because of my disability. I ended up on the floor (I don't remember how) and he yelled at me to get over to the couch and he forced me to ""crab walk"" backwards and when I couldn't go as fast as he wanted he accused me of doing it on purpose (I have a metal prosthetic). After he calmed down I showed him that my leg didn't really allow me to do what he wanted and he apologized, but he continues to do things similar. 

I tried telling my mom that I didn't want to get married, I even tried to get him mad in front of my parents so they could see what he does. I'm scared they'll be disappointed, I'm scared he'll hurt himself if I leave and I don't like to make people sad or upset.",throwawayformevha,2020-04-03 02:08:22,5,223,4.12,26.51,62.25,1,22.3,14.8,95.96,63.68,30.04,24.66,15.7,0,0.45,7.62,0.9,5.38,1.79,12.11,10.76,4.93,9.87,3.59,24.66,4.04,2.24,3.59,0,0.9,8.07,0.45,7.62,1.79,3.14,1.79,17.49,3.14,0.45,0.9,8.52,13.9,1.35,3.14,3.59,4.48,0,4.93,3.59,0.9,1.79,0.9,0.45,0.45,0,0,0,10.31,3.14,1.35,3.14,2.24,0.45,4.93,17.49,0.9,12.11,2.24,6.28,4.48,0,0.45,0.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.04,3.59,1.79,0.9,0,0.9,0,0,1.79,6.28,1.79,0
fu562m,I just realised how fucked up I was as a kid.," Having a lot of time to think I remembered something I did as a kid, that I always found strange and was embarrassed about. Now that I started therapy a while back, my way of seeing things changed and I took a second look, just to realise that it was some sort of coping mechanism.

It’s hard to share, but let me fill you in. Maybe you can learn something, but at least I can get it off my chest.

My older cousin used to ""shoot me"" so I was ""dead"" and ""couldn’t move"" every time he played with me. He would then undress me and rub my clitoris. It started when I was still in kindergarten.

So, I was young and had no idea what was going on. I started to rub my clitoris against the corner of tables, fully clothed fyi. And I did this everywhere and so much that the skin got irritated often and my mother had to apply a salve. We called that behaviour ""riding"". What nobody knew was what I was thinking about while doing it. I knew nothing about sex or porn, but I knew fairy tales. I imagined Hansel and Gretel, but this time Gretel would lose, and the witch eats them. Or another time my older cousins played a south park video game where when you answered wrong a spinning drill would be inserted in the ass of your character. I immediately started to ""ride"" the table in the room looking at that.

Growing up I knew that all this is messed up, but I was too scared to look at it in too much detail. Now I think that the games my cousin played with me shaped my way of seeing sexuality. I had to die so he could touch me and so I made the association of violence and death with sex. I always convinced myself that what he did had no effect on me, or that I must have even liked it. But that’s just not true.

The thing that confused me the most (in hindsight) was the hentai and bdsm culture that was accessible through the internet when I started masturbating and figuring stuff out. I didn't think of it as odd that I needed people to get hurt in order to get turned on, because it was just another category like many others on these websites.

When I started to have sex, my mind was already made up. I would be the sub searching for someone to dominate me. I also knew that I didn't want to be treated like that outside the context of sex and found a wonderful partner who I am with until this day who checks all the marks.

So yeah, that’s my story. Thanks for reading, and just fyi this is a throw away account for many, I believe obvious, reasons.",10_min_confession,2020-04-03 02:17:34,3,491,21.12,17.96,94.41,14.52,16.93,13.85,93.28,62.73,23.01,13.24,11.2,0.2,0.81,0.81,0.2,9.78,5.09,12.83,9.37,6.92,9.16,1.63,20.16,2.85,1.83,2.44,0.2,2.65,4.07,1.63,2.44,0.81,0.41,0.41,5.91,0.81,0.2,0.41,0.81,14.46,4.48,1.63,2.04,2.65,2.04,2.85,2.65,1.43,0,1.22,3.26,1.02,0.2,2.24,0.2,5.09,1.83,0.41,1.63,1.22,0.41,10.59,7.13,0.41,14.87,1.83,6.72,6.31,0.61,1.22,0.2,0.2,0,0.61,1.02,0.41,0,0.2,0,0,13.24,5.91,3.67,0,0,0,0,0,2.04,1.22,0.41,0

fu5ea9,I do not know how to live properly.,"I (19F) have no clue who to tell this to. I could never bring it up to my friends. My family is what they are and that’s all. I’m gonna organize it the best way I can. 

My parents had me at the exact age I am now. My father be wanted an abortion. My mother agreed. The tires popped on the way there and she took it as a sign to keep me. So he left. He has made several unsteady appearances and apologies. That issue doesn’t bother me anymore. I have forgiven him. He’s who he is. 

My great grandmother assisted my mother in caring for me until I was about 2. Then she returned home. 

After that my mother began to sell me. Mostly to men. Most were close to our family. I can’t remember much of that. Just lots of screaming and crying. 

One of the worst was when I was about 3-4. She sold me to the men down the street for money and drugs. Little did she know my great grandparents were in town and looking for us. They came to find her alone. After a few hours her guilt set in and my grandparents couldn’t contain themselves. They began to throw her around the room. Screaming in her face until she gave up and told them where I was. They came alone. No cops. They found me in a locked closet. Silently sitting in the dark on the floor. From what I remember that’s where they kept me until I had to do things. They took me home. My great grandparents couldn’t stay long. And they all made it so I would continue to be in my mothers custody. While we lived with my mothers father and his wife. (Which is where we had been staying most of the time anyway.)

I was not only used by my mother. Her mother used me as well. (Her paternal mother not her fathers wife) Me and my grandmother were close during my childhood. I understand now why. She would pick me and my mother. Drive us to her husbands property in the woods. My mother would seemingly disappear most of the time we were there. And the most I can remember is sitting in front of the tv clicking channels back and forth. And I would mysteriously pass out. I would wake up completely naked between my grandmother and her husband. Sometimes doing things, most times being used. These visits continued until we moved. 

While being in the care of my grandfather and his wife, my mother would rarely be there. She would stay a few days here and there. A week at most. But never for long. 

In that house was not only my grandparents but their only child. A son. He wasn’t much older than me. About 5 years or so. They had him after he left my paternal grandmother. He was/is a very large person. At the times we lived together he remained 100+lbs and many feet bigger than me. He hated me. And torturing me was fun for him. Especially since he got away with it. He would make me watch porn with him constantly. And talk me into doing things or he would tell my grandpa. He would put tacks outside my door on the carpet. When I learned to jump over a certain radius, he extended to radius. Which I then learned to wear shoes inside the house. He physically abused me any chance he got. And nearly came close to killing me several times due to our size difference. From what I do remember, I was in a lot of pain and became extremely hopeless. 

He was not the worst in the house. His mother, my grandpas wife, was the one. She was/is a small large woman. She would lock me in my room for days on end. They taped my windows shut. And nailed my door shut from the outside. Often using rope and wire. She would leave me in there for days at a time. She would either not feed me or force feed me until I was sick enough to throw up and eat again. Then my great grandparents came for another visit. They had found out what she had done and forced her to open the door. They found me barely conscious. The floor and mattress stained with feces and puke. No sheets. No blankets. No food. No water. Nothing. My hair was matted and I had given myself several injuries. I assume this is where my habit of self harm first formed. They cleaned me and everything else. And sadly, they left me with them again. My memory of this stage is one of the real bad ones. I remember crying a lot. And my nails bleeding from trying to open the windows. I didn’t understand much. I was so hungry. I missed my mother and I wanted to go outside. 

My mother would occasionally take me with her. Which included places like homeless shelters and trap houses. I was still sold to several men and women. Be traded for a night of food and shelter, a hit, or a ride. But I preferred it to being with my grandparents. Most of my memories from this time include lots of walking. Lots of darkness, music, drugs, crowded room, naked people, gunshots, and pain. I remember thinking that if I was good enough to my abusers, mother would keep me another day. That if I was obedient, they wouldn’t hurt me as bad. That if I could just keep going, she’d come back for me. Physically I was in shambles. Mentally I was nothing. Emotionally, I was destroyed. 

And then there were visits with my father. Not many. But enough that I can’t forget. He would pick me up. They would have me ready and everything look like I was being treated fair. He would hit me when he got mad or thought I was lying. Which was often. He used to pull my pants down in front of his friends. He never did anything real bad, his brother did. His brother, my uncle, is was/is mentally ill. I would often be left with him. He would rape me and whatnot and cover his tracks. And if not, my fathers family would. They believed that since he was ill, he couldn’t be blamed. 

My mother had her own place a couple times. They never lasted long. The most I remember is drugs, crying, knifes, burning, and weird sexual stuff. 

Time in-between all of this was spent with family with substance problems and people I’ll probably never meet again. As far as school goes, it was deemed too risky. As I could say something that could destroy everyone. 

All of this continued until I was about 7-8. My mother had my sister, gave her away. And another sister, gave her away. And my brother, which she kept. Things were closing in so my mother decided to move to my great grandparents. Over 1,000 miles away. 


We all (9) lived in one house until my mother got her own. Almost every night there was abuse, a drunken fight, and enough damage to convince you it was a dump. 

She would get horribly drunk every night. And cried her eyes out while throwing up or destroying things. I would calm her and put her to bed so I could clean. I would beg my family to take me but they left me on purpose so somebody would keep my brother alive. She would then continue to have 5 more kids over a 10 year period. 

I eventually began to live a normal life. My cycle was to go to school, come home, cook &amp; clean everything. Make sure we still had a house. Make sure my mom was alive. Make sure the kids were alive and taken care of. Continue until morning. And repeat. Excluding all the things I did but don’t want to list because it’d take a lot. 


Yeah there was hitting and lots of emotional abuse but it was better than before. Especially since I went to school. 

I was bright. Intelligent. As long as I could do it alone. And then the human part came in. Publicly acceptable forms of behavior. Speaking to an adult, and other kids. My understanding of everything was assembled from so much damage. I would act out. Although my grades were great my behavior was a nightmare. I was disrespectful, physical, aggressive, and disobedient. I was a danger to not only other students, but the teachers. I had to take counseling at school but that was about all. The other kids were convinced I was crazy. And as such treated me as I wasn’t there. I became a huge bully in attempt to get attention. Seeing as when other children did it to me, it was popular. I eventually made friends with older kids. And kids with substance abuse problems. I began drinking/ using at age 10. This continued into middle school. 

Middle school was when the self harm and substance abuse really kicked it. My bully habit became extinguished as I became bullied myself. I was cutting myself everywhere and using/ getting drunk weekly. Still seeing to it that I took care of my siblings. (Don’t ask where I got the money.) It never once occurred to me that things that happened to me, weren’t my fault. That I deserved to be treated like human. Whatever that means. My friends were often changing because of the way I was while I used. I was “still crazy” but a very popular form of “will do anything” crazy. 


I kept my home life and school life mostly separate. Besides the write ups, tardiness, phone calls and whatnot. My school nor mother discovered any of my personal activity until I was about 13. 


That was when I first attempted suicide. My family was enraged I had done something so selfish and attention seeking. I was in the psych ward for a week or so. And per usual, I lied my ass off to get out. Only to return to my family dysfunction, bullying, and substance issues. 

6 or so more suicide attempts, many nights of being raped by random dudes while I was passed out, and losing more siblings to the law, I was in high school. 


Dating a senior as a freshman. Getting drunk at his place. Getting taken advantage of every time. Making the wrong friends. Selling drugs. Setting fires. Getting in fights. 

Things changed up a bit when my mother got a job. I would stay up for days at a time. Taking care of the kids while she was at work. Getting paid in dope and money. Getting drunk and sobering up enough in time for school. Lying to anybody who could possibly help me. 

Eventually I dropped out because I couldn’t keep up the schedule. And I’ve been doing the same since. 

Yes there is more problems, more drugs, more harm, more feelings. I was/am lost. I am simply doing what I can to hold onto whoever I am. I am getting sober slowly. I am getting closer to my siblings. I am discovering affection and honesty. I am discovering religion and love. I am working on being more than whatever that was. I am learning how to be alive. I don’t want pity. I don’t want accusations. I want to let some of it the fuck out for once in my life without having to say it aloud. 


I have known pain, worthlessness, hopelessness, whatever you want to call it. And I now know that it was worth it. Every day, every minute, every little second. And I am grateful.

fu6evo,Grandma: abusive/compulsive liar,"Hey, I'm a 24 yr old F, and I'm in the middle of searching for a therapist, but until then, here I go.  My grandmother is half French, half Mexican, but she looks French.

However, my grandfather is Mexican so I think maybe she liked him because, well who knows.    Anyways, they had two kids together; my mom and her brother.   My mom came out looking more Mexican, while my uncle was white with blue eyes.   My grandma was very abusive towards my mother, and my mom told me she knew it was because she looked Mexican.  My mother would often get beat for no reason at all, very badly.  So badly that she had a dislocated disc in her back and my grandma had to take her to the doctors.   When my mom told me all of this, I felt disgusted, like I wanted to hurt my grandma &amp; I could care less if she went to hell honestly.   My mother also was in an abusive relationship for a long time, and when I asked her if she let him hit her because grandma showed her abuse was okay, she broke down crying.

fu7bjx,My ex left me for someone else and i don't know what to do.,"TRIGGER WARNING contains mentions of suicide, mental health and abuse.

TL;DR My ex (F25) is in a new realtionship with a guy she told me (M25) not to worry about when we were breaking up.

  I don't want to make this a huge post but i need some advice. My ex left me around 6 months ago after our relationship broke down due to poor communication and co-dependency issues, it also came at a time when she was going through a traumatic experience as her emotionally abusive ex had just passed away and it was particularly hard as he was still involved in her brothers freindship group. She suffered from poor mental health and I'd like to think i was always there for her, including a trip to hospital when she attempted to take her own life, an event thats left me with a large amount of trauma.

  A part of the break up involved me being suspicious of her close male freind from her drama course. She was spending alot of time with him when i was away for work on the weekends, spoke about him alot and was always very close to him in pictures. We lived together for a year before this happened and i was suffering with my mental health and low self esteem which only exacerbated the problem. We spoke about it multiple times and it always got to the point where i was accused of having trust issues and that they were just very close freinds. 

  As the relationship broke down she distanced herself from me in increasing amounts. I went to see my doctor to talk about my mental health for the first time ever and when i got back from work that night i was told she was staying at his house with freinds to watch TV and it was too late for her to get home. She moved out and sofa surfed (at various freinds houses including the guy in question) as I was looking for a place to move out to as she was going to stay on at our place. She also took him to see a show that her mum had bought tickets for us both to see as a Christmas present. I picked up some stuff from the flat a few weeks after i had moved out and some of his clothes were there. At every step i confronted her about these things but was always told "" he's just a freind"" ""i slept on the sofa"" ""he's not well"" ""it's all in your head"". She also made lots of various points about having not been single since she was 16 and that she needed time to be alone, so another relationship was not on the cards for her.

  We broke off contact after i moved out and at various points he cropped up in photos with her close freinds and at different events and now I've found out they are together. It's hurt me but I'm lucky enough that I've started the process of moving on and it hasn't floored me as I've had a long time to come to terms with it and it was always something that i believed deep down as i trust my instincts.

fum6in,the aftermath of sexual assault and emotional abuse,"just speaking out loud. when i(19f) was 18, i was sexually assaulted. the full thing, i just dont like saying the word. i didnt press charges or tell my parents and barely anyone knows. i was very drunk and my mind blocks most of it out so i can describe most of it easily to the people i open up to. i feel shitty that it doesn’t affect me that much. the people that i open up know im not lying, but i feel like its strange to others and off putting that i can be so candid about it. 

also i have a friend that lost her virginity to a hookup. it was consentual but he was very suggestive and she wasn’t completely ready (realizing that afterwards). she talks to me now that she doesnt feel pleasure during sex and its because of the trauma she faced. and when she meets boys she tells them shes had a traumatizing history with boys and i think with how she talks they think shes been raped. she doesnt know what happened to me and i have to listen talk about it sometimes and be a good friend without ignoring her. its not hard to be an asshole and say ‘hey look it was consentual, you didn’t have it that bad’. which is ignoring her pain and i would be an asshole to say that but ive experienced it so much worse, but to greet boys and tell them soon after that your history with boys is traumatizing, its very frusterating. 

i was also dumped after an emotionally abusive 3.5yr relationship with my bf a few months before my incident happened. that has affected me more than anything else and all in all, i just feel numb. i cant go out with boys. i have too many memories of being left behind by my bf in social situations, unloyalty, him genuinely not wanting to be with me or care about me etc. i told him a few months after (we still talked a bit after we broke up) that i was getting quite depressed and down and was having suicidal thoughts, to which he responded ‘oh’. i never want to go through that again.

i have fwbs, boys i can cuddle with and boys i do genuinely trust, but i cant do anything else. i tell my fwbs about the incident in case we have drunk sex (the only time i get triggered by it), but even at that i feel like im victimizing myself and looking for attention. my ex messed me up so much that i thought that everything was my fault, im a genuine problem and im extremely hard to love. i get hit on frequently and i could have been in plenty of relationships by now, but i feel numb and cant pursue anything. these have been the hardest months of my life and somehow im still getting through, but hell this is hard. 

within the timeframe of a year, ive left my ex and left all the emotional abuse, but got sexually assaulted and am dealing with the effects of the emotional stuff now that never seem to wear off. its just a lot at once.",eksyl,2020-04-03 20:00:20,3,549,18.12,29.23,79.98,1,19.61,14.03,95.45,63.57,23.32,15.12,10.56,0.55,0.36,3.1,0.55,8.2,4.74,13.11,10.38,6.74,8.2,2.91,20.22,4.01,2.55,1.09,0.55,2.73,6.92,1.28,5.65,0,2.19,0.55,12.39,0.18,0.73,2,2.37,13.66,3.83,1.09,0.91,2.55,1.46,4.55,3.83,0.36,1.09,2.19,2.91,0.73,0.36,1.28,0.36,6.74,2.91,0.18,1.64,1.09,0.91,5.1,14.21,0.18,11.11,0.73,4.55,5.83,0,0.36,0,0,0.18,0.18,1.82,0.73,0.36,0,0.18,0,10.93,4.92,3.28,0,0,0,0,0,0.36,0.91,1.46,0

funfvf,please read if you'd like to share your story!,"hey y'all, I'm shiny new to reddit, but I'm a photographer and journalist wanting to make a difference and thought I may be able to reach people better on here. my goal here is **asking if you'd like to be in my book, or on my blog.** also, if you would like to but want to remain anonymous, that is perfectly fine, and we can definitely do that!

i'm a longtime abuse survivor and i decided a while back that i wanted to share people's stories of abuse with their photographs and make a book out of it. like one of those books you see at barnes &amp; noble that are filled with pretty photos about cooking and all that nonsense, but instead beautiful portraits and people's wrenching but inspiring and honest abuse stories. so a photography collection.

anyhoo, have you heard of Humans of New York? if not, it's a blog where a guy shares strangers' stories and photos online. i live in southern illinois and i started a blog based off of HONY but in my area and all the places i travel. i named this ***Humans of Southern Illinois*** (@ilhumans on insta/fb). please check it out, it'll give you an idea of what this is about.

**i'd just like to ask if anyone would want to be a part of my book**, or if not the book, than the blog. even though you most likely don't live in my area, that's ok, because i interview people wherever i go. i am aware of the quarantine; if you'd want to be interviewed, i'd love to skype you and take your picture while skyping (or you could send pictures)! if you want to be in the book though, i'd love to skype you and then eventually meet you so i can take an actual photograph of you (I'm hoping for the photos for the book to eventually be a photography collection in a gallery someday, or if not, then at least printed and sold at bookstores! maybe even both!)

if you'd like to be in my book, and you'd like to meet up eventually (don't worry--public place--and you can actually get to know me first because i get it that this is a stranger writing this) but you live far from me, i'm always down to travel! this is a deep project worth that expenditure.

also, if you want to be in the book, your story won't be on the same page as your photo, unless you specifically want it to be. this isn't an overnight project, but i'm just wanting to make this photography collection as expansive and beautiful as possible. 

hope you're okay, staying safe, and have a beautiful day. please message me if you're at all interested or have any questions! or if you need someone to talk to. anything, really.

funvhl,"I'm Bad At Titles, Sorry.","Alright, let's jump into this clusterfuck that is my childhood. 

When I was 3 years old, my parents Janet (mother) and Randy (father) got divorced. Because both of them had major drug issues,I went to go live with my grandparents (dad's parents), Cindy and Tom. My parents were in and out of jail. 

Ages 3 through 6, Tom molested me and my cousin. He made it up to be some sort of game, and I, being too young to understand why it was wrong, played into it along with my cousin. The cherry on top was Cindy KNEW what Tom was doing and didn't try to stop him or to tell anyone. 

One day, Tom raped me. This was the first time he put his penis in my vagina and it HURT. I was bleeding so much and I had some internal damage. That's when I decided the 'game' wasn't fun anymore so I told my teacher the next day at school. My teacher called the cops and I was removed from the school to be questioned. It was terrifying for me, I thought I did something wrong. I told him everything Tom did to me and my cousin.

Cindy denied this and said that I made it up, even after my cousin broke down crying and said that Tom did. After Tom passed, she confessed that she knew what he was doing. 

My cousin went to live with his mother and I, with Janet still being in jail, went to foster care. For about a month, I was in foster care (and honestly wished I stayed) until my Aunt (Janet's sister) and her family took me in.

I now lived with Aunt Mindy, Uncle Ollie, Cousin Mikey, Cousin Aiden and Cousin Sam. I had NEVER met these people before (that I could remember, at that point) and I was scared, but I thought that I'd be safe from the abuse Tom put me through.

Boy, was I wrong. 

Ages 7 through 12, Mikey and Aiden raped me repeatedly while Uncle Ollie was at work. Sam just used me as a punching bag. We were all home schooled and Aunt Mindy had no backbone whatsoever, so she ended up never teaching us anything. In fact, we were all a grade behind in school. So they'd spend their days playing XBox and abusing the shit out of me and Aunt Mindy. They'd spit in her face and tell her she was whore, things like that. 

Other kinds of abuse? Lots of that too. Nothing I said was believed by anyone. My cousins forced me to have sex with our male dog and lick his penis. I know what dog semen tastes like. For the longer time, I was terrified of dogs, especially Springer Spaniels, the breed that dog he was. I've had knifes held to my throat, scissors thrown at me, I've had pens and other random objects shoved in my butt. I've had my hair yanked out, huge chunks at a time, I've had laundry detergent forced down my throat. My cousins were constantly telling lies to make me seem like a horrible kid to Uncle Ollie and he believed it. Aunt Mindy was also incredibly emotionally abusive. She'd always tell me that everything that her sons, my cousins, were doing to me were caused by me. She'd say that in order for me to be 'normal', I'd have to let these things happen to me. Also, I was in charge of 80% of the chores in that house. 

When I was 11, Tom passed away. Mindy forced me to go to his funeral. She said and I quote ""It doesn't matter what he did to you! He's still your elder! Show some fucking respect!""

Mindy and Ollie also had a really toxic relationship. She was cheating on him. He'd spit in her face and I'm pretty sure he raped her many times. My upstairs room was right above their room and more than once I heard her crying and asking him to stop with the bed creaking. When I was 12, they finally got a divorce. But the thing, neither Ollie nor Mindy wanted me to live with them. So I went to live with my ""rehabilitated mother"".

Once again, I thought I'd be safe from the abuse. And once again, I was wrong. 

The first thing I told her was about what I went through at Mindy's and Ollie's. She never did anything about it after telling me she'd call the cops and have them arrested.

Janet let 104 different men rape me for money during the 3 years I lived with her in the 'city'. I kept a notebook and made a tally for every different man that raped me. How many times in total they raped me, I don't know. And this isn't all, she was so manipulative, I actually thought it was my fault. She was drunk and that was her excuse. ""I was drunk! I didn't know what was happening!"" But she was drunk 24/7. 

She let me smoke weed, drink alcohol and do heroin. I was 12, 13 and 14 years old, addicted to heroin and alcohol. I'm 3 years clean now but it was a struggle to get clean. 

Then, one of her boyfriends stabbed her and almost killed her. Luckily, I wasn't there when it happened or he might have killed me too. We then moved to a smaller, more county-ish town. That's where Janet met Lisa, the women she married.

Ages 14 through 17, they were married (they still are, the divorce hasn't gone threw yet) and their relationship was so toxic. My mother was still drunk 24/7 (honest, she still is) and was very abusive (emotionally and physically) to Lisa. Lisa, however, brought Janet her beer and whatever she needed. I was kept up by their fighting almost every night in that house. Not to mention, Janet forced me to hang around Mindy and my three cousins on a daily basis. Also, Janet refused to let me see a therapist. 

Wait? Where was my father in all of this, you're wondering? Janet lied to me and told me that Randy didn't want to see me because ""I looked the least like him"" and I was a ""disappointment to him"" so I never talked or reached out to him. She also claimed he was in prison as well. 

At 16 years old, at school, I broke down. A classmate made a rape joke and it triggered my PTSD and I cried and had a panic attack. I went to the school nurse and ended up telling her everything that had happened in my life, beginning with Tom and ending with Janet's and Lisa's last fight. I told her how many times I've tried to commit suicide (14 times) and how I failed everytime. I was sent to a mental hospital. 

That's went I finally found out the truth about my dad. He had been clean of any drug or alcohol and out of jail for 5 YEARS. Janet told Randy that I hated him and I blamed him for Tom raping and molesting me. I moved in with him after the mental hospital released me. 

I'm 17. I have depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, PTSD and insomnia. For the first time, I'm seeing a therapist. For the first time, I'm feeling somewhat hopeful for my future. My 18th birthday will be in July and I can't wait to finally legally changed my name and cut off my mom for good.

fuo9sj,Just to get it off my chest,"Sorry, I’m on mobile. 

I just wanna have somewhere to say this, but my 13 year old son was abused by his mom and stepdad for years. I found out about 6 months ago and I now have full custody. He sleeps with me almost every night, he just clings to me as tight as he can. When he falls asleep I always leave the room and cry. It hurts me to think about what my little boy went through.

I hate myself for now finding out sooner. I cry from guilt whenever I see him upset. Whenever he comes in my room crying at night, I fight as hard as I can to not cry in-front if him. I literally love him more than anything else in the entire world, and I hate that I didn’t find out Sooner.

fuowf9,Sexual abuse,"When i was 6-7 years old I was molested by my neighbor who was 8-9 years old. He would always say it was just a ""game"" and it was normal and i was young and didn't know it was bad or wrong I just thought like he said it was a ""game"". This lasted for about 2 years until my mom caught us playing his ""game"". I think that scared him out of doing that to me but we would still talk and hang out from time to time because I still didn't understand what he had done at the time however as I got older I still didn't exactly understand but i grew weary towards him and eventually stopped talking to him altogether. I didn't realize the affect it truly had on me until I started to understand what he had done to me and i slowly grew depressed which resulted in me blocking myself off emotionally to everyone. I really don't understand how to cope because after my mom found us it just got swept under the rug and now i don't know how to even talk to people about it because i question if it really was his fault on a daily basis. I want to ask to see a therapist and talk about it but the anxiety and fear from what happen creep in whenever I try.  To this day im affected by it, i have severe anxiety and my abuse creeps into my mind when i try to sleep and then im up for hours starring at the ceiling and thinking about if i would be different if it didn't happen or if i am too sensitive and it's not as bad as i think but at the same time i know it was bad enough to affect me. I cant even talk to a cashier or a delivery man without being scared and on edge. Honestly i don't even know what to think anymore i just feel broken.

fupc8x,Was this abuse?,"When I was a kid, I used to live in my old house with my mom and dad (that had a divorce shortly after) and my two siblings.

When they were together things were messy, they were always fighting and they would put eachother down so that we ""had to choose a side"" which i find stupid. My dad was always pretty angry, he worked until late and when he came home he would sit in the kitchen table to ask us about our grades and homework. If we had bad grades he would call us every name in the book, insult us ( saying things like mother fuckers, son of a bitch and other insults in spanish that I can't translate), he would throw our books to our heads very agressively, slaps on the face and he would make pretty scary threaths to us. So we were basically terrified of the moment when he came home. And I think that he was the least abusive, now comes my mum.

After my parents divorce, my mom won custody and we had to live with her. She would also get really angry for bad grades and other meaningless things. When we took a test, she would ask us everyday if we got the results and she would make threats. If we got a bad grade on the test, she would insult and ridicule us all the way back home from school and she would say that as soon as we got home we would get what we deserved. As soon as we stepped out of the car in the parking garage, she would hit us and pull our hair while insulting us. We all had lunch together every day and she would wait until everyone  ate all the food in their plates and if someone didn't she would force the food into hes or her mouth pretty agressively, one time she even tied us up to our chairs with belts and didn't let us go until we finished. Then she got a boyfriend and things got worse. She wouldn't sleep in the apartment and intead she preferred to sleep at her boyfriends house, so we would only see her when she came in the morning to take us too school and after school to take us home and when she took us to school or home she would yell at us and tell us that she would rather be with her boyfriend than with us. And that went on until my dad got worried that she was neglecting us, so he got custody of us.

I'll tell you guys the worst moments. Once I got a bad grade on a test, so my mom decided to hit me with a belt and she decided to do it creatively, so she asked my sister to choose the belt with which she would hit me and then while she hit me with it she would insult me, call me every name in the book and she told me that she wanted to kill me. Another time me and my siblings were playing with a really old guitar that was from my mom, so my sister accidentally sat on top of it and it got a small crack, my mom came to the room and saw the crack in the guitar, she got really mad and she just grabbed the guitar and she straight up hit me in the head with it as hard as she could and the guitar actually broke in my head.

All those things were ongoing, there's many more stuff I can think of, but the post would be too long.

fupugk,I was sexually abused by my older brother when I was little,"When I was a little girl I had to sleep with my brother during the summer because it gets very hot here and his room had A/C. One night I woke up to him touching me and I just got up and told my mother. She went to the room and told him “ ugh don’t do that” and sent me to the other room with no A/C on a hot night and barely said anything to him. No one said a thing about it after that and he wasn’t even grounded to anything. At my dads house I had to sleep in the same room as my brother because the other room was used as storage. Yet again woke up to him trying to pull my pants down. I told my dad and my dad talked to him for a little and then again no punishment and I was sent to sleep in the storage room. This happened several times and I just never said anything ever again because my parent failed to do anything. He then raped me at my grandmothers house and no one notice, no one knows. To this day no one talk about what he did to me, I never got therapy for it and they act as if it didn’t happen. One day, as always, my mom was talking about how great his son is and how nice he is and this day I just snapped and screamed at her to stop saying that. I asked her if she remembered that he used to molest me as a child and she did nothing to stop it. She said she remembers but he’s her son and can’t do anything about it.

Something significant happened recently; I managed to find out where my abuser lives and I went and knocked on his door. 

I now want to turn what happened into a short film and I have teamed up with u/florianbroude to do this. 

Florian is a talented videographer who I met at the start of this year. He has an incredible passion for everything he creates, he works hard and I literally couldn’t have asked for a better person to help tell this story. 

More info coming soon.

fuy2kg,My Mother Never Has My Back,"Hello,

As the title explains it-- I feel like my mother never has my back (emotionally)... If I ask he career advice she's all in but emotionally.. ehh. Is there a name for this? A support group or podcast?

For example:

I had JUST graduated HS and hanging out my parents house. Me and my ex-boyfriend had a disagreement about something (I can't remember).      To get back at me he went and told my mom that I refused to take him home. My mom blows up at me and of course I get mad because he lied and I tell him I will take him and her I will take him home and I remember yelling at her ""What kind of person do you think I am??"" She stops the both of us and tells us that she will drive because she was afraid that we would have a wreck if I drove him because things had gotten heated at this point. In the car me and my ex continued arguing and she said I was acting like a psychopath. Long story short we took him home. He ended up apologizing to me and told my mom that he'd lied but she still didn't believe me or him.

Ex #2
I was even younger-- 16 maybe. I had fell into a really really deep depression 2nd semester. I think it was because I ended up smoking weed and drinking at a party and i was very disappointed in myself at the time because I said I would never do that (it was 2012 ppl) lol. 

Anyway, nobody knew I was depressed. I still looked the same, act the same, and my grades were at the highest that semester but I felt like I was dying inside. It all came to a head when one Saturday I was working at my PT job and I found myself disassociating and moving so slowly my boss and everyone else noticed. I wasn't high or anything just deeply depressed. I got sent home and that night I told my mom and dad I was sick. I felt so depressed and I wanted to kill myself and everything that had happened at work... And she yelled at me so bad to the point that I went from standing to shrinking into a ball  holding my knees and crying more. She told me that the psych would just feel me with drugs so that I would be numb, take my car away, and she would NOT attend the sessions with me if I went. My dad was shocked but supportive and told me he would go with me but he didn't really defend me from my mom. At the time I don't even think he had the language to defend me.. again this 2012 and I live in kinda rural place. SN: My brother was diagnosed with ADHD and she attended the sessions with him 10 years prior. Anyways it's a miracle I ended up surviving that summer and I'm happy to report I'm doing well though depression and anxiety as still is apart of my life sometimes.

Sometimes I feel like she thinks I'm a monster and idk why. When she's in trouble I'm the first one to be there for her but when something happens to me she's the first one against me. I'm not understanding why she rejects me but wants me to be under her all the time.

fuyymn,Imagine that:,"Imagine that...

Imagine That:  You are on a road trip and things become suddenly clear.  Your husband is a stalker and you are his victim.  He has molded you into the embodiment of his dead wife, even having your ring encased in her diamond ring’s stones (which you understand after the fact, creepy) and dying your hair; her color, and trying to make you gain weight (2+2, anyone?). 

You have attempted to leave him twice and he has every move that you planned blocked by the time you run out of private assets.  After using your private funds, this is the FINAL chance you have.  You have made it out THAT door with suitcases packed for a trip you knew would give you the chance to escape that monster of a man that looks so benevolent and appears a ‘kind’ man that looks great to the neighbors. They even report to him about your daily activities. They bring him details of your leaving the house and if you left with/without the car that’s not in your name that is monitored by 9 different tracking devices.  You knew that you could never go to police about him.  You found out that horrible truth with the photo proof of him beating the crap out of you and bruises all over the body in places that don’t show the regular ways, and that this man could charm the socks off anyone he put his mind towards by literally bribing the officers.  You absolutely learned the science of people who get away with physical abuse.

 This man has humiliated you.  He ordered you to stop working, except working for him under his circumstances.  He made you cancel anything, even personal travel to exist outside of HIS world and this country.  He had you move to Florida and installs video cameras with audio (without your permission) to surveil you.  You don’t realize it at first, until he comes at you with the surveillance, and you now notice that he has been listening to all calls to friends and family about how strange and obsessive he is, and you are not happy.  He then wants to surveil the calls further, in person, and you are ordered to tell everyone in your recent contacts (convincingly) that you are fine and you’re happy….this is so far from the truth that you even start hiding your iPhone that you had…he refuses to help you keep it functioning and it disappears for 1.5 years with its evidence in tact. 

 He finally figures out that (when you have left) you aren’t going on that road trip to see your ‘family’ and immediately PACKS up your entire house while you’re out of town.  This is the house that bordered on the Everglades where he threatened he could dump you in a ‘careless’ argument that ‘meant nothing’ in an upside-down grave. That comment was meant to make you believe that this was a deadly threat. It was supposed to get your attention; oh but no, not a threat….’just calm down baby, I’ve been talking to your mother on the side’!  He said ‘he says, she says….or she doesn’t.’  This mother of yours wants $$$$$ and she can’t have enough.  He also knows you’re fearful of just being cashed out by the $200,000.00 life insurance policy on you through your gun-toting brother and mother’s means.

 Your house (Just Think)….after you survived Hurricane Katrina by a thread, fire, a divorce, tornadoes, an earthquake, living homeless in NYC off and on, and then Hurricane Irma.  Everything that you have worked for, everything that you own, everything that only your memories can unlock…..they (your life, your well-being, your love and caring efforts, your EXPRESSION and SOUL) are being held hostage.  In that house are the Original! paintings you purchased when you were in Greece and the Disney Lithographs that were registered and purchased from both Florida and California.  Also included are the art pieces from NYC, Atlantic City and New Orleans.  Let’s not forget the hat collection from Fleur de Paris in New Orleans, off Royal Street (valued at $10,000).  Those hats were magnificent and an investment….they made it out of Hurricane Katrina, vintage, increasing their value.  $200,000 in wardrobe that were original and vintage pieces were also stolen by that muck of a man.

Your father was recently murdered and buried.  He was buried during Hurricane Irma, where your family knew he was beyond your reach during hurricane recovery.  You are the firstborn and you know that he wanted to be buried as a Vietnam war veteran and they would have granted his wishes if only there were a day or two more.   He also would have wanted his FIRSTBORN to attend any funeral or memorial.  Instead of being honorable people, they buried him next to kin with whom he had grievances and without his firstborn able to attend due to the national tragedy of circumstances.  They also pieced him out and granted a plea deal to his murderer without asking me if I agreed.  I found it out by news.

 

Back to the house, where you still have memories of your father…things he gave you…clothes he left behind planning to visit you again.  Passport id, driver’s license, and personal papers (which you cleverly set aside to start over, only leaving what you could easily replace) were left behind

 

Your blood mother, sister and brother stole everything you left in their ‘safekeeping,’ stating you weren’t responsible enough to own it.  There went another $100,000.  You don’t speak to them anymore and they don’t care to try to contact you ever again since you have nothing else in their eyes to steal from you...

fuzvug,"I'm not used to healthy relationships, now what?","TLDR: I am finally in a healthy loving relationship after moving out from my emotionally abusive household. My relationship with my ex of 3 years wasn't healthy at all. Now that I'm being loved, I am constantly questioning why he loves me so much and why my friends love me so much. How do I deal with this?

TW: Sexual abuse, emotional abuse, self harm, addiction. 

This is probably going to be a long post with a lot of unnecessary background. 

I know age is going to come into question here, but please just leave it be. I've already been ridiculed enough on reddit about it. I am (f18) and my boyfriend is 30. As I mentioned above I recently moved out of my emotionally abusive household. I couldn't take it anymore and left in the middle of the night  back an hour and a half to where my college is. The school has us leave because of the coronavirus so I am now living with my boyfriend. 

I have a very long past of mental health issues. He knows all of it. I recently relapsed with self harm because everything in my life is crazy right now (been doing it for a decade). He also used to self harm and is a recovering addict (one year clean! :)). I wrote a letter about how I relapsed and felt so guilty and angry about it. When we met I was in the midst of recovering from bulimia and sh. 

I ended up showing him the letter I wrote. I cried and was apologizing while he comforted me by holding and kissing me and told me I have nothing to apologize for. He started kissing the sh and I started crying even more. He kept doing silly things to make me laugh. 

I ended up being a day clean afterwards then cut again last night. He again said I have nothing to apologize for and that I have to take it one day at a time. I've never felt this comforted and loved in my life idek what to do with it.

Now I know that people are going to try to warn me about his age and past. For once in my life, I actually have a good friend group that don't do stupid shit like I used to have in the previous years. I have at least 10 different people, his age and my age and in between, that cautiously support us. I have a support system if I need to get out. I am safe and we met through our friends of different age groups in September. I don't want to worry about these things but it needs to be said since I know I'll get ripped apart like last time on here. 

With his past, his fiance passed away from an OD two years ago. I try to support him as best as I can with it, as he is completely open with his past. He has gone from going to jail over drugs, losing his wife, and losing everything to being a district manager and reclaiming his life over the course of two years. He goes to NA meetings at least once a week, though now with COVID they might switch to online. 

With my ex of 3 years, I was not a healthy relationship at all. I was frequently pressured into doing things I didn't want, like sending explicit photos when I should have been in classes, or him trying to get me to do things when my dad has cameras all around the house (my dad is an entirely different story that I'll explain in a minute. Recommend reading the TLDR if you don't want to read more and more paragraphs). There were very few times I felt loved in that relationship. We ended up breaking up for various reasons, but mainly because he was flirting with other girls repeatedly and just wasn't giving the effort I was putting into the relationship. Felt like I was only used for sexual gratification.

I was also sexually abused as a child, so I have a lot of issues that stem from that, like PTSD. My ex would throw it aside like no issue while my boyfriend makes sure that I'm okay before anything happens. 

And now to my father. My father raised me on his own. My mother was in and out of jail my whole life. My dad is emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. He choked me when he first found out I was self harming at 13 and later threatened to kill himself multiple times from when I was 15-17 if I cut again (and I did, he just didn't know). I couldn't go to therapy or get mental health treatment unless I signed the papers that essentially gave him access to what me and the therapist talked about. Right now I have very little contact with my father as I'd like to keep it that way while I get my life sorted out. 

Before COVID happened, I was enrolled in college 1.5 hours away from him and took great use of the mental health resources the school had. Part of the thing my father does is use my financial dependence as a reason to abuse me. He never let me get a job, even though I had been begging for once since I was 11. I told my father about the sexual abuse (from my greatgrandfather from when I was 9-12) and we went to court. He didn't listen to me after he asked if I wanted to take the court case further and speak in front of a jury so that my greatgrandfather went to jail. i dont even know if the man is alive or not now. He didn't face any legal repercussions and I ended up losing 40 or so extended family members because of it. I try not to guilt myself over it. While there were times I was genuinely loved by my father, it often came with a cost, a lot of the time financial. I won't be able to afford my college without my fathers support, so my current plan is to get a few jobs and take a break from college at the moment but pursue it later in life. I'd like to eventually go into the biotech field. 

So where this puts me now is I'm pretty insecure with some untreated mental health issues. I don't know what a healthy relationship looks like, though the current relationship with my boyfriend appears to be pretty damn healthy and loving (anyone want to give out a list of normal/not normal things in a relationship??). 

I am often questioning why my boyfriend or my friends love me. I genuinely don't understand it. When I ask my boyfriend or close friends, they say because ""you're you"". Because I'm a nice, caring person. This is an absolute mindfuck to me. I'm not giving them anything necessarily, and I think that's what bothers me. I'm not necessarily giving sexual gratification, or giving in to my fathers control issues. What am I giving? Love? Friendliness? It doesn't seem like enough. It feels like there's a catch. 

So what to I do with this, all this love and affection? It's healthy, from my friends and from my boyfriend, or at least it appears to be. I don't know how to handle it (I don't dislike it at all, I'm just not used to it and am trying to be cautious about it because I don't want to end up in another abusive situation). 

Any suggestions or thoughts are appreciated. I am willing to have a discussion about my boyfriends age and things like that, I'd just like to not be attacked for it like last time on reddit. If you made it this far reading all of this mess, thank you.",helpmeplease2023,2020-04-04 12:39:28,3,1329,34.81,30.98,86.49,39.2,16.01,14.07,94.06,59.97,20.17,14.6,11.06,0.53,0.38,2.41,0.23,5.57,4.51,15.43,9.56,6.32,7.75,2.56,19.26,4.36,3.16,1.66,1.58,2.33,6.7,3.69,2.93,0.45,1.35,0.38,11.29,1.13,1.2,0.23,3.99,11.59,2.03,2.11,1.35,3.24,1.5,3.39,1.2,0.38,0.45,0.38,2.78,0.15,1.58,0.38,0.08,8.5,3.91,1.13,2.03,1.28,0.6,5.79,11.74,0.83,14.9,1.66,5.57,7.6,1.58,0.23,0.3,0.3,0,0.23,0.83,0.15,0.38,0.08,0,0,13.69,5.72,2.78,0.15,0,0.6,0.08,0.15,0.15,2.78,1.2,0.08
fv0fu6,I'm 24 this year and my dad still controls everything in my life what can I do to get through to him to let me live.,"First off I want to start with a back story to highlight the severity of my case. My dad was arrested 4 times, would have been a lot more if he didn't psychologically train us not to call the police. He's extremely abusive, physical abuse was at an all time high and occurred 6-7 days a week, until i went to high school, this included drowning, being shoved down the stairs being forced to lay down to be stomped on, being punched in the face from the day i was born til I was 14 years old. My mom was abused for a long time as well, being stabbed in the head by him on an occasion, choked til her neck was purple on many occasions and nearly killed on many others, my mom was a single worker who worked at a factory all her life to provide for the family while he reaches out his hand for money an forces her to give him money, then would continue to play victim and stays at home and does absolutely nothing. What i do struggle with is being able to live any sort of life. I have restrictions on every single thing I do, me and my younger brother who is 17 years old this year and my older brother who will be 25. Our lives consist of a schedule that has to be followed, it starts with bed times, we are forced to sleep at 9pm no later than 10pm and latest we can wake up is 9am on any given day. We're not allowed friends not even allowed to mention the word friends or he'd go ballistic, we aren't allowed to have any hobbies whats so ever, on our spare time if we're not working or anything we're forced to follow him around to watch him do his hobbies or he gives us a scheduled activity. We aren't allowed to leave the radius he allows us to travel. Our day starts off the same, no matter what, he'll wake up and start going off on us and call us stupid fucking animals, and start going completely ballistic for absolutely no reason just because he wakes up earlier than us. Sometimes i might wake up to all of my belonging on the floor, he might take out things from my cabinets throw them everywhere and force me to put them back. He's constantly telling us how we're a bunch of fucking stupid useless bitches (excuse my language). We are really kind individuals who do exactly as he says but even then i believe he gets bored that or hes extremely bipolar and likes to lash out when he wakes up. My older brother hasn't had a single friend in 10 years and hasnt been out with friends even once, my dad expects us to live exactly like that so he can continuously bully us. He doesn't allow anybody to talk to him because he believes hes higher up, if we even say anything to reason with him he'll go completely crazy start smashing things and yell at us to shut our fucking mouths and all we're saying is bull shit. We constantly get controlled and he constantly repeats the same things over and over again, a recent example would be my older brother being tired from a long irregular work schedule and he decided to take a 1 hour nap at 4pm and my dad went completely ballistic because we're not allowed to take naps in the house, another time is he came in my room while i was sleeping and my he realized i moved in my sleep that night meaning i shift around, (im only allowed to lay straight and not move) because my blanket is no longer neat anymore and he doesn't like seeing things not looking the way he wants them to even if we're asleep, he's also a complete neat freak. Will not allow us to move out and he wont move even knowing we always have issues in the house everyday and the house is always extremely loud. He doesn't allow anybody to be happy he believes hes the only one who should have the power in the house and everyone needs to obey everything he says or he'll go ballistic again and attempt to murder us or burn down the house while we sleep. I can't do anything in this house without getting in trouble, when i was still in school i would get in so much shit because i would say i have exams and he didn't understand so he would ask, why the fuck do you have exams all the time? and start going ballistic so i wouldn't be able to study, he constantly over exaggerates things to his peers to paint us as the bad guy and him as the victim. In the house he abuses us then plays victim that we never leave him alone, but we honestly do all the house chores and everything he wants from us yet he picks fights for no reason and says its because we're bad kids and don't listen to him. He'll hold grudges for years, such as reminding my older brother that when he was in high school he was interested in making music and was on his computer often because of that, and til this day i hear it all the time and him going around telling everybody that we're in ISIS and we're terrorists because we use the internet. I dont know what to do sometimes, I suffer from extreme anxiety and depression and attempted to kill myself on numerous occasions, my older brother suffers even more and has absolutely nobody. I put my foot down to try to reason with him numerous times but til this day he only pushed us harder and just tells us to jump in front of a train to kill ourselves already. He says he says all these things and he controls us so we can be good kids and we can have a good life. Now he's enforcing his laws heavily on my little brother after he's seen me and my older brothers health issues because of him. What can i even do at this point? I really don't have any options at all. Calling the police was out the picture, because of complications with my mom, only thing i've come up with all this time was to become rich through businesses im looking to start so we have a way out.",Techonme,2020-04-04 13:12:05,1,1117,29.99,81.22,47.87,4.67,37.23,14.77,94.54,60.88,20.5,15.67,5.28,4.3,0.09,5.73,0.27,4.83,4.48,14.32,9.76,5.46,8.5,2.86,19.16,4.66,2.42,1.34,1.34,2.33,4.57,1.25,3.31,0.27,1.79,0.45,16.38,1.43,0.45,0.54,6.98,13.43,1.34,3.4,1.52,2.6,3.13,3.04,2.06,0.63,1.16,0.27,2.95,1.43,1.16,0.36,0,11.82,5.55,0.72,4.48,0.9,0.27,3.04,13.61,1.7,18.26,2.42,7.7,8.42,1.88,0.81,1.16,0.36,0,0.45,1.07,0.72,0,0.27,0.09,0,9.4,2.51,3.13,0,0,0.18,0,0.09,0,3.13,0.36,0

fv410z,afraid that i will never be able to get over it or heal,"I have had suicidal thoughts sense i was a kid and it hurts me to know my chances of ever ""healing"" or ""moving on"" or anything like that are very slim. I never received any real help EVER. Ive only ever been given antidepressants/generic meds and they fucking suck. I never got anything like what other people talk about, i didnt get any happiness or high, or anything good, only side effects. Tbh I hate hearing about people who have had good experiences with therapy, doctors, or medication. 
I have talked to therapists before and they did nothing for me, they literally dont care at all. I get told that ""Im young and things will get better when im older"". This is the type of shit a ""trained therapist"" of 30 years or something said to me.
Nobody has ever taken anything i say seriously. Its a shame cause i really respected doctors and when i was like 8 and 9 i wanted to be a doctor when i grew up cause i wanted to help people. Now i hate most of them cause i realized most doctors/therapists arent smart at all and they are full of shit. Sometimes i regret not ending my life when i was 11. I was looking into buying fentanyl last month and its pretty pricey... i wish i wouldve been prescribed fentanyl and died already. None of my family members have done anything for me either. When i was going through a hard time around 12/13 and was barely passing school and got locked in a psyche ward none of my family members came to check up on me or asked how i was doing. Even after i left i didnt hear a word from them.
Yet when an druggie/abusive family member of mine died, a bunch of them went and visited him in the hospital and brought flowers and shit even tho he was barely even awake and probably had no idea what was going on around him. It must be nice to be normal and have a normal life.",taylorlikesspaghetti,2020-04-04 16:53:52,3,364,12.45,14.19,89.63,17.75,18.2,13.74,93.68,60.44,19.23,13.46,10.71,0,0,0.82,1.92,5.77,3.3,11.54,11.26,9.07,8.79,3.57,21.7,4.67,2.75,2.75,1.65,2.75,6.59,3.02,3.57,0.55,2.2,0.55,9.07,0.82,0,0,0.82,15.38,1.65,1.37,1.65,6.32,3.02,4.12,2.47,0.27,1.1,0.55,5.77,0.82,4.67,0.27,0,8.24,2.2,0.55,3.57,2.75,0,10.71,8.79,1.37,14.56,2.75,4.67,7.42,1.37,0.82,0.82,0.55,0,0.82,1.92,1.37,0.55,0,0,0,10.99,5.77,1.92,0,0,0,0,0,2.2,0,0,1.1
fv497p,Was it sexual abuse?,"I’ve posted here before and on a lot of different subs about this because it’s just been really distressing for me. 

Ok so one of my biggest problems is the doubt I have about the abuse. I don’t know if what happened constitutes abuse and I have been having doubts about it. So I am asking for the opinion of people on this subreddit because it just is really bothering me.

So when I was 12M I was at my uncles cottage and I was in the lake with the neighbour’s kid who was ~3-4 years older than me I think, and we were play fighting kind of. He brought us to a place in the lake that was covered by trees so no one could see us, and he pulled me towards him and wrapped his legs around mine and held them closed. He was holding my wrists before he reached down and started touching/grabbing me through my swim trunks which were just soccer shorts. I don’t know how many times he touched me, it may have only been once I don’t remember. I was trying to escape and I was saying stop. It didn’t last very long I don’t think and he didn’t really do anything but touch and grab me. Does that count as sexual abuse? I don’t know anymore. It’s just really overwhelming. I hate feeling the doubt along with the pain.

fv7qe7,is it my parents or is it me? (long post ahead sorry but i REALLY need help pleaseeee) thanks,"please help! this quarantine is making me question a LOT of things about my home life and the topic of my parents’ relationship with me is reallyyyyyyyyyy weighing on my mind. i need to know if i’m being a bad daughter and dramatic or if my parents are to blame. they’ve done things i don’t like but i can also be rude. here’s what’s going on.
- for starters, my parents are often VERY nice! we’ll make jokes with each other at the dinner table and laugh with each other and watch master chef together. they aren’t always awful and i’d say they’re nice quite a bit (like 60% of the time)! they do a lot of good things for me and i know they care about me. but there’s a lot of stuff they have done that makes me uncomfortable and upset so i don’t know what i’m supposed to think about it. 
- my dad has hit me in the past, but it’s a lot less often than before nowadays. today it’s like extremely rare that he will actually do anything (he hits like once or twice a year nowadays so veryyy rarely)
- my dad does get mad a lot though and yells. he makes threats to slap me or “break my face.” but i think maybe i’m doing something to provoke him; we have an ant problem in my house (i know, what awful timing haha) and i kinda forgot about it and brought noodles to my room. my dad was very mad and yelled at me saying he was going to slap me. so i’m thinking it’s my fault here because i shouldn’t have done that. i tried to explain myself but he wouldn’t listen. he’s broken things once or twice.
- my mom is kind of a different story. she used to do this thing where she’d act like a baby and speak in a baby voice and talk about how she needs hugs and she’s give me these super tight hugs that made me feel like i was suffocating. i told her to stop and she’d get upset and say that i didn’t love her and give me the cold shoulder. even my dad does this thing where he gives me a lot of hugs and kisses but like excessively? i tell them i don’t like it but they don’t stop or listen to me.
- my mom got a call from my school because they had found out i was self harming. my mom told me that i wasn’t depressed and didn’t look depressed and that i was being dramatic. she had it a lot worse than me.
- my mom used to go through my search history often because i was caught doing things other than my homework while on my computer. this isn’t a very often occurrence though.
- my mom also says a lot of embarrassing things about me in front of other people and i don’t think she realizes how embarrassing she actually is. i told her i didn’t like it and she said i was being too hard on her.
- sometimes when i get into arguments with my dad, he tells me to stop being mad or stop being angry. when i cry he’s like “stop crying!” or “”why are you crying!???”
- my father doesn’t check my grades anymore but often asks me questions time and time again. he says “i don’t care about your grades” but then he always asks me how i’m doing in school and if i’m completing all my online work. when i brought it up later he’s like “i don’t care about your grades, i never said that” but i CLEARLY remember him asking and pressing me about my grades (bg info: he’d make my sister cry a lot and put a lot of pressure on us to be at the top of our class and it took a huge mental toll on her so he promised he’d stop checking our grades and apparently hasn’t checked since).
- i’m also really irresponsible and don’t do my chores very often. my room is a mess and i forget my homework and these habits haven’t changed. they usually hit me and yell at me when there’s a reason for it. i’m also kind of sarcastic and talk back a lot. i make a lot of mistakes and i don’t think i’m a very good person.
- my parents call me an idiot and stupid but only when they’re mad, not like as a pet name you know?
 there you have it. bottom line: they’re not that nice but i’m no angel either. i make a lot of mistakes and can be rude so i think i deserve it. if you made it here, thank you SO much for taking the time to read all that. can you tell if my parents are being abusive or if i’m being a bad daughter? thanks :))",raspberriesyeet,2020-04-04 21:17:37,9,837,4.2,25.93,80.52,6.87,16.74,9.8,96.89,63.44,25.45,19.35,13.02,0.6,0.96,3.7,1.08,6.09,4.3,9.56,12.19,7.77,10.75,2.87,22.58,3.7,2.51,1.67,0.6,2.51,8.12,3.23,4.9,0.84,2.03,0.84,14.34,2.63,0,2.63,2.75,16.73,2.39,2.63,1.67,5.62,0.96,6.33,2.75,0.36,1.79,0.6,0.84,0.24,0.12,0,0.36,6.09,2.51,0.72,0.96,0.96,1.43,4.66,15.05,0.72,9.8,0.96,3.46,5.26,1.67,0.36,0.96,0,0.12,0,0.48,0.12,0.36,0,0,0,18.04,4.66,0.84,0.24,0.12,0.84,0.6,1.31,1.31,6.69,1.31,0.12

fvacbs,My(M22) story with reproductive coercion,"""Reproductive coercion (also called coerced reproduction or reproductive control) is a collection of behaviors that interfere with decision-making related to reproductive health.[1] These behaviors are meant to maintain power and control related to reproductive health by a current, former, or hopeful intimate or romantic partner,[2][3] but they can also be perpetrated by parents or in-laws.[4] Ultimately, these behaviors infringe on individuals' reproductive rights and reduce their reproductive autonomy.[5]"" wikipedia

Reproducive coercion is a form of abuse. And it happened to me.

I was 20 with a 30 year old partner. The first time we did it I asked her if she used birth control and she said yes. I later discovered that she was not using any for the time we were together. I first discover she did not used birth control but was infertile, then I discovered she was not infertile and wanted to have a baby. When she talks about baby I realise now that she never talk of the father as if it wasn't part of the equation.

At the time I didn't use condom because it hurted me. I was innexperienced and it was dumb, if you have trouble with condom , try the brand ""mysize"" they have a lot more variety of sizes and you should find the one that is comfortable for you. Once I told her I would like to use condom to be sure, she pressured me not to.

Luckily for me she did not became pregnant. The reason is simple : for some reason I was unable to cum during our intercourses. I think it was psychological since I was able to upon changing partner.

I faced many abuse in this relationship. Reproductive coercion is probably the worst. For part of my relationship I was panicked at the idea of getting ""stuck"" in this relationship if we had a baby and it deeoly impacted my psychological life : I had panick attack during work, new addiction appeared. I was unable to leave this relationship because I feared she would kill herself (she had self harm problem and suicidal tendency).

For month of the relationship I knew this relationship didn't makes me happy but it took a lot of time for me to actually leave. But I finally did it !

After I left she told me that she had a miscarriage and I was the father. At this moment I thought I would finally become totally insane (my mental health was very bad and I could easyly been hopitalized in a psychiatric ward at the time). However an urgent call with a friend that , saddly for her, had lived a miscarriage told there was a lot of inconsistency in her story. At this point I don't know if she had a miscarriage or not but I don't care and if anything I'm happy not to have a child.

As for right now I'm very happy and stable in my life. I love my life ! I habe so many people around me thzt care and I care for them. I'm single, since this experience I generally feel anxious when in couple but I'm a very happy single. I thought about child, I don't think I will have children. I don't dislike them but I think we're enough people on earth. Whatever happened (I can change my mind) will be a choice :) .

There is life after abuse. You have the right not to want kid and no one can force you too ! 

The common way of reproductive coercion are psychological : guilt trip , manipulation , gaslighting.
By lying about contraception and finally by tempering with contraception.
For cis men and trans women it can be done by poking hole in condom for example.
For trans men and cis women it can be done by microwaving pills for example.
There are a lot of ways to temper with contraception as theses fuckers are really inventive.
Reproductive coercion can also affect one choice of abortion.or sterilisation. 
It can be done by the partner but also by relatives or friend.

Reproductive coercion have been studied to have happened to 8.6% of women and 10.4% of men in a 2011 survey by the us center for disease control and prevention : this is a form of abuse that touch women and men. This is not an women only or a men only issue as we can sometimes read. This is also a shockingly common issue...

The large majority of men are not the one that become pregnant (the exception being trans men). I. My experience, a lot of people assume that because of that,  men should have ""less of a say"" in the matter. While you can't prevent a woman to get pregnant , no one can force you to be the impregnator and no one can force you to continue the relationship.

I wanted to share my experience about this issue. I wanted to tell you that it's not normal. You don't have to live this. This is a form of abuse that leave deep scar even when the pregnancy was not achieved. It can hurt multiple people : the victim of the abuse and the unwanted child that will probably feel he's not loved as much as other kids...

Also I realised that a part of the society glorify reproductive coercion like in this sickening (for me perssonally) video on wendy williams talk show.
https://youtu.be/5CNHwhHWPoQ

For me this is very difficult to watchand this phisically make me want to puke. 

In this scene reproductive coercion is clearly glorified with applause from the public. This is also shown has a somehow ""empowering"" thing to do when in reality it goes against the concepts of conscent that is the basis of a lot of feminism movement.

We could also think about how this could be a form of rape. When you have sex with someone that tells you she is on birth control, you're conscenting but if the person lie to you , you didn't conscent to the conditions of sex and it is (for me ) a form of rape.

I hope this post could have a positive impact into informing people about the issue !

TLDR : I have been abused by a women that lied about birth control ans tried to trick me into being a father without my conscent. This is a form of abuse known as reproductive coercion.

fvj4m1,I’m heartbroken.,"My husband (24m) and I (26f) has a great marriage. Until December, when things went crazy and he started to get abusive. He’s been emotionally abusing me since then. Constantly screaming at me and calling me worthless, stupid, a whore, and telling me he hates me and I’m dead to him. I was gearing up to leave him, when I found out I was pregnant. Since then, everything in the world has spiraled and I’m now unemployed. He’s taken advantage of that. Cut off my funds. I’m isolated from family who are several states away. I’m 16 weeks pregnant now, and we got into a huge fight today where I ended up crying and running out of the house. I couldn’t go far - I have no money, no car, nothing. I came back and just sobbed. He told me the whole reason he’s still here is the baby and that he hates me. He wishes I would leave him the baby and leave. Unfortunately right now women’s shelters are no help because he’s not physically abusing me, which sucks because they’re only seeing people who are being physically abused. I’m terrified of him. He told me he hates me and I have no where to go. I know if when all of this is over I do file for divorce, we’ll have to share custody because I can’t prove immediate danger to the child. I can’t share custody with him because who would keep an eye on him and make sure this doesn’t happen to our baby? What do I do?

fvjida,am i overthinking or is this abuse?,"Hey so i have been thinking about my past relationship and to me, it was full of manipulative movements and them taking advantage of me. I may be overthinking it but I wanted to ask for a second opinion to those who don't know me.

I will call this person Sammy, it is a unisex name after all. Also I apologise for lack of grammar, i'm typing this quickly for answers.

me and sammy had been together for 3 months before i ended up leaving them, it didn't end very pretty. the relationship in my view was dreadful and i hated the last two months of it. For context, we are students and i lived in their flat temporarily.

it started off great, we shared the same interests and well one thing led to another, i had a job at this time but they didn't, so i had to work most of the day since it was a busy time period. I would work practically a full time shift throughout the week, racking up to 40+ hours. The first days i stayed at theirs, they made the meals but i then offered to help them and even do some of them myself. we often had take aways as well.

After my shift i would head back to theirs, since a new game came out at the time, they had spent all night playing it and messed up their sleeping pattern, only waking up when i rang them to say i was on my way back. I would go into the store nearby, buy the meals and then cook every dinner for me and them for 3 months in total. I also made the drinks in the mornings and served breakfast. within a few weeks, Sammy had ran out of money and since I was the only one with income, I bought all of Sammy's dinners and snacks which we shared a lot of. We would eat and I would do the cleaning up, coming back to watch some tv shows, since Sammy had an opposite sleeping schedule, I would feel tired at midnight and wanted to sleep or was about to fall asleep during an episode, Sammy would proceed to shake me awake and prevent me from falling asleep, saying ""one more episode, one more"" until it ended up being 3am and I would need to wake up in two hours for work the next day.

I ended up abandoning my school work as the cycle got deeper and deeper, when i did try and do work, Sammy would stop me and say that they wanted to work alongside me. As the weeks go by and i spent so much money and time cooking for them, buying the food and do any form of errands, i wanted to go back home yet half my stuff was at Sammy's. When i did offer to sleep at mine or say i wanted to go home, Sammy always convinced me to stay and would get upset when i tried to leave.

One day I wanted to go on a night out with a friend, Sammy wanted to join but it was only a close friend night out only since it was a friend's birthday, Sammy didn't know this person which is why i apologised and said they couldn't come. Sammy got angry at this and demanded that I would be back by 2am, even texting me at 3am wanting me back at their flat, saying that they weren't happy since they said that I wasn't allowed out too late. Sammy prevented me from going to school without them and got angry at me for wanting to go to the library whilst they were having a nap, arguing with me until it was too late to go to school to do work.

On that same night out, when I came back to Sammy's flat, we talked for a bit and when we went to bed, Sammy grabbed my wrist and tried to make me touch them, I was drunk and Sammy was sober. I said no and pulled my hand away, Sammy proceeded to get pissy and tried to force me to go outside for a smoke with them when I was falling asleep in the bed. Sammy's reasons for this was that I didn't look drunk.

Sorry for the wall, this isn't everything that occurred during those months but the main things that got me concerned. To this day, Sammy owes me more than $500+.

EDIT: Sammy would often argue with me and give me a form of silent treatment, in arguments, I would be in tears and Sammy used the fact that they were calm in an argument to demand me to cool down for a more 'adult' conversation which would just make me give in.

In a lot of the arguments Sammy would mention how i didn't apologise for what i did wrong, when i do apologise, Sammy then says that the apology is empty because I'm just saying it as it's what they want to hear instead of actually being sorry.",OkFlatworm4,2020-04-05 12:19:49,3,858,53.91,37.64,88.87,14.5,28.6,9.32,93.59,59.21,18.3,12.94,9.21,0.82,0,0,2.91,5.36,5.36,16.55,8.97,5.01,7.81,1.4,19.58,5.36,1.98,1.86,1.63,2.21,3.73,1.4,2.21,0.35,1.17,0.58,9.21,0,0.23,0,0,11.19,0.82,2.21,3.26,1.98,0.93,2.45,2.56,0.47,1.52,0.58,3.26,1.4,0.23,0,1.63,7.93,2.21,1.63,2.45,1.17,0.7,8.62,7.46,0.82,19.11,3.15,7.58,9.56,2.21,1.05,0.47,1.17,0,0,0.58,0.12,0,0.12,0.23,0,11.54,3.38,5.01,0.12,0,0.12,0,0,0.23,2.33,0,0.35

fvmnly,I don't know what to believe anymore.,"TW: child rape 

I'm a symptom holder / sexual trauma holder alter in a dissociative plural system. This means I share this body with others. (there are 20+ of us)

I never understood why, despite my first recollections of abuse happening in my teens, my memories start at 7/8 years old. I never understood why I was hyper-sexual from the very first day I split off.

Recently the child trauma holder, Owen, showed me some memories.

It has become clear to me that my uncle sexually abused me in my sleep throughout my childhood.

I'm devastated. I've never felt so betrayed in all of my life, because this was the only member of my family who ever showed me any emotional support. He would comfort us when our parents abused us, and when my depression got worse.

Still, I can't deny these memories.

He talked to me about sexual stuff when I was too young to understand it. I woke up after sharing a bed with him, to find my pants around my ankles. He very angrily instructed me not to say anything that ""might get him in trouble"" even if it was a joke.

He's the only person I ever trusted, in my family... and he's the worst of them all.

I feel like the version of him I knew is dead. I feel like he's dead and all that's left in his place is a grotesque, paedophilic monster. I feel like I'm mourning the uncle I knew.

It's his fault I am too narcoleptic to function. It's his fault I developed sexual thoughts about adults when I was in primary school. It's his fault I have a terrible relationship with my own body and with sex as a whole.

fvo0i3,Abusive parents have reached a new low. Blaming me that if the cat dies it is my fault.,"Ive been back with my parents for 5 months now and as time goes on it is getting worse and worse and worse.

Today they both came in yelling at me, because i had my window open. 

It was a very warm day, they moan at me non stop for not opening it on warm days to let some air in, so i  did just that, i opened it this morning.

They come in, furious that the cant find the cat, that it is past *their curfew* and that they needed to be inside, and because my window was open it was my fault that they werent inside, and telling me that it is my fault if they die tonight, as there is apparently a cat killer around.

Not 10 minutes later the cat waltzes through his cat flap, after my parents were downstairs arguing about me and still saying that im the bad guy, that I may as well have killed the cat with my own hands *because i had my window open*.

Had they told me you know, earlier, or a days or weeks ago that there is this threat then sure. I would close it earlier. But they didnt, I even looked up about this strange cat killer and there isnt any reports of anything like that occurring in my area. 

It's just another thing to blame me and have a go at me about. Another excuse for them to throw me out.

I'm trying to get out myself but its impossible currently, I finally have the assessment saying im unfit for work *(which they refuse to believe is real by the way)* so Im able to afford living away from them, but there is no services open.",Cainde,2020-04-05 16:43:30,2,309,15.3,20.91,97.39,1,23.77,11.65,93.2,64.4,24.92,15.21,10.68,0,0.32,0.32,3.88,9.71,4.21,13.27,11,6.47,8.09,2.27,19.09,4.85,3.56,0.32,0.65,1.62,7.44,1.29,6.15,0.32,3.24,0.32,8.74,0.97,0.32,0,0.65,9.39,0.97,0.97,1.62,3.24,0.32,4.21,2.27,0.32,0.97,0.97,0.65,0.32,0.32,0,0,6.47,0.97,0.97,1.29,0.65,2.91,6.15,13.59,0.97,18.77,1.62,9.71,7.77,0.97,0,0.97,0,0,1.62,0.32,0,0,0,0.32,0,12.62,4.21,5.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.65,0.65,1.94
fvp3ka,I'm struggling and it's been 7yrs.,"Honestly I don't know how to cope right now.
I have PCOS and found out it's going to be really hard for me to have children. And then I found out a couple of days ago that my ex that used to strangle me just had babies, twin little girls. And I am so scared for them. What if he's still like that.

But the worst part is I was telling my therapist and I couldn't say his name. I couldn't do it, I froze and had a mild panic attack. I am so scared of saying his name. It's been 7 fucking years I should be able to by now and it's fucking my head.

fvp6ks,Ex Bf touched me while I was asleep,"So I tried posting this to r/relationships but they deleted it.

So about three weeks ago my bf and I (both 19) got back together and things were going really well. Although during the first week of getting back together, he started touching me in my private areas while I was asleep. I soon woke up from this and told him to stop doing that so he did.

This past week, I brought it up to him over text (we were talking about our boundaries together) and texted him “once, you started touching me in my sleep and you had no consent to do that. I was very uncomfortable with you doing that, and it’s not ok. Frankly, I am scared of you. That was sexual harassment. You have time to tell me what was going on, but I want to make sure that I wasn’t being taken advantage of.”

Once I texted this, he didn’t respond for a few hours (maybe 3 hours?) until I asked him to give me a call back and then proceeded to call him a few times. I was getting nervous that he was upset about something, so I texted him some more and said “hey is everything okay? Please call me back.” So he finally called me back and said that he would never take advantage of me, but he felt threatened by my text, and that he wanted to end the relationship. He wouldn’t listen to what I had to say, and kept talking (but I couldn’t hear him because I was crying). I told him that I didn’t mean to make it sound like a threat, I thought that he would talk to me about the situation. He then hangs up on me while I was mid sentence. In a frantic and weak moments I kept trying to text him and call him. then, he blocked me everywhere on all social media platforms. 

I just thought that if you’re mature enough to have sex, then you’re mature enough to talk about it. I will not text or contact him in any way again, but was it wrong of me to try to talk to him about this situation? I realize i should have worded it better, but I was feeling very uncomfortable about being touched without my consent.",clover2xx,2020-04-05 17:59:50,45,396,8.24,59.98,66.08,12.41,17.22,13.38,95.2,63.89,26.77,19.7,11.11,0.51,1.77,6.06,0.25,7.07,2.02,12.63,9.6,7.07,9.09,2.53,20.71,3.54,0.76,0.51,1.52,1.77,5.05,2.02,3.03,2.02,0.76,0.25,17.93,0,0.76,0,6.57,11.11,1.52,0.76,2.02,2.02,1.52,4.04,3.03,0,1.52,1.52,2.02,0.76,0.25,0.51,0,8.59,3.28,1.77,1.77,2.02,1.01,10.61,6.06,2.02,14.9,0.76,6.31,9.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.02,0,0.76,0.51,0.25,0,14.9,4.8,4.04,0,0,0.76,0,0,1.01,2.02,2.02,0.25
fvpmk2,"A little boy throwing a consistent tantrum, in a mans body. (TW)","I have a complicated history. You name it, ive probably been through it. Quarantine has brought out the worst in my family, and both my parents still go to work (my mom is a nurse practitioner, my dad could work from home but chooses not to). But the tension has risen in my family. My father does small things like inspecting the shower once I’m done showering to make sure I wiped it down correctly because “the water stains the shower.” To bigger things like grilling my mail person with questions as she was delivering my heart medication. He calls my mom a bitch and constantly puts her down, he even has a set bedtime for her. My mom is dealing with the elderly and trying to make sure none of them get coronavirus, her days are long and stressful, but she’s not able to go to bed early when she wants to. 

After my anorexic relapse, I quit my job and dropped out of college. I was dying. My body was deteriorating. And he called me “white trash” because I decided to choose life. This continued until I finally found a job. 

Then there’s my rapist. My rapist is part of my family. My parents pay his rent, utilities, and visit him every Saturday to buy him groceries. He is invited to every holiday because I’m supposed to “get over it.” Ive spent many holidays alone. 

My girlfriend and my friends have expressed deep concern for me, but I don’t want to leave my mom. What if he hits her? Or kills her? My girlfriend really doesn’t want me living here and wants me to move in with her. I want to, but moving gives me anxiety. Staying gives me anxiety. I’m not sure what anxiety I should face.

fvrkyp,"The peaks and valleys of abuse and why people might think ""spoiling"" children has a negative impact","I've heard it said that abusive relationships are characterized by high peaks and low valleys of emotion, where the valleys might involve violence and abuse, and the peaks might involve dramatic displays of love and affection. 

Some people who are unaware this pattern is common in dysfunctional relationships where there might be differing degrees of abuse might see the good and call it ""spoiling a child"". There was a case of extreme child abuse a while back where children were kept in literal chains, but photos surfaced of the perpetrators and their kids in Disneyland and it made some people doubt whether the abuse actually happened. All over the internet I would see people arguing that it couldn't have been as bad as news sites reported. To me, those Disney photos were in line with what I know about abuse as a survivor. I expect to see high peaks and low valleys.

I think the idea that you can ""spoil"" a child by being too soft comes from misinterpreting that high incidence of dramatic gestures of affection you see in abuse. People see it, which in and of itself might seem odd, and assume that by itself, it's the key to understanding problem behaviors in those children. What they might not be aware of is that the other side of the coin of those extreme highs of over the top gestures of love is the extreme lows of violence, abuse, and neglect.",BN975,2020-04-05 20:46:24,9,259,69.27,70.57,27.29,1,25.9,20.08,88.8,53.67,12.74,3.86,2.32,0,0.77,0,0.77,8.88,7.34,13.9,10.04,3.86,7.34,1.16,15.44,4.63,1.54,3.47,0,1.16,9.27,1.93,6.95,0.39,3.86,1.16,10.42,0,0,0,0,12.74,3.47,0.77,1.93,4.63,0.39,2.32,4.25,3.09,0.77,0.39,0.77,0,0,0,0,8.88,1.54,0.77,5.41,0.39,1.16,3.47,8.49,3.09,11.2,1.54,8.49,1.16,0.39,0.77,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.42,3.47,3.47,0,0,0,0,0,2.32,1.16,0,0

fvsgaf,I Once Had An Evil Stepmother,"My name is Leo. I am an abuse victim. It started in middle school. My mom wasn't the best parent at first, and because of certain factors that she didn't understand at the time, she was abusive. Even so, she loved and still loves me and unlike some people, she has apologized for the past and is currently the best mom a son could have. It's not that hard to admit when you were wrong. 

Around grade 11, junior year, I had to move in with my father and stepmother because of financial problems that my mother was having. I didn't mind, it was only supposed to be temporary. Until it wasn't. 

Living with my dad, stepmother, step-sister, and half-sister wasn't bad at first. I loved all of them, and I miss my sisters to this day. However, things took a turn for the worst very quickly. 

Yes, I was in a better household, but my mental health was still piss poor. I still had severe depression and anxiety as well as ADHD. I'd been untreated for years and I didn't know how to live as a normal teen with such poor mental health. It didn't help that I had been prone to self harm since middle school, the scars I had just barely fading, only to be replaced with new ones. 

My stepmother, didn't know how to treat or deal with a child who had mental health issues. She did, however, try to get me a therapist and even meds for my ADHD a year later.

However, as our relationship went downhill, so did my mental health, and when I talked to my therapist about it, she suggested that me, her, my step mom, and my dad sit down with her and discuss things. 

I told my step mom and she refused, saying that she'd be ""made the villain"" and that she wasn't about to be villainized. Soon after, I stopped seeing the therapist. 

Things between us proceeded to get worse. Because of my increasing depression, my grades in school were poor. She blamed that on me being ""lazy"" and not caring. I also didn't have any treatment for my severe ADHD, so things continued to fall flat. 

I was in no way a perfect kid. I lied a lot out of fear, I was sneaky, and I was very emotionally constipated so certain acts of kindness and love and other mushy things made me feel awkward or I'd get flustered quite easily. I was also very co-dependent and found myself in abusive relationships that ruined me even further mentally. 

Even so, nothing I ever did was out of malice. She didn't believe that. She always felt that my actions had some ulterior motive. Always thought that my actions weren't genuine and that I was a ""sociopath"" who didn't care about anyone else but myself.

I was no stranger to abuse tactics and manipulation, so at a few points, I tried to go to my dad. I was nervous each time and I'd ask him questions like ""does [redacted] not love me?"" He'd brush everything off as her being dramatic and there being ""too much estrogen in the house"". And, of course, he'd take it to her because, well, married couples discuss things with one another because of trust. That's normal. But, of course, she would get angry with me for even mentioning anything to my dad, saying that I was ""playing the victim"" and trying to break her marriage apart. Of course I wasn't, but she didn't believe that.

So, because of my fear of being yelled at by my stepmom, anytime something between us happened, I'd keep quiet and let her weave her web of manipulation, her crying to my Nana about me, lying to her friends about me, and basically making everyone around me angry at me because of a manipulated story that she'd created. Her oldest daughter, at times understood what I was going through, but there were also times where her oldest would side with her mom and then later tell me privately that it was out of fear. She didn't want to get onto her mother's bad side. It hurt though, because that only fueled her to continue abusing me. 

At some point in time, she stopped driving me to school. The school was around five minutes away, but because it ""messed with her child's routine"", she made me walk to and from school. If I was lucky, dad would be back from work by the time I was dressed so I could get a ride from him. 

Back then, I was very fond of Japanese melee weapons like kunai and shuriken as well as just knives in general. I thought they were cool and I owned some. Now, at some point in time, my stepmom got to a point where she didn't trust me at all. Even so, I believe she enjoyed being mean to me because she ordered me to hand over my weapons because she ""feared for her life"" and felt that I would stab her in her sleep. At this point, I was very much done with her nonsense and didn't feel like entertaining her so I was straightforward with her. I told her that those weapons were for myself and if I had wanted to ever harm her, there were plenty of kitchen knives on the counter to do so, so taking my weapons was redundant and didn't make her any safer. 

Of course she didn't care. Instead of combatting my argument, she threatened to call the police on me if I didn't give her my weapons. So of course, I did. I never saw them again. One of them was a gift from a friend who went to the military. Sorry Brian.

I also remember that, when I placed the weapons on her bed she, with a smile said to me, ""You better not stab me with those, put them down gently."" She was patronizing me. 

When I got my first debit card, she didn't let me keep it. She would keep it in her purse, only letting me use it for things like food and hygiene. 

In the summer after 11th grade, she decided that she wanted to send me to Job Corps. I went along with it. One day, however, I needed new clothes to wear to my new job, and so she gave me my card. I ended up getting pickpocketed that day. She blamed me of course and didn't believe me when I said that someone pickpocketed me. She just said that I lost it because I was ""careless"". She then didn't let me go to Job Corps because she didn't trust me to not get taken advantage of. 

Now, during 11th grade and that summer, multiple times occurred where she'd lock me out of the house for something, whether it be grades, ""talking back"", or forgetting to do something, she'd fuss at me, escalate the argument, and then lock me out. At one point I DID end up sleeping in the garage. 

She also made me sleep on the floor. I, at first, had a blow up mattress, but after our dog got to it, she blamed me and then made me sleep on the floor because she didn't want me on any of her furniture. She also did not want me sleeping in her oldest daughter's room anymore. 

She wouldn't let me take showers any longer than 5 minutes and then would wonder why I stank sometimes or why my hair would be greasy (no time to wash my hair so it wouldn't get washed until she'd take me to get my hair done). 

Now, back then, because of depression, there were many things that were a struggle, one of them being personal hygiene. I stopped wanting to take care of myself because I wanted to die. Because of that, I'd been caught more than once not taking a shower and, of course, that made her furious. I can understand that. However, she started watching take a shower so that I actually took them. I appreciated that and still do. However, after a few times of doing that, she stopped and instead limited my time in the shower to 5 minutes only. 

I'd like to go off on a tangent and mention that, she only abused me when my dad was at work or asleep. Whenever he was around and awake, she'd tone it down immensely. I couldn't rely on my dad, however. Anytime I asked him for anything, she'd accuse me of using my dad and not caring about him. She'd guilt trip me saying that he'd done something for me and lost sleep or he'd done something for me and was late for work. Something to make me feel bad. So I stopped asking my dad for things unless it was absolutely necessary, and even then, I had to whisper. 

The abuse got to a point where she stopped treating me like a human. At one point, while I was sitting on the floor and crying because of her, she started walking around and sprinkling salt everywhere before finally coming to me and sprinkling salt on me, calling me a demon child. I remember there was one night where I was working late. She'd driven up to the drive through window and saw me talking to a coworker about work stuff, and when I'd finally gotten off work, she got angry at me saying that I wasn't being considerate of her time and that I was just standing around and joking with my co-workers while she waited for me to get off at 12 AM. I wasn't just standing around, nor was I joking. I was just as tired as she was and I was talking to my coworker about important work things. Of course, she didn't care. She was angry and when we got home, she started taking my things and throwing them away. She threw away my art supplies, she broke my guitar that I was gifted at my 8th grade graduation, and she threw away many other things that held sentimental value. I cried and begged her to stop and not to do that but she said I was being childish. The next morning, I was so tired of her being mad, I gave in and told her that she was right and that I was being childish and that I was glad she taught me a lesson. To this day, I'm still disgusted with myself for letting her manipulate me into some fucked up version of Stockholm Syndrome. 

She also stopped allowing me to eat the food in the house or use the hygiene products (soap, toilet paper, toothpaste). She even made me go to the local laundromat instead of using the washer and dryer at home. I had to buy everything and even when my dad cooked something, I had to pretend that I wasn't hungry. Either that, or my step-sister would sneak me some food and be a look out while I ate. Around that time, I was underweight to the point that I could donate blood during school blood drives.

Senior year came around and I was enrolled into a new school. It wasn't close by so I couldn't walk, and even though me and the girls were being dropped off at the same bus stop, she wouldn't drive me. She, instead, got me an Uber with my debit card every morning. 

At one point in time, getting an Uber to the bus stop every morning was too costly so, her and her friend, who acted as an aunt and babysitter, made an agreement that I would stay with her during schooldays and come back during the weekends. 

At some point during senior year, I was prescribed medicine for my ADHD. It did help me focus better, but it also put me to sleep, usually during lectures. It also didn't help that I suffered from insomnia (and still do :') ). So, of course, my grades once again plummeted. I was so terrified of my stepmom that, instead of showing my actual grades, I would make a fake progress report/report card. 

At some point in the year, something happened where my stepmom wanted me to talk to my dad about. It wasn't anything super serious but it brought out an argument between the two that I ended up blaming myself for. I hid in the closet of my step-sister's room and started self harming. The argument escalated into something about my dad doing something 12 years ago. It looked like she was going to leave my dad and I felt like absolute shit. That evening I tried to kill myself. It didn't work though because the tie that I used broke. 

I was still staying at my aunt's during the week so, during that night, after I came out of the shower, I thought my aunt was asleep. She wasn't, and because of that, she saw the cuts on my arms. She asked why and what happened and I broke down and told her everything. Luckily, my school was having a dress up day so I wrapped my arms up and dressed up like an anime character for the day. 

Somehow, she found out that I had told my aunt about what happened and she got angry with me saying that I was ""spreading her business"". I told her that it was my business too. She then asked why my arms were wrapped and I knew she knew what I'd done to myself. My aunt had tried to convince her that the wraps were part of my costume, but my step mom didn't buy it so I told her. She then said that I was doing that for attention and that the thing between her and my dad was my fault. She then threw me out of her car and continued to yell at me as I walked back into my aunt's mom's house. 

I don't remember how things got solved afterward but I think I remember her apologizing for blaming me. However, she used my dad. She told me that he was willing to do anything to keep her happy because he wanted to stay together. So she used that as a way to make sure she could do anything she wanted to me. 

Around the end of my senior year, my step mom and dad found out about my report card forgeries. They were rightfully angry and I almost didn't graduate. However, because of the faculty at the school, I was able to get my grades up and graduate. Graduation wasn't as amazing as I'd hoped. 

Throughout the time I spent with my stepmom, she manipulated both what I said about my mom and what my mom was saying to her. She made it seem like my mom was speaking bad about me and because of that, I didn't want to talk to my mom. In turn, she told my mom that I didn't want to talk to her because I was scared of my mom. There were times where I was able to talk to my mom and things between her and I got a bit better, but I wasn't in full contact with her. She also didn't like me talking to my Grammy because she believed that my grandmother ""coddled me"" and treated me like a baby. So I rarely got to be in contact with anyone on my mom's side. 

Because of that, we had a discussion where she asked if I wanted my mom to be at my graduation. I said yes but if it would make her uncomfortable then my mom doesn't have to come. She then used that and twisted my words basically saying that I didn't want Val at my graduation. I tried to tell her that no, I wanted both of them at my graduation but she just twisted it around and said that I just wanted her stressed. 

I will never forgive her for that. She stole a moment from me, my mom, and my grandmother. They didn't get to come to my graduation because she manipulated them into thinking that I didn't want them there. And in the end, my step mom didn't come to my graduation anyway. 

During the summer, things were seeming to get better. However, my mental health was still piss poor and I ended up doing something reckless. Out of anger for myself, I invited a guy over while no one was home and tried to have sex with him. It didn't really work out and I was already nervous and borderline on a panic attack so I told him to leave. 

I thought everything was ok, but on his way out, the guy accidentally dropped the condom. My dad found it, asked my stepmom about it, who in turn asked me about it. I panicked and lied at first, but the truth ended up coming out in the end. 

My dad was furious, my stepmom was livid. My dad left to do something and when he was gone, my stepmom told me to leave. She locked me out of the house, which I was used to by now, but then she came back out and told me to get off of her property or she'd call the police. I was officially kicked out. However, she told my dad that I left on my own accord. She also tossed my clothes into the outside garbage bin. 

I was house hopping from one friend's house to another's before my dad called up one of my uncles who let me stay with them until I had to move into the dorms for college. 

When I finally moved into the dorms for college, I was doing better. I was happier, finally away from my step mom. However, my mental health was at its worst, and because of that, I struggled sometimes. Even so, I managed to do ok for my first semester in college, but problems with money and a back and forth between the school and my dad caused me to have to leave. 

I asked to live with my dad and step mom temporarily. My step mom wasn't happy but agreed to let me stay for a few months. I then enrolled in a community college. By then I was an adult, so, for the most part, I took care of myself. My stepmom was a bit more lenient but of course, in bursts, continued her abuse. I was beyond tired of it, and I was beyond tired of my words being twisted around and manipulated. So instead of telling my dad by word of mouth, I'd voice record mine and my step mom's arguments from start to finish so there was no he said she said. 

My intention was to have my dad hear what went on when he wasn't home and then we could all sit down and assess the problems and talk it out. That would've been the adult thing to do. I was tired of her abuse and I personally just wanted to work our differences out. I was also in the middle of preparing to tell the both of them that I was transgender. I never got to do that. 

At one point, my stepmom pulled me into her room to talk to me, just me. She told me that she was planning on getting a divorce. I was shocked, I was upset, and I immediately started blaming myself in my head. She told me not to tell her daughter or my dad. I never peeped but that night I cried and felt like shit. These days, I don't know if she was serious, or if that was her attempt to get me to leave to save my dad's marriage. She'd always say how my dad needed her and how she didn't need him and that she could live on her own.  

One morning, however, I was woken up by my stepmom throwing my Christmas gift to her at me. It was a pair of pajama pants. I don't remember what she said, but she was angry and upset and kicked my laptop as well. 

My step-sister managed to tell me that my dad had had enough and texted my step mom that he was going to take him and I and move somewhere else. I was mortified. That wasn't what I'd wanted at all. I could hear my stepmom sobbing in the front and I felt like dying. She then left with her kids to take them to school and to go to work, taunting me to ""not bring any boys into her house again"". 

I then called up my boyfriend (at the time) and told him what happened. His mom told him and me that I could stay with them until my dad found a place to go because ""she wasn't gonna let me be my stepmom's punching bag."" So I grabbed what I could and planned to get the rest the next day. 

The next day came and I pulled up to my dad's house to talk to him and to grab the rest of my things. I never got to. I'd knocked on the door multiple times and as hard as I could. I beeped the horn, I yelled his name, I called him more than once. No answer. And I knew he was home and awake because I could see him just barely through the blinds and I could hear the TV. I understood. He'd chosen my stepmom. I don't know what she said or did to change his mind in those 24 hours, but it was obvious that I was out of their life for good. I never got to grab the rest of my things, which hurt me because there were many things that I had that held value, including both of my guitars and the bear that had belonged to my aunt on my mom's side. 

I was crushed and my mental health was absolute shit. But I was also finally rid of my abuser. I lived with my boyfriend at the time for around four months before deciding to live with my grandparents on my mom's side. It's been almost two years since I've moved to New Jersey and my mental health still isn't the best. Along with ADHD, anxiety, and depression, I also now suffer from PTSD and adjustment disorder. Even so, I'm doing worlds better than I was years ago. I have a therapist that I see regularly, I have treatment for my ADHD, and I'm in a stable and loving home as well as being out about being transgender (plan on taking hormones soon thanks to my grandmother). I've learned how to drive and plan on getting my licence soon. I've gotten so much farther in life living in a supportive home than I did living with an abusive caretaker. This is my story with as much detail as I can remember. I have recordings, I have screenshots and I have witnesses. As much resentment and loathing I now have for my step mom, I mostly just wish that she's treating people better now and that my sisters are doing well. It would be wrong of me to wish negativity onto her, despite everything. That is all.

fvsqs0,"Little brother (14M) emotionally &amp; physically abuses Older Sister (20F), Mother (51F), and grandmother (74F).","This January, my little brother (let's call him ZZ) started to lash out on me, my mother and my grandmother. We live together in the house and he is the only male figure after my father had passed away two years ago.

At first, it was purely emotional where he would panic from not being able to finish school work on time, loses a video game, or fights with his classmates. He would lash out and express how we are ""useless"" as we cannot ""solve his problems."" As it progressed badly, in February, we brought him to therapy to seek for guidance and answers. He was diagnosed with Anxiety. He was given medication and he was also required to meditate at home. However, after the session, he would hesitate to go to therapy ""unless it's a man."" He would also threaten my mother saying that he will ""kill"" himself with a knife if he has to go to therapy or tutor.

It had escalated to the point where he emotionally abuses us this entire quarantine for at least twice a day. For all the things that he does wrong, he would blame the three of us. If he sleeps late &amp; wakes up late, or if he fights with a friend, he would blame us by saying that we are ""useless fuckasses."" There are times where he would shout at us so loudly despite us calmly approaching what is wrong. We have received complaints from the neighbors because he would leave the house and shout for ""help"" at times. He would even shout things like ""stop hurting me"" and he would hit himself and shout in pain to make it seem as if we are the ones hurting me even though we have never touched him or said ill things to hurt him. There are even times that he blamed me for my father's death which is completely unrelated since my father died of cancer. 

It reached a point few days ago where he did the usual routine of leaving the house when he couldn't face us anymore and he saw me standing by the doorway to which he responded with ""can you fucking get inside the house? I hope you fucking kill yourself."" Later on that day, after he came home, he started banging the walls of my room and cursing names at me. I tried to help him as much as I can and he did reveal that he had problems with his classmates, but that I would be very angry at him if I found out what he did. So I asked why. Instead of telling me why, he started to shout and curse at me even louder, and my mom came into the scene. He punched her arm, and he threw a chair at me. I panicked but I tried to stay calm. He responded with ""You know the truth? It's great when you freak out, it makes me so happy"" Then he followed by saying, ""But when you're happy, laughing, or smiling, it fucking irritates me. It makes me so angry."" Then, he slapped my face.

We had already called our local government unit for Women's Desk, however, they are too busy to be able to attend to it right now as they are occupied with other things. We are very lost on what to do, and very fearful. I have already secretly recorded his abuses from my room when he shouts as a proof in case he denies. My mom tries to understand by saying that it is part of his ""anxiety"" but I certainly doubt it. What to do? (Just now, he twisted words and stated that we didn't leave him any lunch when in reality, we cooked just for him. We let him know calmly but he is still very angry. He just banged the doors.) 

TLDR; Little brother curses, shouts, and blames me and my mother for everything. He punched my mother &amp; threw a chair/slapped me few days ago. This happens twice a day and had escalated this quarantine.",shallowshallow,2020-04-05 22:16:28,3,695,24.42,90.95,14.05,1,17.38,14.1,93.81,60.29,23.74,18.13,5.47,3.02,0.86,8.49,0.29,5.61,3.88,13.09,8.06,6.33,8.78,0.72,15.11,4.75,2.16,2.59,0.72,1.15,7.77,1.29,6.19,1.29,2.59,1.01,19.86,2.3,0.58,1.73,9.5,10.22,1.58,1.29,2.88,2.16,1.29,3.6,3.31,0.43,2.16,0.72,2.88,0.58,1.44,0.43,0.43,8.2,4.46,1.44,1.15,0.43,1.29,5.47,7.77,0.72,15.25,2.45,6.47,6.62,1.44,0.72,1.58,0,0.14,0.58,0.86,0.58,0.14,0,0.14,0,17.7,5.32,4.75,0,0.58,0.43,0,0,3.17,1.15,1.73,0.58

fvt5yv,Today was a wonderful day!,"Today was a really wonderful day, the best my daughter and I have had in awhile. For the first time seems like forever, we got through the day without my wife yelling and screaming about something. 

Daughter and I spent the entire day together, from wake to sleep. I took care of almost everything — cooking, cleaning, playing with my daughter, job hunting, freelance work, laundry — while my wife sat on the couch and watched TV for literally 12 hours from 10am til 10pm. A whole day without abusive yelling and screaming. Just, amazing. 

And now, I’m suffering from a weird, happy insomnia at 2am, lying on the floor of my 5-year old daughter’s room as she sleeps quietly in her bed. Sure, I probably won’t get any sleep til 4am, it’s too hot in this room, and I have a critical job interview tomorrow afternoon, but it doesn’t matter. I feel like I may be able to do this. I may really be able to live the single dad life.

Sure, times will be tough. I’ll need the support of my friends and family. But I think I’ll be able to do this.

I’ve also planned to talk to a lawyer and see a therapist this week. Whereas I couldn’t see a light anywhere before, I see one now. It’s still faint, but it’s there.

fvtfkq,Am I being groomed? (Possible TW),"I’m a nineteen year old female and I just need an outside perspective on this because it’s driving me insane. The guy I’m talking about is 36. 
I’m not exactly sure which subreddit I’m supposed to post on, but this one seemed logical. Apologies if not.

So about 3 years ago I posted on a forum looking for something sexually, more in the aspects of bdsm. I got a response from some guy and it was straight to nudes, as in graphic video type nudes. At the time I said I was 19 then. However, it then lead to blackmail because he found out who I was and at the same time I told him I was 17 at the time. This went on for about a couple weeks, at the time I was having anxiety attacks because of it, and he knew this. It lead to actually talking about it and more into the realms of “consensual blackmail” and limits, soft limits and safe words. 

Now it’s been about 3 years, and it’s an on and off thing still. There’s no blackmail anymore, and he respects my limits and safe words. Here’s the thing though, he knows who I am, where I live, what I look like, has about 1500 videos of me, with my face in them. The catch is, after 3 years, I still don’t know what he looks like, I’ve never seen any photos from his side and I don’t even know his name. He’s sent me gifts and stuff a couple times. He knows everything about my life, he also knows my passwords to everything. 

Now after three years, we talk for about 3 months, everyday, all day and then I get bored or “seek out destruction elsewhere” and stop talking to him from anywhere between 3-8 months. However, he’s always on my mind and I give in eventually and the cycle starts again. It’s almost like an addiction, I wouldn’t go as far as saying trauma bonding but it’s close. 

At the same time, he has helped me. I have an abundance of baggage from other shit in my life, that he knows about and helps me with. But I’m not sure if it’s actually helping me or making it worse in the long run. He tries to help with talking about it, however it almost always ends up sexual and he says it helps by sexualising trauma? I kind of see what he says as the end all be all, like he’s “obviously right” about what he says because he’s “helping me” and hasn’t given me reason to doubt him. Is it common to have a clear state of mind, and then when a guy you see as an authority figure over you questions you about it, your mind goes blank and you just become compliant? Because that’s exactly what happens. 

Obviously I can’t fit 3 years of shit into a couple paragraphs but that’s the general gist. Any feedback would be really helpful.

fw01m1,Is this verbal/emotional abuse (slight physical maybe)?,"My dad is great and this doesn’t apply to him. This is about my mom.

My mom is awful but good at the same time. I don’t know if what she does is abuse because sometimes she says she loves me, she cooks for me, she cleans my clothes and things like that. A lot of the time she’s perfectly normal, except sometimes she does stuff that I hate.

When I was eleven she dragged me to the floor and stomped on my head. All for being manipulated and humiliated by a girl who I thought was my friend at school. She would threaten me with suicide and tel me it would be my fault when she jumps in front of a car because I was crying when I was like eight (context: I have autism and it was probably me being overwhelmed). I don’t know when that began. She would kick me, slap me, drag me around etc etc. I remember once she pushed me into the wall and I banged my head. Another time she dragged me to the sink and shoved water into my face while roughly pinching my nose so I struggled to breath. All while yelling at me. She told me she hated me. She doesn’t apologise.

She uses me as her therapist and tells me things about my older brother. Stuff like ‘He’s an awful child’ (he’s not a child) and just all about how horrible he is and even told me about his girlfriend sending him nudes, which I rather would not know about. 

I don’t know if I’m overreacting by calling it abusive because it’s not an everyday thing, only when she’s angry.

Am I being dramatic? Or is this normal discipline? 

I live with roommates now so it’s all died down but she still feels the need to verbally attack me for small things and seems to think she owns my body and my life (you’re never getting a tattoo, you’re not moving there etc etc).",101Badabing101,2020-04-06 07:49:50,4,343,3.99,29.97,48,1,15.59,11.95,93.29,64.14,28.86,22.16,13.7,0,0.58,7.87,0,6.71,3.79,9.91,11.08,7,9.33,2.92,19.83,4.08,1.75,2.62,0.87,1.75,6.41,1.17,5.25,1.46,2.92,0.58,13.99,1.17,0.87,7,2.33,12.54,2.62,1.75,2.33,2.62,2.04,3.21,1.17,0,0.58,0.29,4.37,2.33,1.17,0.29,0.58,5.83,1.46,0.29,2.92,1.17,0.58,3.5,12.83,0,11.37,1.75,4.08,5.54,0.29,0.58,0.29,0,0,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.33,5.54,2.33,0.29,0,0.87,0,0,0.29,4.37,2.33,0.29
fw04gx,I Live in Constant Fear of My Mother,"Context: I am a first year university student. I had to go home early because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since I got back it has been awful. 

For the past 2 years everything sets my mom off. A few days ago it was my dad asking mom if we could cancel the cable. Mom instead of just explaining that she enjoys the cable still uses immediately starts yelling at us, ""Why the fuck would you want to take away my cable! You are trying to fucking control me!""

Every discussion follows this pattern. Someone will say something which is not intended as an insult or to cause harm and mom will blow up. She starts guilt tripping us and martyring, ""I made you supper and did your laundry and yet you still don't appreciate me!"" This is simply not true, I try to help and thank her all the time. Then the gas lighting begins. ""I am not overreacting, you were trying to attack me! You are an abuser. An awful male cunt abuser, trying to bully a poor women like me."" Finally she moves onto the final step, insulting you where you are most vulnerable, ""This is why your girlfriend left you,"" or ""This is why you lost you job, because you are incompetent male bully!"" She will never apologize and never compromise. It only stops when either we leave or when she literally. One time it was so bad it would only stop when I cut my wrist and screamed about how I was a bad person and how I should been killed as a baby. Only then did she admit that she went too far.

I can't talk to her about when she is calm. She doesn't see an intervention as a group of people with genuine concerns, she sees it as us ganging up on her. She doesn't see compromise or admission of guilt as the first step to better relationships, she see is as ""giving in to misogynistic abuser,"" and that society needs to change for her, not the other way around. It's not true though and I am so tired of it being used to attack me! No one has ever laid a finger on her and no one has ever said anything like, ""you stupid women"" or anything that ever targets her sex. She lords it over us though, that if the cops got involved that they would take her side because she is a woman.

I feel so alone because if I turn to my Dad or brother for help she will say that I am working against her.

I am tired and afraid. I can't live my life like this. If I ask something with no malice or intent she screams me. I am in constant fear, and I don't know who to turn to.

I am not perfect, neither is my dad or brother. Sometimes we are the cause of the fight, but not recently.

fw24op,Childhood trauma cause inability to focus on a task?,"Basically, if a child is exposed to severe/constant enough trauma, can they develope a coping mechanism of completely cutting themselves off from the world, and ""stay up in their heads"", cutting off emotions, thinking, and making it nearly impossible to focus on even a single task?

I experienced a lot of abuse and neglect growing up, and now it's like i have no thoughts, can't think or focus on anything, and no emotions or feelings.

fw5gvl,Please help me :(,"Hi everyone. I'm 20 years old and apologise if this isn't the right place to post. Yesterday I stood up to my abusive, toxic friendship that I've had for two years and the friend left me. (Please see pic, they did not apologise). They've made me feel terrible more times than I can remember and their apologies didn't have any action behind them. I have fear of abandonment and watched them unfriend me. But now it's starting to sink in, I had an attachment to him and the story we were both writing together. I stupidly feel worthless without him even though he makes me feel worthless. I was weak and begged him to stay but he told me I made him throw glasses and punch a hole in his door. I'm fighting every instinct not to message him. I want to feel better off since he's toxic and only ever used me, hurled insults or just swore and yelled. Always managing to spin it on me. But beneath that, my brain will only think about the good times. The times where I should've kept my mouth shut and he wouldn't have left. I'm so hurt he could just drop me so easily. It feels like my fault. I wish he cared about me and I could know the ideas he had for our story that we'd been developing for the two years but he deleted it and blocked me there too which is so so painful. I wish he'd reach out because he thought our friendship was good, but here I am really upset about it all while he's probably celebrating. There are so many unresolved things and we spoke nearly everyday so it feels so horrible and weird not to. I'm thinking of just saying hi, sorry, anything. I have been crying a bit. I'm sorry if I sound lame. Please please any advice?

fw76ii,"Asking my mom again to leave my abuser, her husband.","I decided to write here in hopes of letting some of this stuff go in my head. My parents met in rehab and split after 5ish years. They had 3 kids and decided to give the 3rd up for adoption in hopes of a better life. We have an open adoption and we love her just as equally and love her parents. My mom got with my step dad when I was about 4. He had 3 kids from a previous marriage. Unfortunately my dad was an addict for almost my entire childhood. He did some really horrible things while addicted but is sober now and we have an amazing relationship. I’m a female version of him basically. My sister and I lived with my dad until I decided to move back with my mom across country when I was about 7. I always felt left out anytime I was around my mom step dad and his kids. He would get mad and yell at me about ridiculous things such as standing too close to the microwave. My punishments would be standing in the middle of a room with my arms straight out in a T for long periods of time. I want to say over and hour but I was really young and can’t remember specifically. It was painful and I cried a lot. I remember getting such bad growing pains in my legs that I could barely move and he was convinced I was lying and would move my legs until I screamed bloody hell for him to stop. I used to get whooped with the belt by my step dad and maybe from my mom a hand full of times. We moved all the time. Each time farther away from my grandparents (who are probably the main reason I am who I am today thank god). 
After they had been together for a couple years my mom found out he was cheating on her. I remember driving by the other woman’s house with my mom one night. She planned to leave him and we even left to go to my aunt and uncles who lived a few hours away. They had plenty of room for us to live with them and even offered my mom a job and enrolled me in school. For some reason my mom went back. A short while later they secretly got married and told me not to tell anyone. I told my entire family the following weekend because it blew my mind as a kid why they would want to keep it a secret. I remember the cops being called to our apartment multiple times and my mom having bruises on her arms. 
We move yet again and this is when the sexual abuse starts. I am 9/10 at the time. They used to drive me to school everyday because I didn’t go to school in my district. One day while my mom is at work and he picked me up after school he said I was in trouble for lying about a bunch of stuff I did. Somehow I was stripped to my underwear and forced to do floor exercises like keeping my legs held up inches above the ground for long periods of time. Spreading my legs in the air and putting them back together. Then he decided to start spraying me with a water bottle. I should mention that I started developing breasts when I was very young so at this point I was wearing training bras. After he decided I was done he forced me to take a cold shower. He would check on me every couple of minutes to make sure I hadn’t turned the water warm. I remember staying n my room until my mom came home and when she came to talk to me I got the feeling she didn’t get the full story from him. My mom and step dad had put me into a counseling group at my school for kids of divorced parents. My parents had been divorced since I was one, I barely remembered them being together. I don’t remember ever saying I wanted them to get back together on my own when I was a kid at all because they always screamed at each other on the phone and that’s just how I knew them to be, separated. I probably missed my siblings and my other half of the family since I only got to see them once a year due to living far away. Anyways I ended up confiding in my counselor what was going on and that got cps involved. I remember them talking to me at school and I knew they had gone to our apartment.  That’s all I remember about that. Next thing I know it’s time for my visit with my dad and I begged him to let me move back. He lived with my grandma at the time and has 4 kids to take care of. I remember him basically telling my mom that I wasn’t coming back. He has had custody since they split. Well about 7 months later my dad entered rehab. This was a very low point in his addiction the following few years. Rock bottom is what I call it. My sister had been shipped to my moms a couple months before after my dad couldn’t control her teenage shenanigans. This forced me to go back to my moms. 
That’s when we started family counseling. A lady would come to our apartment and talk to all of us for an hour. All my sister and I can remember to this day is my parents being fake and lying about everything going on in the house. My grandma across the country bought a cell phone for my sister so we could contact her when things got bad because we had no home phone and they wouldn’t let us use their phones sometimes. One day things escalated and my step dad ended up chocking my sister and burning out her SIM card trying to get into her phone. We were getting ready to move to a house in the country and for some reason my sister went to live with my grandma and I stayed with my mom hoping things would get better. 
A year later things escalated with the abuse again. I’m about 13 at this time, probably starting puberty. I’m pretty developed at that age and I liked to show it off a little because I was a preteen and thought that’s what made boys like me. I came home from school one day and my mom was in school at this time so she was gone. My step dad has a list on a notebook and tells me for every “lie” he thinks I am telling I have to remove an item of clothing. For some reason I did it at first until I was in just bra and panties. He thought I was lying and was trying to force me to take my bra off. I said no many times so he tried to force it off me. He has many pairs of those scissors emt/paramedics carry to cut off clothing basically just lying all over the house. He had me pinned against the couch and almost cut my bra off. I kicked and screamed until he backed off and I grabbed my clothes and went to leave the house until he yelled at me to stay. I never said anything to my mom because she didn’t believe me the first time. I know I had seen the counselor at my school but not sure if it was forced or if I chose to. I ended up telling my friend what happened and she urged me to tell the counselor. I ended up not going home after school out of fear and went to my friends house. Of course they called the cops to report me as a run away so I got picked up. When they brought me into the police station they didn’t even ask why I had run away because my stepdad told them I was just a troubled kid whose dad is an addict. I do remember confiding in the officer that he had done something to me. Next thing I know I’m going home with my step dad. I remember the officer saying to me that I could potentially go into a foster care because my dad was in rehab  even though Iknow my grandparents would have taken me in. When my dad called to ask why I ran away I told him what my step dad did and my mom finally knew the truth and asked why I didn’t tell her. I remember asking her to leave him and she told me she couldn’t because she didn’t have her license and was in school. Somehow my step dad talked me into going to the police station and telling them it wasn’t exactly true. He told me my mom was going to get a new job and things wouldn’t be as stressful and the family will be happier. Thank god the station was closed because he had brought me there after convincing me to lie to police. I remember getting confused about a question the officer asked me and I said something that was a wrong detail and my step dad used that to say well once they find out about this detail they will know you’re a liar and won’t believe you. 
My grandparents ended up “kidnapping” me after I stayed with them and sent me to live with my dads girlfriend and my sister before he got out of rehab ina week or so. My mom and step dad weren’t keeping any food in the house and not giving me any lunch money. We had no propane for hot water or heat. Living with my dad only lasted two months before we were shipped to my moms again so he could go back to rehab. I agreed to it if my step dad would go to counseling and they made me as well. Well months later we find out he never went even though he would leave the house acting like he was. They could never afford to keep me in counseling supposedly so I never went after the first couple sessions. No sexual abuse happened again after that besides one time he put his finger in my vagina when I said I was having pain. He’s a medical professional so I had trusted him even though he did that stuff to me and I didn’t realize it was sexual abuse until years later. 

Just recently I asked my mom again to leave him so her and I could have a meaningful relationship. My grandma is currently living with them after being sick and she is seeing what I have been saying for years. He has many serious problems and a huge spending problem that is taking a toll on their marriage. In all honesty I hope this drives the wedge between them or this is the eye opener to my mom. I don’t have a good relationship with her and I would love to have a better one. Luckily I have an awesome older sister and many women in my life now who have stepped in where my mom has lacked. With my grandma living with them recently it’s reminded me of how controlling and how much of a narcissist he is.

fw8gsr,Has my father crossed the line between bad parenting and abuse?,"I know it’s very common for victims of long term abuse to begin to believe that how they are treated is normal. After 19 years of living in a household with my father’s very erratic and angry behaviour, I am starting to confront the possibility that my dad could be classed as abusive. I’m also almost certain that he has a mental illness along the lines of Bi Polar Disorder.  

I’d like to make clear that he has never badly harmed me or my 14 y/o brother, but both of us have been scared that he will. That being said, the moment he lays a finger on either of us, I’ll be out of the house like a shot with my brother and reporting him to the police. I’ve always been afraid of asking anyone about this as I don’t mean to sound hard done by. I know a lot of children are severely neglected by their parents as well as physically beaten. I, on the other hand, have always had food on the table and never gone without. It is more just the way that I am spoken to on a daily basis. Perhaps abuse is the wrong word, perhaps it is bad treatment. 

I guess I should start by saying that my dad seems to have had a very shady upbringing. Stories he would often tell me about his dad would unsettle me; he would mention he was often punished as a child by being locked in the shed overnight, and it was made very clear that he was also physically abused as a punishment. From what I have gathered his father had a bad drinking problem. The strange thing about this and that my dad would never paint his father as the bad guy, and rather mention it as normal behaviour, or justify his own behaviour by saying that “we didn’t know we were born, compared to when his dad *insert in humane punishment he received as kid*.  The part of me that still wishes to see the good in him so much that I suspect he could be so traumatised by his childhood that he is brainwashed to think that he should bring us up the way he was bought up, and sees no wrong in what he is doing. 

Some of the my most horrible memories of his treatment of me and my mother are as follows: 

- When I was about 5/6 years old, I had a real fear of being left alone in the house, even for 10 minutes or so. My parents would never go far (we had a big garden beside our house, as well as a greenhouse which my dad would tend to, but you could not see much from the house.) Sometimes, when my mum was out with my brother. my dad would have a friend come over while I played with my toys in the other room. Occasionally , they would want to go for a cigarette outside, on the other side of the garden which was still about a ten minute walk. I would always ask to come with them so I wasn’t left on my own in the house. My dad would point blank refuse until I begged and sobbed, telling him I was scared of being alone, asking to just play in the garden while they talked. He would never let me, and would instead lock me in the house. I was so terrified I would often scream until my throat was horse, banging on the door until he returned. Because I was so young I couldn’t tell you how many times this happened, but I’d say at least 3, which stay potently in my memory. 

- numerous memories of him treating my mother badly spring to mind. He has never hit her, but especially when I was younger, he would have fits of rage. Once he threw the entire contents of a kitchen draw at her head (luckily it missed her). He would often destroy things in anger. I remember walking in on my mum hurriedly putting my beloved video tapes into a bin bag. My dad had taken them all out of their cases and destroyed them in a fit of rage. It was also very common for him to throw drinks in her face. I don’t really remember what these fits were triggered by, but I know there was a lot of them. He would spit and snarl and call her names. My mum wasn’t spineless however, and often threw names back at him. Sometimes, if he really hurt her feelings and crossed the line, she would slap him. It’s also crucial to mention that my mum is an alcoholic. She’s suffered with addiction for a very long time. Whenever they argued he would bring this up. Although I have insisted over the years that we try to find her help, he tells me that “she can only help herself” which I disagree with. 

I guess taking everything into consideration and knowing my mom would sometimes start the argument, I took a neutral view on this at the time and just knew that they weren’t getting on very well. Now I look back and question what in the hell could justify a fully grown man having tantrums where he would feel the need to throw and destroy things. He would also often put me in an awkward position at a very young age, asking me who had done wrong and to pick a side. He would then tell me that if I didn’t understand his side I’d end up with no dad. 

- on my 13th birthday, I’m not quite sure how the argument started and things are a bit foggy, but I remember he pinned me up against a wall and grabbed my throat. I begged him not to hurt me and burst into tears. He let go and told me how stupid I was to assume he would hurt me, and how I should apologise for hurting his feelings and thinking he was that bad of a dad. I told my mum what had happened and we stayed at my grans for the night. My mum told me he had crossed the line and she would leave him. We returned the next day to pick up some stuff to find him “crying” alone in bed. He told my mum he was sick and that’s why had reacted in such a bad way. I was then sent to apologise to him for hurting his feelings, and was told to forget what had happened. 

- if either me or my brother crossed the line, we were spanked on the rare occasion. I know there are mixed opinions on spanking because it’s technically not physical violence, but I personally don’t think it should be acceptable in this day and age. There are other ways to bring up a child without using this measure. I also to this day flinch at sudden movements. I was a lot worse as a kid though. I guess there’s a possibility that I was hit as a child, but was just too young to remember. I’d like to think that my mum wouldn’t have put up with this though. 

- when I was 9 years old or so, my dad was sent to a mental ward. Both of my parents are very vague about why or how this happened. The story I have been given is that he went to the doctors for a diagnosis on something totally unrelated and they told him he was having a mental breakdown and he was sent to an asylum without consent. This all seems very far fetched to me. I’m not sure what happened there but whenever I ask I always receive vague answers. I suppose it’s a very tender subject. He got a lot better after leaving the ward, and hasn’t had such an extreme tantrum ever since. He still gets angry every fortnight or so, but doesn’t trash things, only shouts and swears. 

What annoys me most about this scenario is that ever since leaving the ward, dad is in denial that mental illnesses even exists. When I tried asking go to the doctors after showing early symptoms of social anxiety in my early teens, I was told that there wasn’t such a thing and only people looking to get out of working or school would use mental illnesses as an excuse. I soon tried to swallow how I was feeling. I would have liked to think that going through what he did, he would go out of his way to support anyone with mental health issues, but it is like he has painted over what happened in the past. 

But anyways, skip to the present today and his behaviour is a lot better but is still very strange to the average outsider. 

- from the moment he gets in from work (5pm), he gets into his dressing gown and goes up to his man cave, smokes weed and only leaves to get food. He often doesn’t even eat with us, just asks that we leave some food on a plate to eat later on in the night. He doesn’t sleep with my mum, only on a mattress in the man cave but they have both mentioned that they only struggle to sleep together because of his snoring. 

- he rarely goes out excluding for work, apart from the odd dinner out. Every (I MEAN EVERY) weekend is spent in the man cave, day in day out smoking cannabis, apart from when we have family guests round and he gets extremely stressed about cooking dinner or tidying the house to look presentable. 

- on the rare occasion that we do dine as a family, discussions are entirely controlled by him. So when I say discussion, I more mean that it’s an hour and a half of him talking about something. Every time someone tries to contribute he will talk over them. 

- fights between him and my mum still occur once a month or so, and he still brings alcohol into the occasion, however he no longer does anything physical, but still calls her names etc. What concerns me is how easily his temper is set off. I mean, he could start an argument about a toothbrush being left in the wrong place in the bathroom, or the Hoover not turning on. Mum often tells us to swallow our words so we don’t aggravate him. 

- the most memorable for me is an argument we had in summer last year. 
He asked for advice on a phone he was buying since I worked in a tech shop at the time. He proceeded to speak over everything I said, correcting me and telling me I was wrong. I politely asked him to stop talking over me so I could explain. He told me that I was a stubborn Bitch, and no wonder why I had no friends if I was going to act so arrogant. The argument escalated form there. He had intentionally twisted the knife. I was at college at the time, and spent pretty much every day alone with no one to talk to after a severe bullying incident had spread false rumours about me around the whole college. He was aware of this and knew it would upset me deeply. I burst into tears and tried to leave the house but he wouldn’t let me, and told me that he would kick me out if I tried to leave. That day he called me all the names I could think of under the sun. Bitch, whore, slut, slag, worthless, you name it. I certainly wasn’t perfect, and wasn’t proud of how I reacted, but the way he would corner me and shout and spit in my face made me so angry I couldn’t help but react. I started to have a panic attack half way through the argument, and he started to laugh at me and mimic my weezing. My mum pretended she couldn’t hear anything from the bedroom. I tried to leave for about an hour and a half, but he hid my shoes so I couldn’t head to my boyfriends house to cool off. 

- I should also mention that up until last year, I have lived without a door to my room. Yep, no door at all. This door wasn’t intentionally removed, but the house was rennovated to add another room and so I was left with an awkwardly shaped archway that could not fit a door. I was told I would have one sized and fitted when I was old enough to need the privacy but never received this. This means that even as an adult, I often have family members walking in on me changing. I begged and begged to have a door installed as I got older, but was told by my dad that I would get one when I was good enough to deserve it. I don’t mean to sound entitled, but I don’t think that it should be a reward to have basic privacy needs. It’s not as if I was using my room to have sex or do anything illegal; I purely wanted it for the sake of having time on my own, and not having my phone conversations overheard. By last year, after turning 18, I snapped. I couldn’t afford to get a specialist door fitted with my part time job but bought a curtain to cover the entrance so I could at least have a space to call my own

- Several times now, whenever I’m sick my dad avoids me like the plague because he had an operation about 6/7 ago to remove a benign tumour in his face. The operation was successful and it never came back - the hospital does a check up every 6 months or so now to check it hasn’t returned, but he was told that the only thing that would be dangerous/impede his recovery was smoking (which he continues to do in constantly) 
- Whenever I’m sick he makes a point of telling me I’m “selfish” to go anywhere near him because “he could die” which is not the case. Of course I don’t go out of my way to spread bugs to him anyways. On a few occasions now, if I am sick in the bathroom next to his “man cave” (which is the only upstairs bathroom may I add) he has opened the doors only to scream at me and tell me to stay away from him so he doesn’t catch whatever bug I have. (Obviously with the COVID-19 situation this is a lot more understandable, however he has continued to attend his job and expose us to the possibility of catching the virus, which is very hypocritical. 

- I have now started to see patterns in the way he treats my brother. He talks over him very regularly, and often criticises him for being addicted to technology. He loses his temper with my brother at the slightest thing. When he was younger, he’d often tell him to “man up” and stop being a “big girls blouse” when he cried.  He tells him he’ll amount to nothing if he carries on playing video games. He tells him what he is interested in is boring. I had to split up a fight between the two  when my my brother stood up for himself once, and my dad tried to forcefully cover his mouth so he couldn’t speak, and then proceeded to push him into a wall (again, thankfully not hurting him. 

For some reason, everything fell on top of me when we had guests round for dinner recently. My dads ego is often even more heightened than normal when we have visitors round, and it’s common for him to make what he perceives as “playful” swipes at me at the dinner table. These include calling my lazy, unsuccessful, too dependent, and spoiled. 
As much as he thinks this is hilarious, I take great offence at this comments being made repeatedly in front of people I’m trying to have a conversation with. He makes me feel like I’m still a child, and also makes guests perceive me as one. 

I’d also like to point out that despite my upbringing, I have never reacted badly to things that went on in the household. 

I have always abided to curfews, never done drugs or drank underage, and as soon as I left college (with straight A’s) I moved onto a full time job, a £250 of which goes towards the house bills monthly. I have no qualms with paying rent, but I have a feeling this often goes towards cannabis and alcohol for my parents rather than food or the electricity bill. I am told plain and simple that If i stop paying bills, I have no right to live in the place. 
On top of this, have paid for my own food, clothing, toiletries, hair, makeup, etc etc since I was 14 and have never expected any luxuries to be covered by my parents. Again, not making my life out to be harder than it is, and most of this stuff is of course a normal expectation, however despite all of this, which I’d like to think is pretty self sufficient in comparison to some of my friends, who still expect pocket money for nights out and don’t work at my age, He makes out this all of this is untrue to guests, and acts as if he pays for everything, which really upsets me. He also chooses to lose his temper with me if I leave a glass on the side occasionally after a long day at work, and as much as I could improve on my tidiness I really don’t think I’m a nightmare child. 

I am torn apart and don’t know where to go. I have postponed confronting this for so long because I want to see the good in my dad, and a lot of people have it more worse off than me. Also, it’s not as if he is a monster all the time; most of the time, he’s just a regular old dad and still makes me and my brother laugh and treats us for Christmas and birthdays, etc. But he is just set off by the smallest trigger and begins to scream and shout. I know no family is perfect, but ours seems to be highly dysfunctional. I would die to move out and get away, but I also have a dream of going to university this year, and cannot afford to do so alone with the wage I am on. As rotten as this sounds, I need my dads financial support to go to uni. (He has agreed to do this and encouraged me to go; another reason why I’d like to believe he is not all bad). I’m scared that my brother will experience the same as me, especially as my mums drinking problem is getting progressively worse. Now she has nowhere to go or drive during lockdown, it is normal for her to be drunk and slurring by about 2/3pm each day. 

I am also starting to resent my mum for not stepping in and doing something sooner. She has also been my dads punching bag for many years but she has never had the guts to leave. She has told me many a time that she will divorce from him but never has in fear of not having the money to live alone, although She has a huge family that I know for a fact would welcome her with open arms to stay at theirs until we get back on our feet. 

I also partly blame her for not stepping in to tell my dad that the way he treats all of us is not acceptable - being beaten down years by your husband is one thing, but letting him do it to your kids is another. The minute I had a partner that did that to my children I would be gone. 

I guess what I’m trying to ask is whether my dads behaviour is out of order or whether I sound like a spoiled brat. I need someone to be honest with me so I know whether this family dynamic is normal, as it’s driving me crazy. Advice on how to progress about this would also be appreciated.",candyflossgiraffe,2020-04-06 15:27:35,2,3421,35.32,48.01,59.35,2.6,22.51,13.42,93.66,61.41,19.7,14.62,8.18,0.79,0.15,5.03,0.47,5.09,5.9,14.82,10.26,6.4,8.21,2.37,18.74,5.12,2.54,1.93,0.82,2.05,5.32,1.34,3.95,0.5,1.37,0.7,13.1,1.96,0.32,1.2,5.7,13.53,2.13,1.67,2.66,3.07,1.72,3.83,1.9,0.5,0.73,0.64,2.37,0.58,0.96,0.12,0.82,6.17,1.93,0.94,2.08,0.88,0.73,5.32,10.17,0.58,15.96,2.4,7.22,6.55,0.82,0.91,1.26,0.53,0.06,0.09,0.38,0.15,0.06,0.06,0.09,0.06,12.36,4.41,4,0.03,0.12,0.03,0,0.5,0.5,2.05,0.53,0.2

fwa8hk,Is this sexual abuse?,"I was in 3rd grade (7 or 8) when my older brother (11 or 12) who’s 4 years older than me sexually harassed me. I’m not sure if it was sexual abuse. To give some background, he was verbally and physically abusive when I was a kid because he was treated the same way by our older brother. I remember him punching me in the arm multiple times and hitting me. He would call me a cry baby, attention whore, and other names. If I wanted to tell my parents on him, he would threaten to hit me. My parents weren’t the most present because they were working so I’d spend most of my time with my older brother. He was like a frenemy because he would play legos and other games with me, but physically and verbally abuse me. Even now, I feel like I shouldn’t be considering it as abuse because I hear that it’s common behavior in siblings to bicker, tease, and hit.

I remember him asking me to come into his room and asking if I know how to do some sexual act (I believe it was stripping) or something related. I feel ashamed to admit that I didn’t mind doing it either. There were multiple incidents after that happened. I remember being under the blanket and he said I can do whatever I want with his penis so I was touching it. The next was when me and my friends were in the jacuzzi playing around, and he was there hanging out with us (non sexual). After they left and I was in my room, he came in and told me that I should repay him for playing with my friends, and then we dry humped. The last scenario I recall was when we were playing this game and whoever lost had to do what the winner wanted. I remember trying really hard to win, but I lost. We didn’t do anything because I think my brother realized it was wrong and everything stopped. 

The physical and verbal abuse stopped eventually after puberty so our relationship was better.

I totally forgot all of the sexual stuff happened until around the time my brother started dating his girlfriend which was when I was in 8th grade. I don’t recall how I ended up remembering but I think it was because a lot of people were saying me and his girlfriend looked similar. Although I remembered, I felt so guilty, ashamed, and disgusting because I went along with everything. When we hung out I would suppress all of that, and we continued having a close relationship. Sometimes I’d hangout with him and his friends or girlfriend, or with our sister bc I was close with them too. He would pay for my drinks and food.  

When I was a junior in highschool, he came home drunk (with his friend and girlfriend) and started banging on my door. I opened it and he went to lay on my bed, and wouldn’t leave when I was super pissed off to the point of tears. That made me have flashbacks of those sexual memories. But our relationship was still the same after that. 

We never talked about what has happened, and he has apologized for yelling at me and being an asshole to me as a kid twice (never went into specifics). But those apologies only happened when he was under the influence (2019). The next day after one of those apologies, we were drinking and got into a fight/argument. It was because he was telling my crossed friend to take another shot (my friend didn’t mind), but I knew she was already at a good level that she didn’t need another. I told him that she doesn’t need another one and then he started getting aggressive to my face saying that “if she drinks to the point of throwing up, she’ll not want to drink again. That’s what our older brother did to me so I wanna do the same for her”. I told him he was ruining my mood by getting so aggressive and that his logic didn’t make sense because my friend isn't one to drink regularly anyway. That’s when everything got worse, he started attacking me for being so sensitive and mocking me when I cried recently. He got so mad he went out of the hotel room to cool down with his friend. My brother messaged my boyfriend saying how he “felt a little bad for calling her \[me\] a bitch and not doing shit. “But she is because she only thinks about herself”. My boyfriend wasn’t even there. I found out the next day my brother didn’t remember the whole thing because he was blacked out drunk. He apologized but I don’t think he knows the extent of how bad it was. 

After knowing all of this information, I’ve been thinking about my morals. Before I used to justify all of those sexual stuff because he was young and because of my guilt for going along with it (curiosity), as well as how he’s not the same person. But now I don’t know anymore after talking about it with someone, my morals are shaking because this shouldn’t have happened to begin with. It’s just so confusing trying to figure out what to do. It feels weird to act like nothing has happened so I’m avoiding him for the time being. I know I don’t feel safe or comfortable around him when he’s drunk. Another moral shaking thing here too, if he feels sorry and is a different person now then why would he yell at me even if he was blacked out drunk that one time. When he’s sober I feel fine, but I can’t tell if it’s because I haven't fully processed the severity and strangeness of those sexual situations.",throwaway44444_,2020-04-06 17:15:22,2,982,9.63,45.15,65.69,1.73,18.88,17.21,95.82,63.24,24.13,17.62,10.08,1.32,0,5.91,0.31,6.52,3.77,12.02,10.49,6.42,11.3,2.65,21.08,5.19,3.36,2.75,1.12,1.73,6.11,1.53,4.48,0.92,2.24,0.71,15.27,1.32,1.43,1.12,5.91,15.78,4.28,2.75,2.44,2.55,1.32,4.58,2.14,0.1,0.71,1.22,3.05,0.61,0.31,1.22,1.02,9.06,4.79,0.92,2.04,1.02,1.02,9.98,7.54,0.71,12.83,1.02,4.79,6.92,0.61,1.83,0.61,0.2,0.31,0,1.12,0.51,0.2,0.1,0.1,0.1,14.56,5.19,2.95,0,0,0.1,0,0,0.51,3.46,1.83,0.51

fwd0l7,"27[M] I just learned that my friend [27] F was abused as a child, how can I help her?","True to be told my friend is also a love interest, I've liked her for the longest time, but she's super reserved, and has mental health problems so she basically can't respond to my feelings.

When we met the full intention of both of us was to make a relationship out of it (long story) anyway, as time went by I told her my feelings little by little realizing her situation, and hopefully not making things more difficult for her. However she's just stated that she isn't in a place to reciprocate at the moment. Which I fully understand and I'm not pressuring her at all in that aspect, I've decided to just be her friend for when she needs me.

She has a lot of trust issues, and doesn't trust anyone basically. So even trusting me even when I'm one of her few friends it's difficult for her. Since we met, she has never really spoke about her dad, she's talked mainly about her brother and mother. So I started noticing that something happened, and in general the way she is and she's been definitely knew that something wasn't quite right. She self harms and she's super depressive.

Turns out that I learned that she was abused as a child, she didn't tell me and she doesn't know I know. I learned because she told me she has been writing some things based on herself, and somewhat recently I was reading something and noticed it was hers and her story.  
I've tried convincing her to go to therapy in the past, but she can't afford it nor she is willing to because of the way she feels. I've expressed in the past ( before learning that she was abused that I was concerned about her and that I knew that something had happened to her and that I was there for her if she needed to talk).  
Well her situation is even worse than I though because it's been affecting her for at least over 6 years that I know, of self harming, super depression, anorexia, self hate. I don't know how to help her, being honest here I feel really strong about her, because she's just an amazing human being, and really caring about people and animals. She always cheers me up even when she's down.

I don't know how I can help her, and more now than ever that I know she was abused I don't know what to do. I'm putting all my feelings aside at this point and just focusing on helping her anyway, I've always offered my ears for whenever she has a problem, but doesn't even want to lately. Even worse, her birthday was today, and she felt so alone.

I'll listen and try to do anything I can for her so please help me out.",Gleam_Eyes,2020-04-06 20:18:06,1,492,3.74,68.71,22.48,36.5,23.43,14.23,96.75,65.65,26.22,20.12,8.54,0.61,0,10.98,0,6.1,3.05,12.2,11.99,10.16,9.76,3.05,21.95,6.1,2.64,2.03,0.81,2.03,7.93,4.07,3.46,0.2,1.02,0.61,19.72,0.61,0.81,11.18,0.41,16.87,5.08,2.64,1.42,2.85,1.63,3.86,1.83,0,0.61,1.22,1.22,0.2,0.61,0,0.41,7.52,3.25,1.02,2.03,0.2,1.83,8.13,14.02,0.41,11.38,0.81,5.89,4.67,1.02,0.2,0,0,0,0,0.61,0,0,0,0.2,0.41,17.07,4.07,5.28,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,5.89,0.81,0.81

fwfa1w,"Help me pls, I am human too.","I need help. I am basically staying in an abusive situation bc the alternatives have been more abusive and more harmful to me than what I am experiencing. Weather you believe this or not please if you respond understand this is reality and please reply with what you see as the better options are in my situations. 

I am being abused and have had a history of reaching out for help and not being believed. They do not care about my life or safety. If I am going to be abused or mistreated anyways why not stay where I am at? The alternatives have been much worse. 

I have tried living on my own only to be abused by roommates. Experiencing death threats or people physically abusing me. People sexually harassing me and treating me with disrespect. This has been nearly all my interactions. I really cant help but think its bc of my skin color and appearance and that just adds to the dilemma. If people really do not value or respect me enough that I can have a job and function in society why am I here? I am convinced I am being treated differently for being a female and for looking the way I do. 

I have many examples of being ill treated it has happened so much I leave my room only if my mom is with me. I think women should be treated with more respect and not gawked at or sexually objectified that is all disgusting. I don't think there should be excuses for people being sexually harmed. I am sick of the victim blaming. Why live at all? Why bother only to be abused and mistreated every day for the rest of my life no matter where I live it seems. It has been awful. The threat of murder and rape. People raping me or trying to murder me. Being labeled as crazy or like this isn't real bc whoever I am telling this to it doesn't happen to them so it must be a lie. 

Who the fuck would lie about being abused? Why is it that if I share my sorrows and troubles I am ridiculed by professionals. Why do ppl say things like oh wow go get help bc I wish for justice and fairness. This is all too fucked up. 

It makes me despise humanity. Joker shooting people and creating what chaos he could made perfect sense to me. People are monsters and they deserve to be punished. Why should others abuse me and think that is ok? They should be killed. I am alone without a community and the only way to survive is to be abused someway or another.  There is no way to live without being abused not that I see. No job or friend or family has ever been there for me. It is despicable. And since I am female and bc of what I look like I am expected to act a certain way in public not doing so could risk my very life. People are awful. I wont share my opinions on covid but you can put two and two together based on my disgust for humanity. 

What would you do what do you see from this? If its  along the lines ""I hope you get the help you need"" you are super dense and I will laugh at you. I am looking for a way to either view life so I can not kms or other alternatives to being alive and avoiding humans . Examples being an entrepreneur and living alone, remote work and living alone. Both I actively strive for but have been unfruitful so far.  I also am a human being I do want to connect with a few people somehow even though the majority aren't really my cup of tea.",furfoxandyling,2020-04-06 23:10:06,0,647,13.61,16.12,50.13,1,13.77,14.22,93.82,61.98,17.47,12.06,9.74,0,1.55,0.15,0.62,5.41,3.71,10.51,14.68,6.03,9.27,3.09,21.33,3.86,1.85,2.63,0.31,2.63,9.74,3.09,6.65,0.62,4.02,0.62,8.96,0.31,0.31,0.62,0.15,15.61,1.55,2.63,3.25,3.71,1.39,7.26,2.32,1.39,0.31,0.15,3.55,0.15,2.16,1.08,0.15,6.03,2.16,1.24,2.16,0.77,1.08,2.01,15.3,0.93,5.87,0.93,4.64,0.62,0.77,0.31,0.46,0,0,0.77,1.85,0.31,1.08,0.15,0.15,0.15,8.5,6.34,0.31,0,0,0.93,0,0,0.31,0.62,0,0

fwfuay,Do u find yourself attracted to people who share the same traits as your abuser? (Victim of sexual abuse),"Hey (20F) i was wondering if anyone else has this problem? So, i was sexually abused by a man in his late 20s early 30s from age 11-15 and then again on and off until i was 17. In every relationship i have ever been in they all share similar traits with my abuser and i find myself to ONLY be attracted to these types of men. 
..and also for some very fucked up reason i sometimes find myself actually missing my abuser? Anyone else do this? (i mean obviously i would never try to contact him, but still)

- example: my abuser carried guns, i like guys who carry guns. My abuser used drugs, i find myself attracted to guys who use/used drugs.

fwfvph,Psychological abuse: considering legal action,"It’s always been on my mind. More an idea of revenge. I let that go, I knew it wasn’t healthy. But more recently it has become about justice. I was psychologically abused by my now ex-step mom from ages 10-15. She controlled every aspect of my life, would invade my privacy, verbally abused me, gaslighted me, got physical with me and was overall cruel. 

When I finally broke down at school, a friend of mine walked me to the guidance counsellors office. That day we made a call to child protection services. This lead to the end of the awful situation. 

As a result, I have OCD, PTSD, anxiety with panic disorder and incredibly foggy memory for those years. 

I want to be strong, I want to advocate for myself and fight for justice for what I was put through. But even now, I type this crying, doubting myself and what I went though. I can almost hear it “you’re exaggerating.” “Stop lying” “you’re just being dramatic”. Oh how the effects of gaslighting plant seeds of doubt that never seem to fully go away. 

I just wanted to vent and also ask, does anyone have any experience with pursuing legal action? What did it do for you emotionally?

fwg79p,"Stop seeing victims of abuse as ""damaged goods""!","I'm a 26 years old straight female.

There are many people out there who label the victims of abuse as ""damaged goods"". Recently I heard something which angered me to no end. ""People who are broken/damaged goods/with past traumas/with emotional baggage are not worthy of commitment"".

I've read and heard that many times. My first sexual encounter was rape. I don't talk with anyone about my past, because I don't want to be pitied. Only my parents and my best friends know. 

I've been to therapy, I'm fine now, but I'll never recover completely from that experience. You can't erase those kind of things from your memory, you have to live with them.

I've tried to go on dates, but the hook-up culture doesn't make it easy for me. I can't have sex with someone who only wants something casual, without emotional attachment. I don't want to be used. I don't see the ""fun"" part in it. A lot of people told me I'm selfish and unreasonable because I want that. I don't think the need for partnership, affection and stability, when you give and receive love, is selfish - I need to get to know someone, to establish a bond based on common ground before becoming intimate with them. That's why some men I went on dates with started becoming suspicious: ""You have some unresolved trauma I don't know about and that's a red flag, you're not ready/worthy of a relationship because you don't want to have sex immediately"". I hate the pressure, but I don't fall for it.

 Yes, the trauma exists, but isn't unresolved. I went to therapy, I try constantly to improve myself as a person. I have a house, a steady job, my parents and I get on well, I help them and my friends when they have problems. But I can't tell them when I'm unwell. I don't want to bother them with complaints about the same situation.

I don't know what to do and I don't understand what I do wrong.",IRAisON,2020-04-07 00:29:08,2,349,19.01,23.69,77.34,1,13.96,16.62,93.7,58.74,21.49,15.47,11.75,0,2.01,0,1.72,6.02,4.3,13.47,12.03,4.87,6.59,6.02,22.35,5.16,2.01,2.87,0.57,1.72,9.74,2.58,6.88,0.57,1.72,0.29,12.03,0.57,0.86,0.29,0.29,15.19,2.87,2.01,2.58,3.44,0.86,3.44,1.72,0.86,0.57,0,2.29,0,0.86,1.15,0,6.59,2.29,1.72,1.72,0.86,0.86,3.72,18.91,0.57,10.03,1.43,2.58,6.02,0.57,0.57,0.29,0,0,0,0.57,0,0,0.29,0.29,0,24.93,6.88,5.16,0.29,0,0,0.29,0.57,2.87,7.74,0,1.15
fwgn8s,Maybe Tonight,"Go the fuck to sleep."" His face was facing the wall. I am lying in bed next to him frozen, with tears streaming down my face. 

Earlier that evening I kissed him and moved my hand lower. ""Not tonight."" He'd say. Over the last 3 years I had heard every excuse. ""I'm tired"" ""I'm hungry"" ""I'm too full."" We had sex maybe every 4 to 6 months. He just, didn't want to. 9 pm, his bedtime, guess it's mine too. We get into bed. I'm wearing my sexy underwear and I shaved my pubes and legs. Maybe tonight he'll want to touch me. Maybe tonight, since we dont have to get up earlier and his mom isn't home. Maybe tonight. 

I put my hand on his stomach, he pushes it away. ""Can we at least cuddle for a bit?""

""Here."" - he reaches his left foot out so one toe touches my foot for about 10 seconds. I sigh. 

I rest my hand on his waist just slightly so I can feel him while I fall asleep. He throws and elbow and it hits my face. ""Ow, you just elbowed me in the face.""
""Good,"" he says, I said don't fucking touch me."" I start crying.
""Stop crying and go the fuck to sleep. What is fucking wrong with you?"" He says.

""Can we please talk about this? I'm really hurt right now,"" I beg.

He turns around and gets on top of me and pins my hands down, gripping my wrists. I'm crying out in pain 

""Are you gunna go the fuck to sleep?"" He says, ""Don't fucking touch me.""

He gets off of me. My wrists are bruised for the next 2 weeks.

I go cry in the bathroom for an hour until I'm about to fall asleep on the bathroom floor. Then I crawl into bed. 

Somewhere between 12 and 3 am I wake up to him with his hands down my pants or him on top of me with my pants off. I'm caught off guard but at least he wants me. I give in. I let myself get into and get turned on. He's hard. We are fucking for awhile when he stops without cumming. He turns around and  passes out. I'm lying there. Pants down. Tired. Horny. Lonely. Cold. 

This happened for 3 years. Looking back I dont know why I endured it. Things got worse before they got better. I valued the consistency. The predictability. I had a very high sex drive that hadn't been unleashed and I was dating someone who didnt want to be touched or have sex at all. I honestly did not believe that there could be a better fit for me out there or a better fit for him, than me. 

Yes I tried talking to him about him continuing to try to bang me in the night after telling me he ""Wasn't in the mood,"" but it never went well. We were all wrong and communication was not fluid.

Years later we talked. He apologized for everything and how he treated me. He admitted to negleft and emotional abuse. It was will peaceful until he asked for me back and I said no. His anger hid behind the words of a text and he said things I will never forget. We will never talk again. 

I just wanted to share a piece of my life from years ago. I just wanted to say that if you ever feel trapped, it does get better.",itsjo_shmo,2020-04-07 01:08:55,1,587,28.36,39.9,81.62,4.74,8.51,8.86,93.87,58.94,23.34,19.93,11.41,1.53,0.68,6.13,0.17,3.24,3.58,14.65,8.69,6.81,5.45,2.9,19.93,6.13,2.73,0.85,1.7,1.36,6.64,2.21,4.26,0,1.87,1.53,13.46,0.17,0,0.17,6.3,8.35,0.85,0.51,1.36,2.21,1.53,2.73,4.77,0.17,1.53,3.07,7.5,4.6,0.68,2.21,0.17,8.52,2.39,1.36,2.21,2.39,1.19,5.96,12.27,2.21,18.91,3.07,8.69,7.5,0,0.34,1.02,0,0,0,1.87,1.19,0.17,0.17,0.34,0,22.32,10.9,2.56,0,0,0.68,0,0.17,4.77,3.24,0,0
fwhli6,Am i overreacting or is this abuse,"I needed to get this off my chest, it feels like my mom has been doing things to me (14) and my little sister (9) and i have been wondering for a while if the things she does are considered abusive, for most my life ive been thinking ""this is normal and happens to most kids"" but after i vented to one of my closest buddies, ive been wondering if this isnt normal. I know this isnt the best place to put this out here but i really need to at least vent. 

Sometimes my mom will insult us, call us names and such, like once my sister forgot to brush her hair and my mom called her a ""dirt ball"" and said she ""looked like a little orphan"" this isnt the only time too, like last week, i was sick with the flu, and when i forgot to brush my teeth, she said i would end up looking like ""a dirty hippy, and youll be ugly for the rest of your life"" this will be the most common things she does but what i would say is the worst is when she threatens us. Once my little sister didnt pick up her trash after eating and her drink was on the table, my mom screamed ""come pick it up now, i should throw this at your face"" i was in the kitchen at the time and i clenched my fist because i wouldn't let her do such a thing like that to my sister. Shes constantly doing things like this, we make a mistake and she flips out and threatens to do something, its usually ""dump this on your bed"" or ""clean this mess up with your toothbrush"" she never has gone through with a threat or even hit one of us. The only thing i can recall is when she threw a spoon at me, she said she felt bad but i dont know if its true. Usually after something happens i go to my room and either cry or sit there in anger.

She also has hypo-thyroid (low thyroid levels). So i dont know if i should blame her or her tyroid. And shes saying how bad her mom would treat her too, when she was my age, so i dont know if i should blame my grandmother either. I really would like some help, it hasnt always been like this she used to be happy and fun, but i dont know if its because i grew up or she changed. And i dont want to call CPS because shes still my mom, we still have fun sometimes, and i still love her. Plus my sister has a different dad than me so i dont know if we'll be separated or what.

My mom is also a big narcissist, she trys to blame everyone but herself. Shes constantly saying that ""if you were raised by your dad, youd probably grow up to rob banks or something"" which isnt true at all, my dad may have a rough past but he was there for me when she wasnt, in one trip to my dad's, he taught me more than my mom has taught me in my life.

TL;DR my narcissistic mom does things that i dont know if they are abusive or not, like insults and threats but never act on said threats, to me and my sister, and i dont know if i should blame her mom or her low tyroid, or her. i dont want to call CPS because im scared that'll ill be put with my dad and wont see my sister because we have different dads.",my_super_secret_alt,2020-04-07 02:35:57,5,621,4.8,37.96,66.23,1.54,34.5,8.21,95.49,66.02,25.44,19.48,10.95,1.29,1.29,5.8,0.16,5.96,3.54,10.79,13.37,5.48,10.95,3.38,21.9,5.15,4.19,1.45,1.13,1.45,5.96,1.45,4.51,0.97,2.58,0.48,16.1,3.86,0.16,7.73,1.29,17.07,2.42,1.77,3.86,5.8,1.13,7.41,2.58,0.48,1.29,0.81,2.74,0.64,1.45,0,0.48,6.76,2.9,0.16,3.22,0.48,1.29,4.99,12.24,1.13,12.4,1.93,5.31,4.99,0.48,0.64,0.48,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.08,2.74,4.83,0,0.16,0,0,0.16,2.58,0.64,0.97,0

fwixsr,My Parents,"My mom and dad who I love very much are really abusive and I just found out.. like a few days ago. I thought it was normal for them to like unreasonably slap or knee you and get really angry at you but I saw people talking about mental abuse and I never realized until now. I’m a 12 year old boy and I usually avoid my parents all day including my sister. I always try to have a relationship with my sister at least but she always kicks me out saying I’m distracting. Me my mom have good times as well as my dad but they get so mad over me “disrespecting” them when I am not. Sometimes I can be a smarty but it’s all out of good fun not harming anyone but that’s besides the point. I accidentally spilt my pop on the drive way but only a little and my dad said clean it up so I questioned cause usually it just drys up or whatever and he said “CLEAN IT THE FUCK UP” he always has random out bursts like this and so I did. We went biking the same night and when we got back our waters that were stacked fell over and he said pick em up so I tried and I don’t know why but I was sore and asked him to do it and he said don’t tell me to do  anything and I said I’m not I’m just suggesting and he said don’t talk back so I started and I was struggling visibly and he said you are such a wuss and teasing me non jokingly. 


I said can you please do it to him saying what Pussy you too weak to handle it. I finished and was head down about to walk back inside my house from the garage and my dad kneed me in the stomach and screaming DONT WALK AWAY FROM ME and so he yells at me and I run away to my room avoiding them. These kinds of scenarios happen once every week or so. My mom isn’t too much better I would attach an audio clip but I’m not sure how to add a voice memo. I came down stairs today to bounce the ball around 6:30 id say and my sister says stop I’m trying to sleep ( I’m in the living room btw ) my mom says Stop so I started bouncing the ball to the other room and she starts screaming and I say I’m just trying to go to the other room and she said no you can’t bounce I said sister while in the other room where the bouncing clearly wouldn’t bother her is this bothering you she said Yeahh I said WHAT so this took place after my mom lunged at me and I had to like push her off me. I stop and say I’ll just bounce it in my room she screams NO YOU WONT BOUNCE ANYWHERE IS THAT FUCKING CLEAR ILL TAKE YOUR PHONE so I say jeez okay. Lights on I’m eating chocolate same time same day aka today about 5 minutes after my mom says turn off the light I said can I keep it on because I’m eating chocolate she said idc I said just hold on I’m almost done then about a minute later keep in mind my sister has been chillin with the light on sleeping and trying to sleep and she said TURN THE LIGHT OFF I said I can’t I’m eating chocolate also you’ve been fine this whole time and then she complains also she’s 21 years of age. My mom then yells at me saying you think I like yelling at you I said yea mom you always do and she proceeds to say all this stuff about how I’m messed up and disrespectful and horrible of a person and I’ll grow up to be a bully and a abuser and she says I’ve told you things and I’ve talked to you for all these years and one thing goes out the other ear or whatever and I say yeah cause you don’t even try to help out our relationship and you just yell and take my stuff and I said it may of worked on you but if it has not worked on me for the past 12 years then maybe you should’ve taken notes. Then she’s like shut the FUCK up I’m talking then I said I KNOW then she ran up to me and tried to hit me which I pulled away from her as she screaming and spitting to which I respond my listening the running up stairs to write to people on reddit.

I haven’t been able to address any of my trauma from my past and it’s a problem in my relationship. I can’t trust, I say hurtful things, and I find it VERY hard to say what I mean.

fwpnh6,How did you deal with mental abuse from a parent? Have you forgiven them?,"This is a bit of a rant but if you have advice on how to deal with mental abuse from your parents once you've moved out I would be very thankful. 

My dad told me today that he regrets letting us live with my mom after their divorce because he cleaned out her house and saw the filth we had to live in for years (we had mold in the shower and she basically didn't clean anything like for example whenever the drain was clogged she just left it until I did it because I couldn't live like that I was 14 maybe). 

He told us he left us with her because she threatened to kill herself if he took us from her and I mean I get that she manipulated him and probably mentally abused him aswell but he just left us with her and didn't even und encourage us to come over on the weekends. Like my mom said shit like that to us too the classics are 'I will just go in my car start driving and never come back then you will see what you are going to do without me' or she just straight up said she will kill herself and my personal favourite when we didn't clean our rooms she was like 'rats are going to come and then childsupport will take you from me' but I was 11 maybe 12 when she said those things to us and this kept going for years.

I moved out 2 years ago but I just can't let the past go. This conversation ripped open so many wounds but I don't want to be effected by this anymore and I want to forgive them for their mistakes but I don't know how.",wuzeltabak,2020-04-07 11:21:59,14,309,9.29,89.05,33.52,9.74,38.62,11.65,93.53,67.64,26.54,21.68,6.8,3.88,2.59,7.12,1.29,4.85,2.91,13.92,9.71,6.8,10.36,2.91,20.71,2.91,1.94,2.27,1.62,0.65,4.85,1.62,2.91,0.32,2.27,0.32,20.39,1.94,0,5.18,2.91,11.97,1.62,2.59,2.59,2.27,0.32,4.53,1.62,0.65,0.97,0,1.62,0.32,1.29,0,0,7.44,5.18,0,1.29,0.97,0.32,9.06,9.71,2.91,15.21,3.88,5.5,6.15,0,0.32,0.97,0,0,0.65,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0,7.12,1.94,0,0,0,0.65,0,0,0,3.88,0.65,0

fwtixh,What kind of world is this?,"The dating red flags, the migraines, the beatings, the explosions that the person exploding says aren't an explosion. I just want these problems to come to a fiery and non-consensual end. I learned on our search divorce that a lot of marriages end in abuse, and it's by no means unheard of that husband beats wife, and it's not unheard of that the wife beats her husband. Whether it's physical abuse, non-compliance with restraining orders, stealing someone's clothes or keys until they give in to demands, substance abuse, or borderline cases of abuse such as lying, cheating, frequent yelling, and fighting over stuff, it seems like people can't treat their spouses properly. And then there's the kids. The parents usually beat the kids. Then the kids usually wind up in prison, in mental wards, and fighting their own spouses and kids and just generally living lame lives. When you hit your housemate, no matter how young they are, it creates conflict that includes misbehavior. If the parents were doing it for attention, they would become actors and actresses instead of electrical engineers and Montessori School daycare operators. They wouldn't come from all walks of life, they would come just from certain careers. And the parents are usually completely wrong for each other, so it's not some sort of individuality thing to stop cases in which there are too many compatible prospective mates. And the kids often flee, so it's not about fear of being alone, it's about the parents upbringing and substance abuse. In other words, the parents do it because they themselves are drunken assholes whose whose parents hit them. Your true protector is solitude, I often wonder if I want to die alone. On the whole, I want more to die alone then I want to not die alone. I have nightmares a lot where unredditable offenses are being committed, and if I had even a tenth of these nightmares, and I told them to you, you would tell me to get help.

fwtw7r,Don't know how to manage with abusive dad,"I(18) want to apologise because English is not my mother tongue 

 My dad(52) is always treating me bad( with words, he doesn't hit me or anything alike), he has been like this since I was little but things got worse when my parents separated(didn't divorce formally) and unlike my siblings I stayed with him because of some important money and university stuff,   this quarantine specifically is drying me crazy and I just cry almost everyday, being stucked in the house makes me feel down

The thing is that he is really easy to get mad, every little mistake like dropping a pen and not noticing seems like a reason to shout me, of course I must acknowledge that I'm not the best daughter ever, but I'm able to think that this is kind too much

Last year I went to therapy, but things didn't worked because as I told her the problems I was having at home, she'll after tell my parents exactly what I said, and that made them furious so I cut it

Today for example I said a bad word (in Spanish you can understand it like bitch) because of some trouble I was having with the internet that didn't allowed me to start the virtual course so after hearing that my dad screamed at me ""you're the bitch here""

Tl;dr: dad mistreat me and I don't know how to manage it, he would not change but I can't stand it anymore

fwwyjb,Looking for advice on how to tell my family I was abused,"Hi, I was in an abusive relationship for four years and I recently wrote about my relationship and recovery for a school project. I was physically and mentally abused, and didn't realize until I was out of the relationship. I've been lurking in this sub for a while and I always found comfort in being here. It's nice to not feel alone with trauma, but I've also felt like my abuse wasn't worth talking about, until recently that is. I spent months writing my story and doing research and going through edits.

I was really excited about maybe helping someone feel less alone or helping people understand why people stay in abusive situations. Whenever I tell someone I was abused they always ask why I didn't leave and I guess writing the article was my answer. Anyways, the article was published in my schools online magazine, and while I'm excited for it to be out there, I'm also terrified of my family finding out what I went through. 

The relationship was in high school, (six years ago) and I know my family didn't like him, but they don't know about the abuse. I don't know how to open the conversation up with them, I'm worried finding out what I went through will make them look at me differently or treat me funny.",bugcatcherfie,2020-04-07 18:18:36,3,234,24.14,16.28,99,9.85,21.27,19.23,97.01,59.4,18.8,15.38,13.25,0,0,0.43,1.71,3.42,3.85,15.38,11.54,6.84,9.83,2.99,23.08,5.13,1.71,2.99,0.85,0.43,8.97,3.85,5.13,0.85,2.99,0.85,11.11,1.28,0,0,0.43,14.53,5.13,2.14,0,2.56,0.85,4.7,2.14,0.85,0,1.28,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,5.98,3.85,0.43,0.85,0.85,0,8.97,11.11,0.85,14.1,2.14,6.84,5.56,4.27,1.71,1.28,0.85,0,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0.43,14.96,4.27,4.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.56,0.85,0

fwy07i,I don’t know what to do,"TW (probably): sexual assault, incest, and foul language

In September, my fiancé (5 years together) and I broke up. It was a mutual and civil decision. We decided neither of us should get screwed financially, so continued living together and everything was fine. We loved and respected each other, just recognized we weren’t the right people for each other. He was dating; I was dating (okay, I went on two days with one person in December). He was an ass and fucked an ex-friend of mine a week after the break up. Then another ex-friend two weeks later. He continued having sex with them and anyone else he could get his dick into and said he didn’t understand why that would be upsetting to me. That’s not what I’m here for, though. 

From age 3 (earliest memory) to 16, I was beaten, molested, and/or raped every single day by my father and one of my sisters. My mother was abusive in her own way, but that’s a lot to get into. The abuse continued verbally and emotionally through my mid/late twenties when I finally cut the last blood relatives out of my life. My ex knows about this. He’s seen the breakdowns. He stood by me in the mental hospital when it all finally peaked. He’s even met a few of them. He’s always supported me. He’s always told me I’m the strongest, most amazing person he’s ever met. That he admires and respects me so much because I’ve made a life for myself despite what I went through.

In March, a week before my city’s stay at home order, he raped me.

It was the anniversary of a friends death. My best friend and I went to his parent’s house to be with them. There was a lot of drinking and a lot of emotions — not least of which involving his mother telling me a child is responsible for their parents, even if they raped her. When I came home, I told my ex. I also told him about the good things — my friend’s father offered to hire me for some help with his company. I’ve been unemployed since the end of February, so I was excited. The next thing I remember is the rape.

For the past month, I’ve been stuck. For days after the incident, I strongly considered suicide, but even as I considered it I knew I wouldn’t. I’ve gone through too much to let this end me, so that’s not the support I’m here for. I have no job — not so ironically, I quit my last job because the abuse of my childhood reared it’s ugly head for the first time in 10 years and I feared for my life at my office. I worked from home a week or two before the CEO (who I directly supported) and head of HR started bullying and threatening me. I know I should’ve stayed and fought, but it wasn’t worth the effect it was having on my life. That may sound weak to some, but it felt like the strongest thing I could do in that moment. So now I’m jobless and can’t even file for unemployment because I quit. I’m competing with 10MM people for jobs. I’m running out of money and am — once again — financially reliant on an abuser. I know there’s the obvious answer of “go to a shelter” or “call the police”, but the shelters are full and the police would just make things worse.  Moreover, I love my ex’s family — they’ve been more of a family to me than my birth family — and I don’t want them to hate me. I also have two dogs and whether you buy into the concept or not, they’re the reason I’m still here. They give me something powerful to live for and they are my only support right now as I’m too terrified to tell any friends lest they attack my ex and make the whole situation explode. I love how protective they are of me, but I haven’t confronted him. At this point, he’s proven he’s capable of anything. I’ve known too many people like that and I don’t want to test his boundaries when I have nowhere to escape to.

It may be childish to refuse to leave my dogs, but he hates them and I couldn’t leave them with him. I learned the necessary survival skills when I was a kid. It’s just feeling extra heavy tonight after more job rejections, so little hope, and another tsunami of depression. I just don’t know what to do. I guess I’m just looking for ideas and maybe a little strength.

fwyoq0,"So after years of knowing I’ve been mentally and emotionally abused by my parents, my friend made me realize I’m also physically abused.","Because apparently having my parent repeatedly kick my leg that’s currently got a sprained ankle, smack my arm with the back of their hand hard enough to leave a bruise daily (even told them to stop every time), and them hit the sore wound (on purpose) on my other leg really should’ve made me realise this. 

Not to mention how my parent forced me to clean the house and walk on my sprained ankle the whole time (which I never got to see a doctor for) and all they’d do was laugh and wouldn’t even lift a finger to help me, except get angry and yell cause the house wasn’t clean.",ApollosRunner,2020-04-07 20:12:46,0,134,41.72,16.6,80.31,3.86,44.67,12.69,93.28,53.73,17.16,14.18,11.19,0,0,0,2.99,2.99,6.72,11.94,8.21,6.72,7.46,2.99,18.66,5.22,0.75,1.49,0,2.24,3.73,0.75,2.99,0,2.99,0,8.21,2.24,0.75,0,0,14.93,1.49,5.22,1.49,0.75,2.24,3.73,4.48,0.75,1.49,2.24,8.21,5.22,2.99,0,0,8.96,3.73,0.75,2.24,2.24,0.75,6.72,8.96,0,11.19,1.49,2.99,7.46,0.75,0,1.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.93,2.24,2.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.22,4.48,0
fwz1cj,this woman please,"https://www.facebook.com/brianna.manning.9

CPS has been called for years... she leaves an 11 yo to baby sit a 2&amp;3yo.
She flew off the road, hit a tree midair, and rolled... with a 10mo old in the car... she didn’t call 911 because she had no insurance.... and never took the baby to the doctor. The school called DHR because her eldest son told them she took his adhd meds. She bluntly talks about going through withdrawals. She’s been caught when pocket dialed screaming at the children calling them “retard”. 
Been seen jerking toddlers by their hair and arm when temper tantrum occurs. 

Children had pinworms and she wouldn’t treat herself...she dropped them off with their father and told him to do so...he called her out on falling short on responsibility...she threw a tantrum, snatched the kids up threw them in her car and took off because she knew it would hurt the father if he didn’t see them. While that happened she screamed about having the kids for “two damn weeks”!!!

Their father had surgery and wasn’t able to care for the toddlers...the day of surgery she was blowing up his phone to come get them. Their father passed out and Brianna was told it’s not safe for the children to be there and she said”ok, well let me know about tomorrow”... HE JUST HAD SURGERY......

She’s threatened to call the police and say he’s hit her just to get him arrested.

She failed to show up to even pick up her children up at the court ordered time...turns out she wAsnt even in the state. She was in GA in a pageant and forgot about picking her kids up. 

Even forgot to pick her son up from school...

But there’s nothing CPS can do about it. They do a home check and dead silent from then on...
Does she have to be the next mother to drive her kids off the road because she’s on Snapchat...before something is done.

The fathers and step parents are easily found on FB if any information is required.



She uses the children as weapons against fathers to get all the free time she can.


She is in pageants. She’s Ms yellowhammer in the Extraordinary Miss competition...and is an advocate for child abuse.....",NecessaryCulture9,2020-04-07 20:38:03,1,397,64.85,96.29,1.16,12.43,14.7,14.61,88.41,55.92,14.86,13.35,0.25,0,0,10.33,2.77,1.51,7.3,15.62,10.33,4.28,6.8,2.27,19.9,1.51,0.5,0.5,1.26,0.5,5.04,2.02,3.02,0.25,1.76,0.76,23.17,3.02,0,9.07,4.03,7.05,1.01,2.02,1.01,1.01,0.76,2.27,2.52,0.76,1.51,0.25,1.26,0.25,1.01,0,0,7.81,1.01,0.76,4.79,1.51,0.76,9.07,9.32,0.76,15.11,3.53,8.06,3.53,2.02,0.5,0.25,0.5,0,0.25,2.02,0.5,1.01,0.25,0.25,0,25.44,18.39,1.01,0,0.25,0,0.76,0,1.51,2.77,0,0.76
fx2if6,My father shit and literally killed me,"My family is really dysfunctional. My oldest brother is schizo-affective and my closest brother is dead. This has caused my dad to start drinking even more than usual. He has been really abusive the past year, especially when drunk. He has pulled his gun on the family more than once. In March last year, him and my schizo brother got in a fight. My Dad went to go get his gun. He wrote my name, his own name, and my schizo brothers' names on separate bullets. One each. He wanted to kill us and then himself. I got on my knees and begged him to stop. He said he'd make my brother smell the bullet before he shot him with it, and he told me he'd shoot me too. The next morning he denied saying or doing any of these things.

On the morning of Nov 19th last year, he started drinking in the morning. Somebody (who he assumed was the neighbors) called animal control on our dog for being tied to a tree and barking at his kids, and my dad got really heated. He went in the back and started screaming curse words towards their house.  They came outside cursing back at him. Somehow he felt he needed to go get the gun. I asked him it was necessary to do that, and he refused my request for him to put the gun away.

He kept telling me to be a man and that I didn't have balls. He kept insulting me and made me watch him handle the gun. He wanted me to see the correct way of how to be a man. While handling it he accidentally fired and shot me in my hip. I bled out right there in my own house. The force of the bullet spun me a quarter circle. I just remember seeing blood gushing out of me like a geyser when I looked down. I didn't really  understand what happened, and not a single thought went through my mind, only panic and extreme discomfort. I acted purely on instinct to survive. I tried to walk to a chair to sit down, but my leg was paralyzed as he severed my femoral nerve. This is when I fell down, still very confused, with the most eerie feeling of death creeping up on me. I felt myself getting colder and the screaming of my father getting quieter. It all felt so unreal. He said  he saw me fix my eyes on the roof and I didn't blink again. The  neighbors heard the shot and called police. My dad frantically tried to  stop the bleeding, to no avail. Later when I was in the hospital I saw the picture of my own pool of  blood puddled over my death bed and it was perhaps the most bone chilling  experience I've ever felt. I am truly blessed to look back on this  alive. Anyway, when the police showed up he was arrested for assault  with a deadly weapon and put a restraining order against him seeing me or going to the house. This was later dropped when I testified for him  while in the hospital.

By the time I made it to the hospital I flat-lined. One of my surgeons told me my pulse  came back very weak after a first round of CPR until I flat-lined again.  God made miracles and I survived after spending 2 months in the  hospital, receiving over 20 units of blood and undergoing 13 surgeries. I  spent Thanksgiving, my 21st birthday, Christmas, and new years all in  pain and on a hospital bed. It was a high velocity hunting rifle and I was hit at point blank range. The bullet was a .308 hollow point. For those unfamiliar with guns, hollow points are illegal in some states and usually used by law enforcement. They pretty much rip you open, rather than penetrating you in a straight line. The area it hit me is very sensitive, as my genitalia, femoral artery (2nd largest artery anatomically) and lymph nodes were all affected. I still have a hole about 3 inches  wide in diamater that is as deep as my femur. It destroyed my femoral artery, along with my femoral vein and many others. I lost many nerves and blood vessels now I can hardly use my quadricep muscles. Also part of my scrotum was hit and I'm blessed to keep my genitals.

He didn't pull the trigger purposefully, but his actions required the use for a gun, AND put me in the position to be hit by it. His behavior has slightly improved. He's stopped drinking, but he still has abusive tendencies. My current doctor AND physical therapist say I won't run again. I have chronic lymphedema since my lymph node was also destroyed. This means my leg is always very swollen, like stage 2 of [this picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Lower_Limb_Lymphedema.png/588px-Lower_Limb_Lymphedema.png).  I also have huge scars and large patches of skin that were taken from  my thigh to graft the wound. I don't have feeling and sensation throughout a majority of my left leg. If anyone wants to see I don't mind sharing. My dad tells me this all doesn't matter because people won't know and all that matters is I'm alive and walking (with a cane right now). This is really hurtful and I can't explain the pain I feel. I have become scared to live. People have become really really scary and I feel silly explaining this to family.

I hate feeling vulnerable and defenseless which is exactly what I am now. I already have a life-long history of abuse with my older brother, but now I feel like I've been completely broken down and don't know how I'll ever continue living again, with a new disability at that. The family seems not to care and my injury doesn't get very much attention. I constantly get told I'm not appreciative enough and there's nothing wrong with me because there are people who have it worse. When I take my clothes off to clean my wound my brothers shout at me and sometimes laugh. They tell me to turn around and face away from them or move somewhere else, rather than them just not looking.

Dancing was one of my passions. When I tried to explain how much I miss it, my brother made fun of me for ""complaining."" My pain medicine ran out and I was on my bed screaming and crying in pain. Later on my brother mocked the way I was screaming and my mom started laughing. A lot of things that Dr. ordered me to do has been neglected. I am supposed to roll my leg with a roller. I do what I can but my brother is not willing to help with what I cannot do. My brother even told me this is easy!!!! Holy shit I am so frustrated.

For anyone still living with abusers, please do your best to keep yourself safe, however that may be. It may save your life. I was always anxious at home and never felt safe. I knew it was a matter of time, and my own lack of action resulted in this. I don't necessarily blame myself, but it is reality. There is lots I left off here to keep it as concise as I can.",sYesh,2020-04-08 01:11:16,41,1256,39.48,28.59,85.65,3.28,14.44,15.68,89.65,55.49,19.59,15.53,11.07,0.16,0.4,3.42,0.48,3.98,4.94,12.5,7.8,5.89,7.09,1.75,18.15,5.18,2.63,1.43,1.11,1.75,5.49,1.51,3.9,0.64,1.43,0.56,9.87,1.83,0.16,0.08,5.02,10.43,2.15,1.67,0.64,2.07,1.51,3.11,3.98,1.27,1.04,1.59,5.49,2.47,2.87,0.24,0.32,6.69,1.75,0.8,2.71,1.04,0.64,7.09,9.16,0.64,15.13,2.15,6.93,6.29,0.64,1.11,1.04,0.16,0.4,0.56,0.32,0.16,0.08,0,0,0.08,14.57,7.17,2.87,0,0,0,0.32,0.4,0.16,1.91,0.64,1.11
fx2jih,Life advice please which of these life events are abusive? I’m going crazy!,"I swear I’m not an attention seeker. I’m just losing my mind. I’m going to list a few things. 
- my dad used to beat my mum up, I witnessed a lot of this as a child.
- my mum in turn would go crazy and run out the house and I’d have to chase her at 2am or she would threaten to set the house on fire and I’d have to grab the lighter off her. Once she showed me a handful of pills she was going to take. All of this happened around age 6 or 7. 
- my cousin and I fooled around when we were 7 or 8. She’s a year older. I didn’t really know what was happening, we watched a movie and there was a sex scene and she said ‘we’re going to do this later’. Bot females. No problems here though, we are best friends. 
- I played doctor with my friend who is three years younger than me and we touched each other’s boobs when I was about 7. Nothing sexual.
- first boyfriend, we were doing stuff and I wasn’t comfortable and he put both fingers inside me and I kept asking to stop and he didn’t and it really hurt.
-ok so my cousin told me a male relative touched her when she was 17. However it’s hard for me to believe, because she has previously been found to lie about accusing people of touching her to get attention from her boyfriend, MULTIPLE TIMES. She also said this after the found out said male relative was previously falsely accused of this and the girl said she lied. I was older though and I wanted to protect her, she begged me not to say anything, so I didn’t. I kind of wish I did? But half of me doesn’t/didn’t believe her and she always jokes around and acts completely normal with him. Nothing said since. 
- a guy at uni who was supposed to walk me home, pushed me up against a lamppost and gave me a love bite (gross). I was so drunk. When I got home, he lingered outside and told my friends he wouldn’t leave until he ‘shagged’ me, because I was so drunk. Luckily my friends told him where to go. A year later same guy was grinding on my in a club so I turned around and pushed him and he was super angry with me. 
- a guy I was talking to online filmed me naked the threatened to release the video if I didn’t masturbate for him. 
- ex boyfriend so emotionally abusive. He was so so horrible to me. He didn’t hit me but he did grab me and throw me out the way. If I did something wrong like speak to a friend he didn’t like he would scream and scream at me. He then claimed that he could do that because I didn’t do as he wanted. He also told me him and his cousin fooled around when they were much younger and he felt very guilty because he was older. 

I’m sick and tired of living with this.

Mostly little things, like me eating too loudly, or mad that I asked him to speak quieter when I’m asleep. I usually just leave the house when he’s angry. 
Recently, I was helping him out on the computer and he actually hit my hand/wrist because he didn’t want my help. It hurt for a few days after. It was the first time he’s hurt me since I was a kid.

fx3997,Child abuse,"When i was a young child I experienced a lot of physical abuse from my moms boyfriend he would hit me and my sister, really hard, and used tree branches to whip us and other objects to hit and threaten us with on the daily. Despite us NEVER being bad children or naughty under any circumstances. 

Our family struggled for money so we never had internet access we could only afford at-least 1 meal a day and lots of the time the electricity wouldn’t be paid so we had no light or tv. The hitting became worse and also developed into emotional abuse. 

Me and my sister (we are identical twins) would sit in our room all day and cry we would both lay on the bottom bunk of our broken bed and just cry. I remember always thinking to myself “someone has it worse” this isn’t good to think when you already have it pretty bad. 

We couldn’t afford anything for school however we both excelled academically despite society telling us we shouldn’t be able to due to our circumstances i think one think that helped was the motivation to create a better life for ourselves. 

A few years pass we were 14 and living with our grandparents when my mother couldn’t afford to pay her house so she was evicted and had to live with us once again so in our reasonably small house lived 9 people. 

We continue to excel at school , however im suffering with extreme anxiety and mild social anxiety and a possible OCD diagnosis. I dont know if my childhood has created these issues, however im determined not to let the past define me after all Thoughts + emotion + belief = reality, reality becomes personality (personal +reality). But as Kylo Ren says : “Dont let the past define you. Kill it if you have to, its the only way to become what you were truly meant to be.”

Also we never informed teachers / child-line or help centres of this because we didnt want to be taken away or live in foster care or anything.",euphoriaAJ,2020-04-08 02:15:29,0,351,22.91,81.91,61.76,6.64,25.07,17.95,91.74,55.84,17.09,13.39,4.56,6.84,1.14,0.85,0,3.7,4.27,11.68,10.26,6.27,9.97,3.7,19.94,5.41,2.28,1.14,1.42,2.56,7.98,2.85,4.56,1.14,1.42,0.85,14.53,1.71,0.28,1.71,0.85,18.52,5.41,1.71,3.13,4.27,1.99,5.13,1.14,0.28,0.28,0.28,2.56,0,2.28,0,0.28,15.38,8.55,1.99,3.13,1.14,1.42,6.55,9.4,0,11.68,0.28,5.13,6.27,2.28,0.57,1.42,0.85,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.4,3.7,1.71,0.28,0,0,0,0.57,1.14,1.42,1.14,1.42
fx3jwe,I am crushed.,"I don't think my mother understands the effect of the things she tell me. She is 50 but I still think that she is not ready to be a mother. 

I have never done anything right in her eyes. Every time something bad happens, she immediately blames me. Even without asking. Even without looking at it first. When something breaks, she curses my name. When my siblings get hurt, she curses my name. 

I remember back in college she told me that I'll never be successful in life. She said that I'll get pregnant early, won't have a job, and have a shitty life. None of those happened but her words were  forever etched in my heart. 

I made sure that I'd graduate. My tuition was paid for by my aunt. I supported my other college needs by working at the library in the afternoon and tutoring kids at night. By the way, she left us for more than a year during this time. She went to live at her friend's. As the eldest, she left me with 4 siblings to care for and a bedridden father. I asked for financial assistance from a relative. He gave me $20 a month. I managed the house (food, laundry, cleaning, etc.) while studying and working. She went back home after a year. Honestly, I can't remember how or why she came home. I don't know why I don't have a memory of that. 

I have come to accept that I am not the favorite child and that is okay. All I want is to not be ridiculed. I am not the most hardworking person on the planet but I sure pull my weight. When I got a job after graduating, I supported my family. I paid for the electricity and water bills. I pitched in for food and groceries. Now that they work, some of those were already lifted off my shoulders. What makes me feel bad is that every time a family argument comes up, they tell me that I cannot have a say because I have not been pitching enough. This always devastates me in ways I can't explain. I do not need to be thanked for my sacrifices but at least, please, don't hurt me. 

Yesterday, my siblings and I were having a friendly banter. We were teasing each other. She only heard what I said then came after me. Boy, she came after me. I asked her if she also heard what my other siblings have been saying and she said no then gestured that it doesn't really matter. She said a lot of hurtful words about how I look and my weight. All of those were fine with me. I am used to it. But what broke me is when she said, ""You are stupid. If not, then why would you resign?""

This broke me. 

I have been contemplating on resigning from my job for years. I have developed anxiety. I was not mentally healthy. Every time another work week is coming, I found it hard to sleep. I am constantly nervous. I was never lazy at work, in fact, my workmates and bosses had been telling me that I am one of the best. But the job became overwhelming - new administration and new systems. The pay and our work schedule weren't good either. I am constantly exhausted and depleted. I don't feel fulfilled. I am not happy anymore.  I want a better life and I know I could have it if I'd be brave enough to look for another opportunity. After lots of prayers, gospel readings, and tearful consultations with my friends, co-workers, and bosses, I have finally decided to resign. I found solace in God's words. He will not forsake me. 

My resignation was not easy.  I have found a family at work. Leaving family would never be easy but I  think it was the right thing to do. So I did it. Even though it wounded me.

fx3qtp,How do you deal with horrid parents?,"I don't think my mother understands the effect of the things she tell me. She is 50 but I still think that she is not ready to be a mother.

I have never done anything right in her eyes. Every time something bad happens, she immediately blames me. Even without asking. Even without looking at it first. When something breaks, she curses my name. When my siblings get hurt, she curses my name.

I remember back in college she told me that I'll never be successful in life. She said that I'll get pregnant early, won't have a job, and have a shitty life. None of those happened but her words were forever etched in my heart.

I made sure that I'd graduate. My tuition was paid for by my aunt. I supported my other college needs by working at the library in the afternoon and tutoring kids at night. By the way, she left us for more than a year during this time. She went to live at her friend's. As the eldest, she left me with 4 siblings to care for and a bedridden father. I asked for financial assistance from a relative. He gave me $20 a month. I managed the house (food, laundry, cleaning, etc.) while studying and working. She went back home after a year. Honestly, I can't remember how or why she came home. I don't know why I don't have a memory of that.

I have come to accept that I am not the favorite child and that is okay. All I want is to not be ridiculed. I am not the most hardworking person on the planet but I sure pull my weight. When I got a job after graduating, I supported my family. I paid for the electricity and water bills. I pitched in for food and groceries. Now that they work, some of those were already lifted off my shoulders. What makes me feel bad is that every time a family argument comes up, they tell me that I cannot have a say because I have not been pitching enough. This always devastates me in ways I can't explain. I do not need to be thanked for my sacrifices but at least, please, don't hurt me.

Yesterday, my siblings and I were having a friendly banter. We were teasing each other. She only heard what I said then came after me. Boy, she came after me. I asked her if she also heard what my other siblings have been saying and she said no then gestured that it doesn't really matter. She said a lot of hurtful words about how I look and my weight. All of those were fine with me. I am used to it. But what broke me is when she said, ""You are stupid. If not, then why would you resign?""

This broke me.

I have been contemplating on resigning from my job for years. I have developed anxiety. I was not mentally healthy. Every time another work week is coming, I found it hard to sleep. I am constantly nervous. I was never lazy at work, in fact, my workmates and bosses had been telling me that I am one of the best. But the job became overwhelming - new administration and new systems. The pay and our work schedule weren't good either. I am constantly exhausted and depleted. I don't feel fulfilled. I am not happy anymore. I want a better life and I know I could have it if I'd be brave enough to look for another opportunity. After lots of prayers, gospel readings, and tearful consultations with my friends, co-workers, and bosses, I have finally decided to resign. I found solace in God's words. He will not forsake me.

My resignation was not easy. I have found a family at work. Leaving family would never be easy but I think it was the right thing to do. So I did it. Even though it wounded me.

And that is why her remark crushed me. She knows what I have been going through because I voice it out at home. I didn't see that coming.

fx5p23,I think I'm in an abusive relationship and need help/advice on getting out.,"So me and my wife have been together for 8 years since March. Things started out well and I don't know when but things started going down hill.

Currently in the past week I can count at least 9 forms of emotional abuse.

Those include but are not limited to, not wanting to have sex, we're very sexually inactive, I actually feel afraid to try something spontaneous in case I upset her, and if I suggest we have sex later I get ""Maybe, see how I feel"" since the year started we've had sex twice.

In December 2019 I missed some bill payments because Christmas is a tight time of year but tbh I'm pretty bad with money, I will spend money I shouldn't but I also think, tbf, it's when my wife asks me to get something for her and I'm almost too scared to say no. So I've been borrowing money off a friend (only $50) and then immediately paying him back on payday, but I've been doing this behind my wife's back because I don't want to upset her (I know, it's rediculous). Anyway, all this came to a head and I came clean about missing a bill payment and borrowing money, my wife got extremely upset and stormed off.

She came back later still furious with me and basically gave me an ultimatum, either she takes full control of our finances or it's over.

So, I went into work and changed where my wages get paid into (her account) and whenever a bill is due from my account she transfers the money across, or if I'm doing the shopping she'll transfer me the funds for it.

Due to COVID we're spending a lot more time together an i thought that might be good for our relationship, but so far we've not hugged, kissed or anything even romotely romantic.

Weve played some games etc and spent some time together but nothing romantic at all, even when I try to make something happen I just get brushed off.


She will regularly make fun of my weight on a daily basis (despite her being bigger than me, but not by much), I got made to feel bad for finishing work at 5pm when she thought I finished work at 4pm and when I suggested that maybe she got the days confused she ignored my messages until it was 5pm.

Whenever I get home I'm expected to cook and clean, even if she's had the day off I'm still expected to do all this because she works more hours than I do (usually, without COVID, I do 35 hours a week she does 39)

Also she doesn't drive so I have to be available all the time to take her to work or go out shopping.

And she regularly makes jokes about my favourite things, so I'm not allowed to listen to my music or watch anime when she's around.

There's much more I just don't have time to cover it so yeah, should I get out of this relationship?

I mean I love her and I thought I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her but I think I'm starting to wake up now. Idk.

fx6uo5,"I feel like I was in an abusive relationship, but I am not sure and I feel like I don't want to victimize myself.","Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a gut feelings that my ex girlfriend was an abusive person and that I have passed some months with this person that destroyed completely my self-esteem and It is taking me months of internal works to reconstruct myself even if it was a short relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been insulted almost daily on every aspect of my life, and any passion, aspect of personality, way of doing things, my tastes, my phisical appearance (even though I'm completely fine with my looking, but i was looking at myself as ugly, and actually the stress was making me ugly). Many aspects and even the good qualities were ridiculized and insulted in normal or aggressive ways. I have been considered weak and unworthy, still sometimes the relationship was normal and that's what kept me there for a while, until I was so empty that she couldn't make use of me anymore for her own gratification.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been then dumped (actually I did, but she wanted to end it). 

It is terrible, I can't remember even all of the things I went through, I remember having always this bad feeling inside me, I was destroying my teeth for the anxiety and all. I never had such relationship with someone, and many may argue ""It's your fault because you let them"". Well, I wouldn't be able to treat someone so badly and say all these bad things to them, even if I don't like them. And yes, you are weak when you are in love, so what you do?   


Only because I am a man I have to be strong and resist all this shit? If a woman get punched by a man do you say it's their fault because they could have left him?   


My self esteem has been destroyed and the break up was terrible, I don't know even why I am doing this post. I am always scared of sounding like im playing the victim role, but I am trying to do a post to let these things out.",GoldenGrouper,2020-04-08 06:53:46,6,371,7.11,27.67,65.87,1,26.5,14.29,95.15,64.69,22.91,15.9,11.86,0,1.62,1.08,1.35,7.01,4.31,9.7,14.82,6.2,9.43,2.16,21.83,4.31,1.08,1.08,0,2.43,10.78,2.96,7.82,0.81,3.5,0.27,10.24,0,0.27,1.08,0.81,14.29,2.43,1.89,2.16,3.23,2.96,3.5,2.96,0.81,0.81,1.08,2.43,0.81,0.81,0.27,0.27,7.55,1.89,1.08,2.7,0.81,1.08,6.2,11.32,0.54,8.89,0.81,3.5,3.77,0.54,0.27,0,0,0,0,1.08,0.27,0,0.27,0.27,0,17.79,2.96,5.93,0,1.62,0.81,0,0.27,0.54,2.96,1.08,1.62
fx8m76,I (20F) am being emotionally abused by my (27M )fiance,"I'm a first time redditor, and posting this as my first story is not what i wanted to post but let me get on with the story.

I(20F) have been with my fiance(26M) for about a year and when we first started dating things were so well and it was going great until I made the mistake of cheating on him. I have never cheated on anyone and while this is not an excuse I told him what happened from what i can remember. I have a really bad memory ever since I was a kid and was diagnosed with depression. I told him everything I can remember and he told me he forgives me and I told him I will never do that again and try to win that trust back, and we left it in the past and moved on, or so I thought.

Fast forward a couple of months into the relationship, I snooped on his phone just for fun and wasn't looking for anything, and I noticed he was looking up escort sites and while I had no reason to look into his phone.I confronted him about and he said he was ''he was curious''. We left it at that and continued on with our lives. Fast forward couple of more months and i noticed he looked up his ex from years ago on his facebook account, so I asked why did he look her up and he said he was curious and while I was angry, i thought more about it and thought '' he was curious we all are''. More things start to pop off on his phone and one day he turned on his phone and the first thing we see is a tab about escorts,again. I confronted him about this upset and very angry and he told me that ''I'm blowing this out of proportion''. When we got in to arguments he would always bring up the past while i would be quiet and take the insults. at one point I exploded and long story short he said he was gonna change. I also found out he looked her up again for the third time on another account, and I confronted him saying that this is not cool and It's disrespectful and that why is he still looking her up, and he tried t make it sound like I was the crazy one and that once again, I was blowing this way out of proportion and he said he'll never do it again. I started to trust him he wouldn't look her up again. I also found out he has a lot of sex dating sites emailing him and he also made a account on one of them and when I checked to see if this account was from years ago it showed messaged from a couple of days ago he made the account.(to be precise,he made it 23 days ago when he made the account).

We had another argument where he was looking at these pages on social media and he knows that those kind of things have traumatized me and i have asked him before to please respect me and to not follow them. he said he wont and he did it a second, and third time. We had a big argument and we said what we said and he started to tell me afterwards that i deserve someone better and I told him if he wants me in his life that he is gonna have to change his toxic ways and after that I started to see little changes and i finally thought he wants to become a better person.

Fast forward to this week, i found out he looked up his ex again and I decided that i would check his phone because something in my gut was telling me to check. I checked and to my surprise, he logged onto a very old account ,looked up multiple girls, . When I saw that, my heart sank and i felt betrayed, and disrespected. I confronted him about it and immediately he started to ignore me and started to say he doesn't have time for this. He would not give me an answer. He kept on saying that I am always starting these arguments and that I'm always making it about me and that I'm ''self centered'' when I have the proof. He said that I was a slut and a whore because of the mistake that I made. I'm at my wits end and while I still love him, this is all to much emotional and mental abuse to the point that if i speak out on how he is treating me, he will get pissed and debunk my feelings. I can't talk about these thing to my close friends because he will degrade me and expects me to deal with this alone.

I would really appreciate your guys thoughts, suggestions, and answers. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

fxbr9q,I witnessed ongoing physical abuse as a child and the guilt is eating me from the inside,"Actually writing this down is harder than I thought it’d be. My mom had a lot of issues growing up. My dad was working a lot, so she was home with my older sister and I. I think she was super depressed and she didn’t have enough support. Whatever it was, she took it out on my sister. My memories are still all over the place but one minute everything would be fine and the next she would start beating my older sister. She would pull hair, sometimes stab or beat her with household objects, and she would scream horrible, hurtful things. Sometimes she would wait until night time or when I went to school. My sister would sometimes stay home to wait for the bruises or scratches to heal and then she’d wear turtle necks. 

My mom never laid a hand on me. She would play favorites. And now that we’re older and my sister left home (she’s married now and got a degree in psychology) my mom pretends like nothing happened. I finally told my dad the other day about what happened...and nothing. He apologized and said he didn’t know. But nothing else happened. 

My sister and I are still super close. And I can’t help but feel like I’ve done something horrible to her. She is the kindest person on this whole screwed up planet. And each time our mom broke her down with the abuse I did nothing. When I tried to stop it the first few times my mom just threatened to beat her more. But I still regret not doing more. 

The guilt gets worse every day. I don’t want to resort to self-harm as a means to cope with this pain.

fxc2vf,I mentioned my abuse to someone i thought i could trust and it turned out horribly,"I was talking to someone on Discord, it was someone who was kind to me before and we had conversations. In the most recent of those, we were talking about random things and the convo shifted to religion, he mentioned that he was okay with anything except if it was something attacking his religion.

I was curious and asked what was his religion, ""I'm jewish"" he responded, i said i respected jewish religion and culture, but that i had an issue with circumcision and he said ""yeah i never understood that but that's something we do"".

Then i said ""but well, many religions do harm to children unfortunately"", and i briefly mentioned the mental and physical abuse i went through in the cult i was born into.

I was not over detailing, i think, but he said ""i'll cut you right here, this is some heavy stuff and I just met you""

VERY IMPORTANT: i understand where he came from and i understand how people wouldn't wanna know about these things, but the many years of abuse i went through screwed up my social skills a bit,.

And, that sole commentary made me instantaneously feel like some kind of monster, i always seek the approval of my peers and i felt like it was a blade through my heart, and that sort of thing happened before, but this time, i tried to apologize and say: ""you know i understand but i think you should treat victims of abuse in a more sensible way, maybe just say i'm sorry for the abuse you went through but i it's a heavy subject and i don't wanna hear about it"", i'd have felt so much better and we even could've moved on to another subject...

In a way, i felt better for speaking up and trying to conscientize him that he should treat other abuse survivors with more understandingness.

fxh4cv,Is my mother poisoning my food on purpose?,"So, it's quarantine, and I think I have COVID 19. I had sleep inversion, paranoia, do a dry cough, lethargy, and a headache. However, my mother is cooking most of the food, and she seems to not get that my migraines are lasting and serious harm. She's one of these new agey types, and insists migraines are because of hunger or thirst. She claims that I can eat almost any food, and resists the notion that there are foods I can't eat. My father is away in another County, and he encouraged this belief, claiming to her when I overheard him that I'm just trying new behaviors.

Yesterday, I found shrimp paste on the counter. She said it wasn't shrimp paste, and after looking at the ingredients list, I told her she was lying.

fxhsuf,I'm scared of my husband.,"He is emotionally abusive. I told him I want a divorce but there is no way I can leave because of the housing crisis here and we have a daughter. 
He is constanly pushing my limits because he knows I can't leave. It is getting worse and worse. Today was really bad, he was screaming at me while my daughter was there as well. She was panicking and crying and yelling to stop. (She is 9) 
He almost never yells, but this time he was and I looked into his eyes and they just changed and his face changed like I have never seen it before, so much anger. I'm afraid the emotional abuse will turn into physical abuse.          

Also I can't see my parents anymore. It's my dads birthday soon and I want to visit him but he wont let me and I'm just scared I won't ever see them anymore. I can't tell my parents what's going on because they would immediately come over to get me and my daughter but my husband is dangerous, he will hurt them (and this sounds stupid but I really beliebe he would kill them) so I don't want to get them involved.

fxlyoa,My dad hit me for the first time...,"Hey,

I never thought I would write this in my life. He was my best friend and my only family support. My mom is abusive and I have a lot of trauma and abandonment issues from her. I loved him so much, and I still do. But now I'm afraid for my safety. I'm 21, a college student, I live with him, and I work part time.

It all happened because I got take-out and didn't wipe down the box. I know hes uncomfortable by it but he never said I couldn't. With all this pandemic I know he is very anxious and just wants a sense of control because he wants to keep us safe but its so uncalled for to take it out on me. We got in a small fight, no yelling, but I got frustrated and decided to throw away the food I got because I felt like it would solve the issue at hand. But it didnt. He grabbed a bag and said he couldn't take me anymore and left.

This triggered my childhood trauma and abandonment issues and I was in a bad headspace. I was a little suicidal, but I tried reaching out to friends and redirecting my focus to homework and my cat. I had a glass of wine because I didn't expect him to come back.

He came back around 9pm. And was knocking hard on the door. I asked if I could bring him anything and he kept insisting on coming in and I was scared cause he sounded angry so I barricaded the door with a chair. Then he was banging harder, and harder, and eventually broke the door frame off. I was terrified and drunk and he was yelling at me and flipped a table. I dont remember much, but I never provoked him. I never called him names or hit him or threatened him....I did say he abandons his kid just like my mom, but what made him violent was when I said I would kill myself

He pinned me to the wall, slapped me. Choking me and yelling in my face saying I don't do anything and he doesn't ask anything of me except to wipe the container. Later he threw me on the ground and held me there and I was yelling to kill me and I was out of my mind because I didnt know why he was doing this to me. I was heartbroken..

He pinned me twice more. To the drier and the oven, choking me and I couldnt breathe and I asked him to get off so many times. He put me in a headlock at some point too. I admit...I grabbed a knife to hurt myself but I didnt do anything I was just frozen with it. I threw down glass bottles at some point too because I felt so lost. But that made him violent.

He eventually called the police on me because I was suicidal..and they took me away.

And now my life is ruined. I just got out of the mental hospital and had a friend helped me to grab my stuff and cat to go stay at a friend's until I figure out what to do. Because of him I will owe over $2000 in hospital bills, I will be behind in school, Ive lost my only stability, I missed work, and I may or may not have to take back the cat I've waited five years to finally get.

What do I do?? I loved him so much....but that was completely uncalled for and now I feel unsafe around him. I told my friends I will stay away for a few weeks...and maybe fix our relationship or move out. But I feel like its not my responsibility to fix what happened. Im so lost...he was my only stability...",TinyToadies,2020-04-08 21:40:24,10,658,12.68,14.02,83.1,1,16.05,12.31,93.62,64.89,24.92,21.28,15.05,0.46,0,5.62,0.15,3.65,4.56,11.85,8.97,5.78,10.94,2.74,20.82,2.89,1.37,0.91,0.76,1.82,5.93,0.91,5.02,0.91,1.98,1.67,10.33,0.61,0.61,0.46,5.62,12.31,2.13,2.43,1.67,2.28,1.06,3.8,3.8,0,1.52,2.13,2.28,0.46,1.06,0,0.46,6.84,1.67,1.37,1.52,1.98,0.76,9.27,8.36,1.82,13.07,1.82,7.9,4.1,1.37,0.46,0.91,0.3,0,0.61,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,14.59,9.73,2.74,0,0,0.3,0,0.15,0,1.52,0,0.15
fxmcgz,My mom is planning suicide and I’m honestly so happy.,"My entire life my mom has abused me and my sibling relentlessly.  Mentally, physically, and verbally. I’ve never gotten a break. When my grandfather died, it was just me and my mom. Both of my sisters moved out and I’ve been dealing with her every day since. I got diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety in middle school and it’s only gotten worse. Because of quarantine I’ve had no escape from my mom. I hear her on the phone telling lies about me to my family, so I’m isolated from everyone who could help me. My mom plays the victim card and says I’m the one who’s awful to her. Since quarantine I’ve gotten unbelievably depressed. I can’t force myself to sleep but I can’t even get out of bed, I just lay there for hours. I’ve done no school work and my room is a total mess. I either binge eat the whole day, or I can’t even look at food without feeling sick. Today I snapped, and for the first time in a while I confronted my mom. I recorded all of it, her blaming me, her sudden bursts of screaming and cussing. I wasn’t calm but I tried not to raise my voice and I just wanted my point to come across. She just said I need to shut the fuck up and go to sleep. I went to my room and just say against the door and then I heard her call my aunt. She told her about our argument but twisted the whole thing making me seem awful again. She said terrible things about me that were just lies and so hurtful. I sat there hoping it’d end soon. I considered running away or just killing my self. Then I heard her say this “I’m not good enough anymore. At this point I’ll throw myself off an over pass in front of a truck and just let it hit me. I know I’m going to hell. I deserve it too. I know I’m going to hell so I shouldn’t let myself suffer anymore.” She started going on about how much she hated her life. I felt happy. I feel terrible about that but I felt so calm and happy. My mom doesn’t deserve to have the life she’s been gifted with. She’s been abusive and she’s hurt me and my family so much and I hate her. I know it’s terrible for me to want her to kill herself. She’s my mom and it’s so evil for me to wish that on her. But I’m so tired of being scared of my own mom. I’m tired of being so alone and the only one here is someone who hates me. I know I’ll probably be in hell with her, but her suicide would make my life so much better. I could live with my sister and finally get a job and go to drivers ed and have a boyfriend. My life has been so limited and empty that I wish she would go through with it. I know it’s bad but I want her to kill herself. 




TLDR:; I’ve been abused by my mom and because I’ve been so depressed because of quarantine she’s been even more mean than usual. She screamed at me and I told her how I felt and later she told my aunt how much she hated me but then started saying she wanted to kill her self. I wish she would and I feel bad about it",throwaway_whore666,2020-04-08 22:09:57,6,597,6.61,19.19,75.43,1,13.57,10.55,96.31,61.81,26.63,22.28,16.25,0.17,0,5.86,0,4.36,2.85,11.56,9.72,7.37,10.72,2.01,22.28,4.69,1.17,1.17,0.5,2.18,9.38,1.68,7.71,0.34,3.35,1.51,13.4,3.02,0.17,8.21,0.34,11.56,2.51,1.84,2.51,1.01,1.01,3.35,3.69,0.17,2.18,1.34,2.85,0.34,2.01,0.17,0.5,5.03,1.34,1.17,0.84,1.34,0.67,6.2,12.23,2.35,11.39,2.35,4.52,4.36,0.67,0.67,1.01,0,0.5,1.17,0.84,0.67,0.17,0,0,0,15.24,7.2,1.68,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0.34,5.7,0,0
fxmkpo,Letting go,"What does it mean to let go? Do I create my life revolving around some sort of “Phoenix from the ashes?” Someone greater and stronger because of abuse? If my abuse is what makes me the best version of myself, then have I really let go? Doesn’t that mean it’s always a part of you? 

 Or is letting go forgetting? Being unbothered by? Disassociating yourself from your abuse? Is there really such thing as truly letting go?

fxmyfj,My friend is making the biggest mistake of her life,"In grad school I met *S* she has definitely struggled with guys and we have had lots of long conversations about these struggles. 

*S* is currently dating a man called *T* at this point they have been together for 1.5 years. They are both 30 and really want their own kids in addition to *T’s* kids from a previous relationship. A month ago *S* shared that she was pretty sure that she was going to leave *T* for several reasons 

•He is extremely jealous of any man she is nice to (e.g., the bank teller). Keep in mind *S* has never cheated or been unfaithful. 

•He is controlling (e.g., will not let her spend time with her friends because he is afraid she will cheat on him) 

•*S* believes *T* has untreated PTSD from his time in the military, when she has discussed this with him/asked him to get treatment he has refused. 


This all lines up with my only interaction with *T*. In this interaction both *S* and *T* came to my apartment to pick up an extra piece of furniture. My boyfriend  and I assumed that *S* and *T* would come over, we would move the furniture and then drink a beer or have a snack and socialize. Unfortunately, *S* had taken a shower before coming over and *T* believed that she had taken the shower to impress my boyfriend. When they were asked to stay for beers *T* snapped and we were both really disturbed by the interaction. I had always thought there were a lot of red flags for abuse when *S* would talk about *T*, but it was mind blowing to see the red flags the first time meeting him. 


*S* called me this week excited that *T* is buying an engagement ring and that they are about start their family. When I brought up some of my concerns (way more gently then usual) she took almost all of the responsibility for why *T* is controlling and jealous, going so far to say that she “triggers” the behavior. 


So three questions for you all 

1. Do you guys have any advice on how to bring up these concerns in a more constructive manner? I have brought up concerns throughout the relationship but they have fallen on deaf ears regardless of if I am really blunt or more gentle when talking about them. I also obviously don’t like the guy, but don’t really want to come off like the advice is because I don’t like him, rather that I am concerned for her

2. if they do end up getting married, do you have any advice on how you would say you don’t feel comfortable being part of a wedding because of *T* especially if she would like to include me in the wedding party?

3. What would you do if you were in my shoes and why?",spechie9991,2020-04-08 22:59:52,1,493,44.41,86.77,13.57,40.35,22.41,15.42,89.66,56.39,15.82,12.37,3.65,0.61,1.42,4.87,1.83,3.45,5.07,13.59,11.36,5.68,7.51,1.22,19.07,3.04,1.22,2.03,1.42,3.85,5.48,3.04,2.23,0.81,1.01,0,17.24,0.81,1.42,2.84,3.45,12.78,1.42,2.64,3.04,3.45,2.03,3.25,1.83,0.61,1.01,0.2,1.62,0.41,0.41,0,0.81,9.33,4.46,0.61,3.04,1.22,0,5.88,10.95,1.42,14,2.84,6.49,4.87,1.01,1.01,1.22,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.28,4.46,2.03,0,0,0.61,0,0,0.41,1.42,1.22,10.14

fxpszb,My mother is emotionally abusive towards me,"I have been dealing with emotional abuse from my mother for around 10 years now. She has mild bipolar and from the age of 11 i have been called various names, like: slag; anorexic; ugly; unwanted; dead to her as some examples. When i was 11 she punched me so hard in my head she split my scalp and i had to have it glued together, I’ve been kicked, punched spat at and honesty, i don’t understand why she hates me so much. 

When i had my prom we went dress shopping and i picked a dress i loved, at the time i was very skinny and my mother had a curvy figure and when i tried the dress on i picked she went and found the dress, tried it on and said it looks better on curvier figures. So i didn’t end up getting the dress. 

I’m currently 22 and when i walk past her in a room i can feel her staring at me in disgust, and have caught her multiple times giving me filthy looks when i’m doing something as small and making a sandwich or toast.

She tries anything to upset me even asking me what my boyfriend sees in me because i “have the body of a 9 year old” and i’m “anorexic” (to clarify i am only 5 ft 2 and am very petite) - i used to have eating problems around 5 years ago and when i eventually realised i was too skinny and had an issue i started going to see a therapist and when i was doing so every time i would be getting ready to leave the house to go to my appointment i would have major anxiety and cry and the only response i would get from her is “you’re doing this for attention”. 

Fast forward to 22, i have a good job, good boyfriend and a somewhat positive mind set but i can’t shake how she’s treated and is treating me to this day. 

I’m currently being told to pack my bags and get out whilst we are in quarantine for Covid-19 so that’s something i am going to have to figure out myself but i just not understanding why i am hated so much when i’m the only one in this family that is doing something good with my life.

I always help in everything I can at home, since my bitch-ass fucking father does nothing and we both hate him.
To explain, he is an abusive motherfucker who I literaly wanted to kill sometimes, they even are divorced, but my mom is afraid from him and doesen't say anything about. Not like me, who I don't even talk to him or confront him sometimes.
My mom does not help herself about this, so she later explodes and does stuff to feel better to me, knowing that I love her and I won't say anything to her.
Today, when I was carrying the wet clothes to the atic to dry them (im not english so i dont know how to correctly say it) she said loudly to fuck off because i left a tissue inside some jeans and it made a bit of a mess. I just told her (literaly) that no, I don't want to just fuck off and I shut up and went sulently to do that thing she told me (puting those clothes there). 
Afer that, she made me some lunch, and I ate peacefully and she came and took another portion of my lunch.
I always sigh when this happens, but today she told me while laughting: ""come in, sigh again"", and I coludn't resist and showed the middle finger BUT NO TO HER, to put in context, i was sitting looking staright at TV and she came from the side, so I basically showed it to the TV.
From that, she went to the kitchen and from the anger, i started hitting my leg with a small fork, making only sime small red dots.
Then I went to tell her i really was sorry, and she sent me to fuck off again and if i'm not a pussy to get out.
My question is, is it even okay to parents to be such bad to children and the children should just sat nothing or should children at least defend verbally ?(without being dicks of course)
I also want to know why she does treat me so bad sometimes, im not a trublemaker kid, i really do study and go well with school stuff and i dont do drugd or dumb-ass shit like that, and i love my mum and being with her.
Im planning to beat my face to the point i bleed just to make her sure im sorry",icy_enperor,2020-04-09 04:16:27,3,516,19.97,15.21,54.68,1,32.25,12.02,93.99,60.47,22.67,16.86,11.43,0.19,0,4.84,0.39,5.81,3.88,12.6,7.56,6.4,9.3,3.29,18.41,4.84,2.33,1.36,0.19,2.52,7.56,1.94,5.43,0.39,3.1,0.78,11.63,1.36,0,4.65,1.16,13.57,1.55,2.52,1.36,3.68,1.55,4.26,3.29,0.78,1.36,1.16,5.04,2.71,0.39,1.36,0.97,5.62,1.16,0.78,2.71,0.97,0.78,4.46,12.02,1.16,10.66,1.94,5.04,3.68,0.58,0.58,0.39,0,0,0.19,3.88,3.1,0,0.19,0.58,0,13.95,2.71,6.59,0.19,0,0.19,0,0.78,0.78,1.16,1.55,0

fxw8a2,Why do my friends condone my abuse,"I left my abusive toxic ex a few months ago. He financially drained me, pushed me towards  a mental break down, would break things around the house and throw objects at me, threaten to throw things and otherwise be nasty to my cats, verbally degrade me, constantly make me feel like his problems were my fault, isolated me from my friends and family, pitted people in my life against me, constantly get high, deliberately trigger me fully knowing my history (csa survivor), and victimised himself when I would call him out for his behaviour. Long story short, I'm doing far better without him.

Something that has been bothering me about the situation recently is the behaviour of someone who, until recently, I considered to be my best friend. I have known this person for 12 years, and while they were also friends with my ex for five years they helped me to escape and insist that they are to be trusted. However, I have learned that they still continue to meet with my ex despite being witness to some of the abuse towards me and having also been on the receiving end of it themself. They continue to tell me things like ""not to upset you, but he is looking really good right now and he's shaping up"", ""he asked me if he abused you"", ""he's been really helping me out"", ""your problem was that you didn't stand up for yourself enough and he's the type of person that will act out if you allow him to"", ""I'm so lonely and he's been keeping me company"", ""his new flatmate is so nice-and pretty"", ""he's obsessed with his new girlfriend"".....the list goes on.

I feel so betrayed, and quite frankly I think she's a fool. I've told her plainly that I did stand up for myself, but that with abusers that tends not to matter.I've told her that while she saw some horrible shit that he's done, she has no idea what happened behind closed doors and that she's only seen the tip of the iceberg.I've told her that he's very good at making those around him believe he's changed and that he can be extremely charming and likeable when he wants to be. I was extremely vulnerable when I entered the relationship and throughout, and I feel like I'm being blamed for what he did to me and for not being in a position to wake up and get out sooner. 

Am I mad for feeling like my friend is being incredibly selfish and harmful? Am I being too sensitive? Am I being angry and bitter here? I do not know. All I know is that my trust in people, for now, has been broken and I simply do not trust anyone to not make attempts to hurt me. I do not want to invite new people in my life right now, because the ones who are already in it are giving me reason to doubt their intentions.",noxibus,2020-04-09 10:07:06,1,509,12.1,50,72.33,1.38,29.94,16.11,94.3,64.64,25.34,19.84,11.2,0,1.18,6.09,1.38,5.5,2.95,13.75,12.97,5.89,7.86,1.96,20.83,4.32,1.77,1.57,0.39,0.79,8.25,2.55,5.7,1.18,2.55,0.59,15.91,0.2,1.18,1.38,4.72,11.79,2.75,1.96,1.57,1.96,0.79,3.73,1.77,0.59,0,0.98,0.98,0.39,0.59,0,0,6.88,1.77,0.59,2.36,1.18,1.77,5.7,13.36,0.59,14.54,1.96,6.88,5.5,0.59,0.2,0.59,0.2,0,0,0.79,0.2,0,0,0,0,16.9,3.93,5.7,0,0,0.59,0,0.2,2.75,3.34,0.39,0
fxw9nd,What can I do?,"Can I get a restraining order?

I just found my way out of a horrifically abusive relationship between me and my supposed best friend of 13 years. He blamed his abusive behavior on PTSD (2 tours in Iraq/Afghanistan). It started with him talking about his ex wife sexually and comparing me to her. Then moved to slowly isolating me and my 6 year old from my family and friends. I now know that many things that happened were red flags. It turned into physical, mental, and sexual violence pretty quickly after I moved in with him. I stopped doing things I loved like going to the gym, going out with friends, and doing small things like shopping. Everything made him angry. My breaking point was the night that i was trying to get my daughter and myself out of the house and he pushed me into the bathroom and slammed me into the door and tried to rape me. I fought him off and was able to leave with my daughter (from a previous marriage). I took pictures of bruises on 3 occasions, on my arms and neck and thighs. I did not press charges because he has two children with his ex wife and he had told me multiple times that he would murder anyone who came between him and his kids. I know that if I pressed charges, he would end up killing me. 

Fast forward two weeks. I find out that I’m pregnant....completely unplanned...with twins. When i informed him about the pregnancy, he seemed ok. I did not tell him to get him back, however...looking back I wish I would have not told him. His only comment was “I will kill them before I pay child support”. I am 12 weeks pregnant now and he has continually harassed me about his rights as their father. 

I need to know if I can press charges against him at this point or if my window has closed for that? I am just trying to protect myself, my daughter, and these unborn babies.

fy0e9n,Are my parents abusive?,"I really don't know if my parents are abusive or if I am, because I cause my parents all kinds of stress too, and I've made my mother start crying and having a breakdown. My parents have yelled at me countless times in the past, although they have different reasons. My mom is somewhat mentally ill, and her yelling (and in some cases she physically assaults me) is from when her illness gets triggered and she basically loses control of herself. My dad yells at me usually from anger, and sometimes even hits me, and he did used to spank me when I was younger. My dad will usually say ""I barely touched you"" after I start freaking out at him for hitting me. He hasn't done it in a while though. 

Another thing my parents do is guilt trip, especially my mother. She constantly calls me selfish and gives me shit for my grades, which I do think is my fault because I'm just lazy, I don't know what to do with myself anymore, but her constant guilt tripping doesn't fucking help. I'm still lazier than ever and I can't get my work done because I get distracted easily. I'm thinking I'm being emotionally abused, but then my parents say I emotionally abuse them, because I always have a bad attitude towards them, but it's mostly for things they've done to ME, and they start getting all like ""you hate us"" toward me. And really I don't fucking know if I hate them or not, all I know is that my anger and ""hatred"" toward them is for the way they've treated me in the past. 

Then they go on saying that they get me everything I want and I do nothing for them, which really makes me feel like shit because it's pretty much true, all they want out of me is good grades, and I can't fucking get them. So yeah, my end of the deal hasn't been paid, so this means that I basically steal their gratitude. I've had suicidal thoughts recently, and to be honest I think I've been using suicide threats against them, which is manipulative. But now, MY MOTHER is starting to do the same thing to me, using suicide threats to get my attention and manipulate me. This family is so unhealthy, and I really just want to leave when I turn 18, but my parents are against this and want me to stay, but I really don't wanna. They had their chance, but I don't want to be how they are, they're so fucking toxic.

It was like he trained my brain so he can continually hurt me and control me.

It’s terrifying because I never want to get stuck into a relationship like that again, but my mind is so self destructive.

fy2ub6,10 years has been enough,This started ever since I was 8 years old and my parents got married. At the Time I was still around third grade and I got into choir then after that language fair to be honest I was a happy kid or so I thought I was bullied just like I’ve been since I was four years old I was born premature at 24 weeks and my abdomen and head are covered in scars from previous surgeries. Even though I can take the pain of scars I can’t take the Emotional pain away I let my mother know that I was bullied and her response always was “Why don’t you ever say anything? why don’t you ever speak up about it? why do I always have to guess what’s up with you?” I was Eight for crying out loud what does she expect me to tell her were the bruises that I got at school not enough for her. I remember my father used to hit me with a belt for miss behaving without even letting me explain whatever happened. Fast forward to my teenage years and I enter middle school the bullying kept getting worse I told them again and I was ignored. The bullying never stopped even in my high school years up to the point were in the last 2 years I had to see a school counselor multiple times a day. About 5 years ago my mother and father asked me why I don’t have a boyfriend and when I ended up having a crush on a boy they screamed at me telling me “ why do you even talk to him isn’t it obvious he doesn’t like you and he never will because you’re too clingy “ so I let it go. Fast forward to me actually finding someone in high school and when they saw me dating they told me I’m only with him because I pity him ( he has a medical condition and I have 4) to this day they don’t treat him as my boyfriend now fiancé they keep saying that I should go out with him officially but neither of us can drive,IBnerd100,2020-04-09 16:12:20,2,365,15.66,40.26,95.14,11.56,30.42,13.15,93.42,63.01,23.01,19.18,12.33,0.27,1.64,3.29,1.64,3.84,4.38,12.6,11.51,7.95,6.3,3.29,20.82,3.01,1.64,2.74,2.47,0.27,3.84,1.37,2.47,0,0,0.82,13.7,1.64,0.55,1.64,3.56,10.41,1.37,3.01,0.55,1.1,2.19,2.47,2.74,0.55,1.64,0.55,1.64,0.55,1.1,0,0,6.58,1.64,0,2.74,1.64,0.55,9.04,10.96,0.82,18.63,2.19,6.58,11.51,1.92,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.67,1.92,0,0,0,0.82,0,0,1.1,3.29,0.55,0
fy2v1f,Is this abuse or am I just sensitive ):,"Been together 5 years &amp; live together, and this has been a recurrent pattern in our relationship. He will get mad, scream, call me names (this has diminished over the years but still happens from time to time) tell me to STFU or use other hurtful language. In the past he has thrown and broken objects (not at me) made scenes in public when I’ve Upset him (incredibly humiliating but he says he sees red &amp; can’t control it), but has never laid a hand on me. 

He’s never told me I’m worthless or to kill myself or any of the other nasty things I associate with verbal abuse but I feel emotionally unsafe at times. He can be lovely and I don’t feel that these instances occur often but I feel on edge a lot around him.

I’ve of course communicated with him about this multiple times, and things have gotten better, but I feel like any time we make progress and go a period without fighting like this it inevitably happens again. I’ve been told I’m too sensitive, that he doesn’t mean it, his tone and volume are natural, etc.

I feel so insane for feeling like this, he’s in the other room coaching a kids martial arts class via zoom and I can hear the kindness in his voice, i don’t feel like he’s a band person. The idea of breaking up, moving etc sounds so impossible and I’m genuinely feeling lost. I guess I’m just looking for outside opinions :/

I have bills I need to pay and I have all ready been told by my bank that I do not meet the criteria to have my payments put on hold or postponed.

I ask because my situation is getting worse.  My husband came home today an hour late after going straight from work to a friend’s house to “walk” and screamed at me for almost 15 minutes about how I need to answer my “god damn phone” when he calls.     I had texted him when he was 30 minutes late saying that I was worried about him and hoped he was okay.

I tried to tell him my phone never rang and if he had called when he left work I would have been on the phone with the vet, and since he did not leave a message I would not have known.  I was called a liar, I was told I am purposefully guilt tripping him and making him feel horrible.  He told me I need to be more responsible and called my phone to prove I was lying to him.  Despite the phone being at full volume, the ring tone could barely be heard.  I was then ordered to change the ring tone as I was obviously having trouble hearing it and I am NEVER to not answer the phone when he calls.  And if I miss a call I am to call right back!

He said I was making him feel bad on purpose, that I am trying to hurt him by making him feel guilty about seeing his friends when I don’t have the decency to minutes answer my phone or call him if I am running late.  He screamed and ranted and raged for 15 minutes, took a shower and then ate dinner and acted like nothing happened.  Even going as far as to ask what was wrong with me.

I need to get out of here and while I am at the point where I don’t care if I leave behind my books or toys or even my clothes (cat ALWAYS comes with me), I would like to know I have a group helping me get on my feet.",Alorxico,2020-04-09 18:32:46,0,403,21.47,31.88,63.54,2.23,25.19,8.93,95.78,60.3,20.1,18.11,12.9,0,0,5.21,0,1.99,4.22,11.91,10.67,5.46,9.68,2.23,25.06,3.97,1.74,1.99,0.74,1.24,5.71,1.49,4.22,0.99,0.99,0.5,14.64,0.25,0.25,0,5.46,14.14,2.73,2.23,4.47,3.47,1.74,3.97,5.21,0.25,3.97,0.99,0.99,0.5,0,0,0.5,6.7,2.48,1.49,0.99,1.24,0.99,7.94,13.15,1.24,13.15,2.98,4.47,5.96,2.23,0.74,0.74,0.99,0.25,0,0.5,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,7.94,3.47,1.74,0,0,0.25,0.25,0,0.99,0.74,0.5,0

fybmyt,Was it really that bad?,"Hi new poster here having a bad day and was hoping for some advice. 

TW possible rape?


The day of the final break up with my ex, (and best friend of 6 years), I started realizing that things weren't normal. I was venting to a family member about the things that upset me in our relationship (a huge one being that he didn't listen when I said no to sex) turns out that isn't normal.. finding out how others felt and their reactions to the things I had normalized in our relationship gave me the courage to finally not back down. Well that's how that relationship ended, but of course a clean cut was too easy. A month later I find out I'm pregnant. That sucked.

 Its been nearly 2 years since my ex and I broke up and I'm still trying to wrap my head around what was happening. 

Today is a bad day, where my head keeps trying to tell me that its just because I'm weak. That none of it was that bad, that I'm over thinking it, that I should be over it. The biggest thought that keeps coming back to me is that it's my fault. When it came to sex with my ex I often said no, but I didn't fight (or never hard or long enough). Maybe if I had of fought he would have understood that I meant no. Maybe if I had sex with him more from the start than he wouldn't have felt the need to force me. Did he even force me? The few people that know about it label it as rape, or borderlining rape. But that feel to wrong. I hear those words and think of all the stories I've heard of stranger and dark streets, but he was my boyfriend, it was different, wasn't it? 


Another thing I'm struggling with at the moment is that no one knows. Those close to me know some bits and pieces, my partner knows most. But my mother and sisters know hardly anything (most of mums side of the family know nothing due to the not so great or non-existent relationship we share). It hurts. 

I know I can talk to my partner about any of it but it feels wrong to keep bringing up my ex (he says its fine and encourages me to talk to him). But I think I want to tell my sisters, but I don't know how. How do you tell someone about something you don't even understand?  How do you bring up something that should be history? How do you help them understand how something that happened 2 years ago still effects you most days? How do you tell your family you were too weak and stupid to fight or stand up to someone and that even if you can't name what happened and that it was a long time ago that to you it matters? Is it even something others need to know? I feel like I am over reacting..

Being home is bringing back a lot of memories, don't know how to deal with it","I went through sexual abuse for years, I don't exactly remember when it started but I believe I was 6-7 years old, and it went to till I was 18-19 years old. I'm 24 now, I moved away from my home for my studies, and then is when it stopped, as I changed cities. He's a family member, doesn't stay with us, but he's been home and things have happened at home. 
I can't bring myself to talk to anyone in my family about it, because I know I won't be understood and I can not deal with that. I also can't help blame my parents for not noticing it that things were not okay with me, that I wasn't a normal happy kid, and not once did they stop to ask if I'm okay, or if everything was fine with me. Rather I've just been punished for not behaving normally or being difficult as a child. I have been trying to find it in me to forgive them, and I'm still struggling with it. 
Being home, being with my parents continuously it is bringing back a lot of memories that I had otherwise forgotten, being busy with college and friends and everything. 
I can't bring myself to talk to any of my friends about it to, because it is too much. I don't want them going through the pain of listening to me explaining what I dreamt of last night, because is it very very painful. 
I thought I was finally okay, and I was past it all. That it doesn't hold any power over me anymore. But.. unfortunately I think that's not the case. I can't understand how to deal with it. I really have no clue. 
Any help is appreciated.

fyfdz8,How to leave my abusive marriage? TW details,"It happened again last night and was awful.  He told me I was “running my mouth and poking out my chest” so he grabbed me by the neck. I hit him he choked me more all of this is happening in front of his 9 year old. I told him I would call the police and he took my phone and computer and his daughter said she would tell them I started it.  I got up this morning and took pictures of my bruises, a few face scratches, my left eye has a busted vessel, I have a horrible headache and body ache and of course the neck bruises.  I’m just afraid to make any move right now.  I’m also afraid I will lose everything or not be able to financially sustain myself.  I am the working person in our home, I make a good income he doesn’t work. He said I’m the reason he doesn’t work so he can “help his handicapped wife” but he got fired 4 months into dating me for stealing from his job.  I’m worried because I couldn’t afford to pay him alimony. Also if I call the police what happens to SD9 who lives with us? And what if the police arrest me?  I will lose my job and my finances and everything.  I want to start to save money out of my check and put in another account so I can afford a divorce attorney and an apartment.  We also just bought a house what happens to this house we just bought and are refinancing? I can’t let him know my plans or it will all blow up.

fyhrw1,My pregnant partner drinks whens she's stressed.,"My partner is about a month away from her due date,
And last night because she was mad at me and i was ignoring her to avoid conflict she take out half a beer and starts drinking it infront of me and the kids.

I was seething with anger and i snapped, I turn to my step son and told him he should message his dad and let him know his ex wife is drinking while pregnant( we are currently locked in a brutal divorce against him and he's trying to use anything he can against her in court).
I know this was wrong and more wrong to say that to my step son.
My partner then screamed at me and thru her bowl of food smashing against my leg.
I screamed back at her telling her drinking while pregnant is not okay.
The kids started crying and ran outside with our 1 year old. 
My partnerleft crying in the car for a short time.

I cleaned up and when she got back we argued more about it.
She said she's hates me, doesn't love me and kept saying I can grab my stuff and leave cuz im being kicked out, our fight before this she promised she would never threaten me with homelessness ever again.

I eventually went upstairs and after some time she followed and we had a calmer argument.
I told her she knows fine well how much it upsets me when she drinks while pregnant.
The last time she did this a few months ago,
She drank an entire bottle of red wine in a couple of hours. This just about killed me.
She keeps defending her drinking saying one half a beer isnt going to do anything etc and that I shouldn't make her so stressed then.
Eventually I left and slept on the sofa.

Today tho we were eventually sitting in the same room by ourselves and started speaking.
She said I have to watch waht I say to her, and I ask her why she thot i said waht I said.
She replyed because I'm horrible.
We started arguing about the drinking again and she just passed it off like it's nothing. So I got in the car and drove somewhere quiet.

I dont know what to do. She's hurting my unborn baby and there's nothing I can do about it. This is killing me.
I want thinks to be better again, I want her to stop taking things to far, she just goes into nuclear meltdown over the slightest thing.
I dont want us to break up because I don't want to lose my family, I know shel make it hard for me to see my kids, I don't even want to stay under any other roof my kids aren't under.
I'm also a stay at home dad with no money because she was working and is now claiming maternity.",Assipattle,2020-04-10 08:21:11,12,495,16.93,73.44,46.03,1,18.33,13.94,95.76,60.81,24.85,20.4,10.3,1.82,0,8.28,0,4.24,3.84,12.53,8.69,6.26,8.28,2.63,21.21,3.64,1.62,1.01,0.81,1.62,6.67,1.41,5.25,1.21,2.22,0.81,18.79,2.63,1.01,7.07,2.42,8.69,1.21,2.02,1.62,1.21,1.21,1.41,3.64,0.61,2.42,0.61,4.04,0.4,1.01,0.81,2.42,7.47,3.43,0.81,1.41,1.01,1.41,6.26,12.73,1.21,17.37,3.03,6.67,8.28,0.2,2.22,0.81,0.2,0,0.4,1.21,0,0.4,0.2,0.2,0,10.51,5.45,2.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.63,0.4,0

fyjiug,Some Outsiders don’t want to hear about your problems until it is too late. That doesn’t mean don’t tell your story,"I went back to work after two weeks of quarantine and was relieved to be with pleasant people again.  Problem was, I needed to talk about what happened during my time away.  I needed to talk about my abuse, I needed to vent and get it out of my head.  I have learned from the past that most people don’t want to hear about other people’s problems until it is too late.  When the victim is dead or has run away or the abuser is behind bars, that is when people on the outside of the abuse want to hear about it or be involved.

My first day back was no exception.  No one wanted to listen to me, some insisted I was exaggerating or making shit up, one guy even said it was my fault because I don’t “cuddle” with my abuser or “do couple things” like watch a movie together so what did I think was going to happen.

It was jarring and sad and it made me feel small, but one lady did say she was sorry I was going through all of it and said she hoped I would be okay.  She told me to stay strong and look for ways to leave.  If I needed help, she would help me.

And after she was done giving me the support I needed, said the words I needed to hear, I felt better and did not want to talk about what happened anymore ... but those who had ignored me or brushed me off SUDDENLY wanted to talk about it, wanted to understand what was happening and wanted me to know I would be okay.  Very hollow, very shallow.

But it reminded me that we as survivors can’t be silent about what we endure.  We NEED to talk about what we are suffering through and we need to be heard.  So, if it is bothering you enough to speak up about it, keep speaking up.  Someone will hear you and someone will give you the strength you need.  It just may take some time for them to be as brave about helping you as you are brave to speak out.",Alorxico,2020-04-10 09:50:23,1,383,25.23,66.21,19.9,18.11,19.15,9.92,96.87,62.4,20.63,12.79,7.83,1.31,2.09,1.31,0.26,7.83,2.35,16.97,11.75,6.53,8.36,2.35,27.94,3.66,2.09,2.35,1.31,1.57,7.31,3.39,3.92,0,1.57,0.78,15.14,0,0.26,1.57,0.26,14.88,1.83,0.78,6.79,4.18,0.26,3.92,5.22,0.52,3.92,0.78,0.78,0.52,0,0,0.26,6.79,2.35,1.04,2.35,0.78,1.04,10.44,16.45,1.31,10.44,1.57,4.18,5.48,0.52,0.52,0,0,0,0.26,0.78,0.26,0,0.52,0,0,11.75,5.48,3.39,0,0,0,0,0,1.04,1.83,0,0

And while I’m handling everything in stride, I’ve been having reoccurring nightmares about my abusive and controlling ex. These were very common when I left her about three years ago, and through therapy and a lot of meditation I got to the point where in my dreams I would just scream at her or attack her. basically I took the power back in my dreams that I never had during our very long relationship. Typically the dream would end, and I wouldn’t have one for a few weeks to months. Lately I think with all the stress of the world weighing on us all now, I’ve been having a variety of stress dreams. Some over work, some about people getting sick, and almost every night for the last week I’ve had dreams where I’m literally aware I’m dreaming and telling my ex after she’s done something cruel or controlling to me, that this is the reason why I divorced her. I’ve had metaphoric dreams about pushing her off of a bridge or something, to remove her from my dream state. But the dreams keep coming back. It’s exhausting.

fyllac,Quarantine is making me remember all the things I keep in my head.,"When I was a young kid, I was constantly told I was different from the rest of my family. I would be made fun of for my forehead and teased because I got more my mom's features then my dad. I also have anger issues which have not gotten better. Now I know you might be saying that I should go to therapy instead of making a reddit post but the thing is because of the quarantine and that I can't go anyway even after. I've never been to therapy over this. My friends don't want to talk about it and I get an angry outburst from my dad.And these all seem to be surfacing now because of Quarantine.   Here's my list of things I had to go through:

\--- Constantly criticized, teased, belittled and almost beaten up in numerous occasions for being different

\--- Shouted at for the littlest of things 

\--- Was almost chocked to death by my mom

\--- Constantly put down for trying to heal from what happened

\--- Being shaped into how people or my parents wanted me to be

\--- Had to deal with hypocrites who would tease me but then wouldn't want to accept their faults

\--- Had to deal with a family war that I had nothing to do with

\--- Almost got touched in the balls by a boy my age 

\--- Constantly threatened to hurt me physically

\--- Having to deal with mean teachers

Yeah I know, it seems pretty big for a soon to be 13 year old to deal with. Its like I'm a shell constantly trying to break out but the walls keep me in.  I'm hoping to reach 14 and get emancipated so I can live by myself and be happy with myself.

Anyway, back to the dog. It’s about 3, and a half months in a few days. It’s learning to go outside. It’s doing really well in general for its age. I am stepping in a lot as I have trained dogs and everyone was sick of stepping in pee puddles. 

About a week ago the tween took her out and left the door open. I go to close the door and witness her swing the dog about by the leash. The dog is wearing a collar so it’s being swung about my the neck. I go to take the dog away and don’t return it to her for much for several days. 

She then argues with me about her being able to take care of it. I break as I’m running lower and lower on sleep and let her have it a couple of nights on separate occasions. She lets it cry at three am in its crate. Good and bad. Good being it didn’t get let out to pee in the house. Bad being it wakes the household. It eventually goes out. She’s never trained a dog. 3 am cries without previous cries mean the dog has to go. 10 or 11 pm cries after just being out might mean the same thing but might mean just wants out of the crate to play or just needing to settle in. Could mean lots of things. But if needs are met and it’s bedtime it’s usually ok. She doesn’t concept that the time it cries is relevant. 

Then the other day my dog and her dog are out on tie outs for a couple hrs. I check on mine plenty often. Multiple times I’ve said the tie outs need to be distances to keep from tangling.  They tangle and not only does she not care, she walks away as I’m untangling them to go inside and be comfortable. She was likely the last one to place her dogs tie out in. Either way, help. I’m plenty pissed yeah, it’s a dog and can’t help itself the way a human can. And she’s been doing this stuff for weeks now this is just the past week and a half or so. 

Add to all this I go out with my dog again yesterday. Her dogs food and water are in the middle of the dogs area, tipped over. Multiple times we’ve told her put them where the dog can reach them but not knock them over. Simple. Yesterday was warm. No clue how long that dog was without water. I holler for her again and she just leaves her mess of balloons and doesn’t care if her dog has water. She is inside the house on some electronics. Tv maybe. Idk. I go water both dogs and noticed a balloon inside the dogs yard. This dog has eaten and pooped a sock before. Leaving a balloon out is not wise. This is just seemingly intentional neglect. The yard in front of the house is littered with balloons.  And then there’s a random balloon in the dogs yard?! Maybe random but seriously she leaves it even after being told to clean her mess. 

In all of this mom and dad “talk to her.” They also let her around the dog again. And in fact encourage her to care for it since they don’t want to. Idk what I want them to do. I can’t see her make the poor dog suffer. I can train it to function well on its own so it just needs the basics from them. 

However I feel abusive taking her dog from her and she treats me and my cat like shit for the past year or so. The cat was sent to a rescue between her behavior and my dads. In October we housesit for a relative. On the way home one evening she got in trouble and I said she’d be staying home. She said “I’m keeping your dog.” I wouldn’t let it happen and she got on serious trouble that night. Then suggests she wants to cut herself because she’s so upset. So in all this jumbled mess of venting and knowing I have and am suffering various small but covert and insidious forms of abuse, I don’t know what to do. My dog and I are stuck. My sister is abusing her dog but parents don’t seem to care much. Idk. I guess I just needed to put it all to words.

fyru6r,sexual abuse (female),"Hi, so I'm really sorry because I don't feel like I should be posting here. I don't actually know whether I have suffered this kind of abuse before or not, and up until tonight just sort of brushed the  possible ""memories"" off as my brain being super paranoid (which is still a possibility so I really am sorry if it is just that). anyway, the thing that's changed tonight is that I decided to do some research on what a healthy vulva should look like, and I noticed that the opening to my vagina is sort of segmented (randomly), like it has been cut but it's healed. really I was just wondering if this could be normal, and I really didn't know where else to put this, because I didn't want to trigger people in other subreddits; I thought it might be safest to put it on here. so sorry if this is a waste of anyone's time though, it really could be just my brain and I'm so sorry for wasting your time if it is (but hopefully the answer to this will help me to figure that out). thank you all so so much.",original_anaphora,2020-04-10 16:43:08,2,198,3.17,4.8,88.75,7.96,28.29,14.65,97.47,68.69,20.71,9.6,8.59,0,1.01,0,0,11.11,3.54,11.62,15.66,11.62,11.62,2.53,23.23,5.56,3.03,2.02,0,2.02,7.58,3.03,4.55,0.51,1.01,2.53,3.54,0,0,0.51,0,25.25,5.05,2.02,5.05,8.08,0.51,10.1,1.52,0.51,0,1.01,2.53,1.52,0.51,1.01,0,2.53,1.01,0.51,1.01,0,0.51,4.55,13.13,2.53,9.6,1.52,4.55,3.54,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0.51,17.17,3.03,4.04,0,0.51,0,0,0,1.01,4.55,4.04,0
fysdef,Is it fixable or should I just GTFO?,"My boyfriend (25m) and I (20f) have been together nearly 2 years. We met in college.

I have frequently asked myself in thesepst 2 years if the way my bf treats me is Ok. I grew up in an abusive household and had only 1 (unhealthy) relationship before him.

Basically, I just feel like he doesn't respect me. He yells a lot even though he knows it triggers me. He's said horrible things to me when mad. Like he told me he only loves me sometimes or that my life was shit before he came along.

He refuses to communicate normally. He's either yelling or unwilling to talk about the issues in our relationship.

Recently, I found pictures on his phone that he took in secret of me performing sexual acts on him.

I confronted him and deleted the pictures. He apologized. But now i'm stressed there could be more even though I looked through his entire phone.

It isn't all bad obviously otherwise we wouldn't still be together. Normally, he's caring if somewhat emotionally ignorant. He has supported me through a lot.

But when he gets mad he is so horrible to me. He uses my past traumas against me and just wont communicate at all.

I think I want to break up, but I rely on him for a lot (emotional support, driving, driving lessons, etc.) I could have that without him, but he is pretty much the only adult in my life i can actually ask to help me do stuff. I don't feel like he holds that over my head, but if it wasn't for that we may already be broken up.

So should I leave ? How ? And what even does a healthy relationship look like ?

I'll update you guys after my therapy appointment next week btw :)",papadanku42,2020-04-10 17:11:37,6,310,9.06,43.59,54.08,7.28,11.48,18.06,94.52,62.26,25.16,21.29,11.61,1.29,0.32,8.06,0,3.87,2.9,11.61,10.65,8.39,7.74,2.26,17.74,4.52,3.23,1.29,0.97,3.23,7.42,2.9,4.52,0.97,2.26,0,17.42,0,0.97,0,9.03,16.13,2.26,0.97,3.55,4.52,1.29,6.45,3.55,1.29,1.61,0.65,2.58,0.65,1.29,0.32,0,8.71,5.16,0,2.9,0.65,0.32,5.48,11.61,0.97,12.9,1.61,5.48,5.48,0.97,0,0.32,0,0,0,1.61,0.32,0.97,0.32,0,0,17.1,7.1,2.9,0,0,1.29,0,0,0,3.23,2.58,0

Me and my husband of 4 years have been fighting so much. I want to leave.. only thing is that I have NO WHERE to go. I have NO MONEY! I have NO JOB! And I have 2 kids a 5 year old and  1 year old. Today we argued and said I was leaving him. I packed my stuff and my boys and he begged my 5 year old to stay with him. He kept telling him “mommy I s going to take you away &amp; you won’t see me” and my sons heart broke and was crying. I cannot deal with this. I came back home because I have no where t go. My parents live 5 minutes away but I’m sooo afraid of what they will say “they judge a lot”. I’m so embarrassed to ask anyone for help. He kept telling me “your not taking Liam (our oldest)” in front of his face!!! He’s been saying for a while that I can’t take both of them I can only take the baby with me and leave the oldest with him. He gets so defensive about it. I don’t know what to do I’m at a loss! I obviously can’t do anything since I have NOTHING!!! I’m an online college student getting my degree in one year. Other than that I have nothing!

fytwtw,Is this abuse or assault?,"So, today something happened. 

Usually I have a routine to walk in a park every morning around 10AM-12PM. Sometimes I'll show up earlier. My husband has me do this because he is paranoid that my eating disorder will get worse if I don't stay active since he noticed I tend to eat more times a day when I walk more. Usually I can barely finish a meal and typically eat once a day. Now since I've been walking I still can't finish a meal, but I do eat about two times a day. Rarely three times. I'm still working on it. 

Today while I was out for my walk my rout goes through this forest trail that spans two miles in one circle. Before I got into the woods I saw a guy friend of mine. He sometimes flirts with me and I always tell him I'm not interested cuss, duh, marriage. I value loyalty more than anything. The guy hated my husband because my husband did get extremely abusive with me and I was beaten daily and had broken bones, but over time my husband said he can't stand hurting me and he hasn't had done anything like that for almost a year now after working on his anger issues and talking out his problems with me instead of keeping it inside until he explodes. 

But anyways the guy asks about my husband and is genuinely surprised at his turn around and stuff. This guy used to be close to me. He knew about my past. I was kidnapped as a teenager for four years and used as a sex slave during the time to many men. For some reason he asked me about those guys as he knew I sometimes talk to them. We'll call this guy John. So I got sort of awkward and when I'm nervous I often start laughing at times. I lie a lot when I lie which is kind of a funny fact about me. But anyways while walking in the forest trail and he tags along I eventually tell him how they are. John notices I'm nervous when talking about my time as their captive, and tells me to relax. 

John says he's surprised I still have sanity and are so normal still after it and asked some personal questions which I hesitated at first but then answered. Then after a while we got off the topic and were talking about normal stuff after that. After a while after tagging along I notice we got into sort of a dense part of the forest where people rarely go to. I noticed there were no people seen for a good fifteen minutes now and suddenly got a odd feeling. 

I looked into the bushes thinking I needed to get away from them just before John suddenly leans against me and wraps his arms around me. I suddenly freeze as his hand moved down my crotch and he felt me against my pants. He whispered things in my ear saying he will do things to me and rape me like those guys have done. At that point I just didn't move and didn't know what to do. I tried to say something but I stuttered as he slid his hand under my pants and felt my underwear before putting his hand under my underwear. He was rubbing his fingers against me trying to put them in me.  I just felt hallow. I was so scared and frozen that I didn't even make a noise other than tremble. He suddenly began dragging me into the bushes and I remember the whole time in my mind I was thinking ""This is wrong. No. I don't want this. I don't want this at all."" 

He got me through some part deep into it before he began taking off my belt. He whispered in my ear saying something like ""I'll fuck you"" But I was still in too much shock to move. I whispered begging him saying I'm not ready or that I don't want to. Just trying to stall or stop him because I was too afraid of saying the word no. Suddenly my husband called. He actually paused then let me go and I just started stuttering a ton of excuses and saying I can't and saying I'm loyal and stuff like that. I answered my phone and my husband said he wanted me to come home right away because he was hungry and wants me to make food (He cant cook for the life of him, literally set MASHED POTATOS on fire) I said in a normal voice that I was five minutes away and was going home right now.  I put on my belt and John followed me out of the bushes. I start walking home and he trails behind me saying he should rape me. He shouldn't have stopped. He got close to me and I said my husband will think something is wrong if I dont show up since my house is across the street and he knows that. 

John looked disappointed and said he will wait for me and get me next time, He wont stop next time he sees me. He will make me feel raped just like those Japanese guys that had me. I went home after he left and my husband called me right when I crossed the street and I answered and said I was right down the street. I told my husband what happened, but didn't say who it was. My husband says I should call the police but I don't know what to do. My husband says I'm oddly super calm and seem like nothing happened. But noticed I smelled off like another person and I'm not one to make up random stories so he believes me. I told my husband the only reason I'm so calm is because I've delt with this crap for so many years I'm used to it, but I still dont like it. 

I don't know what to do. John did text me saying he wants to do it again and wants to meet me. I kept pushing him off and saying it wont happen, or make up excuses as to why I can't see him. I don't want to do anything with another person. I don't know if John can truly do the full thing but I'm still shocked. This happened about six hours ago.

fyuuvv,Beat up by fellow students,"Right I have tried to bring this up with my parents but they are so invested in the private school they sent me to it's impossible to reason with them

So I feel I can only reason with you guys. Essentially what happened was when I was 15, me and my mates trashed the toilet at my schools gym. We drew on the walls and threw toilet paper everywhere. Basic 15 year old shit. It caused quite a stir amongst our schools PE staff.

We did our changing for PE in a massive 100 people hall. At the start of our PE session our PE teacher came into the hall and asked who vandalized the toilets. Of course none of us would answer. He then said none of us would be able to take part in PE unless the person who vandalized the toilets was handed over. That person was me....

I was grabbed by a mob of around 20 people kicking and screaming. I was punched, kicked, and elbowed. I was dragged kicking and screaming to the PE teacher who was waiting outside the changing rooms. 

When he saw me dragged through the doors his expression changed from angry to scared. He looked frightened. I didn't realise at the time but what happened to me could get him in quite a lot of trouble. He sent me to the lunch room and told me to miss PE. It never went any further. At the time I considered myself lucky that the headmaster did not see me. Looking back at it now it makes a lot more sense. It wasn't reported higher up the chain because it would have resulted in this specific teacher being repremanded.

I do not blame my fellow students for what they did. They acted the way 15 year old kids would act in that situation. I do blame the PE teacher though. He facilitated this abuse and I was too blind to see it at the time. If only I had the foresight to complain at the time. But I was too scared that I would be told off for my own misbehaviour. This is a perfect example of the power teachers hold over students. I am genuinely traumatized by this incident and I have never fully recovered. My only hope is that other kids may read this and take action if they have experienced simmilar abuse.

fyv8tn,So confused?,"Started dating someone who was everything I wanted in a guy. We had alcohol problems so it became this Bonnie and Clyde shit. He had aspergers and severe anxiety over having a daughter out of wedlock and being on a life timeline,hating his job, wanting to move and his ex wife putting him in 70k worth of debt. He never put me down in looks or intelligence. I had gotten out of an abusive relationship and had ptsd from being stalked I don’t answer my phone often and need space a lot. It was hard to open up. We had the same personality and same wants out of life. However.. he had difficulty making decisions that he asked me to decide things or would call his mom. I know he had problems but I loved this guy SO MUCH I’ve never felt that way. He would surprise me with little things and do anything for me. Extremely charming and had a huge heart. Told me I was beautiful everyday. But when he drank too much(this happened every couple months) he’d get mad at my questioning and start cussing in my face anxiously and I couldn’t get him to calm down he would punch the wall. He was suicidal. He even broke up with me and said I’m going to find somebody who loves me and I’m gonna be fine.He got upset because I didn’t contact him enough and he got really lonely so he would start being really controlling like that. Then he started breaking up with me “to manipulate me” he said.  He told me he loved me but he was taking everything out on me and I deserved better. It’s all so confusing. He said he didn’t want me to go through this with him and he hated his life and it had nothing to do with me.

But still. I know he manipulated me to think there was something wrong with me even though it's him. I know he I let him talk down on me and I know he tried to make me think it was my fault when it's not. I know he's not even sorry for what he did and I know I won't ever get that apology. Yet he scares me yet he was the only comfort I had when I had family problems, yet he was cruel emotionally and mentally. I kept saying sorry when I know I shouldn't apologize. He made me feel like I was loved yet he friend zoned me then to pulling me back in then to friendzoned me the cycle kept continuing the constant gaslighting and me questioning my own sanity. He was great at putting up the mask he hid in to revealing who he really is behind the mask. I see him around town. It hurts every time I go out and see his car and his face yet I felt like this time he tore me down. It hurts seeing him with another girl, when I first meet him I should of saw the red flags yet he had away with words and made me feel like I was his priority. Yet i have to realize on what he did to me was okay. I sometimes wonder if I was caught in his prey and I was someone who he targeted me for be so venerable, when we first started following each other and now I wonder if i was his next victim, yet he had away with words. I felt like I was a puppet and did what he asked me to do. I know I shouldn't miss him but I do. And I don't know how be feel like myself. I was once someone who had it all, I was confident, I was physically healthy. Now I've lost weight and the constantly dizzy, my face is thinner, I second guess myself on trusting others, I don't go out in public without feeling anxious, I use to wear makeup but I don't anymore, I'm barely on social media and the poepole I know begin to worry I just don't feel like talking, I just want to sleep all the time.

fyw5gq,.,"I Know this is long and I apologise but I felt maybe talking to people about it might help. When I was 14 a few months before my birthday I met a guy who just turned 21, he seemed mature and like a great geeky person. After a year and a half of our online relationship he flew down and visited me and I lied to my dad about how old he was and he stayed with us permanently. He started changing. Everything was my fault, he would threaten to leave and kill himself,and that he left everything for me. After him trying to take my mom's car and he pushed me down and threw me onto a bed making me hit my head and leaving so many bruises. I was silent for a few days. One day he was playing a game with his friends and I was taking a nap asleep on my stomach he had got onto of me and held me down even after I screamed and cried. After another few days of sitting in the living room while he was in our bedroom just so I could avoid him I finally decided I didn't want him around anymore and I asked him to leave. He convinced me to continue talking to him and I did for a few months. It just got worse and I lost all feelings for him and I hated my life because I felt this is how my life would always be. In April 2019 I started talking to my best friend of 7 years and I fell for him. July 5th me and my best friend got together  and I'm so incredibly happy. Me and my best friend at the time were in different states and we had to do long distance until August. I continued talking to my ex until I told my now fiance the truth. In Sept 2019 my ex made a insta just for the sole purpose of telling his side of the story and also posted nudes of me. I was devastated and I knew I could press charges but I was scared. I hadn't told my dad the truth yet and I didn't want the drama I just wanted it over with. I finally told my dad and he freaked out on my ex. He helped me be able to not ever hear from my ex again. After a few months my ex stopped contacting me but he will still post stuff about our relationship from time to time (according from my friends). I'm happy with my life now but I can't get over the past. I can't go to therapy because I have no insurance and not alot of money. I was hoping maybe I would feel some relief posting this. I'm not sure.

fywpds,I’m in quarantine with my abusive step dad (long post),"I’m not sure who’s going to see this, but I figured I’d ask.  I’m in a very toxic situation at home and I need help.  Basically, my mom and stepdad are going through a really nasty divorce and will now have to battle for custody of my little sister.  My stepdad has a history of being emotionally and verbally abusive towards me and my mother (now starting to become passive-aggressive towards my sister when she doesn’t want to spend time with him because she’ll tell him that he’s mean, especially when he blames her for things he should be responsible for as a 45-year-old man. An example being that when he’s supposed to be watching her, he’ll go into his bedroom and watch tv and fall asleep.  When he wakes up and realizes the time, he’ll blame her her for not waking him up and that she should’ve told him what time it was as well.  She’s 6.).  Since my mom started the divorce papers, he’s been getting out of hand.  He’s never liked me.  He’d always undermine my intelligence when I’d talk about how excited I was when I found out I’d be taking honors and ap in high school by stating the education system is faulty (which I’m not saying it isn’t, but I worked really hard to get into those classes and maintain good grades as well.  He never once congratulated me or asked about any of the topics I was learning, which I’d talk about frequently because I was lucky enough to have amazing teachers who made classes fun and exciting), telling me how I was gross for not showering frequently (a habit that started when we moved in with him because when I took showers longer than 10 min, he’d start banging on the door and yelling at me to get out.  He once even walked into the bathroom screaming at me to get out.  I know it’s tmi but I was in middle school at the time beginning to learn how to shave, which is why some showers ran long.  Luckily my mom defended me in this case and got him to back off.  I’m a very clean person, and I hate going a day without a shower.  I know this isn’t something I should get defensive about, but when this was happening it made me incredibly insecure since I felt filthy and stupid for having so much anxiety to use the bathroom.), and constantly telling me that I’m a failure for still staying at home and that I’ll amount to nothing ( for context when I graduated high school I wasn’t ready to move out of state far away from home.  I grew up in a family oriented home and having a strong connection with my family since they helped raise me when my mom was a single mother.  I was also scared to leave all of my friends behind and be put in a situation where i was in an unfamiliar environment with people o didn’t know.  Nothing uncommon for to prospective college student, but I knew I wouldn’t be able to overcome such a big change in my life since I grew up very sheltered with my mom as my only parent.  My mom also said that even if I did want to go out of state for school, she wouldn’t be financially stable enough to support me and that it would be best to stay local. I’m now 21 and I still live with my mom, but I’m a full time student at a local college in my area. I’m also working part time so I can pay for gas and any books or supplies I might need since I’m very fortunate to have my mom paying for my tuition.  I’m really lucky to have such a supportive mom, but my step dad resents her for it.  He says that he should’ve kicked me out when I turned 18, and if I’m still staying home I should be paying rent to him.  Whenever he threatens to kick me out, it’s never over whether or not I contribute to helping around the house, which I do and my mom has said that I do significantly more than him, but because I called him out for being passive aggressive and for insulting either me or my mom.).  I know this is already long, but please bear with me.  I’ve had him call me a c*nt, b*tch and wh*re on multiple occasions, along with him once threatening to kill me, but he’s never been physically abusive towards me. He has, however, thrown furniture around the house, back me up into a corner so he could tower over me and then scream at me to intimidate me, and he once slammed the door on my mom’s hand when he was leaving during another fight.  My mom also found a few of his criminal records (most of them being altercations that had to be broken up by the police, and the other my mom found when she suspected of him cheating of him when he was younger being caught as a repeat customer with a prostitute.) and she was able to get a hold of the records of when dcf came to my house on two separate occasions.  One of when she went to a crisis center after the fight in which he threatened to kill me (I was around 14 or 15) and the other of when I went to my guidance counselor in distress because he had this paranoia that I was going to kill my infant sister (it stemmed from the fact that when my mom announced her pregnancy with my sister, I was extremely upset.  This was because my mom is an optimist to a fault.  Despite the constant abuse I was receiving my step dad, he had manipulated her into believing that he wanted to have a happy family and that they could work it out together.  My mom believed this despite me constantly expressing how unhappy I was and that I wish she would leave him.  So when she became pregnant, I felt betrayed  with no voice  and I felt that my mother was taken away from me.  Of course I love my sister, and she’s the one I’m most worried about in this situation.  It’s just that at the time of me expressing my unhappiness with my mother’s pregnancy, it was enough to set off this paranoia within him).  With divorce becoming more involved, he’s starting to act out more.  During one of the arguments I had with him,(me standing up for myself because he was betraying me under his breath and calling him out for having no right to criticize me since he failed out of college 3 times and that despite taking his time to finish his associates degree over the course of about 10 years (this is from the time I met him to now) since he works full time, he cheats in every single one of his classes. I also pointed out that his only real accomplishment in life is when he peaked in high school as an athlete, and that even though my accomplishments are small, I’m consistent in making those improvements in my life and that they outweigh anything he has ever done) he become so angry that he went and grabbed my arm while cussing me out (he’s never even laid a hand on me before) and wouldn’t let go until my mom got in between us and pushed him away.  With states now encouraging social  distancing/ implementing a quarantine, being stuck at home with him has only caused the situation to further escalate.  Ever since the quarantine began, he has picked multiple fights with my mom every single day on the days he isn’t working.  The harder she tries not to engage, the more he tries to get in her face and taunt her until a fight breaks out.  I’m scared that he’ll soon be violent given his record and that he’s had no problem throwing furniture around the house when he’s mad.  My mom’s trying to stand her ground as best she can while we’re still living with him, but it’s been hard.  Most of my relatives either don’t have enough space or are they’re old enough to be at risk of the corona virus being fatal to them (my step father is an essential worker and when he comes home he’ll stay out late.  We don’t know where, but if he came into contact with something, my mom and I wouldn’t want to pass that onto our family.).  My mom has been trying to find a new home for us to move into, but she can’t put anything in her name until after the divorce, if she were to do it before the divorce he would be entitled to part of the property she buys (which he would definitely exercise, since during one mediation meeting he tried to convince the mediator and my mom that he should have the keys to my mom’s new home so that he could stay there with Chloe until she came home from work.  My mom flat out said no because he shouldn’t be entitled to act like her home is his to just relax in along with that once we move, I shouldn’t ever have to see him again).   I’m just scared of what will happen during the time that we’re with him, and I need help.  I want to know how to defend myself against if something should happen, and what I should do to help protect me, my mom and sister legally.  My mom will soon have to file against him in court, and she’d like me to testify.  What should I even talk about? There’s so much stuff that I’m not even mentioning here, and I wouldn’t know how to bring that up in court without breaking down.  I’m lucky that my mom is giving it her all and doing what she can to keep me and my sister’s spirits up, but I feel like I’m in an impossible situation.  I’ve been dealing with my step dad since I was in middle school, and I feel like things have only gotten worse.  Even with the divorce being completed soon, I can’t imagine life after it being peaceful since I know he’d find a way to still cause issues.  I don’t know what to do anymore.

I can't even sleep while she isn't, otherwise it's impossible for me to, yet she complains how *I'M* too loud, I try to block her out and she then complains that my MUSIC is too loud.

fyy5g5,My boyfriend knows I have asthma and no job due to &amp; his abuse is making me want to contract this virus,"It’s currently 1:06am. I’m 23 years old and female. My boyfriend is a convicted felon who spent years in federal prison over a weapon charge; I’m pretty oblivious to the facts. We’ve had the cops come twice already in 5 months. On one of these occasions, it was my birthday and he smashed my phone to dispose of visual evidence of him throwing a (plastic) handle over my head the night prior. I’m over three weeks into quarantine with pretty bad asthma. I’ve been through so much in my life, but this is the most terrified I’ve ever been. Especially considering I have a dog that is counting on me and only trusts him and I. My partner knows that any exposure could risk my life and he drags me to stores. (Although we wear masks and gloves as per my request). I’m afraid I’m safer with him than I am receiving help from anywhere else, because I don’t think he’d kill me, but he will continue to emotionally, verbally and mentally torture me. It probably wouldn’t hurt so badly if this entire lifestyle change and freshly introduced stressors didn’t hurt my precious dog. He shakes when this man yells at me. I’m just looking for advice for my dog and I without us getting sick. I’m scared and I probably would have given up already if I didn’t have my dog to be responsible of. My family isn’t in my life as I was in the foster system and they remain pretty unwholesome bc they weren’t able to ‘get out in time’. I’m requesting advice now because I’d rather get this virus that I’ve been afraid of for YEARS (I did lots of research about 2016 and learned a pandemic or AI were the biggest threats to humanity)...than have to normalize this verbal abuse. I’m genuinely afraid of the affects this will have on the family I so badly want I’m the future. We all know that hurt people....hurt people. I’m afraid I’d rather die of this virus than be so broken down that I become a pathetic person who projects their own travesties onto others. Been there before. I already felt like a fighter but now I’m not just fighting for my life every day, I’m fighting for my ability to stay sane enough to keep people happy with the few interactions I get. I’m afraid to go to the store with him, but I’m so indescribably happy when someone notices my polite smile behind BOTH of my masks...",canxdd,2020-04-10 23:31:52,0,446,23.77,19.1,87.16,1,18.58,15.7,88.57,57.85,21.52,16.82,13,0.9,0,2.24,0.67,4.71,4.04,13.9,12.56,5.38,7.4,2.02,18.61,5.61,2.24,0.9,1.57,2.02,8.74,2.24,6.5,2.47,2.24,1.12,10.09,0.45,0.67,0.22,2.91,13.23,2.47,1.35,2.02,2.91,1.35,4.71,1.79,0.22,0.45,1.12,2.02,0.45,1.57,0,0,7.4,2.47,0.45,2.91,0.9,1.12,4.71,12.78,0.67,11.88,1.35,5.16,5.83,1.12,0.45,0.45,0.67,0,0.45,0.22,0,0.22,0,0,0,17.94,7.17,1.57,0.22,0.45,0,0,0,0.22,6.73,1.35,0.22

fz2qet,My friend is in an abusive relationship and i have no clue what to do.,"So I'm not the best at explaining my feelings over text but here goes. 

People in this story are me(17), isaura (16) and tim (16)

I've known isaura for a year.
 Around 3-4 months ago we became reaaaaally good friends and have been hanging out a LOT. And i must say i admittedly have a little crush on her.
Anyway,  she has this guy she loves but it's basically one sided love and he only uses her to fuck. 
He doesn't ask consent, he does it without condom sometimes( which she absolutely does not want). He chokes her randomly while she's sitting until tears come out of her eyes.  You're thinking she's probably into that, yeah she's not and she has told him. He doesn't listen en she doesn't dip the fuck out.
It's so frustating to see her get hurt like this. 
I've told her as well, and others have told her.
But she keeps giving him  chances.

fz54im,Life was hell with and away from my abusive mother.,"I don't know if this is the exact right place to say all this but I really need to get it out.
I was abused by my mother all my life really. I'm from Ireland and the first memory I have of mental abuse was around 2009/2010. I live in Ireland and at this time there was a huge resessions going on forcing my dad to go working in New York for 3 months while my mother looked after me and my sister. Dad would call every night but because I was such a ""mamas boy"" and believed everything she said I wouldn't talk to dad over the phone because she told me that he left us for good, I was about 5/6 at this time. As I got older things slowly got worse especially after my Grandfather died. Grandad wouldn't allow my maternal grandmother to bring alcohol into his house but when he died she and my mother would go boozing everynight till all hours. Often enough I would sneak down and I would have to carry my drunk mother either a 5 minute walk from my Grans to my house or from our living room to her bed room. From the age of 6-10 I slept in her bed with her just so she would not attack my Dad and my sister. She acted like she loved me so much and looking back she really neglected my sister (who was closer to dad) she began beating my dad and would call the police on him saying he was hitting her when that was bullshit. One day my dad asked me to ask her to stop drinking, I did and I think this was the point where the abuse really kicked off. She used to always call me stupid and retarded but the severity of the abuse became extreme.
One night a baby cousin of ours was staying over, Mom was out drinking so my dad looked after him. She came in to the baby at 12am and shook him calling him a ""filthy cunt"" for peeing himself. The night got worse and she threatened to call my paternal grandmother so I stole her phone since I didn't want her to be bothered. When she found out she began to strangle me, I remember nearly blacking out and her horrible angry face. My father was holding the baby and could not stop her. I mustered up the streanght to punch her off and her mother was watching us by the door and told me to ""show some respect to your mother"" she saw everything g and didn't care. Stuff like this happened alot. We went to the police but they only care when it's the woman getting hurt and not the other way around. One night after my great-aunts funeral she came home from the pub drunk at 12am and thought we locked the doors on her (we didn't) she began smashing windows and screaming from the top of her lungs. She knew how afraid I was of going to high school and told me I'd be all alone. She'd try to stab my father but he stopped her. This went on for about 3 years, she went to counselling but would laugh about the other people's problems and say she's had no problems. One day when I went into her room for toothpaste she beat the shit out of me me and my dad took my sister and I to tell our principal to file a report. That was the day we left to live with our paternal grandmother who took us in with no questions asked.
One day after school she appeared and started shouting to our teachers about how we were going to go with her, the school was in a small village so everyone saw. She wouldn't let us leave with our aunt and went on about how horrible we were. Then she left to get the parish priest who said we had to go with our mother, even though he knew we were being abused. (this same priest would bribe a social worker to lie about our reports because my dad was protestant and he hated that) we left school that day with our grandmother and the costody battle began.
Mom barely fraught the battle, not even showing up to the court dates which allowed my Dad to win full costody. My sister was fine mentally but I was completely broken. I was 12 at the time and extremely depressed and suicidal. We went to therapy but since I was only 12 and my mom had some say in what I did she cancelled my sessions only after 1 session. I went to another therapist after Dad won the battle but I didn't find it too helpful. I couldn't go up to my upstairs bedroom because I so desperately wanted to jump out the window and crack my skull against the pavement below. In 1st year of high-school I found it horribly difficult to make friends. In second year I made a few but they all hated me. Mom would stalk us every now and again outside of school. I hated/hate myself for being her son and was so depressed and anxious I found it hard to sleep. In 3rd year things got better, I made amazing friends and began workning more on my uncles farm. But I was still horribly scarred. That leaves me to today, I'm 16 now and in a much better head space but I still get very depressed and hate myself for being a part of her. I deleted Instagram which is my main way of contact with my friends because they don't need me and I don't make a difference in their lives no matter how hard I try. I find it really hard to sleep because I can't stop thinking about my mother even though I have not seen her in near on 4 years. I get horrible flinched and flashbacks to the beatings sometimes. I hate myself. Thats the short of it. I know this was really long but I needed to vent since I'm going through a really bad spell right now. If you're being abused then please try and get some help and get out of there, you matter.",Best_boah,2020-04-11 06:21:44,6,1071,37.53,62.81,63.45,1.84,21,11.76,93.56,57.98,21.1,17.55,9.43,2.24,0.28,5.23,0.37,3.55,4.39,14.19,7,5.6,8.4,1.87,18.11,4.48,1.96,1.49,1.96,1.68,5.7,1.4,4.3,0.93,2.24,0.56,16.34,4.48,0.37,6.54,2.99,11.76,1.59,1.87,2.15,1.49,1.4,3.83,2.33,0.93,1.03,0.37,2.24,0.84,0.84,0,0.56,9.62,3.55,1.12,2.99,1.87,1.03,9.43,6.26,0.56,15.59,2.52,7.19,6.16,1.49,0.75,1.21,0,0.37,0.37,0.47,0.47,0,0,0,0,9.43,4.76,1.03,0,0,0,0,0.28,0.56,1.96,0.56,0.28

fz7cdm,Help me,"So first, let's get things clear. My mom is a smoker and my dad is an alcoholic. Perfect combo, eh? I've been dealing with physical and mental abuse for as long as i can remember. I've been diagnosed with asperger syndrome, which means i have trouble making friends. Ever since my mom told me about it, i was devastated. I expected support from her, but nope! She started picking on me for it, calling me stupid nicknames like ""my little asperger"", and trust me. It was driving me insane. As for my dad, he drinks very often. He always keeps yelling at everybody, especially me. He sexually harasses me whenever he gets the chance, and i usually end up crying. He keeps coming into my room and making me uncomfortable to the point my mom started dragging him out of the room whenever he came in (my mom's not the best mom but at least she cares about me more than he does). Here's another fun fact. My dad has his own personal record! He almost broke my arm 5 times in one year. I don't remember all of the situations, but i'll do my best to explain some of them. My dad barely spends any amount of time with me, and one time when we HAD to bring him to a family dinner at my grandparents house, he started talking about politics and swearing, and i poked him in an attempt to get his attention and tell him to stop. He then proceeded to grab my arm and twisting it very hard, almost breaking it. Another situation was where i tried to spend time with him, like a normal family, and right after i sat next to him he grabbed me by the arm and shoved me off the bed. That hurt man. for real. Not to mention i have absolutely no friends at school or even on the internet, most people hate me for the way i act because of my mental disability, to the point i cut myself almost all the time. I even get beaten up by my dad sometimes. I can't deal with this anymore. Now that we're in quarantine things are getting worse ever since my parents have to spend more time with eachother. They argue and yell all the time. My dad is abusing me even more often. I really don't think i can deal with this anymore. I own 2 cats, and they're my only source of comfort. I love them. I don't even think this post is gonna make it, since reddit keeps removing all of them since i only just made this account to find people in a similar situation to me. I can't even edit my profile picture, bio or anything. This really sucks. Please help me.

fzmbsb,Stuck in a home with an abuser and no way out,"I’m a college student who has to choose between two abusive homes to stay at when not at school. I can’t get a job that’ll pay enough to let me move out, especially with how things are right now. I’m supposed to be getting a really expensive surgery this summer, which I’ll need to pay for myself, and I need all my savings to do so. I can’t afford to live alone because I don’t have a license or a car and the travel, after care, and surgery expenses will drain all my resources. I’ve chosen to live at the abusive home nearest to my surgeon and the non-abusive parent is happy to help take care of me, but I now am stuck here for 5 months with no escape or outlet. What can I do? When I was younger and was being abused at my other home I called CPS but that’s not an option here (and CPS didn’t help either, just made the situation worse). I have a younger sibling and one loving parent and I can’t risk getting her removed because the other home is just as bad. We both need to be able to live with our mom but her fiancé is incredibly abusive, hates me, and is constantly screaming at everyone and threatening us. I don’t know what to do. I can’t go live with a friend because all of our states are in quarantine. I don’t think there are any options and I’m just scared. Please, if you have any advice that may help please tell me.

fzompb,My Situation,"My Name ,for now, is TequilaAway. I am 13 y/o and i live with my parents (divorced, but still living together due to lack of money) my brother (annoying spoilt brat, but i'll talk about that later) and my Dog, Tequila. And i want to Run Away.

 I am used to Writing Stories that are purely fictional, so please bare with me and my Weird style of writing just for now, Yet i bet my life on this : this is all real. Also, i will be respinding to the ""comments"" if this isnt found out. Please Ask me Anything. (EDIT : while i was writing the story, i realized that it might sound strange that child enforcements or anything like that was called. I DO have a phone anyway... well My Country doesnt have anything like that, so i guess i'll have to find my own way to deal with this)

 I wasnt abused harshly early in life (thank god) but i was beaten, yelled at and Mocked from when i was 4-8 y/o i guess. but, their temper was getting higher and i was abused more and more: I have been kicked out of the house, bare foot for about four hours before Neighbors forced me back home. My parents put on a show about how I was the one who left and nobody was called or anything, Ive been beaten and almost fainted once (i'm not sure about that, i only felt lightheaded but i didnt really faint so idrk) 

 Although i've been through alot (dont feel like talking about everything rn), As you could've guessed from the first paragraph: my older brother gets it all : the phones, the laptops, the games and the dog (Tequila was given to him, i take care of her now that hes bored) even though we're literally not finding food to eat

 My Parents usually Beat me up over things my brother did, they take my stuff ( they give me their ""leftovers"" which so far has been a broken phone and Tequila) (The phone is okay ig, it onky has a slight crack on the screen and the model is quite nice!)

 My Brother also beats me up, he rages on me when he loses games and during most arguments,he ends up saying "" TequilaAway did it!"" and there goes everyone else agreeing and ....

 I guess that theres another question that you are asking :
 ""why does your brother get treated better than you?"" when i was six he tricked me into... doing some stuff with him i didnt like it but my brother said that i'll get used to it, we got caught and i was the one it trouble for doing that to my ""poor"" brother

 Talking about it for the first time is wild for me, i never would've guessed that i would tell something that personal, but i heard someone say that ""the wisest man goes to the nude beach and covers his face"" or something to the sort.

I know that most of you will shrug me off but i guess it was just a vant. if any of you could help me, feel free to do so, and i really dont know how to close this

With love,

fzoz8k,I was sexually abused.,"(Warning, this talks about pedophilia, my story might sound more twisted and sick to some which is fine, for those of you who don't mind, thank you for listening)

I'm fifteen and even though I am much better now I still frequently deal with painful emotions. I'm only fifteen but I can tell you I barely remember my childhood or even the 7th grade. I think it was because of the trauma I went through that now my mind doesn't want me to remember all the details and the times I was being molested. The reason I'm posting is because I haven't gone to counseling for some time and I need to but due to the current situation, I can't leave my house. Please if you have the time to read this please respond with what you think or any advice, I desperately need it. 

Lets start at the beginning. I remember the first time it happened. I was nine, I was in my room, on my bed and it was late at night. The person I used to call dad went into my room before bed time. I didn't see anything wrong with it because he was my dad. Even then I was very mature and had already heard about abuse and rape, but I was also still nine and it never crossed my mind that he had bad intentions. He didn't touch me the first time but he used my hand(I'll stop here). After that I remember being close to him because I was the first female to be born in the family. For four years de touched me. When I was around 12/13 everything went to hell. When I was 9/10 I still saw him as my dad and saw nothing wrong with what he was doing because I saw he loved me and he always went out of his way to spoil me. When I started to develop I saw everything differently, I realized what he was doing, but I still forgave him everytime he molested me. I quickly felt depressed, anxious, sad, mad and scared. You have to understand that at night, I would suddenly wake up to him touching me. I would always move his hand but he would keep touching me, he didn't use force he just kept trying. I would always see that he had his eyes closed. For years I thought he was asleep. Sometimes I would cry so he would suddenly wake up and ask why I was crying and when I would tell him he would be shocked and apologize and he would start crying. At the time we were religious so he would cry and he would say ""lets pray"". We would pray and go back to sleep. Everytime this happened I would always think that he would never do it again but after 2 days he would do it all again. When I was in the seventh grade, I was severely depressed and constantly had panic attacks. For 2 months I kept it a secret from my parent's. At school I would tell my friends when I felt anxious and had to constantly ask the teacher to step out. This happened about 3 times a day. When I was at home I would always be in my room. Then one day I had the courage to go to the counselor and told her I felt depressed and suicidal. I didn't have the guts to tell her why. My parents were called and we had a meeting. Looking back I could see the fear in his eyes. He was scares I would speak. I got counseling and everytime I had an appointment he would always be there, maybe it was to make sure I wouldn't say anything. My counselors sensed something was up because they frequently asked if I was being abused. I denied it for 8 months. October 2018 I almost jumped into traffic. I was still at school with my friends but it was after school hours. My father also worked in my school so I had to be near him all day. I didn't have the guts to end my life. Then December 2018 I was feeling very depressed, I wanted to stop living but I knew i wouldn't kill myself. I wrote it in a note and sent it to my friend. I went to the counselor and she asked my mother to take me to the hospital and that they were going to evaluate me. I ended up having to stay because they thought I was a danger to myself. 5 months later, May 17, I was called up to the front office because my mom was picking me up. My father was there and just leaving the school because he had break. As soon as I got on my mom's vehicle, she asked me if anyone was molesting me. I denied it again. She told me to not lie to her and that she knew. I told her who it was and she sobbed. This happened in a span of 30 seconds. She told me the reason she asked me was because one night she was coming out of her room and she saw my dad exist my room. Before he had exited my room my sister had ran to the restroom. She quickly felt uneasy and asked my if he had been hurting my sister. He said no and asked her how she could think that. She said ""if I find out you're hurting them I'll end you"". I can't remember if it was a few days before or after that incident but she said that under her bed she had found my sisters underwear. She hasn't wet herself but they smelled. For a few days she kept quiet but uneasy because her mind was tricking her into feeling horrible for thinking he would be able to hurt us. Back to May 17. We were in the vehicle, she told me my sister was being raped by him. I cry even more. She calls 911 and she tells them what happened. My father had told us we were going to go eat lunch so he was driving behind us. The police tell my mom to go to a public place and to make up a lie to get him to stay there before the police got there. We stop at the walmart parking lot. He gets off and opens my door and tries to make conversation. I had to pull myself together so that he wouldn't leave. The cops get there, he's immediately arrested and we are told to go to the hospital. I instantly realized I had to toughen up and that I had to survive and I couldn't end my life, I couldn't give up. My family was already going through something bad so I couldn't stress them out. That's where everything began. From that day on I had to fake being fine. I knew that eventually everything was going to be okay. We went inside and we were questioned and examined. The amount of harm that did to my self esteem is still something I have to deal with today. We left after hours of being in the hospital. Once we got home, my mom, my sister and I had to face my siblings. They asked where we were. My brother asked and asked but I ignored him. An hour later my dad showed up to our house. He didn't get off, we sent my brother to ask what he wanted and he said he wanted to talk. My mom called the police. They talked with him and told him my mom was going to gather his things and that he wasn't going to be able to come back. 


I will post more later because this is painful to write. I'm ok but I still have to remember everything and it's all coming back to me at once and it isn't very ideal as I have PTSD and I feel anxious right now.

fzppab,I don't know how to help my little sister.,"I was talking to my 17-year-old sister tonight. She told me about what has been going on with her best friend (16-years-old) and drawing from my own experience, it sounds like she is being manipulated and emotionally abused...

As soon as I walked into her room and asked how she was doing, she started crying. She said that this friend, let's call him Joe, wasn't texting her back and wasn't answering his phone. She was watching as each text showed the ""read"" status with no response. I tried to comfort her. Maybe something happened in his family. So I told her about the boundaries I had learned about in my therapy sessions. I told her about how I struggle with clinging to people and letting people manipulate me. I said that it's something we both have to work on.

This is when I started to get worried. She told me about how he only seems to talk to her when he wants something. So they've known each other for about 4-5ish months, give or take, and became fast friends. He told her, and our entire family, that he was gay. So when he made extremely sexual jokes and comments to her, she just assumed it was like that stereotypical ""gay best friend"" thing. But recently, he told her that he is actually bi and seems to be making more serious sexual gestures towards her. (I want to clarify that I understand he is 16 and may still be figuring everything out. But the way this all happened, especially from my sister's point of view, is sending a major red flag.) My sister and I were taught abstinence until marriage, and that's what she wants to do. So Joe's sexual advances are making her extremely uncomfortable. Not to mention, he's just not her type.

Joe is also gaslighting her. When I was talking to her, she was literally convinced that she is crazy. She struggles with depression and anxiety already. So he used that to his advantage. He makes comments that make her feel uncomfortable with her body and her personality. He's been separating her from her family. I didn't think much of it at first because they're teenagers. Teenagers often don't want to spend as much time with their families. I didn't realize how he was manipulating her into doing it.

But the worst thing he's done, according to my sister, is trick her to give up personal information. My sister and I both have a history of self-harm. Apparently she's been doing it again later. Joe saw the cuts on her wrist and asked her about them. She didn't want to say. So they continued talking. My sister made a joke and he told her not to joke about it because it triggered him. He gave a vague statement about being molested as a child. My sister has a huge heart and wanted to be there for him. So she asked him about it. He said that she had to tell him about the cuts on her wrist before he would talk about his personal stuff. So my sister did. She told him about her cuts. But then, when it was his turn to talk, he refused to. He hung up on her. He told her to call him when she wanted to cut herself. But when she tried to do that, he wouldn't answer. Then a few days later, he stopped talking to her.

I told her that I think he was being manipulative and abusive. But she kept saying that he didn't mean to and that he didn't realize it. I tried to tell her that if a parent gets drunk and then beats their kid, it doesn't matter if they meant to or not. It's still abuse. But she completely ignored that. I completely understand because I've been in several abusive relationships in the past. So I talked her through the DEAR MAN DBT technique. She said she would try it...

Am I overreacting? I might just be overprotective of my little sister. But it honestly sounds to me that she is being manipulated and it obviously isn't good for her. But I don't know how to help her. I don't know if I can do anything except be there for her.",AshleyRhy17,2020-04-11 21:03:56,2,731,5.27,90.3,1.46,9.12,11.79,14.36,95.35,63.75,27.36,20.79,6.02,0.41,0,13.54,0.82,6.57,2.19,12.31,10.67,7.8,9.71,2.6,22.44,3.28,2.05,2.05,0.68,1.5,4.38,1.37,2.74,0.82,0.68,0.27,25.31,2.19,0.68,9.71,5.34,14.91,3.56,3.15,1.78,2.6,1.23,4.1,2.19,0.68,1.23,0.14,1.64,0.55,0.14,0.82,0.14,8.48,3.83,1.37,3.01,1.09,0.27,9.71,10.26,1.37,9.44,0.96,3.56,5.2,0.68,1.09,0.68,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.65,8.89,3.01,0,0,0.14,0,0.82,0.55,3.69,0.55,0

fzutnc,a situation...,"When things ended with my ex, the argument got heated and he ended up choking me until i passed out and then pinned me to the floor in the front garden and was kicking the shit out of me. His neighbors saw and threatened him with a machete (its a pretty dodgy area ngl). So that was a few weeks ago and im still in contact with my ex and we're friends i guess. He's very manipulative and has a way of shifting the blame off himself, saying that i really aggravated him that night. I haven't forgiven him but i also have borderline personality disorder and this means its hard to cut people off when i have an attachment to them, no matter how fucked up it is. 

So i get a call from him today saying that his neighbor beat him up and the police got involved and they told the police they saw him beat me up and stomp on my head and as i was put on the spot, of course i just denied straight away that he did it because he was emotional and manipulating and i didnt know what to do. 

He's also just gotten out of a court case where his ex accused him of being abusive, but he had always told me she was the abusive one and anything he did was in self defense against that. I believed it when he told me but now im pretty sure that was a lie.

I just don't know how to handle this whole situation and i dont know if i did the right thing, denying it to the police. If this gets taken further i might have to make a statement in court and i just dont know what to do. I don't want him to hurt anyone else in the future. And i dont want him to hurt me if i tell the truth about what happened.

fzv1b6,How do I reconcile the two sides of my dad?,"21F.

Sorry for the novella I've written here, just...out of options and people to talk to, and it's big decision time.

My dad, in so many ways, is what a father should be. He's a goofball, sweet at times, a good provider, and has a really common-sense take on the world. He'll bend over backward for his kids and works his ass off for us.

Growing up, I was the oldest and the problem kid. Was the only one who got beat (belt, hair pulling, slapping, choking on occasion). It got a lot worse after my mom died - I was 14 when that happened.

Ostensibly, I was the problem kid because I lied about lotsa things. I was also pretty uncooperative when lectured or yelled at, because I was too busy staring at my feet and being scared, or mentally checked out. 

Dad started coming into my bed in the mornings when I was 15 ish. He'd grind on me and feel around. Obviously that was incredibly confusing and freaky for me, but when I questioned it my dad told me that I smelled like my mother, and he didn't mean to hurt me. So, I let it go, and this went on until I left for college. 

Jumped into a secret relationship my first semester there and bombed a few classes - Dad went ballistic and pulled me out of school. I was home for a few years after that. 
It was during that time that he suggested we start having intercourse - he spun it as being some kind of trust exercise, since I had ruined the trust between us when I went to school. So I went with it.

Anyway, he made sure I got back into school before my degree program dropped me. I'm nearly finished, but have withdrawn once again because I was seeing a guy behind his back. 

I've told my dad about how the whole sex thing makes me feel. He told me I ""could have a different perspective on it"", and ""it doesn't have to be a big traumatizing thing"". He thinks I should continue having sex with him and work on healing the relationship until I'm ready for a boyfriend.

He can also sense that I'm ready to walk away, I think. He tells me that if I leave and we end up estranged, there will be irreversible damage to both of us, my sisters, the entire family. I probably won't make it through med school and if I do, it won't make me happy. 

I'm afraid he's right. 

I'm also afraid that I'm gonna put a bullet through my head before this is over. I'm so tired. I love my dad, though he tells me that can't be true otherwise I wouldn't betray his trust the way I have. I'm afraid to lose him, but I'm also scared to lose myself.

fzvkrp,Abuse at the day care and other things about my childhood,"Hi, so I'm 17 y/o girl. I was mentally and psychically abused by this old woman at the day care when I was 5-7 y/o.
(I'm going to apologize already about the writing errors. English isn't my first language.)
(I shared this story thing in a another subreddit but I think that I should share this in here too) 

So. I don't remember much from my childhood or from the abuse. I just know that it happened.
Of course I remember something from it, but it's all hazy. 

There were 5 of us kids there. The youngest ones being me and my little brother who is two years younger than me. The oldest one was this 7 y/o girl.
It seemed that me and my brother were the ones that she enjoyed torturing the most.. The others usually just watched or just played while me and my brother were gettin beaten.

She forced all of us to follow her rules.
Here is the list of the rules that I can remember and that my brother has told me. Because I can't simply remember really anything.
- we were supposed to be quiet all the time. And not to talk
- She didn't like it when we were playing. We had to be quit. And stay still. But then she started to complain about it that we weren't playing and that we weren't speaking.
- we can't talk back to her. We can't cry. We can't get angry. We can't complain about anything. 
- we weren't allowed to laugh. But then she started to conplain about it that we weren't happy. And that we didn't have fun.
- we needed to smile all the time and be super happy to be with her when we did go to the store or if we were outside and we needed to do this always when we were with our parents in home. We needed to tell about all these fake stories about her. And how great and kind she was.
- this one I can remember her saying clearly. 
 ""it's better to being laughed at than make people laugh"" I don't really know what she meant by this. But it has stuck to me.
- I weren't allowed to leave the table if I wasn't done eating everything.. If I wasn't hungry or just weren't able to eat that insane amount of food that she did.. She would force feed me. Force force feed.. Stuff all of the food to my mouth with force. It always ended up me crying and puking on the floor and her beatin me afterwards for puking and crying.
- we had to hug her every single day before leaving to home.


I'm sure that there were more rules but those are all the ones that I know that happened and that my brother remembers.

Some of the other things that she did was that she would lock me in to her empty closet if I were crying or if I didn't follow the rules.
Even though I followed them. And so did everyone else.. She would still beat us.

I remember this one time when we were about to go for a walk she asked me a question.
""when we go out. What do you need to do?
I answered that I should be polite.
Then she grabbed my arm, bite it. Hard. and screamed ""DON'T FUCKING CRY THERE!""
Then she told me to use my sleeve to hide the bite marks.

About food.. Besides from the force feeding. Somedays she didn't give any to me. She would give to others. If I wanted food I had to do everything that she asked me to do. For example.. I needed to clean her house while she would tell me how worthless and stupid I am. 

She also pulled our hair. My brother got the worst from that. His hair was just falling. I remember that our mom thinked that there was something wrong with him. She thinked that he had some kind of illness.

Once I turned 7 I finally got away from her. Or so I thought.. She changed the walking time to the same time that I would be walking to school. When I saw her walking behind me with the kids I just runned away. I was terrified that she would come and hurt me again. 
The next day.. I wasn't so lucky. I didn't notice her walking again behind me.. She grabbed me and asked why did I run away. I said that I didn't notice her and that I would have been other wice late for the class. Then she just slapped me on my cheek and shouted not to do that again. 
When I got to the school my friend asked about the cheek. I just said that there was a bug so I slapped it away.. 

The daily routine was to wake up. Then go to day care and get beaten and tortured and then go home and listen the rest of the day my mom and dad scream and shout..
When I started school it changed to me waiting that she would have walked away from the path and being late for the class or me just going to the school an half an hour earlier. 
The abuse stopped for everyone when my brother turned 7 and started school. At that same year she retired.. 
Apparently it got better for everyone else when I left. My brother told me that she didn't beat them anymore that often and didn't yell so much.. But it still happened. 
.... 
My home situation didn't help at all the situation.. As I basically worked as their theraphist.. I was just trying to get them to calm down so that the shouting wouldn't turn to a real psychical fight. 

(my dad has some kind of mental illness. He was never diagnosed. But schizophrenia or something similar is pretty close. That's why they fighted all the time because he had these crazy delusions and visions and voices. He thinked that he wasn't really our dad so he just paid and did the dna test. And he would sometimes say these crazy things that wouldn't make any sense. Like that he was being stalked by someone. And so on. That's something that I remember. My mom and dad are now separated. And dad is doing a lot better now days..

But this kind of impacted me since when they separeted he wasn't doing so well then. When me and my brother would visit him. He couldn't take care of us. I needed to grow up fast. I needed make the food for us three and I needed to make sure that my brother would go to sleep and make sure that he was heatlhy and take care of him when I was 8.)
.... 

Me and my brother told about the abuse to our mom after some years. I was around 11 and he was around 9. My mom told us that she had no idea about anything that she was doing to us. She was really sorry for putting us into that day care place.. But her reasoning for putting us there was reasonable..

There was this other day care place. And apparently my mom knew the wife and thought that she would never send us there..  her husband was an alcoholic and was always drunk and watched porn while the wife was taking care of the kids in the same room...

And the reason why the day care lady wasn't arrested was because we told about it after four years.. There wasn't any evidence anymore.. And we didn't know if the other parents knew about the abuse.. 
...
I was fine until the 8 grade. I was 15 y/o  I had this really bad panic attack and after that I just wasn't able to go to school anymore or to go anywhere outside of my home. And I started have these weird out of body experiences and my memory problems became worse. 

I'm now finally going to therapy and recovering from the abuse. in my country it's really hard to get therapy.. Or a good theraphist that wants to listen to your problems and doesn't make their own conclusions.. (at least at this part of the country) I had this one theraphist that insisted that I was lying and that my childhood abuse was a story that I made up. And something really happened at my school and it all would go away when I would switch schools... Well.. The problems didn't go away. She was shocked.

Now I have a great theraphist who understands and wants to really help me.
We have planned to do some tests that no one else wanted to do.
But she suspects that I have some form of dissociation. Because of my memory problems and because the out of body experiences.
We found out that i have had them as a child too but I never realised it because as a child.. All new and weird is fun.. At least I thought so.
The dissociation is apparently the reason why I can't remember anything from my childhood. The first solid memory is when I was around 14.


But... Now I'm recovering and looking forward to the better future. And hoping to get back to school quickly. And I thank everyone that made it to the end of my random rambling about my childhood. And if anyone has questions. I can try to answer to them.",Ruby_Bloodrose,2020-04-12 05:05:32,0,1599,10.73,44.54,61.98,20.99,11.1,12.51,95.56,63.79,24.08,15.82,8.57,2.5,0.13,4.07,0.56,8.26,4.69,11.19,10.26,7.44,9.57,2.88,20.58,4.13,1.81,1.63,1.63,2,6.13,2.88,3.19,0.13,1.25,0.56,12.95,1.69,0.06,3.81,2.06,16.76,2.75,2.25,2.88,3.81,1.75,5.44,1.94,0.31,1.13,0.31,2.19,0.5,0.81,0.13,0.81,8.26,3.94,1.31,1.75,1.25,0.63,9.69,8.38,0.94,13.01,2.63,3.69,7.13,1.13,0.44,0.5,0.13,0,0,0.44,0.06,0.25,0,0.13,0,16.7,11.63,0.19,0,0,0.06,0.06,0.56,0.31,3.13,0.5,0.25

fzy31v,Im crafting my plan,"Update: 

I've committed to myself and my children that we ARE leaving. We just need a plan. We can't just go without anything... Then he's be able to try and take them. He threatens it every time I try to leave.

But, I have thought up a plan and I'm about to execute it. I'm trying to have courage because it's so difficult to push these changes into effect but 6 months max and I'll be on my way.

I'm using this upcoming stimulus check to insure oir escape. It's so hard, and please don't judge me, because I love him. It's unfair that I've given so much if my time to this person that has an inability to treat me correctly.

I feel guilty because he has no friends, no people but me... But I can't live like this. I can't be grandma stupid lazy bitch, Aunt pathetic whore, that dumb bitch... I can't be stupid for ever. I can't be treated like that periodically for my whole life... And even tho times are shifting to get better I am leaving. 

I will break down silently, I'll bear my nausea and fear of the future, I'll walk this path so my babies don't have to learn this as normal and so in a year or five I can look at myself in the mirror and be happy with my decision.

I know single motherhood, being financially independent, and alone is going to be rough. I break down at times scared of losing my best friend... But I just keep reminding myself of the bad times instead if forcing myself to forget. It makes me repulsed with him. 

But, it's not fair to update you guys in a story and lie and say I don't love him... I feel evil for ""abandoning"" him due to his sickness but I can't allow him to hurt me because he's sick. And I've given him a mole time to get healthy. I can't sit here anymore. 

I thought if killing myself and I realised I'd be leaving my babies alone with him to potentially be additional targets when they're older... So if I'm going to do something hard and scary, like suicide, why not just do something else and leave? Why not just go and live and be happy. 

I'm honestly so excited to be a single mom tho. No one telling me how to raise my kids. No one saying I'm too lienient or kind and how they need spanked (I do NOT allow my kids to be spanked. I'd die or kill to uphold that.) And just be happy with no yelling. 

Tldr; I have a plan. This stimulus check is going to be my saving grace and only chance to get out for years.

fzznaw,my story,"This is about me and my dad and why he is the reason for my emotional distress, self harming and near depression.

Our first bout was when he took to me to a clinic, to check if I was really his child, which was because I said to him that he ‘wasn’t my dad’ as a joke after I couldn’t play games on his phone, I was about 5 or 6 at the time so this was really nerve-wracking for me and gave me suicidal thoughts because I felt like I didn’t belong anywhere. 
This basically started everything, the negative relationship with his side of the family and our arguments.

I know this isn’t a big deal, but when I was 7, I didn’t get any money when I had done my communion, however my brother did. This will link on later. 

There was a big family argument, my brothers were throwing the ball around and it spilled over his drink into him. He completely lost it. My brother who was 
or 11 I think, at the time got slapped viciously by him, he was crying and my mum and I were trying to pull my dad away from him, but it didn’t work, so I hit him. It was an act of pure desperation so my brother didn’t get hurt anymore. Now, the attention was on me. I don’t get hit but he disowned me and threatened to leave our family. I fainted because of this, I didn’t know what would happen. He eventually stayed.

As he comes from Nigeria, he threatened, our family/our dog (that we had to give away because of him), saying that if our dog ever hurt us, he would chop it up and turn it into soup, because that is apparently a ‘tradition’ there. I got really angry because I was scared of what he could do, so I shouted at him. This was the first time he called up his parents, and made it known that I wasn’t his son, therefore disowning me, for the second time.

After a while, everything started to calm down until January, when again my brother got money and all the attention from our relatives whilst I didn’t. It was on his birthday so I was trying to keep my cool, but it was my birthday merely 10 days before, so I just couldn’t. I felt like I ruined his birthday and that I wasn’t loved, so I began self harming on my thigh, with a razor. He called me stupid for being so dramatic over something so minor, but as I said earlier, it wasn’t the first time this same scenario had happened and I knew there was something going on with him, his family and information about me which caused them to have a hatred for me. 

Now we’re in April and we have had another argument. His behaviour towards my mother has caused me to shout at him. He abused her, threatening her because she didn’t want to be with him anymore after he cheated on her several times. Always, he makes her buy items for our family even though it’s the point where she barely has anything left. Anyways, this is why I shouted at him. He was laughing at me because I was crying, saying that he can’t make her buy everything because it’s not fair. He obviously didn’t take my feelings as valid and it tore a hole inside of me. The sadness turned into anger so I called him selfish, but he used this to victimise himself, saying he doesn’t deserve to be treated like this and that I have no respect for him and that I’m nothing - he also managed to hurt my elbow when done this. It destroyed me. I was only trying to defend my mother and I felt like I did the right thing. So, I began to self harm everyday, but without any scars. 

Today, he just kicked me off the TV without saying why, with a look on his face that scolded me. I asked him why but he just told me to not say anything and to shut up. Again showing how my feelings as invalid for him and I don’t deserve his respect. For an hour, I was sat in my room, cutting myself with a razor. Everything had been building up for so long and I couldn’t take it anymore. I want to die and I’m only 15. I spent hours planning how I could do so and still am. I have been driven to this point starting from when I was only

g00aau,I wish it was worse,"mentions of: all types of abuse (CSA included), grooming, self harm, etc. 

I have a big family, but my mom, brother(s) and I have always been in our own little bubble, Ive never felt “close” to anyone else in the family. My brother (1.5 years older) got increasingly physically violent when we moved away from my father. My mom has had borderline for what seems like 30+ years, my father has narcissistic tendencies, and my brothers (i’ll be talking about two of them) have a mix of bipolar disorder, ODD, GAD, etc. 

At the age of 9 i began to be sexually assaulted by him, through means of him doing things to me while i was asleep. I’d wake up seemingly normal save for the fact that I was missing my underwear that i had on prior to going to bed. At the time, i responded to this no different than the fights we got into, it was bothersome and upsetting but i didn’t have immediate reactions to the trauma (i developed ptsd a few years later). This abuse seemed to casual in my life, he’d make passes to reach his hand up my shirt in the middle of the day. He’d walk in the woods with me and ask to touch me. He’d constantly assert his power over me verbally and aggressively because of our size difference. Everyone tried to help me, but i had to still live with him since no one else was willing to take him and my mom wasn’t willing to give him up to the system. My much older brothers were violent with him, so was my mom at times, and he would find any means of exploiting me anyways. 

What’s notable is the fact that he never succeeded in forcing himself on me while I was awake. In the woods, I told him no and we went home. I walked away from him when he reached for my chest and he’d stay away. Once, he took my change of clothes in the middle of me changing so i wrapped myself in a sheet, he tried to take it from me but i was able to get away and get different clothes to put on. I guess what bothers me more is to this day, not knowing what he did to me while I was unconscious. 

Even though I felt protected by my other family, they hurt me in their own way. My eldest brother (19 year difference) exposed me to things as an 8-11 year old that heavily scarred my perception of healthy relationships. He’d show me pornography, set me and my other brother up to fight each other, give me alcohol, etc. My mom has used me as her personal therapist for as long as I can remember as well as her verbal punching bag when she’s upset. I’d get shamed for self harming, my (lack of a) relationship with my father, and my own trauma by her, and made to pity her because of her personal hardships. I carry the burden of a lot of the issues of the adults in my life. I’ve always been the youngest in the house, but also the first one people turn to when they want to confide in someone and seek empathy. this itself has taken a toll on my emotional availability and gotten me into many friendships where i’m explored in similar ways. 

It’s been 8 years since this all started, he doesn’t hit me or try to touch me anymore. He’s understanding that he’s taken something from me that he can never atone for, and i’ve made surprising progress in my recovery, considering that even though to this day, he has been living with me this entire time. That isn’t to say he’s all better. He still does things to make me feel weaker than him, he gets in my space and taunts me just to show me that I can’t do anything. I don’t feel safe in my house to this day (in part due to my mom being “emotionally incestual” and abusive to me). 

I still have PTSD, but I’ve never stopped trying to heal. Despite this, I still find myself prioritizing everyone else’s emotions before my own. this includes my brothers and mom. I let them take advantage of my emotional state and am left feeling hollow. I want to hate them. I want to be able to push them away for them to stop hurting me. But i can’t stop myself from loving them. I pity them when they give me sad eyes, I feel for them when I say something insensitive, and I try my best to come to understandings with them, even if they don’t want to. 

I wish it was actually physical. I wish I was hurt, that I was given something to show for it. I wish that they hurt me the same amount, just physical instead. That they’d beat me, use me as an actual punching bag, maybe even physically exploit me. I would be able to hate them then. I’d know that THAT was wrong. Sometimes I feel like i deserve it more so than some hurt feelings, like maybe that would’ve relieved their anger more than yelling at me or each other. They get physical with each other, my adult brother and my mom have put their hands on each other and fought in front of me several times, same for my other brother. I wish I was on the receiving end. I wish I was part of that, because now i just feel like I had it easy. I don’t know what to do with this, it feels more like a desire for that to happen at this point than anything else. I don’t know what part of my feelings should and shouldn’t be validated. I don’t know if feeling like this is normal or not. 

If you made it to the end thanks for reading though all that mess. 


TLDR: I’ve been mostly verbally abused, but things got physical between the people who’d do it. I wish it wasn’t just emotional because now i feel like I had it easy, making it hard to feel like i was even abused.",perthrowaway467,2020-04-12 09:56:30,0,1048,28.93,21.69,86.69,2.95,19.05,13.36,93.23,60.88,26.15,19.08,13.07,0.48,0.1,3.53,1.91,7.06,3.15,15.74,9.06,4.01,6.3,2.1,19.18,5.82,4.01,1.34,1.15,2.29,6.11,1.53,4.01,0.29,1.72,0.86,11.26,2.19,0,1.34,4.1,14.22,3.05,1.62,2.1,2.67,1.43,4.48,3.05,0.38,0.29,2.29,2.58,0.86,1.43,0.29,0.1,7.54,2.19,1.53,1.62,2.1,0.76,5.82,10.21,0.95,12.69,1.72,5.34,5.82,0.19,0.48,0.67,0,0,0,0.29,0,0.1,0,0.1,0.1,15.84,5.15,4.87,0.19,0,0,0,0.1,0.38,3.53,1.53,0.1

g01n07,Is this abuse?,"I always had a bad relationshio with my dad. He never was phisicaly violent with me but he used every words in his avantage. For exemple when i would point out his meastakes he would get realy angry and denied it. when someone did something romg toward him and i was trying to explain to him why they did it, like a guard who was in charge of telling people where they could not be , he would say that im disloyal and that those horible person whould be so happy to know that even his own daughter is ahainst him and on thier sides. When i was the one doing a mistakes, i never knew how he wojld react, sometime he was understandable and helpfull , some time he was anoyed  and cold for a few days , sometime he didt show anything and sometime he was realy realy mad  but he would always used it against me later. And when i talk about when he was mad, its not about when i did realy realy bad stuff, once he was FURIOUS that i used all the maole syrop to do a cake.  He always higlighted everyone of my mistakes and shamed me for them. His much better now but being around him stress me a lotl. When he make me angry or sad or suck all the energy i have, he say that i have mental healness and that if i cant behave his gonna drive me to the spycological hospital. Every thing that he can use to make him self in controle he is gonna do it caus he like to feel like im a stuoud child and his in charge. When i try to talk about it he react like a child, trowing tempertantrum ,screaming, trowings things,banging on things, saying snarky  things and sometime straight up insulting me. Here if i breath rong idk how his gonna react and when he react like a normal person i feel stupid to have been aprehensive but when he get mad i feel stupid that i made a mistake.

g02021,Was I sexually assaulted or did I feed into it?,"For some background info, I’m not interested in sex until a serious relationship. I downloaded tinder because I was getting bored in isolation and just wanted to talk to people. For reference, I am still at school as the dorms are still open but nothing else on campus is. Virtually no one is on campus compared to before, hence why I was so lonely. It wasn’t a smart idea to get on tinder in the first place, but that is where I made the first mistake. 

A guy messages me on tinder and we exchange snapchats. He later snaps me and says he is in one of the main campus buildings because he is a custodian, and that I should come visit. I knew what this may mean and even though I didn’t want to have sex I still went. I know this wasn’t smart, I don’t know what I was thinking. We started talking, no one is around in the maze of hallways because the school is closed, so he wasn’t worried about being caught not doing his work. I told him I didn’t want to do anything and he seemed okay at first. He then made a move and I was reluctant but stupidly gave into a kiss. As he began to do more, I started saying “no” or “I can’t”, or “I don’t know, I don’t want to”. I’m very shy and not confrontational at all so I was having a hard time being firm with my “no’s”. I’ve also never been put in this situation before so I was a little scared of what he would do If I said “no” too forcefully. What he was doing felt good and my body was reacting to what he was doing, but I didn’t want to be. My mind did not want any of this to happen and I’m disappointed I let it get that far. I thought saying “no” enough times and not reciprocating anything would get him to stop. This lasted maybe an hour of him trying to “convince” me to have sex. I finally got him to stop when I said my curfew is at 12:30 and residence life will be mad if I’m at my dorm any later. We never had sex but I’m convinced something could have happened if I hadn’t of said this, although if he wanted to rape me he probably already would have at that point. I got back to the dorm and I’ve never felt dirtier, I immediately took a shower and I still feel sick because I can still smell him on me. I feel super violated and am very upset. 

Is this sexual assault? Or was I feeding into it because of my reactions even after saying no?",Ardentcaribou,2020-04-12 11:30:58,2,472,6.7,8.1,86.23,2.77,18.15,11.86,95.76,65.68,20.76,15.89,11.44,0.64,0,3.81,0,4.87,3.6,11.65,14.41,6.99,9.53,5.51,25,4.66,2.12,1.69,1.69,1.06,5.51,1.48,4.03,1.06,1.48,0.64,8.26,0,0.21,0,4.03,18.22,3.6,2.54,3.6,4.24,1.06,5.93,2.75,0,1.48,1.06,2.54,0.21,0.42,1.48,0.42,5.72,1.48,1.27,0.64,1.69,0.64,9.53,11.44,0.64,13.98,1.27,6.14,6.78,1.91,0.21,1.06,0.21,0,0,0.42,0,0.21,0.21,0,0,15.68,4.87,2.97,0.21,0,0.64,0,0,2.97,4.03,0,0
g02bo4,Is this abuse or am I wrong?,"I’ve (20f) been living with my boyfriend (22m) of about two years for the past 6 months, and recently the emotional abuse and taunting has gotten so bad. I kind of got kicked out of my mom and her new husbands house so I really don’t have anywhere else to go, but I’m starting to really wear down and I’m looking to strangers for opinions now.
I ask for certain behaviors to stop (like him calling me “bitch” for no reason, or throwing a punch at his controller after a bad video game, etc.) and it doesn’t seem cease or even slow down no matter how many times I make a point. Even after I have a conversation/argument about how he is making me feel, it just gets turned around like “oh why do you let words get to you? Just get over it. I don’t mean it.” Or, “why are you making me feel terrible? You’re really making me want to kill myself for making me feel like shit.” Or even “Wow I’m going through so much right now and you’re going to treat me this way? I can’t believe you.” And I’m to the point where I can’t take this anymore... I’m going through my own mental health issues and he knows this. I don’t know what to do and I don’t have many options. I love him so much but I’m tired of always being the bad guy after the argument and always being wrong, even when I know that I’m right.. It’s not everyday that this kind of thing happens, but it’s starting to happen more and more often and I’m not strong enough to handle both of our emotions like this.

When I was younger, so young I can’t remember MUCH but I remember ENOUGH. My brother kept trying to make me put my mouth on his.. yano... and I remember telling him no no I don’t want to but he made me anyway. He was a child too so I don’t know what that says. he’s 3years older than me. A friend who wasn’t really a friend (a boy), we were in primary school.. behind a little wall. He was on top of me with my shirt up and feeling my breasts. Telling me we’re playing doctors. The teacher caught us and my mum found out. We’ve never talked about it. EVER.

g061rw,Is my gf manipulating me?,We've been together for 6 years. Anyway we were talking about the virus and then somehow the topic of a possible ww3 came up. I told her that I would join military if that happened because I would feel obligated to do it and she got angry with me and accused me of not caring about possibly leaving her alone and grieving. I said that people in history had to deal with that too and it was a little bit entitled and selfish of her to only think about her own hypothetical grief when her whole country in this case would be at stake. She then just told me she would kill herself immediately if I joined a potential ww3 because ppl who go to those wars have a low chance of survival. I feel like she's trying to manipulate me into doing what she would want in that situation but I'm not sure because she could really be serious about killing herself because of the high chance that I wouldn't make it home. I really need to know if this is a controlling/abusive/manipulative tactic or if she was within her reason to say what she said,throwawaygftrouble1,2020-04-12 15:17:18,4,204,16.99,55.84,4.46,1,25.5,16.67,93.14,64.22,23.53,16.18,7.35,0.98,0,7.84,0,7.35,3.92,13.24,10.78,6.37,9.31,1.47,21.08,2.45,0.49,1.96,0.49,0.98,6.37,0.98,5.39,0,2.45,1.96,14.22,0,0.49,8.33,0,20.59,2.45,4.9,6.37,6.37,0.49,4.9,2.45,0,1.47,0.98,0,0,0,0,0,9.31,2.94,1.47,4.41,0.49,0,6.86,8.82,1.47,10.29,1.47,5.88,2.94,0,0,0.49,0,0,2.45,1.47,0,0.98,0,0,0.49,6.37,2.94,0,0,0,0.49,0,0,0,1.96,0,0.98

g06dft,My brain feels scrambled (CW: Mentions of self-injury),"Not even her gradually coming to terms with the gravity of her actions brings solace. Displays of resentment on my part are still subject to teasing and dismissal from my parents (though my stepfather is ignorant to our history together). People praise my mother for going out of her way to provide things for me I didn't want in the first place, to the point of blatantly rejecting and only going through with it out of lack of alternatives. She's the hero. All I am is dependent, nutty, and ungrateful.

It's come to the point where I enjoy the insults and hitting during (now rare) outbursts. First, it proves she isn't what she makes herself out to be at the moment. Second, it provides reassurance that I'm not crazy. Third, all the more reason to seek sympathy, despite rarely opening up about my issues due to shame.

I lack an identity outside of how others perceive me. I attach myself to whatever receives approval in the moment and cling to it as though my life depended on it. My self-esteem is directly proportionate to people's perceptions. I am tolerable when people like me and worthless and suicidal when they are indifferent. How to survive without validation without entirely self-isolating is beyond me. People were supportive when I first began to open up about my experiences. Sympathy - AKA what nobody supplied me as a kid - is of course my weakness. My identity became the victim/survivor. I am not happy unless I am miserable. I deliberately dwell on memories I previously wanted to forget about to induce depressive episodes. I self-injure to produce a semblance of that pain. Happiness causes insecurity and feelings of invalidation. I deliberately self-destruct during the good days in hopes of bringing about depression (one occasion which nearly caused my death). As if that wasn't enough, it makes me jealous to see others receiving support, thanks to my own unwillingness to open up and fear of losing support after years of lacking it. I don't want to be happy because nobody gave me the chance to be upset. Healing drives me bonkers as a result. Maybe I am making it up after all.

Yet I want to hurt others going through similar experiences the same way my family hurt me, though the idea is disgusting. I'm contemptful toward them, whereas I wasn't when first accepting what happened to me was fucked up (supposedly). Hearing about their experiences makes me feel like a wuss and an idiot at the same time. People would laugh if I tried to talk about mine again. They probably did before, assuming they weren't annoyed instead.

It also drives me bonkers when people act like they relate to my feelings, despite thinking, acting, and processing emotions like any other human being. Everything about me goes against nature. Even my newly accummulated 'normal' emotions are inconsistent and artificial, proportionate to my mental state. I don't think I can be a good person anymore. The contents of this post feel audacious as well, seeing as what normal people want to avoid appeals to me. Feelings of genuine lostness are addicting thanks to proving my experiences aren't trivial, even though I trivialise them regardless.

Sorry for the long post. I don't even want peace at this point as much as I'd rather be dead so as not to have these thoughts anymore.",bastardwretch,2020-04-12 15:36:17,0,579,54.57,16.24,91.37,5.5,14.48,22.11,91.71,55.79,18.31,12.78,10.19,0.17,0,1.21,1.21,5.53,4.15,18.31,7.08,6.74,6.74,2.94,14.68,5.01,3.45,2.42,1.21,1.38,9.5,3.63,5.53,1.21,1.55,1.73,8.81,0.69,0.35,1.38,0.17,15.37,3.8,2.42,2.59,1.9,1.55,5.18,3.45,0.52,0.35,1.55,1.38,0.52,1.04,0.17,0,6.39,1.04,1.55,2.76,0.35,0.86,2.76,10.88,0.69,13.82,2.25,5.7,5.87,0.35,0.17,0.17,0,0,0.52,0.69,0.52,0,0,0.17,0,16.06,6.74,3.11,0.17,0,0,0,1.21,0,2.94,1.73,0.17

I've tried to tell people, to talk to anyone that can do anything for her, but everyone thinks I'm exaggerating and then makes excuses for her manipulative, two-faced parents. They're very controlling people, her parents, and people love them. L and her family are very religious people, which is probably why they chose to keep her. They didn't want her, which is something that they have told her too many times, and every time it destroys a little more of her.

g09dll,"My Husband hit me today, I was in touch with Ex starting of relationship two years ago and I feel he hates me still because of it.","Hello Reddit Community. This is my first post here and I thought maybe you could help a woman who is in pain physically, even more emotionally.

My husband and I met through common friends. We liked each other and got into a relationship 1 month after. He never proposed marriage, but for us we felt it was the next step in any relationship since both came from conservative backgrounds. I was away from my home country, lonely and didn't have any friends. So I moved in with him because it felt like home and I never wanted to be away from him, trusting that we will get married. He told his family about me two months into dating. I was on top of the world! Both families started planning for an engagement after two more months, followed by wedding in a year. I liked this guy a lot and it was my dream to get married so I didn't have second thoughts at all. I was deeply depressed and this guy made me feel happy and loved after a long time.

In the background, I had a previous relationship that ended on good terms but I was still talking to my ex now and then. Why? He had some mental issues and he used to say he might commit suicide. I had moved on but I considered him a friend (I didn't have any other friends at all, he was my only friend who in the past became by boyfriend and then back to a friend). I just didn't want anything to happen if I stop talking to him. I did not tell my husband about it and I regret every day why I didn't. When he found out, he was shattered. I was deeply remorseful and immediately blocked all contact with the ex because I didn't want to lose what I had. I also gave my husband a choice if he wants to leave me he could, I deserved it. But he said he didn't want to hurt his parents who had started planning for the engagement so we continued.

I don't know if he became resentful and stopped loving me that point, or if it was in his nature to be unromantic, but I didn't feel loved. Then came verbal abuse - he did it because I told my mom about a fight despite him telling me not to tell her about our fights (I am very close to my mom so I couldn't keep that promise of not telling her). He called me shitty, questioned my character and also brought up a guy who had tried to take advantage of me. (I had told him about this guy because I hoped for some emotional support). He said he knows what girls like me do. I told him I want to die. He didn't bother. My colleagues at work saw me cry through meetings. It was mortifying. Later on parents got involved and we both apologized to each other.

Fast forward we get married and now and then have arguments. I had some rough experiences when he was teaching me to drive and made me extremely nervous if I messed up - so much so that I almost had a head-on collision in a parking lot. He has a habit of screaming like a madman when he gets angry. He gets very uncouth. I have told him thousands of times to not talk to me like this but he doesn't change.

Yesterday while driving we were having an argument and he again yelled like a madman. I lost my patience and asked him ""Have you learnt this from your family"". And that was it. Like a raging bull he lost all sense. Accelerated from 50 to 100 mph and pulled my hair and tried to thrash my head on the gear stick, just pushing enough to not hit my face with it. Later on he said that because I dragged his family into the argument, he did it. Again an argument Also threatened to do it again if I drag his family again into arguments. A day later he was remorseful and said he didn't mean it. He applied ice to my injuries and cooked all meals, took me to the doctor.

He had been violent with me two months before - he strangled my neck twice. That was the first time and I thought maybe its a mistake, he will realize it. I said that I won't tell anyone about it but if this happens next time, everyone will know. I used to tell everything to my mom but he started to discourage it and gradually I stopped telling my parents about our fights. I thought he will appreciate me since I didn't tell them about the strangling.

There have been a lot of happy moments since we have been married. But some things that make me sad. I do notice he never brings me flowers even though he orders them online for his mom and dad on their birthdays. He never did an actual proposal by going down on a knee before marrying me. It was our engagement anniversary and he didn't plan anything. I never received any surprises or the small gifts that I see other wives getting. He has been faithful - I trust him with everything. But he has broken my trust by hurting me physically and emotionally.

I told the doctor everything. He urged me to leave. And said if you do think you want to continue, you have to give an ultimatum that he gets anger management therapy and that if it happens again the cops will know. I just told him this and the reply was: ""I don't have time for therapy"" and he threatened that he will also file a complaint against me: pressing charges of injuries he will self-inflict as evidence that I hit him. I know he is trying to scare me just like I am trying to scare him with the law. I have said that the ball is in your court.

It has been just 5 months into marriage. I don't know what to do. Bottom line: I don't want to be lonely again, I have no friends and don't socialize much. Anyone who has gone through a similar situation? What should I do?",sensitiveButStrong,2020-04-12 18:48:11,51,1084,17.49,64.75,52.68,4.81,15.27,14.94,94.56,61.53,24.72,18.54,10.15,1.11,0.65,6.37,0.28,6.18,4.15,11.81,9.41,5.26,7.75,2.86,20.76,2.77,1.94,1.29,1.2,2.4,5.72,1.85,3.87,0.46,1.85,1.29,19.28,2.31,1.29,0.83,7.1,13.38,2.68,1.57,2.21,3.14,1.66,4.15,2.31,0.18,0.92,1.01,1.75,0.74,0.83,0,0.18,9.32,4.89,1.38,1.57,1.2,0.83,9.87,8.67,1.66,13.01,1.85,4.43,7.01,0.83,0.83,0.65,0,0.09,0.18,0.46,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,11.99,6.18,1.85,0.28,0,0.28,0.09,0.55,0.37,1.85,0.55,0

&amp;#x200B;

1. My childhood, my dad never worked once during my childhood just sat around the house and drank. He would sometimes take us to a nice casino but I think he just liked to gamble there. Anyway on one of the times we was headed home and saw my grandpa who we lived behind walking back from our house. We stopped and I talked to him, when we got to our house and I went to my room and for some reason started crying, I guess I missed my grandpa cause hes one of the only people to show me love. So my dad comes in and asks whats wrong and I told him I missed my grandpa and he said ""I just took you to a nice place and you miss your grandpa!!"" and went off starting to beat the shit out of me leaving me there to cry in pain on my bed.
2. I don't remember this because I was too young but My grandpa told me one time that when I was about 5 I was visiting them and I went to get in the tub and they said I had spoon marks on my butt. from a normal metal spoon, which was odd because if my dad was going to spank us he usually made us go get one of the big wooden spatulas not a small normal metal spoon. So my grandpa marched me down to my house and asked my dad what that was on my butt and my dad said it had happened a week ago, and never gave a reason. My grandpa also said he was completely drunk staring off into space at the time.
3. He consistently everyday would lock us outside to play and would let us in from  morning till dark not for food or bathroom, we literally dug a hole in our backyard to piss and shit in.
4. I used to play soccer and we had some big 3 hour tournament and I was like 6 or 7 and I played offense. So after about 2 and a half hours in I switched to defense out of exhaustion. After the tournament ended I ran to our car and got in kinda happy, expecting my dad to be proud of me like I had seen on TV, and when I got in all he said to me was, ""I'm gonna pull into a abandoned parking lot when it gets dark and whip you cause you switched positions.""
5. I remember one time when my parents got into a really bad argument like always but this time my dad ran out of the house into his car while my mom was running to his car door, and my brothers and sister were crying and starring out the window and I remember standing back and smiling, feeling almost happy that he might finally be out of our life.

And this is what my childhood consisted of, except for one moment out of all of these that hurt the most. It was an evening and for some reason he was mad at me I guess and he was punching me and beating the shit out of me on the couch in the living room, and I remember 2 things, 1 I wasn't even worried about what was going on I was worried cause I was pissing myself and didn't want to ruin the couch and get in more trouble later. And 2 My mom was there at the dining table next to me doing work, and I remember looking up to her with him on me yelling ""HELP!"" and she just looked at me emotionless and ignored me, went back to her work, and I didn't give a fuck about him but she's my mom... I thought she would care.

During this he didn't have a job for all 9 years while my mom was just a barista so we missed water bills and didn't always have money for a lot of food. But I still had my grandparents who lived near me and a best friend at school and my half-brothers who lived nearby and if we had stayed there I might have still gotten to experience love from them and care, but then we moved away when I was 9 so the only 2 people I cared about and would have gotten to feel love and compassion from I was torn away from. We moved to a big city where my dad still didn't work so I guess he didn't work for 10-11 years really. But here without my grandparents or brothers or friends, I was completely alone, a father who beat me and I hated, a mother who doesn't like me, and a sister who always tells me she hates me. 

1. Here my dad got really drunk every night and I remember he would freeze fruit and throw them at me every night bruising my legs and even there my mom would be just as drunk laughing at me.
2. This one is a really big one I've struggled with and just started to realize what had actually happened. One night my dad comes in my room drunk as always and says lets prank your mom, so I go okay not wanting to get beat or anything, so he takes me to their room and tells me to hide under the covers and when I hear her, jump out. So I do when i hear her voice I jump out, and what I saw was she had just got out of the bath and was butt naked with her tits right in front of me, and I can't forget it, it always plays in my mind and I hate it, it's disgusting.

Now we live somewhere else and the whipping and beatings stopped except when he grabs my shoulder and squeezes until it hurts. Now he just gets insanely drunk and won't leave me alone almost every night. I've heard him get in fights with my mom and I still care about her for some reason and it's like torture hearing him hurt yell at her and scream and push or hit her.

And hate the world all the time cause if we just stayed where we lived the first time maybe I would feel love from my grandparents or have fun with my brothers and my friends. Even now my sister screams she hates me and my mom says to get away from her and she doesn't want to see me cause I ""Annoy her""

Now I just always feel alone and bored and sad and I hate him so much I start shaking with rage, I never wanna be around him, and whenever i get in my feels I cant cry or anything I just feel so numb and alone.",MajesticImagination,2020-04-12 19:13:50,1,1182,22.25,43.61,86.98,3.03,26.86,9.31,94.67,59.98,21.57,18.19,11.51,2.03,0.51,3.72,0.42,3.3,3.89,12.77,6.68,7.28,11.08,1.69,18.87,2.88,1.1,2.03,2.79,1.44,7.02,2.28,4.74,0.34,1.86,1.61,13.37,3.21,0.25,2.45,4.4,10.49,1.69,1.1,1.44,2.71,1.61,3.47,3.55,0.85,1.44,1.1,3.38,1.02,1.02,0.25,0.93,7.61,3.55,0.93,1.35,1.78,0.59,8.88,7.78,0.76,16.24,2.62,7.28,6.68,0.68,1.35,1.52,0.34,0,0,1.27,0.85,0.17,0.08,0,0.08,9.73,3.47,2.79,0,0.17,0.25,0.34,0.17,0.68,1.69,0,0.17

g0h0pf,I was abused by a married couple.,"Brand new here. Not looking for sympathy, love, a ""community,"" or any of that stuff. I'm simply looking to see how many others have had similar situations as me. 

When I was 12, I had a church youth leader and taekwon do instructor reach down the top of my basketball shorts and twiddle my penis with his fingers. I had gone over to his house (with his wife there) and fell asleep on his lap. I woke up during it, didn't know what to think, made eye contact with him, and ""went back to sleep."" It was messed up. He continued to rub me genitals.

The next day I told my dad and step-mom (who is a terrible person). They took it seriously, but didn't involve law enforcement. Instead Jeremiah (the sex abuser), my dad, my step mom, the head pastor, and myself had a meeting togrther. Basically, he was released as being a church youth leader, and was told to not be around me. No police report.

I still looked up to Jeremiah. He had a grip on me, he was my friend. He manipulated me and took advantage. Fast forward 1 year, and my step mom kicks my dad out (now he is living in a van), which means I'm kicked out. I needed a place to go. Where do I choose? Jeremiah's house, who by the way has a wife and two little boys. 

In that time, he began molesting me again, around age 14. It started with perverted jokes, then suggesting what celebrities were hot, suggesting porn sites, giving tips on how to obtain the best orgasms, then masturbating together, then giving each other handjobs, eventually blowjobs, and cumming in each other's mouths. It was awful, but for some reason seemed to enjoy it. I was so manipulated, I some how thought I enjoyed it. It makes me sick now. I thought ""I must he gay."" Even though I never checked dudes out, looked at gay porn, etc. At school I always hit on girls and checked girls out. Never men or boys. It's messed up.


Anyways, ways down the road, his wife becomes interested in me when I was 16. Eventually we have sex. Tons and tons of sex. Again, in hind-sight, it was miserable. I wanted to kill myself. Seems like it should be awesome for a 16 year old boy to be doing a 30 year (for some teens i suppose), but not me. I was just fucked up from all the abuse from her husband.

Fast forward a few months. I was 17. He was 35, and she was 30. I felt so guilty for having sex with a man and woman, who were spouses, I admitted it to both of them. Her reaction was disgust and saying she hates me, his reaction was pulling a knife on me and threatening to kill to for sleeping with his wife (Logical right?). Long story short, I had two options, stick with them, or be on my own. I had no money, car, or anything. So I stuck with them, but that meant having a three way all of us together. Jeremiah said ""The only way I can see getting pass this is by all of us doing it."" So we all had a dirty nast orgy together for a few months. Yes, a husband (35) and wife (30) decided to both together have sex with a 17 year old boy, AFTER both separately molesting and raping him.

I never told anyone. How could I? Until I met the love of my life at age 21. After 1 week of seeing her I knew I needed to tell her, because I KNEW, there was potential of us getting married. Of course, she comforted me, told me it wasn't my fault (which was shocking to hear), and eventually I reported them to the police. 

She has plead guilty and for some fucked up reason doesn't get jail time AND GETS TO KEEP HER KIDS, and he is facing trial on May 11th, 2020. He is very likely going to prison.

Anyways, anybody else had something similar or even more fucked up?

Sorry for typos.

P.S. I am 22 now, and my fiance and I are getting married in 6 months. She is a blessing, I love her ❤

g0mi5d,I currently live in the same house as the male who assaulted me when I was a kid. I told my family about it before and I don’t know what to do now,"I am the youngest of three. At the time my mom got married, I was 8. Months after my mom got married, her husband attempted to have sexual advances with me. I remember three advances. Even though I didn’t know exactly what was going on, I knew something wasn’t right, so I either made an excuse or push/kicked him. Ever since then, throughout elementary school, middle school and now high school, that incident would always be at the back of my head, but I never had the strength to tell anybody. I was too embarrassed. I kept feeling like either I’d make a situation worse than it actually was or simply that no one would care. Especially at the time when it happened, I didn’t want to ruin my moms marriage since it was right after she got married. So I’d kept that secret, unfortunately. I regret ever doing that. A few years ago, in middle school I decided to tell my sister about what happened, as it was getting increasingly obvious that I despised him. After that, nothing really changed. Now, I’m 17. In December, I overheard him speaking with a woman, which was obviously suspicious. I told my mom, and one thing led to another, and I ended up telling the rest of my family about what happened years ago, mother and brother. Both were shocked and my mom, being religious, started to come in my room every night to pray. Honestly, it was the first time I actually felt like my family truly cared about my feelings. I am used to them brushing things off and not really taking my problems seriously. I thought that my mom would confront him, or at least treat him differently after I told her. But, instead she worried about how this news would ruin his reputation and how my accusation would ruin his life. She seemed genuinely conflicted, but after a while, by the end of the month, everything went back to the way it was, like what I told them never even happened. In fact, they treat him regularly, talking to him like he’s not a terrible person, treating him the exact same as before. Honestly, this makes me feel so little, so insignificant. And now, more than ever, we’re all stuck in the house 24/7 and I can’t take it anymore. I just want him to stop existing. To die of the disease, preferably. Sometimes, I feel like it didn’t actually happen, and I was just hallucinating. I absolutely and completely lost.

Anyways, yeah I may need to seriously move somewhere else, but I have nowhere to stay, all my family members have the same way of thinking so I have no safe person. I might be able to reach out to someone even if I'm not close to them. I have one contact of a former classmate I still text. It feels like a one sided relationship but I'm just whatever at this point. If I have to burden someone then oh well they'll know it's for a legitamate purpose and I need to start putting myself first more than ever. I just hope their parents udnerstand and won't cause a fuss.

g0qa36,Called CPS (again) and 911 on my neighbour,"Hi all. 
I have called CPS on my neighbour before and today it was bad. 

I woke up and made my coffee and the mother, as per usual, is shrieking at her kids, berating them, slamming doors, throwing things. I have been recording these things. As an abused person myself, it is really triggering and I had a panic attack listening to her be abusive. This is the 3rd time in a few months I have called CPS (my own experience is that they’re pretty useless and only really get involved when it’s just physical; emotional abuse goes unnoticed plenty). Anyways, made a report. Called dispatch and told them what’s going on. They gave me the option to be anonymous and asked if I wanted to speak with them when they arrived to which I said no. I have already been abused by this lady myself, and I fear greatly for her children. She likes to pretend she’s a nice lady to others but behind closed doors she’s a an absolute terror. 

She breaks the law in other ways and she is known in the neighbourhood for harassing people too. I highly suspect she is a narcissist. 

I knew I needed to leave for my own mental health and the cops were coming to do a check on the kids. They arrived as I left with my dog to go to the store. 

What else can I do? I assume just keep calling the police when I hear it occur. 

Please help. Thanks.

Edit: not only is she abusive, but her kids (particularly the older one who gets most of the abuse—perhaps he’s the scapegoat) scream bloody murder. It’s absolutely not normal. There are other kids in the building who act like normal kids and cry like normal kids and I never ever hear anything bad. Just normal. But this lady I have reported more than once is a nightmare to her kids.

g0sw5a,Friend may have to leave the country due to abusive ex,"I have a friend whose ex is making her life a living hell and she doesn’t know how else to get rid of him other than to leave the country. I’m really looking for advice and also referrals of who to talk to about this. 

She immigrated here many years ago, had a house and sold it and went overseas to her original country. Met a man from a different country to this one and hers, and married him. It was not a happy marriage and he left her after he drained her of all the money she had from the sale of her house. 

She moved back here and then they got back together and he came on a spousal visa, however he raped her and she tried to get his visa cancelled. She became pregnant from the rape and had the baby, he stayed here and has been living with his sister who has been a resident for a long time. He has never met the child and is now taking her through court case after court case to try to stay in the country by saying he wants to see his child. He makes false allegations of abuse and stalking against her and has a temporary intervention order against her for it even though he provided no dates or times. He has a business here now but does not pay child support as he claims he makes little to no money from his business. 

She is tired of it all, feels that he used her to be able to come to this country, and doesn’t want him to be anywhere near her child. He also sexually interfered with his nephew and the father of this child is supportive of my friend (he is his brother) but it happened overseas and the court isn’t taking that into consideration.

She feels like her best option would be to leave this country and go back to hers because then he couldn’t stay here on a spousal visa and couldn’t argue he is here to see his child. Then divorce him and move back here, but doesn’t know if that will work. 

How does she get rid of him? Yes, she made some poor decisions but this guy is a monster and she is such a lovely person and a great mum. He child is 18 months old.

g0xmwx,My Ex,"I'm scared to talk about this. I don't know if this person uses this app and if he does, I don't know if he would even look here. I won't be using his  name of course but I want to talk about my past relationship. I don't know if it was abusive or not, that's kinda why I'm coming here to see what others think. My relationship with my ex haunts me and has made my current relationship hard at times. 

How me and my ex got together was by me preforming oral sex on him. I git scared, because people have used me in the past for stuff like that, so I asked him if this was going to be a one time thing. He said we could try dating and we did. It seemed really good at the start, he treated me nicely, always wanted to come hang out with me and helped me in the best ways he could.

The relationship was very sexual. He liked sex, but so did I. So I didn't really mind his high demand for it. But as the months went by, I started to calm down. My high sex drive was dying down and I wanted to do other things with him, like just cuddle or go out for a walk, but his mind seemed to always turn around to sex. It got to the point where it would hurt because he wouldn't try and get me into the mood, he would just try to put it in. 

I never really denied him until after a year of dating. I started to just not feel anything sexual towards him, most of the time. I didn't want to have sex but he did. I would tell him no and he would get mad at me. Threw out the day he would randomly yell or be aggressive when I tried to talk to him. When I asked him what was wrong he would say "" I'm pent up, what do you expect."" It started to become normal for me to just shut up and let him do what he wanted so he wouldn't get mad at me or yell at me. 

Sexual stuff wasn't the only thing he did to me. He was extremely competitive. I like to do art, and I would like to believe my art is mid to high quality. My ex would try to one up everything I did, including my art. He would constantly nit pick my drawings and then make art of his own and best it around like it was so much better then mine. 

Any video gane we played, he had to be better. I stopped like Smash because of him. He said "" your just a causal player, you'll never be any good playing like that."" He would always ""style"" on me and make a big deal out of winning. "" oooooh oh my god I did you so dirty aha, sorry I hurt you, but that was so cool."" And any time I best him, he would say "" I just let you win"" or "" You cheated!!!"" Out of all the games we played, I maybe won 5 times. So I didn't want to play anymore. He got upset with me and told me it was just a game. Games are fun when you have a chance to win, He didn't give me a chance to learn.

Or if there was a game I was good at, like splatoon and splatoon 2. I'm pretty good at thoughts games. He went out of his way to learn every little thing about the game and studied every weapon so he could find the best way to beat me. Though, most games I beat him, he would scream and make a big deal out of it, calling me a cheater or trying not push my switch out of my hands or push me to try and mess me up so I wouldn't win. I was just trying to have fun but he needed to win every match or I was cheating and stealing his games. Happened with every game honestly.

I don't know if this all counts for abuse, but it really messed me up. Now in another relationship with someone who has a lower sex drive then me, I feel like I'm doing something wrong if I didn't have sex with them all the time.

g0y038,Unsure If It's my fault?? Dad is being Weird,"I (19F) don't even know what to say, I'm just so mad, at him and myself. Dad's a recovered alcoholic (three years sober), when I hit puberty I was bitchy (typical angsty teen girl), he thought I hated him, I'm adopted by him as well, so there's separation there ig. I would misbehave, he'd be REALLY angry, progressivly got worse as his drinking would get worse (around 6 years ago), would yell, swear, call me useless, bitchy, annoying, stupid, retarded, etc. I would get angry and yell back, we'd swear at each other. Eventually he got way more dominant as I got older and more gentle. I got anxiety from this shit, I think about how I do things wrong and that I'm a failure and I worry to the point of chewing inside of my mouth till it's raw and bleeding all day. He yells at me still (I'm 19, living at home because I'm still a student as I started kindergarten later than other kids), and I cry, and get awful anxiety attacks.

Today, I was on the laptop using a knitting pattern on pdf to knit a little lamb plush (i'm an arts n crafts type), and he asked me to clean the entrance while he was in town getting groceries. I cleaned the kitchen, but failed to clean the entrance. He cam,e home, I smiled at him, and he didn't smile back, proceeded to clean the entrance while throwing boots, coats, etc while swearing. He said I am only allowed 3 hours of internet a day from now on. Later, he said he'd turn the internet back on. I didn't care, fuck the internet if its such a bother. Mom was in kitchen, said it was messy, I said ""no, it's not too bad"" was about to offer to clean when my dad showed up swearing and yelling, while pointing at me and saying that I'm lazy, I can play for my own internet when I have my own place, he's the breadwinner, etc.  Apparently they were taking about turning it on when the kitchen was clean but I didn't hear that part of the conversation cuz I was talking to my little sister. I started crying, did my chores (farm family), and cried for about 2 hours.

I'm so confused and upset, what do I do???",dropdead-demigod,2020-04-13 20:30:26,3,401,19.64,24.24,67.3,1,21.11,13.47,89.53,54.86,19.7,15.96,11.22,0.25,0,4.24,0.25,3.74,4.74,10.97,10.72,7.48,9.23,1.5,20.45,7.48,2.99,1.75,1.25,1.25,10.97,1.5,9.48,1.5,4.24,1.5,9.98,1.5,0,0.75,4.99,7.23,0.75,1.25,1.5,1.25,0.25,3.24,2.99,0.25,2.74,0,2.99,0.75,0.75,0.25,1.75,7.48,1,1.25,2.24,2.24,2,7.23,9.98,0.25,14.21,0.25,7.23,7.48,1.5,1.25,1.75,0,0,0,1.75,1.25,0.25,0,0.25,0,24.94,3.99,10.47,0,0,1.25,0,0,0.5,5.24,3.49,0
g108of,The physical abuse from my childhood has my pain tolerance at a negative,"I didn’t know which subreddit to post this too but this one seems more appropriate. I’m going to make this as brief as possible but basically growing up i went through a lot of abuse in ALL aspects. I’m going to talk about my parents in reguards to my pain tolerance since their the ones who are the reason it is the way it is. 

My fAtHer used to beat me when my mom wasn’t home either for stupidness or just because he wanted to take his anger out on me. I used to get beat in the shower, hit with belts, lamps, shoes, fists, anything that was around, that when i was acting up i was getting thrashed with that object. Once my mom got so mad at me for stealing in school that when i came home she dragged me to my room and threw me on the floor that in the same token i hit my spine against the bunkbed we had which was metal. She proceeded to pound on me and told me not to steal anymore. After that i was forced to go too bed with no lunch. The same night i ran away for the rest of the night but came back in the morning cause i knew she would 1000% kill me foreal if she knew i left the house.


So many things happened throughout my childhood everyone ignored. The signs were there, i changed, and i became more not like myself but everyone thought it was “just a phase” or that “im getting my period.” 
When i would get beat i would make sure I provoked them even MORE so my beatings weren’t soft or lightly handed too me. Why? Cause fuck them thats why, if your going to beat me than make it count. Each time i became more and more numb too it, and since this happened so often when i was little, what even hurts anymore? The part that hurt the most wasn’t the beating, but when I wouldn’t even make a peep and they still continued to “teach me a lesson” all because evidently if I wasn’t making a sound, I wasn’t getting beat.

I still get beat by my mom but not as often or like when i was little. The emotional and mental abuse is still rapid every single day from her. I broke my foot and it didn’t hurt just was uncomfortable, when my mom punched me on the side of my face for speaking the truth about her I swallowed it like if it was a pill so I didn’t feel a thing. The anger problems i have is because of her. I’ll go from 0-100 so fast and not even know why, or what’s going on. My fuze is so short but at the same time I can’t let it run out because than me and my mom really going to brawl. If your messing with me or someone else I’ll most likely try to take you out rather than remove the threat. So much rage and anger I can’t put no where cause i live with demons 25/8. 

 My siblings ALWAYS want to jump on me and say “oh thats why you got anger issues and no one likes you” and stuff of that nature but like, didn’t you live in the same house as me right? Last time i checked you had the same anger problems i have.... so if we are throwing low blows than lets back track wtf makes you so unlikeable as well!


Just getting this off my chest cause I’ve been meaning to write out a lot of things related to my Childhood trauma, pains/ sufferings and problems so I don’t feel like I’m harboring it all plus it’s a weight off my shoulders since I don’t have anyone too talk to about it in the real world you know? At least online you can connect, and grasp more better with people you don’t know vs the people you DO know. Bot parties can  make you feel like crap but with online it’s easier to speak your truth. It’s not easy for me to be so open about what I endured as a child or even now to my family cause they all won’t believe me nor take me seriously. I just didn’t know where to start so Physical abuse is where I’ll start for now since it’s the most easiest to talk about. 

###If your dealing with any abuse from ANY aspect i know it’s hard and it feels like it’ll never get better but hold onto something that is or CAN keep you strong. If you’ve made it this far I’m sure you can keep going until your circumstance has a ticket out for some peace. What keeps me from blowing my head off and everyone else’s is keeping busy. With this quarantine it’s hard to get away from people obviously but do something you can distance yourself away from the problem. Hang in there and be strong for yourself and no one else. Go through your emotions and don’t shield them away. The more you do, the more they will come back ten times harder. So if anyone needs someone to talk too I’m always up for it 1000%%",zappleg,2020-04-13 23:18:12,21,900,20.8,18.41,93.07,4.95,21.95,10.22,93.33,62,22,15,10.22,0.33,2.67,1,0.78,7,4.78,14.22,9,7.67,9.33,3.33,18.44,5.56,4.56,2.44,1.33,3.11,5.89,1.89,3.89,0.22,1.78,0.56,8.22,1,0,1.33,0.33,17.56,2.56,3.44,2.33,4.22,1.89,6.33,2.22,0,0.44,1.78,2.22,0.89,0.89,0.11,0.44,5.33,0.78,1,1.89,2.11,0.56,5.22,11.56,1.33,14.11,2.78,6.22,5.56,0.56,0.33,0.89,0,0.11,0.11,0.56,0.33,0.11,0,0.22,0,12.78,4.11,2.11,0,0,0.44,0.11,0.11,0.89,4.11,0,0.89
g11aip,A jolly story about my mom.,"Aight so this happened a few weeks ago: I was drawing in my room and noticed it was getting dark out.

 So i wanted to go outside, before it was pitch black. (I'm 15) I asked my mom if i could and she said no. I asked why, and she goes 'Because. I said so, go back to your room.' I said 'C'mon, i need a better reason than that,' My mother yelled at me and i hid under the kitchen table. ( Not the first time something like this has happened)

 My mom stomps into the kitchen, grabs me by my hair and yeets me to the door and goes ' Get out. If you're gonna try and run away again, leave your phone here. It's mine.' so i get out, hand on my cheek, (which hit the door on impact, it hurt like hell. Ended up swelling) and noticed my neighbor.

 My neighbor knocked on my door, wanting to help me get back inside. My mom came out and claimed it was all a mistake.

g13iew,My opinion: mood and personality disorders are the result of early trauma. I share some stories of people I know as well as my personal childhood mental deterioration. I draw the conclusion that societal change is the answer. No drugs and no blaming imbalances or genetics. Trigger Warning - All.,"TLDR: I think that psychopathy, NPD, and all other personality and mood disorders are caused by trauma and not by chemical imbalances or genetics. I share numerous anecdotal accounts to give weight to my point and I share just how messed up my own psyche has been. I believe we should work on making the world a better place for children instead of having a society which churns out mental wrecks while wondering why the world around us is so messed up. Fix the root of the problem. Don't medicate or blame genetics. For mental health to improve, society has to change how children are raised and has to eliminate the massive amount of unnecessary trauma children suffer.


Hi there. I'm new here. I honestly haven't familiarized myself with the rules. Mods, please let me know if I'm doing something wrong.

So I've been slowly coming to terms with my own childhood abuse and how it affected me ever since I left home. I started feeling like things were wrong before I left, but I was very out of it at that time and had normalized so much of it.

I'm the kind of person who has an insatiable desire to understand. A large part of my recovery has been researching psychology and I've learned so many things.

I'm going to assume you are all familiar with the ACE score, and I'll let you know my score is an 8. That will give you a general idea without diving into specifics. However there are some traumas not included in that questionnaire and I think I would score even higher if they were.

I was looking into all the different psychological behaviors which my parents exhibit and I've been playing couch psychologist (though I'm definitely not qualified) and I've noticed that my Dad has some strong psychopathic traits while my Mom is more of a malignant narcissist.

I know psychopathy is more of a criminally relevant diagnosis when sentencing is decided and the labels for general usage and treatment decisions are ASPD among a few other labels. But it seems like the lack of empathic behavior and the resultant cruelties is more pronounced in a psychopathy diagnosis where ASPD encompasses many different facets of antisocial behavior.

I've also had a string of bad relationships which were enabled by a lack of self awareness and putting up with behavior I'd normalised during childhood. Despite the additional trauma this has caused, I've come to know some of the worst of the worst. But that also gave me an opportunity to work on myself and understand the dynamics that were drawing me in to those types of relationships.

My parents would never tell me anything about their childhoods. I don't even feel like I know them, to be honest. I know what it's like to live with them, but they never told me anything about their past. I haven't even met any of the extended family because the part of the family I grew up with kind of kept to our own neck of the woods.

But those who have the same behavior, which I've been able to observe with a more neutral perspective after practicing mindfulness meditation for years, all seem to have things in common.

There was a guy I was dating whose behavior I can only describe as machiavellian and calculating. He wouldn't get to know anyone on an intimate level. He sees people the same way he sees objects. He gets to know you by testing you. It's almost clinical, like people are a specimen. But he hides behind a veneer so it wasn't easy to see at first and he's good at saying the right words at the right times to get your feelings going and throw off your judgment. He put me through the ringer almost as badly as my parents did. 

Just like my parents, I eventually realised that I never got to know him. Our relationship was based on me being extorted like a horse following a carrot. The carrot was the desire to be loved and he would withhold it just enough to keep me yearning to have my unmet needs met and dangle it again to draw me back in just to push me away. I put up with way too much abuse for this reason. A few really traumatic events which he deliberately timed ended up really messing me up. He initially built me up for months just to pull the rug out from under me in the deepest way possible and I figured out later that this was his end game the whole time.

I kept asking myself why someone would do this. Then I remembered some brief snippets of conversation and I realized that he was probably hurt the same way I was. (It's entirely possible though, based on how he operates, that these snippets of conversation were meant to make me draw a conclusion and feel empathetic towards him so that I would be less likely to retaliate, yeah that's how he works). But the gist of it is that he was a pretty neglected and abused child, although he didn't reveal details. But he talked about an older man who took interest in him and was giving him some of the things he was missing out on (attention, companionship, adoration, respect, food, and some of the things someone poor wouldn't be able to enjoy like a nice steak). 

Looking back at this, I think it's really likely that this older man ended up molesting and finally raping him. While manipulating him with the strong hooks of being the only source he had of getting his emotional needs met. I think he learned that love comes with that kind of a price. I think he was completely devastated and had no way to cope. He was really young and clearly had no support network. I think that he has an attachment disorder and the abuse happened when he was young enough that it severely interfered with his psychological development. In hindsight, he definitely has quite a few childlike qualities (impulse control issues, mood issues, the kind of stuff that probably contributes to bad situations because nurturing people see the child in him and end up wanting to help him). Unfortunately, I think this ruined him for life and I don't think he's going to get help, though he often says he will as a ploy to get you to stop calling him out. I think he's seeking out situations that are like the trauma he experienced, but he's putting himself in the role of the aggressor to feel safe. He has never gotten over it and constantly runs in go mode. He can't slow down.

There's another man I met online who, as I ended up finding out through an internet search, has been to prison for possession of child pornography. I think it was out of concern for the well-being of the general public and a morbid curiosity that I somewhat befriended him while keeping tabs on him just in case. I observed his behavior quite a bit and it turns out that he has some sort of a strange psychological helplessness. It's like he always has a million reasons in his mind why things won't work and he keeps himself trapped with limitations which don't exist anywhere except in his own head. I think the term ""learned helplessness"" applies. He also has a really pessimistic outlook. A really ""things are the way they are, ain't nothing can be done"" type of outlook. After getting to know him a bit, he admitted that he can't remember much of his childhood. 

However, his mother divorced his father when he was about 3 years old because she caught his father sexually abusing him. His mother isn't exactly a saint either. She is a total control freak and he bends to her every whim (even though he's in his late 40s). He's a very insecure man and gets frustrated easily. And he's still mommy's little boy in quite a few ways. He's just in such poor shape mentally and he won't get help. He doesn't share with mental health professionals even when he's forced to go. He admitted that he never told them about his own history of being abused. So he puts up walls that make him treatment resistant. I think he would most closely meet a diagnosis of BPD because he is manipulative but it also comes from some really deep insecurities. It's not out of I'll intent, although his behavior definitely hurts others.

I met another guy who I hooked up with a few times and it turned out that he had violent tendencies and I ended up getting assaulted. I won't go into details, but the nature of the assault put it in a grey area and it would have been a total he said she said, he knew exactly what he could and couldn't get away with. I kept in touch with him and didn't really hold it against him, though I should have, and he told me that when he was little his parents were emotionally absent and they used to send him over to the neighbors because they didn't want to deal with him. His neighbor was a girl and her dad was beating and raping her. He ended up getting beaten and raped too. 

But he would still go over to the neighbors anyway. He said it was because he ""needed the stimulation"" but he's also not the most self aware person. This started when he was really young and I think it scarred him for life. I think he was really going back because he cared about the girl and because he didn't have the kind of parents he felt safe telling what was happening. Or he told them and he didn't care. But he hits the textbook definition of a psychopath. (Going by the psychopathy checklist). On top of this he admitted to having some fantasies which are too dark and specific to describe. 

He lied to me and told me he was getting help and seeing a therapist. I looked him up online and it turned out he *is* a therapist. And he deals with vulnerable populations. So I worry he could be a predator going after the most vulnerable. But it's also possible his profession is the result of not being able to help himself and trying to subconsciously resolve his own trauma while trying to help others. But my experience of him was a violent, exploitative and extortionostic individual with ""excess glib and superficial charm"" all up and down. Viewed through the lens of a psychopathy diagnosis, he would check off most of the boxes. But I really think his lack of empathy came about from being in helpless situations and watching someone he cared about get hurt and getting hurt without being able to do anything about it. So his empathy switch is now permanently set to the off position. Because it's safer to feel nothing than it is to process a decade or so of severe trauma and work through the feelings he was never able to process because that would interfere with daily functioning.

I read up a lot on borderline personality disorder, psychopathy, ASPD and narcissism. Both of my parents have extremely pronnounced traits of some of these disorders. The list of ""bad"" men who came into my life have traits of some of those disorders. But I'm really questioning the current paradigm, especially when it comes to psychopathy. There seems to be a general consensus that it is primarily a genetic disorder. That there are problems in the part of the brain that processes empathy, fear, the startle response and theory of mind reasoning. But I'm really thinking, based on what I know about neuroplasticity, that it's entirely possible that the brain abnormalities are caused by changes in thought and emotional reasoning which originally came about when, as a small child, they were subjected to severe abuse and neglect (and I believe, in the case of psychopathy, seeing those close to them be hurt the most while being able to do nothing about it).

I myself have experienced some strong psychopathic traits. I've also expressed some strong narcissistic traits as well. I know that it's unlikely for a narcissist to ever admit this, but I was honestly in total denial until I got sucked into the first relationship I mentioned. My life was in danger and I was forced to painfully analyse what was driving me and come to terms with parts of myself I had long neglected. I had to go back to the drawing board with my strategy towards my own wellness. I had to keep myself out of a bad situation. Which involved having to actually dig up the roots of the issue. Though this is still a work in progress, I believe I've gotten a lot further than I ever would have if I hadn't been taken by force.

I looked back at my childhood and my own denial. I suffered so badly. I've had some times where the old feelings came back and things switched on which had been switched off before. The series of events in my adult life also served as a much needed trigger to cause everything I'd repressed to come flooding back in.

I remembered when I went numb as a kid. It had gotten to the point where things weren't right and I knew something was wrong with me. I stopped feeling certain things. I kept dissociating to the point where I sometimes forgot where I was.

I remember that there was a really long time in my life where I just felt like I only existed. I was just alive to eat, sleep and go to the washroom. The whole purpose of life was just to exist and avoid pain and it would eventually come to an end. Day in and day out I existed in an existential void. I'd still take care of myself but everything was meaningless. I stopped experiencing joy. I started going after other feelings. Primarily adrenaline. I took up snowboarding and mountain biking. But I also started chasing all kinds of intense feelings. I knew things weren't right with me but I somehow didn't really care because it was a fucking relief. I also remember feeling alone. I could be around tons of great people and still feel like I was just empty.

Physical sensations became my everything. I'd enjoy the sun on my skin, the feel of the wind, and sand between my toes. But people became a weird mystery that I wanted almost nothing to do with.

I got to that point after years of fear and neglect. Every thought I had was painful. Every action I took just generated more pain. When I slept I had terrible nightmares of death and mayhem. I hoped to get out of the situation. But nothing I did worked and for some reason I was always hesitant to tell school or the authorities about it. I think it was because of fear of my Dad.

I started having two different fantasies, which I now find even more interesting, because there was someone who studied psychopathy and they noticed a few things in common with the childhood fantasies of psychopaths who hadn't met each other, and these are almost as described.

In one fantasy, I would wake up and everyone on Earth would be gone. I'd walk empty streets and feel the physical sensations and enjoy the fact that there were no other humans to ruin my day. I'd eat canned food out of the grocery store. I'd walk around Manhattan and go up into the empty offices and just dig around and do whatever. But there was this great relief that everyone was gone. Like I'd somehow be better off. A light feeling taking the strain of human interaction out of my existence and allowing me to recover and feel joy.

In another fantasy, I had developed the technology to have a self sustaining platform that just hovered in the sky. It flew like an alien spaceship. It was cut off from the world and had everything I needed to live. It just floated through the sky drifting wherever the wind would take it. It was airtight and completely sanitary. No bacteria allowed. Such an enticing and liberating feeling of being able to wake up and eat and live without the oppression of the human race.

These are the type of fantasies children develop when they can't take it anymore and their suffering is caused by other humans.

Everything eventually shut down. I started to feel different from other people and like no one ever could or would understand.

Then things got really strange. I woke up one day and people didn't look the same to me anymore. It's hard to describe, but it was sort of like people were just animated bags of flesh that made noise. I could see them and hear them and smell them and feel them. But there was no longer an essence. It was almost like everyone was a zombie who just went about a normal routine instead of cannibalizing people. It wasn't psychosis, I still knew what was real and I wasn't seeing things. I just wasn't feeling them as being alive like I used to. The psychological feelings that come with human interaction were gone.

I would still feel things related to some forms of companionship and caregiving. It felt good when there was food on the table the few times it was. I was thankful for being warm in the winter. I chose friends who were mentally stimulating. But it was more like my friends were my little interesting trinkets and I developed control issues. Though I was subtle about it for the most part, aside from assaulting a girl in my class for the crime of taking up space I had reserved for myself. All she wanted to do was sit next to her friends. But I didn't want to move. It was a public space. I was there first. Bam. Shot to the face. And then I was mad at everyone else for their reaction to it.

I got ostracised at school. Kids all called me a psycho.

I also developed some weird obsession for the rules. I think somehow human behavior wasn't at the core of my driving force. It was like the rules were everything. They kept me safe. It didn't matter if what I did was antisocial as fuck as long as it wasn't against the rules. I remember my Dad becoming alarmed when I started asking all kinds of odd questions. They were basically questions like whether it was morally wrong to kill someone if you were legally in the clear but didn't get caught.

I think I had getting away with it or it being lawful mixed up with something being moral.

Like I'd think it would be okay to run someone over with a car on purpose if it got ruled to be accidental and you just got your license suspended. (I was about 8 years old when I was asking those questions).

I also started getting what people thought of me mixed up with who I was. Like it didn't matter if I was the worst person as long as people thought I was a well behaved child. I was really smart too, so I got away with a lot of shit and never ended up with a criminal record or anything.

I hated the lunch hour supervisor for ruining what was really the only free time I had. I got an ice chunk and put it in a snowball and threw it at her head so hard it made her bleed. But I had the reputation of being a well mannered child after fixing my image after the ""punch the girl in the face"" incident the previous year. I waited until there was a kid between me and her and I hurled the ice chunk in the snowball as hard as I could and then I sat down in the snow and turned around so it looked like I was just sitting there playing in the snow. She assumed the other kid did it and he got in so much shit. I remember the feeling of getting away with it and it was the best feeling ever. It gave me power.

I'd also get things confused. My parents decided not to let me try boxing when the questions I was asking were setting off alarm bells. I thought the point of fighting was to win the fight. I asked questions like if you would get in trouble if you knocked them dead. Because, in my mind, that would have been a strongly possible outcome. One time when I was at the lake an older kid was going around asking little kids to hit him. Everyone was doing it half-heartedly and going along with it. At that time, when I had a goal in mind, the goal would overshadow everything. He said he wanted to see who could hit the hardest. Everyone was sort of having fun. When it got to be my turn, I asked everyone around if I would get in trouble or not and if it was okay to hit him. The general consensus was that it was fine because he was asking for it. So I wound up and punched him so hard that he doubled over and was gasping for air. I think I actually injured him. And I was a small kid too. Well, I won. The point was to hit the hardest. I did it. Even though I was skinny and short and malnourished. 

I guess that was also my thought process for boxing. If the point was to win, it would make way more sense to punch someone in the face so hard. I also had a strange obsession with biology so I knew where the bad spots were and I knew what brain trauma was (I read a lot of national geographic and reader's digest as a child).

I also started reading books about serial killers when I was about 9. It started because I read a really dark adult version of Batman in a book. It was a very twisted work. There was murder and rape and I wanted more. My family was at the thrift store and my mom let me buy a bunch of books about serial killers. They'd all been dropped off at the same time.

They were definitely not kids books but my mother was also a terrible parent. They had graphic descriptions and some had pictures. I remember quite clearly that there was a story of a man who raped and murdered a woman. Including ramming a broken post into her vagina. I think they determined that the injury was pre-mortem as well because of blood coagulation or something like that (yeah, I understood this stuff when I was 9, I was a very logically adept kid despite a lack of healthy socialization). I think it was because my mother pushed me way too hard academically. I also had the strong desire to understand everything. Which I think was my way of staying safe.

Anyway, I was reading all these books on serial killers. People always remember the name of the murderer and never the name of the victim. In some sick way I actually admired Ted Bundy.

I read those books and I also took out a bunch of books on forensic science. I guess I had loosely started to wonder if I could get away with it. I think I had the right mind to do it. Not so much the rape part as things like that weren't really a turn on (I was an oddly sexual child) but the murder part. I figured if I knew how law enforcement operated I could come up with a bulletproof plan. Probably involving ketamine because I knew I wasn't physically imposing enough to be able to beat someone down with a hammer and I figured breaking into a vets office would be easy. I toyed with the thought a lot though. I had about 30 or 40 half baked plans I would run through in my head (I wasn't writing anything down because that's evidence) but there would always be a snag. I was thinking very realistically.

I ended up getting rid of the books. Oddly enough, not because I was morally worried about what I would do. But I thought it through and realised that even if I got away with it, that would mean the entire rest of my life wondering if I would get caught. Having to have some plans in place to gauge if they were getting close and possibly going into hiding. All things I was nowhere near having the capability to do.

I also didn't want to spend the rest of my life with that kind of limitation. I didn't know yet just how poor the law enforcement agencies actually are at finding criminals. I didn't know about the million snags in the justice system.

I did have one point where I realised that it was weird that I had more concerns about the impact on me than I did about the thought of ending someone's life. The whole beauty of that seemed to come from the fact that I would be the one to decide that someone's entire life was mine for the taking. I would get the thrill and their entire life would end forever just because I willed it. The dichotomy was beautiful. The thought was powerful.

But I stopped. I talked myself out of it and reeled it in.

I did do one bad thing though. I starved my hamster to death. I didn't want to squish it because I was worried it would bite me and I didn't want to burn it because of the mess. So the poor hamster died. But it also did answer my question about whether or not you need food to survive or if that was just another lie my parents were telling me. I guess I quietly hoped that food wasn't necessary for survival and I could live out my days in the woods just chilling away from it all.

I also could never shake the feeling that I had had enough and needed a break and couldn't get one. I just wanted to exist in peace. But that wasn't happening.

I became rebellious, I broke every rule. I fucked around with drugs and never got addicted. It turns out that if you know what you're getting into and know what to expect you can do two massive crack hits and put yourself on the fucking moon and then just walk away from it. But you have to be willing to live with the disappointment of losing the thing you suddenly want more than anything else on Earth (which was easy because I've had that disappointment hundreds of times with my life experience).

I knew something was wrong with me and I remember the years from like age 2 and onwards where things kept going wrong and I could feel things getting worse. When I was really little I had recurring nightmares of my penis falling off and not being able to put it back on. I remember not telling my parents about it because I knew they would be no help.

I had violent nightmares and threatening nightmares. I had a recurring dream about a tsunami made of blood coming at me. I had a nightmare where my sister's severed head was in my bed (false awakening type) and I'd spend hours trying to hide it and my parents were coming home. I also didn't know where the body was and wasn't sure if I did it or not. Then I'd wake up.

Eventually the nightmares stopped and sleep became some strange thing. I'd just have weird abstract thoughts. No dreams. Or at least none I'd remember.

Sometimes I'd have wet dreams. But they would ironically be dreams where I was feeling uncomfortable. That would do it for me.

Eventually I'd just be focused on the present moment. Nothing else existed. But it was like a forced zen. Like a boring awareness of everything physical in my environment. The blankets warm. The air is fresh. I smell food. Because everything else was too much. And it numbed out. Just me. Just this strange empty world. Going about my day totally resigned and just waiting to die eventually. Not even really dreading it. I wasn't much afraid of anything as far as death goes. I'd like down on an ant hill in elementary school or play with wasp nests. Didn't matter. I just did my thing. It was like everything was neutral. But some things still mattered.

Frustration. I couldn't handle frustration. And I'd get frustrated easily. I couldn't handle someone showing me up or having more than I had. I couldn't handle social situations. Everyone would piss me off. I developed some weird superiority complex. Like I deserved my slice of cake and everyone was either an accessory or in my way. 

I couldn't handle getting bad grades. Even getting one question wrong and I would want to murder the teacher. I somehow equated the bad grade with me being inadequate.

Life was pointless and everything was empty otherwise. My main concern was making sure I'd get my piece of the cake so that I'd be physically okay. My quiet unspoken motto was that if I'm still breathing and my heart's beating, I'm fine. The rest didn't matter.

I remember one point where in a fit of rage after a really long period of feeling numb I ran my sister over with my bicycle. She ended up being okay. But I got in a lot of trouble.

The funny thing is in class I would always behave. But outside of class I was a menace. I won't go into details but some rules were badly broken. Some kids were either physically or psychologically damaged.

At some point things swung around. I started worrying more and more about what people thought of me. It was like the anxiety of my image being damaged became my main concern. Then eventually I couldn't maintain whatever the hell I was maintaining anymore. I started dissociating again. I started having multiple panic attacks a day and eventually couldn't function. I dropped out of school and ran away from home despite not really having anywhere to go.

I toughed it out. My whole life has been one giant mess. But somehow I'm working through it and I'm having more and more moments where I'm feeling joy and I'm happy and at peace. I'm having more moments where I'm actually caring for other people. I'm more relaxed and my guard isn't up 24/7 and things are shining through that I thought were gone.

But I have to get back to my main point, somewhere here. How does a kid end up that messed up? A good decade of severe mental, physical and sexual abuse from all adults I ever interacted with outside of a school setting. It wasn't some genetic thing. Both my parents and a family friend abused the living daylights out of me. It never stopped. If it wasn't one thing it was another. It was a terrible time. I don't know how the hell I got through it.

I'm now a ""functioning adult"" but I've learned the hard way that ""functioning"" is very different from ""happy and healthy"". On some level I've been functioning the whole time. I kept things under enough control that there were never any majorly serious consequences (so far, knock on wood).

But I'm going back to my main point again here. I'm getting strongly suspicious that a lot of messed up behavior isn't due to genetics. It's due to childhood trauma and neglect. It wouldn't make sense for human beings to be this mentally genetically defective at birth. Our species wouldn't have survived. We live in a world that puts increasing trauma and neglect on children (no villages left to raise a child as everyone thinks they're on their own) and a world that has increasing systems designed to keep things the way they are (accidentally or on purpose). And we are living in a culture that puts all the focus on materialism and success and no focus on happiness and spiritual growth.

I think it's weird that people put a focus on the chemical imbalance theory (which is quackery at best, it's not like when they give you a diagnosis they actually check your brain chemistry) or conveniently blaming genetics.

It makes no sense. I think the current paradigm is really just a way to make us not ask the hard questions. How messed up is life for children these days? Why are we not doing anything as a society to make this better? Probably because there's no money in it. There's money in daily medication. There's money in the drugs our drug dealers who we call doctors and pharmacists readily push. But there's no money in fixing the root cause of the issues. And it's inconvenient for everyone so we just ignore it.

When I started working on my problems, I started talking about them. I found out every single person I know suffered some form of neglect or abuse. Every single person I know has been sexually abused. This is way more common than people think it is. It's a pandemic. We need to fix this.

What we should probably be doing is taking care of the little ones. They should be our number one priority. The less focus we put on the struggles of small children, the more damaged individuals we churn out and the more damaged our world becomes.

Children are the future. Do you want a bunch of children like me running the place? Barely keeping it together and essentially psychologically and morally decrepit? Or do we want people growing up to be happy and healthy and able to contribute to a better world because they aren't absorbed by endless personal struggles?

g19o2c,"My ‘abuse’ is nowhere as bad as other peoples, and it can hardly be called that, yet it tears me apart","
Hello. I’m really sorry for making this post, and I’m really sorry for offending anyone when this may not even be abuse, I know how selfish it is of me but I wanted to get this off my chest, I’m sorry

I think my mother may have been sexually abusing me. As I was going through puberty, she comment on how my large my chest size was compared to everyone else in my family, despite the fact I was and still am flat. It made me so uncomfortable but she never stopped no matter how much I begged because ‘she was just teasing’. She did the same thing with my weight too and I feel incredibly uncomfortable eating around her. I’ll never be comfortable with my body and I wish I could be normal. My body isn’t mine.

Whenever I cried as a child she would threaten to record me and send it to my classmates to get me to stop. I was very sensitive so this was my fault but I felt unable to cry or she’d humiliate me. She did that a lot, whenever something embarrassing/unfortunate happened she’d tell her friends about it in front of me most of the time. At home, she’d pick up my pants from the washing and act like I’d soiled myself even when I knew she was lying and I hadn’t

She’d often grab my behind when I made it clear how uncomfortable I was, and made innuendos a lot as I was going through puberty. As a kid she’d often pull down her pants and wave her, uh, behind around because it was ‘funny’. She’d swear a lot and go drinking on Saturday’s quite often. 

The worst of it all would be her shouting. Ever since I was young and she was even mildly inconvenienced, she’d have a shouting fit that’d often divert into screaming, and sometimes she’d threaten divorce to my father. She shouts all the time and I can’t bear it. Even when not angry she’s still so loud and I wish I could block her out. I wish her shouting and negativity wasn’t so prevalent. She’s always complaining and there’s no reasoning with her when she does. One minute she’s dancing around like a child and the next she’s screaming over something

Despite all of this, I know it’s my fault. I’m a extremely socially-anxious shut-in with no friends, no talents and just no redeeming qualities. I can imagine how much she detests me for being the way I am and I am forever in her debt for it. She compares me to my high-achieving sister a lot and I can’t blame her at all. Whenever she gets angry at me she’ll often say ‘smile more’ but there’s nothing I can smile about. I’m so awful to her for not even being able to smile

I’m really sorry for this post. There’s nobody I can vent to so I’m sorry you have to see this.

g1avbt,[US-IL] Potential Renter wants Safe Space from Domestic Abuse,"I am subleasing rooms in a 2 bed 2 bathroom house I am renting. I am only subleasing until the end of summer. A woman and her friend were interested in the sublease. I video chatted with her and gave her a digital tour of the house. I noticed that she was in her vehicle and had two young children with her in the car. She was okay with the price of the rooms and I asked her if she would be occupying the room with her kids. She said yes and that her friend also has a child.

I messaged her the next day informing her that I am not prepared having three children in the house because of the noise level and that it would also be an issue when finding a third person to rent. She messaged me that she understands but is looking for safe place for herself and her children until she returns to her native country to her parents in the middle of June (Note that the lease will start on May 1st). She told me she is in an abusive relationship.

I am not prepared at all for what may come with housing a fleeing domestic abused victim. What resources are there that I can give to her so that she can find a safe place for herself, her children, and perhaps her friend as well?

g1b6v2,I need help out of a mental jail.,"Hi. I have absolutely no where to go to with this. I dont know what to do right now. 
I am female, in my mid 20s. I have had anxiety and panic attacks since my mother past away several years back. I have a gen x husband who a few months ago started bullying me. Verbally, mentally. 
Before I began this relationship he knew about my anxiety and comforted me and helped me through it. Most of it was very small momentary things. 
It seems as tho he has turned on me. It starts with an assumption he has about the way I'm feeling or I say something the wrong way. He can see me scrambling in my mind to figure out how I upset him and he yells at me. My anxiety starts and I start shaking but I'm still calm. I'm just sad that hes mad at me. And he starts yelling ""why the fuck are you shaking, why do you have to react like this"" .. and I just want comfort.  I just want him to love on me but he pulls away and yells at me more about times I've been self abusive a couple years ago and asking me very loudly if I'm going to do it again where his kids can hear him. 
This happens all the time. I'm so scared to have problems in the future because I cant go to him. But I love him so much I need to make this work and I need to make him happy.. I dont understand why he keeps me here with and then it's so easy for him to treat me like I'm horrible. 
everytime I try to talk to him about this he says I'm going about it the wrong way, or he doesnt like my tone, or that I'm harping on it. Or that I made him act this way.
I'm really sad. I have a baby with him and because of financial reasons and emotional ties, and cavoid stuff I can not leave him right now. I need to figure out how to stop being upset by it all.",Justafan93,2020-04-14 11:40:34,0,365,11.44,25.53,81.15,1,13.52,9.59,95.89,64.93,27.12,20.55,13.7,0,0.55,6.3,0,6.58,3.29,13.97,9.59,7.95,8.77,1.64,19.73,5.48,1.92,2.47,0,2.19,8.22,1.92,6.3,2.74,1.92,0.55,11.51,0.82,0,0.55,6.58,12.6,2.47,3.56,2.19,2.74,1.1,3.01,2.47,0.27,1.92,0.27,0.82,0,0,0.27,0,3.84,1.64,0.55,0.82,0,1.1,3.29,17.53,1.1,15.62,1.92,6.85,7.12,0.55,0,0,0.27,0,0,0.82,0.27,0.27,0.27,0,0,13.15,7.95,1.64,0,0,0,0,0,0.55,3.01,0,0
g1c3vr,how can childhood trauma affect your current relationships?,"Before I explain my question further, I'm just going to briefly tell my experience so skip to the last part if you don't want to read this. 

I experienced physical and verbal abuse from my nanny when I was 4/5 (I'm 18 now). Both of my parents work all day for me and my older siblings so they hired a nanny to take care of their youngest (me) while they work all day. She would hurt me every time I'm left alone with her at the house and when before my parents arrive she will remind me not to say a word or she will hurt me even more. Since I was so young my memory of it is kind of blurry but I can still remember her face and the way she made me feel. Imagine a skinny middle-aged lady with black hair and wide eyes. Now that I think of it, she's straight out of a horror film. I can still even feel her long and sharp nails digging to my skin. I don't know why she hated me, I thought maybe she thinks kids are annoying and being a nanny is her only way of making a living so she was exerting her frustrations at me. But then I remember that my brother who was 5 years older than me (making him 9/10 at that time) would sometimes be home with us too and she would be nice so nice to him and I would feel jealous and think that maybe something is wrong with me and that I'm just a bad child which she would always make me feel I am btw. Then I don't exactly remember what happened but my parents found out and she was immediately fired and the only thing I remember from that day is her flipping the middle at me when no one was looking before she left... kinda comedic ngl.


So I'm just wondering...

I'm an introverted, non confrontational and socially anxious person and I do have a few friends and I'm in the verge of losing all of them because I don't know how to maintain a relationship. I don't talk to them for days and days on purpose even though I know it's going to affect the relationship I've already established with them. I tend to distance myself a lot on people that I somehow already initiated I relationship with. It's like I don't allow myself to be too invested in a relationship even if I'm so lonely and seeks connection with someone. It's like I want intimacy but I'm also scared of it. 

I don't know I feel like I'm self-sabotaging myself and  I just wondered what if this had something to do with my childhood abuse...

I just want to know what you think? Maybe I'm wrong and I just really lack good social skills lmao but if you experienced abuse too and you're the same when it comes to relationships let me know...

g1drr3,The worst night of my life,"I need to find a way to express the anger and pain that pops up unexpectedly. I left my abusive husband in August 2019 and am still dealing with legal aspects of the divorce. In some ways I feel so free and in other ways I feel like nothing has changed at all. 

It was August 2018 and we had been married for 8 months. I finished work around 8 pm on a Friday night and we planned to travel to a city 2 hours away to spend the weekend. There was a casino in the city as well as a concert we planned to attend. 

The night started off well. I remember enjoying the drive, laughing and listening to music. We got to the city around 10 pm and learned that the shuttle to the casino was still open. I had worked all day (8 am to 8 pm) but wanted to check the place out so I changed into a nice dress and heels and we took the shuttle. 

At first, everything was great. We each took out $200. I lost my money but my husband somehow quadrupled his. I urged him to quit while he was ahead but by this time he had several drinks and wasn’t listening. Since it was his money (separate bank accounts), I didn’t force the issue. 

The night first started turning sour when we were at the bar. He noticed that I was acting quiet and asked me what was wrong. He never cared what was wrong, it was more of a warning. I let him know that nothing was wrong, I had been up for 18 hours at that point and was kind of tired but was enjoying the casino experience. 

We waited for a cab because the shuttle service had shut down. We got in the cab and I leaned against him and didn’t talk much because I was exhausted. He again asked me “what my problem” was. I started to get a little annoyed as I assured him I was just tired from the extremely long day. 

When we got back to the hotel, my husband was insistent on going and getting something to eat. It was very late and most places were closed. He was too intoxicated to drive so I begged him to stay with me and look for a late night pizza delivery place. He was already annoyed with me and not hearing it. I followed him to his car and got in the passenger seat. 

I can’t remember all the details except that he was drunk, wanted to eat, and convinced I was in a bad mood and spoiling the evening. We were smoking a joint and started arguing. He was screaming at me and jabbed me in the arm with a lighter. That was the first time he had ever touched me in an aggressive way. I was shocking and threw the joint at him. It fell between the seats which only made him angrier. He screamed at me and told me to go back to the hotel room. 

I walked through the empty hotel parking lot holding back tears. I was terrified and heartbroken. I told myself that I needed to leave, but I was in a city 2 hours away. This is not the first bad encounter I had with him, but the worst. I decided I would go back to the hotel room, grab my belongings, then go to the front desk and book a new hotel room. I decided I would call my father and confess how scared and unhappy I was. I knew he would come get me. 

I grabbed my things and headed to the elevator. When the elevator door slid open, my heart dropped. It was my husband. He said “what are you doing?” and I told him my plan. For a second I thought he would realize how hurt I was and apologized. Instead he looked at me and said “get back in the hotel room”. So I did. 

Once back inside, we went back and forward. Me crying and begging him to understand that I was just worried about him, that I was taken aback by him jabbing me with the lighter, to please forgive me. He wasn’t hearing it. He laid down and rolled over to go to sleep. 

I laid down next to him, crying, begging him to hold me and forgive me for upsetting him. He then started making sexual advances towards me. I turned him down, I was too upset. But he held me down, forced himself on me, and told me that’s what I deserved. He then rolled over and fell asleep. 

I got up and showered, sobbing. I got back in bed and slept restlessly for a couple hours. When I woke up, I had the worst migraine of my life. 

He took me out to breakfast and apologized for being so “mean” to me. I forgave him and stayed with him for another year.",Moon_Root_,2020-04-14 14:00:12,1,841,44.33,41.99,85.95,2.21,12.94,14.51,93.58,60.17,21.05,17.24,10.46,1.43,0.12,5.23,0,3.8,6.66,13.32,7.61,4.76,8.32,1.19,19.14,4.16,1.43,1.43,2.02,1.43,6.18,1.66,4.4,0.71,0.83,1.07,10.34,0.83,0,0,5.83,8.92,2.38,1.31,1.07,0.71,1.19,2.26,2.73,0.24,1.43,0.83,2.85,0.71,0.95,0.12,1.07,8.92,2.14,1.66,2.14,1.9,1.19,13.08,4.16,0.71,18.67,3.33,9.63,7.13,0.95,2.14,0.83,1.31,0.12,0,0.24,0,0,0,0.24,0,12.6,7.49,2.73,0,0,0.12,0,0,0.95,0.71,0.48,0.12

g1itu4,What would you do,"Im not sure what I should do or what’s happening I’m so confused. I’m diagnosed as autistic so I’m prone to having meltdowns and stuff and people often take advantage of me for it, including my family. Basically since a very young age my parents would hit me, but like properly hit me, they’d drag me of the top bunk of my bed, I was hit on the head with a bell and many other things. I tried to tell someone as I was late for school because of it when I was around 10 and the social work got involved, my parents were so angry and they shut me up and it was turned on me for being autistic and I had to stay quiet and lie. As I grew older, I started hitting back, my family would often close in on me so I locked myself in a kitchen and they screamed so I got scared and poked a knife through to scare them off (I had no intent of hurting them I had to keep them away) I was around 11 or 12. My family still continued to hit and I’d hit back but eventually we stopped but I still felt terrible as if I was being manipulated. When I was 17 my dad punched me so I stayed at a relatives house and not long later I fought with my sister and slapped her, she was 14. And I slapped my mum once as well. There was one occurrence where my mum threw a glass plate at me so I attacked her back, she called the police and said I attacked first but no charges have been held at all any of these times. I’ve tried to call the police many times when they’ve hit me, when I was young, they’d drag me down the stairs and humiliated me as they ripped my shirt while fighting when I was 13. Every time they’d take my phone away, lock the door and I’d be kept inside. We don’t fight physically ever now but I think they emotionally abuse me. I’m constantly put down by them, they don’t want me to work and anytime I have a hobby they get mad. They don’t want me seeing friends and often tell me my friends don’t like me. I get criticised for everything. My siblings hit me sometimes, they are all 15+ and I am now 20 but they don’t bother and say I deserve it for ruining their childhoods and blaming my autism. I had a girlfriend (I’m also a girl) so my mum and sister found her social media to insult her and got me to break up with her. They do this with friends as well and aren’t accepting of me dating a girl. It’s resorted to me sleeping during the day and awake all night as I’m afraid of being awake at the same time and don’t want to see them incase I get in trouble, I feel like I can’t do anything right. I’m thinking of running away. I have nightmares of them hitting me all those years and the things they said to me. I told them and they told me it was my own fault and I shouldn’t have hit back, but I was a small child against adults, including a 50 year old man. Please tell me if I’m overreacting or what I should do. I told my old psychiatrist and my mum came all the time and the psychiatrist concluded I was the scapegoat of the family, which I got into so much trouble for.",azminkookie,2020-04-14 18:58:48,1,608,9.5,23.96,96.3,1.72,24.32,11.68,92.27,63.49,25,21.55,15.95,0.33,0.16,1.15,3.95,3.45,4.28,12.01,11.02,6.09,11.35,2.14,20.23,3.78,2.3,1.81,1.97,1.64,5.26,1.15,4.11,0.82,2.14,0.33,13.49,2.47,0.66,2.47,0.33,9.38,1.32,0.66,1.81,2.3,1.48,2.96,1.81,0.33,0.99,0.49,0.99,0.49,0.33,0,0.16,8.55,3.12,1.15,2.3,1.64,0.66,7.4,8.72,0.16,14.47,1.32,6.09,7.89,0.82,0.99,1.32,0,0,0,0.33,0,0,0,0.33,0,12.17,3.95,2.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.44,0.66,0.16

g1krcf,I’m worried about what I might do,"To start this off, I’d like to inform you all that I am a victim of sexual abuse by my cousin back when I was younger (6 or 7). I don’t remember it very well, but it was enough that my brain doesn’t exactly let me relax around distant relatives. I only meet with my relatives once or twice a year, but I feel like I’m constantly on edge around them. Not really impactful, but it’s just another factor to my situation.

Now, I’m not trying to sound edgy or deep. That’s really the only major concern I have about this post. So please...don’t mock me for sounding like I’m Billie Elise’s clone.

My siblings make my home life hell. My older sister yells at me for being loud while she chats away to her boyfriend (who I am 90% is on drugs whenever we met) all day. She stays up till around midnight just playing games with him (still talking, mind you), keeping me up. Then, at around 9 in the morning, she’ll forcibly wake me by turning the lights on and loudly slamming the wardrobe doors in our room (my mom and stepdad bought a small condo for us to live in. Nobody sleeps in a room alone). Once, when I was going back onto my bed, she looked me dead in the eyes and said something. I didn’t hear her, so I asked her to repeat it on instinct. Turns out, she wasn’t talking to me, but to her boyfriend, something I only discovered when she flipped me off and threw a fork at me. Fun.

My older brother (younger than my sister by 2 years) is the human form of the stereotypical bully. He’s jacked to hell (how? don’t know. I’ve personally never seen him work out), and uses his height to basically push me around. As I sleep in a small room with a sister who treats me like the embodiment of human garbage (and still thinks I’m the asshole for shaking the bed from crying, true story), so I’ll sneak out from our room and stay in the living room to try and just be alone. Problem is, that’s the area my brother decided was his man cave. If I don’t hide or leave when he comes in, he’ll pick me up by my shirt collar and literally throw me out of the room into the hallway. I’m a scrawny video game obsessed anime lover. That’s a fight that’s not going to happen.

My little brother (who, as of writing this, has announced that I’m dead to him and that he’d never talk to me again. One down, two to go) could arguably be called the worst out of the three. Not only does he physically attack me (once I was siting quietly in the dark in my parents room and he came in and began to choke me), but he’s also sexually assaulted me many times. With the history between myself and my cousin, it’s sort of like adding gasoline to the fire I was just about to put out. He tried to get what remains of my friend group to ditch me after he got rid of the rest by spreading rumors about me assaulting 𝘩𝘪𝘮, but luckily, the three of my remaining allies figured him out and ignored him. It’s been about 5 years since I met them: that’s the longest I’ve ever been able to hold a friendship. I’ve wanted to sink to his level for so long, but I just don’t see the point anymore. I won’t have to deal with him one day, right?

My parents, bless their souls, just don’t seem to understand the problem. My mother was adopted in the 1970s, and while her step siblings definitely didn’t like her, she made it to her 18th birthday relatively intact. My stepfather grew up as a farmhand. He never had to see his siblings if he didn’t want to.

As much as I despise the United States school systems, I’m the only member of my family attending the high school I’m going to. One of my three remaining friends is also going there. I can take up as much space as I want to there but now, with the virus shutting down schools, that safe space is gone too. I probably sound entitled, since I can still get food because my parents are lawyers and animators. 

12:00 P.M is the start of what I call my relax zone. From that point until my parents wake up in the morning, I can move around my house without feeling like I’m in someone’s way or annoying someone. I can eat what I want without being called a pig. It’s the only period of time when I feel like I live in the place I call my home.
It’s never as long as I’d like to be, thought.

I’ve had dreams about killing myself lately. I know they’re wrong. I know I’d be missed. But there’s a part of my mind that says 
‘By who? The three people who have lives outside of you? The people that you’re not even too sure actually care about you? The majority of your family thinks you’re a waste of space, what if the rest of it thinks you are too? Don’t you want to avoid conflict? Wouldn’t it be easier to just get it over with? What even is death, anyway? Just finding out what’s on the other side of that door, right?’

I know I’m going to Hell for the lies that I’ve told (I’ve been diagnosed as a pathological liar, which might stem from my need of avoiding people), and at this point I’m not too sure I won’t take myself there. 

I’m really sorry if this sounds edgy or something, but it feels good to talk about it.

g1v1us,I need some help figuring out what happened to me,"I realised recently that I've been dismissing what's actually a very traumatic memory. I didn't repress it as such, because it always kept popping back up, but I never let myself think on it because it was too embarrassing and painful and I didn't think there was any point dwelling. But now I'm realising it had a serious impact on me and I've never told anyone.

(TW for CSA(??? I don't know if it even counts)

It was when I was about 13/14, and I had a very minor medical concern- I don't want to go into detail but it was completely non-threatening and something I'd dealt with fine before. I made the mistake of telling my mother, who has been prone to bouts of sudden mania my whole life. She gets hyperfixated on tiny problems and won't let them go, and gets increasingly aggressive and stubborn the more you try to get her to drop it. She had hit me hard several times before, chased me up the stairs- I was scared of her, and scared of making her angry. She wasn't a monster or abusive 24/7 but she was very difficult to live with.

Anyway, the medical thing was on my anus. I hate talking about this because it sounds so stupid, and also sounds like it could have been perfectly reasonable for her to be concerned, but please trust me when I say there's no way it could have been potentially serious. It was a very minor thing and nothing a doctor would ever have asked to look at.

She started telling me she needed to see, to check I was right. I told her no, I'm not stupid and I know what it is, it can't be anything else (I really didn't want to go into detail with her about that part of my body). She gave me this look like I was being silly and kept saying she had to look and told me not to be difficult. I started crying and shouting at her that I wouldn't do it. I was really scared and confused at her reaction because I didn't expect things to go this way. She started getting angry and wouldn't let me leave (I don't think she physically stopped me though. I don't know why I stayed but I remember just being so scared of her).

I was sobbing the whole time and begging her not to make me, but eventually I relented and she told me to bend over and show her. I was so embarrassed and couldn't stop crying. She confirmed what I said was accurate and acted like now it was over, there was no reason for me to be upset. 

After it happened I seemed to realise the gravity of what I was feeling and screamed at her that she was a pedophile and I hated her. I went to my room and cried, and she told me through the door that she really didn't take any pleasure doing it, and I do believe that that's true. She's never done anything like that before or since, and I genuinely think this was just another bout of her mania. But it really fucked me up.

What does this even count as? I looked up sexual abuse but it doesn't seem to fit, because I don't think it was sexually motivated. But I want to be able to put a label on what happened to me. I want to understand what this was.

g1v35o,Is there any hope for a chronic emotional abuser?,"My fiance is Bipolar 2. During her episodes of mania she becomes horribly emotionally abusive. She then does the classic abuser thing and blames her getting mad on me.

She had a bad episode two days ago and blamed me for her anger when I told her a tire was flat on a bike we were looking at Walmart. She said she didn't care, rode it anyway, even after I said it might damage it. ""I'm an adult I can do what I want"". Then threw a massive fit. It kept escalating and she threatened to make me ""cry like a little bitch"" with embarrassment if I got onto her like that in public again. She started smoking in the house, and wouldn't stop when asked nicely. Blamed me for ruining her daughters birthday party that day. She told her daughter that the only way she can get out of this relationship was to get into another one and she could do that in a few days, essentially telling her that she's going to whore herself out. It dawned on me during part of this what it was, an episode of mania.

She walked out and then texted me that some guy picked her up and she was going stay over there. I told her that she was crossing a line that you can't easily come back from. She then said she was ""forced to come back"" because I was threatening her and her stuff. I then just tried to lock myself in my office the get away from the abuse. She got more violent and started beating on the door, throwing stuff at it. I called the police, and while on the phone she kept throwing stuff at the door.

They came, and by that time she had locked herself in our room. They said they can't really do anything, unless she's being actively violent to another person. They tried to talk to her but she didn't respond to knocks on the bedroom door so they left.

Eventually we were able to get my stepdaughter picked up by a friend, thank god. And eventually still (after a call to the cops), she stayed in our room and calmed down. Came down from it, and then needed my help with nursing a migraine away.

When confronted the next day she blamed the day on me. She blamed her anger on me. That started another massive episode.

She started smoking inside again and flicking cigarette butts at me and my desk. Then as the day got worse she told more and more complete lies like how I tried to force her to have a threesome with some old guy, or how I sexually abuse her, how I broke her arm, or put sugar in her gas tank (she doesn't even have a car right now). She tried to beat down my office door with a hammer. She took most of my clothes, put them in the trash barrel, then emptied the litter box onto them. Her dog got out for a bit and she blamed me so started throwing cats out the door. It just kept getting worse and worse... The cops refused to do anything, I guess if you wanna commit minor crime right now is the time to do it because they aren't even serving bench warrants for misdemeanors.

Luckily my therapist is a freaking saint and was with me through most of this over the phone.

I eventually was able to get in touch with her best friend and he showed up and got her to leave with her. She finally crashed at his place, and got some meds in her, and calmed the fuck down.

She apologized to me over the phone, but still wanted to say it was ""50/50"" on the fault scale. I had to remind her several times that she was the one who kept following me and not leaving me alone, not the other way around. This time, she listened and accepted the fact that she had done that.

Now, I know that manic her isn't really her... but even when she's not manic she rarely accepts responsibility for wrongs she's done to others. I worry when we go to unpack all this she's going to want to blame me for even part of this.

***I*** am not to blame for her anger issues. If she can't even be honest with herself and me about that, then any conversation we have about continuing is going to end right there.

Do you guys think there is any hope of recovery for this person? Mania aside the narcissism is pretty egregious sometimes.

It's not like this most of the time, but even 5% of the time of ***that level of mania*** is too much. I don't want to leave someone because of a health issue, that seems cruel... but if she doesn't choose to get help and treatment for it then I'm not going through yesterday again.

g1wkua,Was it abuse? If anyone could give any input at all I'd be really grateful.,"It's been a year and I still can't move on, and I can't get therapy now, so I might as well vent here. I need a second opinion, because I don't know if I actually was abused or not. If you read this, thank you.

I had to be her therapist. Every problem was my fault because I couldn't fix it, and she *expected* be me to fix it. She told me she self harmed, had suicidal thoughts, had anorexia and bullemia, and was FtM trans and her mother hated her (she wasn't trans, as it turns out), and faked panic attacks (looking back, they clearly weren't). Every day at school I'd beg her to eat and she wouldn't. I tried to tell her she needed to talk to someone, but she always said that she couldn't and it would ruin her life. I had to carry all of that worry and stress. Every day if she was late to school I'd make myself sick thinking she'd killed herself and it was my fault for not being able to fix all of her problems.

And it made my own problems worse. I was so stressed every day I started to self harm and throw up meals, and my own suicidal thoughts increased tenfold. Whether or not she was eating was MY problem to try to fix, and I wasn't being a good enough girlfriend, and I kept on telling her and telling her to get professional help but every time she refused. She used threats of suicide, self harm and bullemia against me. ""I might have to do something later"" was a favourite saying of hers, and I knew what it meant.

Over the summer, she told me that the only times she ate were when I visited. I visited so that she would eat. The first time visiting she made out with me on her bed. She convinced me that it made her feel so much better, and on the second visit: I'm a completely pathetic pushover, and she knew I didn't know how to say 'no,' I *still* don't, so I let her finger me and I just felt...nothing. She got really upset over that and started guilting me for not living up to her lesbian porn fantasy, and body shaming me for not shaving and having my period start one minute after she fingered me. I felt awful so she started to make everything about how she was having a panic attack (she clearly wasn't) and how SHE felt awful even though she was the one initiating everything.

I felt violated. I still feel disgusting about it. I shouldn't have let her, but I did. There was always the implication that if I didn't she'd hurt herself.

At prom I had a breakdown. I was crying in front of everyone and I never wanted to kill myself more than in that moment. It was the result of all the stress she caused me worrying about her mental health and of course the disgust and regret I felt about her touching me. Again, she made it my fault. She said I ruined prom, and broke up with me. I do agree with her that I ruined prom.

Since then I have to see her every day at sixth form and be reminded of it. It got so bad the first few days at sixth form I was convinced everyone was plotting to make me kill myself, and that she and another girl who treated me cruelly were pulling the strings. Quarantine should be a relief since I no longer have to see her, but I still can't move on from all the hurt and resentment.

Honestly, I think the eating disorder was a lie. She never lost any weight. And being trans was a lie too. She never wanted me to use her preferred male name or pronouns. During her ""panic attacks"" she never showed any signs of, well, panic. She singled me out and manipulated me because I was vulnerable and socially inept and a complete pushover. It was common knowledge that I was practically mute most of the time at school. I hate myself so much for what I let her do.

Thank you for reading. Was it emotional abuse? I know it's no where near as bad as what most people go through, but I can't move on no matter what I try and it just hurts.",goslet,2020-04-15 10:33:25,6,758,7.59,29.87,28.98,1,16.13,13.32,94.72,62.53,24.8,19,10.55,0,0.4,7.92,0.13,5.8,3.3,10.42,10.29,5.94,9.76,3.96,21.37,3.03,1.72,1.45,1.06,2.77,8.84,1.58,7.26,1.58,1.85,1.45,13.46,0.13,0.13,8.31,0.13,17.94,2.77,2.9,3.17,2.9,3.43,4.62,2.9,0.53,0.53,1.85,2.51,0.4,0.92,0.26,1.06,5.41,0.4,1.19,1.98,0.79,1.45,9.63,7.65,0.53,10.82,1.72,3.56,5.54,0.79,0.53,0.13,0,0,0.79,0.4,0,0,0.13,0.26,0,16.23,6.33,4.22,0.13,0,0.26,0,0,0.53,3.43,0.79,0.53

g1yelb,Hazy memory of inappropriate touch.,"A memory from when I must’ve been 4 or 5 years of age came crashing down upon me today. I remember playing with a neighbour’s kid at that age. He was two years older to me and would touch me at my private parts whenever we were alone. I don’t remember how far he went. I do remember him seeing and touching my bare genitals. The part that disturbs me the most is that I don’t remember struggling or stopping him even though I can’t imagine how I could’ve possibly wanted it. 
The thought makes my stomach revolt now. It makes me lose my mind to think I could’ve been okay with it. But, the memory is too hazy for me to properly conclude anything.

g1z68b,This quarantine is triggering all my issues and I don’t know if my relationship will survive,"This quarantine is triggering all my issues and I don’t know if my relationship will survive

My trauma is mostly based on sexual abuse in my first relationship. My second relationship didn’t help either as it was abusive from both sides, mostly because of drug abuse.

I’ve gone to EMDR treatment recently (after 6 years of avoiding to deal with my trauma), and everything improved rather quickly. 

But it seems like the quarantine really triggers different aspects of my trauma.

Both relationships really trapped me. During the first one I was manipulated to break contact with my friends and spend all my time with this guy. During my second, we trapped ourselves because of this drug abuse. (He’s also locked me in his room, but that’s another story). 
I dealt with this by spending a lot (like an excessive amount) of time with my friends since then. I also keep my schedule way too busy so I never feel as lazy and useless as during that time.
I can’t say these are the most healthy coping mechanisms, but they helped me get through the days.

I’m in a fairly new relationship at the moment, we have officially been together for a few months now. We have actually been seeing each other for a year and half now, but I wasn’t ready for an official relationship at the time.

I’m having so many doubts now. Because of the restrictions we don’t have much to do. We don’t see each other that often, like once a week, twice at most. But I can’t seem to have fun with him. He’s also not the most active person ever, so we ended kinda hanging around the house. 

To be honest, I’m not the easiest person to deal with right now. I keep pushing him away because that’s what feels safe. This passiveness during this time really reminds me of all the negative parts of my previous relationships and I can’t seem to connect with him right now.

It’s just not fun to be around him because these fears are so overwhelming, which leads to us not having a good time together, which leads to more fear on my behalf because I think I’m fucking up our relationship. It’s stupid, but that’s how it is.

I have told him all this, but he also doesn’t really know how to deal with it.

I don’t know if anyone is going to read this rant, but thank you if you have! I just needed to write it all down I guess.",Anenlou,2020-04-15 12:42:58,1,440,20.47,21.31,93.3,11.17,16.3,14.32,94.32,61.14,21.14,14.09,9.32,2.05,0.45,2.05,0.23,7.05,4.32,14.09,10,7.05,8.86,3.86,16.82,5.23,3.41,1.14,2.05,4.77,6.14,2.5,3.64,1.14,1.36,0.45,10,0,0.91,0,2.27,17.95,2.27,3.64,1.36,4.32,2.05,7.05,1.14,0.45,0.23,0.45,0.91,0,0.45,0.45,0,9.77,5.23,1.82,2.27,0.45,0.68,2.73,13.86,0.91,14.77,1.36,5,8.41,1.36,0.68,0.45,0.45,0,0,0.45,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,16.14,5.68,3.64,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,5.23,1.36,0
g1zeqf,"How can I get my husband (52M) to understand that one (me, 62F) does not feel talkative and lovey-dovey after being verbally abused?","When drinking, my husband has a tendency to get extremely verbally abusive - as in extreme overreaction - to relatively minor things. He will go on &amp; on &amp; on, following me around the house and raging - yelling, calling me names and mocking me.

Last night, for example I went to bed fairly early. He stayed up watching TV and drinking more, then came to bed. When he's in this state he has no concept of personal space, sliding way over to my side of the bed and trapping me at the edge. He has a very warm body and tends to throw his leg over me, which adds to the discomfort. I try gently waking him and asking him to move over a little; sometimes it works but usually he'll say, ""I am!"" and then stay right where he is. Last night I tried pushing him over with my arms &amp; feet and he went BALLISTIC. ""WHAT THE F\*\*\* IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU TRYING TO KICK ME OUT OF BED, YOU F\*\*\*\*\*G R\*\*\*\*D (unacceptable phrase for mentally deficient person)?"" And so on. I said, ""I'm not doing this"" and went into the living room.

Of COURSE he followed me, yelling, raging, calling me twit, r\*\*\*\*d, bi!ch, insane, everything under the sun. Interrogating me with the same questions over &amp; over: ""What did you do? How did you do it?"" - trying to get me to say that I KICKED him when I simply tried to push him over a little. He went on &amp; on for hours...it was insane. I try not to engage but it's impossible as he won't let up until I say what he wants me to say (which I don't do). It was very important to him that I ""admit"" that I kicked him, but I refused because I DIDN'T! I call this Evil Tom. Many times he doesn't even remember doing it, so I recorded him with my phone and played it the morning after a particularly awful night. He was flabbergasted, apologetic and very ashamed of himself. He promised to change his behavior but that hasn't happened. He has said he hates being recorded, but there is literally no other way to make him understand how he gets! (Oh, a relative staying here for a wedding actually heard him speaking rudely to me one morning after a night of drinking and chided him for it. He is repentant when I remind him but it doesn't last long.)

The worst part of this is, *he thinks his behavior is justified* because ""I kicked him out of bed."" He tried to pour himself ANOTHER drink - it's now like 2 or 3 a.m. - and I poured it out. HOO-BOY, cardinal sin! At that point he actually had the nerve to say that I ""drove him to it."" He refuses to take **ANY** responsibility for his behavior, blaming ME for ""causing him to have reactions."" And this morning I'm supposed to be all happy and cheerful again, as if I hadn't just been reamed a new one by Evil Tom. No, I'm just ""dwelling"" on it and WHY CAN'T I JUST GET OVER IT!""

TL;dr: My husband horribly abuses me when he drinks too much, makes his behavior my fault, and expects me to be fine in the morning.",relationthrow041520,2020-04-15 12:55:32,1,582,29.42,54.78,47.46,3.22,15.73,14.78,91.75,59.45,23.02,17.01,8.42,0,0.86,7.73,0,6.01,3.78,14.09,7.73,5.5,7.73,2.41,18.73,4.3,1.72,2.58,0.86,1.37,5.67,1.55,3.95,0.69,1.89,0,14.09,0.69,0,0,8.59,9.28,1.55,2.06,0.69,2.06,0.86,2.92,2.75,0.17,2.06,0.34,2.23,0.86,0.34,0.17,0.86,7.04,0.69,1.37,3.26,1.2,0.52,5.15,10.48,1.2,16.15,3.78,7.39,5.33,0.52,1.2,1.2,0,0.17,0,0.52,0,0.34,0,0.17,0,30.24,5.33,5.15,0.34,1.2,0.86,1.03,1.37,3.26,2.58,1.72,7.39
g20isx,returning home because of coronavirus," 

I've just found this subreddit and after reading people's posts I would like to share my current situation.

I have a narcissistic father but I didn't recognise him as such until I left for University. I met people there who helped me realise that my childhood was not normal and that I had been emotionally abused my whole life. I began to realise that my whole perception of myself as overdramatic, a drama queen and lazy were because of this. I also began to realise that my need to be the best at everything and to work really hard academically, as well as my perception of things I could never do, were all based off my father's abuse and bullying. It was an insane experience to realise all these things.

I think that having spent my entire life feeling tense, never knowing when I would be told off or declared lazy etc, I could never really relax. At university I was happy at first, then I spiralled into a deep depression. The things that had taken no effort before suddenly were impossible and I also began to overeat and gain weight - again because food was a very tense topic at home. I feel a lot of shame for not achieving as much as I'd like to.

I dreaded holidays and managed to find friends to stay with or tough out a few weeks not seeing a single soul rather than going home. Whenever I did go home though I'd find myself in intense periods of self-improvement - i'd suddenly start working overtime, over-exercising and dieting. Most of the time I wouldn't even realise why until I was deep into a perfectionist spiral - it was because I was back home.

I also began to suffer from dreams (this happened also to a lesser degree before I left home) that picture myself and my mother and sisters either being imprisoned or sexually abused by my father. He has never sexually abused me but I have grown a strange fear that he will, even though there have been no indicators. I think it has something to do with the weigh he so coldly weighs up my appearance/body/weight - perhaps I connect objectification and sexualisation.

As the only member of my family ( i have two sisters and a mother who live at home with him ) who is vocal about this I have had some struggles. I've realised that the only reason I persistently recognise and call out the abuse is because I have some traits that are similar to him - I am good at debating, I am stubborn etc. I am worried that this means I am going to turn into him. I have promised myself that I will never have children or get married in case I become like him without knowing. I have a fear of childbirth and I am constantly paranoid about being pregnant and I wonder if this is linked.

Things at home have taken a strange turn since I had to move back due to coronavirus. I've not been allowing myself to think of how long this may last as I think I would struggle to cope. The other day there was an awful confrontation - my father was trying to get my mother, my sisters and I to move a wardrobe up a spiral staircase and into a doorway that it would never fit into. All of us suffer from back problems and other injuries. It was something he wanted to do on a whim and was just generally illogical. I stood up for myself and them, I was shaking but I did it and finally finally my sisters and mother stuck with me. It ws so strange though because afterwards I felt ashamed - like the only way i could defeat him was to become him.

My mother straight out told me that she would never leave him because she didn't want to lose the monetary benefits of being with him. I adore her so I would never tell anyone that but I guess this is anonymous so it doesn't matter if i say it - she is being weak and selfish by doing nothing. I still love her though and I understand the temptation to give in to fear.

My sisters also do not stand up to him. They recently privately said to me that they wished they were 'determined' like me and thought I was right. I am sure that sounds like I am making it up or trying to make myself look good but I'm just trying to explain the situation properly. They are always silent when I stand up for myself or them.

My older sister and I have both got major issues with anxiety, depression and body dismorphia due to our childhood. My younger sister will probably develop them in time.

Writing this I feel a little numb but it felt important to tell someone that nothing will change and this is the situation. Sometimes I feel proud for how I am acting, sometimes deeply ashamed. Sometimes I still convince myself that I have made it all up.

g22qfk,I Need Help with a Maybe Abusive Situation,"This happened a couple minutes ago, because I'm really confused on what to do. My father came into my room and saw I was napping, He woke me up and threatened to attack me if I didn't get out of bed and give him the keys to my pickup truck. I did it and he didn't attack me, I can tell he meant it. He did the same thing this morning telling me to get up out of bed or he'd attack, and the morning before that too. Earlier this week he had told my brothers to stop eating lunch, for no reason. He had also thrown away their favorite toys, because ""They were distracting him"" even though they kept them in their rooms, far away from him. Earlier this year he kicked me out over disagreements about going to a store, on the exact date he wanted me to, and before that, he had verbally belittled me for a week on end around Christmas 2019, calling me stupid and a million names, for wanting to buy a used car that I had my eye on. They year before when I was playing my playstation and the internet slowed down, he choked me against the stairs for using the internet. The incidents happen so far and few between, to the point where I cant tell if its abuse or one off incidents. It's at the point where I try my hardest to avoid him, but he keeps dragging back into his ring to do some kind of chore, or something, and then yells at me when it isn't done the exact way that he wants. My Mom says it happens because I do things to stress him out and get angry at me. Ive been involved in a couple of car accidents, where they were my fault, but I have been offering and see it as fair to pay for my insurance, as I have a job. He refuses to let me do that, then yells at me for costing him the money. He pressures me constantly to get a new job and texts my boss nasty things and says that I told my dad those things about my boss. I love my job and my boss, when were at work we have a healthy relationship and work well together, Its only strained by he rude things my dad sends him, and whenever it happens, Im always called in to explain a text that I've never seen before.

g234yt,Planning my escape,"My boyfriend who I have lived together with for 6 months is getting more and more scary to live with.. i told a few friends about it the past 2 weeks and all of them are very worried and want me to leave. I still love my boyfriend and want to see the best in him. I dont want to leave but i dont want to feel wrong in every aspect of my life. I think k my boyfriend is manipulative, with or without realizing it. He has anger issues and covid 19 stress is making him scarier and scarier. He recently is calling me terrible names and threatening to break the things he bought for me. I told my mom I want to move back home (I live across the country) after covid and she agreed to help me come home. I know where to contact the womens shelter if he gets physical but how do i go about slowly packing my things without tipping him off? He has suggested last night that I go home but I feel as though he meant it to make me sad as it has in the past when he threatens to leave me or send me home. I dont have any money but I dont share a bank account with him. My mother can send me some money if absolutely needed, and she also said if I need out sooner she will make it happen.

g23asg,for anybody that knows anything about DID... i desperately need help.,"[TW: rant/vent, emotional ab-se, mentions of s-icide, cheating(?), mention of a hospital visit]

this is a long sorry so i’ll just start from the very beginning.
a while back, i met somebody who i’ll call J. i started dating J, and they dropped the ‘i love you’ only a few days into it, and proposed only a few months into it. the idea of marriage even started off as wanting to move me to their home to get me out of my home life, and to get me better medical treatment. all of these are things i’ve come to know should’ve been warning signs, even though i went along with all of it.
it was known that both me and J were part of a system, and were the hosts of our respective systems at this point.
then... a very hidden alter within J’s system showed up and started fronting. i’ll call him K.
before all of this... i’d known that i was polyamorous. and... with the knowledge and consent of J, i started seeing K as well. K... also proposed, and i said yes. though... this time it felt like it was in a more timely manner.
J... had a lot of issues with jealousy, but i made sure to ask him if things were okay, and even said that if anything made either of the two uncomfortable that it would be stopped, numerous times.
eventually... J seemed like they were okay. they were saying things such as they wanted everything to work out between all of us, that seeing me and K together made them happy, said they were happy in response to me talking about K. i was still worried from this point on, so i still kept trying to make sure. but i trusted that J was telling me the truth.
then... J met somebody i’ll call S. i was told immediately that S was aromantic and that i didn’t have to worry about her wanting anything, ‘just in case i was worried’. even asked if they were wrong about saying that, and i honestly said that i was, a little bit.
a few more months went by, and J asked if they could be ‘official in some way’ with S. they had trouble explaining exactly what they wanted, even going as far as to saying the two of them thought about bringing up the possibility of intimacy, which... i’d known beforehand that J considered that to be the ‘highest form of expressing love’. yet... J also said there was nothing romantic wanted at all.
i felt... very betrayed, cheated on almost. the two things that get me, are i was never told S discovered that she was wrong about her orientation, and that J was seeking out a new relationship behind my back without asking my boundaries on the matter. so i honestly said no when J asked if i’d be comfortable, as they gave me the option to, saying it was okay.
i honestly wanted to leave J that day though, but i didn’t for a multitude of reasons that i’m only just now coming to realize that i should’ve seen as red flags. things such as... J begging me to stay, to not leave very early on in the relationship. those turned into promises to not leave. but i think maybe the biggest red flags of them all, were J saying things such as ‘i can’t live without you’, ‘i never want to be without you’, and another alter saying that if J ever lost me, they’d attempt to k-ll the body. and so against my better judgment, i stayed. my mental health started to decline at this point. i was... distrustful, but trying to heal on my own.
i was told J might want some space for a while, and so i gave them space.
as i was trying to give them space... they became convinced i favored K more, loved him more, which i didn’t. i was spending more time with K in an attempt to give J space. i kept trying to say this, but i kept being accused of favoring K. i started thinking that maybe i should’ve just said yes to J being with S, so they’d be happy, and i wouldn’t be going through this. i thought like this when J asked as well, that i should just say yes to keep them happy. but... with this, it felt like me and J started drifting apart.
eventually, J broke up with me by saying seeing the relationship between me and K hurt. i was... deeply confused by this, as they said in the past that it made them happy. i was completely devastated, and hurt, and just... confused. following this... K became the host of the system instead of J.
i started to build myself back up again, with K supporting me. i felt i was getting better. and then it came to light that K was hiding the fact that about a month after J broke up with me... they began seeing S. by the time this was said... they’d been together for about a month.
i was, again, very hurt. i was finally over everything, even talking about my future with K, when i found out that nobody planned to let me know anything, let alone seeing if i was okay.
the thing about J... they way they asked to be with S, and the way they left... it was pushing on some of my past trauma. an alter of mine that split because of said past trauma... was dormant until the first time i started feeling bad about the situation. it confused the hell out of me.
this brings us to now... i’m... very uncomfortable with this, and there’s been... i think 2 or 3 conversations about this now that have gone nowhere.
S is still very caught up on me saying no to J dating her at the same time as me, something i had every right to say no to, has called me manipulative and said i remind her of an abusive ex... almost right off the bat. she’s said things such as... ‘you didn’t even let me try’, ‘won’t you at least try to work with us’, and ‘you should’ve been okay by now’. i feel like i’m being guilted for saying no to something i had every right to say no to, and pressured into being okay with this.
J... has been going along with it. saying things like they have an obligation to S.
J’s even said i was obsessed with K, and even said i admitted to fanboying over K, which... i was sure i hadn’t, so i looked up the conversation, and sure enough, i hadn’t. i asked J if the relationship between me and K hurt... why didn’t they say anything, and... apparently it was because i was always gushing about K and deliberately reminding J that K was better in every way, that i loved K more. and... i really wasn’t. i was talking to J about K because they said it made them happy to hear me talk about the things that twisted my heart so much that i had to gush over them. K... did twist my heart that much. but at the same time... J was also twisting my heart just as much. i would talk to K about J all the time.
J... blamed not being able to speak up or be completely honest on me, and i’m incredibly hurt by that.
S... has said the situation between me and K is to blame for our current situation. that me being in a relationship with K that was apparently hurting J was the direct cause of the current situation, basically that this has been my fault.
my mental health is so low... that i’ve admitted to K about having s-icidal thoughts. S somehow heard about this, and twisted it around and said i said that i was going to k-ll myself if K left. i was asking myself if i really did, and looked it up, even though i know what i said... it came out in a bad way due to the conversation me and K were having at the time i’ll admit, but... i never meant it like that. i’d been feeling this way since before any of this happened.
i keep questioning if i really AM manipulative and abusive, if maybe i should just say i am and force myself to be okay with this. or just... walk away. i’m in such a low state that... either option is self destructive for me. i don’t want to walk away from K, and i don’t want to keep people from being happy, so i feel like i have to choose a self destructive option.
J and S have tried saying that i was using leaving K as a guilt trip but... that would mean they get to be happy. i... don’t see how me telling K that’s on the table as an option is guilt tripping J or S if they’re getting what they want either way.
K has said this situation has traumatized me and... i tried fighting back against that, saying i didn’t want to say that in fear of hurting people or it being manipulative to say that.
i... eventually got the courage to say that the situation has started to give me bad trauma episodes, and S spat back that ‘well asking this of me is putting me in one!’ and i’m just... so confused, and lost. i don’t know what to do. i never even explicitly asked her to do anything.
i’ve considered talking to K about me possibly saying this situation is ab-sive but... i don’t know... i’m so afraid of that’s just hurting people or making me a bad person, even though i’ve had multiple people support me in saying it. i’ve... even went to the hospital for chest pains, caved, and told the staff about this, and they started to talk to me about how some of the physical symptoms i’m experiencing can be caused by the stress of emotional ab-se, that... it could be used to prove the damage if i take it to court but... i knew this already, i looked it up, and denied it was happening to me, that i was just having panic attacks, but... when the staff told me... that’s when i really started thinking.
i’m still... absolutely terrified of calling this situation ab-sive, that it’ll make me manipulative and ab-sive. i’ve even started to wonder if i’d said yes to J and S dating all those months ago, if all my pain right now could’ve been avoided.
just... is it really manipulative and ab-sive of me to not be comfortable with this? to... not be completely okay with K’s alters dating other people? i’d known i wouldn’t be before, i’m not even comfortable with my OWN alters dating other people, but... am i wrong to be this hurt and this uncomfortable?
i’ve asked in other places if calling this situation ab-sive is too much, or... if it makes me a bad person... i’ve even gone so far as to continuously look up ab-se, and look up old conversations. i’ve looked up if not being comfortable with a partner’s alters dating is okay and found people who agree that everybody needs to be comfortable and consent and talked to beforehand, and i didn’t get any of that. in essence... i found people that agree that it’s okay to not be comfortable and that there needs to be consent, but... i’m still so... terrified.
i feel... like it’s wrong for me to feel this way, almost. i feel guilty for feeling like this. do... i really not have a right to be this hurt and this uncomfortable?",ExistingCactuss,2020-04-15 16:23:49,3,2005,23.92,28.15,79.46,11.07,12.23,12.42,92.22,60.9,21.05,12.72,9.93,0.25,0.3,0.5,1.75,8.33,3.89,14.56,10.52,7.63,7.98,2.14,23.19,4.39,2.49,0.85,0.35,2.04,6.53,2.69,3.84,1.2,0.65,0.95,10.02,0.05,0.05,0.35,0.15,13.72,2.69,1.4,2.39,3.64,1.85,4.24,4.54,0.9,2.34,1.2,1.15,0.3,0.6,0,0.05,5.54,1.6,1.05,1.65,0.65,0.85,10.17,8.58,1,11.97,1.85,5.54,4.94,0.25,0.05,0.15,0.1,0.05,0,2.79,0.05,1.7,2.54,0.15,0,25.19,14.51,4.94,0.05,0,0.25,0.05,0.6,0.5,4.04,0.1,0.15
g25f24,(Sexual Assault) Am I being dramatic?,"Hi Reddit, I’m a 17 year old female so please be kind I’ve never gone through something like this and I’m just very emotional and sensitive right now. I was recently sexually assaulted 2 months ago I’m currently going through the process of getting justice but i’m having a very hard time coping with my feelings. It’s already a very hard subject for me I get very emotional talking about it. 

My problem is I have a very hard time watching crime shows and my mom loves them. I used to love them too but after all of this it’s really hard for me to watch because a lot of the victims are women who were raped or murdered by people they trusted. I cannot watch these anymore or even hear it. I know I might sound dramatic but I get very anxious. I tried telling my parents, It took several times until I just broke down in front of them after asking my mom to change it again. 

On the other hand, I’m just tired of the sexual assault jokes. My dad has posted a joke about Joe Biden assaulting women and of course that’s the first thing I see when I open social media, I told him just stop it’s not funny. If you’re going to post things like that then just block me from seeing it. He got mad because he said “it’s not like I posted it to offend you”. Well, I believe you shouldn’t post things like that on social media because you don’t know who you’re going to offend making jokes like that. 

I’m sorry but it just pisses me off. I’m tired of feeling like i’m being dramatic, If I am then please let me know how I can cope with this. I’m currently feeling very anxious so please be kind. 
Also I want to add, I don’t know anything about Joe Biden so please don’t come for me I don’t know anything about him.",throwaway16553,2020-04-15 18:29:53,4,338,8.43,22.08,88.18,10.73,18.78,13.02,95.86,60.65,25.15,16.57,12.72,0,1.48,1.18,1.18,8.58,3.25,12.13,11.54,9.17,7.1,2.66,21.89,5.33,2.66,1.18,0.89,1.18,9.47,4.14,5.33,0.59,2.96,0.59,10.36,1.18,0,1.48,1.48,11.54,2.66,2.07,1.48,2.66,0.59,3.85,5.03,1.78,0.89,2.37,2.96,0.59,0.59,1.18,0,7.1,1.78,0.59,2.07,1.78,0.89,4.44,15.09,1.78,11.54,1.78,2.37,6.8,0.3,2.07,0,0,0,0.3,0.89,0.3,0.3,0,0.3,0,15.09,5.03,2.07,0,0,0.3,0,0,0.59,6.51,0.59,0

I'm 15, depressed, and have chronic pain solely due to stress and fear.

I don't remember ever playing with my dad or my mom. I've never played catch, played dolls, hell, not even hide and seek. They've always been 'busy' (drinking and getting high)

I have memories with my oldest brother. He's nice. But he hides everything and only pretends to be nice. I know he's broken too.
My second oldest brother used to hit and scream at me alot. I don't ever remember being happy with him for more than a few hours. Then back to yelling and insults.

I have a good relationship with my grandparents. They've taught me alot recently.
Apparently, families are supposed to have dinner together. Same with lunch. And breakfast. My family eats separately and we don't speak to eachother.
Apparently, families are supposed to tell eachother what they are doing. Mine doesn't. I don't remember the last time my parents told me why they left the house unless I outright ask them, which I shouldn't have to.
Apparently, families are supposed to trust eachother and not blame eachother for mistakes. in my family, if you drop a plate on accident or trip, you get yelled at for being a 'fucking retarded f*g' (they know I'm gay)..


I felt safer telling my grandparents I was trans than my own father. my Christian grandparents. Isn't that crazy? 

I get yelled at from crying in my room at night, or not going to sleep until 4-5am. I have insomnia and horrible depression, anxiety, and a few physical disorders that are not diagnosed (I twitch and my arms will flick out without my control sometimes, kinda like Tourette's?) And it will cause me to sometimes be loudish at night. I try not to be but I can't help it.



I feel broken.
I feel like I can't do anything without being scolded.
I feel like I'm not respected.
I feel like a failure.
I feel like I never be good enough.
I feel like I want to die.
I feel dead inside.
I want to die.",charlie-is-cool,2020-04-15 23:52:14,5,357,21.04,7.27,98.35,3.85,9.39,17.65,93.56,55.46,20.17,17.93,14.29,0.28,0.56,1.12,1.68,2.24,2.24,12.61,11.2,3.64,6.72,5.32,23.53,6.72,3.92,0.84,0.84,1.4,8.4,3.08,5.32,1.12,1.96,1.12,10.92,3.92,0,0.28,3.08,18.21,4.76,1.12,1.4,4.76,1.68,5.88,4.2,0,1.4,2.8,4.2,0.56,1.68,0.56,1.4,7.56,3.36,0.56,1.68,1.4,1.4,5.32,15.13,1.12,11.48,1.4,4.48,5.88,0.84,2.52,1.96,0,0.56,0.84,1.12,0.84,0.28,0,0,0,23.81,10.36,4.2,0,0,0.56,0,0.28,0,6.44,1.68,0.28

g2d1hc,Coworkers Want To Move Past What Happened,"Just needed to vent a little.

I escaped an abusive relationship, and I'm currently seeing a therapist for diagnosed PTSD and depression that resulted. My ex worked at the same job for a while until she was fired, and her damage control was to spin the whole thing to be my fault because she was so ashamed and afraid of her coworkers learning what she did. She threatened my life three times and had her family also make threats against me, and said I better not share any information that would threaten her job.

To her coworkers, she was a flirty, cheerful and misunderstood person with a good heart, who met the wrong person and dumped them. She was fired because she kept calling out, to be with the guy she cheated on me for, but that's not how her coworkers saw it.

It's been over half a year and those coworkers try to approach me and smile and include me in conversations, but I want nothing to do with them. The few times I tried to open up they usually will say they don't want to take sides because it's been so long, and they like both of us, we just weren't right for each other. But it's not that fucking simple. I had my life threatened. I had severe trauma inflicted over a long period of time that I'm going to be trying to process for much, much longer. I'm sorry, I think much less of you for wanted to be friends with my ex-abuser, and trying to underplay what happened because you're uncomfortable with dark topics. So that's why I avoid them and I don't respond to them any more, and I don't care what they think of me.

I can't fall asleep without every cell in my body hoping you finally overdose. Or you finally piss off the wrong person. Or your careless driving turns you into a firey pile of ash, so you can never hurt me or anyone else ever again. I'm distraught from waking up in a panic, over and over, because you hard-coded into my DNA that I'm unsafe even when asleep. I no longer have any trust or love for anyone, because you took every last bit of mine.

People always say you should open up about abuse, but they don't always want to listen. Being pushed aside and not taken seriously is soul crushing. Again, mostly referring to my super happy ""positive vibes only1!!1!!"" type coworkers who keep trying to make conversation with me while telling me life isn't that bad and I'll ""get over her"".

They don't understand I don't want her back, I want me back.",OverloadedRift,2020-04-16 04:16:26,1,458,20.84,56.95,52.65,1,19.08,13.54,95.85,58.73,21.62,16.59,8.3,0.44,2.18,3.49,2.18,5.02,3.49,13.1,9.39,5.02,9.17,3.71,19.21,4.8,1.31,1.97,0.66,3.28,10.04,3.06,6.99,2.18,2.18,0.66,15.72,0.22,0.44,3.49,0.22,15.07,1.75,2.62,2.4,3.49,1.75,4.15,1.97,0.66,0.87,0.44,2.62,1.09,1.09,0.22,0,10.92,2.4,1.97,3.28,1.75,2.62,5.46,12.01,0.87,13.1,2.18,6.33,5.02,2.62,0.22,0.22,0,0.22,0,0.87,0.44,0,0,0,0,16.38,4.8,4.8,0,0,0,0.87,0.44,0.87,4.59,0,0

g2oh44,How do I try to separate my past abuse from my current relationship?,"So my dad was emotionally abusive. I escaped that situation a month ago. I now live with my boyfriend, who I am in a healthy relationship with. I have noticed that my tendencys from living with my dad the last 18 years has transitioned into this current relationship. 

For example, when I lived with my dad I always had to walk on eggshells, ask for permission to do things, etc. I've noticed especially over the last few days, I've been doing the same thing with my boyfriend. ""Are you okay if I (insert activity here, like painting, sleeping, shower etc). When I ask things like this, internally I acknowledge these are silly questions, that he doesn't care, it's my living space too. 

I'll say ""bf, I know this is a silly question that stems from me living with my dad, but are you okay if I...""

I'm walking a fine line between doing whatever the fuck I want (because he doesn't care, these are things my dad would care about or wouldn't let me do) and feeling like I'm disregarding my boyfriends feelings. 

I'm partially asking him these questions out of the kindness of my heart and because of trauma. I can't find a therapist in my financial range right now, but can't wait to go back again. My boyfriend has been extremely supportive of me and treats me the best that anyone ever has. I am so grateful to be in a healthy relationship and could really use some advice to try to separate my trauma from it all, if possible.",helpmeplease2023,2020-04-16 14:48:47,3,275,19.3,14.58,95.63,83.81,18.33,18.55,93.82,61.45,24,16.73,14.91,0,0.73,1.09,0,7.27,4.36,12.73,12.36,5.82,6.18,1.82,22.18,3.64,1.82,1.82,0.36,1.09,6.91,5.09,1.82,0,1.09,0,9.82,1.82,1.82,0,4.73,14.18,3.64,1.45,2.55,4.36,1.82,4,1.09,0,0.36,0.73,3.64,0.73,2.18,0.36,0.36,5.45,3.27,1.09,1.09,0.36,0.36,3.27,16.73,0.36,12.36,1.45,4.73,6.55,0.36,0,0.36,0.36,0,0,1.45,0.36,0.36,0.73,0,0,18.91,5.82,5.82,0,0,0.36,0,0,1.09,4.36,1.45,0

We used to get hit with a belt whenever we did anything wrong, and while some people may call that “discipline”, I call that instilling fear and anxiety into your children to the point that they are terrified to admit their wrongdoings or confide in you for a n y t h i n g. 

That “discipline” did not make me a better person at all. It made me afraid to speak my mind, make mistakes, and express my emotions. So now everything I feel is bottled inside of me and the only times I can let it out is after they’ve gone asleep, and then the only one I can speak to is God. And I just beg that he can hear me and that he will help my little brother to not go down the same path of mental illness and distorted thinking as I have.",vcruzbb,2020-04-16 14:50:44,15,209,18.52,81.84,53.54,1,19,11.96,91.87,60.29,22.49,17.22,8.61,4.31,1.44,1.44,1.44,5.26,3.83,11.96,10.53,3.83,9.57,2.87,19.62,7.66,3.83,0.96,0.48,0.96,8.61,1.91,6.22,2.87,1.44,0.48,17.22,1.91,0,0,2.87,10.05,2.39,2.39,0.48,1.91,0.96,2.39,2.87,0.48,1.91,0.48,1.91,0.48,0.96,0,0.48,10.05,6.7,0.48,2.39,0.96,0.48,6.22,11.48,1.91,10.05,0.96,4.78,4.31,0.48,0.48,0,0,0.48,0.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.4,3.83,3.83,0,0,0,0.96,0,2.87,1.91,0,0

g2qroi,finding justice for my long term childhood trauma,"hi everyone. this is my first time posting in a public group about this so bare with me if i'm bad with grammar or bad at explaining all of this.  if you have any questions or suggestions or feedback, please comment below.

i'm 19 years old and i live in a household of domestic verbal abuse from my elderly grandmother. i have clinical depression and severe anxiety. ever since i was younger, my grandmother has been verbally abusive towards myself, my two older brothers, my mother, and especially my grandfather. as she's been getting older, her psychological issues have worsened, and refuses to seek treatment. i currently live with my middle brother, my grandfather, and my grandmother. my eldest brother had moved out a little over a year ago due to the constant emotional abuse from my grandmother. my mother moved to a different state a few years ago, so she doesn't see the everyday struggles that my grandfather and i go through. my mother has never been any help with my depression and anxiety. she's the kind of person that thinks it's just a phase and blames my therapist why i haven't ""gotten better."" so i don't usually vent to her about how my grandmother makes me feel unless i want to rant on how much of a fucking asshole she is. i've spoken to my grandfather about how i'm feeling, and had suggested that we put her into a home since she can hardly take care of herself and she's afraid of being home alone. he has acknowledged that her mental health is only getting worse and how often she emotionally / verbally abuses him on the daily, but he refuses to put her into a home. he tells me that he's ""too far gone into the marriage to leave her"" that he ""can't put her in a home"" and letting her abuse him like this. but i can't take it anymore. my middle brother keeps to himself, especially because his room is in our basement so he doesn't care enough to do anything, although he knows that this is a problem.  i'm posting this to find justice for my childhood trauma and daily life of domestic abuse. i don't want a restraining order against her. all i'm looking for is to put her into a elderly mental facility. i've even recorded my grandmother screaming at my grandfather as evidence to prove that she has problems that can't be taken care of by my grandfather, or anyone else in my family. this has really taken a mental toll on my life and the people around me and i'm tired of sitting around letting this women control my life. i'm tired of my anxiety keeping me up at night because i feel so utterly uncomfortable in this house. i want to feel like i have a home, not just a house i sleep in.",illustratedghost,2020-04-16 16:53:44,2,491,27.97,39.55,72.81,1,18.88,19.55,94.09,59.06,23.42,18.33,11.61,0.41,0.2,6.11,0,5.09,4.68,14.05,8.96,5.7,7.74,2.04,16.9,4.68,2.44,1.02,0.61,1.43,6.92,1.02,5.91,1.22,1.83,0.61,14.66,4.28,0,5.91,4.28,13.03,2.65,2.24,1.43,3.05,1.83,3.87,1.63,0.41,0.41,0.81,2.65,0.41,2.04,0.2,0,7.13,2.24,0.41,2.24,1.63,1.02,3.05,13.03,0,14.05,1.83,6.31,5.7,0.41,0.2,2.44,0,0,0,0.41,0.41,0,0,0,0,14.26,5.09,3.26,0,0,0,0,0,1.22,4.48,0,0.2

g2vp57,Child sexual abuse?,"(TRIGGER WARNING) So I already posted this here a while ago, but I have had a lot of people tell me the more I say the story the better the easier it gets so I am posting it here again and hopefully they were right. This is not me asking anymore as much as it is a reminder, reassurance for that doubt. And just getting it out there. Thank you 🙂

Thank you very much for the add. My name is Daniel and I just turned 19.

Ok so one of my biggest problems is the doubt I have about the abuse. I don’t know if what happened constitutes assault and I have been having doubts about it. So I am asking for the opinion of people on this page because it just is really bothering me.

So when I was 12 I was at my uncles cottage and I was in the lake with the neighbour’s kid who was ~3-4 years older than me I think, and we were play fighting kind of. He brought us to a place in the lake that was covered by trees so no one could see us, and he pulled me towards him and wrapped his legs around mine and held them closed. He was holding my wrists before he reached down and started touching/grabbing me through my swim trunks which were just soccer shorts. I don’t know how many times he touched me, it may have only been once I don’t remember. I was trying to escape and I was saying stop. It didn’t last very long I don’t think and he didn’t really do anything but touch and grab me. Does that count as sexual assault? Sexual abuse? Molestation? I don’t know anymore. It’s just really overwhelming. I hate feeling the doubt along with the pain. It makes it so much worse.",Daniel_128,2020-04-16 22:25:04,10,314,6.33,29.4,64.62,1.31,14.27,12.42,93.63,63.69,22.93,15.61,10.83,0.96,0.64,2.55,0.64,7.32,5.41,8.92,12.1,9.24,9.55,2.87,21.34,3.5,3.5,1.59,2.23,2.23,8.28,2.55,5.73,1.59,2.55,0.32,9.87,0.32,0.32,0,2.87,10.83,2.23,1.27,1.27,3.82,0,3.18,3.18,0.32,0.64,2.23,1.91,0.64,0.32,0.96,0,7.32,0.96,0.64,1.91,1.27,2.87,7.96,10.83,0.64,10.83,1.59,4.46,4.78,0,0.96,0.32,0,0,0,0.32,0,0,0.32,0,0,13.06,5.73,1.59,0,0,1.27,0,0.32,0,2.87,0.64,0.64
g2xlbq,Was I abused as a kid?,Today I was thinking about why I’m so fucked up. I started thinking maybe something happened in my childhood. So I thought about how when I was younger my mom punched my head and pushed me into wall. She slapped me a lot. My dad was a drunk and he used to cuss me and my sisters out and hit us. I used to get yelled at for getting hurt. I burned my hand recently and I was scared to tell my parents because I was afraid that they would be mad and yell at me. I grew up fast too. I learned to do things on my own and keep my emotions hidden from my parents. And today I am scared to get in trouble even from teachers. I can’t be yelled at without bursting into tears. I’m scared to upset my mom and dad because of what will happen. Is this normal? I thought everyone’s parents do this. They also dismissed my emotions. I wasn’t aloud to be sad or angry. Even now they don’t think I know what love is. They keep saying that we don’t love each other but me and my partner have been together for almost 3 years. Was I abused? Please I need to know.

To my mom: I love you but i can't stand living with or visiting you alot because: your bf called me a fa\*\*\*\*, bf pushed me up the stairs when i was younger, bf punched my in the arm, bf constantly tells me im not a valuble part of the family, you locked me in a room with a bottle of pills (and told me knives are in the kitchen) and told me to kill myself, you let me try to run into the road and kill myself, you contstantly manipulate and emotionally abuse me, you threaten to kill yourself when things dont go your way, you put me in the middle of your fights

 To my dad: I love you but I can't live here happily because: you fight and yell too much, you have a slight drinking (alcohol) problem, you have drugs (weed) in your house and that makes me uncomfortable. You are a control freak and also narcissistic, you try to control every aspect of my life (kinda understandable cause you are my dad but still), racist, homophobic, transphobic, you and amy are emotionally and verbally abusive, if i even poke you (accidently usually),  you hurt me 10x harder, you constantly threaten to hurt me if i do something wrong, you treat me more like a housemaid than a child, when one of your friends were here (maybe cody?) i told you about bullying at school and you told me to stop being a pussy and then picked me up and tried to throw me over the porch railing (you didn't but still), you have a loaded pistol in your bedroom, you put me in the middle of your fights, you throw things, i am genuinely scared of you, you put drumming before spending time with me. You fight to much with your gf,",jaymorrison12,2020-04-17 08:54:05,3,405,28.53,75.54,91.23,1,57.86,13.83,91.11,60.49,24.69,21.48,11.11,0,9.14,0.25,0.99,3.21,5.19,12.35,5.43,5.43,9.14,1.73,14.57,3.95,2.47,0.99,0.25,1.98,6.91,0.99,5.93,0.99,3.46,0.99,17.04,1.48,1.48,0.49,1.98,12.1,0.99,2.47,1.23,3.95,0.25,5.93,1.48,0,0.25,1.23,3.7,0.49,1.98,0.49,0.99,7.41,2.47,1.23,2.47,0.49,1.23,2.96,8.89,0.74,12.59,2.96,5.68,3.46,0.74,0.99,1.48,0.25,0,0.74,2.22,0.49,1.73,0,0,0,16.54,0.99,6.42,0.99,0,0.49,0,0,0,0.74,4.94,1.98
g35697,Not sure if I'm in the wrong for bringing up my abuse to my narcissistic mother.,"Ok, so, I posted this in r/raisedbynarcissists but it's kinda fitting here and I need advice.

I'll try to keep this short and not too detailed because I don't want to trigger anyone.

For some background: my mom (narc, 53F) favours my older sister (21F) because she looks like her and my mum believes she's autistic (she hasn't even attempted getting her diagnosed). I've (19 F) been in the process of getting diagnosed with ADHD for almost 2 years. My sister always has to be in the spotlight with all the attention and it's her way or no way. She's ruined my birthdays in the past (this year, we went to the garden centre because that's what my mum wanted to do, regardless of if we came with her or not and it obviously couldn't be the next day). My sister would always have some kind of party and strop off in order to get people to run after her if she wasn't getting enough attentuon. Growing up, she's gotten my friends to hit/bully me. I've just gotten used to not being considered because my dad (53M) has always told me to be chill for an easy life.

My sister beat me up for the majority of my childhood, to the extent that I feared for my life.
My school therapist would call this abuse but I always shrugged it off until recently and now I'm feeling a lot of resentment. Even petty things upset me because I feel like it's never been resolved?

It stopped when I was about 13 and I tried to talk to my mum about it and how it was impacting my mental health. Every time I brought it up, she would tell me to get over it and it wasn't that bad and my sister couldn't help it? She'd get angry at me when I tried to say that I didn't feel safe because she said she didn't know what to do so I need to move passed it. I tried talking to my sister when I was younger, she sort of half heartedly apologized and then used the same excuse my mum does that she ""couldn't help it"".

Every single time I'd argue with my sister, regardless of what my sister did, mum said it was ALWAYS my fault. I couldn't ignore her cus I ""know she hates being ignored"" but even if I answered nicely, there was no way to stop an arguement with her, last time she cornered me on the bus and screamed at me until we got off. She then ran away and hit for ages to scare my mum, she was 20.

The last time I spoke to my mum about it was a few weeks ago. She said that my sister is ""autistic"" and that means that I have to do whatever I can to make sure she's happy. My sister has not had a single diagnosis with autism and even if she was, I'm not sure if it's an excuse for the way she treats me? She doesn't hit me anymore, she just screams and tries to control everyone's lives (to the point where she's even tried to dictate my birth control). My mum also screamed at me that I ""don't have ADHD!"" When I tried to ask her for some support for it later in the conversation.

I'm honestly not sure what to do at this point. Nothing my sister does is ever wrong, my mum constantly makes excuses for her and does everything for her to be happy. If my dad steps in to try to discipline my sister, my mum gets angry at him and claims my sister ""doesn't understand"". This would happen any time he tried, whether my sister was 12 or 20.

Mum won't hear anything about my mental health and my dad tries to help but he's not very empathetic. I feel like I'm all on my own. Recently I've started to get crying attacks with an overwhelming feeling of not being good enough. I'll be going to sleep and then seemingly out of nowhere just bawl for hours. Whilst this is happening, I just rip my confidence to shreds by telling myself I'm not good enough for X Y and Z reasons. 

Maybe I'm in the wrong for trying to get support from my mum when she's busy with my sister? I know my sister is obviously difficult (autism or otherwise) and perhaps I should just get over it?

Any advice would be gratefully received, thank you for reading :)",Autographtree,2020-04-17 09:21:23,3,778,18.41,28.15,70.86,16.57,20.47,12.72,94.09,60.03,23.26,17.35,12.08,0.39,0.13,4.76,0,5.91,2.96,13.88,11.05,4.5,7.84,3.73,21.85,3.47,1.29,1.67,1.16,1.8,6.3,2.83,3.47,0.51,1.29,0.39,13.62,4.24,0.13,8.23,0.77,15.68,2.7,1.93,2.96,3.73,2.83,4.11,1.93,0.13,1.16,0.64,1.29,0.13,1.16,0,0,9.9,3.34,1.8,2.31,2.06,1.16,5.78,11.95,0.9,13.11,1.67,4.76,6.68,0.26,0.26,0.13,0,0,0,0.51,0,0.39,0.13,0,0,16.45,3.98,2.7,0.13,0,0.64,0.13,0,1.29,5.27,2.06,0.26
g35pqj,Need help,"This is my first time doing this sort of thing, but after tonight I'd like to get this off my chest and ask for help/guidance. My father has always always acted out of anger at the most meager of things, such as a joke or even a simple conversation may lead to him misinterpreting something as you insulting him. During my years as a 5-10 year old I always question whether a father should instantly result to hitting you, even if the what I did was meager or even when another person told him to do so, my brother at the time could just shout or squeal and instantly my father would come over and hurt me (fully knowing i did nothing wrong). When I started hitting puberty, his attitude towards me became worse, I was 11 - 12 and had gotten overly angry at my brother cheating in a game we were playing, this attracted him over(my father). As I started to become more emotional (dying over and over is not fun :p), he started laughing more and more until I overreacted and punched a chair. At first it seemed like your average telling off, I was told to go to my room and stay in there for awhile, but out of frustration I nonchantly closed the door harder than usual, which caused my father to burst through the door and start yelling at me, things escalated and he grabbed the nearest HDMI cord and told me to bend over, I refused because I didn't understand why he was so mad, after that he grabbed me and pinned me to the bed and tried to choke me, acting out of pure hatred and confusion I kicked him off of me and in to the wardrobe behind the bed. Afterwards both sides of the family were  contacted and my mum let me come to her work and my grandfather let me stay for a couple nights. My mum later received a call from my aunty whom I was close to, basically telling me it was all my fault for causing the fight and trying to justify his actions against me by saying shit like clean your room and listen to your father. My father then goes back to his country and asks if my brother wants to come, when my brother says no, he starts enticing him with gifts and whatnot, however he still refuses. He goes back home and happily ever after right? Well no, he's basically his family's wallet and they get him to buy stuff for them and pay for his stay when he doesn't have a job, after finally figuring out hes being used he comes back and has no place to stay. So my mum being the kind person she is let's him back in and thinks we need a father. This repeated about 4 times and now both my brother, my mum and I are done with it. However, because of recent events pertaining to the coronavirus, have being unable to send him to the first house we bought (our great grandmother lives there), in addition he doesn't have a job and can't sustain that household. So we let him live here longer than intended, but today he started drinking with my aunty over the phone and carried on for a couple of hours, later he comes into my brothers room and starts yelling and swearing at him, I go to intervene and afterwards it escalates to him insulting us and whatnot (doesn't get physical because we can now basically beat him up xD) we end up calling the police as he's not leaving us alone (including my mum), when the police show up they do nothing because he hadn't hit anyone or property and he basically told them the reason for him shouting at us was because my brother had failed three subjects and we are staying up late (it's holidays). They ended up chalking it to us being the stereotypical disobedient children who play fortnite (my friend wanted me to play with him). So here we are. Although I know I'm not a perfect son or an obedient one at times, I'm still unsure if his behaviour is warranted, because if the police did nothing, am I the one wrong? I just don't know at this point.

g367cw,COPING STRATEGY,"If you have trouble sleeping during the night because of abuse or any mental illness, this is for you....

The only place my parents give me relative privacy is the bathroom. (Sometimes my mom unlocks the door and walks in on me anyway, but for the most part, I have some privacy.) If this is true for you too, the bathroom is the perfect place to get a little extra sleep. Bring as many towels into the bathroom as you can without it looking weird to your parents. 3 is ideal. If you have a rug or mat on the bathroom floor, spread it out as much as possible all over the floor. Put one or two towels over the floor. Use the remaining towel as a blanket or roll it up to make a pillow. You can keep two towels on a towel rack and the third towel on the floor for future use. Obviously it won’t be too comfortable, but if you’re tired, it’ll be enough. Make sure you set a timer on your phone so that you don’t sleep too long, or else your parents may get suspicious.

g375ma,Things I want to say to my parents,"I'm writing this to get things off my chest and also to see if I am just spoiled as my parents say I am, and obscuring the reality, or whether they are toxic/abusive. It's predominantly about my mum and is very long! Also in r/toxicparents 

Edit: am not in any danger, living away from them now and am free from suicidal thoughts 

1. I should have been allowed to have birthday parties. I respect they are a pain and came with a cost, but all I wanted was to feel part of something. That shouldn't have been denied. This is fairly mundane, but when you add it to the rest it's significant. 

2. Children living on council estates, of different ethnicites or of parents you didn't like shouldn't have been off limits to me. You had no right to raise me with these awful prejudices and let me think it was normal, especially the racist ones. And mum, being girly or popular or interested in others isn't a bad thing. I am now prejudice and judgemental, I struggle to keep friends and I am very lonely because of it. 
You both also don't have any friends. Thank you for passing that to me, it has took years to undo and I fear it never really will. 

3. Mum, you slapped me round the face on several occasions (age 7-18). I remember it knocking my glasses off my face when I was little, and feeling shameful that I had to pick them up. I was in a school uniform and I was a child. When I was older, you had no right to continue doing this. 

4. Mum, when we moved (14 y/o) you cut me off from my old friends when you knew I was struggling to make new ones. Yes they were goths. No they were not losers. When they did come to see me (something you tried to stop on several occasions until their parents drove them to me) you got into one of your famous moods and I spent the whole day afraid I had done something wrong, and would be punished on my return. That was the best/worst days. I never saw them again. 

5. Mum, when you found out I was self harming you dragged me to my room and threw me to the floor. You then came back in with a Stanley knife and told me to kill myself and get it over with. I was grounded and cut off from technology so had no contact with my friends. 

6. Mum and dad, when you found out I was being groomed at the age of 14, you insisted that it was somehow my fault. I thought these men saw something in me that made me special and set me apart from the others. I was being bullied and constantly told I was ugly. Your anger at me for being stupid only fuelled my desire to continue the relationships in secret. It wasn't really explained to me that it was wrong. When dad found out he punched me. I was sexually abused by men twice my age for years, I only fully realised that well into my adulthood. 

7. Mum you mocked me for being too thin and not eating all of your impossible portions. I developed anxiety about eating and it took me years to finish a meal and accept my metabolism stopped me putting on weight. I'm still convinced I look emaciated. I still struggle to finish a meal. I have since learned from a therapist that due to your own blatantly obvious mental health issues which came out in moods, anger, irritability and verbally/emotionally abusing me - this was one of the few things I could control. I got one over on you by not eating properly...

8. Mum, when I told you I wanted to see a councillor and a doctor about my strange feelings you told me none of them could be trusted. You said they would drag up pointless things from the past and turn me against you. I still went but felt like I was betraying you. Turns out you probs just knew they'd tell me what an emotionally abusive arse you are.

9. You also said a lot of what I remember from childhood didn't happen the way you said.

I've been told since in therapy that it probably did happen exactly like that, but I don't trust that still. Even now I worry I am lying or remembering things incorrectly and this has rippled into every aspect of my life. It has led to me being in strings of abusive relationships/friendships and being in dangerous situations because I think I'm probably perceiving the situation wrong. You robbed me of my conviction and my sense of judgement. I now have no self esteem or confidence. 

10. Mum, you told me that you suspected dad cheated on you in like the 80s and unburdened a lot of your marital issues on me. Me and my siblings have all caught you sobbing uncontrollably and listened to you as you broke down about your marriage, your life etc. It was awful to see this but it made me feel responsible for your well-being and guilty when I displeased you. It ruined my eldest siblings relationship with my dad and mine too for a while. You used to ask me if i saw dad with anyone when i met him on the commute home. It was fucking weird! How did you ever think that was ok? 

11. Mum, when I was given herpes by someone who knew he had it and never told me and then gave it to several other women thanks to my silence, you did everything you could to blame it on me. Slut shamed me, told me its because i shaved my pubic hair (also you crossed boundaries with coming in while i was showering, bathing so you knew I shaved ""i made that body its mine to see""). 
I was devestated, I felt like pure dirt. 
When I came home you gave me my own towel despite explaining it cant be caught from towels or toilet seats. You also stopped me going to a guy I was datings new years eve party because you couldn't explain to dad why i was running around with a new guy when i was riddled with herpes and said it would be hard to defend me to him and my brothers when i am immediately hopping into a new guys bed.

A guy who knew what was wrong with me and accepted it anyway at a time when I didn't ever think i could be sexy or desirable ever again. I broke it off with him because I assumed I had no right to be with someone new. Thanks for that. 

12. When i then attempted suicide you both left me alone in the hospital while I vomited repeatedly. I was scared and alone and I kept trying to get in touch, but you didn't answer. You told me you could never forgive me and ripped up my suicide note, which would have been key to my theraputic sessions/recovery. 

You had a similar response to my next two attempts and shared that you and my siblings had made jokes about me having painkillers for dinner. You also went through my social media accounts and my phone - so i had been totally exposed. You made me answer for every single message, including one about my sexual preferences. None of this had anything to do with my suicide attempts, they stemmed from the shame of having herpes, a shame you perpetuated and encouraged. 

13. Mum, when i called months later the moment i found out my friend from uni had tragically died from a health condition, in floods of tears, you told me that it should put my suicide into perspective and make me realise how stupid I am. You said the fact I was sad was ironic seeing as she was sick and dying and  i was healthy and had tried to take my own life. I will never forgive you for that. I still feel guilty that she died and I lived, and that somehow my suicide attempts did her a disservice. 

14. My alcoholic brother was abusive to me for years, told me he hated me as i was wheeled into the ambulance after attempt number 1 and called me a slut for having herpes on a regular basis. When i eventually stood up for myself you put (and continue to put) the onus on me to apologise. I will always refuse to do that.
The apple doesn't rot far and you totally created a monster and he attacked me for years. 

15. Mum, when i eventually hit you back for hitting me for coming home a bit drunk at 18 years of age (legal in uk) and falling down the stairs (also was not violent, loud or paralytic. I was just drunk and a bit sloppy but overall happy!) you claimed I started it and everyone was livid at me for hitting my mum. The only way I could get out of it all was to lie and say I was ""on drugs"". I wasn't. I had just had enough of your abuse and controlling me. 

16. Mum, a year ago when I came home something was off. It was like I was a kid again and you were pass aggressively ignoring me, being curt etc. When I confronted you it turned into an argument where i was accused of being selfish and never considering your health or issues. I didn't know of any health issues, aside from a few appointments. 

I said i knew you had had appts for your heart and you said. Word for word: ""Its not my heart actually its my lungs. Shows how much you know."" 

When I said I had no idea you had these appts and you had never told me, you retorted ""I have fibrosis of the lung and might fucking die"". I instantly realised what was happening and stopped talking to you much after that. You threw a terminal diagnosis in my face to prove a point and win an argument.

When I was 4, my cousin (also 4) and I were inseparable. We played games like house, Lego, and zoo. The games be played always were a bit.. strange. At least on his part. He look lick our “baby” (a doll) in the private parts. I didn’t think of it. We are 2nd cousins and he had a crush on me. We were both little and didn’t understand what “crush” meant. The games we played got weirder, and sometimes he would make me kiss him. One day, the most vivid memory, (We were probably 5) we were pretending to sleep in our game of house. He told me to come here. He threw things at me and hurt me when he got mad, so I came over. He told me to kid him. I said no. He asked me again. I said no. He grabbed me, put a thin see through cloth between our lips and pulled me on top of him. I laid on top of him as he did something. That’s all I remember. It turns out, he was sexually abused by HIS cousin, so he thought that was how you showed someone love. I don’t know if he remembers. But I do. I see him all the time. I am scared of him. I am only in 6th grade, so I need to tell someone about this? Is it bad or not?

g3egan,"31F/Identical twin, abused my father and identical twin sister","\*\*ABUSED BY\*\*\*\* not my 

&amp;#x200B;

his is going to be long.

I was sick weeks ago with COVID-19 symptoms. I was tested 19 days  after symptom onset and ended up negative but developed pneumonia and lung imaging consistent with coronavirus. After I received all of this information, my sister started calling people and saying that I just ""wanted attention"" and was ""dying to be sick.""

I woke up in the middle of the night both choking and drowning on myself. I did not WANT to be sick. But people with mental illness (what she has, I'm not sure) struggle to understand.

I moved back to New York after my partner died in our home in 2017 in California. I came back, unwillingly, because my father told me I had to. From that day, my sister has lodged a campaign to get me kicked out of my parents' house. She pays no rent, never has. She has never moved out. She's literally a leech making six figures, offering college counseling while being simultaneously insane. When I was first quarantined, I bought wipes, hand sanitizer, paper towels, toilet paper. My sister said we would not be using anything that I provided because ""everyone wants me dead.""

She has done things from changing the WiFi password so I can not take work calls (she does not pay for WiFi) to making noise when I'm supposed to be teaching. I teach.

This Wednesday, the state called me for a testing appointment -- I did not need it anymore. I am no longer symptomatic but my uncle and father were and I wanted to offer them the ability to be tested. My uncle came with me.

I began filming my sister as she was on the phone talking to my cousin saying I was just ""dying to be sick"" because I ""wanted attention.""

She fake cried, and my dad grabbed me by the hair, slammed my head on the dining table, slammed my head on the wall, slammed my head on the floor, and grabbed my phone out of my hand so I could not dial 911. I kid you not. I rushed over to the landline phone to call the police and he continued hitting me and told me that ""he dared me"" because if I ""called the police, \[I\] would end up dead."" My sister grabbed my phone and deleted videos of herself being abusive towards me, that I took as evidence. I recovered them just now so I am not concerned.

The police heard me screaming and him yelling threats and did show up. He actually left the house before they could arrive, and my sister told them that it was a ""mistake"" to have them called.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this is where I am because I want to know what my options are here. I know I can get orders of protection (I left), but I would like to press charges against my father for slamming my head all over the place and what I think was likely attempted murder.

&amp;#x200B;

I need help. I would like to press charges against my sister and my father but what legal recourse do I have? He did physically assault me, and I honestly believe he was trying to kill me. And my sister was laughing in the background encouraging it.",livefromnewyorkits12,2020-04-17 17:54:27,3,569,28.69,23.56,78.13,5.32,16.26,16.34,91.56,56.77,22.14,18.63,14.41,0.35,0.18,2.81,0.88,3.51,3.69,11.42,9.14,2.99,7.03,2.64,18.98,3.16,1.76,1.23,1.05,0.53,4.22,1.05,2.99,0.35,1.41,0.18,12.65,3.34,0.18,3.16,2.64,11.42,1.93,1.58,2.81,1.05,1.05,3.34,3.69,0.35,2.11,1.23,3.16,1.23,1.76,0,0.18,7.73,2.81,0.88,3.16,0.88,0.35,8.79,7.56,0.35,11.6,1.58,5.62,4.92,2.99,0.35,0.7,0.7,0,1.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.39,5.8,4.22,0,1.05,0.18,0,0.53,2.81,0.7,1.05,4.04

But when she mentioned it, she said we can do that again, and then I proceeded to give her a kiss, but we were both very grossed out by it, and never did it again, but the question is pretty much, did I molest my sister when she was sleeping?

That same year.  My stepdad died. He was the only father figure I had in my life and it shook my whole family.  And caused me to develop anxiety and self harming issues.

Almost 30 years old, has no job, very unhygienic. He is verbally abusive about myself and my mother to his online friends.
Claiming depression, derived from an incident I called him worthless, he also claims poor memory thus is unable to remember to wash, do chores etc.
But somehow remembers the one ""nasty comment"" I supposedly made over 5 years ago.

I myself have a job working in a popular pub in a heavy tourist destination. I have my studies.
I have sever anxiety and depression, but that's not to stop me from making a life etc.

But he claimes I'm a ""worthless, dirty bitch"". I do nothing around the house and I sit around all day spreading shit about him.

Let me explain the basics:

He used to force me to stay up at night when we were young, and he would touch himself in front of me.
He would deter any friends that came to mine, and say mean shit about me, eg I'm a slut, I'm a nasty, ugly bitch... Etc.
He used to try and strangle me, hit me, pin my down etc.
Used to tell me to watch him as he touched himself til he...well you can guess.

All the while I used to try to escape, spending my time at relatives' houses both over holidays as well as having to miss school.

His maltreatment lead me to he a recluse, and events turned to me trying to end my own life 

But I grew up, got a job, got some amazing friends, all the while still being told that I'm a layabout bitch.

Now the time has come that I have to move back home, and I have told my mother that it is me, or him. I will not love with him.
I cannot afford to live elsewhere, and I am the only child who is willing to be a decent human and look after her home whilst she works full time on terrible pay.

My brother on the other hand, over the years has squandered money, and even stolen and sold some old items of my mother's, and in which case is more then comfortable to move out.

But she is torn.
She doesn't want me to go, because if I leave, I'm gone for good; I can't have someone like him be prioritized, not after all the shit he did to me, and then has the nerve to claim that I once said he was worthless.
And her POV is, what am I supposed to so. Where would he go. I can't just tell him to leave.

Fyi, she is scared of him. He has knives in his room and is prone to huge adult tantrums. He is also not a small man by any means.

So, I need advice.

What can be done
Where can he go
Can we get him facilitated, since I'm so damn scared he's going to force his way into my room one day and attack me?
What the actual hell can we do about this??

TL;Dr
My mother is too scared to tell my rapey, abusive brother to pack his 30 y/o ass up and leave home, and I'm terrified to hell he'll attack me one day. Is there a situation where we can make him leave?",some_kinda_everyday,2020-04-18 10:31:00,15,615,31.64,39.72,50.92,1,16.18,10.73,92.03,58.86,20.16,17.4,10.08,0.65,0.16,6.5,0,2.76,4.88,13.33,10.73,5.53,7.8,1.63,19.67,4.55,1.46,1.63,1.3,1.79,7.15,1.63,5.37,0.81,3.09,0.98,12.68,1.63,0.49,1.79,6.5,9.76,0.98,2.11,1.14,2.44,0.98,2.6,1.3,0.33,0.33,0.65,2.6,0.98,1.14,0.33,0,7.8,2.11,1.14,3.41,0.98,0.33,4.07,14.31,1.14,15.12,3.09,6.83,5.53,2.11,0.33,1.79,0.98,0.33,0,2.6,1.79,0.16,0,0.49,0,17.07,6.67,5.85,0.16,0.33,0.65,0,0,0.65,2.6,0,0.16

g3tmtf,Home alone with my abuser,"My boyfriend is abusive. Two years ago someone in my building called the cops and hes hasn't hit me again until last night. It was just a slap but it hurt. I went to bed and stayed out of his way. 

This morning he woke up and started drinking. I was avoiding him for the most part. I have two small parrots that when hes sober anoy him enough but I guess drunk he couldn't take it. as I was feeding them he came in and grabbed one trying to squeeze it. I screamed and the bird got away but then he turned on me. He grabbed me by the neck and started choking me hard with one hand and smashing me in the face with the outher. He then went for the bird again. I used my body to block his way he threw me on the bed and beagan choking me again. After he let go he yelled at me and hit me in the face. When he left the room I quickly gatherd the birds and put them in their cages and covered them so they wouldn't make noise. 

Since then he's been getting drunk and yelling abuse at me from another room. I'm trying my best  stay out of his way.

g3v0jv,"can parents be abusive but still celebrate your birthday, etc?","my parents always hit me when they were angry at me. they used a ruler until i was about five, and then from ages 6-16 they used one of my dad’s thick belts. when i was little and i knew i would be spanked, i would run out of fear and my mom would chase me around the house until she caught me. every time i was spanked, my mom would make me strip, pull my pants down, and hit me with the belt until i was cry and begging her to stop. i always got the feeling that she enjoyed it and that she was taking her anger out on me.

i was demeaned and punished for expressing me feelings. my mom would scream at me (not yell, *scream*) and slam things. if i cried, they would threaten to “give me something to cry about”. my parents always invalidated everything i felt, (to this day) including things like panic attacks, depression, and suicidal thoughts. about two months ago told my parents i wanted to die while crying and the literally ignored it and didn’t even try to help.

 that being said they still give me money every now and then and celebrate my birthday and buy me food and stuff...

now i’m stuck home in quarantine and my mom still gives me looks and becomes passive aggressive. she never asks if i’m okay, just “is something wrong” when she thinks i’m giving her an attitude. (if you want to call being extremely depressed and upset most of the time while also being forced to cope with it alone because you parents never supported you when it came to your mental health an attitude, then go ahead). i cant get therapy. i cant even cry. i spend all my time in my room because i just don’t want to see them.",DerDeprimierte,2020-04-18 14:03:12,44,322,10.1,35.46,87.66,1,17.89,13.35,94.72,59.63,23.91,19.57,13.66,0,1.55,2.48,1.86,4.35,2.48,10.87,8.07,6.52,11.49,2.17,20.5,2.17,0.62,1.24,1.55,1.24,8.7,1.24,7.45,1.24,2.48,2.48,13.04,3.11,0,3.73,0.31,13.66,2.17,1.86,3.73,2.17,3.11,2.48,3.11,0.62,1.24,1.24,1.24,0,0.62,0,0.62,7.45,2.48,1.24,3.11,0.93,0.93,7.14,9.32,1.24,15.84,1.55,4.04,10.25,0,0.93,0.93,1.24,0,0.62,0.31,0,0,0.31,0,0,16.15,5.9,4.04,0,0,0.31,0,0.31,1.24,1.86,1.86,0.62

g3wg4i,I feel horrible for defending myself..,"Lastnight my boyfriend and I got into a silly argument. It escalated really fast and he ended up pushing me around, putting his hands around my throat and burning my face with a cigarette.. this is the second time he's burnt me with a cigarette. He has a handful of times put his hands on me, but he's mostly just controlling and emotionally abusive..but all this week he's been acting out in semi violent ways if something didnt go his way and I guess I just got fed up... and I repeatedly decked him in the face... I never in my life thought I would hurt someone i love like that... even though he hurt me first I feel like  a monster that I stooped to that level. To his level. I feel like what I did was worse than what he's ever done to me. I should've just walked away, but the moment he told me it was my fault he burned my face with that cigarette I lost control.. it wasn't his fault I punched him, it was mine and i regret it and i cant stop crying. I will never be able to forgive myself!

 I'm not asking for advice on what I should do with my relationship. I know it's time to call it quits...

g40iqn,I think outrage over all types of abuse is actually toxic,"The way we handle conversations about abuse is really important. Taking a stance of ""let's find the one true villain and cut off his head"" harms people living through abuse. I think the power imbalance inherent to abuse makes it likely that the victim might get mobbed/re-victimized by outsiders. 

I don't think interventions that take children away from their dysfunctional families should be the default, although I'm not sure that it is. I actually believe in working together with dysfunctional parents to support them and give them the tools they need to better take care of their kids. I know that for a lot of people, the idea might sound humiliating, but it's a stigma that needs to go away.

After the age of like 12, all the way through maybe 28, I thought my parents were evil people. At some point I started learning more about myself as a survivor, and now that I understand how I reacted to the dysfunction and abuse, I see how easy it is to fall into the same traps yourself. I think abuse tends to be passed down from one generation to the next, and people don't have enough insight into their situation or themselves (they're traumatized) to avoid it. Bitter pill...

We need to be able to have conversations about abuse that are empathetic towards all parties involved, regardless of whether they ""deserve"" it or not. It's not about what they did that was so wrong, it's about giving everyone the tools to build better lives for themselves and about being unconditionally kind because it's the right thing to do.

To respond with total apathy feeds the problem, but so does blind indignation and anger. There's a lot in between that has the power to change dysfunctional families for the better.",BN975,2020-04-18 20:11:04,3,312,67.94,61.36,32.46,1.27,20.8,18.27,92.31,55.77,16.03,9.29,4.49,0.96,0.32,0.32,3.21,6.73,7.05,16.67,9.29,5.13,6.09,1.6,19.87,4.17,2.56,1.28,1.28,2.56,10.9,3.85,7.05,0.64,3.85,0,11.54,1.28,0,0,0.32,16.03,3.85,1.92,1.92,2.88,2.24,3.85,1.28,0.64,0.32,0,2.24,0.32,1.6,0,0.64,11.22,3.85,1.92,3.21,2.24,0.96,1.6,15.06,0.64,8.33,1.28,5.13,1.92,0.64,0.96,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.42,5.13,3.53,0,0,0,0,0.32,1.28,3.21,0.64,0.32

g4172l,*POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING* Is this abuse?,"When I was 4, my 2nd cousin (also 4) and I were inseparable. He was so sweet and nice. One day, he changed. He got angry easily and would throw things at me. We played house and other normal kids games. Sometimes he would tell me to kiss him, and if I said no, he would hurt me. He had a crush on me (we were little, we didn’t know what crush meant) One day when we were playing house, he told me to come here. I came over and he was laying on the bed. He told me to kiss him, I said no. He threw something at me, (he was strong) then said that he would but a thin see through cloth between our lips so they weren’t touching. When I got closer, he grabbed me and pulled me on top of him. He made out with me, then... I don’t remember. I don’t remember what happened next. I later found out that he was sexually abused by HIS other cousin, and she told him it was a game. I haven’t told anyone about this, but it really bothers me.

g429g3,Who's fault is it?,"So i(16M) was doing my chores minding my business and suddenly my dad comes in begins overreacting and  scolding me in a pretty angry tone about a bag of snickers not thrown in the trash which i know nothing about. Turns out my mom was the one who forgot to throw it away. She says it was her fault, and my egotistic prick of a dad wont back down and continues to accuse mom of always protecting and covering me. So i was just angry he wont shut the fuck up about a little bag of snickers so i just walk off to my room. I was pretty angry(because dad always does that letting his pride and ego take over) almost on the brink of exploding and i hear dad hitting mom. I was outraged i walk back i push him off mom he tries to grab me my mom comes between.My dad has had a history of beating up my mom and grandfather while drunk he beat up my mom twice and my grandfather(his father-in-law) once. He is screaming ""Look at the kid you raised"" even though they raised me together. I said ""I swear if you touch my mother even once i WILL NOT STAND BY"".

g42b71,Escalating abusive household,"From what I’ve been told both of my parents were raised in households where inter-partner violence occurred regularly. They perpetuated this countless times throughout me and my brothers lives. It’s always riled my brother up moreso than it has me, but now he has recently gotten out of the military which intensified his animosity. He has been psychically and verbally abusing my parents as recently as a month and a half ago. Now that we’ve sheltered in place I have only grown more restless and need to make sure that he is controlled with me in NorCal and them living together in Socal. They’ve called the police frequently, both after altercations psychical and verbal.

g43638,"I highly doubt it, but is any of this legal?","So my boyfriend (13 trans male) recently came out to his family as transgender. They’ve always been really hard on him about pretty much everything, but after he came out, they’ve been so much worse to the point where he’s become extremely depressed and suicidal.

They’re extremely religious and are constantly using his birth name and female pronouns thinking it’ll “change him back.” All they’ve actually been doing is make him more dysphoric and depressed by doing this.

I looked at multiple sites about child abuse and sent him one and this was his exact reply (I looked for the message just to get everything right):

“Let's see 
For neglect there's withholding medical care and telling me not to eat so much though I barely ever eat and believing in ""faith healing"" for thinking god will heal my mental problems and not letting me get an std preventative for ""religious reasons
For physical there's putting me in a stressed physical position  and again depriving me from medical attention 
For mental there's mocking me and yelling to silence me not allowing me to express opinions without interrupting or just saying it's not right cause they say so emotionally blackmailing me and limiting physical contact with others”

One day they got into a huge argument about him being trans. His family was saying things like “LGBTQ+ people are all communists” and “Only men and women and men with women and nothing else.” Then his mom said something like ""If you’re not gonna be a girl, we’re gonna put you in foster care.” 

They do a lot of sexual things as well. I asked what they did and this was his exact reply:

“The bastard constantly spanked me ""for fun"" as a child, and always walked in on me in the bathroom and didn't walk out or say sorry and just kept saying ""you're (this finally ended in third grade so it was basically 5-10) so you don't need privacy"" and in 4th grade he walked in on my friend in the bathroom and stared for like 2 or 3 minutes than just smiled and said ""sorry little lady, at least you don't need privacy yet"" and he also took my door and replaced it with a  very sheer black curtain that constantly falls down

Birthgiver always stares at my ass whenever I'm in something short like when I'm just in a sweatshirt or long shirt while I'm in my room and never knocks whether I'm in the bathroom or in my room and always stares whenever  she sees any private parts when she walks into my room or in the bathroom cause she doesn't knock or if I accidentally flash anything even super minorly when it's barely visible she notices immediately and points it out

Grandma always walks in the bathroom whenever I'm in the shower (which the shower door you can easily see through)  normally and totally nonchalantly and says ""we have the same parts so I'm allowed to see so you shouldn't care"" And always stares into the shower when she walks in on me in the shower 

And grandpa also constantly walks in on me and never says sorry and normally just smiles and also spanks me ""for fun"" or ""in good humor"" and has tickled me close to private areas (lower stomach, upper thigh, etc.) And has rubbed my thighs and my knees sexually and if i say not to do any of these things he just says I'm being uptight and need to loosen up”

(He doesn’t call his parents things like ‘mom’ or ‘dad,’ he just calls his mom ‘birthgiver’ and his dad ‘the bastard’)

Because of all of this, he’s become really suicidal and has a mindset of “The only way to get out of this hell is to die.”

His parents are also constantly checking his phone and social media, so that’s why I’m the one posting this instead of him.

I’ve been wanting to tell my parents about what’s been happening but I don’t know much about things like this. I don’t know what they can do, what’ll happen if they do do something, what happen to him, and if whatever they do will even be helpful.

Anyone got any insight, advice, tips, etc.?",Paxton-Gray,2020-04-18 23:49:30,16,723,13.95,63,54.74,15.96,48.2,16.32,94.33,59.89,18.4,13,5.95,0.41,0.97,4.29,1.38,5.39,3.46,12.86,9.82,9.41,12.31,2.49,19.78,3.73,2.35,2.35,1.24,2.07,5.39,2.35,3.04,0.41,1.11,1.11,15.63,1.66,0.41,1.94,4.56,13.28,1.52,1.38,1.8,3.87,2.77,4.7,4.01,1.66,1.94,0.41,2.77,0.97,1.11,0.41,0.41,5.12,1.94,0.28,1.38,0.97,0.55,4.15,12.03,0.97,15.63,2.35,8.3,5.12,0.41,1.38,2.35,0,0.69,0.41,1.11,0.55,0.41,0,0.14,0,16.6,1.94,2.35,0.14,0,0.28,0,0.14,4.56,5.53,1.52,0.14

Rats, mice, roaches, spiders, black mould, sludge you name it. My dad is a raging alcoholic. This particular night he bashes into my closet-sized bedroom (it has no door handle...so yeah absolutely no lock...) and started beating me up.

g4505k,Does this trauma from the past show itself like this for anyone else?,"Hi all, I truly hope you're all doing okay, so I'm now 28F but as a child my mother had serious addiction issues that led to physical and verbal. Personally it was always the verbal that hurt me the most. Luckily when I was 16 she hurt me in front of friends, child services were involved, came to my school, and I have not seen her since. 
    Although it's been years since I've spoken to her I find I am pretty spineless when it comes to sticking up for myself. I NEVER raise my voice or share an opinion I think someone may be even slightly upset with. I feel this may be because as a child I was shut down and screamed at for every thing I did constantly. 
   Also nightmares. I honestly can't believe how frequently my mother is still in my nightmares even though it's been over a decade since I've seen her. It's always her on top of Me, dragging me, ripping my clothes, screaming. And just feeling general fear. Does this happen with anyone else? 

Hope everyone is okay during quarantine. I know this situation is so difficult to speak about. I RARELY share this side of myself with my friends. I don't like darkening the mood, and I feel it's so unrelatable. All this quarantine alone with my thoughts is hard. I've been trying to put it into my art more.

g47kty,Can I leave my mom and abusive step dad at 15?,"Lets start this with the basics, I'm 15 turning 16 in November, I live with my mom, my little sister and my moms boyfriend. We'll call him K. MY mom met K when I was little and he was nice to me until they had my sister in 2010. Because I'm not his kid, he treats me like crap.

**A**: When I had the in flu, in February, he made me go to school because I was ""healthy enough"" to be on my phone and watch tv. At school I could barely keep my eyes open and was sent home by the nurse. He was mad when he and my mom had to pick me up from school. I was grounded and couldn't do anything but sit on my bed. No tv no books no nothing.

**B**: Last night, I was sleeping and had my phone in my room, and he came in turning the light on and screaming at me because I had it. Apparently I'm too young to have it in my room at night but old enough to watch my sister. I also can't go to my grandparents house because i have to watch my sister while he brings my mom to work.

**C**: Emotionally abusive. He calls me names every day. Stupid, retarded, bitch, etc. When my mom is in the shower he makes me wait to go to the bathroom even though my mom doesn't care and there's a wall separating the toilet and the shower. I ended up peeing myself once. When I get home from school and have to pee he doesn't let me because I should use the bathroom at school and then screams at me for being a germaphobe. If i forget to do anything he asks me he grounds me and tells me ""you always forget"" or "" You don't forget"" He tells me my achievement mean nothing and that I'll never live up to be as good as him. I have to sit through belaboring and long monologues that makes it clear K thinks I'm beneath him.

**D**: He broke my nose in 6th grade because I couldn't find his car keys in the kitchen. He wouldn't let me go to the hospital because he didn't want to get in trouble. My nose is still crooked from it never being fixed.

**E**: He is always trying to get my mom to move out of state and leave my family here. I would't feel safe without my family. He threatens to take my little sister away from my mom when she doesn't punish me.

**F**: Unpredictability\*\*.\*\* He explodes with rage out of nowhere then is caring or affectionate. He becomes dark and moody at the drop of a hat to keep me walking on eggshells .He threatens to take my computer (which i'm using right now to post this) that I need to do my school work. He would then ground me for getting bad grades.

My mom used to defend me all the time but is siding with him more often now. He blames him and my mothers relationship problems on me and my mom tells me she hates him. My family on my moms side hate k and would support me in my decision to live with my grandparents. My grandparents on my dads side have always been loving and supportive to me. They're the only stable home I've ever had. My grandparents live on town away and don't work full time so they could bring me back and forth to school. I would even change schools if I had to. I'm doing drivers ed soon and could even drive myself. My mom would be really upset with me but I could maybe come every other weekend or something.

The runaway law in my state says ""There is no crime of ""harboring a minor."" If an adult is letting you stay with them so you are not on the streets and you can leave their home at any time (they are not keeping you there), then no law is broken.""

"" When people think of domestic abuse, they often focus on domestic  violence. But domestic abuse includes any attempt by one person in an  intimate relationship or marriage to dominate and control the other.  Domestic violence and abuse are used for one purpose and one purpose  only: to gain and maintain total control over you. An abuser doesn’t  “play fair.” An abuser uses fear, guilt, shame, and intimidation to wear  you down and keep you under their thumb.

Domestic violence and  abuse can happen to anyone; it does not discriminate. Abuse happens  within heterosexual relationships and in same-sex partnerships. It  occurs within all age ranges, ethnic backgrounds, and economic levels.  And while women are more often victimized, [men also experience abuse](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/abuse/help-for-men-who-are-being-abused.htm)—especially  verbal and emotional. The bottom line is that abusive behavior is never  acceptable, whether from a man, woman, teenager, or an older adult. You  deserve to feel valued, respected, and safe.""

g4dl1g,I intervened in a Domestic Abuse,"So today I woke up earlier to my downstairs neighbor screaming, raging, slamming, and fighting. I sprung out of bed, got on a shirt and walked outside to find out what the hell was going on. I knock on the garage door and talk to my neighbor. I asked what's going on and that I'm concerned with the safety and well-being of others inside. I honestly can't remember what he said completely as he was so manipulative he denied all wrong doing. He then in a way agreed to wrong doing by rationalizing his thought, ""her last husband put a gun to her head and beat her"". I told him to his face that I don't take kindly to wife beaters or abuse of any kind and that I'm concerned for everyone's well being. 

He seemed to have this blank psychotic stare and exclaimed that he was concerned about her having sex with other men and whatnot. He seemed very controlling, cunning, manipulative, psychopathic in nature and had no emotion except avoiding eye contact. 

I remember vividly that just after he opened up the garage door the one child told me to call the cops on him but I have no evidence of him abusing his gf. 

I immediately texted his gf and offered her any help I could and that I'd listen to what she had to say. She later told me she was headbutted from him and that he hurt her one child from throwing items in a rage. 

I've tried offering my place to relax and recover while also suggesting she call the police on him to get him evicted . She told me the landlord knows but does nothing and I'm worried for her well being ? I'm not sure to call the cops  next time or what, the guy is clearly unstable and acts completely different when I talk to him so I know his deceptive capabilities. 


Long story short she just recently left and took her kids with her. If I call the cops they'd need her story as she witnessed it first hand and has a history of being abused (she told me) 

I really like the woman and want to help her any advice ?",Anavrin53,2020-04-19 12:19:56,3,377,33.14,80.19,11.5,9.47,20.94,14.85,94.69,59.15,23.08,18.57,7.69,0,0,10.61,0.27,4.51,4.77,13.53,7.43,4.51,8.75,1.59,16.45,3.45,2.12,1.59,0.8,1.06,7.69,2.65,3.98,0.53,2.12,0.27,21.22,0.53,1.59,6.1,6.37,10.08,2.65,1.06,1.06,2.12,1.86,3.18,2.39,0.8,1.06,0.53,1.59,1.33,0,0.27,0,9.28,2.39,1.33,4.24,1.06,1.06,6.9,6.63,0.8,11.94,1.06,7.16,3.71,0.27,0.8,2.39,0,0.27,0,1.59,0.27,0.53,0,0.8,0,11.14,3.98,2.39,0,0,0.53,0,0.27,0.53,2.92,0.53,0

g4dw0v,He did it again.,"So. I’m humiliated and at a loss so here I am trying to find some answer/advice/support. 

I knew he would but I stayed. 

My husband and I have been together for almost 10 years. Within that time he has cheated and hit me multiple times. It started out with pushing me when I was pregnant and still I stayed. Things escalated over time and there have been multiple domestic issues between us and infidelity (on his part). Then he had a long standing affair and I still stayed. 

Last night he drug me across our bed frame and my entire back and thigh are bruised—I’m having a hard time sitting/standing all because I told him he was being a dumbass (I know, not fair). I called the cops and then I lied to the cops because I was protecting him. 

I often look at the shell of the woman I’ve become. I am a (normally) outgoing, happy and optimistic person. People have always described me as strong, powerful...essentially the last woman you would expect to be in this situation. 

I don’t know what to do. Actually, I know what to do, it’s the doing part that is still breaking my heart. I just know what kind of a man he is when he isn’t like this and it sucks. It sucks for my kids—just a shitty situation. 

I don’t know how I let my self esteem become this low. To tolerate this or accept it as some kind of norm—it’s just sickening and makes me feel even more ashamed than what I already feel. 

I guess my biggest problem is sticking to the decision I’ve made to leave. I always forgive people (part of lack of boundaries and lack of self respect) but I just don’t know how what to do. I have a good support system but I feel guilty for relying on them again. 

I’m a stay at home mom and feel super isolated. I’ve neglected many friendships and relationships in my life to cover or lie about what’s really been happening. 

I just want to know from other people: 

•how did you rebuild your self worth? 
•how do you stay consistent in choices? 
•how do you not feel bad for doing what is right? 
•what helped you escape?",throwawayrelief777,2020-04-19 12:37:06,3,390,9.6,33.15,86.77,12.25,13.45,14.1,93.85,61.03,22.31,16.41,11.28,0.51,1.54,2.82,0.26,5.9,4.1,10,12.56,7.69,9.23,1.54,23.59,3.33,1.54,3.85,0.26,2.82,7.18,3.08,4.1,0.77,1.79,1.03,10.51,0.77,0,0.77,3.33,15.9,5.38,2.31,2.05,2.56,1.03,3.08,1.79,0.26,0,1.54,1.54,0.77,0.77,0.26,0,6.92,1.28,1.28,2.56,0.51,1.79,5.13,15.13,0.77,12.82,2.05,6.15,6.15,0,0,0.77,0.26,0,0,1.03,1.03,0,0,0,0,16.92,7.18,1.28,0.26,0,1.03,0,0,0,3.33,2.05,1.79
g4eexs,"I don’t know if this belongs here, but here it is.","After someone hurts you for long enough, you become used to feeling that kind of pain. It sounds easy enough to leave that person and start over, but it rewires your brain. You start to almost crave that pain again, even though it makes you feel miserable and worthless and hopeless. It’s the familiarity of it that brings you some sick form of comfort. Then, you go the rest of your life subconsciously seeking to feel that pain again, whether it’s through self destructive tendencies or through another person that wants to hurt you or even both. You’re stuck on this cycle of not necessarily loving the person, but loving the way they hurt you, because you almost feel as if you deserve to be hurt. You’re punishing yourself for something. You crave that pain yet you crave real love, too.

g4gv35,My Best Friend Suffers Emotional Abuse Right in Front of Me and Can’t Help Her,"Had this first posted on r/relationships but had to repay here:


So I (21F) live with my best friend (24F) and her boyfriend (25M). She and I both suffer from bad anxiety and depression so we really understand each other’s feelings and emotions even without really talking about it. 

They’ve been together for almost a year now and there’s a lot of toxicity in their relationship. They repeat fights and arguments constantly because they never try to change for each other. They’ve broken up a lot and keep getting back together and are just overall not good for each other. Lately she’s been having a really hard time with her family and her boyfriend has been prioritizing himself over being there for her. Their last argument was because “she ruined his week” by being upset about her mom possibly dying after losing her grandpa like 2 months ago, losing their home, and losing her job. But he got mad at her because he was looking forward to “having a chill week.” There’s been a lot of times she’s walked out of her room or something and I’ve noticed cuts all over her arms and legs. She’s been refusing to talk to me about it, but I really just want to be there for her. I’m trying to give her the space she needs because I get that way too sometimes, but I only see her getting worse and she won’t let me help. And I want to help so badly because her boyfriend isn’t protecting her or helping her. She’s depressed. She’s sad. She feels alone. And the one person that really needs to be there for her... well he’s too selfish to care. 

What do I do? I try to ask her and she stays very vague. 

Now I’m finding out she’s really starting to overdo drugs. She’s doing coke, she’s asking her plug how much meth prices are, and drinking too much. I’m so scared for her, and I can’t help. 

Please help :( I just want my best friend to be okay.

TLDR; my best friend’s boyfriend isn’t there for her when she’s depressed and anxious. She cuts herself and he doesn’t care and she won’t talk to me. Now she’s trying to buy drugs.

I stayed at his place as opposed to mine and we were always laughing and being intimate. I understand the novelty eventually wears off, and especially during a hard time like a global pandemic- but I'm not sure what to think of his evolving behavior. Someone please give me insight here before I make a decision.  


When the pandemic began, he figuratively began ripping his hair our (understandably so), and it was really difficult to watch. I tried to always lighten his spirit, and he began to become extremely irritable, anxious, and dissociative. I made him dinners, always made him feel special and was playful when appropriate. He would nonstop talk about this (I mean, aren't we all right now?), and it became a little taxing on my nerves, so much where I would just eventually space out because I've seen the news enough. As long as you take protocols, you should be incredibly fine.  


Incident #1

About 3 weeks ago, I decided to have a couple of drinks and make dinner. I was a bit tipsy I'll admit, but I'm a very chipper drunk anyways. I asked him out of my tipsy impulsive brain  
""Hey... ;) Tell me why you love me?""  
He looks at me immediately, with a dirty look and says ""I'm not talking to you while you're drunk.""  
I immediately say ""Woah, what do you mean? I've had two beers. Tell me why though, do you love me? ;)""  
I get the silent treatment. So... I begin to confront him and said ""Hey, don't be rude, we're in this together. I didn't like that.""  
It eventually evolves into a bitter match, and then I say ""Listen if you're stressed and don't want to be with anyone right now, I get it and I can just leave.""  
He says ""If you want to break up with me that's fine, I'll just replace you.""  
And well.. that fucking hurt, so I called him an asshole, after just went really silent and went to the couch.  
In the morning I tried to talk to him about it, and said how callous the entire night was, and he cuts me off with ""Well I guess you shouldn't fucking piss me off so much. You're really annoying."" At some point I snapped and said ""Your anxiety is annoying too! But I don't say anything because I understand it sucks."" He says ""Oh yeah? I'll fucking remember that.""  


Through out the entire week, it has been little 'playful' comments like ""Ya want to get punched in the face?"", ""You're a fucking retard (In a singing voice)"", or he would grab my face gently and whisper ""Fuck you\~"". I laughed it off because I thought he was being a playful brat, but it hasn't stopped yet at all. Even today and it's been weeks. Also the passive aggressive comments of how annoying I can be. So, it wasn't enjoyable at all. I would try to poke him and play around with him, but it always became a playful wrestling match (But not too hard so I had no concern of me being actually struck), or a ""leave me alone, fuck off, go away"" thing.

Incident #2  
I have a friend ask me if I want to come over and have a couple drinks at their new house. Relatively safe friends, social distance protocols and I was reeeeeeeeeeeally stressed at the time because I never got an apology for what he said earlier. Since I was staying with him during this, I had promptly asked if I could go (Because he was getting extremely nervous, despite how GREAT our city is doing with quarantine and the people in it), and he immediately huffed and said ""If you go there, you're not coming back for 10 days. I do not care. I only care about myself in the end of this, and I don't want to fucking die."" I say ""I understand, but you see people also. It's a double standard, here."" He immediately cuts me off and says ""You're always like this when you drink!"" (I had one beer in my hand, my first, and it was a Friday at 8:30pm). I immediately knew that I was having a card thrown at me, and went to my friends house.

Incident #3:  
After that, you can assume that yes, he ""Put me on suspension"" as he called it. From then on, I just went to my house and chilled. I get it, he wasn't happy but I felt like I needed to escape from his overwhelming behavior. A stupid decision on my end, but I wasn't thinking straight because of the whole week prior. From then on, I kept getting awkward and strange messages I don't know how to respond to:  


""You should write me a detailed report of how lucky you are to date me""  
""I needed to HATE you to love me (A song lol)""  
""Want to get punched in the face?""  


I would always tell him that I miss him, horny, blahblahblah, and he would always evade my attempt at missing him, and would deliberately ignore it. But then, I would eventually do my own thing and then I'd get flooded with flirtatious messages, and the classic ""Do you miss me?"" text. You can say throughout the ""suspension"", I became incredibly confused. At some point I asked him if he cared and it would always become a dry, non-caring response like I was stupid or dramatic. I started feeling shitty so I pulled back. I asked him why he wouldn't Facetime me, or even swing by to say hello and he evaded that also.

Incident #4:  


We have a groupchat with our friends, and we always post random things. I was a bit excited, because at the moment I'm making a mobile game. I wrote in the chat ""I think I'm growing a neckbeard with how much I've been fleshing out with this game."" He responds in the chat ""I don't love her for her IQ guys"". The chat went kind of silent, because.. well, that's not fucking nice.

I called my best friend and start saying to her ""Is this because I'm too pushy? He's blatantly not interested in any of my hobbies, or anything I care about. Am I attention seeking?""

Mind you I do have screenshots of those previous statements that he has said, because well- I dish him out to my best friend for advice.

Incident #5:

My suspension is up, and I ask him if he wants to go for a walk- he says sure. I also have left some things at his place anyways so I wanted to go see him. He picked me up, after jokingly texting me ""Do I look like a fucking taxi to you?"" I rarely never ask him for a ride but I did that time.

Yesterday/Today:

\*\*\*\*\*\* This.. is where it gets really strange for me, and what prompted me to come on here so I'm not going crazy. \*\*\*\*\*\*

He goes ""Let's go to \_\_\_'s bonfire tonight."" I say ""Aren't you worried like last week? Like you put me in a suspension because of it and now you're fine interacting with people?"" He says ""I don't care anymore, it's fine, I was just mentally messed up haha""

I'm at his house, sitting on the couch, he walks up to me, grabs a pillow and whips it in my face as hard as he could. I laugh it off, thinking he's just playing and throws one back. So he sits down, we just watch a bit of TV, and I begin to playfully poke/tickle his belly. 

He then grabs my wrist, and starts squeezing while starring at me. Gradually squeezing harder and harder, still starring and I'm just blank. Then he pulls it in a way towards his knee and says ""I could break this arm like a twig."" I say ""You know, you're going to end up bruising me if you grab me hard like that."" He lets go. A couple minutes later, I look at my wrist because yeah- he squeezed so hard that my veins were sore. He catches me doing a quick glance at it and goes ""Aweh, does that hurt? Good.""

At this point I'm feeling really off.

SOMEHOW- must've been a run-on conversation of subjects, but we talk about a friend in our group that endured mental abuse. No joke, he says to me:

""How does someone not get (begins to chuckle) ABUSED?!"" then starts HYSTERICALLY LAUGHING, and it keeps on a stretch. My jaw literally drops because THIS IS OUR FRIEND OF YEARS HE'S TALKING ABOUT. I say ""I hope to fucking God you're not serious.""

He goes ""Well... maybe, maybe not the right choice of word there.""

I go on to explain the process of our dear friend of how it happened, and he goes  
""Mental abuse is okay when it's deserved.""  
""Pardon me?""  
""Mental abuse is okay when it's deserved."" with no hesitation.

At this point my brain is WTFing right now, and I'm having a flood of emotions, but I maintain my composure- but all I know is that I'm packing my stuff and leaving in the morning because that's NOT OKAY TO SAY AT ALL.  


We go out to our friends' bonfire and had a pretty relaxed time. He was super happy, charismatic, and was really engaged. I was surprised to see it. He was being nice, holding my hand, and just being polite. I was just confused in general, as he downed a 6-pack and I had 3 myself. Went back to his house and went to sleep.  


He wakes up today around noon, and I'm leaning over him, expecting a kiss or something I guess lol. And he looks at me, graces my cheek and fake-throws a punch and I flinch pretty fucking hard. I say ""You gotta stop doing that or I'm going to end up flinching whenever you come near me."" and he says ""That's the goal!"" With a pouty face.

I went silent for a couple of hours and just scrolled on my phone. He was making us lunch, and he'd just walk around and 'sing' thing like ""\_\_\_\_ you're such a fucking retard\~, you're such an arrogant little prick"" and I notice my hands begin trembling because I haven't heard ONE NICE THING for weeks. I say ""Hey, my friend really needs me and I'm going to go back to my house"" He says ""Okay, I'll drop you off!""

But in the last hour he begins to cuddle me, says he's had a great time, and to text him later (which I would assume he'd want me to now). As he's dropping me off, he goes ""Have fun doing whatever you're doing."" But my friend literally swung by and we had a chat and a beer. She said that he's doing a ""testing phase"" and understands my dissociating and denial. So here I am now, typing to this thread. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also need to have you all keep in mind that I do have multiple screenshots, texts, and proof of me just asking for love, reassurance and him just saying... that garbage. He made me fall SO HARD FOR HIM and this is making me so goddamn confused. I know in my heart this is wrong but I'm in a crossroad where I think ""It's just a phase right now, it'll be fine.""

g4iw05,My brother (M17) is very emotionally abusive and pushed me (F21) for the first time today,"Background: My brother (M17) has always been a trouble maker but as he entered his teenage years, he has gotten worse. My dad being an alcoholic and my mom has depression. It gets crazy in the house once in a while. My parents are often fighting but me and my brother are usually not involved in that. Now that we have been in quarantine, it has gotten worse at home. Therapy has been mentioned, but has never been taken seriously. When it was brought up to my brother, he said “f*ck off, you need one yourself” 

My brother manipulates my parents, especially my mom. She usually believes whatever he says (where he is, who is goes out with, etc). She likes to have trust in her kids, which I completely understand. But that trust should be lost when your child is constantly lying left and right ...
Also, we found a bunch of marijuana things in his room hidden and he manipulated our mom saying that it’s his friends. His friends smoke and many have gotten in trouble with police. He is extremely disrespectful to my parents, but is even worse to me when they are not around. 
He says things to my parents like “You deserve for someone to spit in your face”, “I promise you, one day you will never see me again”. He takes the car when he doesn’t even have his license. I don’t remember the last time I actually heard him talk normally without him screaming or cursing. He gets mad over everything and anything. He refuses to even say hello/ good morning back in the morning to anyone, and gives a dirty look. He refuses to eat with the family, just because he knows it upsets my parents. Instead, he comes to eat 30 minutes later... the list goes on and on. 

Today, I was trying to make myself some food and so was he. I placed my pot down, and he didn’t like where I put it although it was not in his way at all. He took the pot and set it on the other side of the kitchen and said “I am here. You funny if you think you’re gonna be here too. Get the f*ck out of my way” I proceed with saying “but I’m not in your way. You have more than enough room” and put my pot back to where it was. He got back and pushed me against the cabinet. My mom was there and all she said was “hey hey hey that’s enough. Too much!” And he replied “she deserves for me to spit in her disgusting f**cking face”. I lost my appetite completely and locked myself in my room. My mom ended up telling him that he made me cry and got more joy out of it and replied “I don’t give a f**k, she deserves more than that. No one gonna be in my f*cking way. Stupid b*tch”. 

I just can’t stand it. My parents don’t discipline him. I know it may be harder now that he is older but it’s actually terrible here. I am afraid that he will end up on a bad path, if he didn’t already. He fights, lies, emotionally abuses everyone, threatens his friends with burning their houses down or hurting them (I overhear his convos from my room), and now he is starting to try to physically hurt his family members (me). 

What do I do in this case? Besides try my best to move out.",advice182182,2020-04-19 17:35:58,0,609,13.91,77.5,54.48,1.43,14.16,14.94,93.6,61.41,24.63,18.88,8.37,0.49,1.97,7.55,0.49,5.75,3.12,11.33,9.36,7.22,6.9,2.46,19.38,3.28,2.3,1.81,0.99,1.48,6.08,1.48,4.6,0.49,1.48,0.99,20.36,3.12,0.49,1.97,7.39,11,1.15,0.99,0.99,2.46,1.97,4.43,2.96,0.49,1.81,0.66,2.13,0.66,0.49,0,1.15,10.18,3.45,1.15,2.46,2.13,1.48,5.75,12.97,0.82,16.26,2.13,8.37,6.24,0.16,0.66,1.64,0,0,0,1.15,0,0.66,0.16,0,0,19.87,7.22,3.94,0.16,0,0.16,0.16,0,2.63,2.13,1.97,1.48
g4kwma,Are my parents emotionally abusive or bad parents?,"I have been distant from my parents my whole life and have found it hard to get close to either of them. They are sexist, homophobic, and racist which is partly why I stay away. 

They have made my nickname ‘pig’ and ‘hippopotamus’ because they think I’m messy (I’m only as messy as an average person) and I eat a ton (which is also not true and triggering because I have struggled with an eating disorder before). Those nicknames really hurt, because I am at a normal weight, and they constantly call me lazy and fat too. 

However that’s not it as they also constantly punish me for doing anything that isn’t to their pleasing, such as doing the dishes a couple of minutes after they told me instead of immediately after. The punishment involves taking away my phone and computer, which is pretty normal, however even if I need to do homework on one of those devices they won’t let me because I need to learn a lesson. They will also not let me contact my friends or go out anywhere when they punish me, which sucks because I don’t have many friends in general and this just isolates me further. They typically punish me anywhere from 1-5 times a week.

My parents also constantly criticize anything I do and shame anything they don’t like. I had to quit drama because they didn’t like me doing it and trumpet because they thought it was “too masculine” of an instrument. Whenever my grades dip because of my depression they will yell at me and give me a talk as to why it’s not an excuse and I am making stuff up. They also completely reject the fact that I am depressed even though I have been diagnosed by a medical professional and they have belittled me because of my problems by basically saying I should pull myself together. They constantly talk about how they had it so much worse and I’m just spoiled.

At the end of the day they also say that they are great parents to me and have said “you should be lucky we don’t hit you like other parents” numerous times to me. 

On the other hand, I still love them and feel conflicted everyday because I don’t know why. I think that they do care about me and we’ve had our family moments. 

I’m thinking about moving out and leaving them as soon as I can however I need to know if what they are doing is actually abuse or if I’m just imagining something.",Throwaway287595962,2020-04-19 19:53:46,3,439,2.87,30,82.69,2.22,24.39,19.13,95.9,68.34,24.6,18.45,11.39,0.68,0.46,0,5.92,6.15,3.87,10.93,12.53,10.02,12.76,2.51,20.05,5.92,2.96,2.51,0.68,1.82,7.29,2.28,5.01,0.46,2.05,1.14,12.76,1.59,0.68,0,0.23,16.17,2.73,3.87,2.05,3.64,0.91,5.01,2.28,0,1.14,1.14,2.28,0.46,0.91,0,1.14,7.06,3.19,0.46,1.82,0.91,0.68,2.73,12.98,0.91,9.57,1.14,4.1,4.56,1.37,0.46,0.46,0,0,0,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,0,12.98,3.87,2.05,0,0,0.23,0,0.23,1.37,4.33,0.91,0
g4lfbt,I have just found out my younger sister was in the same bed as my parents were having sex (multiple times),"Please I need an opinion on this.

Me (19) and my sisters (13 and 17) were discussing our parents’ relationship.
It came down to my younger sister explaining when she was 7 years old to around 11 she was in the same bad as my parents while they had sexual encounters. Multiple times(!) and since then she feels disgusted about sex, sexual relationships, puberty topics.

My parents were separated since I can remember.  My younger sister was sleeping with my mother in the same bed on a daily basis. My father was sleeping on a couch in our living room. This is just how it was. I even remember not questioning anything. It was just normal from the beginning. 
I shared a room with second sister.
Clearly remember ( as a child hitting puberty ) hearing sex noises from living room and feeling ashamed of that 
also disgusted.

I feel it deeply got into my sense of self, sense of my own sexuality. I cannot imagine what she feels and to what degree it had affected her. She was in the same room, faking sleeping and hearing all that.
We all might be traumatised because of that in a way. Physical abuse check for me, verbal abuse check for all of us including my father. My father’s been struggling with alcohol since I can remember. My mother had a phase when she was very toxic, manipulative and agressive. 
I’ve been exposed to seing porn video files on my dad’s PC by accident or caught him watching some sexual ‘funny’ pranks series back then. I felt appaled and hurt. 

I am asking you for advice. Should I consider it a sexual trauma for me and especially my younger sister. 
How can we understand this trauma and leave it behind.

g4m81y,"my first post, is this abuse? who should i blame for this? what do i do?","Am i ungrateful for being upset at my mom? i know shes my mom, but she does not act like a normal mom. She was mostly absent for the first 8 years of my life, we lived together but she never bothered to spend time with me so i didnt bother either because i had already started a detachment at an early age. i remember once she had watched porn in front of me while i was laying next to her when i was very young, maybe 5. She had hit me alot growing up because she has very bad anger issues and continue to do so until im 12. as i grew older the beatings would become more brutal. I've brought it up to her but she refuses to admit she ""beat me"" and she said she has only ""hit"" me a few times which is different from beating, but she has beat me many times, very harshly. i'd get beaten with belts, hangers, wooden spoons, shoes, id get freezing cold water dumped on me, and occasionally choked. there were times where they were more like fights rather than beatings, whered she tackled me or hit me first and started punching and pulling my hair and i felt as if i had no other choice but to hit back. She used to touch my boobs inappropriately but has stopped after years of me telling her it makes me greatly uncomfortable, it almost traumatizes me. she did not have any ill intent touching them, but it very much seemed like she did. she'd make very gross sexual disgusting jokes about other older men sexualizing me, me being raped, me being a whore and fucking whoever. She'd also overshare her sex life in detail and her friends sex life just to make me uncomfortable. she'd also purposely make me watch something very obviously provocative or animals being murdered when i was 7 to make me fear eating animals and sex, because she is a vegan and made her boyfriend vegan. my father had made me touch him when i was very young, maybe 4 or 5 or 6, and it traumatized me and she takes it very lightheartedly when it hurts just to bring it up and does not care. she can be very passive aggressive and does not take it seriously when i say that i believe i need help and that i am depressed. i clean the house and do chores and she continues to shame me for being fat, half white and not full asain, lazy, and not doing anything around the house, when i do clean and cook for myself while most other teens i know dont. I only weigh 104 pounds and i am 5'01. i have not grown since 6th grade whatsoever, i suspect it may be from malnourishment because i grew up with insomnia and often when nights without rest and barely ate. my mother made me self conscious of my weight and has encouraged diet pills, now i am eating a meal a day or less and diet pills everyday and am still called fat. she has picked on me for the way i walk, the way i run, anything i do thats athletic and constantly compares me to a fish on land, a pig, or a whale and tells me its a compliment just so i could look bad for being mad. now i am too scared to do anything athletic or run in front of people in fear that they might make fun of me. she constantly calls me names like bitch, piggy or non explicit names a 7th grader bully would use. and in arguments she tells me not to call her mother and that she doesnt give a shit about me, calls me curse words and other things. i go to cry in my room and she comes in while im crying just to shame me more and leaves the door open so the whole house can hear me cry, i go to close the door but each time i do she comes back to degrade me some more and opens the door to leave it open. i have no privacy, she goes through all my social medias and reads all my text messages and diary entries and does not tell me but makes small references to things ive said in the messages or my entries. she tells me and my family that i am a liar and manipulator. she says i disgust her. she tells my friends that i am fake and two faced and that i am terrible to her and that i am nice to them and that they shouldnt be friends with me. she blames all her problems on me. she tells her boyfriend to film me while i cry and get beaten and threatens to send it to my boyfriend, friends, and family. she also makes mean comments about my boyfriends sister and my friends to me and tells me shes only being honest and fights me for telling her that i dont want to hear it. She does not allow me to wear certain clothes, listen to most music, watch horror movies, watch or listen anything with curse words or violence in it, or curse while all my other friends do and their parents allow it, i am 15. but she allows me to take edibles and get a piercing. she is nice to me one moment and rude the next. shes hit me multiple times in front of a few friends and tells my family i watch porn and am a disgusting delinquent. but she was very relaxed when she found out i was smoking weed and supportive of me to quit, she did not yell or hit me, and she was not ashamed of me but very kind to me and took away my weed and pipe. this was the same thing when she caught me having inappropriate or explicit conversations with my friends or boyfriend or doing private things with my boyfriend. she is usually patient with me when ive actually done something wrong. but she often makes me uncomfortable by making gross sexual jokes and mean comments after i ask her to stop. there were times where she has hit me or tell me she had not loved me after i had not actually done or said anything aggressive or against her or with any attitude. i am only allowed 2 hours a day on the phone. and we have no tv or microwave and im not allowed to use one anywhere else, i am not allowed to eat outside the house without her knowledge either and she is very involved in my almost non-existent diet. there are times where she is unconditionally kind to me and she sometimes lets me do things most parents wouldnt allow and is open to getting most of the things i want. but i am very caged and infantilized. i am not seen as a young women in my house, but rather treated like a little 7 year old girl with the expectations of an adult. she also takes alot of things out of proportion when referring to arguments weve had, when she has been violent she later claims she was not being violent, she is either lying to herself or trying to manipulate me and tries so hard to make me believe it to the point where she makes it out that im crazy and manipulative. but she is usually very kind and allows me to do most things. but she does not respect my boundries whatsoever because she thinks i am unable to look out for myself and she can do whatever she wants to me just because she is my mother. am i bad for being so disgusted by my mother, even when she is kind or am i in the right for being hurt by all this and remaining unforgiving? she will try so hard one moment to gain my trust and to heal my wounds and the next she is a terrible mother and does not even claim to be my mother. is this woman bipolar? have i been through trauma or abuse? i feel very depressed in my home, have nobody to speak to about this, and want to kill myself.",chinkerbell_006,2020-04-19 21:31:53,7,1412,9.51,26.42,60.93,1,24.77,12.39,94.33,61.83,22.73,18.27,11.54,0.28,0,6.02,0.42,4.46,3.05,10.34,10.41,6.23,10.98,2.34,19.19,4.96,2.2,1.56,1.56,2.2,6.87,1.42,5.45,0.85,2.12,0.57,13.39,1.13,0.99,6.66,0.64,14.02,1.42,2.76,1.13,4.25,0.78,5.74,2.41,0.64,0.92,0.85,3.12,0.5,1.2,0.85,1.2,6.59,2.34,1.06,2.27,0.78,0.64,4.04,12.61,0.35,11.12,1.42,4.25,5.52,0.28,1.06,1.06,0.07,0,0.14,0.35,0.35,0,0,0,0,8.29,3.54,3.47,0,0,0.5,0,0.07,0.28,0.42,0,0
g4mei9,Is this abuse?,"This will be kind of long, heads up:

So my mom (F52) divorced her first husband for my dad(m62). While they were dating my dad would flirt with other women, and even told my mom WHILE THEY WERE DATING that he was going to have dinner with his ex wife to see if they wanted to get back together. Later on he had a TBI, and it was very difficult for both of them. According to my mom, he became more controlling and rude, but she decided to stay with him. 

Throughout my childhood I have always had problems with my dad. When he gets angry, he gives both me and my mom the silent treatment, but my mom has had it worse. He has hidden money from her on multiple occasions, flirts with other women but is rude to her, complains nonstop about any mental issues, people at work, and even bought a car without her knowledge. over the course of my childhood my mom has approached me about splitting up with my dad but she has never gone through it.

I’ve been in college for the past four years and I think it’s gotten worse. I’ve been home for a few weeks and have been able to see that- since I have been home I don’t think he has said one positive thing, it’s just been continuous complaints about his life. He disrespects her a lot, and I know she feels it too. It has also gotten worse as he has gotten older, as he is becoming more senile.

My mom band. My dad even had the nerve to call my mom “verbally abusive” because she told him to fuck off one day when he was being rude.

I feel like he emotionally abuses her, but also I’m not sure.

g4n53w,I need to talk and this is the only place I know where,"I was in a serious relationship for 6 months.  I had not had many relationships before so she was a lot of the first times I had done things. Like my first kiss or my first date. Through about 99% of the relationship I did not know I was being abused. I (at the time) Thought that abuse was always physical. I now through experience know it is not. First she would get very emotional and upset when I was away from the phone for even a couple hours, but she would disappear for days on end. This put a strain on me and my parents relationship, as when i I would be grounded I would find other tech to talk with her, or steal my things. Secondly year she would indirectly make me never leave and have me do everything in my power to support her emotionally.  She would say things like ""You are the reason I stopped cutting"" and ""If we ever broke up I would kill myself."" I felt trapped, I felt like I couldn't leave. I became suicidally depressed, but I couldn't show that to her or she would spread lies to her friends saying I didn't care about her and that I was using her to make myself  look better. I  took it out on others, but mostly myself. Finally She always put the blame on me, ""Your the reason I have body Image issues"" ""You are the reason i'm constantly depressed.""  Every fight ended with me being wrong and internalizing it. We broke up half a year ago, and although im happier, I'm still so unbelievably depressed.

g4o2bp,(F19) sexually abused by my older brother at four years old,"hi reddit. this is my first attempt to spell out exactly what happened to me in one place, so i'm sorry if it's too long or doesn't make the most sense.

when i was four years old up until i was about 5 1/2, my older brother molested me and made me do sexual things to him. he was about 9 or 10. it happened probably 5 times per year, so not often, but it was enough to hurt me psychologically. at the time, i didn't know it was traumatizing me. i was indifferent towards it. now i realize that thinking about it this way was how i coped. i didn't talk about it because he told me not to, i didn't know why it felt good, and i didn't know what else to do.

the last time that it happened, my dad walked in on it. we were in the living room, in plain sight, playing a video game on the xbox. all of a sudden, my brother paused the game and unzipped his pants. you can probably guess what happened after that--my dad walked in, saw what was happening, yelled at my brother, and the next thing i can remember is both of my parents sitting us down and angrily asking us what it was all about. i thought i was in trouble. i thought it was my fault. they never told me otherwise, i don't think, but i'm not the best person to ask--i don't remember anything directly after the confrontation. i think i dissociated for a few years after that, because my memory is very vague at best.

my parents never brought it up again. ever. i never went to therapy. *i never talked about it.* i wasn't sure it had really happened by the time memories started popping up in middle school. i thought i was sick for imagining those things. i developed depression and anxiety as a result of my PTSD (which would be diagnosed much later). it was difficult, but after going to a therapist for those two illnesses at fifteen years old (at the direction of my older brother, might i add) i told my mom about what i remembered, because i finally had a place to wonder out loud if it had happened. i was right. i had been molested by my older brother, who i (somehow) considered my closest sibling out of three. but after telling my mom this, i continued therapy and largely ignored the fact that i was abused. i didn't talk about it again because i had learned to cope that way. that was until i came home from my first year of college.

i finally decided to confront my trauma, so i started EMDR therapy, which was really helpful, but expensive. going to sessions during college (2.5 hours away from home) was too difficult, so eventually it stopped.

this brings us to the present day. i can't go back to trauma therapy because of COVID-19 and everyone is booked. i am now stuck at home with my family, including my older brother. i have since confronted him and he has apologized profusely. we agreed that we wanted a normal sibling relationship, or whatever normalcy means for us, because i still want to salvage whatever is left.

but i find myself becoming increasingly angry with him these days. i sleep in the same room as him, which is the very thing that started this abuse. (my mother is a big believer in sharing a room to promote ""close sibling relationships"". my brother apparently took to that too well.)

all i want to do is see him hurt for what he's done to me. i told him that i don't hold resentment for him during our conversation, but now i'm finding that i do. i'm trying to be kind to myself during the healing process, which i know will take a long time since i held it in for so long, but i feel so trapped during quarantine because i see him all the time now and am constantly reminded that my mental wellness and sexuality have been extremely damaged by him.

**tldr**; my brother molested me and i didn't confront it until college. i thought i wasn't angry and now i am.

how do i deal with this? do i tell him how angry i am? do i just avoid him? any advice is appreciated.",mostlyenergetic,2020-04-20 00:05:11,7,753,16.6,17.97,99,3.28,15.06,17.66,95.35,61.75,24.97,16.6,13.15,1.06,0.13,2.12,0.13,8.37,3.59,13.01,10.09,6.91,6.51,2.66,19.65,4.65,2.52,2.52,2.12,1.33,5.84,1.73,4.12,0.27,1.59,0.53,9.3,2.66,0,0.4,3.59,14.21,4.12,2.12,0.8,2.39,1.99,3.85,1.59,0.66,0.27,0.53,1.99,0.13,1.46,0.4,0,7.04,4.12,0.8,1.06,0.93,0.8,9.3,9.16,0.66,17.26,1.33,6.77,9.3,1.33,1.06,0.93,0.13,0,0,0.4,0,0.27,0,0.13,0,17.13,6.24,4.38,0,0.13,0.4,0,0.66,0.27,2.52,1.59,0.93

g4q7uj,I knocked on my abusers door...,"Before I knocked on my abusers door I pressed voice record on my phone and put it in my pocket. I thought it would be best that I recorded the whole thing as I really didn’t know how he was going to react when he saw me.

A lot of people have asked me in the past, if I was to ever see him again would I be able to restrain myself, and I always replied by saying that I would be extremely surprised if I didn’t. I don’t feel any need to inflict pain on him, speaking out about what he did and putting it in his face feels just as satisfying for me.

The police seized my phone when they arrested me so I never got the chance to listen back to the recording, but I have been told that it will be used as evidence in the court case that is coming up for it all. I am not sure if they will play it in full or just bring a summary of it, but regardless it will paint a good picture of how the confrontation went. It will show him panicking shouting ‘go away, go away’ whilst I got in his face and asked him questions like,

g4qf6u,"Was I abused, or was I just a bad kid?","Hi everyone. I’m a bit nervous to share this lengthy piece about my life, but I’d appreciate any insight.

I’m a recently married 27F. We have been together for several years and are truly happy. The largest issue in our relationship has been his nMom, who has constantly attempted to disempower us in ways that I won’t elaborate on here. We are no contact with her now, which is incredibly sad, but necessary. 

My husband is the bravest person I know for surviving her abuse. I felt resilient against most of her cruel actions because I loved him so much. But as a true narcissist, she gathered incriminating information to twist when the time was right. 

nMIL had a short lunch with my parents after we‘d been dating for a couple of years. My parents and I are on good terms now. I call them often and try to help them when I can. But I had a troubled relationship with them growing up, and apparently, certain aspects of my childhood were extracted during this brief lunch. When she was in the hospital (she’s ok), she told my husband I was violent and that she knew I was abusing him like I abused my entire family. I know my family said nothing close to this because it’s blatantly false. They probably said something along the lines of “she was difficult growing up” and “she and her sisters fought and someone almost lost an eye.” Regardless, this accusation sent me into a spiral that still shakes me, years later, as I reflect upon the painful childhood that I had suppressed. 

My story (it’s long, sorry!!) —

For context: my dad was ~3 years sober when I was born, and he was only 25 years old. My mom was 22. I was only 10 months old when my first sister was born. My parents were young but came from a conservative background. My dad was the provider, and my mom stayed home, even when we were in school. Spanking was allowed. 

I am the oldest of 3 girls born in under 3 years, which I know was a lot for my parents to handle. None of us was planned, and they were young and newly dating when they got pregnant with me. I exhibited ”giftedness” early (started reading at 3, highly verbal), which was met with tremendous amounts of expectation (she’s a genius, she’s going to Harvard, etc.) (spoiler: I didn’t!)

My earliest memories are of being reprimanded. I vividly recall my youngest sister falling down the stairs when she was ~1 YO, which means I was ~3.5 YO. She was screaming, my parents panicked, and I was blamed. “HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN,” my dad screamed. He held me up and shook me violently. 

My dad thankfully never broke his sobriety, but he had a lot of rage that was mostly taken out on me throughout my childhood. 

I wish I could remember more specifics, but I am certain I’ve blocked them out. I just remember feeling from a very young age that I was not treated fairly. My sisters could do no wrong, and I was considered selfish. I was intellectually ahead of my sisters and didn’t always play with them, especially in our younger years. But no matter who got a booboo or who stole whose toy, I was to blame. 

I remember getting into frequent arguments/debates with my father, especially between ~4-14 years old. I can’t remember what they were about. But they would often escalate to him grabbing me, swiping at me, knocking the wind out of me, slapping me in the face. Picking me up by the jaw and yelling at me, as loudly as possible, with his face beet red with fury. 

Common attacks that have stuck with me:
“You miserable, ungrateful child”
“Shut your face, you little shit”
“Show some fucking respect”
“You think you’ve never made a fucking mistake”
“Selfish little brat”

I don’t want to portray that I was an angel child at home. But I need to say that I was pretty close to an angel child everywhere else. I never had a single behavioral complaint in school, was a straight A/AP student, highly involved in extracurriculars (largely because I never wanted to be home), with great friends. I never did any drugs. I was kind to my teachers, classmates, and everyone in my extended family. I was a high achiever. 

Ever since kindergarten, I’ve always carried a crippling fear of “getting in trouble.” If the teacher asked me something insignificant like to get in line for lunch, I would agonize over it for weeks. I tried to be perfect at school. There, I was the “good girl, no trouble at all.” I was safe. For better or for worse, I feel that same need to please as an adult. 

My mom often said “imagine if your teachers/friends/boyfriend/etc could see the way you really are.” Yeah. I had tantrums at home. Primarily targeted at my dad and often in tandem with his tantrums. I couldn’t tell you who initiated. I occasionally lost my temper with my mom and my sisters. I resented them for being complacent and never backing me - they’d say “i can’t believe i have a daughter/sister who acts like this” - But mostly, I was furious with my dad. I hated him. 

I started telling my dad “I hate you” around age 7 or 8. I yelled it whenever we were in an altercation. It was the only word I knew that could come close to encompassing the neglect I felt and the person who caused it. 

I said it so often because I didn’t just want to hurt him - I needed him to say it back. And one day, he did.

“I HATE YOU TOO YOU LITTLE SHIT”

There it was. He said what I’d already believed to be true. But now I had heard it. Now it was certain. 

I begged my mom to leave him. I would cry and say “how? How can you be with him when he hurts me?” And she would always hug me and say “he’s not perfect, but he’s a good man. You two are just too much alike.” That made me sick. How could I be like a person who I loathed? Who hurt me? I wanted to be the opposite of him in every way. 

I have never been a good sleeper. I’ve suffered horrible nightmares that often wake me up screaming, at least biweekly, since I was 3. Part of me thinks it’s because I used to stay up late and eavesdrop on my parents. After my dad and I had gotten into a fight, I’d hear my parents condemn me. They couldn’t believe they had such a cruel child. But what about his yells, his hits? No. I was to blame. 

When I was 8, my parents made me start going to therapy to talk about my feelings. They said that I was out of control and if I wasn’t careful, I would always be out of control. I knew I was in trouble. I knew I had to go because I was “bad.” Of course my sisters didn’t have to go. Great.

Once a week, I played board games with a psychologist. She asked me lots of questions, and I was very careful and calculated in how I answered. I didn’t trust easily because I knew I was there to be “fixed.” One day, she asked me why I was mad at my father. 

My little smart but naive mind went wild with excitement. I was going to tell her, and then she would take my dad away!!!

I looked at her straight in the eye and said “My dad hits me. He smacks me in the face. He swears at me. He shakes me. He calls me a little shit. He knocks the wind out of me. He never apologizes for it. And he does it a lot.” She looked at me with concern but also suspicion. She said she’d like to bring him into our next session. 

I will never forget when my dad came into the session. He was amazing. It was the most convincing performance I had ever seen.

Psychologist: She tells me you hit her, swear at her, shake her. Is that right?

My dad: Oh my god. Of course not. We love her so much. We just want her to learn how to control her temper and to be less cruel to her sisters.

He left the room. I looked at the psychologist.

Psychologist: Well, he seemed nice. 

That was it. That was my chance. He lied. And he lied MASTERFULLY. She didn’t believe me. My life was over. I needed to grow up and move out as fast as possible. 

This tumultuous relationship continued into my mid-teenage years. He once shoved me out of the passenger’s seat into the snow at age 13. I got back in the car in silence, and he dropped me off at my extracurricular. I was shaken. An older friend of mine comforted me and asked what was wrong. I couldn’t hide it anymore. I told him “I think my dad abuses me. He shoved me out of his car just before I came here. And he hits me when he’s mad at me.” 

He told his high school counselor, who was required to take legal action. But he didn’t tell her my name. I got a little bit excited but mostly scared. My dad would kill me if he knew I revealed this. Then I started thinking... was he really that bad? Or was I really that bad to make him act this way toward me and nobody else? He scarcely hit my sisters and never, to my knowledge, hit my mom. 

I told my mom. She said “you need to tell your friend it’s not true because it’s not true. This could get everyone in big trouble, and it’s not right.”

So I did. My friend didn’t exactly believe me, but he didn’t push it. 

By high school, I was used to hating my dad. I would pack my schedule with activities and sleepovers so I could be home as little as possible.

The hard part was going to relatives’ houses. I became the subject of intervention at my grandparents’ house. They would offer me a gratitude journal because I was causing so much trouble at home. Clearly I was unaware of my blessings. Even they knew how awful I was. They would never believe me if I told them the truth about my dad. They probably think he‘s right to hit me. “But I’m barely home with all my activities,” I’d say. And I’d cry. Because again, I was in trouble, even when I didn’t have time to be in trouble. 

I remember telling my high school boyfriend, who came from a close Italian family, that I couldn’t remember the last time I hugged my dad. He told me that was very sad. Around age 16, when I had this serious boyfriend, my dad started acting better. Less violent. Fewer outbursts.

At the same time, I realized I had proven my family wrong. Somebody loved me. For the first time in my life, I felt happy and loved... not by my family, but by my boyfriend. I didn’t care about or trust my dad’s calmer ways, but I was leaving soon for college anyway. 

I attended an expensive college and was expected to contribute (my sisters, unsurprisingly, were not). I nannied M-F from 6-9am before doing my classes and activities. I paid for all my food and recreation. I’d get a few nice phone calls from my dad and then a few furious ones, where I was berated for spending too much money. “I’m working. I’m trying. I don’t want to spend your money. I don’t want to ask you for anything ever again,” I’d say. 

And since I graduated, I’ve successfully been on my own. I kept my word of not asking them for hardly anything, and I’ve worked my ass off to get here. My parents finally respect me, as my sisters (who were intensely babied) still rely on them for nearly everything. My relationship with my parents is a bit guarded but decent because I’m the one who, ironically, “turned out good.”

My dad hasn’t hit me in many years, which could  be seen as an issue of proximity (we live several hours apart). But I actually do believe he has changed. He’s much gentler, and while he can still lose his temper, he has a much longer fuse. 

Two weeks before my wedding, I was running over logistics with my mom on the phone. I explained that I wanted her and my dad to walk down the aisle ahead of me, and I would walk down the aisle alone. 

My dad already knew this and supported my choice. We had a non-religious and non-traditional ceremony. I told my dad that my choice wasn’t based on our history, as he recently acknowledged and sheepishly apologized for his ”angrier” years. I told him I didn’t like the idea of being a man’s “property” and being “passed/released” from one man to the next. That’s my personal preference, and I respect anyone’s personal choice in that matter. 

My dad agreed with my choice, but my mom was livid. She said I was a difficult child and that I needed to get over whatever anger I‘m still holding against my father from childhood. I explained my stance on the issue, but she couldn’t hear it. She was worried about what people would think if he didn’t walk me down the aisle. So I said it. “Are you afraid they’ll think he abused me?” She lost it. She told me I “egged him on” when I was a kid and made him lose his temper. I was “oppositional and defiant,” and she had tried unsuccessfully to get me diagnosed for ODD. 

I crumbled and hung up. I couldn’t, and am still struggling to process this betrayal. She sent a weak apology text but never owned the damage that this interaction caused me. She was cold and distant to me on my own wedding day, which is not in her nature at all. 

Now that I’m married and am considering starting a family, I’m scared. Was I really abused? Or is it possible that I really was this much of a terror as a toddler/child/adolescent? I’m understanding how much resentment I’ve held against my mom, without me realizing it. After all this time, my dad can at least somewhat acknowledge his wrongdoing. But my mom still blames me. She can’t accept the fact that she didn’t protect me. 

I work in education and childcare. I’ve taught hundreds of kids and nannied/practically raised 5 kids, often spending more time with them than their own parents. I have never hit a kid and can’t even fathom it. I’ve barely even raised my voice. In the rare instance my husband raises his voice at me, I have to take a walk alone and cry. I can’t handle the confrontation. It’s still triggering. 

My parents adopted twin babies last year. My sisters and I are all grown up. These babies could be MY children. My initial feeling was fear and concern. Would these babies endure the same pain I endured? Would they grow to feel loved? Are my parents trying to undo the bad things they did with me? Or maybe they want a shot at raising more “good” children, since I left them with such a bad taste. 

Can abusers change? Was I even abused? Am I really still hiding “my true, cruel self” even though it hasn’t ever manifested outside of my immediate family? Am I really a violent person? Did I deserve it?

g4reo1,"Silence Undone, my short film","Hello everyone!

My name is Linda Jacobsen, 30 years old. I’m an actress and filmmaker.

With an incredible team of international artists, I am making SILENCE UNDONE. This short film is about my experiences with learning to trust and daring to let someone in, after being abused as a child.

When I was nine years old, I was sexually abused by my stepfather for two years. When I turned seventeen, I felt powerful enough to come forward. Therapy helped me to recover from the abuse and for a while I felt free. However, nobody told me that it wasn’t the end of it. 

My ability to trust people was shattered and I still carried with me deeply rooted beliefs about my worthiness. I was trapped within patterns that I initially created to protect myself. I thought that by not showing my vulnerabilities I couldn’t get hurt, but this exact belief kept me from building meaningful connections with others and left me lonely. This started to change when I met a loving man who made me see that opening up could be safe.

A lot of people still feel ashamed about being abused and carry the burden alone. Now that I have found and reclaimed my voice, I want to empower others and show that such traumatic circumstances in the past should not dictate our future. 

SILENCE UNDONE is meant to move people who experienced trauma during their childhood and inspire them. To live for trust and connection, instead of fear and loneliness. Us humans are social beings, and to live fully and be truly happy, establishing a true connection with others is essential. Because together we experience, create, grow and live. Together.

Our film is based on symbolic images and the universal themes of connection and loneliness, which makes it relatable to so many people. I believe this project has the potential to make a positive impact on many lives. 

To make sure the film reaches as many people as possible we are crowdfunding for our distribution. We plan to apply for film festivals as well as directly connect with communities, such as this one, to share my story with. Please watch the pitch video linked below to get a first impression.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this project in the comments below. If you want to help spread the message of our film you can donate at [cinecrowd.com/stilteongedaan](http://cinecrowd.com/stilteongedaan).

g4us8z,Is this abuse and what can I do?,"Okay so this is gonna be long.

I'm 16 and live with my parents and siblings
My family is religious and so am I, I'm just not that much into practising the belief. Anyway, my mom had enrolled me into this religious course thing 2 years ago, I didn't want to go due to my social anxiety and the fact that some people I didn't like and who made me feel anxious around them went there, but since I do not have a relationship with my parents where I would tell them this I just said I didn't wanna go. My mom didn't care and made me go anyway. 

It's been 2 years and I've been going since. I like learning new things and I enjoy learning things in depth but I still dont feel welcome there. 

Anyway so ever since the quarantine happened they give us homework and that on top of all the school I have to do for school was a lot. Yesterday I got really frustrated while making my homework and I was talking and complaining to myself about it. No one of my family took me serious and my mom said I should do it willingly since the thing I was studying is part of the religion. I was upset because no one took me seriously and said that I didn't even want to do this anyway and that she had made me. 

She got angry and said that it was important and it was either this or going to a religious school where you have dorms etc. I replied by saying that forcing me to attend a school like that would only make me resent her and hate the religion, to which she replied by saying that after I got to a certain age it wasn't her responsibility and that if I hated the religion it would be my problem. After she said that I only told her that if it wasn't her responsibility she also didn't have the right to send me there either. After that we didn't really say anything

She's been giving me the silent treatment ever since. She doesn't acknowledge me, answer me when I ask a question or even look at me. The only time she talked to me was to yell at me. 

In the beginning I didn't care that much, I was upset and a bit annoyed bc Imo her reaction is immature. But after her only acknowledgement of my existence was her yelling at me I've been having a harder time dealing with it. I cried and I feel horrible. I don't think I did something wrong, but this is really messing me up emotionally. Whenever I try to talk to her and ask what I did wrong she ignores me. 

Does this count as emotional abuse? What can I do to fix this? It isn't like I'm non-religious, not that that even would be bad, freedom of religion is important, nor is it like I don't care about the course itself. I was just upset, overwhelmed and frustrated but I can't even explain that since she won't listen. 

TLDR, My mom and I got in an argument, she's been giving me the silent treatment ever since and only broke that to yell at me once.

g546ns,My mom hates me and she wants me to die.,"My mom told me she hated me a couple of times. The worst time was when she got so angry she screamed, thrown stuff at me and pulled on her own hair. She said she really really hates me and could not endure me no more. She chased me around that day but i was quicker, scared to death. My mom has always been a strong woman. Even after the rough divorce with my abusive dad, she still took care of us and gave us love. Before i turned 13 i remember things being peaceful, eventhough we went through A LOT. I am 17 now. After the last couple of years she became more hateful and more tired. She is always fighting with me about keeping the house clean and chores. They are not normal fights. It always escalates and it makes me very scared. Im used to her hitting me bc i grew up like that and that is not even the main problem. The things she says keeps me up at night. Things like I hope you die or i wish u would just commit suicide. (I was once very depressed and suicidal but that is another story) Even writing this brings tears to my eyes. I have ADHD and i have always been forgetfull and on the lazy side. Sometimes im hyper and those are the days she hates me the most. So i sometimes think that all this, all her hate and all the pain she has is all my fault. My mom has never been affectionate but it has never been this bad ever. 

The last couple of days she talks about wanting to die and getting a heart attack bc of me someday. And today when we were cleaning the house she said you forgot to take the trash out. I said lets do it tomorrow. She said we may not even be alive then. Or things like this house needs to be ready. And when i say why she just doesnt respond. Im so scared she will actuelly kill herself or die of a heartattack. I am very very scared. Sometimes i am so scared that i wanna jump of the balcony, maybe she would feel less pain.

g549u2,Is this abuse?,"(Sorry about my English!)
My mom (34) has some serious anger issues and a drinking problem. She’s well aware of this and she tries to make up for it most of the time. (She’s a generally nice person when she’s not ‘in a mood’) Ever since my younger brother (5) became a toddler, she’s started to belittle him (Calling him a monkey among other things) and say stuff like “When will you finally become a human being”.
My brother doesn’t like to listen to our parents- and I understand that kids need to be taught not to do that- but sometimes it seems like a bit too much, you know? 
When my mother gets really pissed she screams at my brother, gets a drink, and then storms around the house snarling insults to him. She regularly calls him useless and stupid. 
Recently she got tired of my brother trashing the house and flipped out completely. She started screaming at him every time she found a mess he’d made, and after a few drinks, she threw away a bunch of his toys because he wouldn't clean them up. 
My mom insists that this isn’t abuse, that she’s known “real” abuse and this isn’t much in comparison. I’m not so sure anymore.

g5cj6h,"My best friend (21f) took her rapist (21m) to court, but he wasn’t charged. Now I’m kind of glad I (22f) didn’t take my abuser (29m) to court, and that isn’t right.","In high school about 5 years ago, I went to babysit my best friend and her boyfriend while they got drunk. We agreed beforehand that they wouldn’t have sex while drunk, for whatever reason. I went to find them and he was on top of her, she wasn’t moving. We left, for other reasons, and that was the end of it for a while. She opened up to me several months later that she didn’t consent to it. It wasn’t until 2 years ago that she filed a police report. The process took forever, but then last year around this time they had me testify in court. 

I found out this morning what happened. The judge said he “unequivocally believed” that my best friend was raped. BUT apparently in her blackout drunken state, she “arched her back” which could have been taken as consent by her ex. He was not charged. 

I’m furious with the system. It’s shit that you’d think they lean more towards the female victim’s side, but I guess you can’t rely on that. The whole time this has gone on, I thought about my abuser. 

Not long after the actual event happened, I was with my on-again-off-again friend/kind of boyfriend but not. He emotionally abused me, played games, was hot and cold all the time because he loved me but didn’t like me physically. I was dating someone else at the time, so at this point we were just hanging out as friends. Throughout the night, he tried touching my chest. Near the end, he forcefully groped me after I told him to stop several times. I kind of wanted to be with him, but I wasn’t a cheater, and I had not given consent. I knew he was just jealous whenever I was not available. He held me down and said “I love when you say no.”

I got angry and finally left. He followed me out to the car and grabbed my car door before it closed. He told me I couldn’t “leave angry.” I hit my wallet against his crotch to get him to lean over so I could leave. He didn’t. He stayed standing. He grabbed my arm and said “you hurt it, now you have to make it feel good.”

To this day I don’t know how exactly I got away. I was also an idiot. I called him on my way him and apologized for leaving. The next day I told my boyfriend at the time. My abuser didn’t like that. He cut me off and said basically that I shouldn’t have made him feel like he did anything wrong and he couldn’t be around me anymore. We did eventually get back in touch and made some kind of peace. I cut things off for food exactly 4 years ago this week. 

I’m plagued by this. I’m not sure if I miss him, if I regret not reporting him, if I regret not giving in, I’m not sure. Now after knowing what my best friend went through with court, I’m kind of glad I didn’t put myself through the pain. I wanted it until it turned bad, so that would have been taken as consent I’m sure. 

Anyway, I’m not sure what I want from this. 

Tl;dr: my best friend’s rapist wasn’t charged, and it made me not want to report my abuser. I’m sad.",hotelbooks33433,2020-04-21 03:06:21,6,597,11.83,19.66,88.29,12.46,12.98,12.56,93.47,60.3,26.97,20.44,11.73,0.67,0.84,6.37,0.84,6.53,3.18,11.89,9.38,4.19,7.04,5.03,19.93,4.52,2.68,1.34,0.5,1.01,7.71,3.35,4.36,0,2.51,0.84,13.23,0,1.51,2.01,5.03,14.57,2.01,1.51,2.68,2.18,1.34,6.2,2.51,0,0.84,1.68,2.85,0.67,0.5,0.67,0.67,8.21,2.85,1.34,2.68,2.68,0.5,11.56,6.7,0.34,17.25,2.35,7.04,8.38,0.84,1.01,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.67,0.34,0,0,0,0.17,21.78,7.71,4.52,0.17,0.17,0,0,0.5,1.68,5.53,1.34,0.17

Ok so basically I’m almost 18 now but I have anorexia, and i started recovering and regularly attending meetings at an ED unit at 16. This unit is really quite small and i was assigned a male doctor who is also a trained CBT therapist so he acted as that aswell. And i dont really know how to explain this but basically i was at the lowest point of my life so far and i would break down crying and stuff. And he would without asking for permission come and hug me (bear in mind i didnt know this man when this started) or hold me even during the first ever sessions and he would do stuff that made me really uncomfortable even though i said i didnt want to. And i was so upset during these sessions that i didnt even recognize what he was doing, it was just afterwards that i felt ...icky. And i felt like it wasnt anything bad bc sometimes there were women unit workers at the meetings aswell and they just stared and smiled as he was doing these things. But the thing is i feel like this isnt bad bc i did like going there for a while bc ive been neglected and also he diagnosed me and made me feel sick enough, so my parents are under this impression that i like going there and that i need this doctor to recover, but they dont know about the bad stuff bc im so ashamed. I don’t know what to call the stuff that happened and i dont wanna give details bc it causes great discomfort. I just know that i feel unsafe, nauseous and start crying as soon as my parents bring up me starting to see him again (my treatment was stopped for a while due to relapse but now they want me to start again).

g5id4o,HOW TO DEAL WITH A PSYCHOPATH? HELP PLEASE.,"Long story short, the psychopath is my dad. 
Now, he seems like the perfect human being when he is sober. The problem rises when he's drunk (or so as he acts). He is an abusive, manipulative, violent, psychotic man when drunk. A caring, loving father when sober. How? 
He slut shames my mother, me and my sister where as we've never done anything ""slutty"". Mom can't get a divorce because he will NEVER leave my mom. Love as he says but the death threats shows otherwise. We can't run away because then he'll shift the torture to my mom's siblings, whom he actually hates i guess.
I can't use any of the "" Legal"" procedures because I live in a society where I'll be tagged as the girl who put her good father in jail. And tbh, i don't want him in a jail. I love him. But nowadays , i hate him much more. He works hard for us but when the night falls and he starts drinking his evil alter ego springs up to life. Once the sun rises and he's sober, we don't talk anything about what happened the night before because he'll get angry and the whole day will be a disaster. He needs a therapist because he has a lot of pent up emotions, since his childhood. His dad had been the exact person as he is today. 

What should I do? 
I'm clueless and trapped.
He needs to heal but i feel like I might just not be able to survive through it all.

g5il4r,Help Needed...,"I’m 18 years old and 4 months away from college. My parents know I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 4 months and refused to let me be on dates with him. I constantly told them that I’m 18 and responsible, which I have proven on countless occasions, but they kept claiming he could be a sex trafficker (he’s not). I kept asking them to meet him and my mother kept refusing, saying there was no reason for her to meet him.

My boyfriend is in the army, and eventually got the news that he’s going to be deployed on May 30th. We hadn’t been seeing each other much, and I begged my mother to let me see him before he leaves, and she once again refused. I was desperate to see him a couple times before he left, so I decided to sneak him in. My parents are known for being irrational, abusive, and intrusive, so we decided it was best not to tell them. 

The first time he came over we didn’t get caught. We cuddled for a couple hours, talked about our feelings, then he left. This happened a few more times.The last time he came over, with intention to leave, but ended up falling asleep and accidentally spending the night. When he left in the morning, a neighbor saw him leaving, and knowing he was my boyfriend, called my parents stating the “house was being robbed.” He later confessed he knew it was my boyfriend because his wife saw me help him out of the room.

My dad is more understanding about the situation, and agrees that my mother puts too many restrictions on me. I’m not allowed to go out with friends, or go to friends’ houses. I’m not allowed to have very much social media, and my location is constantly tracked. My messages are synced to her iPad, and she listens in to my phone calls. She constantly checks my school email. I once told her I got my own email account, but she forced me to give her the password and changed it, causing me to lose access to the account. I ended up getting Skype and Instagram with a burner email, where I communicated with my friends and boyfriend. She would get mad about me calling or texting him once a day, saying I need to “focus on my studies,” even though I’m an A student and our classes are over due to Corona.

My mom keeps coming into my room and screaming that I broke her trust and that my boyfriend is a piece of sh\*t and that I’m stupid. I apologized multiple times and showed her my point of view, stating that I was feeling helpless but understood what I did was wrong, but she won’t listen. She comes into my room every hour screaming that I’m a terrible child who doesn’t know right for wrong. She beat me badly for it as well, and when I held up my arms in self defense she claimed I was hitting her back.

I can’t move out because I wasn’t allowed to get a steady job, and any money that I earn was taken from me. When I asked for it back to buy a prom dress, they stated that it had been used on my food and electricity. I had never once been asked to pay for those, and I had been told the money was going into my savings account, which I’m pretty sure doesn’t exist now. 

I understand what I did was wrong but I feel like my mother is dramatizing the situation. I never left the house, so I wasn’t in an unsafe situation. I just spent time with my boyfriend, who I really like. A lot of teens are sneaking out/sneaking people in during this day and age, especially ones with parents like mine. I talked to my friends about situations like this, and their parents agreed they felt like my parents are controlling and are overreacting. Are they overreacting? What should I do? 

I'm constantly being abused right now verbally and physically. I'm being scratched, hit, kicked, called ""desperate"" and ""whore"" and ""embarrassment to the family"" among other things. I'm being woken up at night beaten, in the day my mother is spitting on me and hitting me and scratching me and pulling my hair until my neck audibly cracks. Every time I apologize my parents completely disregard it as well as my point of view. The only option for me to get out of here is to move in with my boyfriend, which he's completely on board with. I don't know if I should move in with him, but I know if I stay here my mother will end up killing me in a fit of rage. There have been times she almost has. I don't care that they'll pay for my college, I can't keep on living like this. What should I do?",yagirldebbie,2020-04-21 09:37:56,17,833,24.76,45.69,85.59,6.06,18.51,14.41,93.76,60.02,23.53,19.33,12.61,0.72,0,4.92,1.08,4.2,3.96,13.33,10.2,4.8,7.08,2.16,21.13,2.04,1.8,1.56,1.08,1.8,3.96,1.08,2.88,0.48,0.84,0.36,15.97,2.04,1.56,3,3.96,9,2.28,1.44,1.08,1.2,1.08,2.88,2.64,0.96,0.96,0.72,1.08,0.48,0.24,0.24,0.12,10.08,4.68,0.72,3.48,1.32,0.84,8.4,9.48,1.08,15.61,2.4,6.96,6.6,1.32,0.48,0.96,1.32,0.12,0.12,0.36,0.12,0,0,0.24,0,16.21,5.4,5.28,0,0,0.36,0,0,1.2,3.36,0.24,0.36

g5jul7,I think my dad sexually molested me and my sister and I just realized,When we were young my dad weirdly liked us being near him and labeling us as his property. We were emotionally/mentally abused a lot by him but he did use to have a weird habit when we were little to pitch our ass and do a weird smile at us. After I went in to puberty it stopped and I mostly forgot about it because remembering about it I felt super uncomfortable and lately I have been remembering and feeling even more uncomfortable around him. I cringe when he touches my shoulder I hate even him being in the room with me but lately remembering what he use to do when I was younger I just realized it may have been some sexual abuse. I don’t know how to feel or what to even consider it if it was just him weirdly not knowing how to be affectionate towards kids.

g5mn72,I just want to talk about it,"I crouched behind the doorway, watching from the other room with tear-staind cheeks, my breath like a weak stutter.  Before me, my parents argued without stop, as suddenly my mom threatened to leave him. 

For a moment it went quite.  In my naivety, I entered the room, hoping to pacify the situation, to understand what was happening.

Yet, it was the worst decision I could've made, as I witnessed my father's anger grow, I instinctively knew I had to escape.

I ran as fast as I could to my room, trying to switch the lock and hold shut my door.  However, my ex-military father's adrenaline disorder had shown it's full potential as he pushed in the door, throwing my weak four year-old body to the wall.

I knew my mother could hear through those paper-thin walls.  I knew she heard as he beat me black and blue leaving hand-shaped welts from my legs to my back, I knew she heard as I cried and screamed in agony, I knew she heard it, but she did nothing.

After what felt like a life time, it was over, and he stormed into his room as a somber chill covered my body.

I ran to my mom and hugged her tight, latching on like a parasite, I refused to let go.  I couldn't breathe as she tried to comfort me, my sobbing had turned to full-on ugly crying and I felt so pathetic and alone.

I asked, ""does daddy not love me?"" 

She replied, ""yes he does""

""Then why would he hurt me? You don't hurt the people you love...""

Then she just had to say it

""Look at me, what he did wasn't right but I went through worse and I got through it.  You just need to deal with it.""

My mom threatens to have me arrested. It's happened a couple times because police don't listen to children/teens with noted depression. I would go to jail with bruises and several sprains because I had to get her off of me.

My mother threatens to send me to the mental hospital. She says stuff like ""I'll make sure they have a reason to take you."" When I was in the mental hospital, they did nothing to help me. They made it worse. They did the same thing my mother did, scream at me and call me a 'fucking liar' and 'useless'. 

She slaps me constantly. When I try to get away from her, she slaps every part of my body that she can reach.

I have tons of posters and flags in my room. She rips them off the wall and specifically rips my signed posters and albums. She isn't good to be around.

My cat isn't safe either. He doesn't like her and I understand why. She says he is problematic and that he triggers her. She had said ""I'm so close to giving him away"" and ""instead of giving him away, I'll just throw him outside.""

She claims I fake my injuries and that I'm a 'lazy fuck who does nothing to help around the house' when, in reality, I do all of the house work. ""House work comes before school work."" If I don't clean her mess, she belittles me until I do it. If I leave a little mess, she says ""I'm always the one cleaning up your messes!""

g5ox6i,Am I an abusive sibling? I feel so guilty,"I have 2 brothers, and I’m the middle child (I’m 18 now tho). Growing up, I was a violent kid. I was constantly getting into fights with other kids. My older brother and I fought constantly, and it got physical. I fought with my younger brother too, but more with my older brother. Things also got physical between us, and I feel so horrible for all of it. Especially because my younger brother is about 6 years younger than me. Basically, we grew up hating each other’s guts. I always thought it was the typical, “Siblings fight constantly, but once they grow up, they love each other to death” shit that our society teaches us. 

My brothers and I get along now. We argue every now and then, but otherwise, I think we have a good relationship. However, there are times in the past few years where I got physical with my older brother. I threatened to slap him when I was 16 because I didn’t think he was respecting my boundaries. I can’t remember exactly why I threatened to do that tho, so I could be wrong. I actually punched him when I was 16 because it felt like he was trying to get under my skin. He kept laughing at me when I was reacting with anger. A few months after that, he either pushed me or hit me, so I hit him back. When I was 17, I threatened to punch him because he kept interrupting me in an argument and it felt like I couldn’t say anything because he kept talking over me. I’m not saying that my reasons excuse my behavior. What I did was wrong, and I feel bad for what I did. 

We all had a fucked up childhood, and I’m not saying that excuses what I did either, but I feel like it’s a reason. I thought it was normal for siblings to fight constantly. My father physically abused me up until I was 13, and he’s still emotionally abusive and neglectful. I spent a lot of my childhood locking myself in the bathroom from him to avoid being hit, slapped, whipped with a belt, beaten, etc. My mother is also emotionally abusive and neglectful. There were times where she got physical too, but that was mostly my dad.

g5pel3,Is This Abuse?,"I'm posting this to a couple different sub reddits.

I'm 16 (F), almost 17, and I've been having some realizations about my family's dynamic in the past month or so. I'm fairly sure that my dad, and possibly my mom, are emotionally abusive. This focuses primarily on my dad.

When I was younger, like before I started school, my dad began to impress upon me that I was selfish and too sensitive. I'm sure he was right about both, but he implied that it made me weak, and that I wasn't good enough. One of my earliest memories is of him telling me ""Everything is always about you, how to make you feel better, never about how to make me, or mom, or Nick (my older brother, I changed his name) feel better."" Things along those lines continued for years, when he would occasionally flat out call me a nuisance and insist that everything was my fault and that it was my behavior that needs to change. I've been going to therapy for about 8 months now for depression and anxiety, and I've come to the difficult conclusion that it's not my fault, and that I was never acting in a way that wasn't ""normal"" for a kid who tends to be a little more anxious and sensitive.

My dad also went through a sailing phase (mid-life crisis), which terrified everyone else in the family. That didn't stop him from essentially forcing my family to go on often weekend long trips on the Great Lakes on a 20 ft sailboat. He continued to have a sort of wanderlust phase which led to my family taking a year to travel (when I was in 7th grade), which for the most part was just extremely stressful for me.

I am also strongly discouraged from keeping money in the house or spending money. We essentially have an IOU spreadsheet in Google docs to keep track of what my parents owe me. However, I can't always get money back out of that ""bank"", and money is often borrowed from me and is never given back. I only clothes that I am allowed to buy new are underwear, bras, and swim suits, even those have to be inexpensive. I'm also generally discouraged from using electricity for ""luxury,"" such as using a small space heater in my room during winter when I'm studying, or using said heater in my bathroom while I'm showering. Now I'm fully aware that my family is well off. My dad has bought numerous solar panels (I suppose they're a good long term investment), we had 3 sailboats, 2 canoes, and a travel trailer, and we were able travel for a year with no income, and my dad was able to retire at 48. Overall, he's always make me feel as though my needs should always be put behind others, especially his, and I've slowly come to the realization that he doesn't want me and probably doesn't love me. Everything listed here has resulted in fights, mostly ones in which I end up crying, and he ends of being angry with me.

My dad retired early a little over a year ago, which has made things significantly worse, as he's home all the time now. I'm now tense pretty much all the time when I'm home, and I immediately panic when I can tell that his footsteps are a little angrier than usual.

In addition to all of this, I have some things that I'm not entirely sure about. I don't know if they fall under the category of emotional abuse, sexual abuse, or something else.

I'm not allowed to have a lock on my bedroom door, and I was not allowed to lock the bathroom door for years, but it hasn't been discussed in a long time, and I've recently started locking it when I'm changing, showering, etc. My dad would often decide that he couldn't wait the five minutes for me to finish whatever I was doing and maybe get some clothes on, and would insist on opening the door to get something, usually like nail clippers or something. He also spent a fair amount of time this summer working on his laptop sitting on our front porch, directly outside my bathroom window, so he could see in if he wanted to. I do not have frosted glass, only a curtain that is somewhat sheer. He continued to sit there all summer, and through fall, despite me asking both my parents multiple times to not have him sit there, or just move the chair to the other side of the porch. This resulted in a lot of fights, none of which did anything for me.

I've also never been allowed to pull away from hugs from him, and I used to deal with a fair amount of what I can only call ""forced cuddling."" He also phrases this fairly strangely and sexually at times, and any time that we spend alone together working on something or doing something like going for a bike ride is referred to by him as a ""date.""

I really don't know what any of this means, or how to cope with it, so if you have any insight or advice, please comment. Thank you, and I'm incredibly sorry for how long this turned out to be, and I'm sorry if my train of thought is all over the place, but I don't have it in me to read through it again. Please also let me know if I'm simply being over dramatic, because I really don't know.

g5r9yl,Just read please,"Do you think it's messed up if someone bends over intentionally in front of their younger sibling? Them thinking that they're attracting them? Younger sibling doesn't want it to happen, older sibling does it anyways and did other stuff too. If so what is that, is it abuse?

They know what they're doing, we're both teenagers, same gender.

I really have been bottling this up and just feeling unsafe all the time. My older sibling has been doing this to me a lot, I find it disgusting and it reminds me of what my grandma used to do to me when I was young. I've been abused by others (family included), and I feel like crying, and am scared and just don't want to be here when it happens. I know this isn't directly physical (it was before). What's even more messed up is how they try and say to act like I'm the creep when they do disgusting things to me, all because they lie. They're manipulative like that.

One time I remember we were out in a store and they were arguing with me, I was upset and gonna say something when they turned away, I thought they'd turn back around but that creep bent over in front of me, pretending to adjust the basket. I honestly didn't think they'd do that so I waited to say something back to them but ended up walking away because they wouldn't stop. It was disgusting. A lady saw and laughed at me like 'oh? Wow.', as though I was staring because I wanted to. Not because they're messed up. That creep ran up to me and said 'why'd you walk away?' With a gross smile. My older sibling loves attention, but doesn't get it in that way, she always tries for it though.

I know they're doing it on purpose, they smirk before they do it, look back everytime thinking I am watching, and go wherever I am. Whenever they can, they do it. And they've done other messed up shit before too, one time I asked them to move out of my way, or put a box away for me because they were right where I had to place it. They didn't move and said they wouldn't put it away, when I had to lean over, I looked and they were smirking at me, looking all over my body. I walked away quickly and sat on my bed behind the divider (we shared a room for a bit), and I heard them breathing heavy and weird for a while, they wouldn't tell me when I asked what they were doing. People have done that in front of me before. I felt so disgusted and unsafe by them. I knew what they were doing. Starts with 'm'.

I don't know how to make them stop, I haven't directly told them to stop, only messaged once 'creeps who bend over in front of me are disgusting and awful people', they thought it was a teacher (because they were sick men), shit happened to me at school a lot amongst all the other things.

Honestly I just really needed to vent this, I don't ever speak about what happens to me in this sense. And my older sibling did stuff to me and our other sibling when we were kids. I'm not gonna say what happened with that, so much was started because of that resurfacing. But I really don't feel safe around them, they're manipulative and a liar, and what they do to me is messed up. I just wish I could feel safe somewhere. And yeah I know that talking about it would help but I don't know how, or to who. That creep always acts like it doesn't happen, and tries to get close to me to do it again when I have to act like I enjoy their company when all I've been trying to do is keep my distance.

Enough things like that have happened to me, and I just want it to stop. They are really manipulative and lie all the time, they don't treat me right and blame things they do on me.

Could you please give me advice on what to do? If not, thanks if you've read this far, this has been going on for so long and I needed to get it out.",isayohwellandcry,2020-04-21 17:33:48,2,734,7.61,40.31,95.52,14.48,17.48,10.76,96.19,67.03,25.61,16.21,9.67,0.68,0.54,0.14,5.18,9.26,2.32,14.31,13.08,6.68,9.67,2.59,25.07,3.68,2.72,3.81,0.41,1.63,4.9,2.04,2.86,0.27,0.95,0.14,12.94,1.23,0,0.41,0.14,14.17,3.13,2.45,2.32,1.91,1.63,4.09,3,0.82,1.23,0.82,0.95,0.54,0.27,0,0,6.95,2.32,0.68,2.59,0.41,1.09,7.9,13.22,0.54,16.76,2.04,9.13,6.13,0.68,0.14,0.41,0.14,0,0,0.95,0.27,0.27,0.14,0.14,0.14,17.85,4.9,5.31,0,0,0.82,0,0,0,5.72,1.09,0

g5up6j,Child sexual abuse?,"Hi whoever is reading this. I have something to spill and I've seen a few posts that relate to this website so I made an account just for this purpose. I think I was a victim of child on child sexual abuse and i have no one that I'm comfortable enough with to tell for now. I dont remember how old I was but it was younger than 10 yrs. Id also like to say that I'm an only child, and my parents went through a really rough divorce around age 5. I ended up living permanently with my dad, and got to spend summers with my mom. I had an older family friend  (she was about 2 years older than me and her dad was my dads barber)and she used to come over every sunday and sometimes she initiated that we make out (it was disguised as playing house and we were both the parents) and it'd only happen when we knew our parents wouldnt come in as they were busy. I had no idea what that was but it felt cool, and I had found myself WANTING to do these things. Our friendship continued, since our parents were still friends and we never spoke about it, even to this day. (Also, these memories are not in order at all so bear with me.) Shortly after, one summer I went to spend with my mom, she had moved to Maryland and lived with her friend (who also had 2 kids, 1 was around my age but a little older, and the other one was 4-5 years older) there was one day I was in the shower, and the youngest one (we'll call her T) came into the shower and we also started to kiss and other things. That time I for sure knew it was wrong and i remember feeling very uncomfortable. I didnt want to be doing that. I had gone to their place a couple of summers after that and T nor I never brought it up again. Other instances include my friends back at my dads place where I initiated it, but had no idea what I was doing, as it was something I had learned from these people. At around 10 years old my dad got a promotion and we moved away, I started becoming a teenager and I liked boys but never formed relationships with them like that. Even to this day, I'm 20 years old and still have trouble with forming romantic relationships with men. Im not sure if what I experienced in the past is hindering that, but this has been a realization that I've made over the past few days. Its something that I thought about every few years but never sounded any alarms because I wasnt mentally aware nor could I begin to understand what it was. Abuse is the last thing I would've registered it as, if anything it just had me questioning my sexuality. But this quarantine has really made me think and learn about myself, and I've learned that I tend to suppress traumatic memories (due to not knowing how to process them.) What should I do? My family is very very strict, we're from africa so I find it hard to bring up the subject of mental health and therapy at all, they might laugh in my face lmao. I guess what I'm asking is how to heal? And anyone that has suffered from child on child sexual abuse, how did you over come it? I dont keep in contact with any of the girls that I've had these kind of relations with, I always thought it was a subconscious thing.",24ati25,2020-04-21 21:34:13,2,619,12.83,34.3,95.49,25.77,22.93,13.09,95.15,62.68,23.91,13.89,10.02,1.78,0.16,1.13,0.81,10.02,3.55,13.09,11.31,6.79,8.72,2.75,21.16,4.04,2.58,2.26,2.26,1.78,3.55,1.78,1.78,0.32,0.65,0.16,10.82,2.26,0.81,1.62,1.13,15.02,4.36,2.26,1.29,2.26,1.78,3.88,1.78,0.16,0.65,0.81,1.62,0.16,0.81,0.65,0,8.89,4.36,0.65,2.91,0.48,0.81,10.34,8.08,0.32,15.35,1.78,5.01,8.56,0.97,0.48,0.81,0.48,0,0,0.32,0.16,0.16,0.16,0,0,11.95,3.72,3.55,0,0,0.65,0,0.16,0,1.94,1.94,0
g5vt8x,Sexual abuse?,"So I’ve asked this in a lot of places, but this is the only thing I have found to stop the doubt and shame from becoming overwhelming.

Ok so one of my biggest problems is the doubt I have about the abuse. I don’t know if what happened constitutes assault and I have been having doubts about it. So I am asking for the opinion of people on this subreddit because it just is really bothering me.

So when I was 12(Male) I was at my uncles cottage and I was in the lake with the neighbour’s kid who was ~3-4 years older than me I think, and we were play fighting kind of. He brought us to a place in the lake that was covered by trees so no one could see us, and he pulled me towards him and wrapped his legs around mine and held them closed. He was holding my wrists before he reached down and started touching/grabbing me through my swim trunks which were just soccer shorts. I don’t know how many times he touched me, it may have only been once I don’t remember. I was trying to escape and I was saying stop. It didn’t last very long I don’t think and he didn’t really do anything but touch and grab me. Does that count as sexual assault? I don’t know anymore. It’s just really overwhelming. I hate feeling the doubt along with the pain.

g5wc63,I need to know if this is abuse and if I should leave my husband. I’m 7 months pregnant.,"Me and my husband have been married for a year but we’ve been together for 3 years, when we were dating we had on and off relationship because I didn’t know if I could trust him. I moved in with him and his family the day after my 18th birthday, in the first few months he kept saying stuff like “you’re fat” or things like “I’m gonna hurt you” but they would always end in “I’m just joking, can’t you take a joke? I’ve said that to my exes and they would jokingly say stuff like that back” he always makes me get stuff for him like food and clean the house because I’m his wife and that’s what I’m supposed to do and he works from 5 am to 3:30 pm, anyways I ended up cheating on him and I told him because felt very bad and got really mad and he would talk to multiple girls like a lot so I cheated on him again because he did the same to me. I deserved it I’m not going to lie but then things escalated by him calling me dumb, a hoe and shit head every time he would get mad at me, he would yell at me if I was doing something and if I wasn’t going the speed he wants me to because I tend to take my time and he barely listens to me. He also yells at me to shut up and stop being a crybaby when I cry and never comforts me. Whenever I would leave him he would say “I’m going to kill my self” and “you’re so dumb”. This causes me a lot of stress and some of this is my fault and today I’ve had enough because we were yelling at each other because I was putting away clothes and I wanted to take a break and eat and he yelled at and he took mini pliers and he held them very very closely to my cheek but he didn’t do anything but he made me cry and the usual he would tell me to shut up, he told me he was sorry and the way he likes to resolve conflict is sex. He tried having sex with me but I just sat there upset. Thank you for anyone who took their time to read this it means a ton to me. Should I leave him? If so what should I do because he’s made threats to saying he’d take our baby away from me and I’m scared.",peachytimes12,2020-04-21 23:52:41,10,447,6.6,50.89,35.63,1,34.38,8.28,96.42,66.44,27.52,22.82,12.08,1.12,1.12,7.61,0.89,4.7,3.36,11.86,11.63,4.25,12.53,1.34,24.16,2.91,1.57,1.34,1.34,1.79,6.71,1.57,5.15,0.89,3.13,0.89,16.78,1.57,0,0.45,8.05,14.32,1.12,2.68,4.7,3.36,0.89,4.47,2.68,0,2.24,0.45,2.24,1.12,0.45,0.67,0.67,8.05,2.91,1.34,0.89,2.01,1.12,7.16,11.63,1.34,13.42,2.01,5.15,6.26,0.45,0.67,0.45,0,0,0.22,1.34,0.89,0.22,0,0,0.22,11.41,2.46,1.57,0.22,0,0.45,0,0,2.24,4.47,0,0
g5wcty,First Physically Violent Act,"I've been seeing this guy since January, who to be honest never really treated me with respect. Regardless he was really good in bed and I figured we could just do the friends with benefits thing, the feeling seemed mutual. 

Fast forward to last weekend, he comes over, we fuck then chill for a short time He was eyeing up one of my tobacco pipes (I've collected many over the years). I didn't mind, told him he could have it. He was really happy about it, said he was excited about it for multiple reasons, said thanks and I gave him a hug. He reached down and kissed me then shoved me hard back onto my couch, gathered his things and left. 

I'm just left feeling confused, ashamed, like a fool. 

Tonight someone rang my apartment buzzer, tried to open the door a few times and rang it again, holding down the buzzer for a while. He's never showed up unannounced but I was so scared it was him, he knows my work schedule and it was almost midnight, not like a lot of people going around ringing doorbells this late. I live in a sketchy area, but usually when someone starts pressing buttons to get in they press all of the apartment buttons and yell to be let in. This felt targeted.

g5xagl,So I had a flashback.,"I had a major meltdown and I dont know how to process it. My ex use to choke me. And threaten me. Saying one day hed kill me and that as long  as I did what he said I would last another day. That I was lucky he even paid attention to me.


I dont know what triggered it. I was having a panic attack and then suddenly it was like I was back there. He was telling me dont talk about it or he would be angry and he'd get mad and then i would benin trouble and be punished.



I dont rememeber my partner coming in the room or holding me. I kept repeating dont say  anything dont get in trouble. I dont remember that.


My partner said he'd run me a bath. I agreed. I remember 
sitting up and him trying to hold me and i freaked out and screamed.


What is wrong with me? Its been almost 8 years. My partner would never ever hurt me. I told my therapist and we talked about it but i think I need more than hes giving me but I cant afford it. I am going to see my gp soon and see what my options are.


But I'm scared, what if this happens in public, or when I'm alone, i cant help myself if I black out or whatever the hell it was. Im training my dog to be an assistance dog for anxiety and depression. But like how do i train against this?

g5yehw,"Is this normal? (In desperate need of advice and sorry, this is very long.)","Sorry for this post, it is very long and emotional for me to write. If you read all of it, thank you so much and here’s what’s going on:

Almost everyday (especially during this quarantine), my dad has been 'helping' me with maths and science after school. I’d have about 2 hours break after online school before I’m forced to do maths and science again; this in itself I’m okay with. I’m not too bad at maths and science, but I appreciate ways that I can get better. Anyways, what I’m not okay with is what happens during these helping sessions.

When I have to ask a question or I don’t understand something. Dad will explain in this angry tone, which sets off a lot of unwanted memories of other things for me (I’ve dealt with bullies who were like this at my old school, dad knows that). I get nervous, I don’t focus and I end up being slightly disoriented and not understanding what he said. When I try and ask again, he starts calling me names (like stupid, he starts screaming and saying ‘what’s wrong with you?!’ And ‘don’t try me’).

This only makes me even more nervous and I continue to mess up. I get even more confused and disoriented, which makes it harder to push through and work. When it gets to the third time of me trying to answer a question, dad gets furious and usually either A. knocks on my head (like how you’d knock a door. Not too hard, but it still hurts) or B. he’d shout even louder and leave me feeling really upset and hurt. Once study is over, I usually cry in room and try breathing and grounding techniques so I can calm down.

I really enjoy science. I want to do it as a future career; but I’m starting to have so many bad memories attached to it. It’s like the sadness and the words are clinging to something I love so much. It makes me feel miserable. Instead feeling joy and excitement when it's science class at school, or when I'm trying to read a book about biology, I get nervous as if dad is there, insulting me at the smallest mistakes.

If I make small mistakes, like putting something in the wrong place or eating too much I get teased, yelled at and made fun of. Eating seems to be problem too for some reason, every time he catches me eating a slight bit too much, (or even a normal amount for a growing teen), he'll say things like ""What about the other people in this house? That's too much! Jeez, that could feed \*certain amount of people\*, etc""

Study time is usually the main time for dad to yell, but there’s other times too. A particular time I can remember is when mum was working and we were going to church. He wanted me to wear a dress (he constantly chooses my outfits) and I said it doesn’t fit. I also didn’t want to wear it; I’m a teenager, I can chose what I can wear. So of course, he started shouting at me. This time I stood up for myself and shouted back. Long story short, he ended up locking me in his room for a few hours. It’s very hard to remember how long, but eventually I sneaked out and went into the kitchen. I don’t know what I was thinking but I grabbed the knife.

I sat on a stool outside and cut my leg. I know, it’s stupid that I did it but I did it and I started crying and dad came outside. All I can remember is him smirking and asking me why I did it. I don’t remember what I said, but after that he called me a criminal, took my devices and put me in his room again. I stayed there from morning to night while he kept taunting me, saying things like ‘you’re a criminal, you shouldn’t be hanging around knifes, do you wanna go to jail? Do you wanna kill people?Etc’

There’s a plethora of other times where things like this had happened. I ended up reaching a point where I couldn’t take it and I ended up talking to my mum about dad and some other stuff that had been bothering me. She said she’d talk to dad. When she brought it up, we were all sitting in the living room. She lightly touched on tough discipline and all that, but dad shut her down. He said ‘it doesn’t really hurt the child. As long as I’m not cursing her then it’s not really doing anything. This is discipline; the bible says you should discipline your kids’

Mum nodded and basically started saying I should toughen and up and all that. Dad isn’t always like that, though. Sometimes he’s nice and he jokes around; it confuses me really. How can someone be so happy for one minute and go nuts the next?

I won’t say anymore so this post won’t be so long but Is this abusive behaviour or am I just overreacting?

g5zrpb,-I survived 6 years of childhood sexual abuse-,"This is going to be a graphic one!

I was 7 when it first happened. My new stepdad had moved in after my alcoholic dad had left. He was okay at first, but then he took a sudden turn.

He forced me into my moms room, when no one was around. The dog was barking behind the door, knowing that he was about to do something horrifying to me. I tried to leave, but he yanked me back. He pushed me on the floor pacifically on my knees. I tried to stand up, but the more I tried the more pressure he put on my head. 

He started to touch me while I was down there. I was paralyzed by confusion and fear. I tried to get away my second time and dragged back into the place. I was lucky to not get a carpet rash. Then he started to explain things infront of the door. I remember his threat so vividly. ""This is our secret, if anyone ever knows about this your body is gonna be destroyed in a way you can't even imagine!"",  he said. He clearly knew how scared i was. 

Next thing I knew was that he put me on the bed. I tried to get away my third time. Like they say in here I thought that the third is my chance, but he put his arm around my upper body with pressure so i didn't have space to move. More I tried the more pressure there was. I felt like i'm gonna become blue in any moment. I tried to scream my way out of it then and tried to beg him to stop. He just shushed me and said that I can struggle as long as I want, but I can't get away from him even I wanted, his toys don't have a word or worth and i was gonna be there as long as he ever pleased.

He took his hand off from my mouth and gave me a slap to my shoulder. It hurt badly. It was his way to say that i act normally bad of as I say or else I suffer even more. That happened multiple times, but always to a different part of my body. Even though I quietly cried every single time. I felt dirty and always after the abuse I went into my room just to sob in peace. 

When I was 8, I reported to my mom that there's a strange man at my room in night time. My big brother begun to guard my room. It was him. He came to my room at night just to sit on my carpet looking while i was sleeping.

I sometimes even had small bruises just because of his actions. If mom asked about them I needed to lie, because he was there and I even could see his threat just the way he looked at me. I needed to lie that they were there because I played outside and something happened. 

My puderty began when I was 10. Everything was new and I was even more confused. My new features made it even worse. I knew that it was too early. Bleeding or not, he didn't just care. I blamed myself and my body. I thought that my new body was sign. Sign that I really was all the things he said to me. I was a slut, a bitch, a toy, even though I was a minor not knowing what was happening to me. Because my new features I slowly started to accept my place that he always said I belong to.

He developed another habit after he couldn't spy me no more when I was sleeping, he started to try to stalk me while I was showering. My mom caught him and it was ruined too. 

I always looked at the other girls at school. How many friends they had and how social they were and how much fun they had. I was lonely, because my abuse made me kinda distant. I had only a one friend. I wanted what they had. I wanted the freedom I thought i never could have. 

When I was 12 i was like a pile of ash under his boot, but not for long. I saw my moment of hope. I saw my moment of finally getting what I truly deserve. And then the thing he didn't expect to never happen happened. I rose like a phoenix out of the ashes that he thought were with no worth. I opened the wings what he thought he had cut off from my back. I showed that ones i've risen I can't be stopped. Once my true power is shown and once I show to the one who doesn't understand it what i'm really capable off.

I finally told my mom. She understood and my coming out of my abuse was the last nail to the coffin of divorce. I felt finally the freedom that i waited to have so long. I was the happiest girl in the universe and my happiness continues to this day. I have decided my life to help people in abusive situations and help them in the healing process too.

They thought they could stop us from speaking, but when we all open our wings of power the abusers become speechless infront of us all. When they see all the things we gonna accomplish. They don't understand their deeds until the day comes for us to rise up. Us who they thought have no worth.

I'm greatful to my mom that believed me without questions. That was something I really needed. 
I'm greatful to myself. I thought I might be trapped in his chains of manipulation on his floor of control forever, with no escape, but was brave enough to break all of them, because the thing that mattered the most was to get my freedom back get happiness back that i had. 

It's been a long journey. I have tried to heal and it has been effective, even though somethings trigger painful flashbacks. I strongly encourage everyone to work towards a better life. Work towards a life with the freedom and independence we need.",prismmxrose,2020-04-22 04:53:47,11,1049,21.63,23.44,93.77,15.11,12.95,12.58,95.14,62.06,25.17,19.83,13.16,0.86,0.19,4.19,1.43,5.34,4.67,12.58,8.67,6.39,6.86,2.1,19.83,4,2.29,1.81,1.62,2,5.34,2.29,3.05,0.86,1.05,0.57,10.39,0.95,0.19,0.86,4.48,12.58,2.96,1.72,1.62,2.1,1.91,3.24,2.86,1.14,1.05,0.67,2.38,1.43,0.95,0.19,0.1,6.77,1.62,1.72,2,1.05,0.86,10.77,6.58,1.24,16.68,2.29,7.72,7.34,0.57,0.48,1.05,0.29,0,0.1,0.76,0.19,0.48,0.1,0,0,12.11,7.53,2.38,0,0,0,0.19,0.19,0.19,1.62,0,0

I am 27 year old male recent college graduate from New York City who still lives with his Parents. I am only one in the house with a bachelor degree. I am a personal trainer for It has been difficult while working or getting a good night sleep since my room is between my brother and sister room who also still live with my parents. They stay up very late with the tv up very loud, speaking loud to their partner, or at times having loud sex. They don’t care that I have to work very early the next morning.They also like blasting music from their loud speakers. Whenever I tell them especially my brother that if he could please lower down his tv or the music because I have to be up early he gets very frustrated and tells me that I don’t pay rent. In college I would put all my classes at night to get be well rested for class but in most jobs I can’t pick a certain schedule. Yesterday I wish I would of recorded my brother last night who came home drunk arguing loud with his girlfriend and punching walls at 4 am in morning to show you guys proof of what I deal with in the daily basis. Last summer, I had a job where I had to be up at 6am. At the time my brother would be smoking a lot of weed in his apartment especially when I was asleep and the smel of weed would travel to my to my room and it would have be up all night. I rarely got any sleep last summer. My parents are afraid of my brother reactions so they get away with acting that way. I am hoping you you could help me get out this toxic environment. It would mean the world to me.

g651yz,"I [M21] want to break up with my girlfriend [F20] of almost two years, who I've recently come to the conclusion is emotionally abusive and manipulative. I'm terrified and I don't know how. Please help.","Alright. This is gonna be a long one - I think that the full history of everything is important, but obviously your time is your time. There'll be a TL;DR at the bottom. [I posted this at /r/relationships but they removed it and said it'd be better here].

Ok so, I've posted here about my relationship before. Those posts were removed for various reasons but got a lot of attention and the comment sections are pretty much exclusively telling me that this relationship is abusive. I ignored it because I guess that's what I do.

Recently I've been talking to an old friend of mine and he indirectly made me realize that I've lost control of my life. My girlfriend is currently staying on an internship in a state about 900 miles away. Quarantine has prevented trips and it's making things a lot worse than they even normally are.

To sum up what she's done to me. Essentially, she yells constantly at me - I've tried multiple times talking about and even demanding that she stops yelling at me but she insists its how she was raised and she refuses to stop. She controls nearly every aspect of my life. She's ALWAYS with me - unless I am literally in class or something important is happening, she's there. I didn't mind this originally because I enjoy spending time with her, but it became clear that I had no space and when I tried bringing it up it resulted in the worst fight of our relationship and she treated me like a horrible person for two weeks and even still she tells me how fucked up it is that I ask for space. These days, if I wake up too late she gets pissed because I'm leaving her alone for too long. If she finds out I'm not eating well, she gets mad because I don't care about my appearance or health and it causes a fight. If she finds out I'm not doing well in my classes she gets pissed because I'm not doing what I need to be doing. If I do ANYTHING she doesn't like, it's a ""Hm"" and an eyeroll and a fight starts.

I recently began realizing that I lost all my friends outside of the two she's introduced into my life. It's never ""you're not allowed to hang out with _____"" but when I did, she would make up a problem, and also be mad at me if I don't text here every ~10 minutes at the LONGEST. That's constant, by the way. Any gap in texting beyond 10 minutes without a good reason like class, sleep, or I'm working on homework is met with ""I guess you're busy...."" and now I have to make up for it. She would do that, and make up problems to get upset about when I would visit my friends and it just became exhausting. My friends stopped hanging out with me because they like my girlfriend but they sometimes just wanted to hang out with me and I can't go anywhere without her without her getting pissed that I would want to exclude her.

When we are in a fight, it is agonizing. Initially, it's usually annoyance, and she expects me to cheer her up and make up for it. She expects me to make the right moves and calm her down from being annoyed, while staying happy myself. If I can't do it or do it wrong, she gets so pissed that I still don't know how to cheer her up and I still can't do this for her. As a result, for the past year or so we've fought 3-4 times a week, with an occasional good period of a few weeks every once and a while. I have maybe started 4-5 fights in the entire relationship and they end when she apologizes. Her fights last hours, and end with me bawling and being upset, although a lot of the time she gets mad that I'm crying because she says it's not fair and makes her feel bad so she can't be upset about her own problems.

All of this has been constantly happening. And I've been silent about it to my friends. I've stopped playing video games, which were my main hobby, because any time I want to play a game on my own she's upset because I'm not including her and not paying attention to her. I don't call my friends on discord any more because every time I do, after ~30 minutes she'll ask me to mute it and tell me she's sad that I'm talking to them and not her. I set alarms at 10 AM every day because any later and she'll be mad that I slept in that late. I stay up until 4-5 in the morning because since she's in another state, I can be awake and do the things I enjoy. I'm so sleep deprived. A few days ago she was like ""you should sleep in tomorrow I know you're tired"" and when I woke up it was 5pm. Obviously she was pissed and that was the rest of my day - dealing with that.

Anyways, that's her. I only really recently realized that this isn't how I should be feeling in a relationship and that I deserve better. I don't want to brag but I know that I'm a good, sweet, and caring person and I deserve a lot better. I've never, ever given her any of the shit she's given me. I want to break up with her, and thanks to me being drunk and texting my friend now I have people in my corner encouraging me to do it and helping me. It's really nice to not be alone.

However, it's not as easy as it seems even for abusive relationship standards. My girlfriend believes that we are an extremely good couple. Her mom and dad have essentially the same relationship - her mom controls every aspect of everyone in the house's life, including my girlfriend. The other day she was telling me how much she thinks that her and I have a more advanced and mature relationship compared to anyone we know. Additionally, she's """"""""Broken up"""""""""" with me 17-18 times in the past. I came to realize around the 10th time that these are just attempts to get me to try to fight for her back. If I don't, it's screaming about how I'm a terrible person who wouldn't even fight for her etc. etc. and, well, it's clear that the relationship was never really over. I'm weak and easily manipulated, I guess.

She's alone in that state. If you couldn't guess, she HATES being alone at any point in her life. She cries nearly every day due to the isolation and she hates that she's so lonely and has no friends up there and spends all day alone in her apartment. For me personally? That sounds ideal - I very much enjoy being alone (although these days I have a way higher appreciation for it because of this). Anyways, additionally, from day ~30 we've been telling each other we love each other, talking about kids, marriage, kid names, our future - it's always been assumed from way back then that we're gonna be together for life. Every night I write her a text about how much I love her and adore her and want her to have a good day, etc etc. She relies so heavily on me. Her family is abusive (she just doesn't consider it that) and I know if I break up with her, her family is gonna drive up to her state and that's the last thing she wants. Her birthday is in 2 weeks and it's her 21st and she's already been so sad that nobody's gonna be able to be with her for it.

I know that all these reasons are stupid and I'm more important. It's just weighing so hard on my mind.

I fucked up today - I tried to break up with her. I fumbled and got scared and took it back before I even said it, but I had already started. We've been in a fight because I've been super busy with schoolwork or sleeping, and haven't had much time for her - ""we've only talked for a few hours a day for like a week now :///"". Anyways, tonight the fight got intense and about an hour after she said she went to sleep, she texted me ""Do you still love me"" and I said yes, and she said ""Do you still want all the things we've promised"" and I said yes, but I'm worried that I'm not enough for you - we fight so much and I cry 3-4 times a week and we've just been getting worse and im worried that i wont be enough to improve and make things better (or some shit idk I can't open my phone to check cuz she'll know I was awake this late).

So she calls me because of this and is bawling and asks me if what the fuck I'm talking about. This is where I faltered and said I'm worried we're not right, I want to be with you, I'm just worried, etc etc. and after like 10 minutes she just flips shit and is all shaking and shit, and then it turns into ""I've said these things to you a lot of times and I never thought I'd hear it from you, but you always convince me that it's all going to be okay so I'm gonna do the same thing for you"" and said a bunch of extremely sweet shit and said that we're gonna make it, she knows we're meant to be and she's known from day one, and she loves me and knows that we can get through this.

So I accept it, crying, and tell her thank you.

I don't know how to break up with her after this. I'm miserable and it gets worse every day but I worry that she's just gonna go completely ballistic and think I'm such an awful person and as much as I hate it, I care about being yelled at and about how she feels about me.
Please give me some advice. I know this was long and I appreciate you helping me here. Thank you.

tl;dr: My girlfriend is extremely controlling, manipulative, and I've lost control of my life. I want to end things but I'm having a lot of difficulty. Please help me find a way to do this and be brave doing it.

EDIT: Since I reposted this from /r/relationships, it's morning now &amp; I have a bit of an update. This morning she texted me a long text about how she loved me and still thinks we can make it through this and that ""infinity means forever, and that's why you bought me that promise ring"" (barf, i know, but she so heavily implied she wanted one last christmas). Then around 11 she texted ""Hope you're sleeping well I love you and miss you"" which is very uncharacteristic of her - I can tell she wants to tell me to wake up. She called while I was typing (she's working) and I told her basically what I was gonna type (I know I'm weak for this) which is I love you and I'm still worried but I want this too and I miss you and love you. She didn't sound very convinced but told me I should rest my eyes since I told her I didn't sleep well last night.",ClickThePlayTabUpTop,2020-04-22 10:11:02,1,1977,8.23,48.58,59.6,9.57,21.03,12.7,95.25,62.57,25.75,18.46,10.27,0.96,1.26,5.67,0.3,7.28,3.74,11.68,11.23,6.73,9.81,2.33,21.85,4.4,2.02,1.47,1.37,2.63,8.3,3.49,4.81,0.81,2.07,1.11,14.26,0.3,0.71,5.72,0.1,14.01,2.48,2.93,2.12,2.63,1.92,3.59,1.67,0.3,1.06,0.2,2.68,1.11,0.71,0.15,0.25,8.45,3.39,0.91,2.43,1.26,0.81,4.91,14.16,1.21,13.91,1.47,5.16,7.33,0.66,0.51,0.2,0.2,0.05,0,2.02,0.66,0.71,0.25,0.3,0.2,18.51,4.86,3.59,0.1,0.15,0.05,0,0.81,1.47,5.82,0.61,1.06

Anytime I would tell an adult, they would tell me I'm over-exagerrating or that it was normal. Sometimes, they would just ask me ""What the hells wrong with you?!"" in an angry or agitated tone.

g65pff,How do I know if my parents are mentally abusing me,"Every day becomes harder and harder to be happy and all I want to do is run away.

It feels like my parents are too toxic and I cry almost everyday, but I can’t help but think I’m just ungrateful and making a scene for attention.

They yell at me every day but maybe that’s because it seems like I’ve developed a lot of anger issues.

My old psychologist once told me my family needed therapy because we had an “unhealthy relationship with each other” 

I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and an addiction to self harm for almost half a year now and I’ve asked my mom for help before but it’s always a dead end, she doesn’t take it serious. I never told her everything of course. Nor my psychologist.

I’m just an arrogant daughter... I have all I want, I don’t struggle with money but I still complain. I’m the problem... 

I know they wish I was a better person

I spend normally 22h a day in my bedroom.

I know it’s all my fault. I only harm myself because I want attention. I try not to but anger and frustration always get to me.

My dad once told me he wish I was never born. I wish that too. He also says simular things to my mom but she ends up forgetting and making up excuses for why he says those things. She usually tells me he doesn’t mean it.

He also talks about my maternal grandma dying and tries to make me hate her often. It seems like the fact that she’s alive bothers him. My mom does nothing.

Sometimes my dad yells at me because I won’t get him a beer or something like that. My mom always taught me how to make him happy and how to successfully lie to him.

They argue a lot and there’s times when it’s so bad my dad will stop talking to the whole family for days. 

But my mom’s not the victim here, they’d both tell me I’m useless or worthless and she’s always more aggressive with her word choice. She’s tell me I’m a piece of sh*t various times.

I just want to be normal.

Help me please",Morita_Chiaki,2020-04-22 10:46:04,15,385,8.4,26.65,70.07,1,13.75,12.73,97.4,58.96,25.71,20.78,14.81,0.26,0,4.68,1.04,4.94,4.16,9.35,9.35,6.75,9.09,2.86,21.04,3.9,2.6,1.3,0.78,3.38,7.53,1.3,6.23,0.26,2.6,0.78,15.32,3.9,0,4.42,3.12,19.74,3.38,3.12,2.86,3.9,3.9,4.16,1.82,0,1.04,0.78,1.56,0,1.3,0,0.26,7.01,2.34,1.04,2.6,1.3,1.04,2.86,15.84,1.3,9.35,0.26,1.82,7.27,1.56,0.78,0.78,0.52,0,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.58,7.79,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,0.52,5.97,0,0.26
g67pqv,Are my relationships with my sister and mother emotionally abusive/toxic? Do I sound like I’m being overdramatic?,"I (18F) don’t really know where to start with this, but over the last year or so I’ve began to recognise that some of my family relationships might be emotionally abusive, specifically with my mother and older sister. Though I don’t know if I’m being dramatic? And these aren’t recent things, it’s just that I’m only beginning to realise that maybe things aren’t so right. That’s why I want to ask advice to just figure things out. 

I’ll start with my sister. Ever since I remember, she’s been mean to me. I’ve always thought that it was just sibling rivalry stuff, or that I was just annoying. She’s about nine years older than me, with her currently being 27, and me 18. Whenever I see her I feel anxious, and just try get away from her as soon as possible. Whenever she speaks I hope to god it isn’t to me. Sometimes we’ve had nice moments, but I feel like those are once in a year, because since I can remember of our interactions (mostly from me being age 10 to now), the majority of our interactions have been her criticising me, being snarky towards me, snapping at me, and acting like the smallest thing I did that she didn’t like was the most appalling most awful thing in the world. I feel as if whenever she looks at me, it’s with disgust, and I get nervous whenever she looks at me. I rarely cry when people are harsh to me, but nowadays she can say the smallest of things and I want to hide in my room, cry and bite my arms (it’s a habit I used to have when I got upset, but I sometimes go back to it). I don’t know if I’m being dramatic, or if this is toxic? She just really makes me anxious and depressed, and I don’t know if it’s me over analysing things.

Then there’s my mum. It’s a bit more difficult with her because unlike my sister, sometimes she can be caring and loving to me. But I always am scared of what I say because sometimes I’d say something and she’d snap at me, and I don’t know why. I always actively try to make sure I have a level tone when I talk to her nowadays to avoid this. She can be very passive aggressive towards me, and much like my sister I try avoiding getting into situations with her. 
Another thing is that my earliest memories of her is her telling me off for crying, and I remember one time I purposefully scratched myself after having a breakdown and when she saw me after the fact, she told me off and told me she didn’t want to want to send me to a shrink, at least that’s how I remember it. It’s why I took to biting myself, because whenever she saw me cry or saw a similar self inflicted scar, she’d get angry with me and I found that bites faded quickly.

I don’t want to talk about these issues with them, because whenever I have tried to talk about similar things to them, I just get told I’m being overdramatic or silly, or I’m snapped at. So maybe I am, but I’m not so sure anymore, and this is all beginning to feel worse because of the fact that I have to self isolate with them.  

But yeah. Sorry if this is rambly or makes no sense, I don’t really know how to phrase myself or what I should do. There’s some more things, but I think this all summarises it, Thanks for reading and if there’s any advice you can give me I’d greatly appreciate it.",QuinTheJester,2020-04-22 12:33:30,3,639,4.27,13.66,91.16,3.44,22.03,13.62,95.31,65.88,26.76,19.25,14.24,0.47,0.16,3.91,0.47,7.51,2.35,12.99,12.83,7.51,11.11,2.19,22.38,5.48,3.76,2.82,0.94,2.19,5.79,1.72,4.07,1.1,0.94,1.1,10.33,1.56,0,5.16,0,17.68,3.76,2.82,2.19,5.32,1.72,5.48,2.82,0.94,0.78,0.94,0.47,0.16,0.31,0,0,6.1,2.35,0.78,1.1,1.1,0.78,4.07,16.74,0.78,11.74,0.47,4.07,7.51,0.16,0.47,0.31,0,0.16,0,0.16,0,0,0.16,0,0,17.84,3.91,5.79,0,0,0.63,0,0,0,6.42,0.94,0.16

g6audi,No way out,"Hi, I'm a big fat hot mess and this is gonna be long. Using throwaway for obvious reasons. Just want to let it out.

Met a guy online when I was like 15. On again off again kinda thing. Kept in touch repeatedly over the years. Finally a year and a half ago took the leap to be with him.

I was living with someone else I'd met in the same web space around the same time. Didn't have a choice, life was rough, he offered a room... and took advantage while I was under the influence, which destroyed me tbh. Told bf about it and expressed it as ""I think I cheated, I'm scum, you shouldn't be with me"" and HE was the one who assured ME it was attempted rape after he got the deets. You can guess how supported and loved I felt in a really hellish time.

Cut to me moving in... dude lives with his mom to help take care of her, I hoped I could help out too. Instead I fell deeply ill with constant seizures that just would not stop.

From the very beginning, started getting screamed at by his mom, who called me lazy and a faker and thought I was avoiding her when I'd be laid up in bed from all the constant seizing. They tell me that doesn't matter because she was on steroids. Ok i get that and I've never ONCE been anything but polite to her because they told me about her issues (although sometimes I'd vent to him about the same things that annoyed him, which got me screamed at more because apparently he's the only one allowed to be mad at her - he screams at her all the time too), but at the same time, nobody gave a flying fk how any of her angry outbursts affected me. Not once. Just ""oh she's just like that.""

Couldn't put my stuff anywhere. At all. To this day I basically am living in his tiny room which is all decked out with his stuff, with about 4x4ft of space for mine. When I pushed for space, he screamed at me. I've stopped even trying.

I'm basically bedridden and everyone thinks I'm faking or just a fatass. Yeah I'm fat but ALSO NOT FAKING. I have seizures over the dumbest crap, it's not as easy as ""just do more exercise lol"" and not some excuse. The back of my head swells with fluid up to the size of a fking orange sometimes when I seize y'all, this ain't a joke, I'm not ok, and nobody gives a damn.

I get screamed at for literally everything under the sun. ESPECIALLY when any of my mental illness symptoms show up. He honed in on my panic attacks, screaming at me for every single one.

I complained to a support group. I was furious and rightly so. I regret it, not only because I guess it got back to him or his mom or both, who later started menacingly quoting my posts back at me, but because I probably complained too harshly idk. They even started quoting my fking journal entries at me when I'd vent journal tho, and I seriously don't know how they're messing with my phone where I journal, because i keep trying to safeguard myself. That shiz continues to this day. It's too specific to be just paranoia. It's real and happening. But nobody listens to someone like me. They never do.

If I call them on anything or even remotely, even calmly stand up for myself, i get screamed at more. It is endless. They both do it. It never fking ends.

I'm told I'm supposed to ""listen"" to him which inevitably means obey, do not disagree, do not argue, do not question.

I can't ""just leave"". Law enforcement seemed quietly amused and didn't believe a word I said and can't do anything unless he assaults me and don't care that he sexually abused me. No resources in my area. I tried. Multiple times now. I am trapped.

I'm not an angel. I'll be the first to tell you this. I don't respond well to abuse. I fight it. I tell them off, I get verbally feisty when someone attacks me, and I do feel defensive and agitated because of all this which makes me overreact at the wrong times sometimes because I think he's starting in on me again BECAUSE HE DOES IT SO MUCH. I hide. I try and try and try. I vent when and where I can. I look for help. I have mental illness and it shows. Panic attacks, cPTSD, eating disorder, DID features, gender/sexuality confused af, schizo. But I try, I use my coping skills, I go to therapy, take my pills...unlike him, who prefers to yell at me that I'm not doing enough while refusing to get help for himself.

He threatens me when I go to therapy saying he doesn't want me to ""lie"" and say I'm the victim when I ""cause him"" to do all of this. Tried and tried to block me from therapy too.

I'm haunted online. Seemingly everywhere I go now. I'm terrified beyond all reason. He seems to be spreading things everywhere as retaliation for that time I vented, spinning it in the worst possible way, telling everyone he's the victim basically. Not sure about that because I have had stalkers before too and it could be just more of that, that's a whole other bucket of stupid I won't dump on y'all, I mean welcome to the internet, that crap just sadly happens sometimes.

I think I'm going to die tbh. I literally don't think I will survive this dark part of my life.

There is absolutely nowhere to run and absolutely nobody cares.

I have no friends left. Nobody wants to be friends with someone who isolates sometimes and shows symptoms of mental illness sometimes. The stigma is crushing.

Part of my illness is an overwhelming loss of sense of self, and everyone accuses me of faking when the truth is I'm genuinely struggling to understand basic social skills and GENUINELY DO NOT KNOW who tf I am and have been trying out different things to figure that out over the years.

But honestly? At this point?

I've accepted I'm probably just scum and will never have friends.

I just wanted to speak my truth before it ends.

Because I feel like I'm going to die here.
I really really do.
One of these abuse-imposed panic attacks is gonna give me a heart attack or a deadly seizure and that'll be it.
And they'll all laugh.

Oh well.
I tried.
I really really did.

Know what the worst part is?

Pretty sure I will love him to the end anyways.
That's what makes it hurt so much.
I'll always love him.",tossaccount999,2020-04-22 15:24:50,0,1156,15.42,20.08,83.03,1.76,12.3,15.74,93.43,60.64,22.92,15.83,11.33,0,0.43,3.37,0.69,7.09,4.15,12.46,10.03,7.79,7.44,3.63,19.55,3.81,2.08,2.51,0.87,2.34,8.04,2.51,5.45,0.87,2.34,0.52,10.38,0.26,0.52,1.04,2.77,14.97,2.51,2.16,1.12,3.89,2.77,3.81,2.68,0.52,1.47,0.61,2.94,0.52,1.9,0.26,0.43,7.53,1.47,1.64,2.94,1.3,0.78,4.33,12.63,1.12,13.58,1.3,6.57,5.97,0.35,0.35,0.26,0,0.17,0.17,2.25,0.43,0.95,0.43,0.35,0.17,18.94,8.39,3.98,0,0,0.26,0,0.17,1.21,4.67,0.17,0.09

Then my friend messaged him being all concerned with how low I was feeling and he said I was being manipulative. He then ignored me for 12 hours and then called me the next morning to break up with me, saying he couldn't do it anymore. In the past he said I was being very manipulative and examples of me apparently doing this is me saying ""I'm sorry you don't understand what I'm saying, I'll explain it better"". Also another way I apparently manipulated him was he made me very upset as he said a condition I have was fake and I was making up excuses and it made me cry, so I asked if I could go to his to talk about it and he said yeah and I was like ""thank you. I'll be over soon, I just need to clean up"" because I had been crying and he was like you can't say that, that is very manipulative and if you ever say things like that again I'll break up with you, so at that point I really struggled to open up to him, it made me feel like s*** and it made me feel like I had to watch everything I had to say to him. When we broke up I found out that he cheated on me at the start and i confronted him about it on Instagram direct message and he said I was just making up excuses to blame him and I was apparently trying to make him out to be the bad one when it's apparently me. He's being telling everyone I was abusing him mentally, saying I was manipulative and gaslighting him. I now have no confidence in myself and I am beginning to wonder if its me or not, I really struggle to see positive in my self and I have been diagnosed with anxiety recently because of the way he's treated me and made me feel. I went to move out my flat yesterday and move back home with parents because college is closed and I then went to my exes to pick my stuff and he had wrote me letter telling me how he hopes I get the help I apparently need from being manipulative and he says that I apparently never loved him and apparently I was just an overall bad person and I'm lying to myself. It's made me feel so bad because I'm now questioning whether I'm the bad person or not. He made me feel so low when we broke up that I tried to take my own life. I am just really struggling atm.",misspurple99,2020-04-22 15:51:04,3,497,3.88,45.2,72.27,1,29.24,12.88,97.99,67.81,28.37,22.74,14.89,0.4,1.01,6.44,0,5.63,2.21,11.67,11.47,7.44,10.66,1.61,25.35,2.01,1.61,1.81,1.01,0.4,6.84,1.61,5.03,1.01,1.01,1.81,16.5,0.2,0.4,0,6.64,14.89,2.62,5.03,2.01,3.82,1.41,2.62,5.03,0.6,3.02,1.41,0.6,0,0.4,0,0,9.66,2.21,1.01,5.63,1.01,0.8,10.87,10.87,1.61,12.88,1.21,6.24,5.23,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0,0,0.8,0,0.2,0.4,0,0,10.06,3.22,2.01,0,0,0,0,0,0.8,3.02,0.4,0.6

g6dzhx,advice?,"this is a long story so buckle up. 
my ex and i broke up for the second time in january. she was my first love and i was wrapped around her finger. she used me, lied, manipulated and gaslit me. she was very emotionally and mentally abusive and her effects on me are extensive. before her, i was a virgin who’d never done anything, and after about a month we were having sex a lot. i’d never felt that way before and it made me feel wanted. we ended very badly and i still hate her deeply for how she hurt me. but i realized something recently, if i wanted to, i could bring up criminal charges against her. not for the abuse, there’s too much grey area and it wouldn’t be worth it. but, there’s one incident that i still have against her. 
one day i was at a youth center that i was doing some volunteer work at. this was after we broke up the first time and we had discussed being friends with benefits because we both didn’t want to lose each other for good. so we decided to take the first step. i gave my phone to a friend to hold for me (my parents check my location so i had to leave it at the center.), checked out early and she took me to her house. we were alone, we had sex, and she took me back to the center. i got my phone, thanked my friend and went home. the one thing i haven’t mentioned yet is that when this happened, i was 15 and she was 18. the age of consent in my state is 16. we had had a previous relationship and previous sexual experiences with each other when we were both minors, but idk how that affects these types of cases. 
i’m not sure that i want to tell someone about this because i don’t know how much i really want to delve into it with a lawyer. but on the other hand, i hate that she got away with the month of abuse and pain she put me through. i also hate the idea that other people are going to get into relationships with her and have no idea. 
(also, she’s trans so we did have penetrative sex, ik that might be a factor in it if i brought this up as a case)",switchesarebest,2020-04-22 18:42:40,0,405,14.84,41.22,76.99,3.92,16.2,10.37,94.07,64.69,24.69,17.28,10.12,2.72,0,4.44,0,7.41,5.19,12.84,10.86,6.42,9.14,2.47,20,2.22,1.48,1.48,2.47,1.98,4.69,1.23,3.46,0,1.73,1.23,11.85,0.25,0.74,4.44,0,12.59,1.98,2.72,2.22,1.98,0.74,4.2,2.47,0.25,0.49,1.48,2.22,0.49,0.25,1.23,0,9.88,4.44,1.23,2.22,1.98,0.25,10.37,7.65,0.49,15.8,1.73,7.16,7.16,0.74,0,0.49,0.25,0,0,0.49,0,0.25,0,0,0.25,13.83,5.93,4.2,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,2.47,0.99,0

g6ee31,Can I request a DNR and request my abusers/abusive family are not allowed to see my body if I die/become incapacitated?,"This is a very grim topic and I am asking for advice. 

As of late I have been highly suicidal and unfortunatley was thinking about death, also potentially thinking and worrying about getting into an accident on my motorcycle.

Keep these things in mind and also feel free to glance at my post history.

*Yes I do have intense trauma therapy, but because of covid-19 its all over the phone lately.*

*NO I do not have anyone on this earth to use as an emergency contact or someone I could trust or care for me if I was harmed.* 

*This means I have no trusted friends, no other family. No one. I have no one on this earth I am close to.* 

I am frequently trying to engage in hobbies to stay ""sane"". I am not in any immediate danger.

I had drunkenly ordered a roadID that was supposed to have medical information and contact info on it. Instead I left a chillingly sad message on it and forgot about it until it showed up on my doorstep weeks later while I am now sober.

*I do not drink often*

An employee actually had to engrave and hand pack that medical bracelet and I feel terrible. 

I am constantly suffering from night terrors, motor tics, crying spells, and anhedonia due to trauma. I stutter and slurr often. It's a long story but I am truly alone. Internet aquaintences are kind and I am thankful for them, but it never blossoms into something in which I feel close to them or vice versa. 


*How can I make it known to medical professionals that I do not have an emergency contact incase I die?* 

I do not want my abusers to get giddy and happy and circle jerk over my death. They have reacted this way to my sexual assault, homelessness, abuse, and hospitalizations. They genuinley enjoyed and talked ill about me and laughed at my misfortunes.

g6eww8,My neighbor saved my life,"Warning: there are some graphic details 

When I was 18 I married a guy I didn’t know very well. The young romantic in me met him and fell completely in love with this cool artsy guy in about 3 months. He had me move in with him and convinced me to quit my job because he could take care of me. He was really weird about having visitors because he was pretty well off financially and was paranoid about people stealing from him and using him for his money, so I slowly lost contact with a lot of my friends. Within 6 month of being married, I got pregnant. Sex hurt during my pregnancy so it greatly affected my libido. It didn’t take long for that to upset my husband. He claimed that it was my duty as his wife to satisfy him or be willing to allow him to cheat to fulfill his needs and he began to use this to convince me to have sex when I didn’t want to. It hurt so bad that I actually cried and it didn’t bother him at all. This should’ve been a huge red flag, but I was young and dumb and didn’t realize how wrong this was. One time I actually said no, he waited til I fell asleep; I woke up to an immense pressure on my neck and chest, he had pinned me down to where I couldn’t move and had his way. I finally had the baby. I delivered naturally and the Dr. advised us not to have sex for at least six weeks to allow my body to heal. My husband decided that 3 weeks was long enough for him to wait and once again pinned me down and shoved a face cloth in my mouth so I couldn’t make noise. I could barely breathe and it hurt more than giving birth did. I thought I was going to die. He ripped the stitches and I had to go back to the hospital. About 4 months later I joined a mommy and me group where I met a few women and their kids. I became really friendly with one in particular and we would go to lunch after our class sometimes. I gave her my phone number so we could meet up for play dates outside of the group. One morning I was savagely awaken by being grabbed by my leg and thrown out of bed against a wall. My friend from the group and had texted “want to get together later?” My husband saw the text and assumed it was from a guy talking about getting together in a sexual manner. I explained to him who it was and even invited him to come to our play date. He apologized for being so paranoid and declined to come but requested that I stop spending so much time with “those people”. I wanted to leave him after that, but I was 19 with no job, no car, no home, and a baby. I was 100% dependent on him for mine and my child’s wellbeing, so I stayed. The first time he hit me it was because I bought peanut butter when I went out for groceries. He was allergic to peanuts and accused me of trying to kill him, he threw the jar at my head and slapped me across the face as I headed out of the room. He later made my favorite food for dinner and bought me a new bracelet. He apologized for losing his temper and explained that even using utensils that hadn’t been washed after touching peanut products could be extremely harmful to him and in a panic he reacted and wasn’t proud of his behavior. It became pretty routine for him to lose his temper, get physical and then buy me something nice and apologize later. I ended up with several broken bones and was always coached to memorize some story to explain in the Emergency Room. I talked about getting a job, but he refused. We had plenty of money and our baby needed me at home. I wanted to leave, but I was terrified of ending up on the streets with nothing and no way to take care of my son. One day we got into an argument over something so trivial I don’t even remember what it was. It got really bad, he always had a gun in the house for personal security, but it always remained in the gun safe and I never worried about it. For some reason this day, he pulled it out. I don’t know when he grabbed it, all I know is I was arguing and then I was staring into the barrel of a ruger .380. He pulled the trigger and thank whatever higher being is in the universe, it jammed. I fought it away from him, but it went off during the altercation. This woke our son up, I ran to the baby’s room to soothe him and my husband followed. He grabbed me by my hair and threw me against the wall of my sons room and began to choke me. I couldn’t breathe, I got really dizzy, I’m pretty sure I passed out. Next thing I remember is a police officer handing my baby and telling me to just remain calm. Apparently, my next door neighbor heard the gunshot and called 911. My husband went to jail and I was given a restraining order. The same neighbor agreed to babysit so I could find work and before he was released, I had my own apartment and divorce papers drafted. I often wonder if I would still be here if it weren’t for my neighbor.",olewatsherface,2020-04-22 19:48:33,1,961,39.25,44.21,68.75,15.52,18.84,14.15,93.86,58.9,20.92,16.65,10.61,0.94,0,4.99,0.1,4.27,4.47,14.67,7.39,5.1,8.32,2.19,18.31,4.37,1.66,1.04,1.66,1.56,6.24,2.6,3.33,0.73,1.04,0.73,13.32,1.98,1.25,0.42,6.04,10.72,2.08,1.66,1.98,1.98,1.04,2.81,1.77,0.42,0.42,0.83,3.54,1.25,1.14,0.73,0.52,9.26,3.75,1.04,2.39,1.46,0.94,9.99,4.79,0.31,15.4,3.02,6.76,5.83,1.14,0.42,1.46,0.73,0,0.21,0.42,0.1,0,0.1,0.21,0,10.41,5.2,2.6,0.1,0.1,0.1,0,0,0.42,1.77,0,0.1

g6fhy6,I suffered 2+ years of abuse at the hands of my husband,"My ex, my husband. The person who was supposed to protect me, care for me, love me. He abused me emotionally, verbally, physically and sexually.

I didn’t even realize I had been abused until the first time he hit me. And even then, I made excuses for him. Then he raped me. Over and over again. Then he hit me again. And again. And again. He joked about killing me. He joked about killing himself in front of me. He joked about killing our pets. He traumatized me.
I escaped one day. 3 years and 2 months ago.

I am eating again. I don’t drink as much anymore. I don’t want to kill myself anymore. I have a loving, caring, kind partner. He is respectful of my past.
I am going to my first therapy session. I am still all sorts of fucked up. I still use alcohol to cope. I still flinch when someone reaches towards me, yells, or seems remotely upset. I assume when my bf disagrees with me he will hit me. Tell me I’m useless. Threaten to kill me.

My ex still denies all of this. It makes me think I’m crazy. Did I imagine it. Did I interpret it the wrong way? I still feel like I owe him something.

g6j1hn,"I didn't realize what my mother did to me 20 years ago could be considered sexual abuse. I'm struggling to understand the situation, and why it's bothering me so much now (30/F)","I've never told anyone this before. Honestly, for the longest time, I thought it was normal... but now I'm struggling to make sense of it and understand how it's impacted me...
 

I think the easiest thing to do is just list all of the things that are haunting me. 
 
 
 
- When I was 10 years old, we were packing to move. It was late at night. My mother called me over to the kitchen table and said ""do you want to see what a penis looks like?"" And proceeded to show me a PlayGirl magazine, having me look at pictures of naked men with her.
 
 
- My mother next gave me several more very dirty magazines and books. I was 10. I started my period soon thereafter.
 
 
- I became very hyper sexualized from this point, after seeing and reading the porn she gave me. 
 
 
- Her and my father had a terrible relationship. He was abusive. My mother and I started sharing a twin bed because she told me she ""didn't want to have sex with him."" 
 
 
- They almost got divorced. My mom decided she didn't want to deal with the divorce and getting a job. So she made me sit on the porch while she had sex with my father (she openly told me this). I was homeschooled at this time. Afterwards, she showed me the wet spot on her shirt after they had sex. 
 
 
 - My parents eventually divorced when my father started using meth. Shortly afterwards, my mother ordered porn VHS tapes, and she wanted me to watch them with her. She had me sit in the living room and watch them with her, like a parent would a normal movie. She would watch those tapes with me often. 
 
 
 
- I do not remember how this started, but she eventually also had me show her porn videos on the computer. I don't remember the details. But I know I would have to have several porn videos ready for her to watch with me. 
 
 
- One time my uncle came over, and my mom told me to show him a naked picture of a woman that she thought was funny. I did. I didn't know this wasn't normal. 
 
 
- A few years later, mh mom told me about porn she watched on her phone and now she was ""addicted"" to it. 
 
 
- This all stopped and soon afterwards, I got a boyfriend. My mom became violent about me dating, often fighting with me, threatening me, screaming at me, etc. 
 
 
 
All of this happened 15-20 years ago. Honestly, I never really thought about it. But during the last six months, I've been having sexual issues. When my partner and I would have sex, I would start crying afterwards. I've been unable to get aroused... and all of these things slowly were coming to the front of my mind

What I need help understanding:
 

- Was my mom's behavior *that* bad? Prior to this, I just figured we were close, like friends. But is this sexual abuse? 
 
 
- My mom has had a lot of trauma in her life and is kind of emotionally stunted. Is it possible she thought this was normal behavior? 
 

- Why is this bothering me now? I'm 30. I've had many sexual partners. I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years. Why am I suddenly having panic and anxiety over these situations? 
 
 

Any insight is welcome.

g6k55f,I feel wretched for what my brother did for my sake.,"I was playing a game where the older sibling was willing to lay down his life for his brother. And I feel awful. 

When we were kids my parents told my brother that I was different and he needed to look out for me. He was maybe 7 at his oldest. I was maybe 8 and had been diagnosed with autism. I don’t know why my patents put that on him but he always, always felt like he needed to protect me. 

He screamed at me once when we were maybe in middle school that our parents always liked me better and let me get away with so much that he never did and I never understood why he said that until I was older. I was completely shattered psychologically from how my parents treated me, crying every day about horrible things I wouldn’t recall anymore by the time the tears dried. But From his perspective, things were different. I don’t hold it against him but I worry he’s always felt that way. 

When we were both adults, he told me I needed to get out. That he wasn’t going to leave until I moved out because he wasn’t going to leave me alone here. That he could handle it because he always could, but he knew I was barely surviving. 

And he kept up his promise. He didn’t start apartment Hunting until I had moved in with my partner. I didn’t want him to do that but he did. 

I feel terrible. I should have been the one to protect him but every day I’d just sit there and cry and make myself small and invisible instead of being a good older brother and standing up for him. Sometimes I’d try and it would go badly. I don’t know how to forgive myself for letting it happen. I’d stay by his side no matter what but when it came to protecting him in the ways that matter most I didn’t do shit.

g6k9ed,(22/M) I was abused by an older boy when I was 5/6 and that has deeply changed me and my sexuality forever,"I  am writing this here because, for the first time in my life, I finally  told this situation to one of my closest friends in life and her support  and love motivated me to come here and tell a bunch of strangers about  it because, well, it feels good to vent.

When  I was around 5 or 6 years old (maybe even 4), and this is probably one  of my earliest (and strongest, from that time, anyway) memories ever, I  used to go play with my older cousins who were also very close  neighbours. In order to play I would always go to their house very  regularly. They had another friend of their age, who is called Ivo, who  was also a close neighbour, and he would come sometimes and play with  us. They all were 2 to 3 years older than me.

One  time I went to their house to play as usual, but there was nobody home.  I only found Ivo, who lived around, and we played and talked. I was of  course very naïve at that age and could very easily be influenced. I  remember him bringing me to an attic of my cousin's house who was  accessible from the outside. What I remember after this is mostly  fragments, but here's what I remember from that happened next:

I  remember both of us taking our clothes off, and the feeling of our warm  bodies together. I remember us kissing and him touching me. I remember  him being on top and me, and I have a very strong memory related to  touch of his warm penis. And I remember him saying this ""you play the  girl"".

I don't believe there was  any penetration involved, probably because him at that age would also  not know how to do such a thing. Whatever happened in specific, it  involved me being in a submissive state, and I strongly remember in that  moment enjoying being dominated by him, probably because I had no idea  of the implications or morality of such an act.

I  am 22 years old now and I finally told this story to someone. I always  buried it deep within my memories. I remember thinking whatever we were  doing, we were not supposed to tell. During the act Ivo was being  vigilant to see if anyone was coming, and I associated that with not  telling anyone about what just happened, even to my parents. Also being  put in a submissive role probably enforced in my subsconscious that I  was not supposed to tell.

Fast  forward to my early childhood and now my adulthood, even. I have always  enjoyed wearing women's panties and even other types of feminine  clothing like pajamas, bras, tights, pantyhose, stockings, bodysuits,  etc. I remember wearing them (mostly panties) throughout my childhood,  and ever since I got a job I started buying them to wear everyday, but  also as a ""sexual pleasure catalyst"", so to speak. I feel a sense of  thrill wearing them when masturbating while I fantasize about being  dominated or being in the role of a submissive woman. My habits of porn  consumption usually consist of watching trans porn in which I fantasize  being the trans woman.

Couple of  years ago I also bought a dildo and I take great pleasure in the feeling  of being penetrated and dominated by a throbbing cock. I will not say I  am homosexual, though, I believe I am bi and feel strongly attracted to  women, as well as men, although I am in fact a virgin and have had no  actual intercourse with either of them.

Looking  back there is no denying of a strong link between the episode of abuse I  related, and how it wired and changed my brain for life, particularly  in the sense of me feeling submissive and dominated in a sexual way, and  to ""feel like a woman"", or even incorporate one. I do love myself the  way I am and have no guilt related to any of my fetishes, having never  really repressed anything of it. Looking back also do not feel guilty in  that episode as I have come to realize I was a naïve child who had no  idea of the implications of whatever was happening. However, I never  really told anyone as I think my subscounscious buried this episode in a  kind of ""not supposed to tell"" storage file.

Well, this was my story, my confession.

g6ktao,Is it abuse?,"I have had many instances when I know my husband was abusive and controlling ( he had hit an ex girlfriend in front me, he had hit me and our dog), also thrown my laptops on the ground to break them. Most of these things happened years ago but I think I have suffered more from the emotional abuse than the physical one. I am pretty sure he transitioned to emotional abuse and physical through damaging items because one of his colleagues was arrested for domestic abuse. It was like a switch. At the same time, My friends think he is a great guy, always ready to help and having a good image of himself.

We were moving across country, big UHaul truck driven by him, one car in tow, another car I drove with our two kids and dog with me. Along the way, we stop at a gas station. He had insisted I always drive behind him no matter what. He said it was for safety. A couple of times this was ruined because trucks had a speed limit of 35 mph at some points or had to go a different route. I always drove as slow as possible so he can catch up. I drove 55 mph in the right lane behind some large semi trucks when the speed limit was 70 for example.       

Anyhow, we leave the gas station, and he is ahead. We both have GPSs that are the same with the same directions on. He turns to the right when he should have turned left. I try to warn him as I see him heading to the right. I beep at him and call him on the phone. But this happens too fast and there was a car behind me. I had already started turning left (having left blinker and being towards the left) and my reaction to to turn left and proceed to the freeway. He starts cursing on the phone and shuts the phone on me. Then he calls me back and starts yelling at me for not turning after him even though it was the wrong direction. He tells me to turn around, find him and follow him. I try to reason with him that he can catch up and I will pull over somewhere. I had just filled gas at $4 per gallon- much more than the $1.89 we had when we started leaving town. Also there are no exits for miles, we are between LA and Sacramento on I-5, you could drive 30-50 miles easily before being able to turn around. Don’t matter, I need to go back he says and sends me his location.  He said he will wait in place. I tell him I am not coming back. I admit I was stubborn too, we are 3 hours away from Sacramento and I will go to a hotel and wait for him there. I did not want to waste gas going back. I try calling him to reason with him, he won’t answer. Anything I ask my daughter to text him he replies only with his location and saying I will need to go back more if I do not come back right away. 

So then we reach Sacramento, I am exhausted from driving all day. It is 10pm, I rent a hotel room and try to persuade him to come. We have another full day of driving ahead of us. He starts texting me that he will head backwards. I don’t want to be the one to ruin our family so give in to his wishes. First I plead with him and beg him to come to no avail. He tells me to all come back for him and to rent a room in a motel there. I tell him I am very sleepy and do not think I can make the drive safely and it is best for the kids to wait in the nice hotel they are in already, and he says my oldest daughter could be instructed to push me when I get sleepy while driving. After some persuasion he agrees that I leave the kids in the hotel and come for him. 

I drive to multiple gas stations which are closed by now and finally find one to fill gas. I take an energy shot to keep me awake. By the time we come back to the hotel it is early morning - 3-4 am, we sleep until 11 am and have to leave by 12 pm. 

Later on he just sensed I was not happy with him and came to our car angry as hell telling me to admit I was wrong, that I was the one who deserted him and I was the mean one.,. All of this in front of the kids and I start crying. He then backed away and we started traveling again. 

Now we are finally at the apartment we rented and he told me it was all my fault, that I had put the kids in danger by leaving them in the hotel, that what happened was my choice. I told him I knew he was controlling me and just wanted to punish me, his reasoning about “safety” fell apart but he said I was an idiot and the jerk, and crazy. This argument came about because he went in my car and my new car seat pillow was in his way which bugged him so he tore it apart from its straps. I asked him why and I was just so upset. He said: You can sew it together. 

I am sorry for the long post, and the lack of formatting. Writing on my phone. Please tell me if I am the crazy one?",nezabeliazana,2020-04-23 04:15:08,0,988,42.81,69.36,75.3,7.94,17.03,9.21,92.41,59.62,21.26,17.61,8.4,2.02,0.3,6.58,0.3,3.54,5.26,14.17,8.2,4.96,7.29,1.21,19.33,4.45,2.13,1.21,2.33,1.82,4.76,1.62,3.14,0.1,1.32,0.61,14.47,0.4,0.4,0.2,6.78,8,1.92,1.21,1.32,1.62,0.81,1.92,1.52,0.2,1.21,0,0.71,0.4,0.3,0,0,6.68,2.83,1.21,1.42,0.51,1.01,6.58,10.32,1.52,20.75,5.77,9.31,6.58,0.4,0.91,0.91,0.3,0.1,0,0.3,0.2,0,0,0,0,10.63,5.97,2.73,0.1,0,0.2,0,0.51,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.2

g6or4w,What can I do to help my sister in a controlling relationship with verbal abuse?,"I (F25) have a sister (F20) who is together with her boyfriend (M22) since Christmas-ish. I'm now afraid that she is losing herself in the relationship and that the guy is controlling. 

I had a long talk to her about things today and I want some other peoples thoughts. If this isn't the right place for this it's okey to delete or notify me. Following are incidents in my sisters relationship with the guy. 

When she doesn't answer him in minutes he thinks she is cheating. He is following her on snapmap and tracking her route. One time she was out for a run and her snap tracked her position 200 m away from where she really was, she went into a store so snap went funky. He accused her of going to a guy cheating. 

She has no history of cheating and she has values, my personal input. She is hed over heels into this guy. 

She can't go and meet her friends, who she is very very close too and before this met many times a week. He supposedly gets upset when she doesn't spent her free time with him, but he still tells her that she can meet her friends. The rare times she meets up her friend he is getting jealous and suspicious where she is and follows her on snapmap. 

He gives her comments about who she is going to meet (cheat with) when she uses jeans to work or puts on mascara. She can use make up with him but not when she goes outside, for him thats a red flag for cheating or meeting up guys or wanting attention. My sister has always liked to do her hair and she is very talented with make up, and did do that regularly before the relationship. I'm a make up artist and we have a common interest in this. Now she is very unmotivated about make up or fashion. 

On a party couple of weeks ago they were together and there was alcohol. During the night he got a bit too much to drink, my sister was driving and sober. She told him that he had enough and he got angry and drank more. Later at home he started yelling and throwing things in the apartment, he switch from 0-100. She got afraid bc they could lay in bed and cuddle and the next second he was up, angry and lying about things and throwing stuff. The neighbors came to the apartment and complained about the high voice and sounds. My sister didn't get hurt but she got very afraid about it. The next day he doesn't remember everything that happened and tells her she is against him when she tells the things that happened. 

Everytime she is home at my parents he starts a fight or a argument and ignores her messages until she takes a car and goes to his place to talk, then he is happy and the situation calms down. She once went to our grandparents after a night shift to sleep and he got upset and didn't understand why she would do such thing and then thought she was at some guys place. My grandparents live in a village with no younger people in it. Only three families are there and all are either retired farmers or family with no kids staying at home. 

He wants photo proof on where she is. If she goes to a store she needs to send a pic to him on snap. He wants them only to communicate on snap photos, so he can see what she does and where she is. This led to that my sister is on her phone while driving, afraid that she would miss out on a snap and make him angry. 

He doesn't take a no. When sex is on the table and she isn't up for it he takes it personal and makes himself the victim and also begging her to have sex. 

The guy also asked her if she really loves him, while she is not jealous i the relationship. He loves her and thats why he is jealous. For me this is crazy and not a sign of love. 

She told me today, terrified, that she told her bf that she forgot to answer his snap this morning after a 9 hour night shift at work. She saw a unsent snap when she woke up and thought she forgot to answer him. She told him sorry when they called straight after she woke up.
The bf told her that he didn't sent her a snap and he got upset and asked her who she got a snap from. I think she told me this bc she knows that something is fishy in the relationship. 

I'm afraid that this will not get better, she is in love but for me this relationship is a big red flag. I have met the guy and he is sweet and kind but not talking that much. I don't think she would be lying about these things, and we seldom talk about our relationship until we have problems that are too big to handel ourselves. I love her and want her to be happy! What can I do? The guy is clearly in denial over his own actions and puts himself as a victim when she tells him about her feelings.

g6qiy2,I need advise please,"So it appears after the course of about a year. Friends and family set me up to start doing meth ( crazy I know) an in a pathetic and disgusting attempt to scare me away from drugs and alcohol ( I still need to be sober. Y'all fucks) have been brainwashing me to believe im hearing voices. During all this I'm not sure if they have dosed me with acid , ghb , meth an I dunno what else. I'm not sure if they even did it the thought was just put in my head. Anyway there are multitude of factors for this last year of abuse (sexual, mental, physical) and whatever else. My bitch mom decided I needed counseling because she decided she could brainwash me to basically be a monster because she's fucking insane.or got tricked by more insane people. Who fuckin knows. Throughout everything my ex had been helping her behind my back the whole time. All of the ""friends"" everyone I knew. Had been helping the entire time. Fortunately I remember everything unless I was so drugged up I couldn't remember. I'm working through everything finally and it's about time I find decent counsel and a lawyer. It's absolutely unreal and sounds insane. It's provable though. So begins the adventure of vindication in the name of morality , mentality , humanity , shining the light on disgusting people and so on. Oh and they have my phone Everytime I get a new one. They Trace the IP/MAC address I guess and ( my fault I didn't break ties) rig my phone. Through there brainwash I wanted to kill myself, ruin myself, disgusted by myself and so much more. Anyway it's time since the people tell the truth. What they did for the reasons is intolerable and unfathomable. I'm in a cult more or less.

g6sjjv,Random fucked up memory. Basically the only thing that I remember about my childhood.,"When I was 9 an old lady bought me an American girl doll. Her husband just died and all of her kids were grown, so she treated me as her grandchild. My mom told me to keep it on my doll bed, which was on the floor. My little brother went in my room and drew all over it with sharpie and cut her hair. I was crying.  I was so sad because I loved that doll. Then my parents found it.  The yelled and screamed at me. They beat me with 3 different thing. A belt, a paddle, and a baking spatula. They beat me so bad. out of all of the patches of childhood that I can’t remember, that is the one thing that I can remember the most vivid.  I remember every second of it.  They even hit my right foot. It was swollen and bruised for a week. Still have trouble with it to this day. The thing is, my little brother never got in trouble. Why? Because according to them,he was too young to know better. He may have been 4, but you should have a small concept of good and bad at that point. They never even talked to him. They never fussed at him. NOTHING. According to them, it way my fault because I didn’t keep it in a high place. If you remember earlier, I said that they told me to keep it on my dool bed. So they blamed me. A month ago, I brought this up to my mom, and she said that I was mistaken. She said that they never beat me. She said that she would never do that. But she did.

g6uulj,I am traumatized,"I am traumatized by my mother. 
I come to you today at 19 years old feeling the same sadness that has overtook me nearly one million times. It hurts. It chisels away more and more each time... and in some ways it allows for better things to grow. But I am not coming to you today in a motivational tone. It’s more so for me to be able to vent because I have nobody. 

I am a child of physical and verbal abuse. My mother is a domestic violence survivor. She was abused by her parents. I was taken by foster care when I was young. At the time I thought it was the worst situation, but looking back sometimes I feel that my mom getting me back was the mistake. No, no I’ll never tell her that. Sexual abuse vs. physical abuse amirite everyone. When my mom came back, she traded one poison for another and became a violent alcoholic. When someone you love hurts you, you separate the bad and good times almost into two different people. When my mother was drunk, when she had that sinister grin on her face, that wasn’t my mother. It helped me cope with having to live with her. Sometimes I lived with a monster, sometimes I lived with my mother. Depending on the weather, you never knew which you would get. 

When you’d start to hear the death metal music, or evanescence is what frightened me every time. A school night? She didn’t care. She wouldn’t take me to school and the bus didn’t come by because I lived out of district. When we got to my teen years, since she was finally able to provide a stable home and food that was enough. I am beyond grateful for this, as we had been homeless before, we’ve lived in the car, in a trailer, everywhere. I am blessed still, as many people are a lot less fortunate than I am. 

She’d just get so violent. She’d hurt both me and my grandmother. One time she beat me so bad and was so drunk that when I ran away, she didn’t even remember hurting me and went driving to my friends houses drunk, seeing if I had went there. She had hurt me so bad that I had to leave my phone, I had no shoes, nothing. I went and slept on the patio of a church nearby using clothes I found in the middle of the street to keep me warm. These are things that she doesn’t know nor does she care that she has caused me so much pain. She abused me until I was 16-17 years old until I finally started fighting back. I never wanted to hurt her. I could never justify doing what she did to me. I would always try to push her away and run. Because if she continued to fight me I’d hurt her. She has thrown glass at me, wine bottles at me. She has ripped my hair out, given me concussions, spit in my face, clawed me. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I’m so much like my dad. 

Well moving on, fast forward to 2019. I had been out of the house for 2 years. Living apart from my mom had done us good. We were able to build a decent relationship (although some may ask why I would want a relationship with my abuser anyways). I don’t know. I was invited to family Thanksgiving. Family gatherings are not really my cup of tea as my family is full of closet racists, rednecks, drug addicts, and bitchy women. In a way I still have love for them. My mom arrived to Thanksgiving after I did along with her boyfriend. We had a small Thanksgiving as we traveled to see just a few family members. My mother’s sister (my aunt) always have trouble getting along. I stressed to my mother not to drink, but what does lil ole me know? Not shit. And I’m immature. So they both drink too much. My mom and her boyfriend get into it and then my mom claims she was choked by her new boyfriend. I’m panicking with my grandmother trying to help everyone when my aunt comes charging at me trying to fight me. She breaks her own door and her children are screaming crying. I have scratches all down my face and neck and some hair pulled out. Nothing new. This is why I don’t come back. This is why I have to be done.

Fast forward to today. I tell my mother how I feel given my current life situations, and how she has screwed me over financially and put me in a hole. It gets thrown back in my face, as well as everything she has ever done for me. She’s told me many times that she is glad to have me, but the reason I’m here is because she lost her license and couldn’t get an abortion. What I don’t get is why she got me back from foster care. To continue to put me through abuse? My mental state is fucked up. I’m fragile, I feel like I walk on eggshells everywhere I go. I apologize all of the time. I have never had support for my dreams from my family. 

I guess that’s all I needed to say. I needed to tell somebody or something. I think I am finally letting go of that string, and I’ll be fine with her not talking to me if my happiness isn’t accepted by her. It hurts because she has put an illusion in my head that she loves me. She has shown me what toxic love is, but she is also getting better. It just sucks that once again I will be lost in the process.

this is something that has been on my mind for a while lately, and makes me really uncomfortable to think about it but I can't quite figure out if it was abuse or not.

so basically, my ex used to pressure me into sexual things that I didn't want to do. sometimes he would start touching me ""down there"" and I would protest and try to push him away but he would keep going and I would eventually give up and just let things happen because it was easier than exhausting myself by trying to get him to stop. the same thing happened with sex on a few occasions. there was also an occasion where we were having sex and I wanted to stop halfway through because I wasn't into it and he guilted me into letting him carry on.

g6zqdl,It's so difficult to share abuse stories,"I just wanted to say how difficult it is to share our abuse stories -- people always say to share whats in our mind and the troubles, but it is simply just too difficult for us to do so.

To close friends and trusted adults (im a child?) who may care : They simply dont know what to do to help us. They may empathise, but there's only so much they can empathise for. They cannot relate because they've not been in the same situation. Also, they may think we are exaggerating when we share because , yes, it is a much easier way out to relate to the story, than having to believe that someone close by is suffering from abuse, as they would not know how to help the person close by.

Also, people tend to judge our stories, or even us, based on our personalities. We're being objectified due to our stories, because simply no one understands. Now, we're at fault for sharing. I feel that viictimes shouldn't be judged based on our personalities outside to based it on how much abuse one can take. I have had teachers telling me that I am ""very cheerful"" and I am probably just being a negative person. And teachers still wonder why I am not comfortable with sharing teachers about my problems. I've had counsellors telling me my ""dad loves me"". He IS my abuser and thats not what I am fucking here for, to hear these nonsense. 

They like to putdown our stories by saying ""it isnt as bad as we think"". For example, they may share that they have the same thing, ""Yea, my dad also canes me!! Its alright, hes just being normal"". U know, thats not what i want to hear. I want to solve my problems also? And, trying to weigh down the abuse by normalizing it isnt something an abused wants to be heard of. That's like trying to tell an abused that they;re WRONG for feeling abused, because everyone experienced it too, and ITS NOT TAT BAD.

I dont blame any of them -- They're all just trying to help; but they are not experienced in it, and don't know how to help. Sometimes, the reason I share these stories, its simply because i want people to KNOW. I want them to Know whats going on in my life too, as a child. I used to be an abused who blames it on myself, a lot. I want to make a change in my own life, and get my father charged for being so abusive for 16 years of my life. But many times , I end up regretting sharing my own stories, because I always seem at fault now.

I believe that the best way an inexperienced listener can help an abused who is sharing their stories, is to LISTEN. As long as they listen, we feel better. We feel heard, we feel like there is something we can still hold on to -- maybe someoen can help us, or at least comfort us and make us feel better.

g70kor,"I want to share my story (molestation, anger issues, and depression). I’m scared, but I’m doing it for you guys. You are not alone.","Hi guys,

My name’s Phil, and I’m 18 years old male. I’ve never done anything like this before. But, I thought it could help at least one person (maybe even myself) so I’m going to give it a try. Here’s my story of my years long battle.

I would consider my life up until the age of four to be quite normal; I was good at making friends, I had a very childish “romance” with a girl at preschool, and I lived in a stable household. It was on my fourth birthday where my life started to tread downhill. My parents had invited my best friend from preschool over to my house for my birthday party. From what I remember, the party was quite swell. I had cake and such and such, typical party. After it was over, my best friend invited me to spend the night at his house. I begged my parents, and they conceded. I ate dinner there and we were soon sent to bed (if you find it hard to read about molestation, skip to the next paragraph. I’m going to be very frank about my experience). Now, before I continue, I must say that I still think about this night vividly on occasion 14 years after it happened, and it makes me sick to my stomach every time. It has become harder and harder to make out all the details with the passing years, but how it felt is still engraved into brain. It has made me feel like less of a man, and very much like a tool made to be used. Well here I go. After we entered our respective beds, my friend says he wanted to try something on me that his father had done to him. I agreed. I had absolutely no clue what he meant, but next thing I knew he had put himself into my bed and did exactly what he said he would do. The same thing his father had done to him. I refuse to go into more detail for both my and your sake. After this point, it was a blur. I remember telling my mother about it and that’s about it.

After that night I had never felt the same. 

A year passed and I had enter elementary school. I didn’t have the same ability I once had to make friends with other kids. This was the beginning of my ostracization. As the years increased, so did my weight. By the end of elementary school I weighed roughly 210lb. The increase continued into middle school where I hit a max, of I believe, 270lb. I hated myself, I was fat, friendless, and most importantly, loveless. At this point, my parents’ marriage was starting to show cracks. There was constant fighting. These fights primarily were a result of my half-sister who at the time was heroine addict (I believe she has now recovered, but I don’t know for sure). I started to grow angry at this time. Very angry. Angry at the world, my parents, and myself. I hated everything. I was very eager to start fights and to stick it to people. I remember physically assaulting a number of people that I would have considered friends because they caused me the slightest annoyance, specifically one boy, I hit multiple times. I have never said sorry to any of these people (if you happen to read this, I’m very sorry). I probably hurt them greatly and ruined their trust in others.

This anger lasted until high school where it turned into competitiveness. After developing this personality trait, I lost 100lb, which reinforced it. I had to win everything. If I didn’t, I would break down. I’ve famously punched many walls, leaving many dents. As you can probably imagine this wasn’t healthy. This level of competitiveness slowly turned into sadness. With everything I mentioned up until now: my inability to make friends, my anger, my competitiveness, and my unattractive physical appearance I was one of the most hated individuals within my school. My very complicated personality mixed with my standing with my peers lead to depression. I became very depressed during my junior year of high school. I was having very bad depressive episodes every night. It started to noticeably affect my school work (at this time I was fourth in my class out of 110), I felt like a I had to work even harder to maintain what I had, all I had, which was my grades. To make things worse, this is when my parents got divorced. To be frank, I didn’t cry, I didn’t care. After developing my weird personality, my parents had no value to me, but it still worsened my depression.

On a day during the November of 2018, I tried to kill myself (if you have a hard time reading about suicide, skip to the next paragraph). This is something, just like my molestation, I have a very hard time talking about, so I’m going to keep it brief. I had decided to live with my father after the divorce, and he had a 9mm in his bedroom closet. On a day that he was off on business, I decided I was going to do it. I didn’t even write a note, I didn’t want to be remembered, I wanted to be silent. I remember loading it and putting it to my head. I sat there, and I sat there. Eventually, my mind brought me to this girl who had be very kind to me over the last year and how sad she would be if this was the route I took. So I put the gun down, and I cried.

Now, a year and half later, here I am. I’m now on 20mg of Lexapro after my doctor noticed my depression. I still experience depressive episodes now and then (a lot more recently because of the coronavirus outbreak). I’m now getting prepared to go to my dream college, and I feel like I have some semblance of control in my life. There is a lot I didn’t talk about in this, including my experiences with alcohol abuse and my personal relationship with the girl that in essence stopped my suicide, but I didn’t want to make this too long. Now that all is pretty much said and done, what advice can I give? 

-Live for the dreams you’ve yet to see materialize.

-Live for the people you haven’t met that you’ll make smile.

-And, given the aforementioned, live the life you want. Live the dreams *you* want, and make the people *you* want to smile. 

I hope this shows at least one person that they are not alone. If you think no one cares about your situation, I do. Thanks for reading this.

If you want to reach out to me and ask questions, feel free. Thanks again for reading this.

g70tpw,I'm stupid but I genuinely can't tell whether this is abuse.,"What's embarrassing about this situation is that I am 16, very oversensitive and cannot stand up for myself.

I have an older sister who often hits/punches me, I never do this to her, and when she does it it seems like she's joking around. A couple of times in the past, she's hit me with objects such as wooden boards, and/or thrown stuff at me. Sometimes I cry and she mocks me for it. 

We were close when we were younger so I do not know why she's mean to me now. Sometimes, I get bruises from her punching me, but I don't think she intends to hurt me. My other family sees this happen and do not mind, although if my mom sees that I am in pain she'll half-heatedly tell my sister to stop.

I was brought up with the idea that it is normal for siblings to fight at times, but most of the time she just hits me for her entertainment. To what extent is this  sibling rivalry or whatever?

g714xg,Abused by our babysitter,"[24/M] I was sexually abused by our babysitter

I have never said this out loud or written anything about this before. Hopefully this will help me a little bit. 24/M, from Scandinavia.. (you know.. sorry about my English.)

The earliest I can remember I was sitting in my sister’s room (2 years younger than me) with our babysitter and she had no underwear on. 

Our babysitter was our neighbours daughter, 6 years older than me. Her family was a part of my family growing up. We did everything together. Her younger brothers was my (and my sister’s) two bestfriends growing up.

I remember some of the things happening that day and events from other days, so I know it happened more than one time. It is atleast 15 years ago but I still can not get myself to ask if my sister remembers anything or tell anyone about it. I think it is one of the reason I have anxiety and depression today.

I do not want to talk to anyone because I am ashamed. I do not want to go to a therapist ‘because I am from one of the Nordic countries, my life is as good as it can get’.",p4ssionated,2020-04-23 20:32:44,3,208,29.8,40.5,95.6,5.37,13,18.75,91.83,59.62,24.04,16.35,11.54,2.88,0.48,1.44,0,7.69,3.37,13.94,9.62,3.37,6.25,2.4,17.79,5.77,5.29,0,4.33,1.92,3.85,0.96,2.88,0.96,0.96,0.96,13.46,3.37,0.96,3.37,0.48,14.42,3.37,1.44,1.92,4.33,0.96,5.29,0.96,0,0.96,0,1.44,0,0.96,0.48,0,10.1,7.21,0,1.92,1.44,0,6.73,11.54,0.96,14.42,1.44,5.29,7.69,0.48,0.96,1.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.83,8.17,1.92,0,0,0,0,0,0.48,1.44,2.88,1.92

g73tvn,I just found out my abuser was arrested a few years back,"I was groomed when I was 11-12. It's been nearly 14 years since it happened. I never really thought much of it for a few reasons. The main reason being was that I had lied about my age at the time, posing as a 16 y/o. It was a very elaborate lie, and was during a time when webcams weren't common use. It was entirely online, through MSN. Up until this day I always felt at fault, but at the same time, he didnt seem shocked when I told him I had lied about my age.

About about year ago, he contacted me via facebook through a friend of mine. I didnt really think much of it, but the guilt I had made me respond with an apology. I ghosted him after he started asking if my feelings for him were real back then. It freaked me out that he even asked that. 

It's a part of my life that I actively try to forget. It makes me feel gross, especially sexually. He stole my innocence at such a young age, which has left lifelong emotional damage that therapy will never help.

I looked up his name recently, out of curiosity, and have found out he has a previous arrest for sexual assault of a child. This incident happened a few years back. I am freaking out right now. He messaged me last year so he clearly got away with whatever happened.

I'm not from his Country so theres not much I can do as far as I know, but damn I feel fucking horrible for never speaking up. I genuinely thought it was my fault because of how it happened. He knew all along

g76rkn,Consequences,"Hi.

I just want to share that I'm dealing with great consequences of abuse.

It's been hard lately. I can't trust poeple at all. I'm constantly running away from everything, focusing only on work 24/7 as the idea of having more freedom helps me sleep.

I am a total recluse. I don't interact or go outside anymore. 

I was under domestic abuse for months and ever since I went from a cheerful go happy person to a recluse, lost tremendous weight, having extreme trust issues. 

I am in a new home now but I still have consequences. I live very frugally and minimally just to avoid contact with anyone. It hurts me. 

I hope it gets better after long isolation from the cause. 

Anyone can see that I've been struggling. I put on a hard face and swallow all the pain.  I fear taking help from people because I think they will abuse me.

I lost so much.

So much of myself.",CGVeteran,2020-04-24 04:29:47,0,164,45.42,23.22,89.9,16.98,9.11,15.24,93.29,55.49,18.9,13.41,12.8,0,0,0,0.61,5.49,4.88,14.02,9.15,6.71,5.49,1.22,17.68,6.71,2.44,0,1.22,3.66,12.8,6.1,6.71,1.83,1.83,2.44,8.54,0,0.61,0,0,12.2,1.22,3.66,1.22,2.44,3.05,1.83,3.66,0.61,0,3.05,3.66,1.22,1.22,0,1.22,12.2,3.05,2.44,1.83,2.44,3.66,3.66,14.63,1.22,14.02,3.05,4.88,6.1,0.61,0.61,1.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.46,10.37,1.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.66,0,0.61

g77247,So I just logged on to reddit this morning because I felt like I needed to explode (my metaphor for feelings of a personal urgency and need to vent) and the first post I saw was about an angry father &amp; I pretty much used it to face my feelings this morning and fact I needed to vent. It ended up good,"I am so sorry you are dealing with this. I'm just curious but are you a man or woman? Truthfully I am glad I logged on and this was the first post that I saw. I am feeling a little anxious and somewhat sad this morning. I have been working on my emotional health and what I have come to discover to be ""c-ptsd"" and the resulting emotional flashbacks.

I think the hardest thing about these processes and experiences... is that it is an everyday thing. I guess what hurts the most is the feeling of ""let down"" when, usually, by the end of the day I am feeling happy, achieved and hopeful (after having worked passionately all day reading the books I love, and creating and continuously updating and posting on my youtube channel...) that when I wake up in the morning, I start off excited and hopeful to restart my day.

But everyday, about an hour or so in the feeling of dread begins to sink in... The realization that I am not now ""informed and cured"" but rather I will be revisiting these harmful memories and hurtful experiences... again and again...

It really is an inspiring process! One that writing this now, I realize I should only be more and more grateful for! I guess the pain just sometimes comes from the realization that it is not all over. Every day I will be flashing back to memories that hurt the worst. Feelings that I deny the best. And emotions I never asked for or wanted or ever really even dreamed that I would have to feel.

...Anyway sorry for the dramatics!! lol this was more for me than for you (hahaha! :P) But I figured since you had experiences with an angry (apparently also violent... I am so sorry!) father... that you might possibly relate?

I dont really associate with having been a victim of physical abuse but I am wondering now if this is something that I actually need to reacknowledge and release....

I guess some of the feelings of sorrow comes from the fact that I have already written about these feelings once now... and I suppose I had that sort of childlike dream that having acknowledged them once would be enough... and that i ""faced it"" and it was all going to go away now!

Regardless, writing this now is I think what is going to really help me get through. I am thinking I am going to copy and paste this and apply it to maybe my own post or some other forums as well. I'd be interested in hearing other peoples responses to this and hopefully maybe also hear and/or offer their support! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 It sounds so stupid but stuff like this, it really just helps so much to know that we are not all actually alone!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

Please let me know if you relate or have any experiences similar. I think because I have been ""hardly"" physically abused... I always wonder if maybe I am just weak or somehow brought it on myself or like maybe it is just my fault... :'( I know this is not true but you know, you see football players and boxers and guys who take serious and repeated punches to the face and they make it... it seems anyway... appearing remotely unscathed...

And here I've been the victim of physical violence maybe only once or twice in my life and it seems like every morning and I am twitching and flashing back at the fear of coming forward about this :''''( I know that this is all for God's purpose and that acknowledging these facts and feelings will only help make me stronger so that I too can help people like myself and who have had it much much worse.

I would like to think that I am now releasing these feelings and that tomorrow will bring an easier, and more progressive day! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I know that I believe that everyday is going to bring a morning and emotional flashback that is just EVEN A LITTLE bit easier and that oneday I am going to get through this completely!!!

Ahh anyway I guess this is a prayer at this point. So thank you to loving and grateful higher power. That I hope to fully and completely embrace as my new and eternally loving and transformed self! (lmao...??!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3)

Amen...??? XD XD XD :D :D :D but on a serious note it just felt really good to write this lmao...

thanks for being here guys!!! XD :P &lt;3 &lt;3&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 and thanks for reading!!! :P ;P &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 :) :) :D

g7869t,Who to call for a welfare check on a family that might be having a rough time?,"Are there any agencies - other than CPS or the cops - that would do a welfare check on families? (This is my basic question, feel free to skip any of the background details below although it might help to give a little more information about what my specific need is.)

I have a family member who has been showing signs of extreme depression on social media. She is a single mom of three. Two of the kids are living with her. She has an extremely limited support system and had recently cut ties to her only close family member. One of the children living with her has ODD and ADHD. He used to get a lot of support through school, but obviously less so now. The other child with her is under a year old. She has been diagnosed as manic depressive and also has Borderline Personality Disorder. Basically, her life circumstances, helped by COVID isolation, would put just about anyone in a really dark spot. 

I'm worried because CPS has been involved in her home in the past. The house had been declared an unsanitary living space and there was strong evidence of physical abuse. Similarly, it happened at a time when she was overwhelmed and isolated.

I am worried for the safetly of the two kids who are living with her, but have no direct evidence of abuse or neglect, I am just connecting the dots between former patterns of behavior and her current apparent state of mind. I also don't think that CPS is the best option right now; she clearly needs *help* not an investigation. So are there any other agencies that would serve this function? 

I should note that I am absolutely not a person who can check up on her. Anything I did would be seen as combative and threatening. (I have never threatened her, nor would I, but I did make records and produce evidence of her abuse to CPS during their last investigation.) I also live about 4 hours away from her.",RoastbeeHead,2020-04-24 06:15:16,3,356,47.26,59.99,7.51,2.81,16.18,17.7,90.17,58.71,14.61,9.27,3.93,0,0,5.06,0.28,5.34,7.3,13.2,12.92,6.46,6.74,1.69,17.98,5.62,2.53,1.69,1.69,1.97,5.34,1.4,3.93,1.4,1.4,1.69,12.08,1.4,0,5.06,0.28,14.61,2.25,1.12,2.53,3.65,1.97,3.93,1.4,0.84,0,0.56,2.25,0,2.25,0,0,5.9,2.53,0.56,3.37,0.56,0.56,4.49,11.24,0.56,9.83,0.56,5.06,4.21,2.25,1.12,1.69,0.84,0,0,0.28,0,0,0.28,0,0,12.08,5.34,2.81,0,0.28,0.84,0,0.56,0,0.56,1.12,0.56

g7akkl,My child’s father is dangerous,"My child’s (2M) father (23M) is extremely toxic and abusive. I left him over a year ago because of his mental and physical abuse. I’m now in a great relationship and very happy. But I am fearing for my child’s safety when he is with his father. He sees him every other weekend, we had custody agreements written up by a lawyer right after our separation. My reason for being so fearful is because I have recently learned that he has been terribly abusing his live in girlfriend. A few months ago he caused them to crash their car because he grabbed the steering wheel from her out of anger. They rolled three times and she had two broken legs, punctured lung, concussion, and a broken wrist. She was also pregnant with his child at the time and miscarried. I found out last night from a family member of the girlfriend that the abuse has only gotten worse and worse. She’s currently pregnant again with his child. A couple nights ago they were into an argument and he punched her in the stomach. He no longer allows her to speak to her family after this incident. I am terrified that he is going to turn his aggression on my son. I don’t know what to do or if there is anything I can do. I fear for this girl and her unborn baby, not only my child. She is too scared of him to press charges and is still in a relationship with him.

g7d5z6,Giving your all to someone,"married a guy who I thought was the love of my life. Our marriage has been nothing but unhappiness. The guy I married is very smart. His IQ is above average and a expert at everything which was always sorta crazy to me, and he is very confident and sociable.
 I'm complete opposite though and never understood why he’d go for a girl like me who is far from book smart.  I'm really shy, a bit insecure, mature, and a huge heart, &amp; school has always been hard for me. We are both the same age (21) so we're pretty young. We had good times but a lot more bad, he could be very sweet and encouraging but it didn't feel like he still cared enough about me or value me whatsoever. 
After 2 1/2 months of being married things got worse. I started to get depressed and really didn’t feel like myself. It started out by him never making time for me. Which he never really has. I was fooled. He only wanted to play video games all day and night or all night after work (he owned his own business so had his own hours sometimes.). I felt really alone.. The only time he made with me was when dinner was made and he'd eat with me. 
I would express/communicat to him ALL the time how I felt and really wanted to do more things together or just like spend quality time at home watching a movie or go to church but he would always say ""Why do we have to be doing something to spend time together, we are in the same room
 you can play video games with me"" and he would get very annoyed with me and then he would get mad because I didn't like that idea then start to just ignore me..and then it would turn into fights. He also has a porn addiction and that destroyed my self esteem. I wasn't allowed to ask how he was doing in his recovery because it would ""sabotage"" his progress. 
We didn't have much of a sex life in the beginning of our marriage as well. I would want to have sex with him because I mean we waited till marriage and now that we are married that is something I enjoyed with him but he would always say no and I'd get really hurt because it made me feel as if I wasn't good enough and he already jerked off to porn. His excuse was he had a lower sex drive than me. He didn't care to do anything with me. I'd get upset being constantly told ""NO"", ""maybe"" ""too tired"" and he would say ""If you stop whining and getting upset with me I'd feel like it"" Those words would hurt me and he would say ""Go cry about it"".
I felt so alone and it led me to get very paranoid and feel unworthy, and depressed. Sometimes I'd get anxiety coming home because I didn't know what mood or fight was going to happen. He could be caring or he could he would be careless. I also knew he had probably been watching porn since I wasn't home. Even when i was home he would do it in the bathroom. I'd come home and the bedroom door would be locked to just be away from me.
 He never communicated to me right. I started to begin hating myself. I started to think why can't I be happy why is nothing working? He made me feel like i was going crazy, and I would just yell, sob, and thought so much about how I wish i could just die which is very unlike me. 
Never felt that I was a priority to him definitely never came first as his wife. He would be very controlling on certain things. Whenever I'd leave home and stay at my grandparents cause of a bad fight...he would shut my phone off. One time he set up parental controls on it or something and just monitored my phone and look at all my history and found stuff I had posted on reddit on abusive relationships group and he got upset and called me a malicious liar. 
I was furious because I'm far from a liar but he made me believe i was delusional. He would do a lot of things a gas lighter does too. He has questioned my sanity, stone walled me A LOT, and made me question my memory. I felt like I was unable to feel or think anything. I had completely lost myself. I probably left him 10 times for 2-3 days but I always came back. That is so unhealthy.  He'd always say he didn't want to lose me, but then why would he ignore me and tell me how irrational I am, and never give the attention I needed. He would always get pissed when I asked him for reassurance because he didn't like spending time ""repeating"" him self. He's say why don't you just trust me? 
 he sent this long message to try and make me feel better because I was questioning whether he cherished me because of how insecure he made ne and he said at the end of message""Now there....I just spent another huge chunk of my time writing this to you, and i don't want you asking again"" that made me upset and i forgot what i said but I was basically like ""Sorry you had to spend a chunk of your time for your wife"" and he called me a cunt, and to go choke on a chainsaw. Now I'm sure he was stressed (He had a lot of clients on his back at the time) but nothing new.
Eventually in our marriage he never would say sorry for anything. He never cared about how he would hurt my feelings. He also didn't like my mom. My mom can be pretty narcissistic but she is the only parent I have and I try to keep a relationship with her even though it is hard for us to get along. I didn't want to drop her out of my life completely but he would influence me in a way and try to tell me it's not good for me to hang with her bc she just upsets me. He would also make me feel like I was mentally ill. He told me that he thinks I have BPD which is Borderline Personality Disorder. I am not even diagnosed though and his counselor even thought so but his counselor only has heard what he had to say and his side of the story. 

I started to believe I was and wanted to just die everyday. I would never commit suicide but I'd wish. The emotional pain was too much. Three weeks ago he told me ""I'm not progressing in life"". Being told that and also being told about a disorder That I may have ...I just lost myself even more he acted like he knew me more than I knew myself and he was good at words and explaining things. Also, one time we got in a big fight and i felt out of control I kept sobbing and I just started cutting my thighs. I couldn't cope at all. I hate so much that I did that because I never understood why people do that. I never have been a self harmer either. I left him again after that fight it had to do with him changing the computer password and looking at pornography again and he said things that just made me finally lose it. he just put earphones in to block me out. I left and told him I wanted a divorce....It's heartbreaking because I still love him. 
I don't think it's healthy for me to be with him. I don't feel like myself with him, I keep second guessing and feeling like it is all my fault but at the same time I don't think he can ever be willing to change. I get doubtful and think it's all my fault a lot..but I still know I deserve more than this and I can't just settle. He brought the worst out of me. If you read all this wow haha thank you cause it's a lot. Does anybody know what i'm going through or been through something similar?",throwawaycp97,2020-04-24 10:59:28,7,1417,6.28,42.44,49.26,5.86,18.4,12.07,96.4,63.87,24.06,19.27,10.94,0.92,0.78,6.63,0,4.8,3.32,10.52,11.86,8.12,9.32,2.89,24.28,3.95,2.54,1.98,0.85,2.12,7.48,2.75,4.59,0.92,1.27,1.41,14.75,1.13,0.14,0.71,6.49,19.05,3.32,3.39,3.11,3.18,2.96,4.38,3.32,0.42,1.13,1.69,1.98,0.21,0.78,0.49,0.28,7.06,2.89,1.06,1.2,1.48,0.78,8.4,11.57,0.85,12,1.62,4.16,6.42,0.78,0.78,0.71,0.42,0.07,0.21,0.42,0.14,0.21,0,0.07,0,13.83,6.56,1.41,0,0.07,0.21,0,0.07,1.55,3.32,0.42,0.21

g7h1p7,I just got broken up with three days ago.. the pain is still there lingering,"I’ll admit there would be days where he was really mean to me.. I mean cussing and yelling at me in front of his family. telling me if guys kept looking at me, he’d kill both of us. I even went to work with him one day, I was sitting down with my legs crossed scrolling through Instagram. a man came in and I guess he was looking at me so my ex came up to me and kicked my leg really hard. I was confused so I just looked at him then looked around because I figured it was an accident. then once the man left my ex got in my face and said “try not to show your goods to every man that walks in here”. when we’d go to Walmart together and men would walk by staring at me he’d tell me “you love that attention don’t you? why don’t you cover yourself up more so you don’t look like a whore” then he’d shove his jacket at me. I don’t know if he was a narcissist or just a simple abuser but there would be days he was really nice, bringing me food in bed, making sure I’m comfortable around his friends, cuddling me til I fell asleep.. and those are the moments I really miss. I can’t stop thinking about the good memories when I should be thinking about the bad. we were just talking about moving in together then two days later he ended things abruptly. with no goodbye. he blocked me and deleted our photos from everything then re added girls he use to have a thing with. he did this same thing last summer then 3weeks later unblocked me and begged me back. I was dumb enough to take him back but the abuse only became worse and for some reason I feel like if he were to come back right now.. I’d take him back again..

g7izoq,My brothers behaviour is breaking my family apart,"For some context...
I am a 17 y/o female
My brother is 16 yrs

My brother has been sort of abusing my parents in every way for the last couple of years, starting at around 12, and been messing with me mentally or emotionally (maybe both?) since we were really young. In the last while he’s gotten a lot more aggressive with my parents and he’s been fighting with people since he started secondary school (which he dropped out of at 14) 
Even more recently, (warning this might be a bit graphic to some people!) He attacked a man in town and jumped on his head. I was pretty worried when he told me this because he’s currently sleeping in the room next to me for the next few days (maybe even weeks).
He has been taken in by multiple organisations, centres for kids with behavioural issues, gone through teen rehab programs, and he’s been kicked out of all of them. The last option we had sort of crumbled with this whole CoronaVirus situation (he spat in the faces of the staff which... obviously is not cool and they took it very seriously considering the current situation)

I was recently told that my dad might be moving out of our family home of 13 years to move in with my brother to keep me and my mom safe.
I haven’t lived with my brother for around two years now. So him not living with us wouldn’t be a problem for me. My dad is just my best friend and I don’t want him to leave me. 

I know that this won’t stop him from coming back to look for and steal money from us. He has no problems with breaking windows or knocking down doors.

g7k0mr,Moving out of my abusive household..,"So, I (22f), East Indian , I’ve had to deal with my alcoholic father with anger issues my whole life. He used to be physically abusive (and sometimes still is) but now he’s more so emotionally abusive (and this only gets worse when he drinks, which is every night, and the next day he doesn’t remember the nasty things he says to me and my family).

My dad is narcissistic, and always thinks he’s right. When I was in high school, he was abusive at home and my mom was in a mental institution because she was severely depressed (after years Of putting up with him). I am the oldest sibling (there’s a huge age gap between me and my brothers) so I started talking back to him, and would call the cops when he hit me or my mom. Eventually, I tried to run away from home and started rebelling (i.e. drinking with friends) because I felt like I was trapped. When I would call the cops on him, my dad made me look like the bad guy for bringing attention and shame to our family and my extended family would also look at me like I was the bad guy. They defended my dads ways “that’s just his nature, that’s just how he is, don’t talk back to him”. But i had to stick up for my family. At the end of the day, my extended family does not live with us and only hear parts of the story he wants to tell them.

Anyways, eventually I got put In foster care because child protective services realized I couldn’t be in his custody (he never got mad at my brothers because they were too young to stick up to him but he still did other things like drive under the influence with them in the car). Despite all of this, despite being arrested numerous times for domestic abuse, and hitting me, getting me taken away, he did not quit drinking or get help. He just made me look like the villain and when I would tell my family I was depressed cuz of him, they thought I was seeking attention. 

When I turned 18, I decided to move back in with my parents because of my mom and siblings. It was not easy as he still had not changed. However, I started working full time and going to school to stay out of the house as much as possible. My siblings were getting old enough to stick up to him too. 

Fast forward to today, Being at home with him during COVID has made me realize that the only reason we have been ok living with each other is because I would
Avoid him, which isn’t healthy because at the end of the day, he’s still the same. The other night, he literally said “suck my d***” to me and didn’t remember saying it the next day. He does help me financially but he ALWAYS uses it against me whenever he gets the chance and is very controlling and manipulative (I.e. “if you’re not home by 11pm I’m taking the car away from you).

I really want to move out but my mom keeps guilt tripping me, my brothers dont agree with me and think I’m overreacting, and my dad said if I move out, I’m “dead to him and his whole family” and he also thinks I’m moving out to be closer to my boyfriend and has made me mom think the same, she thinks I’m just using his anger outbursts as an excuse. Of course I want to be closer to my boyfriend (he lives 2 hours away) but that’s not the reason why I want and need to leave! I need to leave because of my mental health.

g7k63g,Brother might be abusive,"For some context...
I am a 17 y/o female
My brother is 16 yrs

My brother has been sort of abusing my parents in every way for the last couple of years, starting at around 12, and been messing with me mentally or emotionally (maybe both?) since we were really young. In the last while he’s gotten a lot more aggressive with my parents and he’s been fighting with people since he started secondary school (which he dropped out of at 14) 
Even more recently, (warning this might be a bit graphic to some people!) He attacked a man in town and jumped on his head. I was pretty worried when he told me this because he’s currently sleeping in the room next to me for the next few days (maybe even weeks).
He has been taken in by multiple organisations, centres for kids with behavioural issues, gone through teen rehab programs, and he’s been kicked out of all of them. The last option we had sort of crumbled with this whole CoronaVirus situation (he spat in the faces of the staff which... obviously is not cool and they took it very seriously considering the current situation)

I was recently told that my dad might be moving out of our family home of 13 years to move in with my brother to keep me and my mom safe.
I haven’t lived with my brother for around two years now. So him not living with us wouldn’t be a problem for me. My dad is just my best friend and I don’t want him to leave me. 

I know that this won’t stop him from coming back to look for and steal money from us. He has no problems with breaking windows or knocking down doors. I feel really lost because I’m his big sister and I feel like a lot of this could’ve been stopped sooner if I’d have known how bad it would’ve gotten.",lolly-bips,2020-04-24 17:37:43,1,330,50.12,60.76,55.41,2.23,20.62,15.76,93.64,58.18,18.18,14.85,7.88,1.52,0,4.85,0.61,3.33,4.24,16.67,11.21,4.85,5.45,2.12,19.7,5.15,2.12,1.21,1.82,4.24,5.15,1.21,3.94,0.3,1.52,0.3,13.64,3.64,0.3,0.91,7.27,12.12,1.52,1.52,2.12,4.85,0.91,2.42,1.52,0.61,0,0.91,2.12,1.21,0.91,0,0,10.3,4.55,0.61,1.82,1.82,2.12,8.18,9.09,1.82,16.97,2.12,7.27,7.88,0.91,0.3,1.52,0.3,0,0,0.61,0,0.3,0.3,0,0,14.55,5.15,1.82,0,0,0.3,0.3,0,0,3.64,3.03,0.3

g7lzhn,Where did you go when you had no where to go?,"Physically, emotionally... honestly to where ever or whomever, I guess. I feel very alone right now. 

I (21F) ask because I feel trapped and so overwhelmingly uncertain. In almost every single way. I’ve never felt at home, at home. Even from when I was young and the abuse wasn’t physical. 

Like many, this SIP ordinance brought to a brighter light that I have an abusive father. I’ve been making excuses for him my entire life, but he really is a damaged man. He has had an extremely shitty life (a lot of people in his life have died recently, he had a spinal surgery in the past couple years that makes him unable to play soccer which is his one true passion, etc.). I feel so deeply for him and empathize with his pain as a person. In my search for answers and guidance, I am trying to see him as a person instead someone who is responsible for my upbringing. 

However, like his life, the abuse, just keeps getting “worse”.  Yet, he has no desire to seek help. My mom and his sister have recommended therapy (that he refuses). They’ve discussed extended vacations and breaks from his job, and they could financially cover him so he doesn’t have to work and get the help he needs. Nothing works or catches his interest, nor is he searching or reaching out for any help. My mom is always the initiator when it comes to helping him, and I can see her slowly getting sick of it. Also to put into context, a couple of months ago because the abuse started to get worse and before the SIP, my mom and I talked about how to send him away to his sisters in a different country or how to go about a divorce. We’ve never had conversations like this before but now that I’m more of an adult, we’ve been able to really talk about it. 
 
The abuse and manipulation has been going on for almost my whole life, more recently in the past couple years. I think I’m freaking out more than usual because I really realized that I can’t tolerate it anymore and it’s happening way more often. What usually happens is something “triggers” him (MANY THINGS TRIGGER HIM), and he has an outburst. I refer to them as his episodes. He has gotten like this in public spaces and parking lots, at home, and at work. 

To paint a picture, he usually starts by getting overwhelmed or too emotional about something that doesn’t go his way, if anyone is rude to him in any degree, or something inconveniences him. He then will politely and calmly let everyone around him not that he is “starting to feel weird”. He’ll first throw whatever he has in his hands, and the move around the location or room to start destroying everything in sight. The only way is to physical restrain him or hide, until it’s over. His episodes also include screaming, cursing, uncontrollable sobbing, yelling for his mom (RIP who left us in 2019), threatening to kill himself and others, threatening to drive off and kill himself and others, describing to us about how much he wants to die, hitting his head against a wall or on the floor if he’s already collapsed by then, grabbing the people around him, etc. 

These episodes also vary in content. Sometimes it’s everything I listed, sometimes only some of them. They can be short or long. I can’t even put into words what kind of experience it is to watch these episodes happen. Anyways, these episodes used to only happen once in awhile. When I was younger, I have a memory of it happening maybe once or twice. In the past maybe 2-3 years, I can’t give an estimate about how many these happened, bigger and smaller. I also don’t know how many times this happened when I am not physically there, and it’s just my mom or when he decides to be a public nuisance by himself.

Since the start of April, he’s had 2 or 3. On top of his usual episode, earlier this week, he even grabbed a screw driver and swung it over his head to kill himself. Another new happening was that my mom screamed for me: “[My name] come and help me. Call 911 he’s crazy and trying to kill me. Help me [my name].” I ran and the first thing I saw was my dad completely overpowering my mom. (SN: my mom is 115 pounds and 5 feet tall. She also had BRAIN SURGERY in January. Wtf is wrong with this man.) 

I have these images burned into my memory. This was the also the first time I truly feel unsafe and never wanted anything more but to leave. 


Whew, okay. ANYWAYS. I keep trying to get my mom to leave with me, but she won’t. She tells me she’s okay and that she wants to figure it out, and will not kick him out. I’ve begged her to kick him out. I showed her the marks he made on my skin. I screamed at her to remind her that he also hurt her and even tried to relive some of those moments of that fight/episode with her. I sobbed and begged for her to get him out. This stubborn ass woman will not budge. 

It’s been a couple days since this happens. 
ATM, we are all “co existing”. I text my mom, but I stay in my locked room or go out and stay in my car parked somewhere else. I haven’t spoken to my dad since. According to my mom, they also have no spoken. All I know is that she plans on staying. 

I finally caved and called my one of my older brothers yesterday. We had an emotional breakthrough and he came to the “conclusion” that I just need to get the fuck out, like all my older siblings have. I’m the youngest and last to leave. He dished out a lot of pills that were hard for me to swallow. I feel way better after that conversation though. 

I’ve tolerated some actions my entire life and understand that I can’t stay here. But this fucking shelter in place is physically making me stay. I feel extra frustrated with this situation too because it’s so hard to not be here. 

And please don’t get me wrong, I definitely understand that I do not have it as bad as many people. In fact, I have many happy memories from my childhood, but I feel like I may be becoming a bit delusional and my judgement is being clouded again. Since it’s not as bad as other people, and my mom, who is dealing with the worst of it and isn’t seeming phased by any of it, why am I freaking out? (SN: I have intense anxiety, lol.) 

I guess my questions are:

Am I overreacting? Is this something that people live with and I should just suck it up? I genuinely can’t tell. First off, I’m a pretty anti-conflict person. I don’t get into many big fights. I’m not an instigator and am usually passive aggressive (hate myself for that), but will communicate when confronted. Am I too soft? I haven’t ever experienced fighting like this outside the family. Every conflict in my life dulls in comparison, but doesn’t everyone have their own shit? 

If I’m not overreacting, where should I go? Realistically? I have a friend who I crashed with on the first night and spent the days with already for the past couple days, but I feel deeply burdensome to do so. Personally, it just makes me feel worse that someone has to take care of me and that I have to explain myself. Anyone else in a similar situation and feel similarly? Where did you go?  

Should I twiddle my thumbs and continue to hide out until I can physically get out? Do I tip toe and continue to tolerate this abuse? Is it worth it to be logistical and figure it out slowly or should I leave ASAP? How do I leave ASAP? 

Follow up question, if I were to leave, how do you start a new life somewhere else? Everything in my life is here, unfortunately. My job, my animals, and all my friends. I grew up here. I don’t even know where to go. My brother mentioned that I need to go far away, and I agree. He said that if anything happened and I got a phone call and I was in distance to come, I would. And I totally would. So that is also a certainty: if I were to leave, I need to go far away. Where the fuck do I go? Does anyone have any successful “picked up and left completely to start over” stories? 

And I guess even further questions for people who have gone through a similar situation and made it out, how do you forgive yourself for leaving a loved one behind? Do you ever? How do I even begin processing the feeling of leaving my mom behind with her abusive husband? 

And for those of you who made it out and reached the end of the abusive tunnel, is it worth it? Was leaving worth it? How did you do it? Please give me some hope. I feel stuck at the half way point of this damn toilet paper roll of hell. 

Holy bejesus. Thank you if you made it this far, and for being compassionate enough to hear me out.

This is not the first time, but he kept telling me how he’s going to murder me. I have a lot of video evidence of him hitting me and mumbling to himself about how he is going to kill me. I talked to my grandmother and told her how he’s been beating me my whole life and how I’ve been too scared to say anything and she said: “well, just deal with it. He hits all of his daughters you aren’t special”, and then she said, “if you don’t like it there then you should leave”. I’m 16 years old. I don’t have any very dependable friends. I don’t have my drivers license. Where the fuck am I going to go. My little brother (12) lives here too and so does my older brother, (19). I’m convinced that the they are both brainwashed into thinking my “father 🤮 “ is a good person. They both seem to hate me and they always think that I am the one at fault, and that I am the one who is in the wrong. My grandmother is seriously an evil fucking witch. She’s like 80 years old and she’s been sticking up for her abusive son (my “dad” 🤮) her entire life.

My parents got CPS called on them for strangling my sisters too before. I saw that he strangled them with my own two eyes...I was probably around 8 years old. But my mother is a stupid brainless woman  who sticks up for her husband that not only abuses me, but also has abused my two older sisters.

We live in the same apartment, and arguing has gotten out of line. I have gotten a black eye, scratches, I currently have a bruised ass cheek. I have never put my hand on her, ever. She calls me lazy, and says I don’t cook or clean..But I actually do. I cook, I clean, I do laundry, I bathe our son, I help our daughter with hwk every day because I’m great at math and have a bachelors degree. She has a criminal record, and has anger problems. She was abused growing up by her mother, physical and verbal. 

One thing I can say is she is great at apologizing days after, but today, it was on a different level. She said she would stab me if I said one more word, she was holding a knife making steak while I was making rice. I shut up and she kicked my hard on my ass, in front of our daughter. 

I would leave, she has given me the boot sooooooo many times, the apartment is under her name. But, I’m thinking about my son. I don’t know what would happen since I help pay rent, bills, groceries. I don’t want my son to suffer. He is currently getting tested for autism. I don’t want to leave. Is it right if I stay? Am I dumb? 

I have no one to talk to. She gets upset when I talk to my mom. I always think it’s because she’s jealous of how I was brought up. She says I’m a mommas boy, because I moved out so late. But in reality, I haven’t seen my mom in soooo long. I have been disconnected from my parents and my sisters and cousins.. she still says I put them first though. Which I could never understand. I do so much for my immediate family. 

So here I am on reddit. I’m currently in bed with my son I put to bed. And she is in the living room watching a Netflix movie with her daughter. Every argument is like this. At least once a week.

TW: Sexual actions, possible manipulation
(Please let me know if I should tag NSFW.) 

TL:DR at bottom. It'll be a long read, so I apologize for that. I just want to make a valid testimony and also vent it out.


Recently I was thinking about my first boyfriend. 

We were both 13 at the time we started dating, but he was almost fully sexually developed. I had the features that signified I was going through puberty, (breasts.) but I was nowhere near sexually matured. I received no pleasure from touching myself and was not able to orgasm.

It all started when we were video calling. We were still friends at the time of the call. For God knows what reason, he offered to show me his penis. I said no. I had no desire to see that part of him and said it would be awkward aswell. 

He said he didn't think it would be awkward and whipped it out. I felt a little uncomfortable, but not an alarming amount, just felt it was a bit awkward. 

Then he started to ask me to flash him. I didn't want to. He said since he showed his penis, it was only fair I showed him my breasts. I can't remember exactly what words he used to pressure me, but he ended up cracking me. 

I showed him for a few seconds, before turning off my camera in a panic. I felt violated, exposed and dirty. I was struggling not to cry. I didn't tell him about any of that. I'm not sure why I didn't. I wished I did. 

He showered me with compliments and love. I was very affection starved from my household and environment, so I sucked it all up gratefully. He was so kind to me. So when he asked me out, I felt no reason to say no.

He said his parents checked his phone, so he couldn't access adult sites, like pornhub. He asked me to send him a screen recording of the site, and a little bit of the video. I felt uncomfortable with the request. 

I was a complete pushover, and didn't outright say no. If I did say no, he disregarded it and continued asking. I eventually caved and sent a clip. I felt weird. 

It might be worth mentioning that he did bring up at one point when we were talking that he did manage to access the site on his own, and commented that it was disgusting. Which raised a red flag for me, if he thought the content was disgusting, why ask for so much sexual content from me? 

There was an incident in which we were 'arguing' about whether or not eating carrots or a certain type of vegetable could change the pigment of your skin. I thought it was impossible, and he asked me how much would I bet on it. I jokingly said 'anything' because I thought I would be right.  He ended up being right.

In my eyes (and expirence) anyone in that situation would take the anything card as bragging rights. 

Nope. He said that he now had a card in which I would have to do one thing he said. Okay, I thought it wouldn't be bad. 

Nope, again, to my dismay. After a few days, he decided to cash it in. He wanted a video of me in a sexual manner, touching myself and moaning. Needless to say, I felt extremely uncomfortable at the request and tried to deny it. He kept enforcing that I *had* to do it as I lost the bet. 

I caved and said I would do it if I had the time. He would ask when I was going to send the videos daily. Pressuring me to send them. Disregarding my excuses to why I didn't take them yet. 

I eventually caved and recorded the video one day when I was home alone after getting home from class. I felt weird, but he complimented them so much.

He would compliment me so often, and was kind to me when I had never expirenced that amount of affection from anyone at that point of my life. 

He was so kind to me, and as I felt I did not deserve the affection, I would try to reciprocate. I was loving to him aswell, but I also started not to protest the sending of lewd images and videos when he requested them. 

He did send some lewd imagery in return, but not nearly as much as he asked of me. He said he was worried his parents would access the lewd images of him, but apparently it was completely safe for me to continue sending sexual content to him.

It was a red flag, looking back on it, but I accepted it at face value at the time as I trusted him greatly. 

He happened to express a great interest in video calling while we both showered. We would shower as normally, then he wanted for us to mutually masturbate. At this point I was not physically developed enough to recieve pleasure in a way that made me want to touch myself. I couldn't make myself orgasm. 

He knew this, but still encouraged the masturbation sessions. It got to such a point that he was asking if I could orgasm I would fake them when I was done to placate him. 

When I expressed disinterest in participating in a masturbation session, he took it as a jab to his ego and would ask me what he was doing wrong, what I wanted him to do to arouse me, etc. 

It led me to feeling bad whenever I didn't want to participate that I stopped saying no. I didn't want him to feel bad, as he was so nice to me and wanted me to feel good. 

The fact that he had pressured me into participating in those activities when I was not physically or mentally mature enough to has fucked up my perception.

It had made me more comfortable with advances from male friends in a sexual manner when I shouldn't have been, and had trouble with dividing sex as something that is a given if someone is kind and they ask for it/they deserve it because I think highly of them, instead of something between two consenting partners. 

Was it sexual abuse?

In my mind I was a consenting indivual during the process, but the lack of pictures from his part and the fact I felt so dirty and violated afterwards has made me start to really think that maybe I was pressured into doing those actions. Even if I was pressured, was it even abuse as he was a minor aswell?

*Sidenote:*

*This incident isn't based of sexual content, but is something I remember very clearly that harmed me aswell. It happened towards the ending of the relationship. 

We were talking about interests. I was, and still am very quite when it comes to talking about myself. I trusted him and valued his opinion very greatly, so I thought it was safe to nerd out a little on a topic I was very interested in. He said it was stupid, why would I be interested in studying such a thing as it was just common sense to know. He did apologize afterwards when he noticed I became quite after the encounter, but it still hurt nonetheless. 

I could mention a few more incidents when he was rude to me in what seemed to be an unfair situation, and also I could critique a few red flags about him I wished I paid attention too, but this post is to clarify whether I was sexually abused or not.*

**TL:DR: When I was 13(F), my first boyfriend showed me his genitals, pressured me to show mine, pressured me to send videos of me in a sexual manner, and pressured me to partake in sexual actions. He was nice to me so I sent sexual content when he asked (he asked often), as I felt I had to be nice to him in return.**

**Was it sexual abuse?**

**In my mind I was a consenting indivual during the process, but the lack of pictures from his part and the fact I felt so dirty and violated afterwards has made me start to really think that maybe I was pressured into doing those actions.

Important Sidenote: 

None of this occurred physically. Everything was either spoken, in picture or video form, or over a video call.

g7r3f9,I don't know what to do,"This began when I was a little child. My dad would touch me very inappropriately while my mom was at work and I wouldn't know how to get away from him.
He did a lot of disgusting and traumatizing things and I still have nightmares to this day.
Did he ever stop? No. I'm currently 20 yo and I'm just trying to finish my studies. He is on and off about it. Like... He'd be normal for a few days/weeks, then he starts his shit again. I'm so sick and tired of him putting his hands where they don't belong and I've told him about it a million times by now. It's like talking to a wall or worse. He gets angry about it and is all like ""the little princess has rights""/""why don't you pack your bags and get tf out?""/""go get some fuckboy to screw you and gtfo"" and many more.
I told my mom about it for the first time a few years ago, that didn't end well. They had an argument and she's trying her hardest to keep him away, but he's a miserable human at times. He's been telling me ever since that I'm only doing this to be an asshole(telling my mom about it) and that I'm ruining this family.
My mom is the one providing for our family and she's away a lot. Now, with the virus, she's at home more, but my dad is not working at all. He does absolutely nothing all day so, every single time he gets bored, he comes to my room and ""hugs me"" while making sure he touches other parts too. When I shove him away and tell him to stop he gets all aggressive about it and says: ""What? I don't have the right to touch you?! I made you so you're mine.""
When I tell him it's not normal for him to behave like this he just says:""If you don't like it, get your (private parts names) out of here"" as in pack your bags and leave.
While he's at home, he's been drinking a lot more often. He's not getting hammered, but one beer is enough for him to become unbearable. He's miserable towards my mom and he literally blackmails her saying he'll just sell everything we have(recently moved into a new house) and we can go to hell. This house is mostly my mom's money, but it's not legally on her name. She never thought he'd be that big of an idiot and the ugly truth is that she would never leave him because they've been married for almost 25 years. He also gets extremely angry if my mom asks him to prepare something for lunch since he's staying home(and had been for a few months) and he's all like:""why do I have a daughter if she doesn't cook?"" knowing damn well I have online classes and exams are coming up. Every single time I get to relax a bit, he has to ruin it. I'm just sick of it.

g7u7yg,Is this abuse?,"I am an adult now, but had a very tumultuous relationship with my mom as a teen. 

From the time I was 1-12 years old,things were great. My mom was my best friend. We went shopping every Sunday together and would go out to eat if we could afford it. We would come home and watch tv, drink diet coke and eat lime tortilla chips (I have fond memories of this time). 

She and my dad divorced when I was 12. She immediately began dating another man, and the month after her divorce with my dad was final, she married this other guy. He is a narcissistic abuser. I know that, 100%. Behind closed doors, he constantly belittled my mom, tore down her self esteem, and tried to close her off from everyone (including her own children). 

Obviously that changed her. But she changed before she married him. While she and my dad were separated, she would be out all night and not answer the phone (and I would be up late, worried sick). 

Once we moved in with her abusive new husband, we no longer went shopping on Sundays (they did it and I wasn't allowed to come even if I asked), I can count on one hand how many times I've went out to eat with her since then (10 years later), and we stopped hanging out together. They went shopping. They did activities together. She never did anything with me, it's like she didn't value any time with me. I would cry and tell her I felt like she didn't want to be around me, and she would scream and say she will not be forced to choose between me and her husband. I just wanted to spend time with her. 

As time went on, things got worse. She and I were constantly emotionally abused by her husband. He would scream at me for 45 min - 1 hour straight (repeating the same thing, not letting me speak) and she would just stand there and watch. 

One time, we were all watching a movie that I mentioned I had seen before. I guess something that bothered her husband was when people spoiled endings? I wasn't going to spoil the ending. But I said, ""you're really going to enjoy the twist"" or something along those lines. My mom began screaming at me not to ""fuck up their night"", not to spoil it and to just shut the fuck up. I was maybe 14 or 15 and was tired of being spoken to that way. I told her ""I'm not spoiling the ending. I'm not saying anything else."" And she told me to get the hell out of the room. I left, and she followed me into the bathroom. She grabbed me by the neck and shoved me against the wall, saying to never spoil the ends of movies and talk during them again. 

I never reported anything. We ended up leaving when I was 17 and they divorced. We lived in an apartment alone for a summer before she moved in with another guy. The summer was okay, but she still didn't spend a lot of time with me. 

At this point, facebook was popular. She did (and still does) post things all over facebook about how ""you are not your child's friend. They will listen to you and that's that"". She sends me memes about children being annoying and wanting to disown them. I don't think it's very funny. I don't even live at home, I barely speak to her. How can I be so annoying? I don't respond most of the time. 

Is this abuse? Is she an abuser? I don't live at home now, and I don't go home very often.

g7yyuv,I was sexually abused by my father,"Hi everyone! I really don't know where to start tbh and I really hope this never comes across someone I know because for some reason I feel embarrassed ( IDK if that's the correct emotion) for everything that went down in my life. I have never been the type to blame myself for what happened, but I do get angry when I think about how my life would have turned out differently if my biological father would have never sexually abused me as a child...

I am 21 years old now and believe it or not I have never had what you can call it a ""stable"" relationship. I was always needy and always  ""trying to make it work"" when the relationship was clearly over. I have now a better understanding of what it takes to be in a relationship but here comes the catch..

I met a nice guy about 4 months ago on a dating app and we immediately kicked it off. He's a gentleman and always puts me first. He sends me flowers ( although I never expected him to) and he is a great listener and conversationalist. However, this guy has the same built like my father. He is quite tall and buff like him... and deep down I feel disgusted... Of course, I do not think of this when I am having sex with the guy I'm dating, but the fact they do resemble one another is bothering me... 

We haven't been hanging out at all because of COVID  and I feel like the spark isn't there anymore, and I think it has to do with him resembling the person I hate the most in this word. I want to end things but Idk how to without exposing my business... Someone, please help me

ALSO I want to add that yes I noticed his height and built when we first went out on a date and it never really bothered me as much until he started to make comments like "" wow, your dad is around my height"". Keep in mind that the guy I'm dating is 6'8",xxoceaneyesxx,2020-04-25 11:50:15,3,358,15.44,27.88,96.43,11.35,19.89,11.73,95.25,63.69,22.63,15.64,11.45,0.84,0.56,2.51,0.28,6.98,5.59,12.85,10.06,7.54,9.5,3.91,18.72,3.07,2.51,2.79,1.96,1.68,4.75,1.68,2.79,0.28,1.96,0,13.13,1.12,1.4,0,5.03,17.6,3.35,1.96,2.23,2.79,4.19,5.03,1.12,0,0.28,0.84,1.68,0,0.56,0.84,0,7.26,3.63,1.4,1.4,1.4,0,4.19,15.08,0.56,16.76,2.23,5.87,8.66,1.12,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,1.4,0,1.12,0.28,0,0.56,14.53,7.26,1.96,0,0,0,0.28,0,1.68,2.23,1.12,0

g83cmj,“You don’t know what abuse is”,"I posted this in r/iamapeiceofshit before I discovered this subreddit so I’m reposting it here. 

The end paragraph is the really important one about why I'm posting this story. If anyone knows of any other subreddits or websites or anywhere else I could post this please let me know cause I need to spread this as far as I can.

I don’t even really know where to start. I'm gonna try to keep this as short as possible, if I went into every little detail I could write a novel. I had met this guy, Noah, and we really hit it off. We had a lot in common but mainly BDSM and Starwars. In the beginning we were genuinely friends. I went to him with my problems and he came to me with his. I can clearly remember one day when I was in class and he texted me cause he was having trouble with a friend of his. And then normally at night we would sext each other.To put it bluntly we were friend with benefits.

Well one night we were doing our usual and he asked to take it one step farther with something I wasn't comfortable with. Im not going to go into detail for privacy reasons but I should mention I was in an abusive relationship with a pedophile who manipulated me into doing it a lot. So I told him that I wasn't comfortable with it and why (I had become a lot more comfortable with talking about it as the years went on). I told Noah everything, how this guy abused me and what he did and the tactics he used, literally everything. So Noah says he understands and he was very sympathetic, again like a friend would be. 

I honestly think that was my biggest mistake in all of this. Not to long after he began to use these tactics on me. I can't remember what it was about anymore but at one point we got in an argument and he blocked me on everything but snapchat, this is also something my previous abuser did as a way of making me feel like everything was my fault and I was in the wrong. They've both messed me up so much that when people unfriend me or block me or basically anything thats cutting ties with me, I go insane. It causes a huge amount of anxiety and depression. And unfortunately he kept doing this, any time I tried to stand up for myself he would pull this and I would run back to him apologizing and begging for him to forgive me.

Then all of a sudden anything I liked was stupid. And if I liked something he also liked I was stupid and had bad opinions on it. Now obviously he didn't phrase it that bluntly but when I mentioned that I like the Beatles and the Foo Fighters I was given a lecture on why both of those bands suck and why the people who listen to them suck (This resulted in another fight cause my dads the one who got me hooked on the Beatles and I think my dads an amazing guy. He once again blocked me everywhere but snapchat so he could watch me panic and beg for him to come back)

These were the little things that went on for a while until one day I made one of the biggest and most regrettable mistakes of my life. I worked for a doggy daycare place and on Sundays I worked the morning shift (5-11). This morning I had gotten off work early and I texted him asking if he wanted to meet up. He worked in downtown Denver as a security guard and he had said yes. This next part is NSFW so just be warned. So I drove down to Denver and he guided me (and I think this was illegal cause he was a security guard for private property and indecent exposure but I'm not sure if I'm right about this, if anyone can confirm I would appreciate it). But he had talked me into sucking his dick in an abandoned building. Originally he wanted to cuff me to a support beam but, seeing as this was our first time meeting in real life, I was uncomfortable with that. I don't know what happened but (thankfully) we never ended up having sex and neither of us reached climax and after that we walked around for a bit then I headed home. 

The next day he had blocked me on everything. And I panicked because everything was more then just fine, it was perfect yesterday so this made no sense.  Im gonna say this now I take full responsibility for freaking out and getting a bit obsessive and physco, however I ask whoever is reading this to please keep in mind that I had been so conditioned to apologize and beg for forgiveness that not being able to do that tore me up, I did everything I could to contact him but nothing worked.

A few months later, after I had finally moved on and calmed down, he messages me again. Noah said he was ""checking in and making sure I was ok"" ya know something like a friend would do, and I fell for it. After that everything got worse. He waited till I was convinced we were friends again and he really started to pressure me. If he was horny I was ""beautiful and sexy and so wonderful"". If I was horny I was ""overweight and annoying and ugly"". Side note, yes I do weigh more then him but thats because I'm at least a foot, if not 2 taller, then him. He pressured me to do things that made me incredibly uncomfortable and I went along with it cause I wanted to make him happy. I feel like I should mention that when we weren't sexting I heard all about how ""lonely and miserable"" he was, even though now its clear to me that was a lie. One night he pressured me to go really far because, and I cannot make this up, he ""had a date with a girl the next day so this might be the last chance we had to do anything"". He would constantly try to get me to break the law like how he always asked me to meet him in the children's park near both of us to suck his dick or something like that.

The big incident came on New Years eve 2019. I had plans to go to a party after work and stay the night (party was hosted by a friend of mine). I had mentioned it to him and he had offered to drive me (and consistently tried to convince me I should give him road head the whole time). After I told him I planned to stay the night so I was gonna drive myself up there, he became a bit iffy with the whole idea of us meeting. I told him I had no plans the next day and I knew his parents weren't home, cause he had mentioned it earlier in the week and invited me over. Well he had suddenly gone from wanting to fuck me to totally disinterested. I want to emphasize I never have or will imply someone HAS to have sex with me just cause they say they want to, I get it people change there minds and thats 100% ok. But I was so confused by the sudden 180 so I asked what happened and if something was wrong.

His response was ""Oh I was just making sure you were listening""

I don't know what else I can really say to that but that was honestly the most emotionally manipulative thing I had ever seen.

Later that night I had gotten tipsy and finally had the courage to go off on him. I told him in great detail everything he had done to me. I didn't check my phone till the next morning cause I wanted to party and forget about him and everything he had done. I woke up to the screenshot I posted before this where he said ""You don't know what its like to be abused at all"".

I have tried to give him the benefit of the doubt because If someone told me I was abusive I don't think I would have reacted fantastically in the moment but the fact he messaged me a few months later and never even apologized says a lot.

This is the important paragraph. Im writing and posting this story now because Noah is trying to become a cop, or something in law enforcement I can't remember the exact title he told me. I am writing this because the idea of that scares me. Ive heard the horror stories of women and men who try to get restraining orders and the cop they talk to won't listen. I have heard the horrors of cops who are brutal and uncaring. I know not everyone will agree with me but I think an important part of being a cop is compassion, understanding, and actually listening, 3 things Noah Mauro does not posses. The idea of him being given a gun and power scares me to death, and not just for me but for the other woman he abused, Kaylyin (I'm using a fake name to respect her privacy). I am also posting this because a friend of mine, who's family has a very close relationship with the local police force, has told me I can go to the cops with the screen shots I have and if nothing else I can get a restraining order and have him put on a watch list. I haven't yet because I know, for the career he's aiming for he has to have a perfectly clean record and I know if I go to the police it will ruin any chance he has of achieving his dreams. The other reason I'm posting this is because he knows where I live and we live in the same city, only about 6 miles apart. I don't know if I'm being paranoid but I want there to be proof of my story if something does happen to me. Think what you want of me,  think what you want of him but I have been silent for way to long about what happened to me.",TheScarletJones,2020-04-25 16:07:07,7,1758,20.29,39.67,63.66,19.8,23.44,13.14,94.2,63.14,23.72,16.38,10.24,1.02,0.34,4.49,0.28,7.34,5.29,12.34,10.18,5.18,9.22,1.93,20.36,4.27,2.28,1.76,1.08,1.93,5.75,2.67,3.07,0.97,1.08,0.34,12.97,0.23,0.8,0.23,4.78,15.24,2.5,2.62,2.62,3.3,2.05,4.38,1.54,0.4,0.97,0.11,1.08,0.34,0.28,0.63,0.11,7.74,2.62,1.14,2.33,1.02,0.74,8.76,9.5,0.97,13.08,1.99,5.52,5.57,1.25,0.51,0.17,0.06,0,0.06,1.37,0.4,0.51,0.28,0.17,0,10.13,4.27,2.16,0,0,0,0,0.06,0.91,1.71,0.91,0.11

g83p12,Was I actually sexually abused or did I bring it upon myself?,"I'm female, for reference.

When I was about 7 years old, my mum and a couple of other family members went on holiday to Africa. There, my mum met a man, fell in love, and years later after loads of visa drama and extortionate amounts of money being spent on him, he finally moved country to live with us. Things were great at first. I looked up to him as the dad I never had.

 Add a few more years, and I'm about 11 or 12. My mum had left the room for a while, and I was lying on his chest with a blanket draped over us. He, very gradually, pushed my body down towards his crotch. My hand was pressed against his genitals. I was tired and pretty careless about what was going on, so I didn't do anything. My mum entered the room again and he lifted me back up, pretending like nothing had happened. I think this might have been the first time he started doing this.

Another time, we had finished watching a movie at home and I was leaning against him (this was a frequent thing that you will see reoccur in this post - we were super close and I essentially thought of him as a human teddy bear). He pulled me up so I was lying across his body, chest to chest (similar to the previous example). He held an arm over my back and used it to manoeuvre me up and down, essentially dragging me slightly lengthwise over his body. He would also stick his thumb in my mouth while doing this. I remember I could feel his erection, but I barely even knew what an erection was when I was 11. I honestly didn't think much of it at the time, however, looking back I realise that he was using me to pleasure himself. He would run his hands up my sides and touch the sides of my chest. One time he went as far as to graze the side of my nipple, but no further. 

We were lying in bed together at one point, and he was doing a similar thing except we were lying on our sides. I just wanted to hug him, but was fine with whatever he wanted to do. Didn't see the harm in it and whatever. He kissed my lips and sucked on the top one. He pulled back, asked ""you like that?"", and continued. Suddenly, he pushed me away. Told me, ""leave, quick, before your mum comes back"". It was then that I was confused and started to realise the severity of it. 

Incidents like these happened frequently for a long time. These are just some of the memorable ones. 

I know that this was sexual in nature. I know children can't consent. However, I don't know what to call it. Was it sexual abuse? I feel like I'm being over dramatic by calling it that because I went along with it despite knowing that it was wrong (although I didn't know HOW wrong it was, I just thought it was something my mum would give me into trouble for or something). What's more is that I kept going back to him, even if I thought it was going to happen again. I just liked being held and being given affection, which is what I thought it mainly was. 

My mum and him split 4 years ago. He hates my guts and I hate his. However, due to my half brother, my mum has to remain in contact with him. She often talks to me about him and it has slowly worn down my mental health.

g83v0o,Im reporting my ex step dad. I need help on what to do.,"He and my mom finally separated so I told her he molested me from I guess 9-14? I'm not sure yet, I have to write a lot of stuff down and ask others to help me remember some stuff. But once I told her we found out A LOT of stuff. Like that a lot of people in our ""family church"" knew about multiple other girls before he even moved in with my mom. 
I'm 28 now I think the rape happened around 12/13 but again, I have to write down my life. But I know the house it happened in. I drive by it nearly daily. 

He's also probably/possibly schizophrenic. Do I just go to the regular cops or do I need to go to some special place? I live in Arkansas, so I know people may not know. 

Where do I start? I know the girls he touched before me. They probably can't do much since it was about 20+ years ago for them. But where the man is living they allow him around other people's kids, because his dad is the pastor of the church. 

They are subjecting other people's kids to him Knowing What he did and has done. Please, someone tell me where to start?

g87xpz,"Me and my mom had a short and brief discussion about people not wanting to be home during quarantine, and the conversation was short for a reason","First off me, my mom, my titi and cousin all had to run errands today, and so we did but as we pulled up too Walmart it was packed. My mom was freaking out because she never liked crowded places but now with the Coronavirus she is extra paranoid. After we are done with the errands me and my mom are riding back home and 

##she’s like: “ i don’t understand how people could not want to be home with their kids or take this time TO be more involved with their kids/ spouses. The kids aren’t in school anymore so that should make them want to spend more time with them you know?”

#i said: yeah

Than her focus went onto something else which i was thankful for because it took me everything not too break down and start crying. She’s only saying that because there was MAAAD people outside like everyones not supposed to be home. 

1. First off my problem with her statement was she thinks everyones out and about shopping and getting away from their family life when, yes that is the case BUT there are ALSO others who are PURPOSELY staying home to do no good. 

2. She’s forgetting there are kids and adults who are now forced to stay home with the people who they were in the FIRST place trying to get away from as MUCH as they can. If its a kid than school was there quiet time away from the abuse, if its an adult their work life was their escape place. Now that this lockdown happened all of that escaping has been on hold and it breaks my heart.

3. So yeah some might take this lockdown to actually pay attention to whomever they are around, but there are fucks out there who like that there is a lockdown just so they can abuse their targets even more now.


##During this lockdown I’ve been in the house with 3 raging bitches of girls who are my sisters and mom and the abuse for me has yet to die down. We have our good moments but right after that its back to the bullshit. I don’t have anyone else sexually abusing me anymore since my mom moved in by herself with us this time which i am thankful for, but i still get emotionally, mentally, and physically abused from everyone including her. 

Abuse is abuse no matter the aspect and my heart goes out to everyone dealing with this bullshit and the people doing the bullshit. My moms very close minded even though she is a survivor of childhood abuse, i just think the way she was raised and her trauma genuinely has her fucked up and not able to view or see things from a different aspect. But still, she acts like there isn’t uncles, dads, sisters, brothers, friends, step dads, aunts, and moms abusing others during this time and its quite annoying. 

Anyways i just wanted to get this off my chest, everyone is in my prayers and i love you very much.

g886g0,Is it possible to mask an emotion with a different one to make it less painful?,"So first, background. My parents are divorced and remarried. My dad and step mom both have a history of abuse and neglect from parents and relationships and project their feelings onto my siblings and I. Mostly by guilt trips, passive aggressive comments and anything that makes us feel like we are worthless, insignificant and stupid. 

My birthday is in a couple days. My dad texted me something about it and didn’t like my answer. He didn’t really respond and 30 seconds later I got 4 huge messages from my stepmom basically calling me and my mom selfish and saying I don’t care about them or love them (there’s a bit more but personal details you know?). Now understand, this happens fairly often (once or twice a month at least) so I’m quite used to it. I thought it was hilarious how pathetic the whole thing sounded but a certain detail kinda pissed me off. 

I told my mom what my stepmom had said (mom is well aware of how stepmom is) and my mom got worried for me. I didn’t feel afraid or upset at all while texting but when I was telling my mom, my hands started shaking bad and I started picking at the skin around my fingers (a habit I’ve had since I was 7).

g8a8kp,I'm not sure if I was physically abused as a child,I'm pretty sure I was emotionally abused as a child. My mother doesn't understand healthy boundaries and my father was an alcoholic. Shaming was a big part of punishment. I remember I got in trouble for swearing once and my parents would make me feel terrible about it everyday for over a week. And they both would gang up on me at once. They still do this but I can look past it. But memories have been popping up lately and I remember being hit in the head so hard I saw starts multiple times. I remember me doing something before I was hit that I shouldn't have been doing. The time I remember clearly was in my early teens and I screamed and swore at my mom and I had my head punched into the ground several times. I still feel like I'm lying to myself and I wasn't really abused.

g8ap65,Relationship after abuse,"I was abused as a teenager for over a year. I was not able to go forward with a case because there was not enough proof, I've had to let go with getting ""justice"" and find it in my own way, I guess. I am now in college, it has been three years since the last in-person encounter with my abuser. He has tried since then to reach me over social media and seems to keep popping up from time to time (he is blocked on all sites and no longer tries to reach out) I have a therapist and have a fantastic support system, I am looking for people who may understand how I am feeling and have some advice through their own experiences. 

I have been dating someone for a little over a year and a half now. We have spent more time apart than together, we went to highschool together and he is a year older than me. We dated through his first year of college and were about 2 hours apart then. After one year he went into the military and now I am in my first year of college while he's away. He's been in basic since october and the last time I saw him was february. The next time will probably be in december due to covid. When I was still in highschool I appreciated the space since I was a mess, it took me almost a year to tell him what happened and why I am the way I am.  I cry so much, when it's bad I can cry every day up to 4x a day for a month straight. I have non-epileptic seizures which my doctor thinks is related to my PTSD or anxiety. On top of it all, I'm not gonna lie, I get jealous, I jump to conclusions, I am insecure, but I am fully aware that none of that is based in reality.  I usually never talk to him when I think this because I know he is a loyal and loving man. I know, even in the midst of a panic attack, he really loves me. 

People would even comment on how ""healthy"" our relationship was, I was very proud because that's something I have never had. It is my ultimate goal for all my relationships now lol. But here I am, a year and a half later, still insecure that I am not enough for him and he doesn't really want to be with me. I don't think he is doing anything wrong or lost feelings, but my mind just keeps going and I think my PTSD, anxiety, and depression (all clinically diagnosed) is a burden on him. Especially with the pandemic, he is under an insane amount of stress and it is hard to talk to him. He's so exhausted he doesn't have the capacity to really have much on a convo. We also get such a short period of time to talk, usually an hour at the most, I don't want to talk about this with him, I want to tell him about the hikes I'm going on and the cool flowers I see, not the fact that I'm crying every day again and so frustrated why my mind is like this. I've learned how to identify when my mind is spirling, but don't know how to stop myself from still feeling like it's true. 

My therapist told me the hardest relationship is the one after abuse. He has been so kind and patient with me but I don't know how to feel more secure in myself and our relationship. I know if this continues, it will ruin the relationship. It simply cannot continue because I want to be with this person. I love him so much and I don't want to lose him because I have mental issues.",fahtray,2020-04-26 01:11:55,1,650,26.25,28.97,92.98,6.74,21.67,12.15,95.23,63.38,19.23,15.23,10.31,0.92,0,3.85,0.15,4,5.85,14,12.31,7.23,8.31,2.62,20.31,4.31,2.46,2.15,1.23,2.31,6,2.15,3.85,0.92,1.08,1.08,9.69,0,0,0,4,13.85,3.54,2.62,1.08,2.31,1.85,3.23,1.69,0.46,0,1.08,1.38,0,1.08,0,0,7.85,3.08,1.54,2.15,0.77,0.77,3.85,15.69,1.23,17.69,1.54,6.46,10,1.23,0.15,0,0.15,0,0,0.46,0,0.31,0.15,0,0,12.92,4.46,4.15,0,0,0,0,0.31,0.62,2.77,0.62,0

g8bv0z,Running away...,"Hey,

I’m 27 years old, married and I have a 10 month old baby. I live in a middle eastern country, and married a middle eastern man 3 years ago. I am Canadian. 

I have been dealing with his abuse ever since I got pregnant. It was emotional and verbal abuse at first while I was pregnant and then when my daughter turned 3 months old, the physical abuse started. 

I was in love with him, which is why we got married in the first place but even though he says he loves me and my daughter I don’t think he does. Why hurt the ones you love? 

I had enough about a week ago after getting slapped suddenly for no reason and decided to take my daughter and stay somewhere else. Ever since he’s been constantly harassing me on the phone and threatening to divorce me and take my daughter away from me like everyday. I don’t care about him, I actually hate him, but he knows my daughter is my weak point and I would do anything for her so he uses that as a way to control the situation and get back at me. 

Yesterday I had enough and started having suicidal thoughts. But the only thing stopping me from doing anything stupid or crazy is my daughter and what would happen to her...

Anyway after 4 hours of crying on and off, I made up my mind that I’m going to run away, back to Canada. So I decided I would go back to him today, gain his trust back, wait for the borders to open up again, purchase plane tickets without his knowledge and go home.

It’s very risky because even though I’ve traveled before with my daughter and no one asked for his consent, they MIGHT. Especially with my shitty luck, I have a feeling that will be the time that they will. I’m thinking to minimize the risk, to spend a lot of money on a business class ticket because they don’t bother them with any of this stuff.

For any of you thinking “why not just go the legal route and get full custody” or “ask for your rights” or whatever, you don’t know the Middle East...

Has anyone ever done this before? Does anyone have any advice? I don’t have any other options and I’m so scared but I would die for my daughter.",HopelessCanadian00,2020-04-26 03:04:18,13,405,20.29,43.13,94.53,2.27,18.41,15.06,95.06,62.47,21.23,16.3,10.12,0.25,0.99,3.95,0.99,4.69,4.69,13.09,10.62,7.41,8.89,2.22,20.74,3.7,2.22,1.73,1.98,1.23,5.68,1.48,4.2,0.99,2.22,0.49,13.09,3.7,0,2.47,3.7,14.32,2.72,2.72,0.99,4.2,1.23,3.46,0.99,0,0.49,0.49,2.22,0.25,1.23,0.49,0,6.67,1.73,0.74,1.23,2.22,1.23,5.19,12.84,1.23,19.26,2.22,8.4,9.88,0.74,0.99,0.25,0.99,0,0.49,0.74,0.25,0,0,0,0.25,14.81,6.17,3.95,0,0,0.74,0,0,0.99,2.96,0,0

g8dvgz,I've realised that my dad is abusive...,"Okay, so recently I was talking with my friend about some stuff, and the topic of my dad came up. I mentioned some things that have always felt very normal to me, and my friend was horrified. Apparently most people aren't afraid of their dad's, and some of the things that my dad does fall under the category of child abuse. When I was a kid I didn't really see my dad that often, and it was because him and my mom had very different ideas on how to ""discipline"" kids. My dad thought that my mom was too soft on me, and he prefers the more... Old fashioned path to take.

He has anger issues, and sometimes it feels like I haven't actually done anything wrong, and he's just using me as an outlet for his anger. One time I forgot to put away the salt and pepper, so he yelled at me, and threw away the meal. He made me look up if it's legal to spank your kids, and when he saw that it is he spanked me just to show that he could. 

Here is the problem, even though I've realised this, and I know logically that it's awful, it's not sinking in emotionally. I just feel numb thinking about it, and I don't really resent my dad for it at all. 

When I think of this stuff happening to other people, it seems really awful, and I feel really bad for them. I can't imagine ever hitting my kids, the thought of it makes me feel sick, and I wouldn't want my kids to be afraid of me either. But when I apply this logic to myself, it doesn't seem to stick. 

I know this sounds awful... But I don't really care that he's abusive. I think it's probably because of how I've been raised. I've always tried my best to please my dad, and make him happy. He has depression, and my family has always talked about how seeing me makes it so much better, and my grandma even told me that he said I'm the only thing keeping him from... Well you know. 

I love my dad, and some twisted part of my brain keeps telling me that if letting his anger out on me makes him happy, I should just let him and that it's probably my fault anyway. I don't want to upset him, or anything like that, and it's not like he's always this scary person. 90% of the time he's really sweet and funny. Does it really matter that 10% of the time he's terrifying?

He had an awful childhood, and while I know that it's no excuse, he never really had an example for how to be a good parent. 

I know that it's not normal to be cautious what you say, for fear of your parent screaming at you, but it's my normal. I don't even see my dad that often, only in the holidays, and when I do I'm not alone with him for the majority of that time. The only time I've actually been frightened for my safety, has been when we're alone together.

It could be so much worse, and I know that for some of my friends it most definitely is. Hell, some of my friends don't even have dad's, so I should probably be grateful. 

I don't know, I've literally just realised that this stuff isn't normal, and maybe it's taking a while to sink in.. But I feel like I should be more upset. Is there something wrong with me that I'm just kinda numb to it? 

Tldr; I've realised that my dad is abusive, but I'm not as upset about it as I should be.",LastKnightofNi,2020-04-26 05:55:31,2,632,2.73,20.09,65.66,1.64,18.06,9.49,95.41,66.3,27.85,17.88,12.66,0.16,0.79,3.96,0.32,9.97,3.16,10.92,12.5,9.49,9.02,3.16,20.89,6.01,2.69,1.74,0.47,2.53,7.75,2.37,5.38,1.42,1.58,0.47,11.71,2.85,0.63,0.47,5.85,17.09,4.11,1.9,2.06,3.96,1.27,5.06,3.16,0.95,0.79,1.11,0.95,0.16,0.16,0,0.47,4.59,1.58,0.47,0.95,0.79,1.27,3.8,14.24,0,7.59,0.95,2.53,4.11,0.16,0.32,0.16,0,0.16,0,0.95,0.16,0.32,0.16,0.16,0.16,20.73,6.65,6.33,0,0.16,0.32,0,0,0.32,6.65,0,0.32

g8h70z,Am I abusive?,"I’m 8 months pregnant, and my husband has been claiming now for about a month that I am abusive. I’ve been abused in prior relationships, but the abuse was really clear before, and I don’t know if I’m inflicting pain on my partner and if this is on my shoulders to fix. I’ll start by saying, I don’t feel abusive. I actually really want wonderful things for my husband, and he has suffered from a lot of childhood abuse and trauma that left him without a ton of career options. Money has been a consistent struggle for us, and it typically falls on my shoulders to make sure we have enough. I know he feels less than because of this, and suffers from very low self esteem and confidence, which he is now saying is worse than I was prior to meeting me, and the way he feels now is largely in part due to how I have treated him in our relationship. He says that everything is at my pace and I’ve been rushing him through the relationship. He even tells me now he tried to tell me he wasn’t ready to get married- I remember having this conversation a few times after he asked me to marry him (we both decided mutually on a vacation we wanted to get married, and he proceeded to fix up an heirloom ring from my family to propose formally). Once we started making plans, it was very stressful mostly because of my mother and I will admit I had a hard time standing up for what we really wanted. My mother is pretty emotionally immature and I didn’t have the tools to deal with it and shield him from it. My parents have also been a bit condescending about his financial status, as I grew up being told the man is supposed to be the bread winner and they have a hard time with switched gender roles. For the most part I tell them to fuck off if they bring it up, but I know my husband feels the micro-aggressions when we visit- I moved to his state after dating long distance about a year.

Now we weren’t planning on getting pregnant so soon after getting married. He and I had talked about kids, but I knew he had a lot he wanted to accomplish before that happened. Now this is where it starts to get sticky.... I haven’t been on birth control for years. I have never had a scare with previous partners and have used condoms except for when I know it’s safe- that I’ve definitely already ovulated and the ovum is past the point of being able to become fertilized. Feel as you wish about natural family planning but I don’t do well on birth control. My husband has some damage to his penis from circumcision that makes him very sensitive. He had expressed that sometimes unprotected sex wasn’t very comfortable. I like the way unprotected sex feels, but I would never want to make him do something that doesn’t feel right. But like I mentioned, I have been in pretty horribly abusive relationships before that make sex in general feel very disconnected. Prior to this relationship, I hadn’t had a spiritual connection during sex. I will say I felt this connection with him a few times and it was new to me, but the instances where I felt totally connected and completely in the moment were very rare- sex was mostly physical because that’s what I knew, and even felt safer with considering my history. No, I don’t think this is healthy and I am in therapy. All of this is contextually important. There were moments where we would be getting ready to have sex, and I would tell him we were safe- and I never asserted this if I didn’t fully believe it. I also did not feel ready for a kid even though I’m 30- I just started a business this year and we had a lot of goals we were working toward. Well. We had unprotected sex a handful of times, and I got pregnant. I had never even come close to a scare so as soon as I had spotting instead of bleeding 4 days before I was due to start my cycle I knew and took a test. Literally had never even had to take a pregnancy test before this. Immediately positive, I freaked out knowing what his reaction would be. I started weighing my options and I discussed it with him. I didn’t break the news gracefully- I was being quiet and withdrawn when he got home from work... trying to find the courage to tell him, fearing he would be angry, as I was the one who told him it was safe. I broke down sobbing and told him I was pregnant. Initially he was very supportive, and I think he assumed I would get an abortion. I felt bad I had assumed he would react differently. We had talked about what we would do if it happened before we were married and that’s what I thought I would do. But once I was pregnant, the choice wasn’t as black and white for me. I was overcome with guilt and fear and this weird love for this clump of cells in me. With everything in mind, I decided I couldn’t emotionally handle an abortion. He felt lied to and like I did it on purpose to baby trap him... (we were already married about 5 months at this point)

Anyway, moving forward he got every emotional when bringing up the baby and angry about it. He still feels like his life is over, and has told me over and over he doesn’t want to be a dad and isn’t ready. I accept the consequences of my decision to keep the baby and to me it felt like every option sucked. I told him that if he didn’t want to be a dad, that I would move back home to my family (I don’t have anyone to help me here, other than his family and I think that would just sting too much) and raise him. That I didn’t want him to be stuck and miserable and resent this child. But he claims that’s also not an option and he doesn’t want to be the dead beat dad. I know in my heart that if he is going to resent the baby, that I need to remove us from the situation because I don’t want our son to be subjected to those feelings. That’s not fair to him, and he is the innocent one in this situation. My husband feels I unilaterally made a decision that altered the course of his life and that he didn’t even like unprotected sex and he feels that I coerced him into it. That I should have felt that he was disconnected and uncomfortable when having sex without a condom. He had told me that it was sensitive and hurt, but I can’t ever imagine a scenario where if he told me he wanted to wear a condom that I would be mad or make him feel shame about it. He just never told me and I felt horribly sick that I hadn’t shielded him and made him feel so vulnerable and unsafe. (He has also suffered sexual trauma)

Ok this is getting long, and I know I’m painting myself in a light that doesn’t seem abusive... I personally don’t see it but lately he asserts that the way I have treated him over the past three years has ruined his self esteem and his gusto for life. He is horribly depressed and suicidal and doesn’t feel like he can do any of the things he has wanted for himself- mainly music- because I have been living life at my pace and he feels drug along for the ride. To be fair, this is pretty true. When I moved to be with him, I had just finished grad school, and I had some major goals for business in general. There was a while where I worked three jobs to pay the bills (for a space he claims was far more expensive than he wanted to move to- about $1100/mo for a two bedroom in a lower cost city) and he took time to focus on his music. Except he didn’t focus on his music and I got worn down and frustrated as he struggled to help with making food and doing basic chores around the house. He says that I pushed him to move too fast and he wasn’t ready for that responsibility, and he was just learning how to take care of himself. At the time I was trying to lose weight and had requested that we avoid heavy carbs but he didn’t feel comfortable making the meal plan because he didn’t understand what I needed and wanted. He had just started learning basic recipes and all of the sudden I needed special foods. I was sometimes working 12-16 hours in a day and had very little energy to come home and make food after. I would be hungry and grumpy and frustrated that I wasn’t seeing him help me out or take the load off. I was also wedding planning at this time as well, which I included him in- or I felt like I did- but my mom really took the reigns and made decisions without us. I’ll admit I should have spoken up more and our wedding, while beautiful, was far more lavish than we would have done if we had been left the decision making entirely. Again he felt pushed and along for the ride.

Well, I don’t know if I’ve blocked this out but he claims I told him he was a lazy piece of shit multiple times through this process. I don’t remember saying this and it doesn’t feel like something I would say, but I’ll admit I was resentful, stressed, and feeing like my needs weren’t being met. 

Our latest fight he told me I’m the reason he feels worthless, and it’s because I’ve been very abusive. He feels more hurt by me than the girl who sexually assaulted him after he said no. He feels like my career and preferences have always come first. When he brings up an issue, my initial response is to become defensive- this is DEFINITELY true. I don’t handle criticism well, and this is largely due to the way my parents raised me and I’ve been making great efforts over the past two months to fix this. I’m not happy with how I act all the time, and I don’t want to let my past abuse rule me. I just can’t tell if I’m actually abusive or not. I don’t ask him to do things around the house anymore because I don’t see the point. It won’t get done if I don’t do it. And maybe I just do have higher standards... but I like to clean the kitchen counter daily, and I sweep probably 3 times a week, and I like to eat at home but don’t always have the energy to take care of all of it, and then I get frustrated because he’s not helping... but if it’s not important to him maybe I am just pushing my needs on him. 

He’s not a bad spouse. At all. I don’t feel like he is controlling or jealous- we’ve only had a handful of jealousy issues on both of our parts. I did have to let a male friend of mine go because he didn’t like that we were spending time alone together (this only happened maybe three times and I just don’t have a lot of friends here so I didn’t have a third to invite as my husband was usually working when he was free to do something) and I understood why he felt uncomfortable, even though I’m pretty positive neither one of us ever flirted or wanted to flirt with the other...

Anyway this has turned into a rambling mess. Am I controlling? Have I drug him along for the ride? He doesn’t even text people back or look at his phone or answer calls anymore and he claims his apathy is because I’ve stolen his joy and freedom. I’m really sad and he told me he thinks we should divorce last night. I don’t want him to be miserable but he says I’ve made that choice for him already when I decided to keep the baby. And that I lied to him about who I am.

Thanks for bearing with me. I don’t want to hurt him, and I want my marriage to survive.",hellopalindrome,2020-04-26 09:22:09,2,2134,14.06,38.92,47.14,10.41,21.56,13.59,95.41,62.84,22.21,16.92,9.42,1.45,0.05,5.86,0.14,5.3,4.5,12.04,12.46,6.09,8.43,3.37,23.29,4.31,2.34,1.36,0.94,1.55,6.84,2.81,4.03,0.89,1.45,0.84,13.12,1.92,0.19,0.19,6.42,15.23,3.8,1.92,2.72,2.72,1.45,4.45,3.23,0.42,0.75,2.06,2.48,0.33,1.08,1.12,0.52,8.06,3.37,1.27,1.92,1.31,0.7,8.9,12.04,0.75,11.48,1.31,4.64,5.72,1.22,0.42,0.66,0.47,0.05,0.09,0.56,0.19,0,0.05,0.23,0.09,13.26,5.2,2.62,0,0,0.14,0,0.75,0,3.89,0.56,0.09
g8ia7j,Confused about “home surgery” on ingrown toenails.,"I had badly infected ingrown toenails until I was 16. Every step hurt and I kind of just got used to it. It discharged a lot. 

When I was at home I tried to keep my feet out of sight because if mother saw, sometimes she would get out her sewing kit. Dad would hold me down while Mom dug around under my toenail with a needle. 

We were poor when I was little, but she saw specialists for her own chronic infection. I’m confused why she didn’t take me to a doctor about this until I was well into my teens. Maybe insurance didn’t cover it. I have no reason to think she was being malicious.

g8lj40,My manipulative mom,"First of all, backstory:
 I am an adopted kid and have been ever since I was 2. My birth mother was a bad mom and never actually did anything to try and be better, or get us (us being me and my bio brother) back. Later, I was touched by my birth brother, so he was kicked out. He went to live with the birth family because my adopted family and I decided not to send him to jail and this was the only option. I visited my birth family occasionally, and my birth mom would lie to me and try to make me feel bad for her. Me being young and stupid, believed some of it and it caused a lot of trouble. 
fast forward a couple years
 I'm 15 and something happens and I'm living with my birth mom for a while I almost died 3 times  because of stupid things, one was from my birth brother whom she talked to after he moved out of her house. She put me in lots of danger, and she tried to tell me my brother wasn't so bad, and that it was my fault. I blamed myself.
After a couple months of living there, my adopted mother took me back (thank god). My birth mother texts my adopted mother and others saying lies about me. I decided to not text her at all.
Fast forward to yesterday
 I texted her and told her I wasn't her kid and I didn't want her in my life. She tried to pin it on me and say I'm sick. I say she was a horrible mother and said that i was never hers and never will be. She says I'm a lie that my adopted mother made. I said I'd rather be a lie than your daughter, and I said stay out of my life you're a horrible mom and all your kids u did take care of turned out to be  messes. Bye. 
I know I could have just never texted her back ,but I felt like I wouldn't have had closure.

g8nw1s,I know this isn’t normal but is it abuse?,"Trigger warning ⚠️ 
Hello, Here’s some background.
My dad retired from the marine core when I was born. My younger years in preschool and kindergarten were joyful (besides his affair w/4 women👀) though until the age of 5 he began to scream and lose control. I’d beg him to stop and my parents would belittle me even more. He would do this often when his affairs weren’t going well and he was stressed. Sometimes I’d run from him and hide in my closet, he’d go in my room and toss my bed (out of anger) and try to push open the closet door I was hiding in. He hasn’t hit me but every time I always think it’s going to happen. He’s grabbed me once, but I was young I’m not sure if I’m making it more than what it was. 
Eventually-
My parents divorced and the yelling stopped for five years. Though one weekend with dad, and he completely loses it over the most minor misunderstanding (because I asked my mom if she was still able to pick me up on the day we all agreed on). He began to call me deceitful, smartass etc. I went to my room and hid in the closet like I used to. I felt like I was having a panic attack and I was terrified. Later I decided I’d walk out the house and call an Uber (40 min drive). 
He saw me try to leave and shut the door in my face and again, began to yell, though this time I recorded everything. You can hear him making fun of me asking my mom for help and sobbing, and he said I “wasn’t going anywhere” so, AGAIN I go to my closet and hide. I thought about calling the police but I didn’t want my dad to lose his job or worse. Though Eventually my friend picks me up and my mom convinced him to let me go. 


My mom never talks to me about these incidents and he always says that I need help and since then I’ve been going to counseling now. I don’t know if I’m in denial or I actually need help. Obviously my story is biased but I’d be willing to send the recording with my voice cut out because I’m ashamed of my sobbing lol. It is triggering and I don’t want anyone to report this.",chriistsu,2020-04-26 15:24:44,3,409,15,19.62,96.67,1.32,17.78,11.25,96.58,58.92,23.23,19.56,14.43,0.24,0.24,4.65,0,3.67,3.18,12.22,9.54,5.62,10.27,2.2,22.98,3.18,2.2,0.73,1.22,1.47,6.36,1.47,4.65,0.98,1.22,1.22,12.96,2.44,0.24,1.47,5.13,15.89,1.96,2.69,2.44,3.18,2.2,5.38,2.44,0.24,1.71,0.49,0.24,0.24,0,0,0,8.07,1.96,1.47,3.18,0.24,2.69,6.11,11.49,1.71,17.36,3.42,5.38,8.56,1.47,0.73,2.44,0,0,0,0.73,0,0.49,0,0.24,0,15.4,5.38,2.2,0,0,0.24,0,0.24,0.49,4.89,1.96,0
g8o2ab,At wit’s end...,"Hi..

I just don’t know what to do anymore and I feel like I can’t talk to anyone other than my therapist about this because no one understands. I apologize if this gets long..

To start, I am a mom to two young children, P is 3 and S is just about 10 months. I (27) left my verbally/mentally abusive husband, D (29) back in early February and moved 4 hours away. My mom, J (47) moved in with me to help out with the kids. I have a long history of various abuse from J growing up. We had a really rough relationship from the time I was about 12 until I was 23. I moved in with my grandparents when I was 15 because of an event with her that caused PTSD. 

Anyways...I started therapy back in February. I have a rough history including an abusive relationship in high school that included so many instances of sexual assault I can’t even give an estimated number of how many times I was forced to do things I didn’t want to do. Not to mention the verbal, mental, and physical abuse I endured during that time. In therapy, my therapist and I are diving into that relationship and all of the PTSD that I suffer from it. Naturally, I’m really struggling with all of it and I get very dissociative after sessions, and my response is to isolate. 

Now the point...every time I go to my room to attend a session (since it’s all virtual at the moment), or if I go to do my schoolwork (I’m a MA student), all I can hear is J losing her shit and freaking out at P. It’s typically the usual toddlerisms that set her off. But I’m finding it extremely triggering as it’s bringing me back to my childhood and causing a flood of bad memories and flashbacks. I don’t know what to do. I desperately need the help...but J has a lot of mental and physical health issues herself, which I understand totally. But I just feel trapped. I escaped an abusive/toxic marriage but now I’m stuck in another cycle and I feel lost. The worst part is, I can’t even fully get away from D because of the kids (and his denial that I want a divorce)...I just want to scream and I feel awful. I feel like a horrible mother. I feel like I can’t handle this..

How do I get through this? Is there truly some sort of “light at the end of the tunnel”? Because it surely doesn’t feel like it 😔",AStoryofTwoSwords,2020-04-26 15:34:27,3,443,48.59,12.48,95.8,1,15.82,16.03,91.65,59.37,19.19,13.09,11.74,0.23,0,1.13,0,6.09,5.87,15.35,7.67,6.32,7.22,2.26,15.35,4.06,2.03,1.35,2.48,2.71,5.19,0.68,4.51,0.68,1.58,0.9,6.55,1.81,0,1.81,0.68,13.54,2.93,2.71,1.35,1.81,2.03,3.84,2.71,0.23,0.45,2.03,2.26,0.23,1.81,0.23,0,5.87,2.03,0.45,2.26,0.9,0.9,3.16,13.77,0,15.35,2.03,6.55,7.45,1.13,0,0.23,0,0.23,0,0.68,0.45,0,0,0,0.23,20.09,9.48,2.93,0,0,0.45,0,0,0.45,3.61,2.71,0.45
g8od2k,"""Whether you feel worthy or unworthy, you are always worthy, but in the latter case, you have unhealed wounds.""","**Explanation**: The mind has the ability to make us believe lies, such as being unworthy. Victims of abuse often experience self-worth issues, and these illusions are so compelling that we think they are real. The truth is, seeing yourself as unworthy is just a defence mechanism, and abusers may need you to doubt or hate yourself so they can feel good about themselves. If you were not enviable to being with, why would they bother hurting you?

g8pxlg,is abusive to strong of a word to describe my mom?,"hello! my name is julie and i’m 14 years old.

i can’t tell if my mom is abusive or just short tempered. i read an article about adults who went through abuse as children but didn’t recognize it was until they were older. one of those adults had a father who was similar to my mother but i don’t know if that means my mom is truly abusive.

i may sound like i’m being a dramatic moody teenager since i am so young. please take time to read the details first.

i already know that my mom is a toxic person. she verbally and physically abuses her boyfriend and is very controlling of his kids. i have seen scratches on my mom’s boyfriend’s arms from her. she has also threatened to call the police on him multiple times and has talked trash about his exes. she accuses him of many things (that i don’t know because they’re probably adult things) and always wonders who he’s texting and emailing. she is also narcissistic and a gas-lighter towards her boyfriend. she can’t handle it when he does something that she doesn’t like. 

my mom is also short tempered. she loses her cool very easily, especially in public. she tends to lash out at me (or anyone around her) whenever something doesn’t go her way or somebody doesn’t do what she wants them to do. 

her short tempered nature also comes with outwardly aggressive and passive aggressive behavior. she is really loud when she yells and sometimes pushes me around or threatens to “abuse me” or hit me. she also tends to grab me by my neck and push me or pin me against a wall. she does all of this to her boyfriend as well. she first showed me her outwardly aggressive anger when i was 8 y/o and she pushed me to the ground. 

now that i’m getting older, she hits and pushes me less. usually when i piss her off she just threatens to take something of mine away (my phone), hit me, or raises her hand to hit me but doesn’t actually do it. the last time she put her hands on me was a year ago when i was 13 and we got into a big argument. i was behind on my chores and she was upset with me. she lost her temper and hit me in the head with her knuckles and sent me to my room. when she calmed down, she came into my room to tell me to do my chores but lost her cool and threatened to hit me again. i told her not hit me anymore and she responded by putting her hand around my neck and called me abusive for “not doing my damn chores”.

i always thought when i was younger, her short temper may be because she also works a busy job as a university professor and is a chair member of a organization. i tried my best to not upset her and did things by myself as a kid. i usually played by myself or went out with my friends. when i got older, i started to hang out by myself and spent a lot of time in my room. 

in the middle of my 6th grade year, i was diagnosed with depression. i spent a lot more time by myself or with close friends. my grades dropped and i took 4-5 hour naps after school everyday. my mom started to notice my routine and my grades and yelled at me. she called me stupid and retarded and told me to “use my damn brain”. obviously, that didn’t help and my grades continued to drop. it was only around the end of year during track season with my friends where i started to feel more confident in myself and picked myself and my grades back up. 

around 7th grade is when i started to develop a temper like my mom. my anger is much less outwardly aggressive and much much more passive. i usually drop comments here and there when i am upset about something and have a very bored face (according to my friends). i tend to suppress my anger a lot which causes me to cry. when i snap, i shout and cry a lot. my passive nature against my mom’s outwardly aggressive nature often go head to head when we argue.

7th grade was not a good year for me or my mother. i started to slip back into my habit of sleeping a lot and letting my grades drop and had a lot of self doubt and questions about myself. my mom was dealing with her slowly deteriorating relationship with her boyfriend. we eventually moved out but my mom and her boyfriend did not split. i think she took out most of her stress about her boyfriend on me by yelling at me about my grades. we got into many heated arguments. i took out my anger towards my mom and stress about myself by crying. i eventually picked up myself and my grades and my mom started to yell at me less. i left a certain group of people that made me feel like shit and had a good state of mind for a while.

now, i’m in 8th grade. i’m doing a lot better in terms of mental health and my grades are doing much much better. my mom yells at me less and hasn’t hit me yet. she has only threatened me and has called me names. i’m trying to keep my grades up so my mom doesn’t yell at me.

there are some days where my mom is pleasant and there’s nothing she’s upset about but there’s also days where she just can’t stop yelling. i am stuck in quarantine with her and i feel very uncomfortable talking or doing anything intimate with her, besides eating dinner.

is my mom abusive? i think abusive is too strong of word but i can’t think of any other word to describe my mom’s behavior. please let me know what you think. 

thank you so much.",loverofuu,2020-04-26 17:22:34,1,1036,20.03,30.79,87.48,1,15.46,12.64,95.27,60.23,23.26,20.17,13.51,0.39,0.19,5.89,0.19,3.09,3.28,13.42,7.72,7.05,9.46,1.93,17.57,4.44,2.51,2.12,0.77,2.7,7.53,1.93,5.6,1.25,3.96,0.68,14,2.03,1.06,7.24,1.35,10.04,1.74,0.87,0.39,4.05,0.97,3.67,2.22,0.19,1.06,0.97,2.03,1.45,0.39,0,0.19,6.56,2.03,1.16,2.41,1.45,0.87,5.69,9.17,0.48,15.25,2.12,6.56,6.85,2.61,0.29,0.58,0.19,0,0,0.87,0.48,0.1,0.19,0.1,0,12.16,6.18,1.16,0,0,0.19,0.1,0.19,0.58,2.9,0.77,0.1
g8q2hc,The Willoughbys: A Wonderful Movie that Represents our Lives.,"I recently watched The Willoughbys on Netflix. It was a cute little children’s movie about four children re-establishing their life and family legacy after “getting rid” of their terrible parents. Trigger warning if you plan to watch: their parents are mentally/emotionally abusive and neglective. It also goes over the faults of child services.

I laughed. I cried. I had panic attacks. Repressed memories resurfaced. But i felt represented. I felt like my story is being told, even though it’s not exactly mine. Right now it’s #3 is the u.s., which means people are watching this, and hopefully becoming aware that this is real. It was such a lovely story, it had many great points and a lot of humor while covering the topic.

Please watch if you have the mental space.

g8tb6v,Have I been abused? I struggle to realize the weight of others actions against me and frequently write things off as my fault.,"I’m a 15 year old gay teen from the United States, and I need support. Recently I’ll admit I was feeling horny and logged onto a gay chat cite where I was approached by an older man. I’ve talked with this man before and done explicit things on camera, (yes I know I shouldn’t have) anyway of the three times I’ve engaged with him he’s claimed to have been recording me and taking pictures of me during our cam sessions. He would say “smile for the camera,” and “who’s my little porn star,” I’ve finally realized the weight of my situation and honestly feel a little traumatized. I don’t know if this is the right place to post but I felt too scared to talk to anyone in a non anonymous setting. I regret my choices and recognize it was a mistake to be on any such sight at all (honestly nobody clicks off of porn because they’re under 18 but clearly a sight like that is different as I’ve now come to realize) I just hope I can find support as I’m feeling a little hopeless on what to do.",I_Need_Help_PeriodT,2020-04-26 21:06:03,0,214,48.44,21.34,93.11,18.85,26.75,15.89,93.46,59.81,19.16,14.02,12.15,0.47,0,1.4,0,5.14,6.54,15.89,12.15,4.21,7.01,1.4,21.5,5.14,3.74,1.4,1.4,0.93,7.01,3.27,3.74,0.93,0.47,0.93,7.94,0,0,0,2.34,14.49,6.07,0.47,3.27,1.87,1.4,2.8,5.14,1.4,0.93,2.8,3.27,0.47,0,2.34,0.93,4.21,0.93,0,1.87,0.93,0.47,4.67,15.89,0.93,13.55,1.4,7.01,4.67,0.93,0.93,0,0,0,0,0.93,0,0,0.47,0,0.47,14.95,3.27,1.87,0,0,0.47,0,0,1.87,5.61,1.87,0

g8uk5z,"Is this purposeful abuse, or just someone with anger issues?","Now what I’m about to tell you is undeniably abuse. I know that. I know that hitting someone, or calling someone names, or tearing someone down in almost any circumstance is abusive.... 

But I also feel like there is a difference between someone who enjoys having control and hurting people, and someone who just simply can’t control their anger. 

My fiancé has hit me on multiple occasions. Some occasions where I hit him back or throw things back, and some occasions where I just take it. 

The first time was during an argument that I honestly can’t remember the start of. I have severe abandonment issues, and honestly am pretty mentally ill, so my reaction to arguments is pretty clingy and dramatic. His reaction is to withdrawal normally, and ignore me. He says his reasoning for this is to avoid blowing up. But me being me in this situation, I freaked out and refused to leave him alone, to the point where he had to physically remove me away from him multiple times. I was incredibly persistent, and it ended in me getting smacked pretty hard in the face. It was open palm, but did somehow result in a black eye.

At first he denied hitting me that hard, but as the bruising worsened he felt bad... but in his signature style, it took him at least a week to really whole heartedly apologize and express remorse. 

One other time that sticks out to me was when he thought I stole his Xanax. The cat spilled it the night before (or he did and didn’t remember) and I found it and cleaned it up off the floor so none of the animals would eat it. He woke up several hours after me, and when he saw his pills again, apparently a significant amount was missing (10-15 or so if I remember correctly). I really honestly to this day don’t know if he took them or not, all I know is that he thought I stole them and flushed them... and he was furious. I was sort of angry about him accusing me at first, so I basically told him to fuck off. This set off a fucking atom bomb. After the 3rd or so time of me saying I didn’t steal them, he grabbed me, pushed me to the ground, and started hitting me (open palm) on my head and arms. Then he stood up, and kicked me in the legs a few times (I’m in fetal position at this point). He kept looking for the pills and coming back to where I was, throwing random shit at me every time he’d come back.

He did apologize for this as soon as he calmed down. Actually asked me where I got the bruises, because apparently he didn’t remember even hurting me.

He just blacks out...

The thing is, I love him more than anyone else in this world. He is the sweetest man I’ve ever met when he’s not angry. Very understanding, very generous, and very kind hearted. 

But his fuse is short, and the anger is strong and uncontrollable.

Does this make him a bad person? Or does it make him a person who suffers from illness and needs help?

I love him. I don’t want to leave him. I’m not unhappy with him, I’m just unhappy with that side of him. I’m not afraid of him, it just hurts my heart when he gets like that. 

Am I able to help him overcome this? He says he’d be willing to go to anger management.",thrwawy86376501,2020-04-26 22:37:53,0,607,17.68,40.24,60.33,1,14.8,15.98,93.74,61.78,23.89,16.97,8.57,0,0.16,7.41,0.82,6.92,4.28,12.03,7.91,7.41,9.06,1.98,18.29,3.79,2.14,2.14,0.99,2.31,8.07,2.14,5.77,0.49,2.47,1.65,14,0,0,0,7.58,14,2.47,1.65,0.99,4.94,0.82,5.44,2.64,0.66,0.49,1.32,3.79,1.48,1.15,0.33,0.82,6.43,0.82,1.15,2.64,1.65,0.49,6.26,9.56,0.49,14.5,1.32,7.91,5.93,0.16,0.33,0,0,0,0,0.66,0.66,0,0,0,0,17.3,7.58,4.94,0,0,0.66,0,0.16,0,2.64,1.32,0

g8w2do,I don't know where the line is anymore,"Over the last few years my dad has medicated his arthritis pain with alcohol. He's become a progressively more nasty person. Nowadays he will shout all kinds of racial slurs, dirty words, and misogynistic comments while also yelling at me to work harder around the house. I'm 27, have a college degree but my job doesn't pay enough to make rent so I live with my dad and pay what I can to help out. My less than perfect income is something that bothers my dad, and he often tells me I need to make more money and that my worth as a person is determined by my pay.

Yesterday crossed a new line. My dad called my lazy and worthless because I couldn't find napkins in the house. We were totally out of them. Then he made me go to the store for more (during the coronavirus lockdown) and to get him more bourbon. Then he proceeded to scream at me about how women are lesser because they aren't mandated to sign up for the draft. I was so scared and panicked by the time he left me alone for the night that I packed a Go Bag in the event that I'm finally forced to run away for my safety. I hope I'm doing enough to protect myself.

 My dad has never physically assaulted me, but focuses on negging, and emotional/physical abuse of making me feel like garbage by pointing out my flaws and putting me down. 

 I don't know if I'm supposed to ask questions or for comfort or if I'm doing the right thing by being ready to flee. I never feel safe at home, and because of the lockdown I have to spend more time at home than ever when it scares me.",SpiritfoxAMF,2020-04-27 00:34:41,3,307,46.57,16.42,87.87,3.7,19.19,14.33,90.88,58.31,18.89,15.96,12.38,0.33,0,2.61,0.65,2.93,5.54,15.96,8.79,4.56,9.12,2.28,16.61,6.51,3.58,1.3,0.33,2.61,6.84,2.28,4.56,0.98,1.63,0.65,7.82,1.63,0,0.33,4.23,12.7,2.61,2.93,1.63,2.93,1.95,3.26,2.28,0,0.98,1.3,2.28,0,2.28,0,0.33,5.54,0.65,0.98,2.28,0.65,1.3,2.28,13.36,1.3,14.01,1.63,5.86,6.51,2.28,0.33,1.63,2.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.73,4.89,2.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.58,0.65,0.33
g8y3n9,Bf says he wants to hit me,"Bf threatens to hit me calls me stupid

My bf and I get in small fights. Lately we have had fleas from our cats and we bought everything in the planet to help get rid of them. An exterminator is coming in two days. He is especially mad because he gets bit by them and I do not. We got in a fight tonight while I tried to make the bed with fresh sheets but put them on the floor briefly since we don’t have carpet and I needed to take everything off the bed. He raged and called me a Fucking idiot and said I didn’t take the situation seriously. I’ve been cleaning non stop and doing what I can to help until the exterminator arrives. The fight got so bad that he attacked me and threw me on the floor. I hit him because I was scared (he has choked me out before) he said that he never meant to hurt me but he’s just upset and is itchy from the bugs. I’ve tried to help. When he was angry he kept punching the pillow by my head and kept saying “this is how I would punch you if I actually did”. He’s strong and it would hurt. He’s not dumb enough to actually do it. Plus, we are definitely passionate about each other. Been together 4 years. It’s a difficult situation but do other bfs act like this? Punch near the head and call their gfs stupid? I’m honestly trying to wrap my head around this behavior. I am used to violence from my childhood so I’m not sure if I’m being bullied or I’d everyone has fights like this. I grab my throat every time we get in a fight because I don’t want to be choked.

I started to call and text him for hour and a half and he must have had his phone on silent, but me being paranoid now and not hearing from him I’m hurt, in tears, than I get blindsided with him FaceTiming me with this girl (dude) and I feel real hurt as I didn’t want her to see me crying and so I was pissed and I covered the camera because he ignored me than had the nerve to FaceTime me. Also, he said he’d be home before 10 he didn’t come home until 12 than he was non-responsive. Now he’s saying that I embarrassed him and I told him he embarrassed me it’s been two days and he’s still upset with me. I am at a loss for words and don’t know what to do at this point. Also, he curses at me and gets verbally abusive and he’s telling me f**k me and b**ch and I am embarrassing. 14 years together I don’t know what to do.

g9648h,I just want to get this off my chest.,"My life has been nothing but crazy to say the least. Before I was even born my father told my mother to abort me or he left. She picked me obviously. He however went on to have two more children, girls, who don't even know about me. 

My early childhood was very good. I honestly don't recall much bad in those early years. When I turned 9, everything changed. My mom got with a guy who seemed to be wonderful but over the years (up until two ish years ago) would sexually abuse me. Touch me in places, rub his junk on me, tell me he wanted to have sex. This went on for so long and I am deeply traumatized. 

Having a father who didn't want you and being sexually abused by someone who you looked up too makes for no the best experience with men. As if that wasn't enough, I dated a boy who mentally, verbally, and sexually abused me all within six months. 

Those men are all out of my life and thank god. Now however, my mom is with someone who sucks and it's pretty much impossible to have any surplus money because of him. He's honestly up there on the list of men that have ruined something in my life.

She's always high and she still try's to make my day great but it's hard when she's constantly high or smoking cigarets. She has also made it very clear when I finish highschool (the end of next year) that I'm to attend university right away. My plan was to attend university but I wanted to take year off.

I wanted to explore the world. Meet different people and see different cites. I wanted to know there's more to life than sitting in a classroom 5 days a week. I wanted to know if my dreams I have are something I can actually do rather than get a job I might not like in 5 years. But no, I'm attending university right after.

I guess my past and present are all a bit much right now and honestly I just want to be happy but I can't when I'm not even allowed to explore and learn more about the world. 

I don't want to be controlled anymore. I want to be the person I've always aspired to be but never could become.",psychological_girl,2020-04-27 11:16:06,2,406,25.78,16.84,94.85,34.31,15.04,11.33,96.55,58.62,19.46,14.04,10.84,0,0.49,2.71,0,5.42,3.69,14.04,10.84,6.65,7.88,2.96,20.69,5.91,3.2,2.46,1.48,2.96,4.43,2.46,1.97,0,0.99,0.25,9.85,1.23,0.25,2.22,3.2,17.73,2.22,1.97,3.94,3.2,2.46,5.91,1.97,0.74,0.25,0.74,2.71,0.25,1.23,0.99,0.49,4.93,0.25,0.49,2.71,1.72,0.25,6.16,15.02,0.49,18.47,2.22,7.39,8.87,1.72,0.25,0,0.25,0.25,0,0.25,0.25,0,0,0,0,14.29,6.65,2.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.19,0.99,0

g9868a,Dealing live with constant abuse,"I just wanted to get this off my chest, i haven't talked about this with many people, just the 5 therapists that I visited since I was 6 years old. I was a happy child until six, when my father, after a travel to the US, suddenly changed and stared to abuse me verbally and physically, always when I had homework, he made me do it with him, and if I got wrong one answered he beated me pretty bad, this made me very anxious when I had homework because I knew that I will get beat up. Anxiety made it worst, one day he beated me until I got unconscious because of a wrong answer, I was very nervous and I didn't think well. This made me very depressed, and kids at school started to notice that and began to bully me, I changed school and still the heavy bullying was there and I was sexually abused by classmates, something that made me have a kind of PTSD, imagine living hell in school and at home my parents didn't believed me when I said that I had been though a lot in that school, I always told my mother to change me to other school, she didn't listen until one of my sisters got bullied too and my father saw the whole thing... I got a very hard depression when my grandma died, I was 12, she was like my mother to me, because she was the only person of my family that didn't treated me like shit. That same year I attempted suicide, my parents stopped me and they sent me to a psychiatrist, and a psychologist. My parents constantly blamed me in front of the therapists because I didn't speak to them, because I was lazy and exaggerated. Both my parents are very narcissistic, when the therapists told them, that their attitude with me might be part of the problem, they just looked for another therapist that told them what they wanted to hear... They never found that therapist. I remember that my father beated me because I was depressed, one of the things he said to me was ""be happy or I will beat the shit out of you more"" I'm not joking. I hate my father since then, he has been always a piece of shit with me, he has a construction company, I had to work with him since I was ten, he is very narcissistic and I'm thinking that maybe he is a sociopath. I attempted suicide seven times in my childhood, the psychiatrist told me that I might have maniac depressive disorder, and began to treat me with pills, my mother (that is very abusive too, but at least has empathy, a big difference with my father) she didn't want me to have medication for whatever reason, until I began to have terrible anxiety attacks and other suicide attempts and I started with medication, that made me very numb. When I was 15 I changed school, and they treated me nice, but I was very out of touch with reality. I began to be happy there, have friends and even a girlfriend. But abuse at home wasn't over, my father beated me until I was 17, because of grades, I have never been a great student. Father and my mother now abuse me verbally, and very constantly. But I was very lucky that I found a good psychologist that helped me a lot, I managed to stop using medication last year (I'm 23) and I felt that my depression was something past. But nothing is perfect, I study psychology ironically, just because I wanted to understand myself a bit more... My motivation in the career stared to go down, I realized that I'm a patient, not a therapist. This made me depressed again, my future is uncertain, I have no motivation for anything, and coronavirus just made it way worse, now I have to deal with my parents constant verbal abuse everyday, I can't have therapy... I only rely on my girlfriend, who is sick with this fucking virus, fortunately, she doesn't have bad symptoms. I am thinking of suicide again constantly, and even thinking about doing terrible things to my father, I really hate the guy and with his abuse it's making it worst... I'm scared if I snap someday, I hope not... I live in a third world country, mental health is taboo, and the virus is hitting very, very hard so quarantine could be all year for us... I don't know anything about my future. 
I just hope things change, I just want a peaceful live and get out of this family, I want peace, just a bit...

g99j78,What can I do about my cousin who bullies and threatens me?,"I’m 15 and a sophomore. My cousin, Averee, is 19 and a senior. We go to the same school. My parents refuse to do anything about the bullying. Same with my school. Cousin is banned from our house but still finds ways to torment me at school and online.

Incidents that have happened:

Averee had my phone number, and she spoofed my number and started texting people around my school all these threats and was being mean and nasty to people. I got called to the principal because people told on me and I showed the principal I didn’t send any of those texts. My parents went to the police and they traced it back to my cousin. But my parents didn’t press charges, why idk. They just banned her from our house. She pretty much didn’t get in trouble and I got a new number. 

She was on my bus and started showing everyone my YouTube channel making fun of it and people on my bus started kicking the back of my seat and Averee tripped me a few times while I was getting off the bus. They put me on a completely different bus after Averee pepper sprayed me for no reason. 

Averee made up lies saying that I stole her boyfriend, I was pregnant and had miscarriages, I have sex with all the guys in her grade, I have STD’s, that I’m a lesbian, that I have sex with my dog, just all these random things and the sad thing is people believed it and I sat alone at lunch a lot. She also made fun of me at lunch when I would walk by her table to get my food, she would loudly point at me and yell all these mean things. 

She also liked to go to the principals office and make up all these elaborate lies about me to get me in trouble or make these fake accounts of me on social media saying I’m bullying her or whatever. She clogged the toilets at our school and somehow I got blamed for that. 

She took pictures of my room when I wasn’t home one time which was a mess at the time and posted them all over the internet with rude captions and she used to make fun of me because I have clothes from kohl’s and target and not Abercrombie and hollister. She also made fun of the fact that my house is a condo and she lives in an actual house with a pool. Started making up all these rumors about how poor my family was and how my parents are drug addicts. She made fun of me at school in front of everyone.

She made fun of me in gym class because I had sketchers and not Nike shoes. And she purposely broke into my locker and put sticky slime all over my clothes. 

I literally have no friends because of her and everyone thinks I’m the one who has issues. She makes my life a living hell and nobody will do anything. 

Anyways, Averee tried to trick me recently in pretending to be our cousin with a fake account of my cousin. I could tell it was Averee and I told it off, I said :

Averee, I know this is you. This is pathetic that you are pretending to be Cheyenne in order to talk to me. I don’t want anything to do with you. Why are you so obsessed with me? You need mental help. You aren’t normal. This isn’t funny or cute. It’s stalkerish and creepy. You do know impersonating someone is illegal right? I don’t want to talk to you. I’m sick of all the drama. Leave me alone, Get a life and stay out of mine. This is ridiculous.

There’s a relationship in my life that I used to feel was extremely important, but recently only triggers memories of abuse as they’ve become verbally and emotionally abusive as of late. 

Is there anything I can do to proactively redirect this relationship back to healthy, or should I abandon it entirely? 

They know I was abused in the past yet still resort to verbal/emotional abuse including silent treatments like my mother once had done. Is this a sign they are intentionally doing it or am I reading too deeply?

g9d89e,apathy being used as a defense mechanism,"tw. slight mention of suicide and sexual assault

tl;dr: my girlfriend uses apathy as a defense mechanism and i’d appreciate any tips or advice on how to cope with trauma, how to better process things, or how to ground urself from (possible) dissociation and apathy. 

hey, so my girlfriend has a verbally abusive mom who neglects her and her brothers, and used to be physically abusive towards them. she has a history of trauma with sexual assault by several older men, and evidently trauma from her mom’s abuse. 

she’s always had trouble accepting that her mom was abusive (and is still in denial about it sometimes, as most abused kids are) until recently when she’s started accepting it a bit more and more. 

her depression started getting worse lately, and so did her mom. my girlfriend has always used apathy as a defense mechanism (feeling apathetic towards situations that have hurt her and her trauma. repressing all of her emotions and struggling with regulating them), but it’s gotten worse. 

she’s beginning to feel apathetic towards all of her emotions again (not accepting them) and dissociates when she feels an emotion too strongly and has trouble processing a lot of things. for example, i recently told her that i was giving her a 2ds, and she didn’t process it until a few days later and had a really bad dissociative episode when i told her. 

i think she’s been dissociating constantly as well, she’s described feeling as though nothing is real, everything seems fake. she said that when something bad has happened, she knows that it’s bad and knows she’s supposed to feel something towards it, but doesn’t. she’s also said that she could kill herself and nothing would happen because it doesn’t feel real. 

i went through this same thing a year ago, and it was really bad. i could’ve screwed up my life if i hadn’t gotten better with it. she doesn’t want to become apathetic either, and i don’t want to see her go through this. are there any tips on how to process things easier, or better deal with trauma, or just overcome this dissociation and apathy? any help is super super super appreciated.",noahbord88,2020-04-27 17:44:26,0,375,13.28,67.48,5.13,1,19.74,22.13,93.07,55.47,18.93,12,3.47,0,0,7.73,0.8,6.93,3.2,11.2,10.67,6.13,12.8,2.4,19.73,7.2,5.6,2.4,0,3.47,15.47,4,10.67,0.53,2.4,0.8,14.13,1.33,0.8,8.8,0.53,16.27,4.27,2.4,1.6,4.27,2.13,3.47,2.67,0.27,0.53,1.87,1.6,0,0.8,0.8,0,8.8,1.33,1.87,2.13,1.6,2.93,6.67,11.47,0,9.33,0.53,2.4,6.4,0.27,0,0,0,0,0.53,0.8,0.27,0,0,0.27,0,17.07,4.53,4.8,0.27,0.27,0.27,0,0,0,4.8,2.13,0

g9goo2,I feel like I may have been emotionally abused by teachers as a kid.,"So to start off I'm 20 years old now. This all started when I was maybe six or seven to age twelve or thirteen. I grew up in a very loving and supportive family. However due to my  ADD, and trouble in math I spent all of my elementary school years in Special ed. I remember ever since kindergarten I had a teacher in special ed who would always mock me if I was say walking down the hallway in a weird way she would show all of the other kids how I walked and make all of them do it too, that's pretty much all I remember from kindergarten but it's always stuck with me. 
 
Then when I started first grade, I got an all new set of special ed teachers. I had one who would yell at all of us if we got anything wrong. Which only made me hate whatever subject they were teaching more. 

Then I had another teacher who would make fun of us if we got anything wrong. 
I did fine in all of the other classes and had good relationships with all of my other teachers. I think it was around like fourth grade when I started comparing myself to others constantly. I felt like I wasn't good enough to be friends with any of the other kids. I would always have a Para sitting next to me during class. Then I started noticing the other kids treating me differently. They would treat me like I was a toddler or something like I couldn't handle any negative criticism, it was like they all tried to be my friends because they felt sorry for me. 

I even remember having to play basketball at another basketball goal with the kids in special ed class while the other kids played basketball on the other side of the gym. 

I just never felt like I was good enough as a kid. Then My family and I moved away to be closer to the rest of our family, and I started homeschooling. Everything went great I graduated with good grades. I'm living a pretty great life now. I still occasionally struggle with social anxiety, and hate being the center of attention. 

I've secretly forgiven those teachers. I'm sure they were just doing what they thought was right. I also know that the majority of teachers are awesome and genuinely love their jobs and the kids they work with. I would just like to know of anyone has experienced anything similar and could give me advice.",Unlikely-Tiger,2020-04-27 21:39:37,2,441,37.53,29.3,92.65,68.56,16.96,16.1,96.15,59.18,21.54,14.74,11.34,1.13,0,0.23,2.04,6.8,4.99,14.06,9.75,4.99,7.26,0.91,19.05,4.99,3.17,2.27,1.81,4.08,8.16,5.22,2.95,0.45,1.36,0.23,9.75,0.68,0.45,0.23,0,17.46,3.4,1.36,2.72,4.08,3.85,4.08,1.81,0.23,0.45,0.91,0.68,0,0.45,0,0,10.2,3.17,0.91,3.17,2.49,0.68,8.84,7.03,1.13,13.83,1.13,4.99,7.71,5.22,2.27,0.68,0.23,0,0,0.23,0,0,0.23,0,0,9.07,5.9,1.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.81,0,0
g9k8at,Does what my dad has done to me count as a abuse?,"So this might be long. There’s going to be details of multiple occupancies here, because I think it’s important in this case to know all the events that led up to this. 

I’ll preface this by saying I have ADHD and when I was a kid I was very hyper and disobedient. I also did not like my dad and was kind of afraid of him. He was always at work and got angry fairly easily. So here’s what happened first; my sister and I shared a room and being the hyper kid I was I would often keep her up. If my parents couldn’t get my to go to sleep, my dad would carry me to our guest room kicking and screaming and lock me in there until I tired myself out. This was fairly traumatic for me as like I said, I was afraid of my dad. It made me much more afraid of him and whenever it was suggested I go do something with him alone I would cry, thinking I was in trouble for something. At one point I pissed him off and he said something along the lines of “What, so you want me to spank you?” And then proceeded to hit me. I don’t remember this hurting, but I remember it nonetheless. So all that led to me convincing my brain that I wanted to be hurt/punished. Around the same time this happened my dad exposed his genitals to my sister and I. I do not remember why this happened, but I know that it was intentional and in a public bathroom. He just showed us, it went no further than that. 

One thing about my dad that has been consistent my entire life is that my dad has zero filter, he just says shit with no regard for who he’s speaking to. He would often (and still does) day sexual things in front of me, as far back as I can remember. So often that as I got older and began to understand what these things meant, I would actively avoid interacting with him to avoid these things. One notable example is when I was fourteen years old. I found his pot grinder in his office and later while in the car asked him what it was, and not wanting to tell me what it was he informed me that it was something for his fetish. This made me incredibly uncomfortable and as soon as I got home I told my mom what happened and immediately started crying. He constantly says inappropriate things to/near me, and I do not want to be around him. As soon as I get to close to him he does something awful.

Due to all these I strongly dislike him and rarely interact with him, I intend to move out as soon as quarantine is over now that I’m eighteen. I apologize that this is so long. I’m sure there’s more that I could have shared, but these are the things that spring to mind. I’d really appreciate people sharing their thoughts on this.",uhhidkthrowaway,2020-04-28 02:36:53,3,528,7.71,37.37,63.73,4.56,18.21,12.88,95.27,65.72,28.6,17.99,12.5,0.38,0.38,4.55,0.19,10.61,1.89,13.83,10.42,6.82,9.47,1.33,20.64,4.92,3.6,2.27,1.33,1.52,5.87,1.89,3.98,1.14,0.95,0.95,11.93,2.08,0.19,0.76,5.68,11.55,2.84,1.52,2.27,2.46,1.14,1.7,1.89,0.19,1.33,0.38,1.7,0.95,0.38,0.57,0,5.49,1.89,0.38,1.7,0.95,0.57,8.52,9.09,1.33,12.88,1.7,5.49,5.87,0.57,0.19,0.76,0,0,0,0.38,0.38,0,0,0,0,11.74,5.11,2.84,0,0.19,0.38,0,0,0.38,2.08,0.38,0.38

g9m7mw,Why me?,"Well I'd like to tell my story and try to understand why this has affected me and not my brother and sister.

So I am a triplet (I have a brother and a sister the same age as me) and I feel that all the abuse has affected me way more than it has affected my siblings. My mom (who is a human rights activist) was very abusive, she used to insult us a lot from a young age ( she would call us motherfuckers, son of a bitch, assholes, and other spanish insults). She did this to me more than she did to my siblings mainly because I had the worst grades. She used to pull my hair a lot, twist my arms, she used to threathen me a lot, more than once she made my sister look for one of her belts so that she could hit me with it ( she told me to lift my shirt so that she could hit my bare skin while she screamed at me and told me she wanted to kill me), once she got really upset over a gitar and she decided to hit me in the head with it so hard that ot broke on my head, she used to tie us up in chairs with belts so that we would eat our entire plates, I was 12 when she decided to come completly naked to my room just to yell at me, she used to leave us alone in the house with a housekeeper for days because she told us that she would rather be with her boyfriend than with us and she only came home to take us to school ( complaning). The only reason she stopped hitting me and my siblings was because our housekeeper told her that it was enough and that she should stop, and also because my dad took us to live with him because she was seriouly neglecting us.

My dad was really agressive verbally and phisically. Every time I got home with a bad grade he would yell at me, insult me and throw things at me ( usually books), everytime I did something he considered wrong he would treathened me with beating me up. I was terrified of my dad.

The thing is that nowadays I'm the only one that seems to be affected by this. My sister worships my parents and they even laugh when they remember these things. She's practically becoming a clone of my mom and she says she admires her. My brother doesn't have too much contact with my parents but when he does they seem to get along. I seem to be the only one that doesn't find those memories funny at all. I've tried to let it all behind but it seems impossible because my parents don't want to change.

g9mkpd,Was it abuse/rape ? I don't know what to think,"In 2017, I (F/ 15 at the time) had a boyfriend (M/15 at the time). 

He was the first boy I had sex with and I was the one who suggested we have sex. 

But as the relationship progressed, he got very insistant about sex. If I said no about having sex with him, he would sulk (it happened multiple times and sometimes I would give in and say yes). One time, I told him we could have sex but specified I didn't want him to penetrate me. I don't remember how he got inside of me but I kind of froze and he only ""stayed inside me"" a minute or so, saw I was looking at him angrily and stopped. After that, I just layed on the bed and cried a bit. He asked me ""I didn't rape you, did I?"" (I didn't answer). 

I don't know what to think about this, was it rape ? It only lasted a minute and he stopped when he saw I wasn't pleased but I still feel like it should not have happened at all. I also feel like I can't say it was rape because he stopped when he saw I wasn't ok with that. I never talked about this with him. I see that this has kind of impacted my sexual life in the sense that most of the time, I am scarred to say no to my partner when it comes to sex because I don't want to upset them. I am also scarred to not please them enough in bed. I feel like an idiot for letting this minor event impact my life so many years after it happened. I don't feel like it was rape but I really don't know what to think. 

I hope I explained the situation clearly. If anyone could give me their opinion/advice about this situation, it would be very appreciated.

g9na3h,My relationship with my parents,"I admit that I may not have been the best child. I used to take things that weren't mine and because of this I was severely punished by mother, but she wouldn't just punish me for things that I actually deserved. Sometimes I'd get punished for things that had nothing to with me. I never realized at the time, but she would take out her stressful days on me.
She'd come home with an issue at work and the next I knew I was running from her and the belt. Whenever she caught me, and she always did, she would beat me until I had welts on my skin and sometimes she would slap me across the face. I can remember one time in particular when she tortured my brother and I over a bar of soap. She had us both in the corner, beating us and then threatening to call the police on us; and where was our father?...well he went to play with his friends. He was almost never around when she started beating us. Sometimes when he was actually present he'd make a fuss because we were disturbing his TV. Wow.
As time went on my brother got less and less, even though he never got much from her to begin with. My mother would look for any reason to inflict her wrath on me and the entire time I thought I was a horrible human being, completely deserving of what was happening to me.
She didn't just destroy me with her physical abuse but her verbal and emotional abuse. On a daily abuse she would tell me that I was ugly and nasty and disgusting. She would blame every little thing she could on me and I believed her. I believed her when she told me that I was cause of our financial problems and my father's cancer. 
When I started highschool the beating ceased, but I was constantly made to feel like less than I was and there was no one I could turn to. I had no friends that I could trust and my father was a spineless passive who would never stand up to her...I don't ever think he cares about what happens to me.
I think the worst part about all of this was the fact that I didn't realize what was happening to me. I didn't realize that I was being abused, instead I thought that I was being punished for bad behaviour...I thought all the terrible things that happened to the family were my fault and I cannot express enough how much I hate my parents for making me think that.",Camnonb,2020-04-28 06:34:35,0,449,9.1,32.01,66.81,1,20.41,14.7,96.88,66.15,27.17,22.05,13.36,1.56,0,7.13,0,5.12,4.23,12.03,11.36,6.24,7.8,3.34,20.49,3.34,2,2.67,0.45,2.67,7.13,1.34,5.79,0.89,3.34,0,13.81,2.23,0.45,5.79,2.9,15.59,3.56,2,2.67,1.34,2.9,3.34,0.67,0.22,0,0.45,1.34,0.45,0.45,0,0.45,9.58,3.34,0.67,3.56,1.34,1.56,10.02,5.79,0.45,13.14,1.56,4.45,7.13,0.89,1.34,0.45,0.22,0,0,0.22,0,0,0,0.22,0,11.36,6.68,2,0,0.22,0.22,0,0,0,2.23,0,0
g9o76p,Some advice?,"A couple of weeks ago I was discarded by my toxic narcissistic friend in a pretty brutal way. He utilised my fears against me. I came to this sub and received such brilliant support and advice, I am so grateful and would love to be able to return the favour. Even if this only helps one person. Disclaimer, he was only an online friend but it still hurt. Long post, sorry!
What helped me most - 
1. Changing how I thought about him. I made the mistake to keep considering him a friend. That's how I would refer to him so he remained as that in my mind for too long. When I changed how I referred to him, I felt a lot better. Because ultimately, someone who intentionally hurts you shouldn't be given the title of friend, bf etc. 
2. Changing how I saw him. I created an image of a hologram version of him with his real self stood behind it. The hologram was charming, friendly and everything I wanted and the original ""person"" I had met. The abuser was stood behind it, the real him. Everytime I would hold onto or reach for the ideal him, I literally imagined myself grabbing thin air. Because that's all it was/is, an illusion. With his venomous malicious smile in full view as I tried. This personally helped me a lot to realise the reality of things. To correct the lies I was telling myself. 
3. Researching. Once I looked up traits of narcissists and tactics, everything seemed to become clearer. Yes, it definitely hurt. But I was seeing that this was all on him. He had chosen to treat me that way and that I wasn't alone. 
4. My loss? I kept telling myself I'd lost something great. A friend I loved and cared about. Then I snapped out of my thinking. No. I'd lost an abuser. How was that a loss? It wasn't. It was a gain. He didn't consider me a loss so why should I? This made me feel a little power. 
5. Closure. Possibly the hardest part for me was not getting the closure I so desired. He left me muted so I never knew if he'd read my messages or not. It was a cruel game. I'd convinced myself I could only get closure through engaging with him. That's exactly what they want and why they leave it that way. It was another way of hurting me. I decided I wouldn't give so much power. That maybe I didn't need closure on something so toxic. Closure was perhaps another illusion? I needed to look inside of myself to truly gain it.
6. Being selfish. After all the treading on eggshells, jumping at new texts and crying from the pain - I decided to be selfish. To treat myself to what I wanted to do. To what I deserved. It felt foreign at first, wrong even. Until I remembered that was his voice/opinion NOT mine. So I took up new hobbies, indulged in my favourite foods and didn't feel bad. I started living for me, without him. To prove I could and it felt great. 

Overall, it's like an injection. No one wants it but once that small moment of pain is over, you are immune for a while. It will hurt but it's worth it. If you can, get out now. Go no contact. Just do it. You can do it, I promise ♥️ thank you for reading",hieveryonehowareya,2020-04-28 07:28:56,0,584,20.4,24.66,56.08,25.77,8.34,16.44,92.64,60.1,24.66,16.1,11.3,0,0.86,3.6,0.34,8.56,5.48,11.47,9.25,5.82,7.19,2.57,19.35,3.25,1.2,2.23,1.88,2.05,9.08,4.45,4.45,0.17,0.86,2.23,9.59,0,1.37,0,3.77,17.64,4.28,2.74,3.42,3.25,2.23,3.42,3.6,1.03,0.17,2.4,1.71,0,1.03,0,0.34,7.02,2.23,2.23,1.03,1.71,0.86,9.42,5.99,0.51,9.93,1.37,5.14,3.42,0.34,0.34,0,0.17,0,0,0.34,0,0.17,0.17,0,0,19.01,10.79,3.42,0,0,0.86,0.17,0.34,0.34,2.74,0,0.34

g9qvzz,What to do if one of your parents is abusing the other?,"I’m an adult but have noticed a disturbing trend of my mother emotionally and psychologically abusing my father as he gets older. My father used to fight back but she’s taken it to the point where he seems very broken down.

She’s a gaslighter and will throw fits and tantrums if I try to step in. She gives gifts and hugs that make me feel sick whenever she’s angry at my father for something in order to get me on her side.

My dad hasn’t been allowed to do anything he wants for so long. Recently she changed her religion on a whim and now throws a fit whenever my father prays or does anything like he has done for the past 35 years. He can’t even say the name of his god because my mother will leave the room. At the same time she forces him to participate in her new religion and mocks him for still believing in the religion they both got married under.

She will root through his things and tell him to “guess” if something’s wrong. She will act outrageous and instantly look at him like a he’s done nothing. I will be standing in the same room and she will act like both of us hallucinated. Everything she does feels sinister and selfish, but since she’s a coward she always acts so there’s plausible deniability. 

She will give him elaborate gifts and withhold her affection if things don’t go her way.

If I do something nice for him she will cut me off or even hide or destroy my gifts. 

Her affection sickens me. Every time she hugs me it’s empty and cold I feel like I want to puke. There’s always an ulterior motive. She does this to everyone and plays favorites but since my dad is stuck with her I feel especially bad.

As his child, I’m not sure what to do.

g9s01a,My Life Off My Chest Pt 1,"I hope you all don't mind me just getting things off my chest. Things long in the past that I can't forget; that my head won't let me forget. A series of short to long memories of events. It might help me, it might not...but I need to try. I hope it doesn't anger or annoy anybody...

So to start off, I'm not sure what to call this series, but I'm pretty sure the name doesn't matter if it's all just about abuse. However, if anybody has a good name for it, I'm open to change. Also, parts aren't going to be in chronological order, but I'm thinking of writing a book or something, so it helps just writing them down in any order.

 This part is a part of my childhood, just one day at my second primary school in Year 5 (4th Grade to you awesome Americans). I went to three different primary schools, each doing things a little differently. This school had classrooms containing two different class Years, apart from Reception. So it goes: Reception, Year 1 &amp; 2, Year 3 &amp; 4, Year 5 &amp; 6.

 My brother was a year older than me, so we were in the same classroom for a year. Him and his friends bullied me a lot, as if it weren't bad enough at home. Although, my brother was rarely nice to me, which were good times. Anyway, we went into school one day, and we had a subject to do in groups. I chose to be in a group with my brother, who was okay with it but not happy. I suffered with my social skills, and nobody wanted me in their group and would be horrible to me, so I had no choice but to be in my brother's group, which had his friends in from his Year. I remember my brother's friends talking about their dads and how they get punished, like hav8ng their consoles taken away etcetera. I...well, I said out loud what dad does to me, and everyone went quiet and were shocked. I thought being hit by your dad was normal, so it seemed okay to say so. One of my brother's friends said ""you probably shouldn't say that, your brother's in our group"" or something along those lines. I replied with ""it's okay, he already knows"". This was 11 years ago, so I don't remember the exact phrasings, but I do remember certain words. Anyway, we got on with the subject and m6 brother didn't say anything...

...until...

 Dad came to pick us up from school, but he'd have to park in the pub car park just up the road. He'd walk down to just outside the school, but across the road from it. We'd cross the road and walk up with him. Then my brother said this: ""'Dregar12' said you hit him"" and some other shit, I was kinda surprised, so I don't remember the rest of what he said. But dad shouted at me, exclaiming ""I hit you, do I?! Well that's it! If you think I hit you, I'm gonna start hitting you from now on!"". I was crying my fucking eyes out. He hit me all the time! I was so afraid that it would get worse. The funny thing is, nobody around paid any attention. Also, there was a big sign on the school gate with the Childline advert and number on, that I saw every school day. I even thought of call8ng it a few times, but I was afraid I'd be taken away and lose my mother. My brother CHOSE to tell my dad and make things for me even worse than they already were! He got special treatment all the fucking time, so he didn't have to fear dad at all. If he did anything wrong, it was a quick and simple ""'Dregar12's Brother' no!"". For me it was ""Go to your room!"" and ""I'll give you something to cry about!"" then I'd get the slipper or the back of his hand.

g9u9z8,Ending the relationship with my parents in the future,"Both of my parents drink alcohol to deal with their problems. My dad drinks every day but he's never been abusive. He's emotionally cut off and when my mom becomes verbally abusive when she's drunk he ignores it. He used to try and comfort my sister and I or would remove us from the situation when my mother would direct her abuse towards us. My dad stopped doing that after I had to call 911 in order to prevent them both from physically fighting. He doesn't really know how to help people anymore. He doesn't do anything if my mom is abusive towards my sister or I, he just goes to bed and ignores it. He's very emotionally distant when I talk to him about my problems and my mother doesn't know how to handle them either.

My parents still continue to drink and refuse to get help. I have a lot of anger towards both of them, my mother has apologized for her behavior but continues it. I can't just forget the pain either and they want me to forgive them and move on. I can't just move on and I plan on cutting off contact with my parents after I'm financially stable enough to do so. I don't know if that is the right thing to do since my parents would never forgive me. My mother has told me that if I ever did anything like that to her then she would disown me.

ga0f4f,Feeling stuck,"Im a 19 yr old female and I live with my parents and that’s a normal thing where I live but what’s not normal is living by yourself since it’s portrayed as a shady and shameful thing. Thing is, ever since I can remember I was subjected to verbal and physical abuse by my parents ever since I was child it was always due to silly matters and I was never really happy and grew up being depressed and anxious. My parents treated me well in days and then make my life a living hell the next day. I wanted to run away at the age of 7 only. Today I’m 19 and I never felt any change in fact I’ve become more fearful for my life than ever before . My mom has these crazy mood swings that would shift to the point of her spewing mean things about how I deserve bad things to happen to me, that I deserve to rot in hell etc... and sometimes she casually throws in the fact that I should just kill my self. I do nothing cruel to her I get good grades I’m helpful around the house and I’m a really quiet person but she always sees my tiny mistakes and makes them into the biggest problem. The way she twists her face when she’s mad at me Is so scary I could swear she was the devil . She would threaten to kill me beat me up with whatever she could grab humiliate me and lie about things about me to other people to victimize herself. I would try to isolate myself from her as much as I can but I could never she would send my siblings to bang on my door. She would call me multiple times for me to “hang out” with her when really she’d just scream at me. I got used to days me in my room starving because I’m too scared to leave my room to get beat up again. She would also purposely starve me a lot. My dad never does anything to stop her. He supports everything she’s doing to me. I feel so lonely and helpless I can’t call anyone there’s nowhere to go to and I cant escape my situation.

ga0fcw,I think my mother may have made me unable to function,"throwaway because...yeah.

I do not know what the hell my life is. It feels normal but I am checked out and scared all of the time. I used to have mental energy and I feel like my brain has rotted. I have started to think about things and I have been spiraling.

My mom makes me feel insane.

My mother loves me. She loves me. I cannot for the life of me believe that she doesn't. she took me to dance lessons all of my life. She dressed me and fed me and told me I looked beautiful every once in a while. However she was pretty blunt about my lack of talent, but still supported me going for some reason.

She has mental health issues. She was abused by her own mother. For a massive amount of my childhood she had horrible mental problems, slept a lot, exploded on us all the time. It was normal for her to explode or burst into tears and hide away for the day. I was always on edge, waiting for the screaming to happen.

I was favored because I was the quietest and never got into trouble, partially because I knew early on  I needed to be happy and keep everyone happy.

She has gotten better mentally, but it didn't mean that was the end.

I can never predict her behavior or reactions to things. On one day if I say I turned in an assignment late she would just be like oh... ok. On another day she would scream so loud the neighbors could hear, while cussing at me, and bang on the walls. I do not know what she will do. I never knew what was ok and what was not ok. Then the next morning it's like nothing happened at all. It is ignored completely.

One time I was just passing to go to bed and she just looked at me and said ""You are so pathetic."" Just casually. I didn't even do anything.

She has called me pathetic so much. and I believe it.

The very, very few times I would breakdown in front of her, she would glare at me, sigh, then lock herself in her room for the rest of the day.

When she found out I was hurting myself she asked ""did you do it to be cool?"" in an almost annoyed voice, then shut herself up in her bedroom. She did not bring it up for months. acted like it didn't happen. When I didn't do well on a little speech she freaked out. When we got home she immediately stormed off to go pour some wine, told me I was pathetic, and stormed off to her room.

She supports my struggle with mental illness yet will call me ridiculous and pathetic when I fail at something because of it. She ignores me one day and smothers me the next. She snooped in my room, found my diaries, and read them all, then confronted me about what I wrote.

She was cold and distant but still loved me and did loving things. It's like I had two different mothers and it scared me. I tried to make her happy every day. I think that's why I was favored a bit. I was obedient and sweet to her all of the time.

She has screamed at me so much I got nauseous and lightheaded. Whenever I feel a sense of anger around her my whole body runs cold and I feel like I am drifting away.

I am distant from everything and everyone. I think from a young age I felt like her love was conditional. I needed to always be happy and keep to myself. now I do not know how to ground myself. I am disconnected because when I do ground myself I just feel afraid and aimless. 

I am living with her and my family right now and I feel completely disconnected from my body. She has already screamed at me once and I am thinking round two is coming so I am locked in my room. My stomach feels like ice and my ears are ringing. I feel so stupid all of the time. She acts like none of it happened or is a big deal so I pretend too.

I keep lying to her about my mistakes because I feel like I have to. I am shutting down I think. sorry if this is incoherent. I don't think this is abuse because she loves me a lot but I needed to write somewhere.",inclouds_1,2020-04-28 18:43:54,1,775,15.61,19.37,87.39,8.71,12.11,13.03,95.1,62.71,23.87,19.61,13.42,0.26,0.26,5.55,0.13,4.13,3.61,12.39,10.45,5.81,8.77,2.19,20.52,5.16,1.68,1.68,0.9,2.71,7.48,2.97,4.39,0.65,1.29,1.16,9.55,0.77,0.13,6.19,0,14.19,4.13,2.06,1.68,1.94,2.58,2.84,4.52,0.52,1.68,2.06,2.71,0.77,0.9,0,0.39,4.65,1.42,0.52,1.68,0.77,0.65,7.61,11.74,1.29,14.71,1.42,6.84,6.45,0.77,0.52,1.16,0,0.13,0,1.29,0.26,0,0.65,0.39,0,12.77,8.65,2.32,0,0,0.13,0,0,0.52,1.16,0,0
ga1ir9,I look just like my abuser 😭,"To make a long story short, my father turned what should have been the best years of my life into a living hell. He molested me repeatedly starting at 2 years old. He tortured my pets. He called my mother and I bitch, cunt, etc. He was always going off having affairs and took no interest in our family other than using my mother and I to take his rage out on.

I’m SO mad at him for bringing me into this world knowing he was just going to torture me and then abandon me as a teenager. Now I have to see his face every single day.

ga332a,Is this abuse?,"Sorry if there are any grammar or spelling errors. 

I need help figuring out if this is abuse. So, one day I spilled nail polish on the bathroom counter, not a big deal, right? Well, my mom asked what happened, and I lied about it because I was afraid she would yell at me.

 So we get into this heated argument since she found out I lied, and then i start having a panic attack because she was yelling at me so much. When I'm having a panic attack, I remember her just looking at me and laughing, telling me that I’m a baby for crying, and just generally making me feel awful. 

Then, I got so panicked that I had to let it out through some form of pain, so I slam my elbow into the wall, which leaves a small dent. 

And then my mom looks at me with pure rage and then she start yelling at me so much. Since she forced me against the wall I couldn't really go anywhere, so then she proceeds to put one of her hands around my neck and choke me for a full 3 seconds. 

I can’t stop thinking about that since( and it’s been about a year). I’m so afraid she’ll do it again. Every time I hear her voice it fills me with pure terror. Every time I hear her footsteps I’m afraid she’ll do it again, or maybe something even worse. But every since then, she’s been really nice to me, so I feel like I don’t have the right to be mad about it.",imtootiredforthis_,2020-04-28 21:50:48,1,271,8.44,17.81,91.27,1,18.07,9.96,94.83,63.47,23.99,18.08,12.92,0.37,0,4.8,0,5.9,4.06,12.18,9.59,9.96,11.44,1.48,19.19,3.69,0.74,1.11,1.11,2.58,9.96,1.11,8.86,2.58,4.43,0.74,8.49,1.11,0,5.54,0,14.02,2.21,2.95,1.85,3.69,1.85,3.69,4.8,0.74,2.58,1.48,1.85,1.11,0.74,0,0,4.43,0.74,0,2.58,0.74,0.74,4.43,9.96,2.95,16.97,1.11,7.75,8.12,0,0.37,0.37,0,0,0,0.37,0,0,0,0.37,0,16.24,4.8,5.9,0,0,0.74,0,0,0,4.06,0.74,0
ga3jnl,There’s something holding me back from calling CPS and I don’t know what it is... (16) (F),"So I live in a very abusive toxic household (more like shack with rats,mice,roaches,sludge, black mould etc...) and basically I’m abused by my father every single day, and have been abused by him since as far back as I can remember. My entire family is against me (my mom, little brother, older brother and all in between...) and my mom told me that if I call the cops she’s ""never fucking talking to me ever again”. My little brother will just straight up look at me and say “I fucking hate you you’re so ugly and disgusting I hope you die you stupid bitch” (he’s 12...), and My older brother (19) agrees with what my dad is doing to me and consistently tells me “you better not call the cops you fucking bitch”. One day, I FINALLY got the courage to tell my grandmother that my dad has been abusing me since I was little and she said: “he abuses all of his girls you’re not fucking special” and that “I just just deal with the abuse” and that “if you call the cops it’s not going to do anything good and that she’s never talking to me again and that everyone will hate me forever if I call the police on my dad”. and I’m always so close to calling the police...and then something in me tells me not to. Something in me gets so afraid. I need help.

ga4lyi,Is it normal for me to be scared of my Dad? Am I being abused?,"**FIRST BEFORE I SAY ANYTHING, IDK IF THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE POSTING, BUT I DONT KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO**

Anyways, this post might be a little long because im basically going to be stating everything that has happened throughout my teenage years, I'm a 14 year old boy btw.

So, when I was little it was normal for my dad to spank my brothers and I with a leather belt whenever we misbehaved. I always hated it and would kick and scream afterwards because it hurt so much (he stopped after I was around 10). But now he resorts to other types of violence whenever I get in trouble; basically he hits me in the jaw, squeezes my hand really tight to where my bones start to ache, and just other stuff like shoving me and pulling my hair really hard. It's gotten to the point where I feel scared to even be near him when he calls out my name. Is that by itself technically abuse? Because ive been looking online and it sounds like it is, but it just sounds weird that my dad might be physically abusing me. idk, i just think i dont wanna come to terms with that..?

I also hate being at the dinner table because thats when my entire family and i have to sit and talk with each other. I have 3 older brothers all over 16 and he constantly humiliates me in front of them, and it feels like he's always going for me since im the youngest. And it's always about the same thing, its about my grades, the way i dress, my hair, how skinny i am and everything in between! I've started to feel more insecure about my appearance recently, and im not sure if its just puberty or my dad. My mom is the only good one in my family, and I feel like shes the only one I can talk to without being judged. I also don't talk about it to my friends because thats just weird to talk about and its hella awkward.

Idk about anything about abuse, it feels like im being abused, but at the same time, idk if this is just a hormone thing and im just being extra emotional about all this...",ShitFartDoodoo69,2020-04-28 23:56:12,2,400,7.37,12,92.75,1,23.53,12.25,95,66,25,16,13.5,0.25,0,2,0.25,9,3.5,14,12,9.75,9.75,2.25,17.75,4.75,3.25,2.25,1.75,1.75,5.5,0.5,5,1.25,2,0.25,8,2.25,0.25,0.25,3.5,11.25,1.75,1.75,1.25,2,2.25,4,4.5,0.5,1,3,1.75,0.75,0.75,0,0.25,4.25,1.5,0.25,1.25,0.75,0.5,2.25,13.75,1.25,13.75,1.5,5.75,6.25,0.25,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,2,0.25,1.5,0,0,1.25,13.25,4,4.75,0,0.25,1,0.25,0,0,1.5,0.5,1
ga5sj2,I'm getting better. But I miss my broken self?,"I've been practicing a ton of mindfulness which I started to help with anxiety. Uncovered a ton of issues. Worked through them. I think I'm practically becoming enlightened along the way...

Been a crazy life.

I keep getting better and seeing the past through a new lens and letting go of issues.

But I miss my old self. Like I actually miss my child victim self. That mentality. The intensity. The longing. All those bad feelings.

I'm getting better but I'm losing my old identity and I miss it.

To the point where I pretty much want to be abused again to make my old self come back as all the growth gets thrown in the trash.

Not going to act on it and plan to wait until it passes.

ga6ftu,I Have a Deep Anger Towards My Mom. Is it Normal?,"My Mom was a single mother my whole life - she raised my brother and I by herself 100%. Our father never was there from day one and he is a narcissistic drug-alcohol addict who I also believe suffer from a form of mental  retardation. 

I was a happy child growing up until I turned 5 - I was abused by both my Stepfather and his son for 4 years. I kept it a secret for awhile being that they both were long gone, but one day it exploded when I turned 12.

Between the age of 10-18, my Mom has only 2 more relationships which wasn’t so great with one involving domestic violence with us (my brother, cousin and I) jumping her boyfriend who was on drugs, and my mom knew because he stole our van one time. Also, we found his crack spoons in our house. That relationship lasted for about two years. 

At the same time, after that guy left, my own blood brother became so abusive towards me to where he tried to kill me throughout the years, and just recently last year it finally came to an end after he attacked my mom instead of me. He used me as a punching bag all the way up to the age of 18. What made him stop was because his friend stopped him from hitting me and I threatened to call the police (which I tried to years ago, but my mom took the phone). 

I get along with my mom, but I have a deep rage. I can’t get out of my head of when I was 5 and she sat on the couch while her husband brutally beat me. Then at night his son would come into my room to sexually assault me. It was terrible, but then years later she did nothing about my brother’s rage.

She expressed to me that he was jealous of me which I believe. In addition to me being abused, my brother was abused my our step brother as well, but he wasn’t beat by our step father or even abused as bad as me. 

In fact, my brother became an abuser and even sexually abused our male cousin when he was a child, and my mom knew about it years before because my brother told her. She didn’t get him help. She just had people pray over him. I don’t even think my brother told her the truth on how long he been doing it to our male cousin (he was doing it for years). She brushed it under the rug and I think my brother didn’t have the tools to deal with it similar to what I endured. 

I beat down myself instead of hurting others and even was in the hospital for suicidal ideation because of the abuse I endured particularly from my brother everyday.

I hate my mom deep down and want to treat her the same way I was because I feel like she could have stopped it. I don’t think she is a bad woman, but I do think she made some terrible decisions. I’m not a bad person, but why did it happen to me? 🤦‍♀️",BlackOsmosis15,2020-04-29 02:39:50,0,545,30.07,59.42,75.49,1,20.19,12.66,95.23,60.55,24.4,19.82,11.74,1.65,0,6.24,0.18,4.59,4.95,13.39,7.52,5.14,7.71,1.83,15.05,4.4,2.57,2.39,2.75,1.28,5.69,0.92,4.77,0.18,3.3,0.37,17.61,5.5,0.55,4.95,7.16,9.54,2.57,1.83,0.55,0.37,1.28,3.12,0.73,0,0.18,0.55,2.02,0.37,1.1,0.37,0.37,11.01,5.32,0.92,3.3,1.1,1.28,8.62,5.14,0.55,14.5,1.65,5.69,7.16,0.18,0.37,0.92,0,0.18,0.37,0.37,0.18,0,0,0.18,0,11.74,4.59,3.12,0,0,0.37,0,0.73,0,1.65,1.1,0.18
ga7kck,It’s Almost My Abuser’s Birthday,"I want to make a long story short, so here it goes. Growing up as a gay, Latinx boy, it was very difficult for me to find someone I could relate to, someone I could call a role mode that could teach me the ways of what it meant to be a strong queer person of color. When I met my abuser in January of 2017, I was instantly captivated by his charisma and how he carried himself. And although he was white, I knew he was the mentor for me. It wasn’t until December of 2019 where I decided to cut contact with him after dealing with so much emotional and mental abuse from him from the day I met him to the last time I saw him in person. I had been driven to attempt suicide on multiple occasions and although he was my college professor and someone I had been working with closely for those years, I couldn’t bring it to myself to report him or seek help. I didn’t want to talk to him about how I felt because I didn’t want him to feel like he had to change or that he was doing something wrong but obviously he was doing something incredibly wrong and I know deep down, he knew that. I also just didn’t want to get him in trouble because I cared about him and loved him so much. When I eventually tried to talk to him, he didn’t accept any responsibility and was “sorry that I felt that way.” That’s when I decided I needed to stop. But I still miss him like fucking crazy and it’s his birthday this Friday, and I always got him something special for it and wished him a happy birthday because although he hates it when people know his birthday, I feel as though it still meant something special to him and I just want to wish him a happy birthday. I’ve been having so many flashbacks and sleepless nights as the day comes closer, I feel so weak and maybe I shouldn’t but I’m still trying to hold on.

ga80hw,can anyone confirm if this is abuse?,"All that I ask is please don’t comment about how much worse you had it or that I’m being sensitive, I just need a safe place to talk and hopefully receive answers so positive or helpful comments only please!!

So first of all I chose to be a vegetarian for moral reasons when I was around 14. Flash forward to when I was 17 and had a car, a job, and was buying my own vegetarian groceries at that point. Honestly this was the best I’d felt in a while whereas I had been experiencing severe anxiety and depression in my early teens. Anyways, my mother was prescribed antidepressants and decided upon herself (without taking me to a doctor or even asking me personally) that I was also depressed and needed medication. I told her I don’t need or want antidepressants and she would say that depressed people often ignore their symptoms and don’t realize they’re depressed. So she forced me to take her pills and when I told her that they made me dizzy and lethargic, she said I either had to keep taking them or she would make me eat meat against my will. 

Is this considered abuse or do you think she was right to do this?

It wasn't that bad and it only happened one day. He felt bad about choking me. But people say it's abuse but I don't think he's abusive?

gadoz4,(Trigger Warning - Sexual Abuse) Trouble with intimacy,"Hello,

First of all thank you for taking the time to read and share your input.  I'm really unsure on how I'm feeling and where to go from here. I have been with my partner for 7.5 years and we have a wonderful relationship. I was abused growing up a handful of times by the same person and then by someone else at 16. I have never told some I was dating until him and then a few years ago, my friend's spouse came onto me to the point that I had to force him off me.

This was extremely triggering for me and I haven't been quite the same, it turns out that trauma manifested itself into some mental health problems but I got help and am on medication and am feeling great. What brings me here is that I still have trouble being touched and receiving pleasure. Before my friend's spouse, it was much easier for me to ask for what I wanted or even orgasm. Now, we have sex and other things but when it comes to him giving to me - I get so tense and upset.

The other night, we tried to and I ended up feeling so triggered to the point of tears.

I'm unsure where to go from here. Any suggestions would be welcome. A dear coworker of mine told me she tried tap therapy (without knowing my situation) and I thought it sounded very effective so any insight on that would be great.

Hope you're all keeping well and safe in this trying time.

gads5s,My mom sexually abused me middle school *22 year old," 

**So my mom has been sexually abusing me ever since I was in middle school. I don't remember much but I did had a dream about it during that time and I didn't think none of it.But as of now. I had a different dream but waking up out of her bed. I still live with her and he we HAD a good relationship but I can still feel the weirdness from her. She used to whisper in my ear weird stuf""f I get lost in your eyes"" and moan whenever my family aren't around. Until I called her out on it she pretends she doesn't know what I'm talking about.**

***My mom is a widow***\*\*.\*\* And she **drinks** a lot I also look like my father so whenever she see's me she'll randomly stare at me without saying words. She argues everyday about little things or be petty. Last year we all were arguing over nothing and my **brother had enough and said than why did you and \*me\* had sex!?** So I was confused because I never crossed my mind he would say such a thing. But lately I've been having supsisions that my **mom abused** me so much at a young age I'm thinking I'm sleep walking into her room playing out the memory trying to catch her on the act. But of course my **mom denies everything we say**. My brother had the nerve to use it against me.

I have a gaming career and so I play **deep mind games** with my opponent so kinda like chess. Sometimes it's hard to make accurate hard reads when I have that thought lingering around my head if my **abused** me or not. The whole vibe of the house screams something is up. And so now my family is playing a petty **mind game** and messing with my **reality.** They say nothing happen and then my brother would troll me with some hints which kills my soul everyday. I learn to forgive everyday especially how crazy people are now and days. But I would never expect my family would treat me like this. I've always been a healthy kid. Active, made straight A's and B's. Sometimes C's when I get lazy. My siblings were under achievers so I'm not surprised when my parents at the time show some favoritism

**I remember in middle school. The age where I was most sexually active and curious. But one day my mother found porn on her computer. She told me ""so you are a tiddy person huh?"" At that moment I don't remember saying anything. I was so embarrassed that she knew what I looked up. And again I bring it up and she says she don't remember. Few days later she would bring up something embarrassing that happen years ago. ( Yeah my mom is toxic ) I fear that I sneak in her room every night or something. Trying to catch her on the act like I said before. I have been sleeping fine but I overthink this everyday so it has drain me. I wanted to do a lie detector on her but I feel like I would be wasting money if I already know the truth. She's a retired veteran so she thinks everything she does is right because she has money. And to rap this up. I don't want her to destroy the person I original was. A lover not a fighter. She mad me into an ugly person. I cut off all of my friends and listen to her negative thoughts. I was abused by her so much I believed everything she said was true. Even if it was a lie. I just don't want to suffer everyday for the truth so I can move on from my life. I don't like my spirit being tortured for false clarity from my mother.**

Sorry for the grammar. It's just me venting out the **truth.**",InfamousExit1,2020-04-29 10:39:04,0,668,12.4,29.49,85.11,8.1,15.18,13.02,94.16,61.68,24.55,19.16,13.17,0.45,0.45,4.94,0.15,5.39,4.64,11.38,10.18,6.59,8.98,2.84,18.56,4.34,2.1,1.65,0.3,1.95,6.89,2.69,4.19,0.6,2.25,0.45,13.47,2.69,0.3,5.84,0.9,15.42,3.14,1.35,1.95,3.14,3.44,3.74,3.44,0.75,2.1,0.6,2.4,0.9,0.45,0.9,0.15,5.69,2.4,0.75,2.1,0.6,0,6.29,9.88,0.45,14.07,0.9,6.29,6.89,1.35,2.1,1.05,0.3,0.3,0.15,0.45,0,0.3,0.15,0.15,0,21.56,7.04,0.15,0,0,0.3,0.15,0,0.6,3.59,0.3,9.43

plain as that. when she said it to me and told that i had told her that my mind was completely shattered and completely blocked on the spot. i told that that i never told her that and how could i have told her that if it never happened. this continued for 2 weeks that she insists i told her that and i started to doubt my own life and reality. 

she knew how much my father is maybe the most important person in my life. and how i adore him.

after two weeks of that she just casually tells me ""yeah when you told me you got out of your room and shouted at them to stop"". 

that moment i felt a gap in me in the size of the universe. i told her are you talking about the time i told you when i was a little kid i heard my parents shouting at each other and after i couldn't hear it anymore i got out of my room and screamed at the top of my lungs at them to stop? she just simply said ""ah, yes"" she shrugged her shoulders and said ""i remembered you telling me otherwise"".

that's just a glimpse of what me and my mind have been through for almost three years.",im_always,2020-04-29 11:35:20,1,242,12.31,69,73.64,19.59,18.62,11.98,95.45,64.46,31.82,23.14,14.46,0,2.48,5.37,0.83,8.68,3.72,12.4,4.55,7.44,8.26,1.24,16.53,2.48,2.07,2.89,1.24,1.24,2.48,0.83,1.24,0.41,0.41,0,19.42,1.65,0.41,5.37,1.24,8.68,1.65,1.24,1.65,2.07,1.65,1.24,3.72,0,3.31,0.41,2.07,1.24,0.83,0,0,4.96,0.83,0.83,1.24,1.24,1.24,10.33,3.72,0,14.46,0.41,7.02,7.02,0,0,0.83,0,0,0,1.65,0,0,1.24,0.41,0,8.68,4.55,0.41,0,0,0.41,0,0,2.48,0.83,0,0

gaj50i,I just don’t understand myself.,"Hello, I hope you take some time out of your day to read this. (Trigger warning sexual assault) 

So when I was around 13 I was constantly being touched (against my will) by my 15 year old classmate il a échoué deux ans. I’ve been constantly bullied indirectement by guys who’d call me whore online, and say that boys always touch me and it’s my fault I allow them ext.. 

That continued a year and a half maybe. Anyway, so after that experience I got away from the bad people I surrounded myself with, and I began to realize that none of what happened was my fault. 

I’m now 16 and I might have PTSD from it because whenever my boyfriend touched me in places where they used to touch me In (I got harassed in public as well and by a guy that tried to kiss me at the beach last summer so that didn’t help the recovery) is freak out and push away, I kinda gotten a bit used to it as he’s very loving and understanding of my situation. 

However, mon problème is that I can’t seem to delete the texts and anything that linked to those dark two years. I still have the messages of guys that texted me in such bad language and bad intentions, and I still have my messages with the boy that mainly caused all that and constantly touched me. 

Every so often I’d go back to those things and cry about how stupid I was, and how innocent and ugh c’est beaucoup, des emotion I really can’t explain, me any boyfriend discussed this together and he can’t understand why I don’t wanna erase my past. 

I’m so lost like I can’t understand why I can’t let go of it. I’m almost over being overdramatic about someone touching me, but I still always remember what happened and what was told to me, and how he touched me with me being visibly uncomfortable, how he made me touch his junk and didn’t let my hand go. I want to forget about it. 

Much much more has happened in my life but this has been also a burden on me I hope I came to the right place for help.",rimeh-samara12,2020-04-29 15:20:26,0,382,9.55,14.15,95.03,2.55,27.29,13.35,94.5,62.04,23.82,16.49,14.14,0,0.52,1.31,0.52,7.33,3.4,12.04,8.9,9.69,9.69,2.62,17.8,1.31,1.31,3.4,1.31,2.36,6.02,1.57,4.19,0.26,0.79,0.52,9.16,0,1.57,0,3.14,14.4,2.36,3.66,1.05,3.66,1.31,3.14,3.4,0.52,0.26,2.36,1.05,0.26,0.26,0.52,0,7.07,2.88,0.79,1.31,1.05,1.57,6.81,9.69,1.31,13.61,1.31,5.76,6.81,0.52,0.26,0,0,0,0,1.83,0.52,0.26,0,0.52,0.26,13.61,3.93,3.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.71,1.57,0
gaka1c,Is it possible that I can’t remember?,"Im writing here as a last resource because I’ve had these thoughts living in my head for far too long and i don’t have friends nor the courage to discuss this with my therapist. I am a 22 year old female and I think I might have been abused when I was a child.
For as long as I can remember I’ve had depression. I remember feeling hopeless even when I was a child. I’ve also always been really insecure, struggled with body image and, of course, I’ve had (or have) eating disorders. I’ve never had any genuine interests, I struggle to find activities I like or enjoy, I sometimes feel like I’m numb, like I don’t have a personality. Ever since I finished college my life has been in hiatus, I was just existing I guess. I refused to see a psychiatrist but started seeing a therapist 2 years ago and, after many ups and downs, for the past 5/6 months i started to feel happy. I genuinely thought I was “cured”. I decided to go to university and for the first time in my life I thought my life could could be good.
Now here’s the thing, I met someone I like. We started talking a few weeks before the quarantine started in my country so we weren’t able to see each other, yet we speak every single day. Of course sex is something we discuss and some feelings I’ve tried to hide came back. You see, I’ve had sex, but I’ve never felt any pleasure. Not even masturbating. I’ve been to a gynecologist and there’s nothing wrong with me physically. I’ve tried many things but I. Just. Can’t. Feel. A. Thing. Or I feel pain.
I started to think which could be the reason I can’t feel any  pleasure, the reason I get “blocked” while having sex. and this thought that has always been in my head came back. I have this memory of me being in my uncle’s bedroom when I was a child, I can remember he was sitting on a chair by the desk, playing computer games, and I can remember where the bed was (I mean, visually those are the two things I remember) I remember he asked if I wanted to stay the night and I said I did but I needed to go to my house and grab a pijama. And this is the part that has been in my head for so long, after I said that he said “you don’t need to, we’ll sleep together, naked”. 
That’s it. I’ve said it. That’s the memory I’ve been trying to repress. I’ve always doubted whether that happened or not, because I don’t remember any other weird situation ever happening, but at the same time I don’t remember much about my childhood. I’ve always been very afraid to tell anyone because I worry I might have made that memory up. Could it be possible that I made it up? How could I know? Should I tell someone? What if it didn’t happen? This is a very big accusation to make, and I don’t have ANY proof besides that fading memory. 
That’s it. I guess I just needed to tell someone or write this somewhere. Could this be possible ? Could I have been abused and, even if i can’t remember it, it still has an impact on my life?",half_apers0n,2020-04-29 16:24:47,4,574,7.5,7.18,98.5,15.89,13.67,14.63,96.17,62.02,23.69,16.2,14.46,0.87,0.35,0.52,0,7.32,5.05,9.23,15.33,5.57,7.67,3.14,28.57,3.31,1.57,1.39,1.22,2.44,4.18,1.74,2.44,1.22,0.35,0.35,6.27,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.7,20.21,6.27,1.74,2.79,5.23,1.92,4.53,3.48,0.87,0.87,1.74,3.66,1.05,1.74,0.87,0.17,5.23,1.57,0.87,1.92,0.35,0.52,10.45,14.81,0.52,12.2,0.87,4.36,7.49,1.57,0.35,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.69,6.1,4.53,0,0,1.22,0,0,1.05,5.92,0.7,0.17
gakfsz,Need some advise not sure if this is a type of abuse of what,"So I'm 20 and I went on holiday with this guy (23) I dated from uni, my cousin and her boyfriend. 
I ended things ages ago with the guy because I didn't like him like that. I shared a room with him on holiday as I thought might as well as I have before, also my cousin and her bf can be alone. He would try to cuddle me, pull my closer during the night and I kept moving away, there I was thinking he got the message. We all went on a night out, I just wanted to look nice, feel good and have a good night. At the club he kept trying to dance with me, I kept moving away. By the end of the night I remember nothing. Next thing I remember is it's morning, I got nothing on but a t-shirt and his hand is moving up my leg into my vagina. Then I realised and told him to stop. Anything could of happened that night, and I would never know because I can't remember. Was I being naive thinking it was ok to share a room? Happy to give any other details for some light on this.

gaql6k,"I’m reporting my father, but I don’t know how","My father definitely has some issues, maybe bipolar disorder. But sometimes, the way he acts definitely does not excuse it. My grandmother is hospital and no one is taking her in, and my father on the other side of the world is obviously distressed. Understandably, he's really on edge and he’s a mess.

But my mother is occupied making something and she accidentally burned something my father cooked last night. He made this huge drama about it for an HOUR. An hour straight of yelling and cursing! Telling her that she is lazy when she looks after a disabled child and maintains his feeding times while being a teacher. This hasn’t happened in a long time but isn’t the first. He’s done this over literally anything. I understand he is angry but his emotional state is not normal and he needs help. He came into my room last night for apologising and I don’t think it was sincere. Maybe I’m still too angry? I wasn’t going to report it until my mother mentioned to him that she felt abused. I don’t know if she’s going to do anything about it but I don’t really care about “keeping our family’s good reputation” afloat. I tried to tell her that there’s nothing wrong with reporting it but she’s too nice. 

I’m a school student, so should I contact my guidance teacher? Or someone else? Isolation isn’t really helpful so I have no clue who to contact. Should I report him? I’m not sure if this is normal in every household and maybe I could be overreacting. But yesterday, he made her cry. He didn’t lay a hand on her but things were said and he did apologise but I’m scared he’ll start again in front of my younger brother.

gaqwqh,Hi! I don't know what to do.,"Hi guys! I'm in college, and I live in a house with multiple people, like 30ish. It's always been a lovely place to live! For the past two years, there has been a guy in the house who is a little bit older than everyone else, like he's not in college. I'm gonna tell you some of the things he did to me (he also was pretty creepy to others). The point is my house had a ""hearing"" where people aired their problems with him and eventually he got kicked out. However, I can't stop thinking about it and being angry and I don't know what to do. It wasn't bad enough that I could ever do anything legal about it, but it is just bad enough to torment me so...here ya go. And then I also explain this other situation that I also can't stop being angry about, even though I hate being angry and prefer to love/forgive everyone. Sorry it's so long! Also, I wrote this before this post, which is why I re-explain the whole scenario. 

 

At the house where I live, there’s a guy who has been there a looonnng time. And unbeknownst to me has had issues respecting people’s boundaries in the past, but no one said anything because he “changed” or whatever. Well after I went through a breakup, he took advantage of me so many times when I was emotionally fragile. There were times when I had to physically pry myself away from him hugging me. He would just kiss me ON THE LIPS randomly and disgustingly in weird situations and I couldn’t scream or anything because it would cause a scene. I finally told him to leave me alone and I told him that he’s a good person deep down but needs to stop his behavior. And then he started freakin' crying and was like “you lead me on” but I really didn’t. At all. We didn’t really talk for a while but one day I just smiled and made small talk and for some reason that gave him the a-ok to start doing all that stuff again. One time we had a house party and he was kind of tipsy and started rubbing my leg and moving upward and the guy next to me who was my friend started to yell at him and the house presidents brought them both into the kitchen. The guy who I’ve been talking about starts crying and throwing a temper tantrum on the floor even though he’s fricking 28, and talks about how he’s been through so much in his life because he said he had been sexually abused and said that none of us have known hardship, so I felt so bad for everyone else in the room who have been through so many things but then I also felt bad for him because maybe his history of being abused is why he did what he did. Anyway, he apologized to us all later and the presidents decided to give him another chance. Then this year he didn’t do much romantic to me but when I would sit down to study, he would sit so close to me our legs would touch even though I wanted to study alone and if I said anything like “omg I’m confused” he would say stuff like “awwww, abby” and rub my back. And I couldn’t get any studying done IN MY OWN HOUSE BECAUSE HE WOULD SEEK ME OUT. Then I found out he was doing similar things to a girl whom he had had consensual sex with but he like would obsess over her and turn up at her house randomly so at this point I reported him again and other people raised concerns. We had a whole hearing and he got expelled from the house. But I feel seriously messed up from it now, like even when my friends touch me in a comforting way I feel the need to get away, even when my parents touch me, and especially when guys who I’m going out on a date with touch me. 

There was also a guy who was in my ecology discussion and we just talked for like two minutes the first class. Then it turned out he was also in my microbiology lab so when I saw him there I waved because I recognized him. Then we sort of bonded as friends because he had good taste in music. But then he started saying super weird stuff about me like mostly complimentary but still weird in that setting. And one time he even said “you owe me a kiss” or something and wouldn’t drop it. He would also yank my hair all the time in lab which I know little kids do but it was so aggravating. Then he started getting super creepy and in lab, he legit pointed at this girl across from me and said “hey Abby, I think that girl’s cuter than you” to like mock me which is so offensive to everyone involved and he said it like OUT LOUD, like she heard and it was so freaking uncomfortable. He was also the kind of person who would say “hahahah your face is so red” super loud just to embarrass you. Anyway, then he started calling me all of my least favorite names for women in class under his breath like it was supposed to be funny. Also, he tried to cheat off me a billion times. Then one time in lecture he grabbed my arm and squeezed it so hard, I thought it would actually break and it hurt for days after and I couldn’t even pull away. Then he stabbed me in the leg with a mechanical pencil and broke my skin and it bled, and then after class was done for the semester he messaged me on facebook saying that he wanted to go out with me, I didn’t answer, and he trash talked me all over his public facebook page. And I don’t care about what those people think, but it’s just so terrible and it’s making me question my normal niceness because my being nice to these people is why they thought they could be so mean to me, like I’m too scared to not be nice just because I usually am nice. I DID report this guy to the teacher, by the way, so she moved his seat away from me in lab, but he just found his way back.

I KNOW it's not my fault for being nice, but being nice triggered all of these things. If I had just been unfriendly to either of these people, they wouldn't have latched on like they did. So it really bothers me because I know that these people are still out there, making poor people stop being nice. Nice people are the reason why life is worth living, and if these creeps cause others pain, I am going to blame myself, even if I reported them to people. But NOTHING happened except a seat being moved and the first guy getting banned from the house. So I don't know what to do.",TheSpinyFlea,2020-04-30 00:07:25,1,1206,12.13,56.59,49.3,15.31,24.12,12.02,95.52,64.51,22.31,15.34,8.21,0.66,0.58,5.31,0.58,6.97,4.23,12.69,10.12,8.54,11.44,1.82,18.82,3.73,2.24,2.65,0.91,1.91,6.72,2.99,3.73,0.41,1.24,0.58,14.84,0.08,1.08,0.66,5.72,13.43,2.4,2.16,2.32,2.32,1.24,4.23,3.23,0.17,1.58,1.41,1.74,0.66,0.66,0.17,0.17,5.56,2.07,0.75,1.24,0.83,0.83,7.63,7.71,1.41,13.68,1.49,6.22,5.97,1.66,0.33,1,0.25,0,0,1,0.17,0.41,0.08,0.08,0.17,12.35,4.06,3.32,0,0,0,0.33,0.17,1.33,2.9,0.17,0.08
garhc2,How to plan moving out of abusive home safely? Please tell me your experiences!!,"\[Australia\]

I am turning 16 and in high school. I have no life skills \[I am not overly sheltered, more neglected but I am always berated for not being able to do anything despite asking abuser\[parent\] that I want to learn. and am always demanded to do things.\] I have no idea how to approach this wish but I do want to move out eventually. 

How do I plan this without going homeless / minimal backlash? I want to suddenly cut contact with abuser \[parent\] in the future without them knowing my location but I don't know how you can do that?? Do you have to tell the government that you're moving out ? how? Like I don't even know how to cook or make a doctors appointment let alone buying a small apartment and paying for university on my own etc.

I also want to plan what I can do right NOW. I am 60% sure I can convince abuser that I should get a job. I really want to start saving up cause it seems important. I don't know how to write a good resume but I have gotten started on that at least. I also know NOTHING about banks etc. I think I got my own debit card when I was 15.but my abuser has it and I don't know how debit cards work or what they are. Abuser has a bank account made for me since I was little that has money in it. I want to know how to get access to these \[and how old I have to be\] when I'm older without asking abuser directly as I want to just discreetly disappear.  Also I don't know how how to get important things like passports I guess.

oh also I convinced abuser for me to start getting my drivers license this year though corona has messed that up.   umm I'm exhausted from getting beat up five minutes ago and now I have a huge cut i'm trying to deal with. I  can't think of anything else right now but hopefully you get the gist of what i'm trying to ask.

I can learn cooking and cleaning and stuff online myself, and am getting started on that. and I know how to discreetly pack everything so I can PHYSICALLY move out but it's the legal / technical? stuff i'm struggling with.

thanks for reading sorry for weird wording but I really need any help from y'all",waitingforlifeafter,2020-04-30 00:57:30,4,424,14.74,7.19,92.67,5.57,16.31,13.44,93.16,59.2,20.05,13.92,12.03,0,1.42,0,0.47,6.13,2.36,13.92,11.08,7.55,9.91,3.3,23.11,2.12,1.42,4.25,0.94,0.71,5.66,1.89,3.77,0.24,1.89,0.71,4.25,0.47,0.24,0,0,18.4,4.01,4.01,2.59,2.36,1.42,4.95,0.47,0.24,0,0,1.42,0,0.94,0,0.47,8.96,0.71,2.12,3.54,2.83,0.24,1.89,19.81,1.89,11.32,1.42,5.19,4.72,3.54,0.71,0.47,2.12,0,0,0.47,0,0,0,0.47,0,16.04,4.72,0.47,0,0,1.65,0.47,0,0,3.3,0,5.42
gatf16,Was this a toxic friendship?,"This is gonna be long and english isn't my first language so I'm sorry about that!

So I (F16) was friends with this girl(F16), I'll call her B, our friendship basically started since we were the only people of our own age at this place where we would get tutored and could get help with schoolwork. When we first met we were both 13.
The other girls where like, 16/18 years old and they would constantly tell us to shut up, basically bully us, ignore us and act like they had any kind of authority over us since we were younger. The adults that supervised and helped us just saw it as teasing and joking around but this basically caused me and B to become friends as we were both the only people that took the other seriously and actually want to talk and sit together etc. 

We didn't have much in common but we didn't want to be alone so we tolerated each other. She is very close minded and very traditionally thinking, she wants to have a husband and kids and be a stay at home mom which I have no problem with, everyone can do whatever they want if they're happy and not hurting anyone but she doesn't understand or like my want to have a career and my aversion for marriage. We've had a couple of arguments as she always found ways of making my opinions sounds ridiculous and stupid and would angrily tell me to shut up when I didn't agree with her. 

I'm someone who constantly jumps from interest to interest. Like I'll obsess over one topic for a while, constantly am busy with that, literally only want to be busy with that to the point of not being able to research it bc I'm busy with something else kinda upsets me and I constantly procrastinate on homework etc bc of that. It doesn't affect my schoolwork that much tho bc I'm fast in understanding stuff and I'm good at doing assignments in the last minute. But like, the longest fixation I had was for a year, and it had been on kpop. Not proud of that, but it kept me busy as there's always something new in the industry, and she used to make fun of me for that. Every time I had a new thing to fixate on, she would either make excessive fun of it or just dismissively listen to me while making it obvious she didn't care. So I stopped talking about the things I was interested in and instead just listened whenever she said something and would just get along with it since that was easier. 

And for a while that helped! I felt like our friendship was getting better and for a while I felt genuinely happy about it. 

But Like basically one day ( one year ago, so we were 15) we were just playing with this piece of ribbon, I was wrapping one end around my finger as she did that with the other end. And some girl just mentioned we looked like we were getting engaged (idk if that's a thing around the world but like in my country you wear rings and there is a ribbon that connects both and to make the engagement official you cut the ribbon) anyway, we thought it was funny so we cut the ribbon and acted like we actually were engaged. It became an inside joke. 

But after a while she would constantly mention it, and even ""jokingly"" act possessive, telling me I wasn't allowed to get to friendly with people she didn't know as well and how I couldn't make new friends etc. Every time I was talking with someone else she would say I was cheating on her and drag me away. The first couple of times I thought it was funny but after almost 4 months of this it kinda started to make me uncomfortable. She is openly homophobic tho so I didn't know how to talk to her about it without her being ""grossed out"" or something bc me talking about it would mean it wasn't a joke anymore. 

While that happened there also was a new girl that was our age. B already knew her so our duo became a trio. But whenever I tried to get to know the girl or when we would get along B would try to stop that? Like she would constantly get into arguments with the other girl, I'll call her H. Like B would constantly mention how SHE was my best friend, and how SHE knew me longer and therefore H should back off etc. But whenever I wouldn't be around or whenever B and I had an argument, H and B would get along really well. In fact since they were my only friends there whenever B and I fought she would drag H everywhere and I would be alone as I have really bad social anxiety and couldn't handle conversation with people I wasn't already familiar and friendly with. 

After a while I started being extremely uncomfortable with Bs behaviour. I told her I would like her to stop the whole engagement thing but she didn't listen and continued for a whole month before she finally stopped after we had yet another talk about how it made me uncomfortable. Instead she started demanding my attention constantly. In the group chat B, H and I had she would constantly send selfies and tag me and basically demand compliments. I always had to be available to text her and she didn't stop until I told her she was beautiful etc even tho I told her that I wasn't that comfortable with her constantly wanting that kind of attention from me. 

Whenever we would have an argument she would just blame me and leave the group chat or block me and that act like nothing happened the next day. Whenever I wanted to talk about it bc I wanted to resolve our arguments she would just ignore me. Which caused the problems we had to never really go away so we would argue more often. Look I really cared about her, even tho I wasn't like, in love with her, I really did love her a lot platonically. And like her dismissing me like that hurt my feelings but whenever I mentioned it she would act like I'm the weird one for doing that. 

After a while I put some distance between us, after I realised that I was so emotionally tired and basically kinda depressed about this. It didn't last long as she constantly tried to get close to me again. Even the supervisors would comment on how good friends we were and how they couldn't understand why I was acting that way since I was the only person to tolerate and be able to handle Bs difficult personality as she did listen to me sometimes, and I might have said some pretty harsh things to B when she wouldn't leave me alone. So after that I felt guilty and we were kinda close again. 

It was the end of the year tho so when I mentioned how my niece was gonna join the place we went to she ""jokingly"" said I wasn't allowed to spend much time with my niece as B didn't want me to be friends with someone she didn't already know. 

This year tho, my niece did join us and I started sticking with her. After that two other new girls joined us and me my niece and another girl became really close and I kinda stopped talking with B after we got into arguments about that and she started to constantly talk with me passive aggressively, constantly try to start arguments etc. 

She also treats my niece and the other girl pretty badly, and even started a rumour about my niece a while ago. She even told a teacher at school about it made it sound as if she was being bullied by my friends and that I was the one pushing my friends to do that.

Now things have kinda calmed down as she tolerates them and I have stopped ignoring her and we're on hesitant speaking terms. 

I did end the friendship tho but I do feel occasional guilt about not being her friend anymore. Sometimes I also felt like she was obsessive and maybe even in love with me but I always felt stupid for thinking that as she's really homophobic and idk? She probably isn't a lesbian.

Was this a toxic friendship? Or am I overreacting? I honestly don't know as whenever I try to talk to someone else about it they would just get uncomfortable as it is a bit of a weird topic. 

Anyway, if you read this thanks I guess since this is really long. I needed to get this of my chest as this has been bothering me for a while.",Bendebilmiomartik,2020-04-30 03:49:33,0,1502,10.97,59.47,52.03,15.47,25.03,14.91,94.74,65.11,21.97,15.11,7.79,2.73,0.2,3.93,0.47,6.86,4.19,13.38,10.59,9.65,11.05,2.46,19.71,4.53,3.46,1.93,1,1.73,6.19,2.66,3.4,0.8,1.13,0.47,14.71,0.6,0.8,5.06,0.07,15.58,2.06,2.4,3.2,3.2,0.87,4.86,1.86,0.33,0.8,0.73,0.67,0.2,0.2,0.07,0,8.99,4.79,1.07,1.33,1.26,0.87,8.52,7.66,0.47,13.72,0.87,4.26,8.72,1.2,0.6,0.13,0.07,0,0,2.8,0.13,2.46,0.07,0.13,0.27,9.92,3.53,2.13,0,0,0.33,0.13,0,0.4,2.8,0.53,0.07
gau2wy,My brother threatens to hit me over stupid things. Is that abuse?,"So I'm staying with my family and I'm the youngest child. I have an older brother who is a complete slob. Seriously, no job and he spends the whole day in his room playing video games. He's been doing this for years. Obviously he needs help, but he doesn't want it.

My brother threatens to hit me when I don't ""listen to him.""

A few examples:

1. Happened a few years ago but I can't forget. He asked me to look online regarding the new iPhone. I told him the online store didn't have the details whether they had it in stock, he told to me keep checking. So I did, and I told him again there's no details and he's like did you check properly? And started getting annoyed. I said yes I did and he told me to check some more. Obviously I got annoyed and I said there isn't any details! And he immediately said ""what's wrong with you? Do you need to be disciplined? You want to get slapped is it?"" I started crying.. cause I was scared.. and my mum told me angrily to go to sleep.. 

2. I forget the context, but I remembered he threaten to hit me and all I did was ran into my room and locked the door. He started banging on the door, almost trying to break it and told me to get out.

3. The most common thing he does is to scare me through threats (""do you want to get slapped? Do you want to get hit?""). I can't say no because I know he will threaten to hit me. Chores, of course everyone in the house has to do them, right? But I don't know if my mum's scared.. but my brother never does the chores.. and apparently he can boss me around when it comes to the chores.. 

Is this abuse? Even though he hasn't laid a finger on me.. 

However, he has some history. A few years ago I had a nanny at home. One day they argued, and the next thing I knew, he hit her and she was unconscious.

Me and my sister wanted to call the ambulance. But my mum said no. My nanny eventually woke up and they somewhat ""apologized"" to each other.

I can understand why mum didn't want to call the police/ambulance. But it really hurts.. that she lets him hurt me mentally. I've told her before that I find it unfair but she doesn't do anything about it.

gauonc,"Three toxic men, four animals, and one pig. Hi my names Ryan and my life is kinda fukked (rn)","So my family and I recently moved to Washington around 2018 (September) I was long distant with my boyfriend in Texas and we were all extremely excited to go back to Washington. Our home base, most of my family are here as well so it felt right. When we got here there was no support from either sides of my parents family, our presence brought immediate drama. It caused a lot of problems for us because this wasn’t the best welcome, we all slowly drifted apart, picking at each other and constantly screaming and fighting. I ended up changing schools mid year of my senior year, barely graduated with a really bad addiction to cigarettes. No one but my uncle and grandma on my dads side showed up to my graduation (my dads Samoan, if you know Samoan culture you know we travel in herds so this was really upsetting) my uncle who abused my siblings and I, who even attributed to my parents divorce never showed up, he fucked my mom for seven years the least I deserved was to have the fuck watch me graduate.. after graduation my parents divorced and my mom left me with our dog and took my two youngest brothers with her back to Texas to be with my dads other brother (she has some priority problems with men and children she gets them confused) My boyfriend came up to Washington from Texas which was horrible Timing. Since my moms been gone it’s just been my brother, boyfriend and dad. My dad is never home because he drives trucks around the country, which leaves me with my sociopath brother with severe drug addiction who hasn’t even managed to get past or even through sophomore year, he’s extremely verbally abusive and he gets physically abusive especially on the drugs and alcohol, he steals from everyone but stole at least $250 since graduation of 2019. My boyfriend is constantly on his computer, our relationship has really given me some bad insecurities from him looking at porn, drawings, and other woman excessively he tries to work on it but it’s a fail I guess and i thought it stopped but here we are, he’s constantly angry and has hit my dog before I’ve gotten in physical fights, he doesn’t ever really do anything with me anymore but sit in the room on the computer and I never know what to do because he could be doing a number of things but he’ll never admit to them, and then there’s dad. He’s abusive asf, lies about anything negative about him, he constantly talks about my mom and where she might be, had basically tried replacing my mom with me as far as caretaker goes. He says I’m using him for money even though he hasn’t given me money for groceries since early last December and even when he has it was never enough for groceries. If anything’s wrong with the house it’s most likely my fault and when I told him just recently of a new drug my brother was on and how bad the withdrawals were he blamed it on me.. Everyone comes to me for their troubles in my family but I don’t think I have it in me anymore to do this. We have four animals and I can barley manage brushing my teeth in the morning but I make it a habit to take care of them, they need more and with two young men in the house you’d think I get that but I don’t and I won’t but I don’t know if my heart could handle getting rid of any of the pets. Dallas, my dog has severe separation anxiety, toa my other dog is scared of the guys and is extremely roudy (I nursed her back to health so she’s obviously my baby) then we have the hamster (?that guys wierd lol) and our cat my brother brought home last week..  she’s extremely friendly and very fat idk what to do anymore but if I don’t get advice maybe at least I’ll have the small pleasure of knowing someone knows a small fraction of what I feel or go through.. and then me the “pig bitch” by far my favorite nickname, I cried for a while hearing it but it’s fine, I think it suits me and my amAzing life.",dkdkjdif,2020-04-30 05:25:15,4,748,18.39,47.86,80.08,2,37.4,16.71,93.45,58.96,22.06,16.71,10.29,1.74,0.4,3.61,0.67,5.35,3.21,12.57,8.56,7.22,9.09,2.41,16.71,4.55,2.14,1.74,1.47,1.87,5.88,1.47,4.28,0.8,1.6,0.27,14.97,4.14,0.94,1.87,5.88,12.83,1.74,1.74,1.2,2.94,2.14,4.41,1.34,0.53,0.4,0.4,2.94,0.4,2.01,0.4,0.67,9.89,4.68,0.67,1.87,1.87,1.34,4.81,10.43,0.94,14.44,2.14,6.02,6.82,1.87,0.94,1.47,0.27,0,0,1.07,0.53,0.53,0,0.13,0.13,12.3,3.07,3.74,0,0,0.13,0,0,0.27,3.34,1.6,0.13

Anyone have any past experiences of this? I recently talked to my sister about touched her crotch and trying to kiss her when was sleeping next to her one night, At the time she woke up, I was shook,  and she said u can try to kiss me again, I did but we we both weirded out and knew I knew it was wrong, I was 11 and she was 10, I think a little earlier in our childhood, we kissed each other, once or twice, not really knowing what we were doing, and I remember trying to bribe her for sexual play when we were about 9 which I feel bad about but she never said yes, thankfully. most of the people I’ve talked to about this, say that this is not abuse and I was too young, so I shouldn’t beat myself up, but wanted an honest opinion.

gaymqu,Help with Anxiety in Relationship,"I hope this is the right place to talk about this... Because of what happened in my boyfriend's life I was redirected here.  My boyfriend (19) and I (F18) have been dating for a couple of months, we've known each other for almost 2 years.  We started off as good friends before pursuing a romantic relationship.  To give some background, we both come from very religious backgrounds and have just recently started to break away from those beliefs.  He was molested by a guy in high school when he was a kid. He never got the proper help for that.

Just recently, i had an important talk with him that had to be over the phone because of quarantine.  I asked him if he had any previous sexual activity with someone else before me because I felt I needed to know that to feel safe moving forward in the relationship regarding sex.  We have only had oral sex, touching each other, making out, that sort of things.  (I asked him before any of that if he had done this with any other girl before, he said no).

however, I knew he had done something to get himself excommunicated from the church... I just needed to  make sure it wasn't any sexual activity.  He finally agreed to tell me.  This is something he hadn't told anybody except the clergy at church.  He said he wasn't lying when he told me he'd never done anything with another girl.  Emphasis on girl.  He said he did some stuff with a boy he knew from elementary school when he was 16 until he was 17.

This of course worried me... I'm working on not being so insecure and hearing this made me question if he was an in-the closet gay and maybe he wasn't attracted to me.  So I asked him if he felt attracted to guys.  He told me that he didn't.  That after each encounter he had with this boy, he felt empty.  He said he even started watching different porn (I assume gay porn) to see if that would get him off or not....and that it did nothing to him.  He said he realized the reason he did things with the other guy was because he felt really alone and that boy was the only one giving him that kind of attention.  He said for a while he'd look at guys to try and see if he was attracted to them or not and that he wasn't...that he couldn't feel attracted to them in that way.

I asked him if it felt any different when me and him did things than when him and the guy did. He told me that they can't even be compared.  That when he did things with me he was happy and it felt right.  He knows how anxious I am of being abandoned and reassured me that he loves me and wants me.

Everything he told me makes sense. And I want to believe him. When we weren't together he'd even follow those social media accounts of girls showing off their huge breasts and butts (and that made me feel insecure as well because I don't look like them) and he's had other girlfriends before me.  But it worries me that he's lying to himself because he's so ashamed of it.  He told me it was embarrassing and he never wanted to talk about this with anyone except maybe his therapist when he finds one.

I have been encouraging him to go to therapy for his past abuse and other issues and he agrees he agrees he should but it has just been tricky with the pandemic going on. I just don't want to be hurtful to him but I also feel very anxious about being abandoned in the future. Does anyone have any advice on how to go about this? How to feel more confident that he's telling the truth? Or does it seem like he's not being honest with himself? I really need an objective point of view on this. Thank you to anyone who reads all of this.",WorldlySignificance6,2020-04-30 09:12:01,0,693,11.64,77.78,7.62,35.87,16.12,13.28,96.83,65.95,27.27,17.89,5.92,0.72,0.14,10.39,0.72,9.38,3.32,14.14,10.25,6.2,8.51,2.89,21.21,3.9,2.45,1.88,0.87,2.31,6.06,3.32,2.74,1.3,0.58,0.72,21.36,0,1.3,0.58,11.83,17.6,3.9,2.16,2.6,5.19,1.3,5.63,4.18,1.01,1.15,1.88,2.02,0.29,0.43,1.3,0,5.63,3.17,0.58,1.59,0.72,0.14,11.69,8.37,0.58,9.96,1.01,4.47,4.62,0.72,0,0.14,0.14,0.72,0,0.29,0.14,0,0,0.14,0,14,7.5,1.3,0,0,0.43,0,0.14,0,3.17,1.44,0

gb2byv,Where do I draw the line between mental illness and signs abuse?,"Okay so I’ve been sitting with these thoughts for weeks now and I feel like quarantine has only given me more time to think about them and I don’t really have friends so I figured I’d give it a shot here. I don’t even know if this will be seen or just get lost in the sea of posts but what the heck, worth a shot. Here goes:

For some needed context, I (21F) have had three serious relationships in my young adult life. My first was with A (18M) when I was 17. It lasted 8 months “long” distance (about an hour away at college). He was very manipulative and a pathological liar- for example, he had his ex (who still had feelings for him) come and visit him at college and didn’t tell me for months. When I got upset over it, he twisted it into me feeling bad for getting mad at him. Now don’t get me wrong I’m not controlling over who anyone is friends with, just don’t lie to me about it and cover it up. 

My second relationship was with C (20M) when I was 18. We were together for a year and a half and almost moved in together. Through rose colored glasses, I felt like he was my soulmate. I thought I was lucky enough to meet the LOML at 18. After like 2-3ish months of dating the honeymoon phase wore off. He as a child experienced some SPD/spectrum symptoms which I recognized because both of my little sisters (2/5) are on the spectrum. He went through therapy as a kid and turned out mostly fine other than his anger. He would get MAD. Punching drywall, breaking computers and game controllers, screams until he cries mad. To make a long story short, he hit my 5yo sister when she was having a meltdown. He punched me in the thigh when I was trying to get his attention from a video game. He yelled at me and put me down for being chronically ill (endometriosis and depression). I couldn’t take it anymore and instead of getting in another fight with him, I cheated. I immediately came clean and that was that. 

Okay so keep that in mind with you; I was in one emotionally abusive relationship and one physically AND emotionally abusive relationship before meeting J. 

J(19M) and I (21F) started dating in November of 2019. I was admittedly in the middle of a depressive episode and I wanted to feel loved. He was nice company, we got along well, my (former) roommate liked him, we both had experience with depression and he connected with me in a way C never could. 

So from here I’ll dive into the pros and cons. 

Pro: We have incredibly similar personalities and we enjoy the same TV shows, movies, activities, dates, etc.

Pro: He spends a lot of time with me and prioritizes me often. 

Pro: He’s smart and we share the same level of understanding on most subjects. 

Pro: The sex is AMAZING

Pro: His family loves and adores me and accepts me as their own. In fact I’m living with them now (see cons). 

Pro: He pays for 90% of everything and always makes me feel loved and spoiled. I offer to pay constantly and he refuses. 

Pro: He takes care of me on my bad health days. 

Pro: I really do feel a deep connection with him. And he’s very committed to me and has mentioned marriage multiple times. 

So now comes the cons. 

Con: He is an incredibly good liar. After the first time we had sex, I casually asked about his body count. He told me it was 6 and we moved on. Later days we would joke and exchange funny or exciting sex stories. Two weeks later I addressed that ~I wasn’t having as good as a time as he was in bed~. He finally broke down and said the reason why is because he had been lying for the past two weeks, he was a virgin. The lie itself is understandable, I get it’s a masculinity thing whatever. It’s how well and detail he told it. 

Con: He gets insanely jealous and possessive when it comes to my ex C. C and I went through a long grueling break up, mostly because he was my boss the summer after we broke up at a water park. He was in my life for 2 years and then he wasn’t. I often mentioned stories about him and J would get really upset that I had more stories with C than with him. One night J drunkenly called C while I was driving and asked him about his sex life with me and about the time he hit my sister, it was mortifying. The next day was thanksgiving and C went over to my grandmas house while I was at J’s and dropped off every memory of our relationship and texted my parents saying he was done with me and wanted me out of his life. I felt so guilty, so I went over to C’s house (which funny enough was in the same neighborhood as J) and tried desperately to apologize, he refused to talk to me. Fast forward to a couple of weeks and C finally contacts me and is ready to talk over lunch. We talked for about 9 hours just catching up and having our first civilized conversation since the cheating. It felt nice to have my friend back ***** I no longer have romantic feelings for C ***** admittedly it was a long talk and I’ll take 100% blame for that. J was just about on the edge of suicidal when I came home and told him C and I had made amends. C and I would then hold the occasional text conversation which I later learned were read behind my back by J. Fast forward to New Years, J got insanely drunk and had a complete breakdown after midnight because he was so upset that I even talked to C (and btw I was always honest about it with J). C and I met up again in February and J finally let it go and accepts our friendship except that I can’t ever hang out with C. 

Con: He is depressed and he self diagnosed himself with DID (for the record I hate self diagnoses and don’t believe he has it). There’s a lot to unpack here so I’ll do my best to sum up. 
-He got in a fight with his dad and got so depressed he put an empty gun to his head and pulled the trigger
-I tried to kill myself via opioid overdose due to an unrelated issue, he pulled a “Romeo” and fought the bottle out of my hand and took them himself. We understandably spent the night in the ER and he was fine. 
-He attempted a Tylenol overdose after a fight over him going to therapy and me not. 4 days in hospital, again he’s okay. 
-I started self harming and he told my mom that he was worried about me. I don’t really talk to my mom at all let alone about my depression so I was upset for him going behind my back. His solution to this was getting his gun out again only this time his parents put a lock on it. Then there was a 30 minute physical fight between me and him wrestling with wire cutters and a gun case. His dad came home and de-escalated the situation, I don’t know what would’ve happened if he came home later. 
-He gets frequent “lows” when we have stupid little fights over anything that a normal couple would fight over. When he hits these lows, he tries to break up with me or get me to leave him and not because he doesn’t want me- but because he doesn’t want himself. He has said word for word “just leave me so it’ll be easier when I do it (suicide).” 
-He refuses to go to therapy or get on meds because he has wanted to join the navy his whole life and “he’ll get blacklisted if he admits to his depression” and he’s already been separated once because of depression. 

Con: Coercion sex. One night when he was drunk and I was tired he got on top of me and had a look in his eyes. Nothing happened but I never forgot. After we get in big fights he uses sex as a coping mechanism and admittedly I do to. I’d say 9/10 make up sex sessions are fine. But there’s the 1/10 that I say yes to, only because I’m afraid he’ll get low if I say no. I’m not sure what to make of it at the moment. 

Con: He talks to my former roommate M (22F) behind my back. My roommate and I got in a huge fight two weeks after we moved apartments. That’s a whole other story but it escalated when I had a suicide attempt after New Years and J and I called out of work that day. J posted a picture of us eating s’mores on social media and M saw. Side note- we all worked together including M’s bf at a restaurant. M was pissed and J responded to her by saying that it was because of a suicide attempt caused by M fighting with me. J said that with his own words and thoughts, not me. That was the last straw for M and she sent my a huge and hurtful paragraph essentially kicking me out. The things she said to me were some of the meanest things I’ve ever been told. Yet J maintains a good relationship with M and doesn’t really care about how she hurt me. 

Now I started off by explaining my previous relationships for a reason. I vent to my best friend often about all this and he tells me I should just leave. Only it’s not that easy because I can’t tell what’s abuse vs. symptoms of a mental illness. I also don’t want to be the girl who’s always the victim and “claiming” all my exes were abusive. It just doesn’t sit right with me. 

Also I live with him. I have nowhere else to go that easy. My mom lives in a two bedroom condo with my two autistic sisters and it’s already very crowded. My grandma is in poor health and I don’t want to expose her to covid19 and we’ve always had a questionable relationship. And that’s the only close family I have. 

So to sum up, there’s some heavy stuff in the cons but also I know I’m not perfect either and a lot of my negative side I feel comes from my depression so I try really hard to use that to explain it for J. Explain, not excuse. It’s been almost six months now and I really do love him and I’m living with him and his parents so it’s all very murky to me. Any words of wisdom? Do I really need to leave or is this something we can work through? How do I leave him and know that I’m leaving him in good condition and he won’t kill himself? Where do I move to? Is quarantine just messing with my head?

TL;DR- My (21F) bf (19M) is showing signs of abuse but he also has some pretty serious depression and it’s gotten me in a sticky situation.",nysidam26,2020-04-30 12:23:33,0,1944,32.61,60.76,50.6,10.27,17.36,13.53,89.15,57.82,19.75,15.48,8.44,1.13,0.05,5.66,0.21,4.27,4.73,13.37,8.59,6.33,8.9,1.8,18,4.42,2.21,1.49,1.85,1.39,6.02,2.37,3.6,0.41,1.75,0.98,14.25,0.93,0.62,0.82,5.71,9.26,2.11,1.59,1.13,1.75,1.13,2.37,2.06,0.51,0.57,0.82,2.88,0.41,1.49,0.41,0.36,8.49,3.7,0.98,2.01,1.9,0.15,7.25,9,0.67,14.97,2.21,6.53,6.64,0.72,0.62,0.77,0.36,0,0.31,0.72,0.1,0.15,0.21,0.15,0,15.48,5.5,1.7,0.72,0.1,0.31,0,0.62,0.62,3.14,1.85,0.93
gb37ht,Saddest moment of my life,"I ended up pregnant last year with my ex abusers baby, he ended up assaulting me and the baby died. After that he blamed me for her stillbirth and said I did it on purpose and told everyone that I killed her. I did not and would never and this has been very hard as I had given birth to her and had to say my goodbyes alone, he was not there for it at all. 
I feel mostly like the assault is what caused her brain death and I hate him for it. But I hate him more for blaming me for her passing. I cried and was so sad when they told me she passed. I went through it all by myself. Planning her registry with death certificate, planning her burial. It was the most difficult experience, and for him to go around saying I killed her myself and I didn't. My heart is broken, I loved her before she was even here. I will never forgive him for this pain. The nurses could see how sad I was, I cried so much during the entire thing. But he acted as though I was this horrific murderer when I'm positive being shoved into a kitchen table and punched in the ribs was what caused it. I never want to hear from him or see him again.",beanmoon86,2020-04-30 13:09:12,11,233,8.31,41.52,28.53,1,15.53,10.3,97,66.09,28.33,21.89,12.45,0,0,9.01,0.43,6.44,3,12.88,9.01,6.87,9.44,2.58,18.88,6.01,3.43,2.15,0,2.58,9.01,1.29,7.73,0,4.29,2.58,15.88,1.29,0,4.72,4.29,11.16,0.86,1.72,1.29,1.29,3.43,3,4.29,0.86,1.72,1.29,3.86,1.29,1.72,0.43,0.43,4.29,0.43,1.29,1.72,0.43,0.43,10.73,5.58,1.29,11.59,2.15,3,6.44,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,3,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,9.44,6.01,2.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.86,0,0
gb4bha,I am leaving my abusive home tomorrow...but i dont know if i can escape the abuse,"So tomorrow I am headed up to my own apartment that is a few hours away in my university city. I came back home early from school to be quarantined with my parents because ever since I was little I have felt immense guilt about leaving my dad. 

History of my dad and I's relationship:

Ever since I can remember my dad has been abusive towards the whole family. From emotional abuse to physical abuse, we have all been victims. He has always justified it by saying if we weren't so terrible, he wouldn't need to resort to hitting. When I turned 17 he found out his precious daughter was not a virgin, and ever since then our relationship has been fucked. He held me at gunpoint and threatened to blow my brains out to put me out of my misery for becoming a ""whore"". Anyway, after everything my dad has put me through I have become mentally exhausted and after years of trying to make our relationship work he just expects too much out of me. I have always put up with his shit because he has his own mental issues. His mom was depressed and committed suicide, he suffers from ptsd, depression, has attempted suicide, ect. I know this sound messed but i know for a fact that he loves me, he is just an extremely damaged person who can't help the way he acts unless he gets professional help which i know he wont cuz he's a narcissist who believes he is perfect and godly smart. Which he is smart, he is successful super rich and talented, but none of that really means much when you can't even manage a relationship with your family without resorting to abuse.

Currently:

I moved out last year for my graduate university program and it was wonderful being on my own. After doing my bachelors at home while most of my friends were moved out i was extremely anxious to move out. Well, once i moved out i thought i would finally have my own life. But he still tried to abuse me from afar. he would call me all throughout the day (and exclusively facetime calls to see where i am). If i didn't answer, he would call me 100 times until i did and when i finally did he would threaten to cut me off if i ever didn't answer again and accuse me of being a whore and not answering cuz i must have been doing something bad. This has become mentally draining as I am 22 years old, i am a great student who got into a competitive graduate program and am on my way to do great things. I have always loved the person I am out in the world, but my dad is so psycholgically manipulative that whenever i speak to him he instantly makes me think i am a horrible disgusting person. To him, all the mistakes I have done in my life are so atrocious i should have killed myself (he has said this multiple times). It's all scarring, and yet i can't imagine a life with him completely wiped out. As mad as he makes me and as tiring as the abuse is, he somehow manipulates my mind into believing i still want to work to make the relationship work and make him love me. 

Since being quarantined with them, things got especially bad. The abuse was getting bad and I was very stressed out from my finals now being all online and needing to study in an inadequate environment. Well one thing led to another and i knew i had to get a break from here. So, i lied to them and told them i need to go back to my own apartment to get a few things done and that i will be back in a few weeks. They are extremely against me leaving right now especially due to corona, and do not trust my intentions of going there. Rightfully so, i suppose since i will be living with my boyfriend which they would never give their blessing to do. Anyway, i was excited for this opportunity to leave, but they believe i am coming back. At first i was determined to not come back, but again i have been dragged into the guilt. i love my mom and so i feel guilty not seeing her, but she enables the abuse by not stopping him or leaving him. I still love my dad despite all the pain he causes me because i guess i love the idea of having our happy times be permanent. I am a little worried about leaving for these next few weeks because he will continue to be abusive, call me 20 times a day to facetime and see what i am doing, if anyone is in the house, ect. I can't get the break i need if he does this, but i am also scared to not answer because he gets mental and crazy and knows my apartment address and would probably drive down to come get me if i wasn't answering. I just dont know how to manage this whole scenario because on the one hand i don't hate him enough to tell him to fuck off and not answer him, but on the other hand i know rationally i should hate him for everything he does to me and i don't deserve this miserable life he creates for me. It just sucks because nothing is ever black or white. There will always be the happy moments and the good things the abuser does for you that clouds over their abuse and keeps you complacent to them. I guess i just need some advice on how to finally gain the courage to leave for good or to establish boundaries so that i can still see my mom but not have to be subject to my dad's wrath...He's the type of man who if he finds out i lied to go up to my apartment he will literally beat the shit out of me, especially since it is in the middle of a pandemic and expects me to only serve the family right now",jampamcunningham,2020-04-30 14:07:52,0,1057,22.14,25.99,78.03,3.37,26.42,14.66,94.8,63.77,21.19,17.5,11.16,0.47,0.38,4.64,0.85,3.69,4.26,13.62,11.07,6.53,8.23,2.55,19.11,3.97,0.95,1.42,0.76,1.8,8.04,2.84,5.2,1.23,2.46,0.57,11.45,1.42,0.19,0.57,5.39,15.8,3.12,2.93,2.65,1.99,2.84,4.35,1.42,0.57,0.38,0.47,2.37,0.47,0.85,0.47,0,7.1,2.27,1.51,1.7,1.7,0.76,4.07,12.58,1.23,14.29,2.46,5.3,6.81,1.8,0.28,1.14,0.09,0.09,0.28,1.23,0.66,0.19,0,0.19,0.19,9.46,4.16,3.03,0.19,0,0,0,0,0.19,1.51,0.38,0
gb4dv5,I don't know how to approach my twin brother about the similar pattern of abuse that we experienced that he is now showing to his wife and 4 daughters.,"My SIL (25F) came to me earlier today with a plea for me (24F) to talk to my twin brother (24M, who would've thought) about some abuse. She told me she doesn't know the full extent of the abuse my family did to us, but she wants him to get help because she has feared for her life and the children's' lives. I'm at a loss for words. That's my flesh and blood, my best friend, someone I told my story to about sexual abuse, physical abuse, etc. from our family. I want to approach him, as I know I need to, I am probably the only person he will listen to, and I was asked to. He and I got in a fist fight a little over 6 years ago, and it left bruises of his fingertips on my arm, but he has treated me well since then. He has stood up for me in my worst moments, and much like he takes care of me, I need to confront him to not only take care of his wife and children, but also him. He may get angry, or upset, but I'm ready. I'm just so scared and sad that this is what is happening. I wish my family didn't treat us so badly. I wish I could've protected him and had been the only one hurt. I think I've finally been given a complete reason to never speak to my family again aside from my twin and his family.

&amp;#x200B;

But does anyone have any advice for what I could do, say, etc. to make sure I help him? I don't want anything to happen to anyone, but I understand if I have to make hard decisions. Therapy is most certainly on my mind for him. He has a lot of built up trauma he won't talk about. But should I talk to him over the phone like my sister in law suggested? My husband and I think I need to go to see him and talk to him. With the COVID crisis, I understand it's going to complicate things, but our area isn't hit badly, though I don't want to go out if I can avoid it. I just need advice.",theballinstalin,2020-04-30 14:11:30,5,404,24.87,51.98,20.65,2.25,17.57,9.16,94.06,61.63,24.5,20.54,12.38,1.24,0,6.93,0,3.96,3.47,15.1,9.41,4.95,7.92,2.23,20.3,3.22,1.98,0.99,0.74,1.24,6.68,1.98,4.7,0.99,1.98,0.74,17.57,2.97,0.25,2.23,6.44,14.6,2.72,1.49,3.96,3.22,0.99,3.71,2.48,0.5,0.99,0.74,2.23,0.99,0.99,0.25,0,9.65,4.7,0.5,2.48,1.98,1.24,4.46,15.35,1.98,8.17,1.49,3.71,2.97,0.25,1.24,1.24,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0.25,0,17.82,5.2,5.45,0,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,4.21,1.49,0.5
gb4gti,Why can't I move on?,"Hey
I'm 19 and I have been safe for years now, my life is great, I am going to university and having a good relationship with my mom ... 
However I can't move on, if seems like the stuff I went through are my entire and only identity
I can't stop thinking about it 
I don't feel anything, I mean I am not in pain bc even though it's my identity intellectually, I don't feel emotionally connected to the little girl I was who suffered I guess... 
I had therapy, I am on antidepressant and have been since I was 14 
I was hospitalized and had depression, anorexia and everything. I really ''embrass'' all my issues and lived them. I had time to grieve.
Sorry this is so messy and I'm not even a native English speaker so I hope it's understandable 
The question is, why can't I move on?

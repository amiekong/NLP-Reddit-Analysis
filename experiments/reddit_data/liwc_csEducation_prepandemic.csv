9tdrvc,Looking for math activity suggestions,"Hi everyone,

I teach programming to 11th and 12th graders at a CTE Center. We have 2.5 hour sessions so I get to spend a bunch of time and focus on programming. Some of my kids come out of high school having built some pretty cool projects.

At the start of this year I noticed that a bunch of them couldn’t type. I work with them daily and see improvement. We recently reached a point where they’re doing a bit more math. Nothing too complex,like converting seconds to days, hours, minutes, seconds kinds of stuff.

Anyway, I’ve noticed a decent chunk of them are really quite bad at math. I’m wondering what you all do to improve math abilities so they can continue to grow into programmers? We’re reaching the end of our typing exercises, so a bell ringer type activity would be awesome. Ideally something that starts at around a third grade level and scales to at least advanced algebra by the end would be great.",jessedockett,2018-11-01 14:36:34,3,173,79.83,67.8,67.35,91.5,14.42,19.65,89.6,49.13,13.29,9.25,4.05,2.31,0.58,0,2.31,4.05,6.36,15.61,8.09,4.62,4.05,1.16,15.03,5.2,2.31,1.16,1.16,4.62,5.2,4.62,0.58,0,0,0,8.09,0,0,0,0,10.4,2.31,0,2.31,3.47,1.73,1.16,1.73,1.16,0,0.58,0.58,0,0.58,0,0,9.25,2.89,3.47,1.16,1.73,0.58,1.16,10.98,0,18.5,1.73,8.09,8.67,8.67,0.58,0,0.58,0,0,1.73,0,0,1.16,0,0.58,13.29,5.78,4.05,0,0,0.58,0,0,0,2.89,0,0

9u5l7a,Hour of Code for everyone,"Hi all,

I live in a suburban city with great diversity and not enough resources.  Our schools have some programming available (after school only ) and make a  feeble attempt at hour of code - if at all. 

As a female programmer I was asked by one of our middle schools to lead an hour of code for kids after school. 

What curriculum can I use to reach our most poorly served communities ?  Are there any curriculum would particularly grab their interest ?  (I am thinking of having a separate night just for girls)

Do you have any idea on how to specifically reach out to the populations whose kids typically avoid coding at all, because that is whom I am interested in targeting specifically (although all are welcome of course),  Thank you.

a1a8n7,Hour of Code - work in pairs ?,"Hi, a few parents and I are teaching Hour of Code (code.org) to some students in our district, the school is excited and supportive of our venture.  We will be completing the Dance Party module and working with beginning students. Our community is diverse and we are targeting all students across that broad spectrum.

One parent participant (whom I greatly respect) mentioned that she thought it was better for kids to work in pairs so the weaker can help the stronger.  She happens to be the Department Chair for CS of a local University.

I (MS CS) disagree. I always learned far less when a fellow student clearly knew more than I did. I believe it is an unreasonable ideal that students would supportively interact with each other in a way that more sensitive students will not be affected and in fact be supported.

My concern is that in this scenario only dominant kids will walk out having felt accomplished.

We will have many parent and student volunteers on board to help the kids but the ratio could be at best 1:5.

Thank you for your thoughts.

TL DR:: is it better for students to be paired for Hour of Code, or better to work separately.",Jaxlee2018,2018-11-28 12:54:38,6,214,73.52,84.81,29.43,92.67,16.46,21.96,87.85,49.53,13.08,7.94,3.27,2.8,0.93,0.93,0,5.14,5.61,13.55,11.21,1.87,4.67,0.47,15.42,7.48,4.67,0.93,1.4,3.74,7.01,5.61,1.4,0,0.47,0,13.08,1.4,0.47,1.4,0.47,9.81,2.8,0.47,1.4,0.93,1.87,2.8,0.47,0,0,0.47,0.93,0,0.93,0,0,20.09,7.48,5.14,8.41,2.34,0.47,3.27,10.28,1.87,11.21,0.93,7.48,2.8,8.88,0.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.62,6.07,1.4,1.4,0,0.47,0,0.47,0,0,2.8,0

The course description is:
&gt;Prerequisites: CMSC 330 and programming experience in C or C++. An examination of the formal translation of programming languages, syntax, and semantics. The goal is to write programs that are constructed using program generators. Topics include evaluation of finite-state grammars and recognizers; context-free parsing techniques, such as recursive descent, precedence, LL(K), LR(K), and SLR(K); and improvement and generation of machine-independent code and syntax-directed translation schema. Programming projects that implement parts of a compiler are required. Enrollment Requirements: Prerequisites - CMSC 330 and programming experience in C or C++.

I'm going to try but I will not look back fondly when I think of this class

The only real programming oriented things I took from this are recursion, gcd, matrix operations, and modulus operations. But I learned this things before in programming classes and the approach was far more practical.

Thus is such and abstract class. 

Most of the time I felt like I was learning the theory of mathematics and something that is required to right algorithms.

My class was thought by a math PhD. She knows nothing about programming. Imagine working out a recusive algorithm by hand 10 times over.

Is this really how people did things before programming language was invented?

I have some ideas where i would like to go with a career from this, and i feel a CS degree would give me a range of knowledge that would otherwise be hard to come by.

My issue is i am looking around at Universities in the UK, and they usually require an A-level in maths and further maths.

Unfortunately, I didn't go this route after high school so I don't have this knowledge yet, so I'm looking if someone was in a similar position, and or what parts of mathematics I should focus on learning, honestly my maths is back from highschool, but I am now going through some Algebra courses on Coursea.

acfjez,Want to switch to BA instead of BS,"So  I have returned to college and have a bunch of transfer credit, almost  none of which applies to the BS but a good amount of which applies to the BA.

So with my transfer credit plus the lack of extra classes the BA doesn't have that the BS does like a few physical sciences and an extra math class, numerical methods or diff eq, this frees me up to take a  some extra classes I want to take, namely python and some web  programming classes instead of ""wasting"" my time on chemistry or math  I'll probably never use.

The BA is very similar but is admittedly the weaker degree, it lacks both Linear Algebra and Calculus 2 that the BS has, but I plan on taking  these classes anyway if I switch to the BA since it would make room for  extra classes. The only other differences are that the BA doesn't have Data Structures and Algorithms as a requirement, but is an elective option I plan on taking if I switch. The BA has more CS electives than the BS too.

Both degrees cover discrete math, data structures, compilers, and operating systems.

Is this a good idea? I've read that having a BA or BS in terms of a job search really doesn't mean much either way, and even if it did in a rare case, wouldn't it come off well to be able to say I took those harder math classes as electives even though I didn't have to?",csthrowawayblahblah,2019-01-03 22:46:57,5,260,62.37,4.55,24.83,69.28,28.89,15.77,84.23,54.23,10.77,5,5,0,0,0,0,5.77,9.23,12.31,9.23,6.54,8.85,2.69,15,6.54,3.46,0.77,0.38,5.77,3.08,2.69,0.38,0,0,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,14.23,0.77,1.15,3.46,4.23,0.77,7.31,1.15,0.38,0.38,0.38,1.15,0,1.15,0,0,5.77,0,1.15,0.77,3.08,0.77,1.15,11.15,1.15,7.31,1.15,4.62,1.54,8.85,0,0.38,0.77,0,0,3.08,2.31,2.31,0,0.38,0.38,11.15,2.31,4.62,0,0,0.77,0,0,0.77,2.69,0,0

adig1d,Drop out BCA and try for BTech? Confused,"Hey, I'm from India, throwaway because don't want people I know to know about this. This post may be trashly formatted and it might have a very bad title but I hope you understand my situation and suggest me a path.

I'm a Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) first year undergraduate student at a Top Private University in India. I completed school in mid 2018, I wasn't interested in Physics and Chemistry but I'm very much into Computer Science. From the beginning of 11th grade I thought I would study BCA and get an awesome job and live happily as a programmer. But deep in my heart I knew I was avoiding an Engineering Degree (BTech) because it had Physics and Chemistry in its syllabus, which I suck at. I thought BCA is BTech without Chemistry and Physics, I didn't do much research and came to this conclusion. As I sucked at Physics and Chemistry, there was no way I could get admission for BTech course.

My parents have 0 savings and my education is funded by my uncle, that too supported by a lie, I told him that my college fees is $450 whereas my actual college fees is $800 (I messed up real bad here) because he wouldn't let me study in a good college, I managed $350 by selling off my computer and other stuff.

I thought the college would be great and stuff they'd teach would help me become atleast a programmer but in the beginning 2-3 months, I understood that this sylabbus is not even 30% of what they teach in engineering courses.

I worry about my future career everyday. I always wanted to be a Software Engineer kind of guy since I started learning programming by myself. I regret not being serious about my studies in the last 2 years. I look at websites like Stack Overflow, etc and see they're offering jobs to fresh graduate engineers but there's no mention of BCA anywhere in a India, I should forget about getting jobs internationally.

Now, there's 3 months for the Common Entrance exam for Engineering courses. I told my parents that I want to drop out of BCA and go for BTech because I really want to be an engineer. I know I fucked up in the beginning. I know there's very less probability of getting a CS engineering course given my expertise in Chemistry and Physics and my financial situation. But I really want to. I am ready to study as hard as I can.

Please give me your views about this. Should I go for it?

I'm a 4th year HS teacher, second year CS teacher, and a 1st year CS teacher at my new school, an independent HS in the midwest.

I feel a little out of the loop in terms of CS teaching organizations, grants, and educational technologies. Does anyone have specific resources available that would bring me up to speed in terms of what organizations I should subscribe to, what grants are available, where CS education is currently heading, how I can get involved in my community, region and national organization, etc? I want to be in the loop and in the know about what's going on so I can make use of those resources.

Anyone have an idea?",jmawolcott,2019-02-01 10:30:07,2,64,82.6,21.73,82.31,7.63,12.8,37.5,75,43.75,9.38,4.69,4.69,0,0,0,0,4.69,4.69,15.62,9.38,0,6.25,3.12,14.06,7.81,0,0,0,1.56,1.56,0,1.56,1.56,0,0,7.81,0,0,0,0,23.44,7.81,0,3.12,10.94,1.56,7.81,0,0,0,0,4.69,0,4.69,0,0,6.25,1.56,0,4.69,0,0,3.12,7.81,0,9.38,1.56,6.25,1.56,6.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.62,4.69,4.69,0,0,1.56,0,0,0,1.56,0,3.12
amflop,"Child seems uninterested in programming, but wants to continue learning","I recently started volunteering at my local library teaching kids (8-12) the programming language Scratch. This is my first time teaching kids any subject. I am having trouble diagnosing the feelings of one boy I teach, and I was hoping you all could help. 

During lessons, this boy (named Jake), seems a little like he doesn't care about the lesson, usually preferring to mess around on the Scratch editor than learning what I am teaching. At first I thought maybe he was getting discouraged, since programming can be kind of difficult to some, but even with direct teaching and feedback he doesn't seem to want to learn. 

And honestly, that's okay with me. If he doesn't want to learn how to program, I get that programming just doesn't appeal to everyone. However, this is the real kicker: **when asked if he wanted to continue to the more advanced lessons, he said yes**. 

I just don't understand why someone would seem uninterested when being taught, but still want to learn the material? If I can teach this kid something about programming, a subject I am passionate about, then I'd love to. But I feel like I have to know how to talk to him, and I don't know what that entails. Does he have trouble reading? Is he actually uninterested, or is it a learning disability? Is there anything I can do to help him, or is that the responsibility of the parent? I just don't know. 

Sorry for the wall of text! Please help if you have any suggestions for how I can diagnose and fix this issue.

amtwf6,Coding Bootcamp Graduate: Questions On Further Study,"I’m from the UK.

Fact 1: I have a non-technical degree (political science / Econ) and have just graduated from Le Wagon coding 9-week bootcamp on a full-stack development course.  
 

Assumption 1: I could start applying for jobs now, but I believe that to have long-term success in my field I’ll need to undertake further study especially in information/computer theory and mathematics /statistics. 

Assumption 2: Rather than jumping straight into a Master’s program, it will make more sense to start from the fundamentals.

I would prefer to study an accelerated bachelors course (1-2 years) rather than undertake another 3-4 years of full time study. 

Do such programs exist? Which universities in which countries would offer such programs?

I would like to ask about online degrees. Is that a thing and is an online degree of the same credit as a full-time study programme degree? Does this kind of thing work in Europe, or is a an online degree from anywhere other than Europe accepted in Europe? Are there online programmes for computer science, and if so, what does it take to go through it if you're coming from a completely unrelated field of study and/or you're and ""oldtimer""? Are these online programmes open for anyone internationally? Do you have to write a thesis on something too like in a regular programme?

A lot of questions, I know, but I can't seem to find anything clear enough on the subject. Also any other clarifying information on important stuff regarding this kind of online education and I forgot to ask about it is also welcome!

He's still very incompetent at debugging. I try very hard to help him read error messages.

I try not to give him answers right away, but guide him to understand errors. I try to explain him that getting errors and being able to understand errors is an important part of programming. But he doesn't seem to make progress. After almost a year of taking CS classes he still texts me ""it gives error dude what do I do?"". How can I help to someone in this situation?

The unit is only 2 hours a week over the course of two months.  


Is there a type of code I can teach the children that is going to be most useful for their future but also easy enough to teach 8th graders?

So I have an unrelated bachelors in biology (FML), and rather than getting a second bachelors in CS, etc. I would like to get a masters in software engineering or software development. I am hoping to eventually become a software developer.

I am looking for noob friendly online masters degrees that require no background in CS; I would like to be able to just start it without any prep work. I am looking for masters degrees designed for career changers that have all the necessary prereqs built into the program, so that I can start right away. Preferably they would be online so that I do not have to relocate.

Anyone have any suggestions for programs? 

Some programs I’ve found that require only an unspecified bachelors degree with no CS background:

UPenn MCIT

BU MET software development

DePaul Software Engineering: Software Development

Thanks!

p.s. I am aware of Georgia Tech’s OMSCS and probably wouldn’t get in due to lack of prereqs. 

p.p.s.

azg5j7,I/O-only computing and its damage to students,"Going to be a kind of rant but I'd appreciate if you can give inputs because I'm on the desperate side.
What's wrong in introducing computer science like this?
On the book used by my school this is the introductory example for loops. Worse: it's even presented first as flowchart. (There's a nice post somewhere that shows how flowcharts are considered harmful, for obvious reasons).

int main() {
  int n, num, avg;
  int s=0;
  int count=0;
  printf(""how many numbers do you want to insert?\n"");
  scanf(""%d"", &amp;n);
  while (count&lt;n) {
    printf(""insert a number:\n"");
    scanf(""%d"", &amp;num);
    s+=num;
    count++;
  }
  if (count==0) avg=0;
  else avg=s/count;
  printf(""the sum is: %d\n"", s);
  printf(""the average is: %\n"", avg);
}

What I especially hate of this thing is the absolute focus on I/O and lost sight of anything that might be of interest for someone curious about computer science. Of course it's not only an introduction: all the curriculum and the examples are based on such horrible (and complete) programs.

I'm starting to think that this thing spoils students minds to such an extent that it's impossible to remedy: I have students of more advanced level (but started like this) unable to get away from this absurd mindset and consequently unimaginably lost when dealing with any computing problem, for trivial it may be, if I steal printf and scanf from them. They cannot believe their eyes when I build fragments of programs one at a time, and consider glueing them together in a main function just a last step that lets us try the result of our fatigue, they think that I should type the program in text order.

Of course the snippet is basic, it's easy, and we can see what the looping does. Unfortunately it also is not a snippet but a whole program, it's utterly impossible to decompose in an understandable structure, to see where the algorithm is (it's all mixed up with the I/O), and especially it's impossible to use it as a basis for extension, composition and abstraction: dealing with different problems will be a wholly novel experience and nothing can be reused from the knowledge of this thing. What indeed happens to my students is that they can copy that code and change one or two minor things but are completely lost if they need to use a loop in a different context: the loop knowledge is completely missing in them, and couldn't be otherwise.

What this intro to loops could look like (if desirable, I think we should desire something different):

int sum(int a[], int len) {
  int s=0, i=0;
  while (i&lt;len) {
    s+=a[i];
    i++;
  }
  return s;
}

The soul of the original loop is recurring on input data: here we have such input data made explicit instead of concealed, and an isolated loop that does its job and no more. Of course we need arrays: just because they're the computer scientist idea of ""some numbers"", cannot escape that, make it explicit and students will learn, conceal it and students will wonder in darkness. And of course arrays are pushed much later in the curriculum just because in C they're not exactly beginner-friendly, and that's (one of the reasons) why C as first language for young minds is not a good idea either: if it makes simple things difficult it's evidently not a tool for learners. Who in their right mind might assume C a beginner language? Let alone C++, where so called C++ examples are the C ones passed through s/printf/cout/.

Why on earth in 2019 have I to see the above nonsense on books targeting absolute novices of young age and having excited expectations on computer science, being born with a touchscreen portable device in their hands, completely unaware of what a text console interface looks like therefore bearing no engagement whatsoever working in it? Spending their time *actually typing the input numbers by hand at every new run of the program* instead of spending time using their brains and let the computers do the computations?

What in history went so wrong to end up in this situation and *making some teachers even believe that this is an actual way to go*? I have colleagues believing that the ultimate essence of computer science is if's and while's and printf's. Seriously? Where are abstraction power, information representation, composition of elements, dealing with complex problems by approximation, setting good hypotheses, computing interesting results from interesting inputs, the ability to build a real solution from ethereal materials?

I see students lose interest in computer science after being bored for a bit with memorizing this kind of programs. I see intelligent people unable of doing anything besides blindly copying code fragments and just hope it will somehow work, fully unaware of why. I hear some telling me that they like computer science more because I ask them to use their brains, and I see some angry with me because I ask them to use their brains, one thing is clear: they didn't use it before! I have students ignore that one beauty of computing is that things can change depending on the inputs. I see students entering school thinking that computer science is the heartbeat of our world technology and leaving thinking that it is unappealing, tedious, dull, not creative, something from which to run away fast instead of a tool that lets them leverage a power on information.

b2cnam,Thoughts on language for Intro to Data Science,"Next term, I'm going to teach an introductory Data Science class for the first time. In the past, others have taught it in either R or Python. My first inclination was to teach it in R because the language is specifically for statistics (and not a general programming language like Python). However, I see a lot of promise in Python's Pandas library. I haven't used Pandas myself, but I have more than enough time that I could familiarize myself with it. 

What are your thoughts on R vs Python vs a bit of both?

Course details:

* Prereqs include CS1 (C++) and Statistics
* Topics include the analytics life cycle, data integration and modeling, relational databases and SQL, text processing and sentiment analysis, and data visualization. Emphasis is placed on reproducible research, code sharing, version control, and communicating results to a non-technical audience.
* First of two DS classes as part of a DS certificate (Minor is &lt; Certificate is &lt; Major) with predominantly Comp Sci and Stats majors enrolled

b3z5f1,Best approach to tutoring a student who has trouble understanding the basics of program flow,"Not sure if this is the right sun to post to but it's the best one I found. I myself am a 20yo student in a CS-related field. I do some tutoring as a side job, mostly in maths and IT/CS. Right now I have a student who has to learn to program in VBA (don't even ask why). Not super-advanced stuff but hard enough that I have to think about it for a second myself as well. This student has mostly problems with understanding basic program flow. When he sees a problem, he will not know how to solve it. When I try explaining the solution to him he will eventually catch on and understand, but the next time with a very similar (or even the same) problem he will be stuck in the same way as before. Even when I point out that it's essentially the same problem, he will have a hard time catching on. He will also have a hard time understanding what input is needed to perform a function and what output it will give, and then how to use that output. He has a background in mathematics so this comes as a bit of a surprise to me.

I really want to help him get better, and in the process challenge myself to become a better teacher. I was thinking of giving him some starter programming exercises that teach basic program flow (loops, if statements, functions). My question is whether this would be a good approach. For one, many of the problems are at the least hard to translate to VBA. What's more is that he already has basic knowledge and skill on the basics. It feels a bit stupid to go back to the complete beginning. Lastly, he'd much rather work directly on his exercise (which is to create a minesweeper implementation in Excel) but right now that only costs a lot of unnecessary time spent on me trying to explain the basics over and over again and applying it to a more advanced implementation. I think he'd benefit more from actually experiencing more of the basics instead of me trying to explain them but he just has little time for that. On the other hand, it feels senseless to have to spoil the solution to him with many problems. That's why I'm asking you professionals which idea is better. I hope you're able to help me!",Creator13,2019-03-21 18:51:35,6,422,60.3,43.4,52.18,61.73,18.35,16.35,93.6,59.24,16.35,9.24,4.74,0,0.47,3.79,0.24,7.11,8.77,14.69,9.48,7.11,6.87,0.95,17.06,6.87,4.5,3.55,0.71,3.08,5.69,3.79,1.9,0,0.24,0,7.58,0,0,0,3.79,16.11,5.69,2.13,3.08,3.08,0.71,4.03,2.13,0.24,0,1.66,0.71,0.24,0.47,0,0,9.95,0.47,4.74,2.84,2.84,1.66,1.42,13.27,2.13,13.74,2.37,6.4,4.98,5.45,0.47,0,0.47,0,0,0.24,0,0,0,0.24,0,12.56,4.98,2.61,0,0,0,0.24,0.47,0,2.13,1.9,0.24

b61mqb,City NEWS sentiment analysis CSE Project by DITM College Students,"Newspapers and blogs express opinion of news entities (people, places, things) while reporting on an events. We present a system that assigns scores indicating positive or negative opinion to each distinct entity in the text corpus. Our system consists of a sentiment identification phase, which associates expressed opinions with each relevant entity, and a sentiment aggregation and scoring phase, which scores each entity relative to others in the same class. Finally, we evaluate the significance of our scoring techniques over large corpus of news.  


Automatic sentiment analysis regards the extraction of a sentiment from an unstructured source such as text, images or audio. The recognized sentiments can be classified as positive or negative, or a more fine grained sentiment classification scheme can be used. Sentiment analysis of text, also called opinion mining, only recently received a large interest from the academic community and commercial companies. What people write on persons, products or institutions has an important value in our society and the World Wide Web is an excellent source of such information. The automatic analysis of sentiments on data found on the World Wide Web is useful for any company or institution caring about quality control. For the moment, getting user feedback means bothering him or her with surveys on every aspect the company is interested in.  


Making a survey for each product or feature, designing the format, distribution and timing of the survey (sending a form right after purchase might not be very informative), and the reliance on the goodwill of people to take the survey are expensive and time-consuming tasks, yielding not always accurate results. Surveying by means of questionnaires can be made obsolete by gathering such Information automatically from the World Wide Web. One of the sources are blogs (short for “web logs”), a1 medium through which the blog owner makes commentaries about a certain subject or talks about his or her personal experiences, inviting readers to provide their own comments. Other sources are customer review sites and electronic discussion boards or forums, where people can discuss all kinds of topics, or ask for other people’s opinions. There are several additional advantages to automated sentiment analysis. Extracting these opinions is thus extra valuable. Second, opinions are extracted in real-time, allowing for quicker response times to market changes and for detailed time-based statistics that make it possible to plot trends over time. Last, but not least in information retrieval opinion mining assists in discriminating 7opinionated documents from documents that present the information in a neutral way. We are interested in the feelings that people express with regard to certain consumption products. We learn several classification models from a set of examples that are manually annotated, more specifically, from sentences that are annotated as positive, negative or neutral with regard to a certain entity of interest. We define an entity as the non-abstract subject matter of a conversation or discussion.

For the example, I'm making it a Skyrim spoof, more or less. I've got a couple of kids who play games like Skyrim and RDR2 so I'm hoping that they'll appreciate it!

Also, on a side note, does anyone have a good sort of template/graphic organizer for helping students create text adventure story-lines? I'm asking our English department, and have found an example one that I think I can fit to make work well. I'm not a great story teller (hence the use of a spoof), and am not as confident about helping students create a story line. I think that having an organizer would help my kids stay on some sort of track rather than just imagining it all in general and keeping track of it in their memory.",astrogryzz,2019-04-03 06:13:30,3,163,57.22,40.3,37.06,99,20.38,14.72,87.73,53.37,15.95,9.2,7.36,0.61,0,0,1.23,6.75,9.82,11.04,9.82,6.75,5.52,1.23,18.4,4.29,4.29,0.61,1.23,3.68,9.82,9.82,0,0,0,0,9.82,0,0,0,0,17.79,3.68,4.91,2.45,3.68,1.23,4.29,1.23,0.61,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.43,1.84,3.68,2.45,4.29,0,1.23,12.88,1.23,6.13,0.61,5.52,0.61,3.68,1.23,0,0,0,0,0.61,0,0,0,0.61,0,14.72,3.07,4.29,0,0,0.61,0.61,0.61,0,3.68,1.23,0.61

b9mwgt,The Tech Industry Needs More Women. Here's Why,"After doing some research on the topic, I realised there was a huge discrepancy between the number of males and females studying Computer Science and even in the industry itself. There are *2 primary reasons* for this:

1. Gender stereotypes - The tech space has always been generalized to be a rather ""male-dominated"" industry which tends to deter young girls from exploring the space. 
2. Lack of exposure - Young girls are not exposed to the possibilities and opportunities the industry provides. 

The tech space has seen the rise of so many wonderful female powerhouses that have aimed to bridge this gender gap that is present. Initiatives such as Kode With Klossy, Black Girls Code and Girls Who Code are some of many amazing movements that have come up over the years. 

Research has also shown that teams that have at least 1 women on board have resulted in a higher return on equity and net income growth. They are also able to bring in new perspectives that are necessary for new, innovative solutions of the future. You could find out more here.

bb06a9,What added benefit does a flesh-and-blood teacher or professor offer the beginning student of programming/CS?,"By benefits, I mean to say benefits that the student might not receive if relying solely on self-study with books and tutorials -- even if they were using **very good** books and tutorials.  What do you think an instructor can contribute to the learning process?

From personal experience, here's one that occurs to me: *A broader perspective on things that could cause code to fail*.  A couple examples:

**First:** I once had a student whose code repeatedly failed to run and he spent a while troubleshooting it, to no avail, before he met with me.  Once I got there, I looked at his code, and immediately noticed that he was surrounding a text string with 

    ‘curly quotes’ rather than ' straight quotes'

Once he fixed that issue, his code was now working!  Though such an error might pop out quickly to someone more experienced, I found it perfectly understandable that a beginner might not realize it could be an issue.

**Another:** I often teach beginner students with Python as the language of instruction, where *indentation* of code blocks is syntactically significant.  Students usually understand the need to indent their code blocks, but they might later encounter syntax errors caused by inconsistency in their indentation:

* Mixed tabs and spaces
* Inconsistent number of spaces for indentation

This often leads to syntax errors when attempting to run their code, which they may not identify as the issue, on their own.  However, when they come to me for help and show me their code and the error messages, I can help them sort it out because it *occurs* to me to look for that issue.  Ideally, they will remember the lesson and be that much better at their craft in the future. :-)

What do the rest of you think?  What extra value can students get from an experienced, dedicated programming teacher or tutor?",cg_kelly2013,2019-04-08 15:36:32,7,326,61.47,57.31,42.97,54.65,25.08,19.94,84.05,53.68,16.87,9.82,3.68,0,0.61,1.84,3.68,7.06,6.44,12.88,6.44,4.91,6.75,1.23,12.58,4.29,2.45,2.76,1.53,1.84,3.68,2.45,0.92,0,0,0.61,9.82,0,0,0,1.84,13.8,3.99,1.53,2.15,4.29,0.31,3.68,2.15,0.92,0.31,0,0.61,0.61,0,0,0,9.82,1.23,2.45,5.21,2.76,0.92,3.68,7.06,2.15,12.58,1.84,4.91,6.44,8.59,0.61,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.86,2.45,4.91,1.84,0,1.23,0.31,1.84,0.31,1.23,0.31,6.44

bhrsk9,Tech. Ed. Teacher Career Advice,"Greetings! I would really appreciate any advice from any Tech. Ed. teachers, don't know how many subscribe to this sub. I originally considered posting in r/teaching, but r/CSEducation seems more appropriate. Please alert me if this post is inappropriate in any way, though I believe I am adhering to the rules.

My name's Steve, and I live in Philadelphia, PA. I graduated in Spring of 2018 with a degree in Middle Grades (4-8), all 4 main content areas. I have a passion for engineering, problem solving, robotics, coding (well I have started to teach myself and have been making progress), and technology, and thought what better way to encompass that passion professionally than to become a Middle School Tech. Ed. teacher.

Unfortunately, the only two schools that offer masters programs for Tech Ed. in PA are Millersville and California U. of PA, an hour and a half and a 5 hour drive respectively. So not really possible unless I were to stop working for school, which financially I can't afford to do.

As of now, it seems the best route is to take the Technology Education (5051) Praxis, and then get my Masters of Education in Integrative STEM at TCNJ (they offer in-state tuition if you live within 40 miles of TCNJ, which I do. This route was recommended to me by both a member of TEEAP, as well as the assistant superintendent that I know (Hilariously he suspended me over a decade ago when he was a principal of my high school, but my delinquent days are over and he has been happy to assist.

Does this path seem like a good plan? Would I be an attractive candidate having a passing Praxis score and the STEM masters? I know it's not exactly a Tech Ed. masters, and I don't want to pay mad loot for a degree that won't help me achieve my dream.

bk67f6,Why Git and Git-LFS Is Not Enough for Machine Learning Reproducibility - and How To Achieve It with Data Version Control,"Keeping the data under version control with Git-LFS is a big improvement. But the lack of version control of the data files is not the entire problem.

The determining factors for the results of training a model or other activities include the following:

* Training data — the image database or whatever data source is used in training the model
* The scripts used in training the model
* The libraries used by the training scripts
* The scripts used in processing data
* The libraries or other tools used in processing data
* The operating system and CPU/GPU hardware
* Production system code
* Libraries used by production system code

Obviously the result of training a model depends on a variety of conditions. Since there are so many variables to this, it is hard to be precise, but the general problem is a lack of what’s now called Configuration Management.

[DVC (Data Version Control)](https://dvc.org/) takes on and solves a larger slice of the machine learning reproducibility problem than does Git-LFS or several other potential solutions:

bodt47,Teacher Certification,"Hi, I have over 10 years of UI/UX, Web Development work experience and 3 years of ICT teaching experience overseas - I was teaching at a certified school on letter of permission, as I have work experience but am not currently teacher certified.  I would like to go back to teach overseas after I become teacher certified.  I realize that to teach at Canadian offshore schools you must be a Canadian certified teacher, and I'm currently traveling overseas so the only option for Canadian online accredited school right now is Athabasca University (it's slim pickings).  But the cost is quite steep and program does not look quite as good as some American universities offering 120 credit accredited online degree programs.  So therefor, as a Canadian I'm looking at obtaining American Teacher Certification (if possible without living in USA), and teaching IT overseas to offshore schools in the following countries: Australia, Europe, Asia, Middle-East, and South America.

Does anyone know if it's possible for a Canadian to become American Teacher Certified after going to school at an American University (NAU) and doing the degree online while never actually living in USA?  Or will I need to become a resident of USA before obtaining American teacher certification, even though I am Canadian and I live quite close?

Also, if American Certification is not possible for Canadian residents, I am open to the idea of European teacher certification, I hope there are some ties there for Canadians?

brhmy8,High School Computer Science Courses Opinions,"Hello, I am looking to improve my high school's computer science program.  Currently, we offer 3 CS classes:  
**Intro to Programming with Java**

\- Variables/Data Types  
\- Conditionals/Decision Structures

\- Loops  


**AP Computer Science A**

\- Classes/Objects

\- Arrays/ArrayLists

\- Inheritance  
\- Sorting/Searching Algorithms  


**Programming with Python**  
\- Variables  
\- Conditionals/Decision Structures

\- Loops  


Next year we are adding a new CS course:  
**Computer Programming Language and Systems**

\- Foundations of Computer Languages including Python, C++, and other C derived languages.  


Personally, I find that some of these classes are redundant and could be combined, leaving more room for other courses.  I am just asking for opinions on what CS courses should be taught in high school and what the recommended order would be in taking these classes.  Also, I am asking for opinions on our current courses and how they can be improved.  
Any comments, positive or negative, are appreciated.

bz2r1t,"QCircuits, a simple quantum computing Python library","Hi all, I am the developer of QCircuits, a Python library for simulating quantum circuits.

I wrote this library while learning from the popular  [Nielsen &amp; Chuang textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=nielsen+and+chuang&amp;qid=1560195853&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1), and my aim was to create a library with all the functionality required to implement the quantum algorithms from the book, with as simple an interface as possible.

You can install with `pip install qcircuits` for Python 3.4+, and it should be OS agnostic.

Documentation is available at [http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/index.html](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/index.html).

Tutorial is at [http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/tutorial.html](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/tutorial.html)

Example applications, including quantum teleportation, superdense coding, phase estimation, and Grover's algorithm are at [http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/examples.html](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/examples.html)

The code is on github here: [https://github.com/grey-area/qcircuits](https://github.com/grey-area/qcircuits)

With the library, you can:

* Create states from tensor or Kronecker (vector) representations, or prepare commonly used states such as computational basis states, uniform superposition states, Bell states, etc. [See here for a full list](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/qcircuits.state.html#state-module).
* Create gates/operators from tensor or Kronecker (matrix) representations, or create common operators such as the Hadamard gate, Pauli gates, CNOT, Swap, Toffoli, etc. [See here for a full list](http://www.awebb.info/qcircuits/qcircuits.operators.html#operators-module).
* Create composite states/operators via tensor product of states/operators of subsystems.
* Compose operators, e.g., A(B(x)) = (A(B))(x)
* Apply an m-qubit operator to a specified subsystem of an n-qubit state, where m &lt; n.
* Perform measurement in the computational basis on a subset of a state's qubits.
* Compute the Schmidt number of a system with respect to two subsystems.

Once I'd developed the library, I found I was often *using* it to test my understanding of some concept or example in quantum computing. I'm hoping that others might find it useful too.

Constructive criticism, feedback, and feature requests are of course welcome.",grey--area,2019-06-10 13:18:33,2,392,95.15,43.92,6.67,69.07,24.5,27.55,55.87,28.83,4.08,2.55,2.04,0,0.51,0,0,1.53,6.38,9.95,3.83,2.3,3.83,0,6.89,3.06,1.02,0.26,2.3,0.77,2.81,2.55,0.26,0,0.26,0,1.53,0,0,0,0,9.44,3.32,2.55,0.51,2.55,0.51,1.53,1.02,1.02,0,0,2.04,0,2.04,0,0,2.81,0.51,1.28,1.02,0,0,1.28,3.32,0.77,5.61,0,4.34,1.02,9.18,0.26,1.02,0.51,0.26,0,3.32,0,3.32,0,0,0,52.55,11.99,6.89,0.51,1.28,0.26,0,2.81,0,1.02,7.14,20.66

I also provide group therapy in the school system so I work very close with educators and staff and have a tremendous amount of respect for you all. We are seeking elementary school teachers (kindergarten to 5th grade) to participate in a brief online study (about 10 minutes). We believe teachers play an important role in children’s lives so it is important for us to work with and communicate with teachers.

The purpose of the study is to identify the different expectations and attitudes teachers may have towards children.

bzhj2e,Should I quit college?,"Hello everyone. I'm a CS college student. I'm about to finish my 5th semester. Right now, I'm taking Compiler Theory, Operating Systems and Software Engineering, apart from other non CS related courses. 

I'm thinking about quitting. There's some stuff I just don't understand. And even if I do, I grasp the concept for a moment and then forget about how it works. Right now I'm struggling with virtual memory in my OS class. Next semester I'm supposed to take Analysis and Design of Algorithms, which some of my friends are already taking and describe it as extremely hard and very math focused. I'm dreading it right now. Hell, I think I didn't deserve to pass my Discrete Mathematics courses. 

The more I spend studying CS at college, the more topics I learn about that make me think: ""Halting problem, CFS scheduler, RB trees...This will never be useful **for what I want**"". I'm a fullstack web developer and I love doing it. And I think my purpose is to create digital services that are useful to people. Right now, I just want to work on my projects and make them something I can live from. But the grinding of college is exhausting and not making me happy.

I had two reasons for staying in college: The first one is private and no longer valid because it depended on something that is over. The second one is to socialize. When I enrolled, I didn't know what it meant to be a computer scientist. I just knew that I enjoyed programming (started with C++ at 15y.o.) and that I wanted to code for the rest of my life. Now I think: Maybe I don't need to be a computer scientist. Maybe I can just be a regular developer and still achieve my goals. Still, I don't know if staying in college gets better or worse.

I don't live in the US and where I live it's common that it is one's parents who pay for college at a monthly basis. So I'm not in debt. My parents never went to college and neither their parents. But it was not a choice. They just couldn't pay for it. Now they expect me to have a degree and I know they would be super proud of me if I finish the career. 

I spoke with my dad the other day about quitting and he said: ""The only reason I'll find acceptable for you to quit college is if you find something better. Like Zuck or Steve Jobs"". And man, I really want to find that ""something better"". I want to start working towards that. But idk if I'll be able to get there while grinding a degree that I'm not sure I'm smart enough to finish. Or at least, smart in the way that a CS career requires.

So... that. Idk what to do.",itsnotag,2019-06-11 13:12:14,8,485,19.09,6.89,91.07,60.96,12.12,17.53,91.96,58.35,21.24,14.02,12.16,0.21,0.41,0.21,1.03,7.22,4.74,11.55,9.9,7.22,7.63,3.51,20.41,4.12,2.27,1.65,1.03,1.03,4.33,3.09,1.24,0.41,0.21,0,4.95,0.82,0.21,0,0.62,16.49,4.74,2.27,3.3,3.92,1.03,4.54,0.82,0,0.41,0.41,1.44,0,1.24,0,0,7.42,1.44,3.71,0.62,2.06,0.62,2.89,15.67,1.03,11.13,0.82,4.95,5.57,8.66,0,0,0.82,0.21,0,0.82,0.21,0.62,0,0,0.41,20.82,9.28,2.89,0.82,0,0.21,0,0,1.24,4.74,0.41,1.24

It's been good to me and I've enjoyed it, but it's time for change. I'm looking for a (preferably on-line or near the Chicago area) program where I can essentially just get the credits I need in the shortest amount of time, without worrying about formal degree requirements for the CS classes. Although I know there are some gaps in my formal knowledge, I feel very comfortable with computing in general. I have to believe that I'm not the only self/professionally taught developer who's come up against this, so I would be very thankful if anyone had helpful suggestions.

​

TLDR: I was a professional programmer for the last 25 years, but I have almost no formal CS education. I'd like to teach CS in high school. I need 24(ish) semester hours of CS and 12 at the upper division for a secondary endorsement for my (future) teaching certificate. What's the absolute fastest and easiest way to get those credits? I don't want or need another degree, just the credit hours.",student_c,2019-06-19 06:25:14,7,254,66.56,12.68,84.8,82.25,19.54,26.38,88.19,52.36,13.78,9.06,9.06,0,0,0,0,4.72,7.09,14.96,10.63,5.12,5.91,1.57,16.93,5.12,3.15,1.57,1.97,1.18,3.94,3.54,0.39,0.39,0,0,3.54,0,0,0,0,11.02,1.97,0.39,2.76,3.15,0.39,4.33,0.79,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,7.09,0.79,0.39,4.33,1.57,0,1.97,12.2,1.18,14.57,1.57,8.27,5.12,13.78,0,0,1.18,0,0,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,0,18.9,4.33,3.54,0.39,0,0.39,0,1.18,0,4.72,3.15,1.18

When a student is matched to a college, they receive a full scholarship which pays any and all expenses to that college. However, the match is binding except to Stanford, MIT, Yale, and Princeton.

As it is binding I'm skeptical about picking colleges from QuestBridge as I plan to major in computer science and there is a lot of great computer science schools that aren't part of it.

I'm focused towards industry rather than research and I've looked at the programs of numerous schools including those on QuestBridge. However, I'm having a hard time comparing them based on the opportunities they provide for careers. Are there any resources that give information about colleges for industry?

I've attached the list of QuestBridge colleges if you want to see. For reference I'm also mainly concerned about cost and my states' safety will most likely be free for me.

**play\_notes(\[""A3"", ""C4"", ""E4""\], 2000\]) # 2 second A3 minor chord**

Unfortunately, I was unable to go to the APSI. 

I'm trying to visualize how things are going to go next school year, but I could use some examples from experienced teachers (or former/current students with thoughtful feedback based on their own experiences) on the following classroom aspects:

1. Do you do paired-programming? What does that look like in your classroom? (I barely know what this is, but I love collaboration and discussion in class)
2. Do you assign homework, as in a specific assignment to be done for the next class? What are your policies for that work?
3. I feel like plagiarism will be a big temptation, what is your experience with it?
4. What kind of long term (quarter year?) projects would be appropriate for this level? (This is the only programming class offered at my school, so any prior experience will be students self-teaching). 
5. What does a day in your class look like? (I have 41 min. periods, FWIW).
6. Have you ever organized a speaker series? What was your experience with that?
7. What do tests / quizzes look like in a CS class? How do I grade CS assignments?

cicceh,30% of students confused about Python on a fundamental level,"Hi everyone,

I'm teaching a summer course in CS, and I use Python in my class. I had been using CodeHS for a while, and now I switched to Python in PyCharm and we do exercises.

I feel like 30% of my students are confused about Python on a fundamental level. Like they don't have an intuitive sense of when to use If statements, While loops, for loops or what order these statements go in, and when to use variables. I'm struggling to teach them how to organize these ideas and how you are supposed to use these ideas as tools to accomplish some task.

It was a little easier to teach this stuff when I was using CodeHS, we were working with Tracy the Turtle. However, back then it was different.",BlueLensFlares,2019-07-26 20:00:17,2,142,45.49,38.9,83.15,8.79,17.75,15.49,87.32,59.15,16.2,9.86,6.34,1.41,0.7,0,1.41,6.34,4.93,17.61,9.15,7.04,11.97,0.7,16.2,3.52,3.52,4.23,1.41,0.7,2.82,0.7,2.11,2.11,0,0,4.93,0,0,0,0,18.31,4.23,5.63,0.7,4.93,2.11,2.82,1.41,0,0,0.7,0.7,0,0.7,0,0,8.45,2.11,1.41,4.93,0,0,4.93,10.56,0.7,14.08,0.7,7.04,6.34,7.04,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.08,4.93,5.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.11,0,1.41

cjeqno,Code annotation tool I developed for University CS courses,"Hi everyone!  A few years ago, a couple other CS undergrads and I built a code annotation and grading tool for our department. Since graduation, we discovered that the tech industry really emphasizes human code reviews. We were lucky, but unfortunately many of our peers from other schools didn’t receive much feedback on their code in college. So a few months ago, we decided to return to the tool we built and make it publicly accessible for any university to use. 

We recently launched our tool as codePost ([www.codepost.io](http://www.codepost.io/)), which any university can use for free (if you want really fast support, we also offer a paid tier). 

Basically, codePost was built to make annotating student code with feedback really easy. It doesn’t replace an auto-grader and doesn’t automate human feedback -- it just makes it much easier to annotate code (think Google Docs style commenting) and manage the nitty gritty details of doing human code review for courses with many students and possibly many graders. So it’s easy to upload student work, apply a rubric consistently, manage a team of graders, do QA, etc. 

Here's a 3 minute [interactive demo](https://codepost.io/demo/?product_tour_id=53617) if you want to get a feel for how code annotation in codePost works. 

codePost is a new tool, and integrating new tools with old tools can be a big pain. To make it easy to slot codePost into existing grading workflows, we built a [RESTful API](https://docs.codepost.io/reference). Some of our users have used the API to connect codePost with their LMS -- incl. Blackboard and Canvas -- and automatically pull in test output from autograding environments.

Maybe that’s something that gets you excited immediately - maybe not. In any case, we’d love feedback from anyone here.

* Is this a tool you could see yourself using?
* Even with a good tool, we know code review requires a scarce resource: human time. If you don’t do code review in your course because of resource constraints, is there anything else we could build to make code review tractable for you? 

Thank you!",codePost,2019-07-29 10:52:18,4,368,72.04,86.74,5.02,71.66,17.52,21.74,74.46,41.85,12.23,7.61,0.82,3.8,2.45,0,0.54,4.62,5.43,10.87,5.98,4.35,5.16,1.36,11.96,4.08,0.82,0.54,0.54,3.53,3.53,2.99,0.54,0,0,0,10.33,0,0,0,0,13.04,1.63,3.8,1.9,3.8,0.27,3.26,0.82,0.27,0,0.54,0.54,0,0.27,0,0,8.7,4.89,0.82,1.63,1.63,0,2.17,9.24,0,7.34,1.36,2.45,4.08,11.14,0.27,0,0.54,0,0,0.82,0,0.82,0,0,0,24.73,6.25,4.35,0.27,0,0.82,0.54,2.17,0,2.17,3.26,4.89

cleukz,PSA for High School Teachers in the United States,"I am currently a rising senior and am planning to major in computer science in college. I owe a great deal of where I am today to my incredible computer science teacher, whom I have had for several years. In addition to providing me with endless encouragement and inspiration, she introduced me to an opportunity that has opened doors for me that I didn't even know existed. 

The award is called Aspirations in Computing and it is given by the National Center for Women and Information Technology. It is designed to recognize and encourage high school girls (9th-12th grade) with an interest in technology and who see computing in their future in some way. It is awarded at a lot of different levels, from National Winner (top \~40 in the nation out of 4000+ applicants) to ""Rising Star"" (those who are newer to technology but show a lot of interest and promise). The application consists of a few short answer prompts and a short recommendation from a CS teacher, robotics coach, or someone in a similar role. It typically opens in September and is due in November.

When my teacher first told me about it, I didn't plan on applying. While I did some techie stuff outside of class, I certainly wouldn't have considered myself a ""tech person"" and I tend to shy away from ""Women in Tech"" stuff for whatever reason. However, I did eventually turn in the application and I am SO glad that I did. Winners at all levels are invited into an exclusive online community where members post all kinds of opportunities, network with others, give and seek advice, offer to give professional referrals and just generally support each other. I literally found a tech internship as a HIGH SCHOOLER through this group, which has been a phenomenal experience and has led to a myriad of other opportunities itself. I also found out about a really cool tech competition that I'll be entering in a few weeks. We also have a really great tradition where recent HS grads will help current seniors with their college applications each year. 

In addition to the award itself and the online community, there are also some college scholarships specifically for winners. We can also apply for funding to run tech outreach programs in our communities. 

TL;DR There's a really awesome award that your female students (at all levels of technical experience) should apply for. Please pass the opportunity along to them and continue to encourage them in their journey. You can find out more at [aspirations.org](https://aspirations.org) 

Thank you for reading and for inspiring your students every day! If you have any questions, please feel free to comment below or send me a private message.

cmeb3n,Automate Grading of Correctness?,"Hey everyone, been lurking here for a little bit. I'll essentially be teaching ""Intro To Programming, Using Java"" this Fall.

I've gone back and forth on how I want to handle grading. The students will have ""Labs"", which will be small in class coding assignments that they can work on solo or in groups. Additionally, they'll have ""Assignments"" which will be one to two week programs that they are to write alone. 

In terms of grading, I'm aware that I'll need to go through each submission, by hand, and give them feedback on

- commenting
- organization
- architecture
- etc

as they'll be new. That being said, I have a great deal of interest in leverage Unit Tests to perform grading for correctness. For example:

Imagine their tasked with writing some Calculator logic:

- addition
- subtraction
- division
- multiplication
- exponentiation
- etc

For each submission, I'd run my suite of unit tests to tell me their correctness score, which is how logically correct their program is. Then, I'd by hand, go through their submission to make sure they're understanding everything else not related to correctness.

I'd probably have to download their submissions zipped from the school's website and then run my suite on my machine. 

Does this sound crazy? Too ambitious? Are there other tools I'm potentially not thinking of? I'd love to use Github and utilize pull requests to kick of some CICD, but that's too overkill for right now.

I am looking for a particular potential web hosting service and hoping someone out there may be familiar enough to know the answer or a lead. I would like the web hosting service to have multiple to unlimited FTP sites, mySQL DB server installed and Python also installed. Hostinger comes very close to this but has PHP, which is fine and I can always change one of the labs to use PHP instead of Python, but I would really love to introduce the class to Python over PHP if possible. 

Also one question that is more IT. When a web host says they will give you unlimited sub domains, does this also mean unlimited FTP sites, or are we talking two different things?

I'm going to contact a few others on their North American retailer list and as but was just curious if anyone else had any good suppliers for the classroom.,GrowHI,2019-08-13 11:14:15,3,87,77.56,45.43,33.18,69.12,21.75,32.18,79.31,43.68,10.34,3.45,2.3,0,0,0,1.15,6.9,8.05,10.34,6.9,1.15,10.34,0,16.09,8.05,4.6,1.15,1.15,3.45,4.6,3.45,1.15,0,0,1.15,9.2,0,1.15,0,0,16.09,4.6,0,2.3,8.05,0,8.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.6,1.15,0,2.3,2.3,0,8.05,4.6,1.15,5.75,1.15,3.45,1.15,10.34,0,0,5.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.49,3.45,0,0,0,1.15,0,1.15,0,2.3,2.3,1.15

crmgud,Tackling Multidisciplinarity in basic programming courses,"Hello!

I'm starting a small research project around teaching programming. In my university, we have one central course that is offered to people from a lot of different majors.

My aim is to find a way to show the students the different applications that programming can have to their specific field. The problem is that we have - in the same classroom - students from a lot of different backgrounds.

Did you have had any experience in such scenario? I'm starting this from the ground up, so any idea, cases, papers, opinions and so on are welcome.",fbidu,2019-08-17 06:58:49,2,101,84.18,65.41,48.61,25.77,12.62,27.72,92.08,51.49,11.88,7.92,3.96,1.98,0.99,0,0.99,3.96,8.91,15.84,12.87,3.96,2.97,0,14.85,6.93,3.96,0,0.99,3.96,1.98,0.99,0.99,0,0,0,7.92,0,0,0,0,10.89,1.98,0,0.99,3.96,0.99,2.97,1.98,0.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.9,3.96,0,4.95,0,0.99,1.98,12.87,0,12.87,0,10.89,1.98,14.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.84,4.95,4.95,0,0,0.99,0.99,1.98,0,1.98,0,0
csa01i,Finalizing my undergraduate honours project idea,"I am in my last year (4th year) studying Computer Science. I had the opportunity to be interning this summer in a research centre that do big data analytics ( data analysis, predictions, visualizations, time series analysis etc). Despite the field of expertise my team was focused at, my job was mostly being as a data engineer helping in building a data pipeline for one internal project they were working on. The project's objectives was to showcase some sensors in an Internet of things environment. Therefore, I had some good experience getting exposed to how IoT platforms works and implemented one for the project. 

Luckily, I was granted an extension to work with them part-time this fall. And my manager expressed his interest in collaborating with the professor whom I would choose for my honours project. So it's like hitting two birds with one stone. The professor I chose to work with has research interest in Data Science/analytics and mining software repositories. 

I had a meeting with my manager about any possible project I could work on this fall that could count towards my honours. He mentioned he would like me to integrate the use of Power BI software as good analytical tool to use within the team. Basically preparing biweekly presentations to my team on how to use Power BI when dealing with their tasks. On the other side, my honour's supervisor (professor) mentioned to me to come up with an idea that could deal with handling a data set, propose some questions on it, and eventually visualize/analyse it. Despite the fact that I have a limited experience in data science, I am very keen to include a flavor of it in my project. 

So I have been thinking about an idea that could combine both fields together (IoT framework + Data science/analytics). If you could suggest me an idea on what possible ideas I could make a project out of it that could be reasonable for it to be done in a matter of 4 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any further questions or want me to clarify something further, post it here and I would reply promptly with more clarification. ( Since I feel I am all over place and dont know how to explain this properly). 

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I know I can go and meet both sides again to gain more insights on what I could do. But the point of me posting here is because I want to come up with couple ideas first before meeting them. So this would be more like a preparation for me.",cymricc97,2019-08-18 18:09:28,1,441,75.39,34.14,69.36,79.5,20.05,25.4,86.62,52.83,15.65,10.2,8.16,0,0.45,0.68,0.91,5.44,5.9,16.33,9.07,3.85,4.76,0.23,12.93,2.04,2.27,1.59,1.36,3.17,2.95,2.95,0,0,0,0,5.44,0,0,0,0.68,15.42,5.67,2.49,3.63,3.4,0.45,1.59,0.91,0,0,0.23,0.68,0,0,0.45,0.23,7.94,1.13,3.85,3.85,1.13,0,2.27,8.16,0.91,12.93,1.13,8.39,3.17,9.75,0.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.38,4.76,2.49,0.23,0.91,0,0,0.23,0,0.68,2.27,1.81

It is an open source Java-based framework used to create a micro Service. It is developed by Pivotal Team. It is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications. Spring Boot is a project built on the top of the Spring framework. It provides a simpler and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications. 

Spring Boot provides a good platform for Java developers to develop a stand-alone and production-grade spring application that you can just run. You can get started with minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup.

Data warehouses are used as centralized data repositories for analytical and reporting purposes. It is challenging because of the following reasons:

* Data is sorted in different ways by different systems
* Data might be updated at different times for each data source
* Data might not make sense to the end user, in its current form

All of these and other challenges can be solved through the use of a data warehouse: [What Is A Data Warehouse?

d2oin1,Source Optics: graphs &amp; analytics for group projects,"Hi everyone,

First time post here but wanted to share something.

I'm part of the teaching staff for undergraduate Senior Design at NC State University (http://sdc.csc.ncsu.edu), where we frequently have about 30-50 projects of 3-4 students each going on each semester.  (I'm also the original creator of Ansible, if you happen to have heard of that...). Anyway, a problem we have is we want to get engaged and make sure group dynamics are working great, but it is often hard to tell this from group discussions.

We use GitHub, but students may be working on multiple branches, and it is a challenge to understand the true nature of what's going on with just the insight graphs in GitHub.

To solve this problem, we had students start a project last semester called ""Source Optics"", which I've been continuing this semester.

It's an open-source Django+PostgreSQL project, the code is \*fairly\* straightforward, and we are also working together with Duke to merge some great visualization ideas from a tool they have.  At NCSU, we also hope to extend this to be usable for some other classes, like Software Engineering, which has even larger number of students and projects.

There's an optional mailing list for in-depth updates you can sign up for, but ""[INSTALL.md](https://INSTALL.md)"" is also an easy way to get it installed.  I'm quite up for all kinds of idea discussion, so shoot me an email at the address linked in the URL above if you like and I'd be glad to hop on a hangout sometime  with any professors, high school teachers, or staff that might find this interesting.

There are a lot of commercial applications so that's kind of why the webpage speaks to it that way. 

Some things are obviously still a little rough, but we have a lot of features yet to do (see GitHub) but I'd say it's totally usable today and it's a great time to get involved if you are interested and have ideas.  Curious to hear your thoughts!

dabcfv,Teaching JavaScript using codeguppy.com,"Do you still remember the home computers from 70s, 80s and early 90s (Commodore 64, ZX-Spectrum, etc.)? Although they were very primitive from technical point of view, they had a big educational value. They provided a simplified coding platform that was very approachable.

This smooth entry to programming is no longer available.... Actually this was the goal of [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com) \-- to recreate the experience of those early computers.

[codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com) presents a simplified coding platform based on processing API (p5.js) as well as other libraries for manipulating sprites, sounds, etc. You can basically draw with code (e.g. use circle(), line(), rect(), etc.) ... or create mini games using the included assets and easy to use APIs (e.g. sprite(), sound(), music() )

The site is still in beta... but there are already many sample programs included.

If teaching coding using this approach is something that interests you, then give [codeguppy.com](https://codeguppy.com) a try. It will be great if you can share your experience!!!

dcn7dy,"For students thinking about applying to graduate school for computer science, do not apply to UC Davis","University of California, Davis has decided to change degree requirements for people obtain a Master's degree for Computer Science. This could be staying or even not being able to graduate despite stating in orientation the exact requirements needed to graduate.

Details:

1. There are three options to obtain a degree: project, thesis, or exam. You cannot change the way you obtain your degree once you have declared which path. This issue affects people who are taking the exam route.
2. Previously, if you were a graduate student, you would not need to take an exam as long as you got A's in three core classes. These classes would be in systems, application, theory, or architecture.
3. Now, graduate students that have been at the school for a year and are trying to graduate this upcoming school year are forced to take an exam even if they met the requirement of getting A's.

Thoughts:

1. This is unfair as people have planned their schedule around the information that was given since starting the program.
2. The exam is a common exam, not based on the classes people took, as everyone has taken different classes for their graduation requirements.
3. Had people known this, many graduate students have expressed they would have chosen a different route.

Therefore, for students considering UC Davis for their graduate degree program in computer science, I would say to avoid it. Administration has shown that they do not care for their students and are punishing them for the mistakes they made. Many students have voiced concerns only to be met with that ""they must deal with it"" and the university is not honoring the fact that these students should only be bound by the degree requirements that were in place when they entered the school.",throwaway1001201901,2019-10-02 23:49:17,7,315,71.46,66.02,6.16,16.66,15,23.17,88.25,50.48,11.75,6.03,0.32,0,2.22,0,3.49,5.71,6.98,13.02,11.75,3.17,4.13,2.22,20.63,2.54,1.9,0.95,2.86,0.63,1.9,0.63,1.27,0.32,0.32,0,9.21,0,0,0,0,14.29,1.9,2.54,3.81,2.54,1.27,4.76,0.63,0,0.63,0,0.32,0,0,0,0.32,8.89,0.63,2.22,3.81,3.17,0.32,5.4,10.48,0.32,8.57,1.27,4.44,2.86,16.19,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.65,6.35,4.76,0.95,0,0,0,0,0.63,0.95,0,0

dd2eus,"Java, old friend, how dearly I have missed thee!","A lot of what I'm posting here is personal opinion and my rambling thoughts, though I do like to think those opinions are at least well-informed by practicality and experience.  :-) Moreover, even though these are my own thoughts, I am interested in hearing yours, too.  Any questions raised, any topics invoked -- around language of programming instruction and other related things.

A bit of background and various things that informed my thinking:

* When I first starting *learning* to program, Java was my first language -- and my primary language for much of my own CS education.  As such, many of Java's unique and eccentric features feel natural to me, and I quickly got in the habit of being meticulous enough to keep a compiler pleased.
* When I first started teaching programming -- intro-level for college students -- Java was also the department's official language of instruction, so I spent plenty of time stressing the importance of remembering the semicolon at the end of a statement, properly nesting your symbol pairs (e.g., curly braces), capitalizing ""String"", \*\*not\*\* capitalizing ""public"", and so forth.
* A few years on, my department chose to start using Python instead of Java for intro CS.  I did have a bit of an adjustment period, but I was able to switch to teaching intro CS in Python instead.  Indeed, I **did** come to appreciate certain aspects of Python for teaching beginning programming: being able to write a ""Hello World"" program in **one line**, common syntax for sequences (i.e., strings, tuples, lists), distinct uses of while-loops vs. for-loops, and easy applicability to a REPL environment -- to name a few.  

So, when I've taught intro CS in the past several years, it's been in Python, and it's worked well.  Every now and then, I will even throw in a tidbit like, ""Oh, by the way, this is how it would work differently in Java...."", just as a teaching moment.   Also, I have thought that maybe the absence of Java's syntactic requirements might be helpful when first starting to write code.  In other news, thought, the syntactic significance of *indentation* is something I have found to be a double-edged sword:

* On one hand, I like the fact that it encourages a habit of indenting parts of code according to their level -- if and else clauses, function definitions, etc.
* On the other hand, it can be confusing in a scenario where the indentation **looks** correct to the eye but has an ""invisible"" flaw that confuses the Python interpreter.

Finally, I always did miss certain things that were available in Java: **switch** expressions, increment/decrement operators, and assignment operators that also return a value...among others.  Granted, such things are largely down to personal preference, so your mileage may vary.

Fast-forward to the **present**, where I am once again teaching an intro Java class, and a short while in, I realized just how much I sincerely **liked** about Java as a language of instruction:

1. *Compiling* a program and *running* it are distinct phases, which I find helpful in explaining and distinguishing different types of errors: syntax/semantics vs. ""exception"" scenarios vs. incorrect results.  
2. An upside to a strong typing system, for both data **and** variables, is that it (ideally) fosters a habit of being type-conscientious as you code.  Keeping in mind whether a numeric value is supposed to be a **whole number** or a **decimal** \-- and how that affects calculations -- is a good thing, in my opinion.
3. An incredibly picky compiler that demands precision in syntax and datatype-usage can (again, ideally) foster a good habit of being attentive to detail.  For example, I like the fact that single-quote and double-quote are **not** syntactically interchangeable -- simply because that is also true in many other contexts, such as the Linux Bash shell environment.
4. Scope.  Just...**scope!**  Nested scopes, class-level scopes, object-level scopes, namespaces, variable shadowing, etc.  I **love** the way Java's highly-structured approach to code blocks makes the issue of scope more explicit.  
5. Finally, for teaching fundamentals of **object-oriented programming**, I consider Java objectively superior.  (Get it?  *Object*\-ive? Ha!)  Starting with primitives as a distinct type of data, I like to go into explaining how those are used to form more complex data types in the form of **objects** and **classes**.  Attributes, methods, public vs. private vs. protected visibility, method parameters and return values, and inheritance are much more explicit in Java.  If I want to show students a bit of UML, it maps so, so nicely onto actual Java code.  And the distinction between **reference types** versus **object types** \-- along with method overriding -- lends itself extremely well to a discussion and demonstration of polymorphism.  

Of course, the point here is not to promote one language as being overall superior to another -- neither for teaching, specifically, nor for programming/development in general.  There are so many languages out there with spectacular advantages **and** notable disadvantages, and I like to make sure students know this.   I wouldn't try to write a device driver in Ruby, nor would I attempt to use C to write a script for managing files/folders. When teaching how to program, different languages will recommend themselves in different ways.

What about you?  What are some of your opinions about one potential language of instruction versus another, and how are they informed by your knowledge and personal experiences?  When you need to make a choice, what factors ultimately prevail?  How do official departmental policies and expectations figure into it?  I look forward to hearing from any and all who elect to chime in.  

Best of luck to all in the ongoing semester!",cg_kelly2013,2019-10-03 21:23:25,3,954,76.13,38.85,49.76,87.12,19.88,25.68,78.51,47.48,10.27,5.45,4.19,0,0.94,0,0.31,4.82,6.18,14.47,6.08,6.5,8.07,0.73,12.37,3.67,1.99,2.41,1.78,3.46,4.93,4.09,0.52,0.21,0,0.21,4.82,0,0.1,0,0,13.84,3.25,1.99,1.15,2.62,2.31,3.67,1.26,0.42,0.21,0.31,0.73,0.31,0.21,0,0.1,5.77,0.73,1.78,2.62,0.94,0.21,2.52,7.34,0.73,11.01,0.94,6.08,4.51,5.35,0.21,0,0.31,0,0,0.63,0,0.1,0.1,0.42,0,34.17,6.08,8.07,0.73,0,0.63,0.42,4.19,1.26,0.94,1.15,10.69

dlbbj9,Just saw the worst CS education program today.,"I just spent the day looking over and working through CMU's new CS curriculum. I have to say it is the worst curriculum I have ever seen. It borders on educational malpractice. The entire first section is about drawing pictures using a function with parameters. Does it explain what a parameter is? Nope. It uses ""python"" in a web interface. No explanations of what the parentheses are for, why quotes around things, uses camel case without ANY explanation to students at all. Just, do this unexplained thing to get the picture to do x or y. And do it exact or the autograder won't let you continue. It is absolutely insane and the entire state of PA is promoting this steaming pile of poo as quality because it is coming from Carnegie Mellon University.   The whole point of the first section is adding and remembering lots of options for 1 function. And we are talking hours of student work for NO reason at all.

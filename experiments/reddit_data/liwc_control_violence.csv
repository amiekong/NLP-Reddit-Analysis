ag2dp5,Help dealing with emotions after abuse.,"Hi everyone. 

My relationship with my ex ended at the beginning of this January. In around November I think it was, he gave me two beatings. Both times I had a bit of a black eye, lumps on my head/face, bruises all over my arms and some on my legs, not to mention losing quite a bit of hair. The first time my nose bled a bit, and I ended up vomiting. The second time he held a bread knife to my throat and luckily only cut my hand which now has a mild scar. There was another time where I was hit in the face, but it was just that, though my jaw hurt quite a bit on the side I was hit on. 

For some context... We were living together for about a month including when these incidents happened. I had run away from home, and I couldn't leave all bruised up after the first time. I took the blame for the first one, it was my fault, and I provoked him. We were in the car and he was dumping me because he thought that I slept with other people etc. before we were official and I've been lying about it because I told a few lies about my past (even though he told many lies and slept with others behind my back in the beginning and ended up cheating twice). So I started losing it. He had hit me in sex sometimes and a few slaps outside of the bedroom that I didn't think much of. He bought me some tissues because I was being basically hysterical after the build up of these accusations. So I started throwing and hitting the tissue box, screaming and crying that I hadn't done anything and I was sick of being accused. At one point I think I did hit him with the box. Maybe I shouldn't have done that... Maybe he would've just kicked me out of the car instead of smashing my face against the dashboard. Even when he stopped, he paused for a second, then started again. The other times it wasn't provoked, but to him I deserved them all because I'm a liar. I made him do it. 

I never cried about it really at the time. It's really upsetting me now. Many nights I lay in bed and I remember these times. I can hear myself scream, I can hear my hair ripping, I can taste my vomit. The screaming is the worst. 

I feel like such an idiot for letting it happen so many times. Everyone said he would do this, and I chose not to believe them. At the time I felt like I wasn't allowed to be sad because it was my fault, he's the real victim. Maybe I just didn't respect/love myself enough to leave. 

After these times I noticed I was becoming more aggressive over time, and before I rarely ever got angry let alone aggressive. 

We are no longer dating and we aren't in contact. I don't want to be. I have since realised he might be a narcissist (not because he's my ex).

I don't know what to do about how I feel. I don't know who I can go to. I've told one online friend, but he didn't have much reaction. I don't want my friends or family to know because then there will be so much drama. I don't want to tell the police. I have no evidence, and I worry that if I tried to ""destroy his life"" like that he would do worse. I have had thoughts of self-harm and I often get really angry thinking about this and then I start thinking about hitting myself or something, but I haven't. Any help is much appreciated.

NB: Not sure if relevant but I'm 18 year old woman living in England.",kleinebanane,2019-01-14 16:17:43,9,655,19.22,13.91,92.8,1,14.24,12.98,94.05,62.44,22.29,16.79,12.52,0.76,0,3.21,0.31,5.5,5.65,12.06,11.3,6.56,7.33,3.36,20.46,3.21,1.98,1.07,1.68,3.51,6.41,0.76,5.5,0.31,1.98,1.07,9.01,0.15,0.46,0.15,3.21,14.35,2.9,2.14,1.53,2.9,1.22,4.58,2.44,0.31,0.92,0.92,3.66,1.98,1.07,0.15,0.31,6.41,2.29,1.07,2.14,0.46,1.07,8.55,9.47,0.76,14.5,1.07,5.19,8.4,0.15,0.31,0.61,0.15,0,0,0.46,0.15,0,0,0,0,16.03,7.63,3.36,0.15,0,0,0,0.15,0.31,3.51,0.61,0.31

I love my partner but sometimes when he gets really mad, things get way out of hand. I forgave him a lot of times. He always apologises. 

After that rhere would be no violence for a few months but it keeps coming back. Then he's gonna apologize again and I'll forgive him. It's like a cycle. 

I know he loves me and that he doesn't mean it.

I wanna work things out and I wanna believe that he can change.

aghk5l,My spouse [31] and I [26] got into a domestic dispute this weekend and my world just got flipped upside down.,"Hey guys. I'm new here but just looking to vent or look for some sort of helpful insight.

My spouse and I got into a very heated argument over the weekend, infused by alcohol. It got really intense and physical. As he was leaving the apartment, to cool off and find a ride to his friends place, the cops were called as the neighbours had called them. He was arrested on the spot and I was approached by an officer to give a statement and be treated as the victim. That is literally all I can remember from the night. 

We just recently moved to a new province (we're in Canada) and we were really getting excited and enjoying our new life. We have absolutely no history of any type of abuse on either one of our ends. This is not in our nature as individuals or as a couple. We have been together for over two and a half years.

The provincial law treats all domestic disputes at the same level - whether it is extremely violent or a first offence. We are on no contact conditions and just waiting for the legal process to begin. 

I have no family here. No friends and no support. I'm living in our home by myself without a job ( we relocated due to his military career so I had to leave wverything behind).

He has began seeking counselling and legal representation. I have reached out to victim services and found out what I can do on my end to get this process going and ensure that it works out in our favor.

I guess what happens now is we wait to see if the Crown dismisses the charges that the police put forward or they continue with the charges. He has a lot going for him as he is not a threat to society, has been an excellent employee throughout his work career and has no history of abuse or criminal activity. 

So I just sit here and wait for a phone call with an update, try to take care of myself and hope that he is not in too much pain.

Not sure if anyone has experienced this before but It is literal hell on earth.

well this turns a switch on him and he becomes violent w all his strength. choking, slamming my head by my hair, kicking me in the chest, and his favorite is twisting my wrist as far as he can get it and bending it. also pushing my face down by the jaw. then i always start panicking, telling him i never want to see him again, and he gets really sad and cries and freaks out to get me to forgive him.

ah6y6y,I just can’t sleep,"My ex violated the protection order I have against him, twice. I made a police report both times, and he’s been charged for the first one so far. Once the second police report is finished, he will he charged for that one, too. I gave the da the number the officer gave me, and they are on the lookout. They told me that a first conviction of violation is a misdemeanor and any convictions after that are felonies. I hope he gets convicted of both and therefore has a felony record. 

He had a bond arraignment hearing today, and I wasn’t able to get ahold of the victims advocate with the da to hear how it went. It’s got me on edge though. I just don’t feel safe. I want to go far away, but I have school and having my parents around to help with my kid is just invaluable.

He sent my mom an email last week that was awful. He made me feel unsafe, made her feel unsafe, and just completely attacked my character with any and all possible methods. He accused me of being a pedophile, of having relations with an animal, of hacking his computer, and more, much more. I am no longer used to this kind of degradation. 

I can’t sleep because of how scared he makes me. I think he must know how much he affects me even now and gets some sort of sick satisfaction out of it. I’m lonely. All of my friends support me, but none of them know what it’s like. I’m grateful for this because I wouldn’t want that to happen to any of them, but they just can’t understand. 

I’m sorry for the jumbled thoughts, but I’m not feeling well at all with this emotion.

ah71gd,What are my options? (Harrasment)," Me, my fiance, and baby are in the prosses of moving out. We have till the end of the month. Today as I was leaving to go to work, our roommate's father ordered me to give him the mail key so he can ""check the mail."" A obvious lie. (Our roommate has a mail key of her own, plus she was on her way home. They just dont want us to have the key.) I told him, his daughter has the spair and that we will not return it till we move. He got fired up and followed me out to the driveway demanding the key. He got in my face, started cursing at me and even spouted racist Asian slurs. I argued back, kept telling him no. Then he flinched at me like he was going to physically attack me. I stood there yelling at him. ""What you're going to punch me now?"" Note that he is twice me size. He backed off and went inside when he noticed the neighbors kids were watching us.
 There is a camera in the garage that caught it the entire incident, however our roommate is refusing to give it to us.  ...as expected.

  Is there anything we can do law wise in Nevada? Does him acting like he is going to physically harm me in my face count as a form of unlawful harassment?

ah7sbo,Need help with name change ideas (New identity after fleeing abuser),"Hello everyone. I am a 24 year old woman who recently escaped her abuser. I won't go too much into detail, as I will probably post my story another time, but I still have concerns for my safety and that is one of the reasons I am getting a legal name change. The other reason is that my current name is tied to a side of the family from whom I am estranged and have traumatic memories. This name change is an important part of my healing process and something I was thinking about even before I escaped.   


I am having trouble choosing a new name even though I have filled out the rest of the required paperwork and have the money i'll need to pay for it.  I am looking for a name that is feminine, fantasy-esque, and/or unique. These are not ""musts"", just a general idea of what I am looking for. I am not interested in being another Sarah or Lindsey (no offence meant to anyone with those names!). I do, however, want a name that I could reasonably use in day to day life.   


Every time i've never named a pet, character, or anything else, i've chosen the best names when brainstorming with people or when pouring over tons and tons of names and seeing one that stood out to me or one that I slightly altered and then loved.   


I won't be able to post here what I end up choosing (for safety reasons) but anyone who is willing to spitball some pretty names would be doing me a huge favor as i'm feeling very stumped right now.  I am going to be changing both my first name and my surname, but I am having the most trouble choosing a surname right now.  


Thanks in advance, and yes, I know this is an odd request, but it's very important to me!",Foxelette,2019-01-17 22:47:07,2,329,30.82,20.59,95.69,60.34,21.93,16.72,93.62,58.05,18.24,10.64,10.33,0,0,0.3,0,7.6,6.08,11.25,12.16,5.17,7.9,1.82,17.93,3.95,2.43,2.13,1.52,3.04,5.78,3.65,1.82,0,0.91,0,8.51,0.3,0,0.91,0,15.5,4.26,2.74,1.82,3.95,0.91,4.56,1.22,0.91,0,0.3,1.22,0.3,0.61,0,0,6.99,1.22,1.22,2.43,1.22,2.13,1.22,11.85,1.82,14.29,3.04,4.26,6.38,1.22,0.61,0.61,0.61,0,0,0.3,0,0,0.3,0,0,13.98,3.95,4.26,0,0,0,0.61,0.3,0.61,2.13,1.82,0.3

aha7jg,Just left tonight and I need help breaking the cycle.,"We were together 18 months, I left 5 times total and went back every time. Always left for the same reasons, he used all his chances. 

He never hit me but he would puff out his chest and get in my face and not let me pass...  for example. 
He would just berate me with verbal abuse.
Pressured me and forced me to do sexual stuff that I didn’t want and then gas light me later that I actually enjoyed it? 
He would punch things, spat on me, broke a door off the hinges.. 
Controlling...
Alcoholic, aggressive 

I don’t know know if I’m writing that out because I need to justify leaving so I don’t feel guilty.... or if I’m just trying to paint the picture.. or maybe I’m trying to justify the fact that I’ve suffered even though I wasn’t physically hurt.... 

I feel bad for him, there is no going back this time, but how do I stop feeling guilty? 

I feel guilty about breaking his heart, leaving him in the lease, for my dad calling the police when I asked him to come and help me leave..

I don’t think this post is going anywhere... I think I just need therapy to get over this.

ahd2bo,Feeling trapped,"So I've been with ""Ron"" for almost 4 years now. Things started out magical, and we were head over heals in love. We understood each other and were able to communicate with extreme ease. All that changed when I was in a terrible accident that left me in the hospital for about two weeks about 6 months into our relationship. Now, Ron was very supportive (I found out later, he had punched a wall when he heard the news and wasn't as calm as I had been told). He took care of me, cleaned out apartment and made sure everything was running smoothly.

Now I was at the point were I was just about to start college when my accident happened and I was intending on dropping out - my program coordinator thought I would be able to recover and then do school from home online. Didn't work. Oh well. So as first semester is going along and I'm just a vegetable on the couch from a fractured vertebrae, Ron is growing tired of me ""mooching"" and ""not putting out"". So we start fighting, mostly at this point about the stupidest things in my mind - he was mostly upset I couldn't finish my meals and that I was wasting a lot of food which meant I didn't appreciate everything he does for me. Just for clarity - I have always paid my half of rent, and paid for almost all the groceries up until this point. 

So Christmas happens, I fall on my ass down a set of stairs and this was like a switch for him. He LOST his FUCKING MIND! Screaming at me for being so stupid and reckless when I know how easy it is to paralyze myself (all in front of my entire family). I was fine - but in a serious amount of pain that I felt that I needed to play off to calm him down to assure him that I was okay and that it didn't hurt. 

This is the turning point in my mind. 

Over the next few months, I was able to start walking and started to attend classes on campus 2 days a week - I was fucking stoked!!!!! I was absolutely proud of myself, receiving the highest grades the program has ever seen in 15 years and I did it all on my own, under the influence of some serious pain meds. 

All this time, I thought our relationship was getting better. I was focusing on positive things and I was getting stronger and healthier each week. 

Now- summer time comes around and me and Ron are in our office and I notice a strange email as we were sitting trying to find an email in his outbox. So I asked him ""WTF, is someone emailing you about sucking your dick for from craigslist?"" I was shook, but just very respectfully asked him. Instead of a normal conversation he exploded and threw his desk chair right at me - missing but hitting my desk that my grandfather had built for me. 

I proceeded to ask again, which didn't work - he became angrier. I went to a different room with a laptop and checked his outbox - I found dozens of emails from him going out to craigslist about him having sex with other men. Now I'm confused, angry and have no idea whats happening and he is continuing to tell me I'm insane and that he's done nothing wrong. So I laid in bed for a week and tried to forget everything. Meanwhile, he deletes his email so I can never see what actually happened. I know he cheated, he denied it and called me insane. 

I'm going to skip ahead about a year now - Things have sort of been getting better, Ron still has serious anger issues and I've pretty much almost moved on from the confusion of not knowing if he actually wants me or not. I haven't actually confronted him saying ""you cheated"" in fear of another explosion. 

We were visiting his mother and she had mentioned she just got over a cold sore the day before. We were outside sharing a joint and then his mom passes it to me and then I smoke - because thats what you do when someone passes you a joint. Instantly, Ron starts yelling at me and his mother for being so careless and stupid and that his mom just gave all of us herpes. So this doesn't just stay here at his moms. He continues to be angry about this for two weeks, driving around erratically when he was taking me places, drinking and just full out self destructive behaviour. 

So when I'm at work one night, I get a text saying that he isn't going to come pick me up because he's too drunk to do so. At this point I'm extremely worried - he has spoken very suicidally about his life in the last few days so I leave work, race home to make sure everything is okay. He instantly got angry when he saw me and started yelling how I ruined everything and I ended our lives. I obviously yell back that it isn't a big deal and he proceeds to grab me for the first time and starts squeezing my throat. I thought I was going to die. The next day he apologizing and says how he used to never be like this before me and he acts this way because he loves me so much. I told him he needs to get therapy and fix the holes he punched through the walls. (which he never actually did) Two weeks later, he proposed to me and I was so confused, I said yes but I told him that things need to change and he needs therapy. 

So at this point, I've graduated - I got a kick ass job with a great starting salary! And he is trying to keep me home and away from my office. Any time I went to work, I had to call him to let him know I made it safely. If not, I would be bombarded by dozens of calls and texts. Texts would start nice, but one would come in every 10 seconds and got increasingly more demeaning the longer it took for me to respond. It would come to the point were if I didn't answer my phone, he would threaten to take his own life because I apparently didn't show any care in the world for it. 

So eventually, things became too much and I left my job to work with Ron on his business. We ended up leaving our home, having to move in with my parents while we looked for another house to rent. We were attempting to plan a wedding but he didn't want anything that I had envisioned for our day. Things became hard again and at this point I began speaking to an old fling about everything that was happening. 

So we finally get a house, move in and then he starts telling me that I feel different to him like another man has had me. He keeps telling me that if I cheated its okay just tell him and we'll move on. I had not seen anyone or thought about being with anyone else. Ever. 

After a month of this, I finally grow the balls to leave. I got a room for rent, paid the deposit and was ready to leave. While I was checking out another place without him knowing (said I was going for a walk - the place wasn't very far) I came home to all of my sentimental items from my grandparents broken outside in a trash can. It felt as though he killed them on me and I was loosing them all over again. I was destroyed. I had never felt so betrayed or hurt in my entire life. He did this because some random guy sent me a message on facebook. Very harmless conversation. So I called my parents and asked them to help me move everything out of that house and that I was leaving him. They came and helped (they weren't nice about it and didn't make me feel good whatsoever). So the morning after, Ron comes to me and says how he's the one who should leave and that he knows I didn't cheat on him. So I agreed, I told him that it was my house, I pay for it, clean it, take care of it. We break up at this point and he moves into another room in the house. 

December rolls around, about a year after the first incident of the choking, I was back at a trade show for my side ""hobby business"". He's going through all of my computer and old phones when I'm not home and decides to explode infront of my booth at this trade show saying that I am a ""lying cheating whore"". He made a massive scene and said if I didn't leave then I didn't care about him. So to try and calm the situation, I left the trade show - against my contract and I'm pretty sure I'll never be aloud back at this trade show because of all of this. He drove like a complete maniac almost hitting other drivers - he knows doing this scares me from my accident and does it to show how he has more control over me. When we finally made it home, he is continuing to explode and tell me how I'm such a slut and every other name in the book. There was nothing I could say or do to calm him down at this point and he grabbed me and told me how he was going to kill me. He grabbed my neck and that was the last time I ever thought I would breath again. I lost consciousness this time - it felt like I was out for hours and then the worst part...I woke up because I felt something warm between my legs. I urinated myself from being strangled. Now after researching I understand how close to death I really was. I didn't realize it at the time though. He was just shaking me and telling me to wake up. I was in a panic and didn't remember what happened - so he told me and made the choking me thing seem like no big deal and that passing out is just what happens when you choke someone out. 

Now at this point, I have no idea what I was thinking. I remember my brain was really foggy and that I was talking SUPER slow because the words just weren't coming to my head and the words I was thinking were taking forever to make it to my mouth. I just know that I wanted to violence to stop, I wasn't going anywhere and I wanted him out. He wasn't leaving though. I was worried about what he would do to our dogs if I left them in his ""care"".

Two weeks pass, Christmas is a fucking disaster and I lay in bed for my entire holiday break. He continues to sulk and be an asshole. Then again, twice the same situation occurred within a week. It starts with him yelling at me that I'm a whore and then I tell him to stop. He continues and then eventually gets so angry that he grabs me by the neck again...twice more. This time he is telling me that its happening because I don't know how to leave him alone and that I'm a whore and deserve it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was also told on many occasions that this isn't abuse and that if I was to run away to a shelter that women would laugh at me and tell me how good I have it. That this isn't abuse because he doesn't ""beat"" me. Its been a week since the last incident, my voice box is completely fucked, my throat all the way to my ears is swollen and sore that I can barely eat, talk or swallow.   
I've been doing my reading on strangulation and how much damage it really can do. At this point I don't know if I should just quietly leave or if I should get the police involved. I know I want to see a doctor no matter what at this point, I'm afraid theres been permanent physical damage. 

I don't know what to do that will cause the least amount of damage to me and to random third parties. I don't want him to drive away and end up killing an innocent driver or pedestrian. I'm also afraid of phoning the police and them doing nothing and making things worse. I'm also afraid of him ignoring any restraining order that I want to file and him showing up at my place of work and hurting me here. I'm afraid that if I leave, he will find me and he will end up killing me. I just want us to separate and live our lives to the fullest - because I deserve that.",fragilebrokenwings,2019-01-18 09:54:30,5,2189,18.62,32.73,81,8.02,19.72,13.39,95.07,61.85,23.25,16.86,10.46,1.05,0.27,4.75,0.32,6.4,4.25,13.2,9.23,6.9,9.23,2.28,20.79,4.34,1.69,1.55,0.96,1.96,6.03,2.24,3.75,0.69,1.64,0.37,10.92,0.5,0.05,0.37,4.89,12.2,2.19,1.83,1.64,2.33,2.1,3.38,2.65,0.59,1.05,1.01,2.79,0.78,1.1,0.46,0.41,6.21,1.78,1.46,1.69,1.14,0.37,8.13,9.5,1.32,16.63,2.88,6.99,6.9,1.69,0.46,1.05,0.69,0.09,0.32,0.91,0.59,0.05,0.23,0.09,0,12.84,5.12,2.47,0,0.09,0.05,0.32,0.87,0.82,2.56,0.46,0.09
ahd6kc,Eldest daughter needs help for mother.,"I used to think my first post on reddit would be something to do with my animals, my loving relationship or my siblings. Unfortunately thats not the case. 

My mother has been married to her husband, not my father, for about 14/12 years. Since I was 4, Im now 20. And I remember happiness in the family before. 

My mother has her own problems, she was very emotional abusive to me and always swung, which helped me grow up to a caring person I am today. And recently she had been trying to fix it so our relationship will become better. 

I had decided to fly out to meet my boyfriend of 3/4 months (LDR) and week one of us being together, I get that dreaded phone call. My step father had been cheating on my mother and my mother, trying to save their marriage, decided to take them to a counslar. The next day, last night, he attacked her after he was basically telling my siblings my mother is crazy. From what I gathered, he hit her and she was crying on the phone and all I could do is stare at my boyfriend in shock. The woman who raised me with an iron fist was on the phone with me, shaking and crying. My mind was a blur but after being calmed down, my boyfriend informed me to tell her she needed to call the police. Now Im in Washington State and they are in New York. I am about to call the domestic violence number for them as my mom still feels unsafe. 

As her eldest, I feel like Im not doing everything I can and my first thing was to get on the first flight back home and protect my mother and my siblings. I know it wouldnt help as I was an emotional wreck. 

Now as a eldest sister, pleading, what else should I do to help my mother overcome this and somehow make it out okay?",kittenthewiccan,2019-01-18 10:06:13,2,340,39.41,65.99,69.84,2.47,17.89,12.65,92.94,59.41,22.06,18.24,12.65,0.59,0,3.82,1.18,3.82,4.41,14.71,11.47,3.24,5.88,1.18,20,4.71,2.94,1.18,2.94,0.29,6.18,1.76,4.41,0.59,0.88,0.59,19.12,5.88,0.88,6.47,2.65,9.71,2.65,0.88,2.06,1.76,0.88,1.76,1.76,0.29,0.88,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,12.35,6.47,2.35,2.35,1.18,1.18,6.47,10.29,0.29,12.94,1.47,4.71,6.76,0.59,0.88,0.88,0,0,0,0.59,0,0.29,0.29,0,0,11.76,5.29,5,0,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,0.59,0.59
ahe3ge,Is it common for the abused to think they're the abuser?,"My mother is the abused one and anytime i talk to her about going to the hotline and stuff, she always acts jumpy and claims she's the one abusing him. She's aware he's abusive towards her but she claims to also be abusive when she isn't.

They fight a lot, and my mom is a really stubborn person who stands her ground when in a fight, but in no way is this abusive.

Is this some form of gaslighting? Is it common in abusive relationships??

ahfla1,Looking for stories of inspiration after DV,"Has anyone left an abusive relationship with a significant other and found a new healthy and loving relationship with someone else?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having trouble letting go of the hope that my abusive husband will change. We separated months ago and our time as a married couple is drawing to a close via a divorce. I still have hope that he will change, although I have seen no evidence of this and know that the odds are against me.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I should take a break and not think about finding love again, however, I'm looking for your stories of inspiration. It may help me to know that someday, I will find love again...someone who truly cherishes me, respects me, provides the loving intimacy that I seek.

ahfwvu,New user- about me and dependent tax question,"Hi. I’m new to reddit. I’ve been in an emotionally abusive relationship for about two years now with the father of my youngest daughter. It’s been elements of financial, emotional, threats, intimidation, theft, gaslighting and blaming.. everything. I’m tried. Our latest fight was a result of me not wanting to let him borrow something of mine. In that he refused to watch our daughter so I can go to work (he doesn’t work, I only asked while he finds a job- he watches her so we can avoid childcare costs.) 

It then turned into threats of calling my job, attempting to get me fired, threats of getting my kids taken away from me, confessing to recently cheating, etc. I haven’t blocked him because I’m endlessly hoping he’ll come through and help out and be at the very least, a dad. But his love is so conditional. If we aren’t good, he acts as if our child doesn’t exist. It hurts. He told me the other day that he claimed our daughter on his taxes- which I think is a bluff- but I am slightly worried about having to go through the process of whatever comes with that- as I’ve already filed and claimed her. Has anyone ever had to go through this?

ahg2gj,My abuser cost me everything including my daughter and pretended to be the abused one. I don't know what to do. None of it matters except getting her back but I keep hitting walls. Need advice please.,"I am a 39f living in Illinois. My ex (39m) has terrorized my life for the last year. Lost our house leaving us homeless, was extremely abusive the whole 6 years we were together but it got way worse after he lost our house, caused me to lose my job, stole the money I got from my 401k, then had me put in jail for hitting him with my van which i didn't do and also told them I dropped our 3 year old daughter off on the side and left her also didn't do and would never. I sat in jail for 3 days not knowing what was going to happen. The police told me I was being charged with felony domestic. I was terrified I had never been in jail in my life nor had I ever abused anyone. I was worried about my kids I have 5 total 4 before I got with him that I raised by myself then our daughter together. I was mostly worried about my 3 year old cause my other kids are teens and adults and my 3 year old had never been away from me for longer than one night. I had no way to get ahold of anyone cause I didnt know any numbers without having my phone. It was terrifying. Then on the fourth day they did a 4 hour investigation and came back and dropped all charges. They said the investigation proved there was no way I could have hit him with my van and had talked to witnesses who said they seen me hand my daughter to him and never seen me hit him with anything. I was so relieved but I knew I was done done with him. He had already cost me my house, my job, my money, now almost my freedom and my child. Not to mention several times I thought for sure he was going to kill me. He used to choke me til I woupd pass out and wake up not knowing where I was. Somedays O couldn't eat cause my throat was so sore that drinking water hurt. He had also stabbed me acted like he was going to drown me a few times and once headbutted me so hard that teo weeks later I got two black eyes. But usually it was choking he went to and it was horrible. He did this in front of our daughter often towards the end and she told me she wished she was a super hero so she could make her daddy stop cause she loved me and didnt want me to die. He had our child due to me being in jail and would not let me see her or get her because I no longer wanted to be with him. I went to the house where he was staying. He called the police. I told them he is not on the birth certificate nor had he signed paternity papers (he wasnt tere when she was born and didnt want to sign the papers after cause he didnt want to have to pay child support in case we broke up) so in the state of Illinois he had no rights to her at all. They told me I did not either and they would have dcfs take her into foster care if i would not let her stay with him. I left her there. I missed her birthday that we had a party planned and presents bought for. He did allow me 2 times to have her but after 2 days each time he came and got her while i was at work and then wouldnt let me have her again for weeks in between. He harrassed me and my family everyday. Sent nude pictures of me to my teenage daughters even. I figured he would get over the break up and stop and didnt want to get a order of protection myself cause i didn't want to keep my daughter from her father. The last time i got her she clung to me crying for hours telling me how much she missed me. I knew then that I had to get an OP. He came and got her while i was at work and my oldest daughter said my she screamed and cried she wanted to stay with her mommy and he told her she would never see her mommy again. He went and got an order of protection against me using the me hitting him with my van for reason even though that had been dropped. When the court date came i was ready for war. He called me and said he wasn't going to go that he wanted to handle things civily that she missed me and he didnt want her to be without her family. So I didnt go I was super excited that I was finally going to be able to see her. He went he and because I didn't he got a permanent OP he took pictures of it and Sent them. To say I was crushed doesn't cover it. I literally couldn't hear people talking. My kids are my world and she is the baby me and my other kids have spoiled her since she was born. She was always with me went everywhere with me and he didn't even like having her while I worked. He had 2 other kids that he doesnt ever see or pay for has a history of abuse and OPs from exes. He never participated in anything with her nmdidnt buy her Christmas presents or birthday presents didnt even care to watch her open them. And now I have to go get assessed for being a domestic abuser and he is telling people he had to take her cause I was being neglectful and was doing drugs and prostitution. All of which are absurd and most people know that thank goodness. But I  havent seen my daughter in 5 months. I have missed her bday, her first day of school, halloween, Christmas. His family has told me themselves that she has changed from a sweet fun polite full of life child to a quiet, depressed, sad, mean child. He has told her that I don't love her and don't want her anymore. I went to tell her that I do and of course went to jail for violating my car got impounded also and i couldnt afford to get it out so I lost it. I also didnt get to see her cause she wasn't there. Then he went and said I violated it another time which I had a warrant for. A friend had her friend a lawyer get that turned into a court date but he doesn't do family law so cant help me with her. And the DCFS stuff that was supposed to be dropped from when I went to jail the fisrt time wasn't but yhey never talked to me or my kids just to him and found me negligent. I appealed but the letter came to the address I was using and noone was home and the post office wouldnt let me have it with no ID which he stole. My life in the last year has completely changed in such a way I'm still amazed that anyone could be capable of crushing me this bad. I have a place to stay now so thats good butvthe depression sometimes immobilizes me. I've never dealt with anything like this I have always worked, was always happy, raised my kids myself, owned 3 houses, always had a car. Now I lay in bed for days at a time crying nothing makes me happy all my memories on facebook are of her, anything that happens reminds me of her. I just want my daughter back i miss her and she misses me. I have emailed and called organizations I just keep hitting walls. I cant use legal aid cause he is. Catholic charites had their legal department call me butvthey can't take it due to the order of protection which he shouldn't even have cause he has no legal rights to her but here I am not knowing where my baby is or if she is even ok. I just want her back and want her to know I love her and didnt leave her.",Mstycan,2019-01-18 14:55:21,4,1435,10.2,37.94,44.3,14.27,20.5,10.38,93.59,62.3,25.09,21.05,11.29,0.7,0,8.29,0.77,4.04,3.28,10.94,11.36,4.81,7.32,4.39,23,2.3,1.05,1.05,1.32,1.05,4.6,1.88,2.72,0.42,0.7,1.39,16.1,1.46,0.28,5.3,4.04,11.99,1.18,1.74,2.23,1.53,1.88,4.18,1.88,0.91,0.7,0.21,1.6,0.35,0.7,0.14,0.28,6.69,1.67,0.98,1.67,1.95,0.56,11.36,8.92,0.77,14.01,2.58,4.46,7.18,1.74,0.56,0.98,0.77,0.21,0.28,0.42,0,0.28,0.07,0,0,7.74,4.88,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.32,0.28,0
ahg4p9,"Almost a year after leaving seven years of abuse, the situation for my children and I is worst than ever, and I don't know what to do.","I've put off making a desperation post like this because my story reads like an exaggerated trope of domestic abuse, but I'm two months away from a DVRO hearing in which my ex/babymama intends to request a permanent RO which I believe will have devastating effects on my ability to regain at least joint custody with my children.

&amp;#x200B;

...two hours of deletions later...

&amp;#x200B;

Welp...I can't manage to get my story out, so here are the most pertinent detail: In April 2017, she attacked me and held me captive in our home for 45-60 minutes total.  I didn't respond physically, and she backed down as I started to call 911 which I unfortunately did not follow through with. Prior to that event are innumerable instances of her verbally/emotionally/psychologically abusing me in front of our children , as well as direct abuse against our children (already tried calling CWS, no help), not to mention 10 years of active bullemia, which at the worst I saw was 10x binge/purges a day.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to/can't bring myself more details, so I will make my request: I desperately need an attorney. ""Fighting"" in my case entails filing for IRS/social services fraud, bank fraud, and the claim that her entire DVRO/custody case is premised on intentionally false testimony. It entails making extreme claims of abuse that I may or may not be able to prove in court, but are necessary to making my case. I'm at a point where I can admit that I am completely stuck, and do not have the bandwith (of any kind) to fight anymore, and I'm terrified of proceeding with all of the legal/fraud processes necessary while there is still an RO in effect and I am disposed to fucking myself over in court. I asked the judge, point blank, if filing fraud reports would violate the RO, and she told me she couldn't give me legal advice...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in San Luis Obispo County, CA. I'm looking for any kind of help, whether it just be someone experienced that can talk me through what I need to do, that can help to find pro bono legal representation, or even take on the case themselves.

ahkdfa,Homesick and disoriented,"He moved us across the country a a couple of weeks back and I am starting to get very homesick and feeling bizarre. This is our 3rd move across state lines and our 8th move total in our decade together. 

The homesick part makes sense to me, As it’s just starting to set in that I won’t be able to see my friends and I don’t know anyone here. 

But the disorientation is really bad. I basically feel that I don’t have a “home”. I have feelings like I want to leave (he pulled a knife on me for “fun and as a joke” few weeks back) and is verbally putting me down again. But I also feel like I just don’t know where I would go if I left. 

I keep telling myself to “just get over it” and forgive him. But I had a realization recently that it’s not at all about forgiveness....it’s about trust. I can’t trust him not to pull knives, punch walls, choke me or whatever suits his mood. I don’t think I like unpredictability in a person. It’s hard to sleep at night and I just feel like my head is spinning.

I can’t decide where to go. I tried to go back to my hometown but another toxic family member attacked me and his wife, when i mentioned that I wanted to stay longer, this has happened before and is typical of this relative. He doesn’t like my close relationship with his wife. 

But it made me feel so unwelcomed that I hopped on a plane in the middle of the night.  Much as I had done a few weeks back to get some space from my husband! I do feel like I am bouncing back and forth between toxic relationships. 

I sometimes feel like I should just pick another city I have never l lived in and start 100% over. Sometimes I miss my friends and I want to go back to the previous city. Sometimes I want to stay put and just move away from him, as I like the climate in my current city. 

I have had difficulty determining “what I want in life”. During my childhood it was imprinted upon me that my wants/needs were not so important. I have always put others first, even when they are abusive and am well adapted to accommodating others. To the extent that I sometimes have trouble identifying when/if I want something or what is in my own best interest. 

I think if I could just decide and really “want” something then I could go for it. I need to have this as counter-leverage to the trauma bonds I have with him. I just don’t know how to orient myself to a goal. I am used to being told what to do, in every aspect.",explainthisplease111,2019-01-19 00:32:44,0,480,21.75,11.76,98.13,32.94,16,12.92,93.75,62.71,22.5,16.25,13.12,0.83,0,2.08,0.21,6.25,3.96,14.17,9.38,7.08,8.33,2.71,22.08,3.12,3.12,2.08,0.42,2.29,5.21,2.71,2.29,0,0.42,0.83,7.08,0.83,0.42,0.42,2.29,15.42,4.38,1.04,3.54,3.12,1.04,3.96,2.29,0.21,0,1.88,1.46,0.42,1.04,0,0,6.67,2.92,1.04,1.25,1.04,1.04,3.33,16.67,0.62,17.71,3.75,8.54,6.88,0.21,0.62,1.04,0,0,0,0.21,0,0,0,0.21,0,14.79,6.67,1.67,0,0,0,0.21,0.21,2.08,2.92,0.42,0.62
ahlz7p,"Feel awful after separating, is this normal?","Hi all, so I’m posting for a bit of support and to just unload, my partner of 10 months, whom i still love dearly was arrested a few nights ago. He assaulted me (many times in the past 6 months, everything from strangling me, throwing me about, pinning me against the wall, hitting my legs, ripping my hair out, throwing things at me). 

He told me the only way he would ever leave the house was if he was arrested, so the evening before my daughters 2nd birthday when he tried to push me down the stairs and dragged me across the hallway by my hair I decided it was enough... but I don’t feel happy? I miss him so much, when we were not arguing it was AMAZING, he made me the happiest I’ve ever been when things were good. I retracted my statement and he was released on bail, he cannot contact me until they decide whether to prosecute him. I just feel so sad, because it ended this way, I’m sad that he had to do those things to me, why couldn’t he just stop after the first time? Then we’d be happy.

ahmsxi,Mother may return to an abusive relationship-- HELP!,"Some backstory... Please excuse the wall of text but I feel like I need to give the full story so that people can give me some help. I want advice, I really do not want my mom to fall back into this abusive relationship!  


This past year my mother got into a relationship with a guy from work. She showed me pictures of how in shape and attractive he was, and I was happy that she finally found a good-looking guy. Finally we were going to meet him and I can say with confidence I got a bad vibe right away (so did ALL of her friends). I remained pleasant but he seemed sneaky, judgemental, and secretive. He would whisper things to my mom while we were all in the room, wouldn't engage in conversation with us. You couldn't have a conversation without them clearly tuning you out and making weird eye contact with each other, touching each other.. All kinds of weird stuff like that. When they would stay here with us, they would never leave the basement, and my mom wouldn't even talk to me for days! When I did see them it would be right before they went to the pub to get wasted (my mom quit drinking before this due to alcoholic tendencies, why was she reverting?) I found, whenever he was around, if I tried to talk to her she would brush me off to immediately engage with him instead. I tried talking to her about how I felt but she became immediately defensive about him and I felt completely shut down. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was getting totally freaked out, as it felt like this man was completely controlling her! This is not my mother! As a defence mechanism for my rejection I felt from her I completely isolated myself. I became cold towards her. She would only come to me to talk if they were fighting, which was my first TRUE red flag. He was gaslighting her, making up fake stories of things she allegedly did to make her feel guilt. He would go through her phone, and read texts from her previous relationships, and get angry. Then he would make up lies that she was secretly still talking to these people, which she wasn't, because I went through every deleted text-message retrieval resource out there trying to find these messages that didn't exist. He would bring this up like clockwork, typical abuse scenario. He freaks out over this non-issue, my mom threatens to leave, he showers her with gifts and affection, makes her feel bad for him, and she returns. And he flips moods at the drop of a hat, so I suspect mental illness is probably at play here too. My mom said he was just ""hangry"" and needed to eat and I knew this was grade-A bullshit. (As a side note, he is also incredibly abusive and manipulative to customer service workers, so it seems his abusive tendencies transcend his romantic relationships) At the time I didn't know this much, so I was still just getting really bad feelings about him. My mom was constantly moody with me, she began micromanaging the cleanliness in our house because he was so judgemental. This ended up falling on me and my boyfriend being constantly berated about... Everything. I did everything to appease her to lessen the anxiety in my household. Again, very unlike her. All this stuff went on for months. I came to hate her, and I wanted to go full no-contact with her. My boyfriend and I finally found an apartment, and just as I was getting ready to put in my application, my mom came home for my brother's birthday. The blood vessel in her eye was broken. My brother and I immediately got our backs up because we knew EXACTLY how it happened. My brother asked, she said ""I don't know"". I immediately get mad, but I hold it in because I don't have PROOF yet. She leaves to go back to his house for a few days, and comes home. She tells me everything.

&amp;#x200B;

He smacked her across the face to wake her up-- that's how the vessel broke. He'd also poured cold water over her while she slept. ""To make her feel the embarrassment he felt"" as he allegedly felt the night before when they went out for drinks with some friends-- he claimed she was coming onto one of the other guys there (she texted one of the girls they were out with, she said that definitely didn't happen). He choked her. My mom ran away, got in her car and began driving. He ran her down on the highway, screaming at her. She was finally able to escape and get home. I immediately forgave my mom for everything, as it was clear the way she was treating me was just reflective of the abuse she was enduring. I started sending her resources for abuse victims as she didn't seem to understand that she was a victim of domestic abuse. She kept correcting me when I would emphasize that he hit her-- ""he just slapped me"".. It was very difficult for her to acknowledge but she eventually did. He would call her non-stop, 40+ times a day. When she blocked his number, he would e-mail excessively. She would not engage, and the one time she did, was to reinforce that he was abusive and to stop contacting. I helped her get a new cell-phone/number. Then I helped her book a getaway in Costa Rica at a meditation retreat to relax and unwind and take care of herself.

&amp;#x200B;

CURRENTLY.

&amp;#x200B;

She came home from Costa Rica-- it was a great trip. However, she told me she was in contact with abuser. She told me he said he was willing to go to couples counselling. I scoffed and said ""well wouldn't that be convenient for him?"" and she said, rather harshly ""well it would kind of be convenient for me too. There were a lot of good things about our relationship and if he's willing to fix it... Whatever, it doesn't mean I'm going to."" But I immediately saw red. I wanted to berate her, but I didn't. I wanted to tell her she was being an idiot, but I didn't. I know this is how abuse works. She mentioned multiple times that she felt ""bad"" for him after they broke up, because he was alone for Christmas and New Years. She even said ""she was abusive too"" because she retaliated and would say mean things to him back when he began verbally abusing her. It is hard to make her understand that she is not at fault here. Now she's left for the weekend, apparently at one of her girlfriends, but when I called she seemed to be sketchy on the phone again. I am scared she went to see him. All the research I've done says that it is very unlikely for abusers to change, and couple's counselling is NOT the way to do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need help, I need resources. She can't go back. I can't abandon her if she does, but I also can't tolerate the way she mistreats me because of him. Any experience, advice, etc is so appreciated. If you read this far, thank you... I'm desperate to help my mom!",TARRMIGAN,2019-01-19 07:07:31,5,1251,22.05,78.1,12.13,4.58,15.26,16.07,92.97,60.83,24.06,19.34,7.35,0.64,0.32,10.31,0.72,4.72,3.6,13.35,8.31,7.11,7.19,2,19.58,3.52,1.2,1.36,0.48,1.28,6,1.84,3.92,0.48,1.68,0.48,19.74,1.36,0.88,7.91,4.32,13.03,2.96,1.84,2.72,1.6,1.84,3.28,3.52,0.88,1.2,1.36,1.04,0.48,0.24,0,0.4,6.95,2.64,0.8,1.84,1.52,0.8,9.35,7.67,0.56,13.43,2.8,5.36,5.68,1.28,0.8,0.88,0.08,0.16,0,0.48,0.32,0,0,0.16,0,19.1,6.71,4.56,0,0.8,0.16,0.48,1.44,1.28,2.08,0.64,0.96
ahq2pn,Rant: Boyfriend verbally abusive because I won't share my medicine.,"This is just a rant to get it off my chest.

Abusive SO spent the last week ruining the vacation I paid for by explosive outbursts, shouting matches, hitting me, and threatening to leave me stranded in another country on a daily basis.

We got home in one piece and then he starts going off because I asked him to wash his hands before cuddling with me. Apparently I insulted his hygiene. He storms out, doesn't come home till 4am where he pretends everything is normal but sleeps on the floor RIGHT NEXT TO THE BED like that's a statement or something.

He wakes up today. Tells me I'm not allowed to go to the event I wanted, and then proceeds to tell me he's taking my inhaler because he didn't order his and he has to go to work. I ask him not to put that on me because I don't need to feel guilty and like it my fault if he has an asthma attack and I say no.

When I tell him I need my inhaler he proceeds to full on shout at me, tell me I'm a useless bitch and that he hates me. I'm selfish, he would have done the same for me.

Like yeah. Maybe he would have let me take his inhaler. But he has a car and I'm stuck at home. If I need it I would either have to wait 20 minutes for a lyft to take me to urgent care or call an ambulance.

I just hate that he's putting the stress on me. If anything happens to him I'll feel guilt for not letting him take it, but its so unfair of him to not refill his own inhaler and then try and guilt trip me into giving him mine.",HollyGeee,2019-01-19 12:46:58,4,311,26.88,24.96,53.62,1,18.29,13.83,93.89,61.74,25.4,20.9,12.22,0.32,0,8.36,0,4.5,4.82,13.83,8.04,2.57,9.32,2.89,20.26,2.89,1.93,0.64,0.64,0.96,6.43,0.96,5.47,1.61,2.57,0.64,12.86,0,0.32,0,8.68,11.9,1.29,1.93,3.22,3.22,0.32,4.5,1.93,0,0.96,0.96,3.22,2.25,0.96,0,0,6.11,1.29,0.64,1.93,1.93,0.64,2.57,15.43,1.93,15.11,2.89,6.43,5.47,0.32,0.32,1.29,0.64,0,0,0.64,0.32,0,0.32,0,0,12.22,5.47,2.57,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,3.86,0,0

ahyjdk,Trouble getting past previous violent episodes,"Although nothing physical has occurred in about 5 years, I still have trouble getting over two specific times my husband assaulted me. At the time of the assaults, I was not able to leave him, and he wouldn’t go. So I stayed. 

We have tried talking about it, and he thinks that since he hasn’t pushed or hit me in years, that I should understand that it’s not going to happen again. But he still raises his voice at me, and I’m always expecting that another violent episode is just around the corner. I’m careful to only approach him about something when I judge that his mood is suitable for whatever I need to talk to him about. But I feel like I’m tiptoeing around him all the time and am very guarded when we are together. 

I know that no one here knows him personally, so there’s no way to guess whether something will happen again. But I’m wondering if anyone has been through something like this and the abusive person has actually changed?  I can’t tell if I’m crazy for staying or not. We have been married for 15 years. I knew that he had a bad temper before we got married, and sometimes I hate that I went ahead with it anyway. I left him once, but he promised things would get better (this was before any physical violence occurred), but he swore he had realized his mistakes and would stop. It probably did stop for a while. 

All I know is that I’m anxious when he’s in the house. I do everything to avoid upsetting him.  And I feel awful because he’s not always behaving badly, and he can be a very good father. And now I’m so hyper-vigilant about his moods and about how he speaks (raised voice or not), I feel assaulted whenever he’s a little upset. He thinks I don’t need to feel this way. I know normal people argue. But I feel paralyzed every time he gets upset about something. It’s like when you get a shock from a particular outlet one time, and then every time you need to use it, you feel like you need to protect yourself first, even if the problem was supposedly fixed. 

Has anyone out there been in this situation before?

ai094z,I think my upstairs neighbor is physically abusing his girlfriend. Need advice on how to proceed.,"Title pretty much says it all. It’s taking every fiber of my being not to storm up there right now and knock on the door. 

High level, I live in a little townhouse-style fourplex in the city. The building dates back to the thirties, so the walls are more or less paper thin- same can be said of the ceiling. Two tenants occupy the room above mine- a guy in his mid-thirties and a gal in her mid-twenties. They’re a couple- have had a handful of perfectly normal interactions with them, which means nothing, I know. Still having a hard time squaring exactly what the hell is going on up there. 

Over the course of the last four months, on five separate occasions, I’ve woken up to the sound of what I originally thought was them “rearranging furniture” in the apartment. Squeaking, banging, loud, large thuds. Then I could hear his voice- he yells. Loud. Not while the banging/thudding is going on, but in the before/after. After the third time, it finally dawned on me what this could mean. 

This morning was the worst one I’ve heard, and finally cemented for me what’s going on. At maybe 6:30 AM, I woke up to this pacing sound (*slam, slam, slam, slam*) upstairs. About thirty minutes later, I hear the front door open- the girlfriend enters the apartment. I can finally make out the conversation for once- he asks her why she didn’t call him. The “furniture rearranging” starts- I’m half awake in my tiny-ass little IKEA twin bed and without even thinking I shout through the ceiling, “IS EVERYTHING OKAY UP THERE?”

Guy’s voice: “NO!”

Me: “DO YOU NEED SOME HELP?”

Guy’s voice: “NO!”

They were quiet for maybe an hour and a half. Now he’s back at it with a vengeance. I’m so guilty and concerned that I made this even worse for her. 

I don’t know the woman personally- I’ve tried to get to know her, but she keeps to herself, and I don’t want to be “that person”. How can I be an ally to her in a way that doesn’t put her in danger?",daringitlog,2019-01-20 09:50:05,12,380,65.79,48.95,85.58,11.97,13.57,13.68,92.63,56.32,16.32,11.84,6.58,0,0.26,4.21,0.79,4.47,8.95,13.95,9.21,5.79,4.21,2.63,17.37,4.74,2.37,2.11,3.95,1.84,2.89,0.79,1.84,0.26,0.79,0,11.32,0,1.84,2.89,2.63,10,2.63,1.32,1.32,1.32,1.58,2.11,4.47,0,3.95,0.53,0.79,0.26,0.53,0,0,6.32,1.84,0.53,2.89,0.79,0.79,2.89,13.16,1.05,21.58,1.32,13.68,7.11,1.05,0,2.63,0,0.26,0,0.79,0.53,0,0.26,0,0,26.05,6.05,5.26,1.05,0,0.79,0.53,3.16,3.68,3.95,0.53,1.05

ai1wtf,When's the right time to tell someone about domestic abuse?,"My dad's been abusing my mom for years (mostly mentally, but sometimes physically). She regularly black outs/sleepwalks do to being mentally drained from all his screaming and yelling at her. I used to not want to butt in and defend her unless he hit her (because I didn't want to escalate the situation) but he's not stopping and he's not changing, so I'm gonna start fighting back even if he's just yelling. I want to tell someone outside of the family for help, but I don't know when I should do it. Just about 30mins ago he was yelling at her and he hit her with a metal spoon and her nose started bleeding. She's currently sleeping in my room. I want to tell my moms parents (they live downstairs). But I'm not sure if i should wait a few more days until he's cooled down, or if i should do it now when he's mad. Also, I don't have much evidence of his abuse over the years. And i'm thinking of getting my little brothers to tell their teaches that their dad's yells at and sometimes hits their mom.

TL:DR: My dad's abused my mom for years, i want to tell my mom's parents who live downstairs.

ai62t4,The clock is running.,"I’m sitting here tonight, and I’m thinking back on every opportunity I had to get out before I was in too deep.  How you lied about who you were for attention you already had, and everything that followed:

The first time you crumpled me at a kickback and left me sobbing on the floor of your dorm room to go take shots with someone you were eyeing for affection. I remember hiding the bottles and making excuses for the ways you wouldn’t change. How you used to make me feel, how you built me up and the way you’d brag to your friends about our most private moments without my consent or concern for my privacy. When I questioned you and you’d smack me across the face, or sock me in the jaw, and how I’d try to restrain you to no avail. The way you broke me down for my weight, for my hair, for the things I couldn’t change and that you didn’t appreciate. How, in spite of your flaws, and for our friendship I loved and looked out for you. The way you would call me crazy, and make me question my sanity for feeling as though you’d found someone else. How I stood aside once you announced them, and the way you drew me in and threw me out with the violent tide of your indecisiveness. When I told the police you were fine after a friend 5150’d you, and the fear I felt when you told me later you were going to lock the children in the bathroom and off yourself. The pain I felt as I looked in my child’s face for the last time knowing they’d never be mine again. How you weaponized our child against me. How you flaunted your paramour, and how I continue to be the bigger person. 

Once someone has broken you down to your base elements through force, and fear, and love, they always have that power of you. But, not a day goes by that I don’t recognize that I’m still that young boy, crumpled up in the corner of your dorm room sobbing, the illusion shattered, with a red cheek and broken heart. 

I’m a big guy who was physically and emotionally abused, and I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD over a relationship that only further outlines my inadequacy as a man. Some days I’m just okay, but most days I’m just in a panic and covered with coulda, woulda, shoulda and what ifs. 

I just wanted to vent, because I never have and I feel like younger guys need to know they aren’t alone and that it’s okay to be the one that leaves, and that I wish I had.",DrawnShade,2019-01-20 19:48:26,4,459,29.37,79,93.9,6.42,24.16,13.94,91.5,62.31,23.53,19.39,10.24,0.65,7.63,0,0.87,4.14,6.75,14.38,7.84,5.88,10.24,2.18,16.34,4.58,2.61,3.27,1.09,0.87,5.23,1.74,3.49,1.09,1.09,1.09,14.6,0,0.87,0,0.87,13.94,3.49,3.7,1.53,2.61,1.09,2.4,2.4,0.87,0,1.53,2.61,1.31,0.65,0,0.22,6.32,1.74,0.87,2.83,0.65,0.44,6.32,6.32,0.65,15.69,1.96,7.84,6.1,0.87,0.44,1.09,0,0,0,0.44,0,0,0.44,0,0,14.38,4.14,5.66,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,4.36,0,0
ai6qex,Trigger broke me after a year of being ok,"Watching true detective and Matthew McConaughey's character has some personality qualities that my ex has. I've been doing fine with this season so far...up until some hard drug use scenes. Drug use is a trigger for me for not only my ex, but also for my step father. My step father was a drug addict and he died of overdose my freshman year of high school. He was my best friend. 
My father figure, my real dad and I hadn't had a great relationship. Now the trigger with my ex. He was also an addict. He used to always think he could get high and I wouldn't notice. He mistook me for a fool, a goody good who couldn't tell the difference. He didn't listen when I told him my experiences of dealing with my step father's addiction. 
When I found out I was pregnant, I thought he would come to his senses. I was wrong. I was two months into my pregnancy when I found out he was using again. I had suspicions, but it was always better if I kept my mouth shut. I found out through his cousin. His cousin, who called me at 2am asking about my ex's whereabouts. See, he was supposed to go to his cousins at midnight to get some Adderall from him. 
He never showed. So now I was up and tripping. His car was in the parking lot of our apartment complex. My car was there. The TV was on. He was nowhere to be seen. I went down to look for him. Turns out he never made it past getting into his car. There he was. Driver's seat. Passed out. Keys in his hand. Beer in his lap. Passed out. And what did I get for waking him and being upset? I got scolded. 
'Get the fuck out of my face you stupid bitch' and 'im not on anything quit trippin'. But he was. A pint of liquor. 6 pack of beer and 4 xanax with every intention to go get some ""Adderall"". The truth I came to find out was that he was getting meth from his cousin and claiming to be selling it but was actually just using it. 'I'm selling to get extra money for the baby, you're always bitching about money. I gotta test the product. I don't have a problem. At least I'm not sticking needles in my arm like your step dad.' 
Seeing even glimpses of those scenes of meth and cocaine use just brought all that heart break, disappointment and helplessness flooding back. My point in sharing this is that healing is a long process. With my ex it has been a little over a year. My step dad though, it's been 11 years. 11 years. Just when you think you are fine something triggers those memories and those awful feelings. Those emotions that you can feel deep into your gut. 
But.....you push forward. Even when you get set back. This process is not for the weak and I know that now. I can't be strong all the time though and moments when I break feel discouraging. I hate this feeling. I hate remembering. These moments just fucking suck. Sorry this was so long.

ai7iwj,How to help my friend...,"I have a friend in Wheeling WV who needs her husband out of her life. They’ve been married for about three years they have a child that just turned one and she has a child from a previous relationship her husband is verbally and mentally and emotionally abusive she refuses to get a divorce when she wants one. But yet he continually complains about the relationship the lack of intimacy how she won’t give him attention but yet she’s done giving him attention because of the way he treats her. Her mom owns the house she lives and she pays rent to her mom his name is not my lease so I know at least she has the upper hand but he’s just refusing to go then refusing to fight her for visitation of her son and quite frankly he doesn’t even take care of the child around the house with her around how would he take care of the child alone. Literally she’ll have to ask him repeatedly to change her diaper then he makes a big to do about it and complains nonstop he only ever picks up the child or ask like a dad when family or friends are around to put on a good show. Further frustrating as her mom and sister are constantly yelling at her demanding that she not leave the relationship because her mom had a divorce I was a single parent and doesn’t want that life for her her mom knows the sky is abusive and doesn’t seem to care she keeps threatening to fight her for custody of the children if she leaves her husband. Also wearing is that her husband works as a coalminer as the sole provider for the family with the exception of her part-time job where she works tonight overnight a week unfortunately there’s no more availability to pick up more shifts there and due to not having the right babysitting she can’t pick up any other work so she’s concerned if she leaves him she won’t be able to pay rent and bills. She feels like he’s backed her into a corner, He is very two faced. He literally works comes home and sleeps or watches tv. He doesn’t pick up around the home take out trash ect. If she asks him to help do things like car seats he avoids doing it for weeks. He won’t even go out and get food. He says she does nothing all day she should do it. But yet she has a very active 1 year old. Tonight as I was talking to her she told me to message no more and he took her phone from her I have not heard from her in over a hour I’m concerned.

ai8qzr,Could use some advice,"I am a survivor of an abusive relationship and could use some guidance on how to handle a similar situation with my sister. She recently had a child with her on again/off again boyfriend. He has been physically and emotionally abusive for the past 6 years. 

Last year she got an order of protection against him and it's still current. He had been stalking her during their time apart, showing up ""coincidentally"", and next thing I know she's pregnant. She decided to keep the baby and let him move back in with her. Things appeared to be on the mend between the two until about a month ago. 

She revealed to me that during an argument he had forcibly grabbed the child from her arms, placed it in the bassinet, and then proceeded to choke her and somehow busted her lip. 

TLDR: My sister's boyfriend is still abusing her and I am conflicted as to what I should do. As an educator, I'm obligated to report any abuse or neglect. I've tried talking with her but she still has hope that he'll change. I'm all for 2nd chances, but you can count on at least 3 hands the number of times he's physically abused get in the past 6 years. I understand I can't change her mind, but i'm worried about the baby, too. Any thoughts or advice is much appreciated!!!",OpheliaCox69,2019-01-21 02:05:10,4,236,55.34,76.43,29.66,2.77,15.73,17.8,91.1,58.47,18.22,15.25,5.51,0,0.42,8.9,0.42,2.97,7.2,15.25,10.59,4.66,7.63,0.42,16.53,2.97,2.12,0.85,1.69,2.97,4.24,0.85,3.39,0.42,2.54,0.42,16.1,2.12,0.85,7.2,3.81,12.71,2.54,2.12,1.69,3.81,0.42,3.39,2.12,1.27,0,0.85,2.97,1.27,1.69,0.42,0,5.93,2.12,0.85,1.69,0.85,0.42,5.51,11.02,1.27,16.95,1.27,5.51,10.17,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,0.42,0,0.42,0,0,0,16.1,5.51,3.39,0.42,0,0,1.27,0,0.85,4.24,0,0.42

aic0ln,"Living with an abusive brother, feeling awful and looking for advice to help me until I can move out","Following a recent psych appointment, I've been given a PTSD diagnosis as a result of years living with my abusive brother. This psych is also the second one to point out that I've been living with domestic violence. To say the least, this has rocked me a little and I've been struggling to come to terms with both revelations. 

I'm currently 24 and my brother is 20. He is about 6ft tall, solidly built and a very loud, angry and aggressive person. I'm only 5'2"" and quite thin, so he is significantly bigger and stronger than me. We currently live at home with both of our parents and neither of us are currently in a financially stable position to move out. 

Living with him is like constantly walking on egg shells. He lords it over the house, is very entitled, and has belittled and mocked me and my interests for years. As children, he has pulled a knife on me and has chased me down with a cricket bat. He has never followed through with any injuries from this, but the moments stand out very clear to me in my otherwise fuzzy childhood. He has explicitly told me that he hates my mother and believes that I am the favourite child. He continues to hold grudges over petty matters that happened in childhood and nothing anyone does in the house is ever good enough for him. We can only eat certain meals that he likes and pre-approves or he will throw tantrums. He needs to know what everyone is doing at all times. We need his permission to do things in our own (shared) house so we don't disrupt him. His convenience is more important than my near-crippling anxiety and panic attacks. He likes to scare and bully people because it's ""funny"" to him, as are our reactions when we get mad, and never once in my life have I heard him apologise for anything. My parents did not take him to therapy as a child, never followed through with punishment and, now that he is an adult, they continue to believe that ""everything is fine"" because, once he moves out, he'll no longer be their problem.

I'm currently at a loss and constantly on edge. My parents continue to ignore what he is doing and refuse to listen to me or take my advice on everything from going to therapy individually or as a family, taking a firmer stance (maybe they're scared too?), or spending more time with him in case he is feeling unloved in the family. Because of this, I am beginning to resent them, which is not something I want to be feeling. I am scared that one day his anger or a fight between him and my family may turn violent. Domestic violence statistics are high in Australia and, recently, there have been a few instances in my state where families have been murdered by abusive family members. Recent fights in my house have resulted in him punching walls and fracturing his hand, things thrown and broken, and Mum in a serious, borderline self-harming panic attack. Things are bad and no one seems to want to acknowledge or address it.

I'm planning on moving out as soon as possible to take care of myself and heal, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice for dealing with my brother until that time comes, so I can get out safely and go non-contact as soon as possible.  I have friends who can offer rooms and places that I can escape to if need be, but I don't want to become a permanent burden on them like that. Currently, I just feel so constantly belittled, shamed, mocked and anxious. I'm just exhausted and need some ways to cope and survive so I can reach that light at the end of the tunnel.",cobaltbug,2019-01-21 08:56:59,4,670,40.47,66.21,51.29,1,21.61,18.06,93.58,58.51,17.91,12.99,6.72,1.34,0,4.33,0.6,4.93,4.03,15.52,10.15,4.33,9.85,1.64,18.66,5.82,3.43,0.9,1.49,1.49,8.51,2.24,6.27,1.34,3.13,0.15,13.73,2.09,0.3,0.3,5.07,10.45,1.94,0.9,1.49,3.58,1.79,2.54,2.09,0.45,0.6,0.9,2.39,0.3,1.79,0,0.45,8.96,3.73,0.45,3.28,1.04,0.75,2.69,14.93,1.04,15.82,2.54,7.46,5.82,0.45,0.9,2.09,0.3,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.43,4.48,4.78,0,0,0.15,0,0.6,0.75,2.09,0.6,0

2 1/2 weeks of non stop texting, asking about the baby, and calling me before bed telling me that everything will be okay and that he will always be here for me and the baby and that he will never leave.

Then, today i had a dream, that we were in the same house, and whenever we’re in the same
Room he’d disappear.

I woke up and i just had this gut feeling that he was talking to someone so I messaged him “i’m awake” to which he said “what did i do now?” I said “Nothing but why do i have this gut feeling that we’re just temporary and you’re talking to somebody behind my back” he then accused me of having access to his socials (Which i no longer do since he changed his passwords the day I left, he gave me his accounts because he didnt let me use my own and had me delete them) and the called me PSYCHO, CREEP.  Admitted to sending a message then denying it when i asked “So you are talking to someone” 

He denied that he sent a message to someone then proceeded to tell me that i need psychiatric help and that I’m obsessed with him. When just 3 days ago he said “I don’t want to lose you again” 


Half an hour later he texted “Eat well” to which I replied “K” then he said “Don’t reply to me with your boring ass answers I don’t have time
For that” so I said “Then stop calling me names” then he proceeded to tell me “Then stop acting like a psycho” it ended with insults “U need friends, are you bored?” Then after about an hour he texts “Hello” i left it on read.

aidom3,Abusive ex's mom passed away. And now I'm getting all this anxiety and anger from our past relationship back.,"I guess I'll start with a little background.
My ex and I dated for about 3 years. In those 3 years he was mentally, verbally and physically abusive. I chose to stay  because I was hopeful things would get better. It wasnt till last May where I ended things. I originally chose to end it because he didnt want to get a job. But it was after we broke up that I started to just think about how bad our relationship was. How much of a toxic person he was and the ugly person it made me as well. I chose to cut all contact with him since then. Not before he chose to confess to me that he pretty much was cheating on me with his current girlfriend for the last year of our relationship. At first I was like ""fine, whatever leave me alone!"" But it didnt sink in till a few weeks later. But I managed to get over it and just not really think about him anymore.
Thing is I have kept in contact with his family. I was really close with his mom and sisters. I never asked about him just like they never talked about him to me. They agreed with my decision to end things with him. They loved me as much as I loved them. 

This past week, his mom passed away from cancer and it really hurt me. She was like a second mom to me! I loved her very much. So I went to visit the family yesterday to give my condolences.  On the drive there I was getting anxiety because I havent seen him since we broke up. I wasnt sure if he was going to lash out at me from grief or if his girlfriend would be there. But both of them never showed up. So that was a relief. But I realized on the way back home, that just being in that house where he and I used to live brought back too many memories. And so much anger and resentment I have towards him. And just all the hurt I've been carrying for more than half a year.
Her funeral service will be this weekend and I was planning on attending, I know for a fact that my ex and I will be running into each other there. Now I've been debating if it's best if I do or dont show up?
I guess I was just wondering of anyone else has felt the same thing?

ail3zg,11 months out and still having nightmares,"Hey there,

So I've been away from my violent ex for eleven months now. It's been a crazy year. Started my life over from scratch. Got full custody of my daughter. Got a protective order. Relocated, changed my named, saw a therapist, began taking self defense classes, etc. I'm recovering and I'm happy and I feel so incredibly lucky. 

The thing is, I'm still having nightmares....which is why I'm up in the middle of the night on Reddit. I still wake up with jaw and fists clenched, body rigid and thrashing. I took apart my bed frame and sleep on a mattress on the floor because I was falling off regularly. 

I know this is a normal part of the healing process, but it's getting difficult to fall asleep, no matter how tired I am, because I know what I'll be facing once I do fall asleep. I'm not taking sleeping pills because my daughter is very young and I need to be able to wake up quickly. 

I guess there's no real solution except to just give it time. Hoping for some encouragement or advice from folks who have been through this before.

ainmav,Boyfriend was on Xanax and sleeping pills and said I pushed him off a deck! Now he remembers he fell but I already got charged with assault!,"Please advise. This is one holy mess. 2 weeks before Christmas we got in a fight. I threw brownies at him and threw a glass at the wall. I left the apartment but he had apparently already called the cops. I was arrested 2 blocks away. Then Jan.4 we were scheduled to go see a couples counselor that evening. I guess he was freaking out about what would come up. He thought I was only going to tell him I was leaving him. So he took his Xanax and a handful of sleeping pills. Hes done this before so I left. I knew he would only get weird angry etc so afraid of another incident, I left. I planned on getting a hotel room but forgot my drivers license. So I went back to the apt. He had blocked the door or so I thought so I pounded on the door ( a neighbor heard me yelling "" open the fucking door "" I got in, my key may have been stuck. I see him covered with barf. Hed throw n up in bed. I had left the door open because my chihuahua was still out there. He walked outside and the next thing I knew he was laying at the bottom of the stairs. He saw me above him and in his drug induced fog thought I pushed him. They arrested me for misdemeanor assault even though I sat there for 15 minutes telling them he was suicidal that morning. I got out 5 days later on a 10,000.00 bond. Still had a job thank God so I just went to work and thats all I've been doing. Today is a hearing. My public defender says they are pushing for a conviction and another lawyer I called said they brought up the 1st assault so theres 2 now. I have a conviction for one in 2006. And I have a involuntary manslaughter charge out of California in 2000. I know that sounds bad. I was living with a rich boyfriend in Hollywood. Hes Melanie Griffiths half brother through marriage. The cops said they were making an example out of us. A girl we were partying with overdosed in our guest house. I told the cops I had bought the drugs. I've been clean ever since and own a business and work with kids now. I have a non profit that gives instruments to kids. 100% turn around from my selfish life. I have a great support system. My family is big and totally supports me. I help many friends in recovery. But that case follows me to this day. No matter if something is not my fault- it's all they see. Now my boyfriend wrote a letter saying hes sorry and he fell but they are not seeming to believe him. What does it make any sense to me is that if a person is impaired on pills or alcohol or whatever and they commit a crime like let's just say a DUI then that's what they focus on the impairment of that person so even though he was the alleged victim how come they're not realizing that he was impaired people on sleeping pills do all kinds of crazy stuff don't get me started on Xanax so he's telling my family and he even wrote the email to my attorney and to the prosecutor saying that's not what happened I'm very sorry I saw her when I looked up I thought she push me I woke up in the hospital realizing that I fell but they're still pushing for a conviction.

aio3t3,My (16f) story of a long-distance abusive relationship,"hi this story is really long. im sorry. also, forgive me if i repeat certain points. this is just a massive brain dump for me and i have a serious memory issue.

my name is odie (oh-dee)

wow.

where the hell do i even start? i guess i'll give a little background.

we started dating october 13, 2017. he lived all the way in bournemouth, uk, and i live in texas. he WAS a professional soccer player although he wasn't on the first team (he was on the youth team.) a boy i fell in love with. he had many many many issues. awful childhood, moved from house to house, dad died, brothers were dicks to him, etc. he was very unstable, but i did my very best to always be there for him when he needed me to be. he didn't eat much, got very little sleep. 5 hours of sleep max.

i became obsessive, and so did he, but of course i was so blinded by love, i didn't realize how unhealthy it was. we began talking 24/7. LITERALLY. we slept on the phone, i woke up for school the next morning, we'd talk while i was getting ready, i'd go to school, text him ALLLL day, went to cheer practice, came home, called him, repeat. this went on for almost a year. but then i noticed changes in his mood and attitude towards me. he became very short tempered. always yelling at me for small things like turning the mic off when he was sleeping because i didnt want to bother him (because he never gets sleep.) and then i noticed that he hasn't been leaving the house. so i asked him about soccer. he told me that he was fired for being injured and showing up to practice late or tired. (i later found out that he lied to me about that. what actually happened was he started showing up to practices extremely tired and wasn't giving his best effort. his coach asked him about it and he told him that he had ""met a girl in texas."" his coach basically told him he was going to have to choose between soccer and i. he chose soccer. and i have always hated his ass for it. after we split, he would blame me for it. that i ""ruined his career."" and shit.)

he became manipulative. but i thought it was cute that he was protective.

he didn't like my mom. at first he did. but then she heard me masturbating on the phone with him (i'm not going to lie- im here to get feedback and advice. might as well start with honesty) around our six months. after that, she couldn't trust us to be alone. we weren't allowed to sleep on the phone or even talk for as long as we used to be able to. and that pissed him the fuck off.

i love my mom. she just wants me to be appropriate and make good decisions. i respect her and always will respect my mother. she busts her ass for me to be healthy and successful, and i am so grateful.she always wants me to be better than her. she lost her virginity at 15. and she wishes she hasn't. i never considered her being a parent (and her discipline style) as abusive or controlling. but my boyfriend thought otherwise.

he started making me feel like shit daily. he would tell me that my mom is controlling and abusive. i didn't want to believe it. but he would always get so angry at me. and i hate when people get angry at me and yell. it makes me extremely upset, and he knew that from the very beginning.

he would tell me constantly that i needed to be more assertive and aggressive and that i shouldn't let her yell at me and control my life like that. he would get angry when i told him i didn't want to do it because

1. i knew i'd get my ass beat and ytf would i want to get myself in trouble ??
2. i wouldn't be allowed to talk to him anymore
3. it would hurt me to treat my mom that way because she is my mother and i respect her

and one day, it did happen. beginning of september.

i felt like if i didn't say something, i would lose my relationship. and i didn't want that. but i also knew that i was ruining the relationship with my mother as well, and the trust she has with me.

i walked in her room and told her she wasn't going to control my life. anddddd it led to a whole ass argument and ended with me walking to school and her begging me, yelling at me to get into her car (this was all before i had to go to school. and dw, i didn't have to walk far. the school is behind my house across the highway.)

later that night i ended up calling him and trash talking him in front of my mom lol and he tries to EXPOSE ME BECAUSE HE KNOWS MY MOM IS RIGHT THERE. so he talks about how gOdlY i act and how i talk shit about my mum all the time and etc. i end up hanging up.

okay so fast forward- i get my door taken off, my mom and step-dad take a 4 week break (this will be relevant later), no phone, no anything. my mom convinces me for a short period of time that he is toxic blah bla blah yeah.

well THAT DIDN'T WORK.

the moral of the story is, mother knows best. ALWAYS. please believe me this time.

i talked to him again. and we kept our relationship a secret.

i found out soon after that he had attempted suicide by taking pills and was in the hospital.

i started talking to him while he was in the hospital, mid-sept. and we talked up until oct.31.

he was discharged from the hospital early to mid october.

during that time, we were off and on. he was angry at me because i turned on him and shit talked him the night i blew up on my mom. because he said i betrayed him. which, i did. and i take responsibility for that completely. it was wrong of me. but also, i felt so pressured and i felt like what he was telling me to do was my only option to save that relationship.

our secret relationship was god awful. he would bring up many many things that happened in the past. such as betraying him (mom situation), talking to other guys on my snapchat (we weren't officially dating. we were just flirting with eachother and i didn't even consider it to be serious), and also saying how i lied saying i never sent pictures before. ok i didn't tho. i only ever sent nudes to him, but what the fuck ever. he always stretched situations because he was addicted to conflict because he didn't have anything better to do because he didn't have a job.

because we were on and off mid-sept - oct 31, i went to homecoming with another boy. it wasn't very serious. he asked me to homecoming and i said yes. i lowkey wanted to distract all negative thoughts because i wanted to have at least one night that i could relax and have fun. it wasn't a romantic night. it was fun. i didn't have to worry about where my boyfriend was at because i didn't have one. but of course he ended up finding out i went to homecoming with another boy and that's how i was nicknamed whore and slut by the boy i once believed i was gonna marry SKKSKS hahaAHAHAH.

then forward, it was god awful. and i don't blame him. i did make a few mistakes that i do regret now. because although we weren't together, i should have been smart about it, and i wasn't. it was something new everyday. he would intentionally find reasons to degrade me and make me feel like shit. he even pressured me into publicly announcing that the things i had said about him to other people and on social media (during our time apart) were only for attention and to display him as a fucking cunt. which is COMPLETELY false. i said those things because i want to bring awareness to the issue of teen relationship abuse (even though the situation had barely started, and it was nowhere near as bad as it gets.) he blamed me for his suicide attempted as well. i blamed it all on myself. i apologized over and over again. i felt so shameful. that i made a person feel like shit, they feel like they no longer can live.

it got really bad really quickly. i started having extreme suicidal thoughts. i really struggled with self-harm and had frequent anxiety attacks.

because what the hell was i supposed to do? i wanted to end my life and i couldn't tell my mom because i wasn't supposed to be talking to him and if she found out, she would take away all my shit forever.

so i cried.i cried and i cried and cried. i begged for him to forgive me of all the things i've ever done. i did everything i could to get him to stop screaming at me and degrading me. i went as far as holding up a knife to my throat and having a meltdown episode. (which by the way, he has on recording and he has threatened me so many times with it- but we will get to that.) he called me fucking filthy, a slut, a whore, he told me i don't deserve to be alive, he told me that he hopes someone abuses me so i can ""feel the pain i've caused him.""

October 31, 2018

I get a call 3 am. and that night was the night i decided it was time for me to end my life. an hour and a half i dreaded. i never cried so hard in my entire life. my voice was raspy and my throat hurt after the call ended. it was the loneliest i had ever felt. i didn't want to text my friends because they told me all the time i deserved so much better and i never listened. i didn't want it to be a ""told you so"" moment for me. so i kept to myself.

i never went back to sleep. i sat in my room in the dark. my thoughts were racing and i was a whole mess. that night was probably the most mentally unstable i've ever been. it was the lowest point i've ever reached. i wasn't sure if i could go to school or not, but i knew that if i stayed home, i wouldn't be able to make it through the whole day without driving myself insane.

this entire time, my mom, stepdad, and dad knew absolutely nothing about this. they had no idea any of this was going on. so going to school a wreck and having to call my mom mid first period and tell her i was having suicidal thoughts was absolutely terrifying. my school counselor sent me home. my step-dad spent all day trying to find therapists for me when they came across an OP facility near me. i went to get evaluated to see what kind of treatment was best for me, and they said that PHP was the best option for me.

PHP = partial-hospitalization program. which basically is a hospital program but instead of it being overnight, you go home during the day.

i was scared. im not going to lie. i didnt know what to expect and i wasn't familiar with mental health.

to sum up my experience at the op facility- i was in the faith based group. i was with about 6-8 other people. but teens were constantly discharging, so making friends and watching them leave was hard. i got the help i needed during treatment, but i could also help others with theirs. i learned new coping skills and habits. and i discharged the facility on Dec. 20.

during that time, i had multiple meltdowns. throwing things, screaming, crying. i hope it never gets that bad again.

but you know what never went away?

the fucking thought of him seeing me somehow.

he was messaging my mom all throughout my treatment. calling her a bitch, cunt, liar, etc.

then he started messaging me, when i got my phone back. he made seven new accounts on instagram to harass me. i've changed instagram accounts three times. didn't even go by the same name. he's tried logging into my email accounts. he had access to my spotify account and wiped all of my songs. because he knows how much i love music. he even logged into my fortnite account and removed all of my friends &amp; friend requests. he's had people send me messages, threatening me and saying awful things. he even went as far as sending me the video of me holding the knife up to my throat when i was having a meltdown otp with him.

he still harasses me today. the last i've heard from him was about a week and a half ago. he messaged me and told me to stop wearing the adidas joggers he sent to me. so he knows what i wear now. there's moles in my snapchat. he also knows the names of my friends, their social media accounts, my family's names, my address, where i work, what my phone number is, my email accounts, where i go to school.

and i know most people are just going to say ""just block him"" ""just ignore him""

it's not that simple. it's not that fucking simple.

and i do ignore him, i don't reply.

but when you're constantly being harassed and stalked, it's hard to just ignore what he says.

i can block every account he creates to harass me, but he still gets his message across.

and it's becoming easier to just not to actually take in what he's saying to me. but this shit is so hard.

i went on a date with a boy two weeks ago. he's very kind and patient with me because he knows what i'm currently going through. well, we kissed. and when i pulled back, he asked me why i was shaking. he could literally feel me shaking.

i just hate how this stupid fucking dickhead has literally consumed me. i don't even feel like the same person anymore.

i've been diagnosed with PTSD, and i have a neurologist appointment soon to look further into my memory issues.

i'll end my story here.

i hope no one ever has to go through this.

TL;DR My long-distance abusive relationship put me in a mental hospital and still harasses my family, friends, and i.",intoksikated,2019-01-22 07:49:20,0,2529,15.38,35.49,68.92,3.65,12.04,13.8,94.42,60.42,24.2,19.22,11.94,0.83,0.16,5.93,0.36,4.98,3.68,11.9,9.61,5.93,8.46,2.61,20.25,4.31,2.06,1.46,1.27,1.46,6.96,2.29,4.59,0.59,2.25,0.67,14.55,1.11,0.4,1.86,5.42,12.85,2.73,2.1,1.98,1.27,2.02,3.48,2.41,0.43,1.19,0.75,2.97,1.15,1.15,0.59,0.08,7.28,2.73,1.19,2.17,1.5,0.55,9.45,8.15,1.11,13.72,2.33,5.26,6.48,1.23,0.91,0.51,0.4,0.24,0.24,2.1,1.23,0.32,0.24,0.24,0.08,16.84,8.19,3.4,0,0.08,0.2,0,0.59,0.47,2.69,1.11,0.12

airbr7,History of abuse is making it hard for me to know if I’m interpreting things objectively and could use outside insight,"I apologize in advance that this is long. Also has quite a few details involving sex/adult content and abuse history. I hope it’s all ok; I’ve never posted here but did try to check the rules first. This is a throwaway account for privacy reasons.

Long story short, I have a history of abusive relationships. An abusive marriage that was mostly emotionally, sexually, verbally, and psychologically abusive with a lot of physical threats. Then a shorter relationship that was physically and verbally/emotionally abusive and ended in a protective order and stalking. I’ve gotten a lot of counseling to understand how to avoid these types of relationships and process/handle the PTSD and try to process my not so great upbringing too (alot of emotional and religious abuse and forced isolation due to the cultlike environment). Since then I’ve seemed to gravitate towards relationships where things are low drama but there’s also very little communication (on both sides), and so things get boring and end eventually, but at least they’re not abusive. I did recognize one toxic relationship forming and ended it within a few weeks, so I figured the therapy had helped. 

That brings me to my current boyfriend. I’m 30 and he’s in his mid 40s for reference, neither of us have children or plan to. We got together last summer; we’d been friends for years before that. I had avoided dating him for two reasons before that; one was that we had so many mutual friends and I knew from past abusive relationships how much that can complicate things, and 2., he always just seemed to blame others for his problems and I saw that as a red flag. But he otherwise acted very nice and helpful, and others talked very highly of him. Things kind of just happened last summer and I decided to give it a shot, thinking maybe I was overthinking it. 

Things were ok at first, although he never acted as “nice” as everyone claimed he was. He would “joke” and tell people we weren’t dating when we were; this was very weird given he didn’t seem to be pursuing other girls or anything, and he finally stopped doing that. But otherwise things seemed fine. Then we decided to be roommates a few months after dating. I normally wouldn’t want to move in with someone I was dating so quickly, and have turned down a guy in the past for that, but I was in a fairly bad situation with a live in landlord (as in I probably could’ve sued but just wanted out) and don’t have a lot of good options, being a student in a city that’s in an affordable housing crisis. So I agreed after he suggested it multiple times, figuring I wasn’t on a lease and could leave and that we had known each other for years.

Once I moved in, his behavior got a little more concerning. He’d make mean comments about my body, that I was fat (I’m fairly average/athletic), ate too much, that I was too muscular, that my hair was too short, that I should change it back to platinum blonde, that I “looked like a lesbian” (which is particularly an issue given I’m bi, which he knows), etc. He’d always say these in such a random, offhanded way though that they’d throw me off guard and I wouldn’t even know how to respond, and he’d try to act like it was a joke, although it really didn’t sound like it. And then be very nice otherwise. He also acted like he didn’t want me to move in, even though it was his idea. I did say something about that, and he apologized and said he was just joking/didn’t mean for me to think that. He also punched a door when I was not home, over getting frustrated with fixing it. All of this concerned me, but it was so incongruent with how he was as a friend before we dated and even how he was most the time with me that I brushed it aside. 

Also, when we first started dating, we had sex constantly. We found we were very sexually compatible, and that we both are into light to moderate bdsm. This was great as I hadn’t really felt sexually compatible with several other relationships. But one time, while doing bondage, he kept putting his hand over my mouth and nose. I flat out and very clearly told him to stop 4 times before he finally did. That makes me panic and is a hard no for me. And afterwards, he brought it up and basically said it was no big deal and he really wouldn’t promise not to do it again when I kept insisting I didn’t like it. When I look back, that incident absolutely destroyed my sex drive with him. We rarely have sex now. I always panic. I didn’t know how to talk to him about it, since he was so dismissive when it happened. Shortly after, he also, out of nowhere, started talking about an at the time high profile sexual assault allegation. Talking about how the guy should be given the benefit of the doubt, that she might be remembering wrong, etc. I said very little and never brought any of it up to begin with. He doesn’t know about the sexual abuse history but he does know the abuse in general history, so I really didn’t know what to make of all this. It was like he was trying to scare me by bringing that up in the news; it made no sense given he knows my history. You’d think he’d at least not say it out loud. It did make me not trust him and I’ve had almost no sex drive in the months since (which he only makes snide comments about, never asks me why). He also had a tendency to grab me sexually randomly when we weren’t even being intimate, which I think made that other incident harder to get over, but he finally did stop that once I complained enough times. There was another very bizarre sexual incident after all that where we were standing by the bed, getting ready to go to a friends’ gathering. He started kissing me from behind and I said something like “we need to get going/ready”, and then he pulled my pants off (I was wearing loose clothing) and started bending me over. I started to panic and started to kind of push away and say “were going to be late”. He shoved me away and said “I wasn’t going to fuck you” and stormed off. A little bit later, he apologized without me saying anything for “being crabby”. 

All this said, things did seem to get better for a while though. The negative comments lessened a lot. We do have fun together and hobbies in common, and it’s just plain a good roommate situation too, with him doing a decent amount of housework and me doing most the cooking. But maybe a month or so ago, there was another incident and things seemed to happen more often again. We had been drinking, so I assume that made it worse. We were watching tv and he was changing it to a different streaming service. I said something explaining how the one he was switching it to worked, and he suddenly out of nowhere got angry and threw the remote very hard. I don’t even understand why it made him angry except that he seems to get sensitive if I tell him how to do things. Because I was drinking, I didn’t let it slide and yelled at him. That started an hour long argument with him telling me it was “baggage” from my exes that made me so upset about it, when really it’s not ok to throw stuff regardless, especially over something so small. I think he may have eventually apologized but between being a little drunk and being so shocked and upset, I really can’t remember for sure. The next day I was still very upset by this incident. I texted him and told him we need to talk about this sober, because I had been holding way too much in. He said that was fine but that he didn’t want to do it over text. But neither of us brought it up. I honestly felt too anxious to do so. There was another time when drinking where he “hit” (not very hard) my cat for hissing at his dogs. I got mad because 1. I don’t believe physical correction helps animals, and 2. It’s going to make her more afraid when we’ve been trying to get them to get along. He claimed it was a “tap” and acted like I was crazy. He also gets very angry at his dogs when they whine and bark in the car (this is sober of course) and slammed on the brakes very hard until I told him it scared me and then he did stop. And hasn’t done it again. He also did say I have a “fat ass” recently, and when I got upset, claimed I had called him fat so it was ok. I’ve never ever called him fat (he’s not and I wouldn’t say that even if someone was bigger), but he tried to claim that me saying I wasn’t sure if his pajama bottoms would fit on me without a drawstring meant he was fat. I in no way meant that... every man I’ve dated, even underweight ones, have had a larger hip size than me and their clothes have always been too big on me. I just have narrow hips even when I want to lose a little weight. I really had a hard time believing he really thought I was saying that or that it was reasonable, and he refused to respond when I said that any averaged sized man would likely have too large clothes for an averaged sized woman. Even arguing that felt ridiculous because it just seems fairly obvious to me. He’s also said I shouldn’t buy things at the grocery store because I’ll have to “work them off”.

There was also a time more recently with an outright fight, where again there was drinking. I’m considering not drinking anymore because everything seems worse when alcohol gets involved. Anyway, he got annoyed at me for telling him the wrong way to go when we were walking. That somehow started a fight that I don’t remember a ton about but do know it involved me telling him a lot of the things I’ve been upset about and saying I’m too scared to talk to him sober because it blows up, me saying I felt manipulated, and him saying he already apologized for various things (which definitely didn’t happen sober but could’ve happened when we were drinking I suppose) and that he’s not manipulating, and so on. The details don’t matter since the alcohol made it too difficult for me to really express much in a helpful way.

But my problem is I really don’t know how to bring this all up sober. I can stop drinking, and plan to, but that won’t fix the lack of communication. And I’m not sure if overreacting and these are bumps in a relationship between two people with their own complicated histories, and if maybe I’ve been too sensitive and some of it really has been a joke, and if maybe a lot is my fault for letting things slide and not communicating, or if I’m ignoring red flags again and setting myself up for it to become abusive. On one hand, these things sound terrible when I write them out. But on the other, could I be interpreting them as more threatening than they are because of my past? And he goes about this differently than past bad relationships I’ve had. He does apologize sometimes and it’s not nearly as constant as past bad relationships were, and he does seem to have a better awareness of his actions than other situations I’ve had/he does change some things if I explain it bothers me enough. But I also know these things never would’ve happened in my boring but nonabusive relationships. I also find myself keeping all this from my therapist, which I know isn’t a good sign. I can’t talk to friends because we have so many mutual friends. And I keep wondering if I’m somehow causing these things by either not communicating enough or overreacting, or both. And I’m so stressed with school that the thought of moving is overwhelming. 

So anyway I could really use some outside insight into how to interpret and handle all this.

aiuusd,Anyone familiar with pressing charges for forgeries and CPOs,"I’m long out of the situation and moved far away but he has an old checkbook made some forgeries on thanksgiving and Christmas as well as some other protective order violations. I changed my number though so he can’t do much more to reach me and I was pretty sure it was open and shut anyway but the police are now acting like it’s hard to prove and claimed his number is not registered with a name so his calls and messages don’t count as a violation? Nor do emails? It’s confusing. Who else would it be. And it was with his number that I got the order. He has a Verizon account, it might be through his mom’s or something. It has his name and voice in the answering machine...did anyone deal with this?

Anyway, the officer said when he would get a picture of him in the bank he could make a case but the pictures he sent me are not of him. It’s some other guy...I don’t know what to think or what that means. He’s a heroin addict who stole 75$ each time. It’s very obviously a forgery and his handwriting and how he would do it, he didn’t even try to make “my” signature look different than his own on the back of the check. But he got another guy to pretend he was him and with his ID to cash them? The guy doesn’t even look like him..

aixwqc,Ran into my Abuser Today.,"I went to fast food place to pick up dinner for my family today. After I had placed my order I saw him working in the back prepping food. We never made eye contact, but when I noticed him I knew he already noticed me. He had the look of rage upon him. The very same look he would give me for HOURS until my daughter had gone to bed and he could start with beating me. That was when he would start his crap. After she went to bed. So she couldn't see what was really going on. 

Before I noticed him he got to hear the girl working the counter notice my wedding ring. Hear how my husband had the set custom made with pink topaz and diamond accents because topaz in my birthstone. Listen to me tell how my husband and I grew up together and were best friend for many years before becoming a couple and getting married. Most importantly he got to hear how I am truly happy in my life. 

I didn't notice him until after I was done placing my order and paying. I had stepped off to the side to wait for my order to be placed, but when I did notice and saw the look on his face I literally laughed. Not long after that, I could see from the corner of my eye him standing there with his arms folded just staring at me. If I would have looked up, to meet his stare, I know I would have seen his lips pressed, eyes opened wide and eyebrows raised as high as they could go. 

A few minutes before my order was ready my husband walks in. Gives me a hug and kiss. The second we left I told my husband that he was there. He turned to look through the window to see my ex laughing. My husband walked right back into the store staring at him the whole time and asked to speak to the manager. When the manager came he asked for the manager to expect the food for spit. At first, the manager refused but my husband said why he wanted the food to be inspected. Sure enough, there was, in fact, a big fat loogie in one of the sandwiches. My ex tried to say that my husband put it there to blame him. The manager had said asked if he saw us do it because we didn't have time to tamper with the food between the time we walked out and walked back in. The manager offered for us have our food remade, but husband told the manager that we just want our money back. Which we did get back. We also reported it to the police and he was arrested. I am sure he will be fired soon if he hasn't been already.

So as I am safely in my home with my family, this monster is in jail hating me even more and blaming me for ruining his life. Which he has no one to blame but himself. And you know what, I am laughing.

aj1sa5,My father &amp; I really haven't been getting along the past year..,"Alright, I'll try to make this as short as possible but it's really hard there's there's a lot to this story.

I moved in with my father when I was 14 years old after he won a court case for parental rights. We had a pretty normal relationship until I turned around 17. I dropped out of school in 8th grade due to the teachers being very manipulative &amp; self-taught myself while in this home schooling program. 


My father always wanted me to work in construction so he never told me about the regents I was supposed to take along the way that came in the mail. I missed every regent &amp; finally figured out sometime while I was 17. I didn't hold any anger towards my father although I told him that's not what I wanted to do in life. He's been very angry at me since then being naive towards what I'm passionate about.

I've been taking care of my father since I moved in with him back when I was 14 since he's a very sick man. He isolated me from my friends, family, &amp; completely limited me going out. I've went out with my friends once since I was 14 years old (around 16) since my father wouldn't allow it.

Now, let's get to the main issues. My father the past two years has been very verbally abusive. He'd call me a scumbag, cock sucker, say I wasn't his child, &amp; a bunch of other hostiles things to try to hurt me emotionally when he's upset. He doesn't apologize for any of this as well.

I'll bring up some scenarios

**I. My 1st ""physical altercation"" with my father**

My father &amp; I were eating pizza with the money I've been saving up from other family members as gifts for over the holidays since we didn't have anything to eat.. I wasn't fond of a certain slice of pizza but proclaimed that I'm grown up &amp; started eating it anyways. My father told me to give the rest to him &amp; I just told him to have the other slice/i'd take the screwed up one.

This is when he started screaming at me saying things like I should ""pack my bags"" so I just got up &amp; was about to walk away from the table since I didn't want to be involved in any drama. My father stood up in my face screaming at me &amp; all I said was ""Chill, we don't need to be tough over a slice of pizza"" &amp; that's when he punched me in my face.

He was about to go for another swing when I just threw his glasses so he couldn't see. He got extremely mad and charged me. I didn't want to hurt him yet he wouldn't stop attacking so I pulled his hair downwards since I thought I was in actual danger. His glasses lens broke &amp; the next hour &amp; a half he kept saying I was dead to him.

This made me feel really shitty because it's the 1st actual time I've raised my hands to my father but I didn't really directly hit him. I was just trying to defend myself. I helped him find his glasses &amp; that was the end of that day. *(2 months ago)*

**II. Watching a Movie**

I wanted to try to watch a movie with my father since we haven't really been on good terms at all for the past 2 - 3 months. He's extremely right but he's a fan of the avengers. I tried putting that on but he said he wouldn't like the movie due to the actors but he'd give it a shot. 

While I was putting on the movie he asked for his phone yet I didn't hear him nor knew where it was.. He got extremely angry &amp; started screaming at me to give him his phone calling me a whole bunch of slurs. I told him I didn't know where it was &amp; began looking for it until I found it charging in the kitchen. He told me that I should pack my bags *(again)* even though I didn't even really say a word to him &amp; just came in there to try to make things better/spend time with my father. I spent the rest of the day in my room &amp; skipped dinner since I didn't want to see him for the rest of the day.

**III. Diploma**

I got my diploma this year *(yay!)* by passing the NYC TASC Test. My father told me before hand *(along with the rest of my family)* that I wouldn't pass it. My father wanted me to just drop out &amp; try getting into construction while the rest of my family wanted me to study to pass it.

I took the TASC Test &amp; proved them all wrong. My father was amazed at the results but still think college isn't for me even though I want to eventually attend. Other family members were excited but claimed that I just got lucky &amp; it must've been a higher power helping me... I guess that's one way to look at it...

(I received my diploma in the mail on Christmas day :3)

**IV. My father &amp; his personality**

My father will always say he’s right no matter what. Nothing is a conversation with him about anything.. He’ll just tell me orders &amp; I’m supposed to listen to him. I’ll try to go over some arguments by back tracing to make him understand he’s being unreasonable but he claims that I’m trying to “brainwash” him by back tracing the conversation to see what happened &amp; that I’m “abusing” him.

This is the same person who I’ve been helping daily for almost five years now since the rest of his family abandoned him. I gave up apart of my education just to make sure he was healthy &amp; he really didn’t make decisions that’d benefit my future. Everything I’ve earned or done I’ve done with my own two hands.

**V. Jobs**

I wanted to get a job but my father said he wouldn’t allow me to “serve” someone or be in any part time jobs. He kept pushing construction &amp; said that it’s “our lives” since I live in his apartment &amp; we make “decisions together”. I just want to apply for jobs to get some experience. 


**VI. Cleaning**

I scrubbed the guck off the floor of my apartment back in late 2017.. Unfortunately, cleaning supplies burnt my hands &amp; I got fungus off of it. My hands have been peeling on &amp; off for the past year+ now. I’ve finally found a cream that’d help it *(or it seems like that)* but sometimes I’m just too depressed to care about it or forget while I’m laying down.

I’m sick of being called slurs daily

I’m sick of not being able to go out &amp; socialize. I’d probably be awkward as fuck now since I haven’t really socialized with a lot of people irl if I disregard speaking to peeps online.

I’m sick of having someone control my future in a direction I don’t want to go in

I’m sick &amp; tired of constantly being threatened 

Literally every time I ask to go out with let’s say 1 or 2 friends of mine I still have contact with he says they’re planning to jump or “kill” me. He says that one way or another that he’d read me in the news paper the next morning claiming I wouldn’t make it home. He says I can’t handle myself on the “streets”.

So.. Yeah

I have no social life, no work experience, depression, &amp; I don’t know what to do at this point of my life. What should or can I even do about this? I want to make my life better &amp; improve myself. Getting my diploma was a start but I feel like I’m limited to what I can achieve due to the environment I’m in &amp; have no idea what to do.


**TLDR;** Strict father who forces his policies on me. We haven’t really been getting along recently &amp; he has been trying to isolate me + dictate my life. His word is law or else he'll start screaming and go on a rampage.",malcaster,2019-01-23 09:00:45,4,1424,38.6,26.6,79.36,11.29,18.74,11.94,89.33,56.81,22.4,17.35,12.01,0.63,0,4.63,0.07,5.06,4.56,15.03,10.04,5.76,3.72,2.67,21.21,2.6,1.05,1.26,2.04,1.4,4.42,1.62,2.74,0.21,1.05,0.63,12.36,1.97,0.35,0,6.32,12.71,1.19,2.04,1.76,3.02,1.33,4.28,3.09,0.49,1.54,0.91,2.74,0.84,1.05,0.28,0.63,7.3,1.9,1.54,2.18,1.83,0.35,7.65,10.88,0.91,14.82,2.04,6.18,6.95,2.11,1.05,0.84,0.35,0.07,0.14,0.84,0.28,0.21,0.21,0.07,0.07,25.07,6.39,0.84,0.07,2.53,0.07,0.07,0.14,1.4,5.76,1.26,6.53

He always said the break up was complicated and that I would never understand the amount of guilt he felt and why he still had feelings for her, now I understand. He told me they got into a fight over me after a party Saturday night and he went crazy on her while he was drunk for taking my number from his phone. After a five hour conversation he admitted to me that he has cheated on every girlfriend he has been with and has only gotten physical with his ex but this isn't the first time he has touched her. He said he wants to change and be a better man for her and needs to fix himself for her because she deserves it. She has forgiven him and has agreed to give it another chance as long as he lets me go (zero contact). He told me that his lying and cheating already destroyed her and he doesn't want me to get hurt too and that he wants to go no contact. I don't know how to feel at this point. I honestly feel like a pawn in his twisted little game. His honesty might be saving me so much heart ache in the future but why on earth do I feel rejected and played right now? I have so many mixed emotions and part of me actually misses him.

aj700c,I was a “souvenir” to him,"8 years ago, I was young (19f), heavy drug user, had very little contact with my family, and my friends were just like me. I met my ex boyfriend who was 22 at the time, struggling musician, also a drug user. We hit it off and immediately moved in together with a friend of his. He called me his “souvenir”. I loved him to death and I would have done anything for him. That included participating in group sex with the friend that I wasn’t comfortable with. I never said no to him about the sex, but one night I broke down and cried in the shower immediately after and he promised me we wouldn’t do it again. It never came up after that night. In the days that followed the friend told us we had 30 days to move out of the house. My ex said he’d be going back home (across the country). He sold me on a “better life” there where we would be able to raise a family comfortably. We needed to get out because “this place has no soul”. He went before I did, moved in with family and got them to help him find and fund his new home with me. I couch surfed with some family and friends for a month until I could afford to fly out to be with him. I got myself clean, packed my life into 2 suitcases, and I was excited for the new chapter in our lives to start. Once I got there though, I realized he was actually in worse condition than he’d been when he left. He was drinking to the point of blacking out regularly, hiding pills, claiming he wasn’t high when he obviously was. I would confront him about not looking for a job, how much shit he was doing, or that the amount of shit he was doing was affecting our sex life and he would scream at me for being a “negative person”. The physical abuse started early, one night we got into it and I threatened to leave. I packed my shit and went outside to wait for my ride to the airport. He came out, yelled at me to “get the fuck out”, then shoved me. A guy walking by saw us and came to see if I was alright. I said I was fine, terrified of what would play out if I said anything else. He shook his head, looked at me disapprovingly, and walked away. I brought my stuff inside and I think that was the point my ex really realized he could get away with anything, and he did. Punching me in the stomach, grabbing me by my hair and slamming my head into walls, throwing lit cigarettes at me, pushing me out of a window, having unwanted sex with me while I cried, whatever he felt like doing. He would make up excuses for hurting me by saying things like “I didn’t want to talk to you anymore and you were in my way”. Trying to fight back was useless, he was freakishly strong and would actually laugh then hurt me even worse. Eventually I started to make up lies to try and keep him from hurting me, “I might be pregnant” was a go to. He also started talking to other girls on Facebook but if I said something to him about it (even when he used my laptop and didn’t close it) I was a psycho violating his privacy and I couldn’t be trusted. He would gaslight me and say “I never said that/did that!” And it would piss me off to where I would be screaming at him. He would then record me losing it on his phone and tell me he would show it other people if I didn’t act right. He would also constantly ask to borrow money and if I wouldn’t give it to him, I was a “negative person” and “selfish”.  One night I tried to throw a drink in his eyes and run away, he caught up to me, held me by my throat up against a tree in the creek behind our house and asked me “what are you gonna do now?”. That was it. After 3 years of that bullshit I started to finally feel like what I was, a hostage of his ego. I had become just as sick and broke as he was but I had to get out. I found my way out but it’s not one I would recommend to others.  I wanted him to pay in the worst way, so I publicly cheated on him with someone better than him in every way. Better looking, richer, funnier, more talented musically. That might have been why I got 2 flat tires back to back after the breakup (nails were placed perfectly on the ground to go right into the sidewall of the tire). 

In the wake of all these survivors coming forward, a lot of these old memories have resurfaced for me and I’m forced to ask myself the how’s and the why’s. The answer is always the same and it’s the same for these other survivors, because I loved him. I wanted him to go back to who I met. I didn’t understand why he wouldn’t but I would have given anything for that. The other painful piece of this puzzle for me is the reason I didn’t seek help is because I thought nobody would believe me. That is tragic and what’s worse is am not the only girl who’s ever felt that way. I got very lucky but a lot of girls don’t and unfortunately they aren’t ready to leave yet. Please keep an eye on your female friends who get into those fast relationships, they are the perfect targets for this kind of abuse. Let them know you are there for them and please try not to judge them when they do come forward. Even if you can’t get them to leave, knowing that they have your support when they’re ready makes a world of difference.",spaghetti4liiiiiiife,2019-01-23 17:12:43,6,1025,31.73,46.49,65.65,10.85,19.34,11.8,96,64.59,23.32,17.56,9.66,1.07,0.68,5.27,0.88,5.76,5.07,15.41,10.24,5.07,6.93,2.54,21.85,4.2,2.54,2.05,1.07,1.07,6.24,2.54,3.71,0.39,1.37,0.98,14.15,0.49,0.88,0.39,5.46,12.29,1.66,1.46,3.22,2.34,1.07,3.9,3.22,0.88,1.46,0.88,3.12,1.07,1.17,0.59,0.39,8.1,3.22,1.27,1.76,1.85,0.88,9.95,8,0.88,16.68,3.32,8.39,5.95,0.29,1.07,1.07,0.59,0.1,0.1,1.17,0.68,0.1,0.1,0,0,14.73,4.98,4,0,0,0.1,0.1,0,2.34,2.34,0.78,0.1
aja03g,Friend (25f) is afraid no one will believe her that her ex (28m) raped her,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I’m at my wits end. I’ve been watching my friend (25f) slowly get back into full dominated control by her abusive ex (28m). 

Quick background: they were married 4 years ago. Have a 4 year old with shared custody. His parents kicked him out of the house and she was nice enough to let him crash on her couch. That turned into him thinking he could get “his family back together” and he became the controlling guy he was in the past. All that resulted yesterday in him coming home on a lunch break and forcing himself on her. 
She’s afraid that the cops won’t believe her as he’s been sleeping at her place for a few weeks now. We also live in the south and she doesn’t have such a great experience with law enforcement (she’s black, he’s white). 
I don’t know what to tell her but to go ahead and report it. The cops should be able to arrest him and get him kicked out of her place (she is the only one on the lease). She keeps telling me “that won’t work. I’ve gone through this before. No one will believe me. I allowed him to be here”. 
If nothing changes, this will only keep happening over and over. I’m so afraid of her safety and sanity. It took her a few years to get past the relationship with him. What can I do to help her?",ThrowMeFurther2102,2019-01-23 23:18:40,12,259,33.21,89.15,3.42,15,12.33,11.97,93.82,59.07,22.78,18.53,4.25,0.39,0,13.51,0.39,4.25,5.41,13.51,11.97,3.47,5.02,2.7,21.62,4.63,0.77,0.77,1.93,1.16,3.86,1.54,2.32,1.16,1.16,0,19.69,1.16,1.16,7.34,6.56,7.34,2.7,2.32,1.16,0.39,1.16,0.77,1.54,1.16,0,0,1.54,0.39,0.39,0.39,0.39,11.2,3.86,1.54,3.86,2.32,0.39,6.18,12.74,2.7,16.99,2.32,8.49,6.95,1.16,0.39,1.93,0.39,0,0,0.77,0,0,0,0,0,19.69,7.34,0.77,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,1.54,4.63,4.63,0

ajldai,He just took all my money,"It was only $60 this time but I feel completely stuck and lost and with the new rules he just imposed I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get out.

TL;DR bf gets mad takes away all my rights and forces me to obey his rules and I have no one to talk to. 

Even if you don’t read all of this and just want to comment on the first few lines or even a random paragraph, any comments would be appreciated, even if I can’t reply bc he’s watching me

Wall of text: 

He has taken and controlled my money pretty much since we got together. We originally agreed that I would maintain my financial independence in the relationship but he started thinking I was always cheating on him and started raping me violently. I tried to leave but he found out and took my phone, all access to the outside, and basically held me hostage until I agreed to giving him control of my finances, giving up my phone and getting on his plan, and putting a tracking app on my phone (which wasn’t accurate and got me in a lot of trouble but that’s a different story.) I fought back as long as I could but he wore me down. I have in and things seemed to get better.

Now he doesn’t rape me violently but does expect sex and sexual acts from time to time and he says I can say no but if I do he gets all pouty and starts a fight within the next hour that escalated to violence/him taking away all my privileges until I have “make-up sex” with him. That’s kind of how I expect tonight to end.

He took away the list of rules and says I can do whatever I want and that I’m free, but when I disagree or talk to him in the wrong tone or do anything that used to be on the forbidden list, he uses the things he controls like my money and phone as leverage to punish me. Usually he says it was because I was being spoiled or disrespectful or lazy or just treating him like shit but I know those are just excuses and it’s really because I broke a rule.

Today I just knew he was going to do something. I don’t know if it was the sharpness in his voice or a look in his eyes but I remember thinking when we woke up that I should be extra submissive today because he seems like he could blow up. The thing is that nothing was going wrong. We got up, had some coffee together, enjoyed nice conversation about current events, and then he suggested we start doing the cleaning we had planned to do today. Even though everything was fine it’s like I just KNEW somehow.

So we hadn’t eaten breakfast or lunch and it was about 1:00 this afternoon, my sugar dropped and I sat on the floor for a minute to rest before going to the kitchen to eat something. I pulled out my phone to scroll Reddit, and he snaps at me to stop being lazy and get off my phone because he’s still cleaning and that’s really inconsiderate. I tried to stay submissive and told him I was sorry and that I just felt my blood sugar drop and sat down and that I was about to get food. I even asked if he wanted me to make him something but he didn’t say anything. 

As I walk away to get my food he yells down the hall about how my excuse was bullshit and I’m just lazy and said that scrolling Reddit doesn’t help the shakes go away. I try not to engage and just get my food, eat, and come back. 

I immediately get back to work and he starts in on me again, albeit with fake niceness this time. He asks me to please stop being lazy and get off my phone so that we can get everything accomplished. I told him I wasn’t even on my phone anymore and he just yells “BULLSHIT” (he was looking directly at me and could see that I wasn’t and had put it away before even walking in the room) and started drilling me on whether I was on my phone while I was eating. He just kept yelling over and over in an increasingly aggressive tone “did you use your phone while you were eating?” I told him I didn’t like the way he was talking to me (it was irrelevant whether I was on my phone while eating anyway, it’s not like it takes extra time to eat just bc you’re looking at something- plus I couldn’t even remember if I was scrolling or not because all I could think of is how he was treating me like shit and I didn’t do anything wrong and I just have to take it and that the day was about to be ruined) and so I told him I was shutting the conversation down. He yells over me “so that mean it’s a yes then” and goes OFF about how I’m a lazy liar and will do anything to get away with my bullshit and how I don’t do anything around the house and he cleans up after me all the time and how I always derail him by “fucking around on my phone” and neglecting my responsibilities. He wouldn’t quit yelling, and this whole time I’m still cleaning. I’m sure in his head he thinks he was MAKING me clean and that without his guidance I would be lazy and content living in filth like my abusive mom (in reality I have OCD as a result of being raised in filth and poverty and I would literally kill myself if I had to live like that again, but that’s another story)

I kept begging him to stop and was all like “look I’m still cleaning I didn’t stop” and he said that was bullshit because I did stop cleaning to play on my phone. He said he wouldn’t stop until I apologized and I said I wouldn’t bc I didn’t do anything wrong (I should know better by now right? It’s like I was pretending I wasn’t in an abusive relationship and actually had the right to not apologize for false accusations, but here we are) and I told him he should apologize to me for telling me what to do and also for snapping at me for needing a break due to health issues/ not eating. He of course got more mad and basically just kept telling me how worthless I am, how I don’t make enough money, I don’t clean enough, I’m too sensitive and should get over the abuse of the past, I could go on for days but it’s usually the same stuff every time we get into it. Basically he puts more time and money into this relationship than he thinks I do and the sex he took in rape and the sex I “willingly” have to give him now even though he KNOWS I hate it doesn’t count for anything and if I want to make the argument that it does count then I’m just a whore that’s not worth his time or money anyway.

I digress. I told him I was done and put headphones in and let him rant and continued to clean for several more hours. He left and hung out with some friends while I cleaned and I hoped he had cooled off but when I wanted a cigarette he said he’s not obligated to give a cunt like me anything. I told him I give him all my money and surely I can afford a cigarette and he laughed and said I don’t make shit and I can’t even afford the basics of food and shelter so I damn sure can’t afford a cigarette. I make 2k a month it’s not much but the only reason I even work this job is bc it gives him healthcare (I don’t even use it) and I was hoping he’d go to therapy since we have insurance now but it hasn’t happened. Anyway I think 2k should be enough for my $300 rent, $200 utilities (my share after being split 3 ways) and $80 phone bill. I only smoke 1/2 a pack a day so that’s like $3 per day and I get free food at work. (I’m actually considered a very capable and professional manager at work lol funny how the dynamic changes and I’m worthless at home) I think most of my money goes to food but he gets to pick everything. He asks sometimes what I want but it still has to be one of the things he wants. I would be happy on canned black beans and tuna every day if it meant I could save money, plus I don’t even really need the groceries bc again free food at work. He still “charges” me for 1/2 regardless of what he wants to get (could be steak for several nights of the week) or how much I actually eat. Either way my paychecks get spent in full every month and sometimes he says I didn’t make enough and so my “debt” carries over to the next month.

Wow I digress again, anyway, he told me if I want cigs to go to the store and get some. A coworker gave me like $30 twice to cover a shift so I was gonna use that to get a cab and go to the store. I hate that I smoke but it often feels like the only way I’ve survived through this for 6 years. 

He got furious that I had saved any money and demanded to go through all my things “to see what else [I’ve] been hiding” or he would shut my phone off. He told me he was done with me and I needed to leave knowing full well that I can’t, and berated me for being in such a financially desperate situation yet still willing to spend like $20 for a pack of cigarettes. Eventually he threw a cig at me and demanded I give him all my cash since I owe him anyway apparently. 

He then, knowing I can’t leave, detailed a plan for us to live together until I can afford to go. He says I buy my own groceries and cigs (I’ll save money there, he also smokes more than I do so I end up paying for his too since we split the cost equally. I only smoke like 1 cig a day while I’m at work and my shifts are 12hrs while he’s home chainsmoking so then we have to get another on my way home from work) but then he says he’s going to charge me for insurance for his car (we actually split the car payments evenly when he first got it for a few months until he got fed up with the loan company and paid it all off) and that I would have to give him like $15 per ride plus a tip since I’m fine riding in cabs I shouldn’t mind.  I should also add that I cant drive bc my abusive parents didn’t teach me and he has never let anyone give me lessons and refuses to let me save for lessons, and any time he gave me “lessons” it was basically just him literally screaming at me for not listening and being a cunt because I didn’t know how to turn or brake smoothly yet. Then the argument continues when we get home and it ends up like tonight where I lose privileges and get new rules so even though I was getting better at driving despite the new crippling anxiety I feel when I get in a car, I quit taking lessons from him bc I was afraid I would lose my job bc he would keep me up all night arguing and I missed a couple shifts because I didn’t wake up in the morning even with alarms. He says he’s also going to charge me for other things, like chores he does when I’m not home and stuff I can’t remember all of it but I’m sure I’ll get in trouble later because I didn’t listen well enough. 

I know I need to leave, like bad, but I feel like I’m in a relationship with a loan shark and I can’t ever get out from under this. Plus I have nowhere to go because abusive parents and all my cousins and siblings are younger than me and couldn’t take me in. All my aunts, uncles, and grandparents live too close to my parents for comfort plus my parents have pretty much ruined their lives too so I doubt they’d even want me. I would seem too much like my mom in this state.  Also I can’t have friends of my own and my only friend who knew anything about my home life died like 6 months ago. So I just feel totally screwed.
.
The only reason he’s not rn is bc he can’t stand to be around me and I’m sleeping on the couch. This sub has helped me so much to feel like I’m not alone. I feel like I may never get out and that you kind souls can’t really help me physically— but you’ll help me by keeping my spirits up just by being someone alive in the world who knows what I’m going through. I am committed to leaving I just had my plans shattered and have to start over, so I needed to vent and hopefully get a little encouragement!

ajmvbl,Guess Anger Means I Am Healing,"Tonight I have not seen him for 3.5 days.
I hate him so much.
I get the short end of the stick.

I have so many bumps on my head from this past year.  Found out today I might have gestational diabetes.  He refused to walk with me.  He beat me for being confused and sad.

And he will be fine.  I will have to stitch this up myself.  This big massive hole.  He says my mother had already traumatized me.  It doesnt matter.  No one ever beat me before.

He said I wanted to be beaten.  He is more stinky than fermented eggs.  He is more ugly than Dan Akroyd in Coneheads.  His soul is poorer than a one legged thief, with bedbugs, in Mumbai.

He is more unwanted than a major bedbug infestation.  I would rather skin myself than see him again.  His hypocrisy is as wanted as a bonobo who throws poop. 

I never want to see him again.  I am angry he is not texting me.  I blocked him on messenger.  I hate that his house is dilapidated, but all he does is obsessively put down my rental.  He literally stinks like a homeless person.

I would like to tell him I cant wait to see him toothless.  I would love to tell him how his youthful looks have faded.  I would like to tell him that biting my jugular artery like a cannibal will NEVER resolve his impotence, and that sole element of his power over women is PAST ITS PRIME.

I cant wait to not be angry.  But at least I am not loving him tonight.  Even if I am angry he didnt text, that he is just a gold digger.  I hate him.  I hope his soul burns so slow in hell you can roast smores on it.

He didnt have to punch my kidneys when i begged him not to hit my head again.  Not like u need kidneys for gestational diabetes.  Severe physical abuse makes gestational diabetes 68% more likely.

I hope his ankles snap and his spinal discs slip and he gets a sideshow large donkey sized kidney stone and gout and an amputated diabetic legs all at once and ONLY THEN would he begin to feel the level of hurt I feel now.

It started off with him damaging my car, to getting it impounded and now to him slapping, choking, pulling my hair and verbally abusing me when he is mad at me. It kills me because despite it all he is all I want. He did it again a few hours ago and I begged him to stop and to just hold me because I know this has to end... And all I wanted was for him to hold me tightly for the last time... I don't want to be a single mother but then again I don't want my baby to feel my pain and sorrow. How can someone make me feel so safe and yet so battered. How can I crave his warmth after he pulls my hair out of slaps me around.

ajs5r2,Nervous Abuser is Coming Back,"Hi All,

I'm a DV survivor and I've recently learned that my ex-husband's (my abuser) current gf is planning on trying to join my roller derby team. It scares me because not only was he physically/mentally/emotionally abusive while we were together but he also stalked me and harassed me &amp; partners I've had years after we were over (EVEN WHILE DATING HIS CURRENT GF). He's always been pretty unstable and extremely unpredictable.

I've accidentally run into him and his gf (who's trying to join my team) in public in the past both of them have tried intimidating by glaring at me and lingering in areas where I'd likely need to walk to (e.g. restrooms) and showing up at places they'd know I'd be at just to IDK make me feel uncomfortable? Rub it in my face that they're dating? IDK! I don't know what he has told her but I know if she starts coming to derby, which has been honestly one of the things that has saved me, that I won't be able to handle it.

My teammates are trying to figure out a way to have her not come but I just don't see how any scenario would be a safe scenario for me. If we tell her she can't come, they'll know it's bc of me (my team is small and my face is on their social media a lot) and I'm worried he'd try and find me and do something to me bc of it. If we let her come and tell her he's not allowed to be around, I'm worried that will also piss him off and he will come and find me about that. I feel like it is a lose lose either way and I am so scared and don't know what to do.

Part of me feels like I'm being ridiculous or overly dramatic since it has been awhile since I've had any sort of interaction with them but another part of me is so scared and worried about the unpredictability of this person, I legit have been worried that if I ever were to be murdered, it'd be because of him.  I guess I'm posting here for maybe ideas of what to do and/or support about this. It's driving me crazy and I think about it every day. I thought this was all over. forever.

ajuac4,My boyfriend has been harassed. Help me understand and support him,"So my boyfriend is on this college team and there is this coach (Let's call him X). He is also gay, kind of like the same age as him, and the whole team has a really good relationship with him.

X is clearly into my boyfriend and keeps hitting on him, knowing that he is dating me. He has been very uncomfortable and touchy in a disrespectful way. Also he keeps commenting on my boyfriend's pics.

My boyfriend has told some of the head team members, but none of them seemed to care about it.

As his boyfriend, I advised him to unfollow him on social media and keep as much distance from him as possible. Since I've been harassed and this really helped me get some distance.

He agrees with me, but never really did it. Even though I said it more than once, and I noticed he actually got angry with me having said that. Not only that, but he also likes the pictures of X, and likes his comments when X comments on his posts.

I know the victim is never guilty for what the other people do. But I really would like to understand my boyfriend's attitude and what can I do to help him.",gabot98,2019-01-25 14:07:38,0,219,11.31,70.83,18.07,33.65,14.6,15.53,95.43,63.47,23.29,17.81,8.22,0.46,0,8.68,0.46,5.48,3.65,12.33,9.13,8.68,10.96,1.83,18.26,4.57,3.65,1.37,0.46,2.74,5.94,3.2,2.74,0.91,1.37,0,21,0,3.2,0,11.87,12.79,2.74,0.46,0.46,2.28,1.37,5.94,1.83,0.46,0.91,0.46,0.91,0.46,0,0.46,0,10.5,7.76,1.37,2.28,1.37,0,5.02,11.87,0,7.76,0,4.57,3.2,2.28,1.83,0,0,0,0,0.46,0,0.46,0,0,0,13.24,6.39,4.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.83,0.91,0

ajy96i,Id like to share some advice that could keep you safe in the future,"I've noticed that people who end up in abusive relationships tend to find similar partners again and again. The victim is usually blamed for it (ignoring red flags etc) but please consider this. 
If you've been abused you my be vulnerable, abusers know this and seek it out. They are Like sharks when there is blood in the water. Please consider staying single until you are confident and in a good state of mind to make sound decisions. The pain and rejection of abuse makes it easy to fall for someone who is finally treating you well. 
A decent potential partner will see you need space, and will be there when you are ready. Be cautious of ""rescuers"". It is not your fault if you've been through this more than once. It's just how hunting work. Be safe guys and girls. And give yourself time to recover.",missymerc,2019-01-25 21:45:15,9,161,27.81,93.97,34.65,25.77,12.38,16.15,95.03,57.14,16.77,8.7,1.86,0,6.21,0,0.62,8.07,3.73,13.04,13.04,6.83,8.7,0.62,21.74,4.97,3.11,3.11,1.24,1.86,13.66,6.83,6.83,0.62,3.11,0.62,14.91,0,1.86,0.62,0.62,13.04,3.73,1.86,2.48,3.73,0.62,3.11,2.48,1.24,0.62,0.62,1.86,0.62,0.62,0,0.62,10.56,2.48,2.48,3.11,1.24,2.48,3.11,16.15,2.48,12.42,1.24,4.97,6.83,0.62,0.62,0,0,0,0,0.62,0,0,0,0.62,0,13.66,7.45,1.24,0,0,0,0,0,1.24,2.48,1.24,0

ak2rql,I [17F] don’t know what to feel about my older sister [23F]. I feel like what she does is not okay but she is still my family.,"Hi all. Am a mobile user. I live with my parents and my older sister. Here in my country moving out at a young age is not common at all. I’m from a household that doesn’t really talk about feelings. 

Ever since I was little, my sister would have crazy temper tantrums. When I had my first friend over at the age of 8, she would scream at me and cause a scene just because her computer isn’t working. When I was little, I rocked my chair. She got annoyed, accidentally kick the chair out of anger and I fell on my back. I have some memories of pretty messed up stuff that she did. I could never make her angry or she’d come back for me. She would torture my toys and my little teddy bears and forced me to crawl and find them in the dark. 

Since I became a teenager, her anger tantrums would get worse. My parents aren’t home often so I’d have to fend for myself. Some instances include:

1. She’s sleeping in my room because there was an insect in hers. I accidentally say the wrong words and she gets really angry. I tell her I’m really tired and need to sleep since I have school tomorrow. She forces me to say sorry and explain clearly why I was wrong. She would blast loud music until I give in and apologise to her so that I could sleep.

2. I accidentally piss her off. So she’s mad. She turns off our house router (and essentially our wifi) and guards it. If I try to turn it on she’ll push me. She says she will only turn it back on if I apologize to her.

3. I say the wrong thing, she comes home angry. She threatens me something like watch what she’ll do when she gets home. I lock my door. She bangs and screams at it constantly. When I try to close it , she forces her way in and pulls at me. 

4. Alot of times she threatens to destroy my items just because I made her angry. Like pour water over my paper work, school work etc. 

5. I can think of many instances where I had to lock my door from her coming in and ruining my things. Once, I had to run out to collect everything valuable in the living room and run back in to lock the door.

6. Once, we went out together. I made her angry and she locked me out of the house. Told me I could only come back in if I apologized.

7. Yesterday night, she was looking for an item of mine. She was really angry about it getting lost and forced me and my mum to look for it. She tries to find them in my room and says says to me that I should get out of the way if I’m not helping. She then purposely messes up my stuff, threw something on the floor, flips my books around. I scream at her. She laughs in my face. I got so angry I went to her room to mess her stuff up as well. She grabs me, hard. Gets all up in my face and she looks crazy. Pushes me out of the room. I got a bruise and small patches of my skin came off and is bleeding. 

Today, she apologies in a cute voice and tries to be touchy with me. I tell her I don’t forgive her. I’ve had enough of this. Tonight, she calls me a bitch for not forgiving her. Creates a whole scene. She says I’ve hit her before too. Says I’m a hypocrite. And decides OK, let’s not talk to each other anymore. 

I’m sick of this. She’s literally twice my size due to her bad eating habits. She’s so much older than me. And I have NEVER hit her because of a fight that I instigated. As in I only ever touched her because she was angry first and really threatened me or tried to control me. I only started to push her because she would force herself in my room and stayed there until I apologized for making her angry. She would NEVER listen to me or listen to what I have to say in arguments. When I said something, she would scream in my face non-stop so she wouldn’t have to hear anything. She doesn’t get that IM HELPLESS. She’s left me helpess in all the situations I’ve touched her. But she doesn’t get that. Me trying to hit her has become my only way of self defense or showing myself I’m not weak or helpless. I feel absolutely trapped and not able to do anything so that is my last choice. She never gets hurt thought since she is twice my size. Yet she has left me bleeding from scratches yesterday and before.

It’s hard for me. It’s very nuanced. My mother doesn’t help me or say anything except scold me for purposely creating trouble. She is disappointed that I am not forgiving my sister as I’ve made her life tougher by not doing so. Yet she is not a bad person at all. I don’t see her as an enabler in my mind. She just thinks my sister and I are having a sister fight like all sisters do, creating trouble. I don’t know why she doesn’t see the staggering age difference and how I have always been helpless. I think my sister gaslights me unintentionally too. Because of her behaviour, I have grown to become distant in all of my relationships out of nowhere. She calls me bipolar for this. When I tell her she has issues she says I’m crazy too. But really I’m pretty sure I’m not but sometimes I think I start to doubt myself.

I just wanted to share more of my feelings here. No one has ever stood up for me while I’ve been getting shit. Not even my extended family. Honestly that has broken my heart into a million pieces. My sister is really nice sometimes when she’s not crazy. It’s really hard to understand.  I don’t even classify this as abuse or see her as an abuser. But i feel so broken. She leaves me broken and helpless. Always have. She makes me feel unsafe in my own home, because I’m scared she’ll ruin my things. I always have nightmares. And I always feel really helpless in them. I think I got it from being her sister. I recognise it. It’s the same feeling of not being able to do anything for myself, of feeling trapped and scared and alone. I thought that things would get better when I’m older but I am older now and all I want to do right now is to disappear.",maggiemeecometome,2019-01-26 09:16:17,4,1173,11.85,25.02,80.56,1,10.76,11,94.54,62.32,26.34,22.17,13.81,0.34,0,7.76,0.26,4.18,2.73,13.04,9.97,6.48,7.67,2.81,20.12,4.77,2.05,1.36,1.36,1.45,7.33,1.71,5.63,0.51,2.47,1.02,13.73,1.36,0.09,8.78,0,14.75,2.81,2.9,1.79,2.56,2.05,3.92,4.52,0.85,1.96,1.71,1.79,1.02,0.77,0,0.17,9.04,2.05,1.79,2.9,1.36,1.36,3.41,13.73,0.68,15.17,2.05,7.5,6.05,0.68,0.43,1.53,0,0,0,0.6,0.26,0,0.26,0.09,0,15.69,9.29,1.88,0.09,0,0,0,0.09,0,3.84,0.17,0.34
ak4d3f,Why are batterers such good lovers?,"Like it makes their gold digging okay?
Or substantiates the beatings?

Mine showed up unnanounced last night.
I didnt want him to touch me.
I was physically afraid to say no.

He showed up also to make himself dinner and shower.  The days away from him were like fake freedom.  I regret not turning around and going to get a hotel.  

Now that his ex announced on fb that she is single, coincidentally now he cannot sleep at my house.  So he just thrashes all night long.  I slept on the sofa a few times.

He cant stop saying how terrible my house is.  He used me for everything I had to give.  Money, etc.  My old house was terrible too.  The house before it, not so bad.

I wish they were terrible lovers.

He just got upset I couldnt do the new position he wanted for long enough.  Guess someone else will.

I hate him.",Onomatopea777,2019-01-26 11:55:18,11,162,25.32,40.24,17.67,2.98,7.71,11.73,92.59,56.17,21.6,17.9,8.64,0,0,8.02,1.23,3.7,4.32,11.11,8.02,7.41,4.32,4.32,18.52,6.17,1.85,1.23,0.62,1.85,8.64,3.09,5.56,1.23,0.62,0.62,14.81,0,1.23,0.62,7.41,12.96,0,3.09,3.09,1.85,1.23,4.32,3.09,1.23,1.23,0.62,3.7,1.23,0.62,1.23,0.62,6.17,1.85,0,1.23,1.85,1.23,7.41,9.88,1.85,13.58,0.62,6.17,6.79,0,0.62,3.7,0.62,0,0,1.85,0,0.62,0.62,0,0,14.81,11.11,1.85,0,0,1.85,0,0,0,0,0,0
ak7a13,I (27m) was arrested for battery on my (32f) fiance. But have been a victim of her abuse for months,"This is my first post on Reddit and I need to get this off my chest.  I've been with this woman for over a year we were due to get married in a couple of weeks. She is also 9 weeks pregnant.  She has always had very explosive anger towards me and the past few months even before she got pregnant it has gotten worse.

On Sunday night we were having another fight and I tried to keep my calm.  Every time she has spit in my face belittled me punched me pulled my hair and bit me I have remained calm and have tried to calm her down.  At that night however I had enough so I pushed her onto the couch and I put her in a restraint. I let her go and then she started hitting me again.  After that I picked her up throwing her on the bed furious and yelling at her.  She got off the bed and proceeded to call the cops on me. I stayed there and I waited for the cops knowing I would probly get arrested

 She is only 5' and I am 6' and pretty built.  So it doesn't look very good and I am very ashamed that I laid my hands on her even to just hold her down.  I am scheduled to go to court in a month and we have 30 days of no contact. She threw all my stuff out on the porch and I am staying at a friends.  From what I understand she is feeling sorry and is in communication with my family.  I am the one with the battery case yet I am scared that her behavior is never going to improve. I am scared for our future and our baby's future. 

I still love her more than anything in the world and it breaks my heart every day i cannot talk to her.  Being that I am a male exercising my power over a female I am so ashamed.  Reading some of these posts on this makes me sick yet amazed that some of you women put up with so much violence yet it feels like mine used the police out of a control move or spite.  I'm no Saint but I am not abusive. I have always been so caring and loving towards her. I always make sure she has everything she needs and feels safe and comfortable but now I feel like a monster. 

She was in a very abusive marriage in the past and I think she has considerable trauma from that. I also think that she projects that on to me as if I am the attacker like her father or her ex husband.  To wrap this up I love her and I care so much about her yet I am so hurt and scared at the same time",majora969,2019-01-26 17:05:58,8,501,29.37,45.24,74.5,10.6,17.89,9.78,94.01,63.87,23.75,18.96,11.38,1,0.2,6.39,0,4.79,4.99,14.37,8.98,5.59,8.38,1.2,17.17,3.99,2,0.2,1.2,2.4,7.19,2.99,4.19,1,1.8,0.4,12.18,1.6,0.6,6.99,0.8,7.78,1.6,1,0.8,1.4,1.8,2,1.6,0.2,0.2,1.2,2.2,1,0.8,0.4,0,8.78,2.99,0.8,3.19,1.4,0.4,4.59,10.78,0.8,17.17,2.4,7.58,7.39,0.6,0.6,1,0,0.2,0,0.4,0,0.2,0,0,0,7.19,5.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.2,0.8,0
ak7ybo,How do you escape with animals?,"Okay so lately the abuse has been insane. If you've seen any of my past updates, my mother is the one being abused, I'm just sorta left to defend her when she needs it and support her.

We've talked about escape a lot. But we're always stopped when we remember; ""oh yeah, we have pets. And a lot of them.""

They're mostly mine and I'm willing to move out if i have to, but with my pets obviously. (It's embarrassing to admit, but we have 13 cats and 3 dogs)

I'm stubborn about bringing them, because i don't want to lose what i love because of a bastard who isn't really abusing *me* per se.

ak8m28,He strangled me last night,"My (f21) husband (m20) and I got into a tiff last night. 
Entire story:

I work as a waitress and was closing last night (didn’t get off until 11pm), my husband decided he wanted to call my work because I wasn’t answering my phone to see if I was still there. The host came to me and said some woman is on the phone for you and said someone else wanted to talk to you. 
So without going to answer the work phone (where calls are recorded) I called him immediately, I said babe someone is trying to reach me at work, he said “yeah it’s me” and I started getting upset, I raised my voice and said “babe if I’m not answering my cell phone its because I’m busy and can’t talk” he hung up immediately without saying anything. 
I stepped outside after about thirty minutes to call him and talk after the rush was over and he didn’t answer. Once I got off, I tried calling again and again. No answer. 
So I got home unlocked the door and found him asleep on the couch. His phone was sitting next to him and I tapped on the screen to see if he had already gotten my calls, but they were all on the screen “3 missed calls from Wifey” it said. 
So I woke him up, and asked “why were you impersonating a woman when you called my job” he said “I don’t know what you’re talking about” and got up and went to the bed from to lay down. I followed him and CALMLY asked again “babe, just tell me why you did that” and he got up and smacked me across the head and I slid down to the floor. He laid back down after this and I sat on the floor crying for about five minutes until I gathered myself and went out side to sit in my car for 30 minutes. 
After calling a hotline to talk to someone so that I’d calm down, I went back inside and laid down next to him, I started talk to him and said “why did you hit me” and nudged him awake. He woke up and grabbed my by my neck and drug my to the ground. I started to cry and curled up in a ball in the corner and demanded he not come within 5 feet of me. He said “talk to me” and I said “no” and he repeated himself and before I got an answer out his hands were around my neck again and he was looking at my eyes as I was barley breathing. I begged (with what little air I had left) for him to get off, so he did. I started crying even harder as grasping for air. I grabbed my purse and my phone and ran to the door, where he ran up and shoved it closed and locked it and was standing in the way. At this point I had said “okay, we can talk” so he started asking questions “what are you talking about, I would never impersonate a woman, that kid is lying” and I said “I just want to leave, I don’t think I want to be here when you’re angry” and he grabbed me by my neck and shoved my head and body into the way and said “what about now, wanna talk now?” And I didn’t say another word. I started to feel my self pass out and begged him to stop. He let go and looked at me with eyes the size of golf balls, his pupils were HUGE. I can’t get that look out of my mind, once he was done holding me against the wall by my neck he threw me into the bottom of the back of the recliner and I banged my head really hard on the wood. (I have bruises around my neck and all over my body) 

He then grabbed my phone and wouldn’t give it back until I “promised to start talking” so I did. I sat down and explained what happened at work and what the kid said to me when he called and told me I was a liar, which made him even more up set. 

There’s more after that conversation and eventually he calmed down when I couldn’t open my eyes because my head was hurting so bad and I could barely speak because he had put his hand over my mouth so I couldn’t scream for him so hard my teeth are now wiggling. I stopped fighting to get away and just laying down on the floor where he had left me, I said “just kill me” and he laid on my chest and started apologizing and saying “I want to help, do you need an ice pack” and I said no. I said no to everything he offered. I said I was going to take a bath, so I did. He came in 30 mins after I’d had gotten in and said he wanted to talk and that I didn’t have to. He explained to me that he couldn’t remember a lot of the violence that had just happened because he was woken up from a dead sleep and was “unconscious” 

It’s the next day and my head had lumps all over it. My neck has bruises and my chest does too. 
This isn’t the first time this has happened, we separated over the holidays and I moved back in on the first of January. We made it 26 days without him hurting me and he says “it will never happen again”

I’m currently trying to join the military right now and my plan is to keep the peace until I go to boot camp and then technical school afterwards for my job training and when I’m there I’m going to file for a divorce. Before they move me to my first duty station, so he won’t be going with me. 

I’m terrified every time he raises his voice over a whisper and if I try to leave I know what will happen. 
I don’t need much advice as I’ve already planned what I will be doing, I just needed to get this off of my chest.",catmomm,2019-01-26 19:54:55,11,1053,24.36,46.96,86.91,11.14,27,9.97,94.78,62.68,22.79,19.18,12.44,0.28,0.95,5.32,0.19,3.61,4.37,14.72,7.98,6.36,10.07,2.56,22.03,2.56,1.52,1.9,1.14,1.04,1.99,0.38,1.52,0.19,0.47,0.57,15.1,0.38,0.28,0.38,5.51,7.98,1.61,0.95,1.9,1.42,0.85,2.09,5.6,0.95,3.32,1.33,2.75,2.56,0.19,0,0,7.03,0.95,1.33,3.13,1.42,0.28,11.49,8.83,1.23,18.8,2.75,9.02,7.5,0.95,0.38,0.57,0,0,0.19,0.28,0,0,0.19,0,0,13.58,3.51,2.47,0.09,0,0.09,0,0,3.42,2.85,1.14,0
ak9q9y,I really need your help leaving. 20 weeks pregnant. He punched me in the forehead. I feel so stupid for letting this happen. It's also my fault for losing my mind and being violent too.,"I just feel like the most irresponsible mother that ever existed, and things have just gotten so bad that I don't know how to fix it. I'm not going to call the cops, and he doesn't deserve that. When I finally got him to snap out of it yesterday, he did and he was sorry. I haven't been able to gain weight for WEEKS with this baby, and I've been losing weight more than gaining it. It goes a little up and down. Our relationship is so complicated. We've been together on and off for almost 6 years. I'm turning 27 in a couple of weeks, he's turning 25 this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense, I'm still feeling woozy from yesterday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I really don't feel like it's his fault. I make his life shit, that's what he tells me. I didn't tell him until I was 10 weeks pregnant, I broke up with him when I found out, and because I didn't have an abortion he doesn't really see this baby as his responsibility. Since I got pregnant I started giving him ""his own money"" which was supposed to be savings for the baby. Maybe it still is, but I've got a feeling it's just his money now. That's fine. If it makes him happier. He hasn't had a job the whole time we've been together, besides the first couple of months of us being together, I think.

&amp;#x200B;

He hit me about 3 or 4 weeks ago, but that was after I wanted to leave in the middle of the night because I didn't want to have sex with him or blow him, and I knew he'd probably get shitty. He said he got scared that I wanted to leave so he pushed me onto my butt onto the mattress we sleep on on the floor. My dumb brain-damaged brain decided in that second, 

&amp;#x200B;

""You should give him a good punch in the face so he snaps out of it. He'll see how scared you are. He'll stop.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, I take the blame for that one. It wasn't too bad, couldn't open my jaw without pain for more than a week, but basically nothing happened. He pulled my hair hard, grabbed my own hand and made me punch myself in the jaw, just little things that I can deal with, basically. The worst he probably did was pick me up onto my knees on the bed by my neck and twisted my neck until it cracked and wouldn't let me go. He stopped when I started screaming when he was covering me with his body so I couldn't breathe. He's 6' 2 and a solid guy, I'm 4'11 and was less than 100 lbs when i  got pregnant. 

&amp;#x200B;

I fucked up yesterday, and after I went to his house at 1 am while he was sleeping, after he'd asked me if I was coming over, I made the mistake of talking to him the moment he woke up in the morning about the fight I had with my mum. I don't hear well, and I also made the mistake of not hearing him when he mumbled something to me. He got upset, then I got upset and started acting like an idiot, and I don't really remember how it started but we got violent with each other. I bit him, and he bit my hand and my nose, slapped me pretty hard across the face once, punched me in the forehead although he didn't hit me anywhere near as hard as he could've, but it still made a lump and a graze and it hurt. It feels like my jaw's out of place, but i know it's probably not. It just keeps clicking and i keep getting terrible pain, including through my ear canals, but i had a broken ear anyway, that hasn't had a chance to heal in more than a year.

&amp;#x200B;

We got through it, but he said he purposefully didn't hit me in the stomach, but i seriously feel that the stress of me being in so much pain and under so much stress isn't a good thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that these situations are always a possibility, but i didn't see it coming, and considering i instigated it all,  i feel like the most irresponsible parent that ever existed. I think i'm just so desperate for this to work, and for us to  have a teeny chance of being a family, and honestly, he's a great guy and  I love him so much,  but at least until the baby comes I need to stay away from him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know how.

ak9u8w,I feel dumb.,"Sorry, this is long.

So, 2 weeks ago my husband was drinking and got through 3/4 a bottle of rum. I hate leaving him alone when he drinks and tried to get him to come to bed with me. I got him to come upstairs, but he ended up laying on the floor at the foot of the bed. He was on his back and I was on my knees facing him. Finally, he whispers, ""okay,"" and reaches up and grabs my neck. My thought process was, ""confusion, sex things? fear."" Once I started to feel the hard parts of my throat I pinned his hands underneath mine. This whole situation lasts 10 seconds. I told him that if he ever touched me like that again I would hurt him. Then I got up and turned off the lights in our room and lied in bed. He says, ""Babe, you know I'd never hurt you."" I said, ""It doesn't matter. I felt threatened. We'll talk about it in the morning.""
After that he got up and showered. Then he went downstairs. I followed him because I didn't want him making a racket. He's trying to smoke and he puts a knife to his throat and starts talking about suicide. But ultimately, just starts panicking when he realizes it's 3am and he has work at 9.

The next day he goes to work and I know he doesn't remember anything. I try to sleep, but when I can't I call my chief. (I'm Navy). At this point I'm tired and a blubbering mess and it all came crashing out. She's concerned, and says she'll find a resource for me. 

Finally he gets home and I tell him what happened. He confirmed that he doesn't remember. Is relieved that it didn't seem to be out of anger. 

The next day I find out from Chief that dv is one of those mandatory reportable things and so I have the option of participating in this case management thing where they listen to the story and try to provide resources. Cool. Why not. 

In my first meeting I find out strangling is also a mandatory reportable thing and that goes to NCIS. Meanwhile my husband is being pretty cooperative. He says he has no excuse or explanation. He'll stop drinking liquor. (That's been an issue before too but the strangling was the first time he ever touched me.) Yet he also says that if he's in trouble with the law he'll have to leave me. Fine.

In the middle of this week NCIS calls, asks what happened, if I want to press charges, or file a protective order. I say no and no. And I don't. Despite this, I feel dumb. I feel dumb for getting hurt. (Why didn't I leave him to sleep downstairs?)  I feel dumb for reporting him. (My friend asked why I did that the first time since it's so minor.) And I feel dumb that NCIS sees me as this kid that still loves her abuser. (24f btw).

I am intelligent. I know that things like this escalate. I was physically abused my whole life before moving out of my parents home. My parents are alcoholics. Their marriage is textbook abusive. It didn't start off that way though. And. I also know that I've been with my husband for 7 years. I love him. And can I stop us going down that road and stay with him?

I don't know what I'm doing. I don't usually wear makeup or anything. I've always had a greater sex drive than him, and today I tried pretty hard to get him to have sex with me. It worked, once,  after a while he got into it and was receptive to it. I also tried to make myself look sufficiently fuckable, and was pretty disappointed at the end of the day when he hadn't said a word about my makeup or expressed any sexual interest whatsoever. I don't want to mention it because it's not his fault I'm being immature. I'm just stressed out and want some rough sex. I should wait it out and masturbate in the meantime, right?

Generally speaking, I always knew we had our issues, but still always felt lucky and happy to be with him. 

Ugh. Any insight or advice would be appreciated.

akilf7,I have a friend in mortal danger. I need your advice.,"Hello,

I met my friend a little over a year ago on the internet. She's female, I'll call her A. She had trust issues back then and seemed really hurt. After a while, she talked to me about how she fell in love for the first time with some man older than her, who made her addicted to drugs, made it so she would be financially dependent upon him and have to move in with him. He got violent, he treated her in ways I'd rather not describe but that go beyond physical and psychological violence. Eventually she tried to kill herself and for some reason, he called her an ambulance. As a result, she finally ran. It lasted four years.  


It's been four years since that. My friend has had up and downs, though I think she hasn't managed to deal with a lot of the things that were done to her. The boyfriend I just mentioned reached out to her to apologize, he wanted to meet her, to explain how sorry he is. I warned her about the huge red flags, that if someone is guilty about having done such horrible things, then they'd realize they have no right to ask anything. I argued and argued. She went. I think he forced her to go back to her own place with a knife and raped her. Again, she barely escaped and ran away. That was last summer. Previous to that, she had therapy, and though she was struggling, she was on the path to recovery and was trying to get better.  


Present time now. She started working at a call center of sorts that paid relatively well but was extremely tedious. She met someone higher up the food chain at that company who acted friendly, and after a while, offered her to enact kinks that he has in exchange for money. My friend was heavily depressed by that point and considered herself worthless, so she agreed since in her mind it was an easier way to make money. They set up rules, such as ""the underwear stays on"". She'd go there once a week. After each ""work"" session, she would either consider suicide from a rooftop, or attempt it. I talked to her when she had a bellyful of pills and alcohol, so I'm sure. The violence got worse. There were times she couldn't move from bed the day after work. She was ordered to block me even, though thankfully she didn't respect that to the letter and unblocked me. A few days ago, her car broke down. My friend refuses to borrow money from anyone she views strictly as a friend as it can ""damage the relationship"". She ""only"" needed 800$ to get her car fixed and I'm sure he didn't ask, but the abuser (I'll call him B), probably offered a deal. She'd have to work twice a week for four months and two weeks, and some limits were off the table. For 800$. Considering the mental repercussions of the work previous to that, it's terrifying. She came home from the first work session and she was destroyed. I felt like I was talking to a robot trying to impersonate my friend and that was low on battery. I'm trying every angle, I'm trying to point out how he's trying to lure her in with money, how he tried to suggest paying for her to go back to school in exchange for her working full time, how he's trying to give her drugs like the former abuser did, how the pay is ludicrous as it takes such a toll that it's basically a full time job, and half a full time job doesn't pay 800$ in four months, how she considers him a friend but nothing that he does really indicates that.  


The list goes on, he gives her books to read because she needs to ""better herself"". He gives her drugs because she can't put up with the new things he's making her go through. Somehow she keeps thinking it's ""not so bad"" because she enjoys some of the kinks, and she keeps throwing the same excuses at me ""I'm just tired"", ""he's not so bad"", ""he's nothing like my former boyfriend"", ""he's done so much for me that I can't go away"", ""I made a choice and I have to follow it through"", ""I have to be strong"", ""it's not abuse"". I get that all of these are just things she tells herself to make her life bearable, but I  don't know how to get through to her. Before her car broke down I was making SOME progress by getting her to think about how life could get easier and that the job was harmful to her. Now it's all gone. His control is almost absolute. I feel completely powerless as I witness my friend get tortured every week. I'm trying to reach out to some people in her life but I only have her first name and the name of the city where she lives so it's a long shot. What can I do? Please. It's tearing me apart.

akoo8q,I [24F] Feel guilty for reporting my ex [25M],"Hi Reddit, I've recently had to report my ex for a crime, and I'm unsure as to whether I should continue to press charges as I feel so guilty. I don't know where else to turn.

My ex Rob and I have never had a particularly good relationship. We were together from when we were 16. At the start, it was a lovely teen romance, obsessed with each other, talking all day and night, never a part, you know how it usually is when you're 16!

As a bit of background, we had our first major fight when we were 18, he wanted to dump me to be single and experience true ""University life"". This was code for be single and do things single people do whilst at uni. We were on holiday the month before university was supposed to start, but by the end of the holiday, we decided to stay together, we lived about an hour away from each other. Two months later, and two months into university, I got dumped. I believe he had kissed a girl on a night out (though I never got proof) but whatever happened, it was enough to convince him he wanted to be single. So I let him go, fully believing that was the end and we'd part ways and come back together later. We were 18 after all. A week later, he says he regrets the decision, so we got back together but this is where all of our problems started.

We started to argue constantly, about anything and everything. Things looked dire, we couldn't go a week without an argument. I was convinced he was texting other girls when we weren't together (As when we were together, names I didn't know would pop up on his phone when we were) Or that I was always making the effort to come see him, and he wouldn't ever make the effort for me.

To make a long story short, we broke up, we got back together, he cheated and as a result, I tried to commit suicide as I was so depressed. I was honestly devastated. He was the only person I ever cared about, he was my entire future, and he treated me like a disposable being. He never seemed apologetic for his actions, he would only say sorry and that he's devoid of emotion, that he doesn't feel like he cares about me or anyone. My most vivid memory from that time was me in the hospital, crying down the phone begging him to come see me, but he refused.

Despite all this, a year later, we were back together. Trust me, I know i was stupid and weak. I should've said no but i wanted to believe it could work. Sadly, things didn't get better. We moved into together, but the fights were still there, now there was physical violence.

8 months into the relationship, I found out he was cheating again so I ended it for good. I packed up all my shit, moved out, got another job in another place far away from all of this shit.

I felt so relieved, like I was finally making the right choice. He would still harass me via messages, threatening to hurt me or my family, I told myself not to stand for it anymore and after blocking him, I decided to call the police. I'm so grateful to them. They took me very seriously and took my account and passed it onto the relevant force.

An officer called me up today, and asked me if I wanted to change my account into a statement, to try to get him convicted. I'm not sure. I feel incredible guilt. He hasn't contacted me since this happened (2 weeks ago) and im fairly sure he's with someone else now.. but I know what a conviction will do to him. It would ruin his career, dreams, aspirations, potentially his life. Do I want that? I have until the end of today to give the officer an answer. I have no idea what to do. I could honestly cry at the thought of having to go to court, and see his hateful eyes beaming down at me.

Sorry for the huge paragraph,

Tonight I'm on my own while my partner is out with his friends. I have sent a message to the one friend and person I know who he is intimidated by to back off to help me. Hopefully he will, I just know that if this person even comes to take me away my partner will back off.

But while I'm alone tonight is there anything I should be doing? Packing a secret bag? Trying to reach out to people he said I can't talk to on a private account, like make a new secret account.

akttfr,Really need help,"First post to reddit. Not sure what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just got off the phone with my mother, who was violently sobbing over the phone. My father has bipolar disorder, which has only recently gotten pretty bad. I am in my early twenties, and his disease only really emerged about a decade or so ago, but has gotten progressively worse. My mother has never reported any physical abuse (nor have I seen evidence of anything), but the emotional abuse and controlling of my mother has started to get out of hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I graduated college, I moved home for a bit. During this time, he seemed to be ok. I am not sure if this was because I was home, and not working so I basically went everywhere with my mother. My mother says it is because I always stand up to him when he is acting out of line. I would never call myself uncontrollable, but I have been known to, especially when I was a teenager, disregard attempted rules or punishments my father has tried to set. Regardless, I found a job a couple months out of college and moved to a city a couple of hours away, so now I only go home on the random weekend or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I have moved out, my mother seems to be having a really difficult time. He has been getting paranoid, accusing her of going out and cheating on him whenever she leaves to run errands like do groceries or laundry. My mother has told me that he has shown up at the laundromat a couple of times trying to track her down when he thinks she's out with men. He has been out of a job for almost a year now, and my mother still has little kids at home, so she has been trying to supplement her income by driving for apps. He now forbids her from doing this, creating an extra strain on their finances (which he does not have access to due to a reoccurring drug problem). He does not allow her to see her friends, nor does he even really allow her to speak on the phone. Even when she calls me, he tells her to hang up. On top of it all, he constantly puts her down, telling her she is stupid (maybe not blatantly, but definitely speaks to her in a condescending manner with that implication). He tells her that she is actually the crazy one, and that she turns his kids against her. I know she has been trouble sleeping due to stress.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother will never divorce him or anything of that sort. In the past, he has complained of ""voices"" telling him he would kill himself, so this is a real concern of all of ours, as we do love him. He is our father after all. His brother similarly has severe mental illness (history of family abuse from their father, my grandfather), and has had episodes where he has attempted suicide. I do not necessarily know if something like divorce would do any good, and as I have mentioned, I have young siblings that still live at home, who are my greatest concern. My oldest brother and I are lucky in that we at least saw my parents when they were happy, but still, neither of us have remained unaffected. I would like to limit any stress/trauma this may cause my youngest siblings. I have no idea what I, as their daughter, can do, or even whether or not it is my place. Any advice would be welcomed.

aky5vp,Does anyone else here feel dead inside? (trigger warning),"Okay, this may sound crazy, but I want to say this is not something I exactly believe literally.

Sometimes I feel convinced that I'm a ghost or something, that my father or my ex-boyfriend killed me a long time ago (the latter nearly did) or that I've killed myself already in a suicide attempt (several nearly did). It feels like I'm just wandering the earth doing stuff like a normal human, but I'm not supposed to be here and I'm not like other people, who are mostly fine.

I also feel like a robot sometimes, like a machine that just spits out canned answers that sort of seem like something I would have said before I got even more messed up from the battering (""I'm fine; how are you?""), or a paper cutout of a human, or a golem just doing the same small tasks mindlessly every single day for no reason. 

I do stuff and I can feel real joy sometimes, but I feel a lot of the time like I don't belong here, I don't belong with other people, I've been made different from them somehow (in a bad way--like corrupted, broken, and stripped of the good parts of being a person), and I shouldn't be alive. Escaping from my DV situation was like busting out of a torture facility or something, and I didn't really (don't really) feel like anyone cared much (my family ignored it and refused to call even the beating ""abuse"", friends and therapists could be awkward), so the whole thing feels also unreal, like it happened in another dimension. It really makes all this alien-ghost-robot stuff feel extra bad because I can't even tell anyone why I'm like this and have them fully understand or care.

I don't know. I guess this is why I can't spend very long in social gatherings any more, lol. I used to be shy but now I just look around at all the normal humans, think about how to answer when people ask me what I've been doing for the last X years, and go home in about 10 minutes.

al02dl,"I've spent the first few years of my twenties battling my ex in court after my assaults, and I'm getting so tired","I'm so fucking tired of the court process in my state, and how lenient they treat criminals here. I'm exhausted that this has gone on even longer than the relationship even lasted. I'm so tired of not feeling safe. 

I posted here a few months ago about how my ex violated my Protection Order for the third time. The first few violations, he couldn't be prosecuted because the evidence got either lost or not kept track of properly. This was the first violation in which I gathered photographic evidence right before I called security at my school. 

It seemed so clear-cut to me and the prosecutors who were in charge of the case. They didn't seem perturbed in the slightest, and my ex's aggressive lawyer made him look worse. It got to the point where the prosecutor was almost giddy with amusement and said that his lawyer was handling the job for him. The judge spent most of the case berating my ex over the agreement we made in the past, and you could see my ex floundering over trying to explain. 

It was so obvious to everyone in the room that he violated it, but in the end the judge suddenly withdrew and said that he had to ""toe the line"" and she wouldn't rule it as a probation violation. The gust immediately left the prosecutor's sails. I felt numb. My friend, who'd watched the whole thing skeptically, was as much for a loss of words as I was. It felt like such a slap in the face that I ignored posting an update here because I was so wounded by it. 

Now, I have court again this week to discuss the second charge brought by that incident. Apparently the first case was determining if it was a probation violation, and this new court case will determine if he broke the rules of the Protection Order. From what the new prosecutor said, the cases are independent from each other and won't effect one another, but I'm still worried. His lawyer already submitted documents stating this court case doesn't need to happen since the first case decided to keep his probation intact, and they've reassured me that isn't allowed. But I feel so disheartened. For the first time in the years of court dates I've gone to, this was the first time I felt like I wasn't believed and it was heart-wrenching. He walked away getting to feel like the victor in the last case, as if he did nothing wrong. 

I'm so scared about this new court case. His lawyer yells at me and insults me every single time we have court and tries to throw me on the defense even though his own client is the one responsible for what happened every single time. I'm so tired. I have debilitating acne scars all over my face from the stress of getting assaulted for 9 hours. Before I met him I had smooth, clear skin. I can't stand looking at myself in the mirror and I'm so tired of dealing with my ex. At this point, even despite the violations he's committed, he's still on track to get his record scrubbed clean of the felony and it is... numbing.",million_tiny_stars,2019-01-29 05:37:18,2,564,54.13,31.62,63.37,1,18.19,16.13,89.54,56.38,18.09,12.06,7.8,0.35,0.18,3.19,0.53,6.03,8.69,13.3,8.16,5.85,7.45,1.95,17.02,6.03,2.66,1.42,2.66,2.48,6.21,1.06,4.96,0.53,2.48,0.71,7.8,0,0.18,0.18,3.01,10.82,3.01,1.77,1.24,1.95,1.6,3.19,3.37,1.24,0.71,1.42,2.66,0.89,1.6,0.18,0,9.4,1.06,2.13,4.08,1.24,1.42,8.87,6.91,0.35,13.48,0.89,5.32,6.91,1.42,0.18,0.18,0.35,0,0,1.06,0.18,0,0,0,0,13.83,5.67,3.19,0,0,0,0,0.35,0.35,4.26,0,0

al5j5v,Short survey to help promoting support programs for domestic violence survivors,"Hi everyone:

We are 2 students in our Master of Public Policy program, we are taking the course ""Changing Social Behavior"" this quarter, and our project is about domestic violence. We are trying to figure out why a lot people do not ask for help &amp; support when experienced physical violence, and how to help with that.

Here we have a short survey of 5 questions listed below, the survey is anonymous and we will not take any other information from your response/reddit ID or other things. You have the choice of responding in the comment area, or just send me a PM, anything works for you. 

SURVEY:

There are many local/national/international organizations and programs aiming to help survivors and sufferers from domestic violence, but they are poorly recognized, and many people don't turn to help when they suffer. So if you are a survivor/sufferer from domestic violence who didn't seek help from the supporting organizations/programs, or you are familiar with this community, can you think of: 

1. **“What are some of the reasons you haven’t done this or are unlikely to in the future?”** (Keep thinking until you can’t think of any other reasons)
2. **What can you imagine would be** ***in it for you*** **personally to do this?**
3. **What could someone** ***say to you*** **that would make it more likely you would?**
4. **What could someone** ***show you*** **that would make it more likely you would?**
5. **What could someone** ***give you*** **that would make it more likely you would?**

We appreciate your time and courage to response.

al8h66,My Brother Tried Breaking into My Parent's House,"So, my brother is extremely abusive. Growing up, he used to take his anger out on me by beating me up. When it first started happening, my parents tried to intervene and stop him but after a while, they just let it happen without stopping him. The abuse got so bad that he broke both of my arms and as a result, both my arms are hyperextended. I remember when I started school, my mom threatened that if I  told someone what was happening at home, something bad would happen to me, so I never did tell anyone. I now wish I did. He doesn't physically abuse me anymore but he is verbally and emotionally abusive. I'm in therapy right now for anxiety and depression as well as for trauma the abuse caused me. My parents are also verbally and emotionally abusive and to make matters worse, they will do anything to protect my brother from getting in trouble no matter what. I still live with my parents but I'm trying to get a job and move out but I've been struggling to find a job since I have no job experience.

My brother lives with my aunt and last night he got in a fight with her. He left her house and walked down to my parents house. My mom didn't want to let him inside so she locked the door. My brother smashed this window on the door to try to get in. There was glass everywhere and it was extremely frightening. I asked my mom if I should call the police and she said if I did, not only would I be kicked out but she would lie and say that I was the one who broke the window. One of the reasons why my parents are scared to get law enforcement involved with my brother is because he has autism and they are worried the cops would hurt him or my brother would try hurting himself. After he broke the window, my brother apologized for what happened and agreed to pay for the window. But my brother seems to not be able to comprehend how dangerous his actions were, he just says it was an accident. I was able to take a few pictures of the broken window and a few videos, in one of the videos I have my mom on camera saying she would lie to police and say I was the one who broke the window instead of my brother.

I am extremely scared right now. My brother's mental health is getting worse and I'm worried he may try hurting himself or someone else. My mom also said that a few days ago, he took 7 ibuprofen to try to stop his heart. My parents are trying to get him committed to a hospital but that might not happen. I told my therapist what happened and she said I should report what happened to a service called Crime Check which let's you report a crime that already occurred. I would call them but I'm scared that if my parents find out I would be kicked out and that my brother might try hurting himself, if he does hurt himself I worry they would blame it on me. Another reason why I'm afraid to call them is because my parents support me financially and are putting me through school, if I call  Crime Check I'm worried they would cut me off and I wouldn't be able to afford going to school by myself. My parents also have a will and I'm set to earn a large amount of money when they die, if I report what happened I'm worried I would be cut out of it, but at this point I'm debating if I even care about being cut out of it anymore since I'm afraid for my safety. 

What happened has made my anxiety worse and I'm extremely scared my brother might try doing something worse like hurting himself or someone else. I have no one I can stay with either unless I want to go down to a domestic violence shelter and to make matters worse, I'm 20 and don't even know how to drive unless I want to take an Uber but I'm worried that if I try my parents might cancel the ride or their card. 

I have no idea what I should do and if I should call Crime Check. Should I get a plan in place in case they kick me out? Should I try telling others what's going on such as family member? I'm just worried that if I told another family member and they told my parents about it, my parents will just deny what happened and I would get kicked out.",spazmcgee1,2019-01-29 19:28:13,1,804,16.74,31.39,44.37,1,22.97,15.67,95.4,61.57,23.88,18.28,12.69,0.12,0.12,3.98,1.37,5.6,4.1,12.06,11.19,4.73,9.2,1.62,22.51,3.86,1.62,2.49,1,1.12,7.09,0.62,6.47,2.24,1.24,1.37,13.81,4.23,0,1.62,4.73,13.93,1.12,1.99,4.23,4.73,0.87,4.6,2.11,0.37,0.87,0.75,1.37,0.37,1,0,0,11.32,3.86,2.24,1.74,1.87,1.87,6.09,12.31,1.49,9.95,1.37,5.22,3.48,1.99,0.5,1.87,0.37,0,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0.12,0,9.58,3.98,2.49,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,2.86,0,0
alaiz8,Struggling now that I’m out,"I met him when I was sophomore in college. At the time my son was 18 months and I was recovering from an abusive relationship with my child’s father. I was very isolated, and he was my salvation. He became a huge part of me&amp;my sons life. For a time my son called him dad. We have spent almost everyday with each other since meeting(6 years). Our relationship was incredibly violent. At first I shared with some close friends but after getting back together with him enough times the abuse became our secret. My son has seen the most, and while I would never want to admit to what he’s seen, it’s just the tip of the iceberg. The last time I saw him, he strangled me and stopped only after saying he controlled whether I lived or died. He then walked through my apartment and broke my work laptop, my personal laptop, and my cell phone. Compared to his other episodes-it was very mild. The police have been called in the past. This is the first time I’ve sought them out. The detective I’m working with is really nice. But even now, I cannot being myself to speak about some of the things that have occurred while we were together. I’m lonely and depressed. I haven’t told anyone about my pending legal action because is promised them I’d been done with a while ago. I want him back and to make these feelings disappear. I know I cannot trust him. He hasn’t even ever reached out to apologize. My son has expressed relief in his absence. I have continued to press charges because I know it’s the right thing to do. But at night, when I’m alone in bed I’m realize how much I’m really struggling. I really miss him but I know he will hurt me if I go back.

albsvl,First time poster. Had a nightmare last night that my abusive ex was chasing me. Worst dream I've had in a while. (Trigger warning),"First time post here, very new to this sub. Writing thus om mobile so apologies if the formatting is bad, I'll do my best.

So recently I was talking to my boyfriend about what one of my exes actually did the time that he really hurt me. It's not the worst thing, I've known many people have way worse so I'm not saying it's the worst but I never thought of it as genuine violence/abusive behaviour. That may sound weird, I just don't know how to explain it any better. 

What basically happened was we were lying next to each other at a friend's house on his bed, he punched me really hard on my upper arm_/shoulder, I said it didn't hurt (for some reason, not provoking) so he grabbed me and pulled me closer and punched me loads harder, many times. 

Anyways last night I had a pretty intense dream, triggered by discussing that event as well as watching 2 pretty heavy tv shows. The whole dream I was running from my ex knowing he was going to beat the shit out of me. He never got to me and hurt me in the dream but the absolute fear definitely was. 

Just a vent, Hope this is allowed. Any feedback/comments/advice etc welcome.

aldqvn,I’m [23F] leaving my girlfriend [45F] who is bipolar and manipulative.,"(Post was removed from r/relationshipadvice)

So I finally build up the courage to break up with her. We’ve had our differences and I feel it’s best to go separate ways. She’s bipolar and mostly acts like a teenager, which of course is no problem since I’m just 23. But I can’t shake the feeling of some of the things she’s done. 

A little backstory. I’ve met my girlfriend through my mother, they were best friends. We planned a holiday to my second hometown in Lisbon and I asked if she wanted to be my girlfriend. 
We were happy go lucky and everything was great. 
I did tell her that I wanted to go back home to my mom after the vacation but she said that I could move in right away because she didn’t want to miss me. (Classical lesbian move. I know) 

I was a little sceptical since I told her I wanted to take it slow. I also told her that if she wanted to be my girlfriend that we would make a child together since I have that wish. That resulted in her buying me an engagement ring after 2 months, buying me all this stuff that I wanted (and needed). I was already startled by her buying an engagement ring but I thought what the hell, this is something for in the future. 

On New Year’s Eve we went to a nice hotel in the center of Holland (the country where we live) and she had booked this beautiful hotel. We were together for five months so I thought is was really nice. When we entered the room I saw champagne and roses on the bed. I jokingly said :’if I didn’t know better I would figure you’re going to ask if I’ll marry you’. She was acting weird about it so I said :’... if you’re asking me to marry you I will say no now, it’s too soon’. 

This caused her to break down and break up with me. I was fine with it since I was having doubts about the way she fought with me. She was always threatening to break up and whenever I said that I wanted to go back to my mom for a week, she always said that if I do that I could stay there. But after that night she said that she didn’t want to break up and wanted to do things differently. I agreed and proceeded with the relationship. 
Since that moment I feel nothing when we kiss or made love. I feel very guilty about it and this has been going for a month already. I just hoped that the feeling would come back. It never did. I also don’t want to waste my time. 

Last Sunday we had an argument about whatever. I again told her that I wanted to go to my mother to think about things. And of course she manipulated me in staying by saying it would be over then. The fact that I didn’t get my space caused me in thinking: I feel it’s better if we’re done. 

I know have written a letter about my feelings and that I’m telling her that we are over and that I hope she gets all the love and attention in the world. She really is great but I can’t handle her bipolar disorder. She’s not just her disorder but it’s just too much for me. 

Now I’m scared of how she will react. Sometimes when she gets mad she starts throwing stuff and I’ve been abused in my previous relationship. I don’t want that to happen again. My girlfriend hit me once and it really triggered me. I told my mom about what’s going on so that if she hears nothing that she will call me. 

If anybody has any advice on how I can handle this situation the best, that would be great!

TLDR; breaking up with my girlfriend who has an bipolar disorder and manipulated me in staying with her 

Edit: English is not my first language. 

Double edit: I live with her. Also when I tried to break up with her earlier she said that I needed to give back everything she ever gave.",tantetruus95,2019-01-30 07:27:27,2,716,12.36,51.12,69.28,49.14,15.23,11.73,96.51,64.25,27.37,19.55,11.73,1.82,0.56,5.31,0.14,7.82,4.19,12.57,10.47,6.7,7.26,2.09,22.35,3.49,1.54,1.96,0.98,0.84,5.45,3.35,2.09,0.84,0.98,0.14,16.06,0.98,0.98,6.15,0,15.08,2.23,2.51,4.75,2.79,1.54,4.19,2.93,0.28,1.68,0.98,1.26,0,0.84,0.14,0,9.22,4.33,1.26,2.79,1.82,0.42,8.66,11.03,1.68,15.92,2.79,6.28,6.98,0.98,0.7,0.42,0.42,0.14,0,0.42,0.14,0.28,0,0,0,14.94,6.7,0.98,0.7,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,4.47,1.12,0.7

alhd6i,I (16f) was abused during my long distance relationship with my ex-boyfriend (19m) and it put me in a facility.,"hi this story is really long. im sorry. also, forgive me if i repeat certain points. this is just a massive brain dump for me and i have a serious memory issue.

my name is odie (oh-dee)

wow.

where the hell do i even start? i guess i'll give a little background.

we started dating october 13, 2017. he lived all the way in bournemouth, uk, and i live in texas. he WAS a professional soccer player although he wasn't on the first team (he was on the youth team.) a boy i fell in love with. he had many many many issues. awful childhood, moved from house to house, dad died, brothers were dicks to him, etc. he was very unstable, but i did my very best to always be there for him when he needed me to be. he didn't eat much, got very little sleep. 5 hours of sleep max.

i became obsessive, and so did he, but of course i was so blinded by love, i didn't realize how unhealthy it was. we began talking 24/7. LITERALLY. we slept on the phone, i woke up for school the next morning, we'd talk while i was getting ready, i'd go to school, text him ALLLL day, went to cheer practice, came home, called him, repeat. this went on for almost a year. but then i noticed changes in his mood and attitude towards me. he became very short tempered. always yelling at me for small things like turning the mic off when he was sleeping because i didnt want to bother him (because he never gets sleep.) and then i noticed that he hasn't been leaving the house. so i asked him about soccer. he told me that he was fired for being injured and showing up to practice late or tired. (i later found out that he lied to me about that. what actually happened was he started showing up to practices extremely tired and wasn't giving his best effort. his coach asked him about it and he told him that he had ""met a girl in texas."" his coach basically told him he was going to have to choose between soccer and i. he chose soccer. and i have always hated his ass for it. after we split, he would blame me for it. that i ""ruined his career."" and shit.)

he became manipulative. but i thought it was cute that he was protective.

he didn't like my mom. at first he did. but then she heard me masturbating on the phone with him (i'm not going to lie- im here to get feedback and advice. might as well start with honesty) around our six months. after that, she couldn't trust us to be alone. we weren't allowed to sleep on the phone or even talk for as long as we used to be able to. and that pissed him the fuck off.

i love my mom. she just wants me to be appropriate and make good decisions. i respect her and always will respect my mother. she busts her ass for me to be healthy and successful, and i am so grateful.she always wants me to be better than her. she lost her virginity at 15. and she wishes she hasn't. i never considered her being a parent (and her discipline style) as abusive or controlling. but my boyfriend thought otherwise.

he started making me feel like shit daily. he would tell me that my mom is controlling and abusive. i didn't want to believe it. but he would always get so angry at me. and i hate when people get angry at me and yell. it makes me extremely upset, and he knew that from the very beginning.

he would tell me constantly that i needed to be more assertive and aggressive and that i shouldn't let her yell at me and control my life like that. he would get angry when i told him i didn't want to do it because

1. i knew i'd get my ass beat and ytf would i want to get myself in trouble ??
2. i wouldn't be allowed to talk to him anymore
3. it would hurt me to treat my mom that way because she is my mother and i respect her

and one day, it did happen. beginning of september.

i felt like if i didn't say something, i would lose my relationship. and i didn't want that. but i also knew that i was ruining the relationship with my mother as well, and the trust she has with me.

i walked in her room and told her she wasn't going to control my life. anddddd it led to a whole ass argument and ended with me walking to school and her begging me, yelling at me to get into her car (this was all before i had to go to school. and dw, i didn't have to walk far. the school is behind my house across the highway.)

later that night i ended up calling him and trash talking him in front of my mom lol and he tries to EXPOSE ME BECAUSE HE KNOWS MY MOM IS RIGHT THERE. so he talks about how gOdlY i act and how i talk shit about my mum all the time and etc. i end up hanging up.

okay so fast forward- i get my door taken off, my mom and step-dad take a 4 week break (this will be relevant later), no phone, no anything. my mom convinces me for a short period of time that he is toxic blah bla blah yeah.

well THAT DIDN'T WORK.

the moral of the story is, mother knows  best. ALWAYS. please believe me this time.

i talked to him again. and we kept our relationship a secret.

i found out soon after that he had attempted suicide by taking pills and was in the hospital.

i started talking to him while he was in the hospital, mid-sept. and we talked up until oct.31.

he was discharged from the hospital early to mid october.

during that time, we were off and on. he was angry at me because i turned on him and shit talked him the night i blew up on my mom. because he said i betrayed him. which, i did. and i take responsibility for that completely. it was wrong of me. but also, i felt so pressured and i felt like what he was telling me to do was my only option to save that relationship.

our secret relationship was god awful. he would bring up many many things that happened in the past. such as betraying him (mom situation), talking to other guys on my snapchat (we weren't officially dating. we were just flirting with eachother and i didn't even consider it to be serious), and also saying how i lied saying i never sent pictures before. ok i didn't tho. i only ever sent nudes to him, but what the fuck ever. he always stretched situations because he was addicted to conflict because he didn't have anything better to do because he didn't have a job.

because we were on and off mid-sept - oct 31, i went to homecoming with another boy. it wasn't very serious. he asked me to homecoming and i said yes. i lowkey wanted to distract all negative thoughts because i wanted to have at least one night that i could relax and have fun. it wasn't a romantic night. it was fun. i didn't have to worry about where my boyfriend was at because i didn't have one. but of course he ended up finding out i went to homecoming with another boy and that's how i was nicknamed whore and slut by the boy i once believed i was gonna marry SKKSKS hahaAHAHAH.

then forward, it was god awful. and i don't blame him. i did make a few mistakes that i do regret now. because although we weren't together, i should have been smart about it, and i wasn't. it was something new everyday. he would intentionally find reasons to degrade me and make me feel like shit. he even pressured me into publicly announcing that the things i had said about him to other people and on social media (during our time apart) were only for attention and to display him as a fucking cunt. which is COMPLETELY false. i said those things because i want to bring awareness to the issue of teen relationship abuse (even though the situation had barely started, and it was nowhere near as bad as it gets.) he blamed me for his suicide attempted as well. i blamed it all on myself. i apologized over and over again. i felt so shameful. that i made a person feel like shit, they feel like they no longer can live.

it got really bad really quickly. i started having extreme suicidal thoughts. i really struggled with self-harm and had frequent anxiety attacks.

because what the hell was i supposed to do? i wanted to end my life and i couldn't tell my mom because i wasn't supposed to be talking to him and if she found out, she would take away all my shit forever.

so i cried.i cried and i cried and cried. i begged for him to forgive me of all the things i've ever done. i did everything i could to get him to stop screaming at me and degrading me. i went as far as holding up a knife to my throat and having a meltdown episode. (which by the way, he has on recording and he has threatened me so many times with it- but we will get to that.) he called me fucking filthy, a slut, a whore, he told me i don't deserve to be alive, he told me that he hopes someone abuses me so i can ""feel the pain i've caused him.""

October 31, 2018

I get a call 3 am. and that night was the night i decided it was time for me to end my life. an hour and a half i dreaded. i never cried so hard in my entire life. my voice was raspy and my throat hurt after the call ended. it was the loneliest i had ever felt. i didn't want to text my friends because they told me all the time i deserved so much better and i never listened. i didn't want it to be a ""told you so"" moment for me. so i kept to myself.

i never went back to sleep. i sat in my room in the dark. my thoughts were racing and i was a whole mess. that night was probably the most mentally unstable i've ever been. it was the lowest point i've ever reached. i wasn't sure if i could go to school or not, but i knew that if i stayed home, i wouldn't be able to make it through the whole day without driving myself insane.

this entire time, my mom, stepdad, and dad knew absolutely nothing about this. they had no idea any of this was going on. so going to school a wreck and having to call my mom mid first period and tell her i was having suicidal thoughts was absolutely terrifying. my school counselor sent me home. my step-dad spent all day trying to find therapists for me when they came across an OP facility near me. i went to get evaluated to see what kind of treatment was best for me, and they said that PHP was the best option for me.

PHP = partial-hospitalization program. which basically is a hospital program but instead of it being overnight, you go home during the day.

i was scared. im not going to lie. i didnt know what to expect and i wasn't familiar with mental health.

to sum up my experience at the op facility- i was in the faith based group. i was with about 6-8 other people. but teens were constantly discharging, so making friends and watching them leave was hard. i got the help i needed during treatment, but i could also help others with theirs. i learned new coping skills and habits. and i discharged the facility on Dec. 20.

during that time, i had multiple meltdowns. throwing things, screaming, crying. i hope it never gets that bad again.

but you know what never went away?

the fucking thought of him seeing me somehow.

he was messaging my mom all throughout my treatment. calling her a bitch, cunt, liar, etc.

then he started messaging me, when i got my phone back. he made seven new accounts on instagram to harass me. i've changed instagram accounts three times. didn't even go by the same name. he's tried logging into my email accounts. he had access to my spotify account and wiped all of my songs. because he knows how much i love music. he even logged into my fortnite account and removed all of my friends &amp;amp; friend requests. he's had people send me messages, threatening me and saying awful things. he even went as far as sending me the video of me holding the knife up to my throat when i was having a meltdown otp with him.

he still harasses me today. the last i've heard from him was about a week and a half ago. he messaged me and told me to stop wearing the adidas joggers he sent to me. so he knows what i wear now. there's moles in my snapchat. he also knows the names of my friends, their social media accounts, my family's names, my address, where i work, what my phone number is, my email accounts, where i go to school.

and i know most people are just going to say ""just block him"" ""just ignore him""

it's not that simple. it's not that fucking simple.

and i do ignore him, i don't reply.

but when you're constantly being harassed and stalked, it's hard to just ignore what he says.

i can block every account he creates to harass me, but he still gets his message across.

and it's becoming easier to just not to actually take in what he's saying to me. but this shit is so hard.

i went on a date with a boy two weeks ago. he's very kind and patient with me because he knows what i'm currently going through. well, we kissed. and when i pulled back, he asked me why i was shaking. he could literally feel me shaking.

i just hate how this stupid fucking dickhead has literally consumed me. i don't even feel like the same person anymore.

i've been diagnosed with PTSD, and i have a neurologist appointment soon to look further into my memory issues.

i'll end my story here.

all70l,A different kind of post.,"Hi everyone. I apologize in advance if this post is not appropriate for this subreddit, but I felt this was the best place for me to start due to the anonymity.

I am a graduate student seeking my Master's in school counseling/marriage and family therapy, and I'm currently enrolled in a domestic violence/ intimate partner violence course this semester where we learn how to support and work with survivors of DV. I'm reaching out to see if anyone would be willing to share their experience, which should entail telling me your story (as much or little as you want) and answering a few follow up questions (only questions you feel comfortable with). I intend to honor the anonymity that reddit provides, and we would only communicate via direct messages through reddit. For our class, we are asked to share what we learned from our interview, but I would not share any identifying information. Additionally, I intend to get rid of this account when the interview is over to insure confidentiality.

So sorry for the long post. Thank you in advance to anyone who is comfortable enough to share their story. To anyone who is going through or has gone domestic violence, know that there are people to support you. If you need someone to talk to, call the National Domestic Hotline at 1-800-799-7233. 💜",mygradschoolaccount,2019-01-30 19:22:50,0,231,64.94,91.69,54.29,80.64,19.25,24.24,91.34,53.25,17.75,10.82,4.76,2.6,2.6,0,0.87,6.93,4.33,16.02,6.93,3.03,7.36,0.87,14.72,4.76,1.73,3.03,1.73,1.3,6.93,4.76,1.73,0,0,0.43,18.61,0.87,0.43,0,0,15.58,4.33,1.3,3.9,5.63,0.43,4.33,1.73,0.43,0,0.87,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,12.12,6.93,2.6,2.6,2.16,0,2.16,13.42,0.43,12.12,2.16,6.49,2.16,5.19,1.3,1.73,0.43,0,0,0.87,0,0.87,0,0,0,14.29,5.19,3.9,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,1.3,1.73,0.87
allhpv,Any advice on how to leave?,"I (32f) have been with my boyfriend (40m) for 12 years. We have a very crazy relationship and four years ago I decided to leave. Before then I wanted to leave but didn't know I could. 

I quit my job for him within the first two years of our relationship. I got a new job four years ago and had the money and resources to leave. I let him talk me out of working and I spent all my money on bills and now I have $5,000 in debt. 

My new job doesn't pay very well and I've been trying to get a better paying job but nothing is coming through. 

Tonight we had a bad fight. He quit being physically violent a few years ago. But he is constantly yelling and threatening me. Tonight he decided to fight with me over sex. I lost it and started posting his insults to me on his instagram page. 

He freaked out and kicked me out of the house. I called the police because he took all my car keys and wouldn't give them back. He decided while I was on the phone with 911 to give me my keys.  I took our daughter and got in the car. Sat outside thinking about what to do. He called and asked me to come back. 

I would have gone to a hotel but its 2 degrees out and snowing. He talked me in to buying a stupid sports car that doesn't handle well in the snow. The closest hotel is 1 mile away and the roads were slippery and I just knew a car accident would happen. So I went back. 

Right now with all my debt and only $150 in my checking account I honestly don't know where I can go.  Except to family and they all have kids. I don't want to be a burden when they already have their own stuff.

alturu,"Trying to get out of an abusive marriage, any advice?","Together 4 years, married March 2018 and moved into an apartment together May  2018. He is a 100% disabled veteran who has PTSD, TBI, and bipolar disorder. We have been through couples therapy, retreats, and medications (I'm also his caretaker for the VA). I've sincerely tried to get him all the help he needs and thought (maybe naively) that all he needed was someone to love, care, and support him. While not going into  too many details an event happened last night that turned physical with  him locking me out of the car and trying to drive off while I was in   front of it while holding my things hostage. This is not the first  physical incident as he slapped me in November because I wouldn't go out in the snow to get him a sandwich. He has refused to take his medications since September and I can tell he is going through the start of a bipolar hypermanic episode.

I've been staying at my Mom's since December and I want to leave but am unsure how to fully proceed. I do not have much money, we do not have  children, and I do not want anything from him. I simply want to get my stuff from the apartment and cut ties. But I'm not sure if I should file  for separation or go for a straight no-fault divorce. Frankly, I'm not even sure how he would take being served divorce papers because he is in a state where it's impossible to reason with him. So I'm trying to figure out if maybe it would be cheaper, a bit easier, and still legally wise to get a legal separation first then file for divorce after the  year is up?

What we have together: I pay the rent, the lease is up in June. We do not have any joint bank accounts. I have a credit card under his account as an authorized user (I'm planning to take my name off and get my own). And I do get paid by  the VA for being his caretaker (not sure how to deal with this just  yet). My name is also on the electric bill (but I figure I could just call the company to take it off).

On another note, I recently also found out I have a rare disease and I might have to undergo chemo for it. I was going to use this as an excuse  to move back to my Mom's place by saying she would take care of me (he's lazy so he has not taken care of me or even offered since I found  out about the disease). I don't want to let him know I'm leaving him and  then have him try to retaliate. Also before getting married, I loaned  him 4k to pay off his debt. He promised to pay me back but is refusing  now of course. I'm figuring there isn't much I can do to try to get it  back and should just take it as a loss? I'm also trying to figure out the cheapest way to move my stuff out (unfortunately, I don't think I know anyone willing with a van).

alzmi0,He killed her but I cant prove it,Hi all. I'm here on behalf of my friend who passed away last weej. She is my childhood best friend. Her family has told me she was in an abusive relationship. Her boyfriend controlled everything about her life and when she would resist he would force feed her pills. Several of her friends have stated this. The boyfriend is rumored to also be a drug dealer thus easy access to the pills. My friend got a tox report upon her death which revealed an insane amount of drugs. The me has ruled her death an overdose. She is not nor has even been a habitual drug user. The boyfriend has taken her possessions and the state is stonewalling us. They say this is a civil matter now as her death doesnt indicate fowl play. We are stuck now because without further investigation to prove her drug history is clean the state wont listen to us as we beg them to think otherwise.  I want to help my friend. I want the truth to come out. I have no idea where to start. We are considering the private lab hair testing to demonstrate timeline. Our financial resources are limited. Any input helps and I'll happily answer questions as this is quite complicated.

am5inm,"I don’t know if any of this counts as physical abuse, but it scared me and I need it off my chest.","I’m 20, boyfriend is 21. Dating for about a year. 

When we first started dating, he one time choked me during sex. I said it was ok and I liked it in context, but not too often. Eventually it stopped all together during sex.

However, he now uses it outside of sex and it’s scaring the shit out of me.

Here’s two examples:

1) we were watching tv and he said “this is boring, where’s the action” I jokingly said “don’t be a little bitch, just be patient”. He then proceeded to choke me really really hard and said “oh? Who’s the little bitch now?” 

A few days later I brought it up and said it kind of scared me, because it was totally out of the blue. He said it was my fault because I said it was okay during sex and that he “knew this would happen.” 

2) I sometimes talk loud when I get excited. We were in my apartment and he told me to “shhh”. I said, “hey, I don’t like to be shushed like a toddler.” He then grabbed me by my neck while choking me and slammed me on the bed and made me say I wouldn’t talk back.

I’m too scared to say I didn’t like it. I don’t know if it’s sexual to him, but he didn’t try to initiate sex after either time he choked me so it scares me.

I tried posting in r/relationships but they deleted my post and asked that I post here, so I’m sorry if this doesn’t fit. I don’t mean to offend anyone by classifying this as something it’s not.

amb55u,The truth...,"Abuse is not only black and white with bruises up and down and black eyes.

Abuse is a girl cutting all her hair off after 7 yrs of growing it so, you can no longer snatch her up by it. 

Abuse is being afriad to sleep even when shes tired, out of fear of hot coffee being purposely dumped on her bc your mad she was laying down. 

Abuse is the tiny bleeding cuts and teeth shaped bruises inside her mouth from being hit and her mouth held shut forcefully. 

That girl with a broken windshield? Thats not from a deer, thats from being forced to drive her abuser places while hes fighting but this time, luckily, he beat the car instead of her for once. 

Abuse is the girl covered in her own blood but having to rock her child to sleep first before she can even go try to clean herself up. 

Abuse is a deformed lip with no muscle in it or feeling cuz its already been head butted out of her. 

Abuse is being afraid to give anyone your glasses even the eye dr to check bc your afriad you wont get them back from the times your abuser took them so you couldnt defend yourself or see or leave. 

Abuse is being slammed into a fridge and choked until the black starts filling your eyes.
Abuse is also being stripped of your clothing and thrown out in the snow naked after being strangled. But the police see ""no marks"" so nothing comes of him strangling you. 

Abuse is your child being held from you, manipulated and told lies or custody threatened even though your completely competent and a good mother. 

Abuse is the car that just drove by blaring the horn except its not her doing it, its him leaning over and doing it for funsies. 

Abuse is involving the police over and over when hes completely out of control, wishing they would do something but bc hes related to the squad, you get threatened to get arrested. But the last time he got out in a day and only had a short stent of probation. 

Abuse is a girl always having a new purse, cuz the last one got torn apart cuz you tried to leave again. Or new glasses cuz he broke them.

Abuse is all his shit friends defending him and taking up for him all the while telling you that doctors lie and arent always right when you have to go get 6 stitches to put your mouth back together again. 

Abuse is a shitty family sticking up for him and victim blaming bc the one time you got sick of his shit you scratched his poor face. 

Abuse is having a miscarriage from the stress of fights, with no help, passing out in your hallway without even a hand offered bc hes too busy yelling at you and being a dick. 

Abuse is doing every little thing, making sure the laundry is done, food is available, and hes got all his needs met but you still being the main problem and worthless. 

Abuse is hurrying to the store to replace your childs favorite toy because it got in your abusers path and he broke it to pieces. 

Abuse is being a pro at drywall and mudding because youve had to fix a million holes so your lease managers dont sue or fine you. 

Abuse is being told your a pos and cant handle being a mom or even a human when you reach out and ask for help with this or that or vent how much you have going on. 

Abuse is when all you say is okay or whatever when hes all riled up spouting bs words and screaming at the top of his lungs and still being grabbed and hit. 

Abuse isnt always visable. It doesnt look like bruises on a bicep from being grabbed, it isnt a black eye... Abuse is sometimes so much deeper then any of those things and sometimes even when there are marks, you cant see them. And the scariest part of abuse is you quit trying to reach out, you quit trying to find someone to talk to, you quit trying to find some help. You deal with it. Alone. Because it either gets gossiped about, turns into victim blaming or gets thrown in your face later on down the road.",xchantalb90x,2019-02-01 21:24:24,9,741,44.35,90.69,13.71,1,21.79,11.74,91.9,57.62,14.57,10.66,0,0,5.26,4.72,0.67,3.91,6.07,13.63,10.39,5.13,10.12,2.43,19.43,3.78,1.35,1.21,0.94,1.89,8.64,0.94,7.69,0.81,5.26,0.54,15.25,0.4,0.27,2.7,2.7,11.61,0.54,2.56,0.67,3.1,2.02,4.18,2.97,1.75,0.4,0.81,4.45,3.37,1.08,0.27,0.27,9.45,1.21,1.75,4.99,1.89,0.67,3.24,9.85,0.54,15.11,2.43,7.42,5.53,0.81,0.54,0.54,0.54,0,0,2.02,0.67,1.35,0.13,0,0,8.1,4.99,2.7,0,0,0.13,0,0,0.27,0,0,0

ameq3q,I am confused about my past relationship and need peoples input,"&amp;#x200B;

 I am not going to give the details of the our fights due to this being a throwaway for a reason. I don' want people to think I am trying to explain my behavior away or victim blame and if you feel as though I am trying to do so let me know.  

It just seems like during our time together we fought a lot (creeping normalcy). The cycle could not be broken. Sure we made plans to fix things but then the cycle would just start anew. Throughout the relationship I never set her up for abuse or had a bad day at work and needed to use someone as a punching bag. Nor do I think I was trying to assert my dominance or other classic reasons for DV. If I was and I just didn't realize it, it was definitely not working in my favor.  

Our communication was out of whack. I was afraid of being assertive because I knew that would lead to her getting mad at me if what I had to say differed from what she believed or thought. She did not like compromise and for some reason arguments/conversations were only about winning them. I don't want to vilify her because I want some honest feedback here and am trying not to jade anyone.  I am not perfect and she had to have some viable reasons, at one time or another, to get mad at me, arguments happen in relationships I get that. I have come to realize I have the ability to make other people want to yell at me for multiple reasons. After all, I am no angel.

We were intoxicated during our first fight which didn't help. Our first and craziest fight began when she accused me of cheating. Broke my apple watch when she realized she couldn't get in because of a pass code and threw it. Tried to grab my phone out of my hand but only grasped my thumb. She wrenched on it which brought me to my knees and leaving my hand black and blue the next day. Then hit me again.  I chose to react, muscle memory kicked in and attacked her. A few days later she went to the hospital for the injuries I gave her and spent the night, I picked her up the next morning. Was the force I used excessive? Ya, I think that would be a fair assumption and believe me in telling you I went through legal ramifications later down the line for it. I think I deserved what I got and it has made me a better man (I never thought I would be thankful getting arrested). However, until the relationship finally ended I never considered anyone else at fault for the violence in the relationship except for me. After all I had been physical in instances during our relationship. I think taking responsibility for your actions is essential, it doesn't matter who starts it.  I am an abuser and have the capability to hit a woman. 

 Throughout the relationship she would reinforce the notion that it was all my fault, not just the violence but for other things as well.  I felt remorse for what I had done, I felt like a monster for hitting her, I have mental health issues and she always claimed that my anger was out of control. Something that made me feel even more worthless was the fact I was always the funny guy, I was always laughing even in the worst situations but that part of me had long disappeared. It felt like she kept a list of things I had done, said or failed to do in reserve for arguments or to get her way when she felt it had to happen. I can't tell you how many times an argument got heated and she grabbed her phone and threatened to call the cops and report me for that first fight, but you better believe that shit worked and I shut the fuck up and did what she wanted. In hindsight I wish I was arrested the day after that fight but instead I wanted to avoid being punished and chose to live in fear (up to one year in county jail for a class A, that's no joke). A little background on me, I have never been arrested before or had to step foot in front of a judge. The few people I have shared this brief overview with have been bewildered that I would not leave or she would not leave. 

The first time I tried to break up with her she stole some old pain killers I had and overdosed.  She made sure to party like a rock star and wash it down with alcohol. I was on the couch and she told me she was going to kill herself. I caught her with bottles of pills tucked away in her purse. (I put all my old medications in a box and every now and again I drop them off at the hospital for disposal. She had uppers and downers but seriously what was she going to do three bottles of fluoxetine). I had no idea what she had taken so I tried to get her to purge. She said that she only took two of the pain killers, I can confirm that was lie based on what happened later.  Asking her to leave was incredibly hard for me to do. I ended up carrying her to her car because she would not leave. I also made sure to get the six copies she made of my apartment key without permission back(she had more than six copies come to find out, she would not respect any sort of boundary and she made me feel rude for trying to put them up).  I was codependent at this point. I have seen my fair share carnage in the middle east, some of those guys were closer to me than family but I never cried when they went to the big PX in the sky. I cried non-stop curled up on the floor when she finally left. I had anxiety on steroids and just felt like my world was crashing down. I still to this day do not understand why I felt that way when I knew we had a toxic relationship.

 I received a call later that evening from her and immediately picked up, she drove her car off a 20ft embankment and the cops were on scene. I drove all the way out  there just to lie to the police so I could get her back to mi casa without getting her into trouble. I like to protect people, especially the ones I love. I still cant believe that the cops believed she was just tired, rural police crack me up sometimes. So from then on, she would threaten self harm when I even brought up the notion that I wanted out of the relationship. I knew she was Bipolar 2, abused marijuana and had mental health issues of her own to worry about so those are all factors I realized could be impacting her behavior on any given day. It didn't help that the pills she was getting from the VA she never took(non-compliant), she never even opened the bottles. Later I found out that her pill holder she carried around in her purse only contained things like muscle relaxers and pain killers she bought off ""friends"". She agreed to take all her medications if I gave them to her in the morning. I did that for about a week and then realized that its on her to take better care of herself not me.

 I like to think I was empathetic and understanding all the time but that would be a lie because I was a real asshole to her sometimes. Again, I am not an angel. I also remember being so angry with myself that I had wound up in a relationship like this. This has been my first and hopefully last DV type of relationship. I have had a few former relationships that were non-violent since getting out of the Corps. 

She was using self-harm, the fact I had no self-worth at that point so she would demean me into submission and threatening to send me to prison to become a felon for domestic violence as ammo to manipulate me. She demanded she be allowed to go through my phone, e-mails, texts. She cloned my data, still has all my important documents such as passport. I had no privacy. It was normal to me though. To be fair when things got bad I confessed that I was talking to my ex who lived a few states over. It wasn't right, I shouldn't of been talking to another woman while in a committed relationship no matter how bad it was going. She read all the texts I had sent and she was furious and I was apologetic, classic take me back abusive behavior on my part. That's when I fooled myself into thinking that I am actually going to give this relationship a try, I was naive and telling myself no way could it get any worse.

Then I found out she cheated on me with guy she met out clubbing with her friends. I have to admit I was surprised and devastated. Curiously, I wasn't violent. I was only ever violent when I was getting yelled at/cornered and there was a lot of confusion on my part. She apologized and I took her back. To be fair she wasn't going to let me break up with her. She would physically not leave my apartment and knew how to get me to bend my knee to her will so I just went with it. I still felt deeply in love with her but the relationship was comically toxic at that point. 

I sort of gave up arguing and did whatever she wanted to do, go where she wanted to go and put my life on hold. My grades were slipping and I was so close to the end of college that I compiled absurd amounts of unneeded pressure on myself to do well, that did not help with how I felt about my life.  We went wedding ring shopping soon after I found out she cheated on me and I accepted that fact that the rest of my life is going to be spent with someone that made me feel like shit. I remember thinking, ""How the fuck did I get here?"" 

She told me she knew how to push me over the edge and enjoyed doing so, the conviction she had when telling me that will be in my memories forever.   She knew how to get me to the point in which I may choose to use physical violence (being in emotional distress, feeling threatened, berated and anger will do that to a human, but still not a justification). I wish I was a monk or someone who could just sit there and take bullshit she dished out. I think part of what triggered me to get emotional amped up was she was so damn aggressive and in your face. Exactly like the fuckers in the military, the ones that sit on leatherneck and do nothing but yell, ya those guys. 

There are a variety of techniques we used to try and stop fights. I would call time outs when things were getting out of hand and we would separate and come back later when were calm. I am not making this shit up, she did not try and leave any situation at any point during the relationship. I think the defusing technique is to physically leave. I found out that is easier said then done because she would follow me. If I locked a door she would remove the lock and handle to continue her aggressive in your face argument. You think she went through all the trouble of removing a handle to have a calm assertive conversations? She didn't partake in assertive conversations. She never understood why I felt a certain way or tried to put herself in my shoes.  

I slapped her once, she was yelling when she was at my apartment and out comes the laundry list of things I have done wrong. I could hear my neighbors cough so I knew they were listening in if they were home. In hindsight, what kind of person would just be screaming in another person apartment, that's pretty weird to me and exhibits a lack of self control and care. I continually asked her to be quite, calm down or engage in an adult conversation but she was not having it and continued in her tantrum and I slapped her.  Not an excuse to use violence but fear of my neighbors hearing all the handpicked wrongs I had done to her shook me to my core. I had to see these people everyday I didn't want to air our dirty laundry. This became a pattern for her to come over and scream and eventually I lost the safety feeling of my own home. I was then afraid of going to my apartment for fear of running into one of my neighbors.

 I couldn't believe I slapped her, I thought I was over hitting her and this just reinforced the negative image I had of myself. The rest of the physical altercations were more justified I thought as the were not very violent. The first time I tackled her was when she was coming after me with a stun baton. Another was when she came after me with a screwdriver. Each time, after I tackled her to get the objects away from her control she immediately started to cry.  She was saying ""how could you do that or why are you so rough with me"" then I must be the asshole abuser type. I just accepted I had gone to far to remove the things she was going to use as weapons.  It just hurts me deeply to think of hurting her. 

She would use the most intimate things I had confided in her to try to hurt me. She called me weak for having anxiety when I was  around people, especially large groups, and giving speeches. I confided in her that these types of anxiety impacted me tremendously. That just made me super sad but it also gave me the terrible idea of sinking to her level. I was too chicken to bring out the big guns. I would never talk about how she was given up for adoption or things of that nature. That would be too cruel and I like to think I am an decent guy.

I wanted a relationship with a future and someone I could say ""I Love You"" to and mean it. I thought I was in love with her so when I hurt her I started to doubt who I was as a person. The mind games she could play made me believe what she wanted me to believe. She is good at manipulating to be sure. These thoughts were reinforced by her throughout the relationship. She was also controlling. I had to share my location on my Iphone at all times (I didn't have a problem with it but it seemed sort of a demanding request like I didn't have an option), cannot associate with co-workers after work for happy hour due to there being other women there (I have been the jealous type before so I get it, I try to understand where the other person is coming from. However, isn't that me just justifying their behavior?). I never cheated, she cheated on me. Then while we were on a 5 day break she slept with someone but a break is a break and I don't think she did anything wrong or against the rules. Doesn't exactly show she wants to be with me but for some reason she wont let me leave. 

The creeping normalcy just kinda continued. I slowly just shut down. Stopped working out and taking care of myself. I had such low level of self-worth and I was disgusted by myself for apparently being a monster. I finally decided to go to therapy. It was helping but something I learned after we had broke up is this, if your partner is not willing to work on themselves while you are working on yourself the relationship is doomed to continue its downward spiral. I told my therapist that I knew it would get better but it never did. The last day I saw her outside of a court room was when I was being hauled off to jail for interfering her in making a police report. Four days later I would have an overwhelming sense of freedom and joy when it hit me that we couldn't talk to each other according to the law. I thought it was finally over. Then the harassment began. She called all the contacts that were in my phone when cloned it and told them I am an abusive asshole, a woman beater. She would go to my classes at school and look for me while I hid in the stairwell. I was genuinely afraid of talking to her or getting back together with her. Her harassment continues to this day and there is not a damn thing I can do about it. She is trying to get me kicked out of school. She filed a complaint at my school and the worst part is that she is not even a student. So i have to go in front of a board and defend myself to graduate. 

I was fine until she started to interfere with my life again. It just didn't feel right. I feel as though she gets to go on her merry way while I sit here and blame myself for everything. Then I was signed up for a domestic violence class through the VA. I soon realized that she was an abuser as well. I remember explaining to my family that it was my fault for her cheating on me. She would just keep screaming at me that I forced her to because I didn't give her what she needed. I now know that is a great situation to have a assertive conversation about. 

 I asked my new girlfriend if it was okay with her if I could leave the house, she explained to me that it was weird that I was asking permission to leave. This leads me into the unit we are going over right now in our domestic violence class. It is called emotional abuse. I never thought twice about the shit she said to me in anger. It definitely impacted me. I had to start private therapy because I was so damned confused. She ended pressing charges for that initial fight and time was handed down to me. Everyone is in her corner and all the resources are in her corner. She contacted friends and family and tried to isolate me. She contacted job recruiters I was networking though and told them about me. She contacted my college and is trying to get me kicked out. I am going to have to pay restitution which i'm fine with as long as I actually broke it (if she includes lost wages for when she didn't feel like getting up and going to work I am going to lose it, but then again there is absolutely nothing I can do). I am going to be paying for her lawyer fees, court fees and fines. I mean the list just keeps going and she just walks away.  She lied on the stand so that finally woke me up and realized that I really don't know what she is capable of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

1. Am I victim blaming? If so how and what would you recommend to fix it and see it another way. 
2. Does it sound like I am trying to justify my actions?
3. Is this situation normal? Do relationships like these happen often?
4. I am super confused and really don't know what to believe. Its a weird feeling not being able to trust or read your own feelings. 
5. Do you think she had her part to play and was emotional abusive? (for the record she has physically hit me but even my own lawyer said that was irrelevant)
6. Does this shed light on the dynamics of the relationship and what was really going on?
7. Am I totally at fault. Am I just another perpetrator thinking he is a partial victim in all this?

aml4h7,"Feeling guilty that husband is ready for the next phase of our lives, and I'm not.","I posted this on another sub, but someone messaged me and asked that I post here. New to reddit, so I apologize if this isn't in the proper format. I'm using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

My Husband &amp; I have been together for 5 years total and will be married for 2 years in May. He can be a great guy most of the time, but before we got married our relationship was pretty rocky. I was 24 when we met and he was 26, so we were both kind of immature and fought a lot. I'm an extrovert and he is an introvert, so when we would go out with my friends he would drink a lot ""to help with his social anxiety"" and would at times become violent. I got pregnant in 2016 and terminated at 9 weeks because he became more violent. Please don't judge me for this. I already carry a lot of guilt and shame about my decision. I just didn't want to raise a child in that kind of environment. He has slammed my head against the car window, choked me, kicked me in the stomach while pregnant along with other things. 

A couple of months after I terminated my pregnancy, he proposed. Everything was great during our year long engagement. We got along really well, there was no abuse, we rarely fought and had a good time planning our wedding. After we got married, things started to fall apart again. He became obsessed with money and started controlling everything I spent. I make almost double what he makes and I'm all about having a budget, but he took it to the extreme. Every day I felt like I was walking on eggshells and felt like I had to ask him for permission if I was going to spend any money. Even if it was just $10. I was berated and screamed at just for buying him a 1-year anniversary gift. Last April he choked me again, but he hasn't laid a hand on me since. Instead he has been emotionally abusive and I feel like I'm walking on eggshells more than ever. 

We own a condo together that is paid off and we have spent the past year doing renovations which was extremely stressful. Now that all the renovations are done, my husband is ready for us to buy a house and start planning for a family. At first I was excited about the idea of getting a house. Our condo is a one bedroom/one bath, so the idea of having more space was appealing to me. Now I'm starting to have second thoughts. We live in a big city and I love the area we live in, but the houses are not affordable. Even smaller houses start out at $700,000, so my husband wants to look in the suburbs. I'm okay with this; however, the area he wants to move to I would not consider the suburbs. It's more like the country and is out in the middle of nowhere. We wouldn't have any close neighbors and that gives me anxiety, and we wouldn't be close to any friends or family. I'm also afraid that if I were to get pregnant again, that the abuse would start again. Even though he hasn't laid a hand on me in almost a year, it will always be in the back of my mind. 

I'm not sure how to get over it and fully trust him again. I'm not sure what I'm looking for by posting this. No one knows about our situation and I've never talked to anyone about any of this, so I guess I just wanted a safe place to get it out and express my concerns. I do feel like he has made a huge effort to change, but he can still be controlling. I feel guilty for not being ready to take this next step with him and I feel like I'm being too cautious because of our past.",throwaway53685368,2019-02-02 18:02:42,10,688,32.82,51.16,77.74,25.77,16.78,13.81,95.06,61.34,19.19,14.53,8.28,3.05,0,3.2,0,4.65,6.1,13.81,11.19,6.83,7.41,2.47,19.91,3.78,2.47,0.87,2.33,2.91,4.94,2.47,2.47,1.31,1.02,0,12.21,2.03,0.58,0,3.92,14.39,2.47,1.74,2.18,3.2,2.03,4.22,1.74,0.29,0.15,1.31,2.62,0.58,1.31,0.58,0.58,10.76,6.1,0.58,1.74,2.03,0.44,7.12,10.76,1.16,15.99,1.45,7.12,7.41,0.15,0.87,2.03,1.6,0,0,0.44,0,0.15,0.15,0.15,0,13.95,5.96,3.63,0,0.29,0,0,0.15,0.29,3.05,0,0.58

amo745,I can't get him out of my head!,"Hello everyone. 

I've never posted here before, and to be honest I've not spoken to anyone about this, but I need to get it off my chest and see if anyone has experienced anything similar or might be able to help me.

In November 2017 I left my physically and emotionally abusive partner. We were on and off until July where I managed to walk away completely. We cut each other off and neither of us opened the lines of communication again, which suited me fine and I was able to start healing. Everything was going well until I started dating again. 

In September I met the most amazing man. He's so incredibly good to me, loves my daughter, unlike my ex, and has become the safe place I never thought I would have. I am so happy with him and can see myself with him forever, but I cannot get my ex out of my head. Not because I miss him, not for a second, but more because I am SO ANGRY with how much abuse he got away with and how much he has changed me as a person. I am constantly worrying whether or not I'm good enough for my partner (thankfully he knows everything about what happened with my ex and is nothing but supportive and keeps reminding me ""I'm not him"" but I don't want to be this person.

I want him to know how wrong he was that no one would ever love my daughter like his own, I want him to realise how good I was to him and how much I contributed despite the complaints that I didn't. I want to set the record straight and kick up a fuss and scream at him, tell him how actually, I don't forgive you for all the times you hit me, and it took me longer to get over each occurrence despite you expecting me to get over it every time you apologised.

I want to tell him how much I despise him and how vile a person he is but I want him to know how much pity i have for him. I saw you hanging on a girl when I was out with my partner a few weeks ago and how ashamed I felt on your behalf because you looked desperate and insecure. And how my partner had to hold my face in his hands and tell me over and over again that I'm safe, and that you can't do anything to me.

I need him out of my head. Every name he called me, every judgement he passed, every manipulation and every raised hand, I want them out. It's like a headache that won't go away. I want my old self back not the dirtied part of me that he's created. I don't want to be angry at the injustice anymore.

How do I heal?",DandyLion89,2019-02-03 01:39:31,1,492,10.36,29.15,70.25,32.76,21.39,12.8,96.14,65.65,26.02,21.34,13.62,0.61,1.63,5.28,0.2,4.67,3.05,14.23,8.54,6.3,11.18,3.86,18.9,3.86,1.83,3.46,0.61,3.46,6.91,3.66,3.25,0.81,1.22,0.41,15.04,0.41,0.81,0.61,5.49,17.48,1.42,3.66,3.05,1.83,3.05,5.28,2.03,0.81,0.41,0.61,2.64,1.42,0.81,0,0,8.54,2.85,0.61,2.64,2.03,0.61,5.08,13.01,0.81,12.2,1.02,6.3,5.08,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,0.81,0,0,0,0.2,0,11.79,4.27,3.46,0,0,0.2,0.2,0,0.41,3.05,0.2,0
amodo6,I'm scared of my S/O,"Me(24) with S/O(27), 3+ years and living together. TL;DR I'm scared for my safety

I wrote my S/O a letter telling him about my feelings and frustrations with our lack of communication and relationship issues, because I have a hard time expressing myself clearly and calmly with speech. He rolled his eyes and told me he hates letters and he's not going to read it.

I left it for him to read, hoping he would read it when he calmed down.

He burned it.

He burned it and told me, ""This is what I think of your letter.""

I have no where to go. No friends to stay with, no money for a hotel, no churches, I could check myself into a mental hospital but that would be worst case. What can I do if he's still mad at me in the morning? He hasn't ever hit me or anyone, so Im not scared physically. But he is scaring me, and he's never been like this before. I have his mom to talk to on the phone, and people on reddit. But no place to go to until the morning. He's let me be in the bedroom so far. I'm afraid to be alone with him. He hasn't hurt me so I can't call the cops, and bringing them in would only make it worse. I have to live with him for at least a few weeks until he heads off to stay with his parents in another state for a while.

amxput,Slapped by my wife today,"Reposting it here due to mod's recommendations.

Some background info: I have been with my wife together for 5 years , married for the past 9 months.

Throughout the relationship she always had an anger management issue and would raise her voice, throw a tantrum when things didn't go her way or when we had a difference in opinion. That being said she also has her 'normal' side and other traits like faithful, a responsible adult and such. Hey, nobody's perfect right? You just gotta deal with what life gives you.


Also, whenever we have a difference in opinion or have a different recollection of events, she has the tendency to dismiss my arguments / points as invalid due to me having a 'bad memory' and being 'forgetful'. Whenever she does that I just give up the argument because it would always be her word against mine and there simply makes no point to keep refuting her claims to no end.



I think I am an extremely tolerant guy and have been accommodating her during the course of relationship. During an argument I would make it a point to keep myself in check , argue based on logic and not raise my voice cause you know 2 people hollering at each other doesn't really help the situation. When sharing my frustrations with my friends about this they would always pat me on the back and told me that if it was them they would have ended the relationship long ago. Anyway, I digress.



So like all couples we had an argument again today over something REALLY trival. 



I must make it clear that the following happened a few days or even last week and yes we were arguing oversomething that had already happened. We were arguing about something else and she digged this topic up again to make her point cause well ya know - some people just like harping on the past.



So, she had left something lying in the kitchen (it was her stuff btw, just some lame paper bags) and was mad that I didn't take the initiative to clean up after her. In my defense, said item was out of my sight (on another table) and naturally I did not see it hence I did not keep it for her. 



But hell no, according to her she was insisting that the paper bags (lame, I know) were right in my face and I chose to ignore them and not keep it.  However, I remember clear as crystal that this was not the case and she was trying to twist facts to suit her argument.  Now we had a case of her word against mine and as mentioned above I would usually give up arguing but not today as I remembered clear as sky that those lame paper bags were really not in my sight. 



Not proud of it ,I was mad as well, lost my cool and called her out on it , shouted and called her a lying bitch. I must also make it clear that sometimes when we get too carried away we both use expletives on each other. Not healthy for a relationship, but that happens for us.



However, what happened next I believe, was totally unacceptable. She slapped me twice in my face. While driving. 



I dropped her off at her work place and stormed off. She seems to be realizing the magnitude of her actions and have been apologizing and stuff but I have been ignoring her since I don't there is any justification for getting physical with your partner.



Sorry for long post and if this constitutes as a borderline rant post. This just happened this morning and I needed  a place to vent as well as ask as I don't know what to do and probably get some advice that I wouldn't have heard of.

Though she has not battered me till the extent I need to go to the hospital, hitting your partner in a relationship is a whole new level. I'm sure some of you here has been on the receiving end before - is it ever possible to recover emotionally and the broken trust from getting hit by your partner?

an16er,My friend is in a da situation,Hi I'm worried about my friend. We've been friends since school and she has recently moved near me with her newish boyfriend. As far as I can tell from the outside looming in and what she has told me he is a manipulative piece of shit that has put his hands on her. She there him out of the house this weekend and he had to be moved on by police twice and was eventually arrested for kicking her door in. He has since self harmed and has now been sectioned. She now has his family who live nowhere bear her threatening to kill her. She is trying to make the break from him but I am concerned that once he is released from being sectioned he will try to get back in her house. I am trying to support her as much as possible but is there any advice anyone cam give that might help me help her.

an1z3y,I need some help coming to terms...,"Hi all,
Well. I didn’t think I’d ever be here, but I guess none of us did. I recently got out of a relationship, we were together for a little over a year. He’s an alcoholic. It mostly was just him getting drunk and yelling at me and then the last straw was when he threw things at me after a night out. One time he yelled at me so bad the neighbors had to come over. He frequently called me a spoiled bitch when he was sober and there was a lot of gaslighting that went on as well. So since our break up, which was about 6 weeks ago, I have been struggling a lot. I will frequently randomly cry. I have anxiety attacks. I’m trying really hard not to dismiss my own feelings by saying “well it could’ve been worse” but I can’t stop doing that. I went out with a new guy this week and he’s very nice (please spare me the “it’s too early to be dating again” speeches. That’s not why I’m here), but I started to have a lot of anxiety worrying about what would happen if we ran into him. It makes me so nervous to the point where I don’t even want to go places because I’m so nervous about running into him. I just don’t know how to deal with all of these emotions. I go to therapy, but feel like I need more help. If anyone has some insight it would be very appreciated.",pestiter,2019-02-04 06:06:54,3,262,16.24,27.08,89.8,2.39,14.56,11.45,96.56,65.27,19.85,14.5,9.54,1.53,0,3.44,0,5.34,5.34,14.12,12.6,11.45,7.63,2.67,23.28,4.58,2.29,2.67,0.76,3.44,7.63,2.29,4.96,2.29,1.53,0.38,9.16,0,0.76,0,3.82,15.65,2.29,1.91,3.05,4.58,1.15,4.2,2.67,0,1.53,1.15,1.15,0,0.76,0,0.76,8.4,4.2,0.38,2.67,0.76,1.15,8.02,11.45,1.15,19.08,3.44,6.87,8.4,0,1.15,0.38,0,0,0,1.53,0.38,0,0,1.15,0,17.56,7.63,2.67,0,0,0,0,0,1.53,4.96,0.76,0
an5iei,You're not dead.,"I'm sorry I'm just desperate and at my wits end.

My whole time growing up I was told i was worthless. My parents didn't want me. My ex was terrible to me. I have no friends or anything to talk to. So basically, no one cared about me at all, except for me.

Then I met my boyfriend I'm with now. He was really nice. He was really controlling from the beginning and I just thought that meant he cares. So over time, like we've been together for 11 years, I have just felt like he is the only person who ever has or will care for me.

He has been pretty physically and verbally abusive. He has hit me a lot. I have bruises on my face right now from the other day. He screams at me for hours. I just have to tiptoe and not say what I really think and he doesn't get mad. 

I am used to it but it's really frustrating sometimes when I want to say something but I can't because I know he'll start yelling at me or backhand me or tell me to shut up.

Well the other day he said some stuff that just made me think ""I just don't know who you are.""

I was crying Because he had just jumped on top of me while he was yelling at me about saying that he's abusive. That's when he was hitting me in the head why I have these bruises. So I was crying when he got done and he said ""shut up, I didn't kill you. You're not dead, it's not that bad."" 

He also said he just slaps me around sometimes. But oh my god. He has done so much more like I have felt like I was going to die. He gets so mad he said he blacks out and doesn't know what he's doing, which I believe just based on some of the things he has done. and whenever I break down he acts like he understands that he is abusive but then when he is mad it's back to him saying he doesn't do anything wrong.

I have told him before that I feel like I can't handle any more physical abuse. I have panic attacks sometimes while he's yelling at me and it usually just makes him yell at me more. 

I called the domestic violence hotline and she just told me I need to stop being a victim and leave, but that's easier said than done at this point and if I leave I know I am so messed up mentally that I will be alone for the rest of my life.

He keeps pressuring me to have kids and I don't want to because he's so abusive. But he says that it will help him not be like that if we had a kid. He would never do that to his kid. And he also said that if he was still abusive to me he would just not be with me and still have visitation if we had a kid.

I really like how he wants me to pump out his kid, then once my life is ruined by that and he's still hitting me and I leave I know his family has enough money and connections in town I would never see my child again. So I don't want to get pregnant but he keeps screaming about it. 

Sorry I know this was totally incomprehensible. English is not my language. Thanks for listening. Just had to get it off my chest.",Throwawayu6716543,2019-02-04 11:52:16,3,603,1.86,28.64,66.46,1,15.07,9.62,96.52,69.15,27.86,21.72,12.77,0.5,0.66,7.79,0,6.14,1.99,11.28,13.76,8.96,9.45,3.48,25.87,2.82,2.49,1.99,0.5,1.66,6.8,1.33,5.47,0.5,2.65,1.16,15.26,0.5,0.33,0.17,7.96,14.26,2.49,1.66,2.16,3.32,0.83,5.8,3.65,0.17,2.99,0.5,1.33,0.5,0.83,0.17,0,5.8,1.66,0.17,2.99,0.83,0.5,7.3,15.42,1.49,12.44,1.16,5.31,5.97,0,0.17,0.33,0.17,0.17,0.66,0.5,0,0,0,0.33,0,13.27,6.63,1.49,0,0,0,0,0,0.66,4.48,0,0

an7183,How do I get out? How do I convince people he is not what he appears?,"I posted this on /relationships but they took it down and directed me here. 

I'm very introverted and shy. I've been in the same job since graduating uni. Bookkeeping, low human interaction. A couple of people who I'd call friends left over from uni, but I see a few times a year. I have separated parents who have busy lives and a sister who just married and lives across the country. 

I'm slim, fit and pretty, just terminally shy and socially awkward. I don't have a very good self image and I am in therapy for that. I dated a bit in uni, but nothing serious, and by the time I was 30, I felt it was now or never and I really put myself out there with Internet dating, because I really wanted a family and felt that time was running out.

I actually had two relationships of a couple of months before I met my current SO. The first date was amazing. We spent 6 hours talking and just really jumped into it. We shared the hobby of marathon running and were a good match as running partners and just had a great time. A year after meeting we moved in together. I asked for it and he was on board.

In hindsight, I've done most of the pushing forward in this relationship, but he's always said yes. We've been together four years now, lived together for three. 

Two years ago I said I wanted a baby and he said yes. Like with everything. Well, I got pregnant and the pregnancy turned out to be high risk. I had to stop running. And that turned out to be the main thing we had in common and did together. 

He started spending lots of time with his friends. He has A LOT of friends. Very extraverted, life of any event, the complete opposite of me. With him, around him, I'd gotten more social as well, but during my pregnancy I got really isolated except for a couple of his female friends who also had kids who became my support system. 

After the baby was born he grew even more distant. He started spending 3 day weekends away. Working very late. I was essentially a single mum. Overtired, exhausted. Often went weeks without adult interaction. 

It's been so important to me to maintain the image of a good relationship, I didn't ask for help from anyone because all assumed of course my SO was helping. He never was. 

Over time, resentment built and by the time baby was half a year old I started confronting him about his lack of support. 

That's when he started calling me a bitch. Do things like when I asked him to put away his dirty dishes after himself, he would go and wash his cup, then fill it with water, walk up to me and pour it down my head. There's countless examples of stuff like this. I asked him to take out the trash while I was taking care of baby's bath and he said I should have done it myself being at home all day with the baby, and so to teach me a lesson he emptied the trash bag on baby's bed so I'd have to deal with the trash myself before getting to put baby to sleep. He loves ""teaching"" me as he calls it. 

He's hit me a few times. He calls me horrible names regularly. 

But he is so charming with his friends and my family. It's Jekyll and Hyde how he treats me in public and in private. 

I've threatened to leave him now twice to make him see some sense, but he laughs in my face and says I'll never make it financially. And that he will 100 percent get out of paying child support. 

The second time he said that if I leave, he will sue for solo custody. Even though I'm certain he doesn't want the baby. But he'd do it to teach me a lesson. 

I should still leave, right? 

Around the time I first mentioned leaving he's started a really aggressive social media campaign about being world's best dad. He hasn't changed a diaper in months, has never spent more than 10 minutes (for my shower) taking care of the baby on his own. I do all wakeups, feedings, diaper changes, doctor's appointments. I cook, clean the house, etc. 

But his social media is full of cute daddy baby photos. His friends eat it up. My parents worship the ground he walks on because thanks to him their spinster daughter gave them a grandshild. I mean both my mom and dad have said it to my face that I have to do ""everything possible"" to keep him. 

I know I have to leave. Our baby is turning one year old and will soon start understanding how he treats me. But I've never broken up with anyone. I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to deal with my parents who will blame me, I don't know how to deal with the social isolation, the financial stress I'll be put into. I don't even know if anyone would believe me if I explained how he acts behind closed doors. Why should they? He's the definition of charm and to his friends he's the friend to call at 2am when there's trouble. I've asked him about it, and since he's completely candid with me, he has explained his theories about ""social capital"" and how he collects ""useful"" people and he'll bend backward for these useful people. 

It's just. How do I get out of this? How do I get my baby away from this?

Called the cops after a pretty nasty fight and he was immediately arrested and spent the night in jail on battery, false imprisonment and disorderly conduct charges. He got released on bond and flew back to his home state to stay with his family, but still has to show up here for his court date. 

I have so many photos of the physical abuse and screenshots of him admitting that he physically abused me. 

The deputies handling the case want me to send them all the pictures and screenshots as evidence and testify. One deputy is trying to make the false imprisonment stick because it's a felony.

I am feeling guilty because I don't necessarily want him to go to prison or to ruin his life with this permanently on his record, I just want him out of my life. 

He's a typical narcissist and even though I have a restraining order against him and have blocked him on social media, he finds ways to contact me and to tell me that he still loves me and wants to make it work, and that he's sorry and that he'll change and that it won't happen again.  Even after all this, he is still asking if we can be together again and if he can stay with me when he flies back in for his court date.

anf0r2,Abusive Father,"So throughout my life I have witnessed my father be abusive to my mum twice. Once was when I was in year 8 and the second time was about two years ago. My dad has serious anger issues and he uses this to his advantage to terrify me and my brother and my mum however my mum also uses this to her advantage sometimes to scare me and my brother who has recently moved out. 

My father has been extremely abusive to my mum before I was born, because she has told me this. And on several occasions the police have been called. ( I had to call them once)
I am 21 now and for 21 years I have been afraid of his temper and have tried to be a person who he wants me to be but as of recently I have come to my senses and realised that I need to stop making my parents happy and start making myself happy. For the past year I have had this feeling inside me that me and my dad are going to soon have a massive argument which will most likely lead him to abusing me in a very fierce way however I am trying my best to not be afraid of him anymore because I have lost respect for him as my dad and as a person. I know that the end result of this could lead to two outcomes, my dad being arrested for almost killing me or I escaping and moving away somewhere. And I don’t know if I’m ready for this inevitable future. I am writing this today because it was today when I truly felt this confrontation was going to happen yet I am in my bed peacefully typing this. 
I don’t know whether to be happy or upset that I am not alone in this and this fear threatens more people than I expected.

anlswf,Mother's boyfriend is beating her [California],"I've heard from people for a couple years that my mother's boyfriend is abusive but I didn't know the extent of it until Thanksgiving. My family got to her house and they were both drunk. She told us that that morning he had thrown her on the ground and kicked the literal shit out of her. She also told us she thought her arm and ribs were broken from a prior incident. My family confronted him and he admitted what he had done. She begged and pleaded that we not get the authorities involved and that everything is fine if they're not drinking. We told him that if we heard anything else we would be calling the authorities. A mistake in hindsight.

On Sunday I drove to her house and she had a large gash and contusion on her forehead. She told me they got in a drunken argument and threw his phone at his face. He slammed her forehead on the ground and kicked her. He dragged her by the hair and made her shower and clean the blood up. He was still there 

I talked to her and she said she would consider filling a report once he leaves for work for the week. I'm worried she won't follow through. I'm extremely worried about her physical and mental condition. I cannot let this continue. She doesn't want to lose him and is protecting him. She's worried about his half of the finances.

I have a lot of questions. Can I file the battery report without her? Should I file the report against her wishes? 

Is she also going to be charged for throwing the phone? He's got a small bruise on his cheek. 

What evidence should I bring if I do file a report? I have photographic evidence of her injuries and my second hand account. I have family and friends that are willing to write statements about  what they've heard. Is this enough for charges to stick if she refuses to testify?

What should I do next and what's the best way to do it?

anoa31,How to handle my sister's abusive relationship with her boyfriend,"My sister (mid-20s) is a recovering heroine addict with OCD, anorexia, and borderline personality disorder. She also lives with her boyfriend (mid-30s), who is also a recovering addict with anger management issues. Several of her friends have secretly contacted me or various members of my family on Facebook to tell us that she has been abused by him. We don't really know the details -- extent, frequency, etc. My mom found out in early December and immediately called him out. My sister cares so much about him being accepted by my family that she initially vehemently denied the claims, but eventually hinted that they were a one-time thing that happened in the past. She has gone on a crusade against my mom for spreading this information to other family members. 

Despite denying the claims, she has still repeatedly told us in the past that he's very jealous, controlling, and angry. She has been forced several times to block all of her male facebook friends, and she often can't leave the house without his permission.

My family and I don't know how to proceed. On one hand, the above details paint a grim portrait of what's happening inside their home; on the other, the seriousness has been downplayed by a couple things.

1. My family lives near her and sees her almost every week, and they've never noticed any obvious signs of abuse.
2. When confronted about this behavior, he texted them about how much he loves her, how he's working on his anger management issues, and indirectly admitting that he abused her in the past.
3. She still cares deeply about him and talks him up all the time

I personally don't believe these reasons mitigate the seriousness of the situation, but I'm not sure how to proceed. I don't think she can be convinced to leave him. Even if she did, it would probably need to be coordinated with authorities or something so that she could leave him without physical repercussions.

Do you folks have any ideas either how to convince her or intervene? Here are the courses of action I'm considering

1. Call the cops or a domestic abuse hotline, although she would probably deny it to them.
2. My dad currently pays for her rent because she can't afford it on her own. I've tried to convince him to pull the plug on her unless she separates him (along with a bunch of other stipulations for bettering her life). He can't stomach the idea of her getting evicted from her apartment though.",anonymoutis,2019-02-05 23:15:43,2,437,36.91,82.6,9.9,7.35,16.19,20.82,90.85,57.89,21.28,16.48,3.89,0.69,0.23,10.53,1.14,4.81,5.72,13.96,7.78,6.64,7.09,2.52,15.33,1.37,0.46,2.06,1.6,2.97,4.35,1.37,2.97,0,2.29,0.23,20.37,2.75,0.92,8.01,4.81,15.56,3.66,2.29,1.14,3.2,1.37,5.49,0.46,0.23,0,0.23,2.52,0.46,1.83,0,0.23,8.92,5.03,1.14,2.75,0.23,0,4.58,10.3,0.23,11.9,1.6,5.26,5.03,1.14,1.6,2.29,0.46,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.48,5.72,4.35,0,0.23,0.23,0,1.14,0,3.43,1.37,0

anouyb,"I believe I am being poisoned, followed, and blackmailed by my ex.","I know it sounds crazy, and it’s taken over 2 years for me to accept and come to the conclusion that this isn’t in my head. But over the past 4 years or so that I have known him, I have grown rapidly sicker. When I was healthy before. It started as continuously getting strange skin problems, first very dry and it would crack and break and digestion problems. It moved to having these pus filled boils that would appear under my arms, near my groin, I couldn’t eat without having stomach problems, kidney infections, low white blood cell count. Then I began having cellulitis, starting on the inside on my knee cap and then my left eye. I’ve gotten it in my nose, and on my cheeks, been diagnosed with staph consistently since then. To me it sounds like something inner. Not to mention joint pain, swelling, numbness, chest pain, inflammation, dehydration. 
 I met him through work as a dancer at a club I worked at, he seemed very overly infatuated but I was young at thought that finally someone was treating me the way I’d always wanted. We ended up moving in together and soon a lot of secrets started pouring out. He told me he had a sex addiction, was cheating on me with multiple men, was going behind my back and spreading rumors to my friends and family and even people at the stores I shopped at. He would hack all my devices and log onto all my account, watch my bank activity. When we finally broke up he even stole my cell phone at the time (I believe to have my information and pictures and everything.) 
 Another weird thing is that I got a cat that we rescued shortly after me moving in with him. The cat cane with complete shots and was healthy. The place we got him from does full medical before any adopting. After only a few months the cat got very sick, we got him in February and by May he was to the point that he was dying from feline leukemia. At around mid June I left to visit my mom and my siblings in another state, the day I leave and get to the hotel he face times me and says when he got home from dropping me off at the airport my cat Sammy was worse than he had ever been. (We had gotten him medicine and done everything the vets suggested we do for him) he said for me to say goodbye and that he had called the vet and they said they would need to put him down. I just think the timing was so off. The cat was not any different when we left for the airport. And my ex was who fed him each morning before work. 
 I have looked up the signs and symptoms for leukemia in humans, and it sounds eerily similar. My doctors are already wondering if I could have lupus or another autoimmune disorder. But I was very healthy, energetic, before all of this. It’s accumulatively gotten worse and I just have this weird feeling that something else is going on. 
 After we broke up I was watching tv one night in bed and saw a man peering in my sliding glass door. I immediately got up and the guy just slowly walked away. I’ve had my accounts logged in from other devices, I feel like I’m being followed even though I’ve moved apartments. And I feel at danger when I go to work. Certain customers seem like they know me already, will say things that seem out of place. 
 I’m waiting for blood work back, I went to the doctor last week and she seemed very scared for me. She gave me referral to rheumatology, a full blood panel, and said I may have to see an infectious disease specialist.
 I feel that even though I have moved he has found access to me once again, may be monitoring me somehow electronically (he is a software developer and familiar with tech things) and now that I have my own cats just today had to take one of them in and now he is also having bowel problems. A blockage which can lead to toxic shock in his blood. I take very good care of my cats, I love them more than anything. I’ve had insomnia all my life and idk if it’s because of feeling sick or something else, but now I can be so tired suddenly that I sleep for over 12 hours. I have really crazy dreams and even sometimes think I hear people at the door. 
 I know this all sounds insane but I’m scared! I don’t know what is really being done to me and what is just me being freaked out. I feel like nobody believes me, it’s so isolating and i just need to get it out.",Ashura777,2019-02-06 00:51:16,5,836,28.39,32.05,92.27,3.73,19.44,14.59,92.34,59.93,21.77,15.91,11,1.08,0,3.23,0.6,5.86,3.95,13.52,9.81,5.86,8.01,0.96,20.57,4.55,2.51,1.08,0.84,1.79,4.43,1.08,3.35,0.24,0.24,0.48,9.21,0.36,0.24,0.36,3.35,11.24,3.47,0.36,1.79,2.87,1.32,2.87,3.83,1.08,1.44,1.2,5.74,2.03,3.11,0.12,0.36,7.54,1.91,0.96,1.67,2.27,0.84,8.61,9.69,1.2,17.22,2.39,8.13,6.94,1.32,0.84,0.72,0.72,0,0.12,0.48,0.12,0.12,0,0,0.12,11.84,5.02,4.19,0,0,0,0.12,0,0,1.79,0.72,0
anpz4f,I tried to leave and chickened out at the last minute. Everyone is so upset with me. (Possible TW),"We have a place that runs a safe house (I don’t know if that’s the right term). Anyway, it’s a 5 bedroom house in a confidential location. 2 women share a bedroom each. 

I had an appointment today to get a bed there. My best friend helped me get all of my shit, let me spend the night at her house, and was going to use her lunch break to take me. At the last minute, quite literally, I called a cab and threw all of my shit in the back of his car and came home. I didn’t tell her as I knew she’d be pissed. 

I don’t know why I did that. It’s so confusing. I’ve tried leaving 3 times and I can’t do it. I can’t understand myself. Everyone is so mad at me because I didn’t follow through. I am afraid of taking the leap. I don’t think a lot of people understand how hard it is to leave the person you love. 

Some background - I am 40F. We have been together for just over 2 years. Not long I know. The abuse is all physical. And it’s scary. He’s choked me, sat on my chest and punched me until my nose bled, smearing it all over my face. I know the statistics on strangulation so I am always on edge. This happens when he drinks. We both have drinking problems btw. 

I know it’s the same old story. When we don’t drink we get along like the best of best friends. Shit even when we do drink, we have such a good time together. 

A year ago he was arrested for beating the shit out of me. I had a TPO against him and everything. After only a week I let him come home because rent was due. And I missed him. I even sat next to him in court. He got off easy considering how bad he’d beaten me. Just classes every week and like a 500 dollar fine. His bail prior to that was 5000 in cash all up front. That was a pretty high amount. 

Uh... where am I going with this? Ok so well obviously the violence has been happening more often. 3 times this past week in fact. I have scrapes on my arms. Huge purple bruises on my arms and legs. Bruises on my chest. Hips. He is smaller than me but really fast. Like lightning fast. He pulled me to the ground recently in our parking lot and I had to scream rape, fire, someone help me. That made him run off into the apt and I went to a friends around the corner. I keep all of my medications in my purse and he was trying to take it from me. He’s actually pissed in my purse (the most expensive thing I own). He’s broken 3 of my phones in the past year as well. 

I keep my keys, money, phone and a little baggy of my meds in my bra pretty much all the time. I’ve slept with my shoes on just in case I need to run. 

I hope this is still being read. I know it’s long. So I can see his eyes change when he’s about to get crazy. He goes vacant. And nothing hurts him. I have squeezed the ever living shit out of his balls to get him off me and he doesn’t relent. My mother pepper sprayed the fuck out of his eyes from 5 inches and he continued to beat up my 250 lb stepdad. And was winning. This man is 5’10 and like 145 lbs. 

I live in constant fear. Especially when he brings home a bottle. There’s no other abuse... I can talk to whoever. I can go out all night with the girls and he doesn’t bother me at all. He doesn’t control me like that. I’m just straight up getting beaten. 

One more thing, I believe he is gay and angry about it. I know he is bi. But I think he’s angry about being gay. I just have that feeling. And I talked to his ex today and she said the same thing. He was never physically violent with her. It was the first time I’d talked to her. But anyway. 

Why did I come back?? Why is it so hard? I know he can kill me. I think he will end up killing me. And I just needed to get that off my chest.

anynmr,what can I do,"I (53/m) don't know how to handle the behaviour of my partner (36/f) of 6 years.  I feel constantly tormented by things she says to me, sometimes really cruel things.  As just one example this week she came to me to say how a friend of hers had posted a message on social media implying that I had been sleeping with my partner's sister.  At first I dismissed it but very quickly she began to threaten me about what would happen if this rumour turned out true.  The more I denied it the more she insisted that my denial meant it must be true.  Of course it is not true.  I have next to no contact with this sister (nor any other woman) and certainly never even thought of doing such a thing.  But these accusations and threats are quite frequent.  I have tried everything to prove I am a good and honest man but this keeps reoccurring and it breaks me down.  Just when I start to feel comfortable in our relationship it happens again.  She has in the past been violent to me during these episodes.  It's been many months since she gave me any bruises but my fear of her doing it again never leaves me.

ao0zua,My abuser commited suicide. I'm so relieved I feel guilty.,"I found out today that my abuser took his own life this week. It's been a long time and finding this out stirred up a lot of confusing feelings, but the biggest one is just overwhelming relief... which has me feeling very conflicted. I've lost several people close to me to suicide, and I know how hard it is to cope with when you loose someone that way and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

BUT.

i firmly believe that he eventually would have killed someone, if he hasn't already done so and gotten away with it. I vividly remember being curled up in a tiny ball on a bathroom crying while he held a gun to my head, telling me he would hide my body so well no one would ever find me. I did and still do believe he could have.

aocfp2,What do I do?!?,"So my best friend of over 20 years is in a toxic abusive situation.  She is held hostage by surveillance a system, dependent because he has all the money, vulnerable because she’s lost all other relationships due to lack of engagement as she’s not allowed to engage.  She’s also in his hometown far away from her family.  She laughs it off and self medicates. She goes silent for days after major incidents between them. She makes sarcastic comments joking around but I hear her fear.  I’ve witnessed the abuse first hand to the point I was so uncomfortable I had to return home early while on holiday. I’m over 1000 miles away so I can’t physically be there for her if needed. What do I do? I’ve shared my thoughts and feelings with her and him. She is not allowed to speak to me on the phone anymore so we talk when she’s at work.  I’m terrified for her but also angry! I want her to wake up and get the hell out, she was 100% self sufficient prior to him. She’s lonely and afraid of being alone and she’s settling. What do I do?

aoj5m6,24 year old desperate for hope,"Hi,

I’m finally posting on reddit after tons of deleted drafts.
My mother, brother and I have been abused for decades by a horrible person I have to refer to as my father. My brother recently moved out, but I’m still here. 
I recently took a break from work to clear my head and move in a better direction. It’s arguably the worst decision I’ve ever made. It’s not like I made much money, but without it - I’m even worse off. 
The abuse is becoming worse day by day. It is emotional at this moment, but has been physical in the past. He is showing signs of great resentment towards me and I am almost certain he will try to attack me soon.
I want to get my mom and myself out of this situation. We have no money and I’m feeling so helpless. Recently, a relative died and I was supposed to receive a part of the inheritance, but I got cheated out it. 
Please help me. Advice, or any stories of success will give me some hope.

aoj7u5,Need help.,"So for a while now my sister (14) has been living in absolute fear of our dad. 

Whenever he’s slightly annoyed by something his immediate response is to hit it.

As I’m sure you can imagine he hits her quite a lot and she’s finally told me and my mum about it.

Whenever I’ve confronted him about it he just tells me to “fuck off”.

What’s upsetting about the whole thing is that he’s genuinely nice and quite generous in terms of helping with my car insurance, phone bill and other subscriptions. 

He’s a good person but when his temper grips hold of him he changes into a nasty person.

Surely a few nice things don’t permit him to behave like this? He’s a  48 year old man hitting his own 14 year old daughter.

He used to hit me quite a lot too. I remember one night, I’d broken a bone in my ankle and couldn’t walk at a friend’s party.

When I went downstairs to make a drink (I crawled) he insisted it was fine and that he’d make one for me since I couldn’t walk. I then said “Oh thank you.” And for some reason that made him snap and he eventually started beating me as I curled up in a ball in the corner of my room.

aojrpp,Don't Tell Me: An open letter to the mutual friends &amp; family who will not see this.,"I left an increasingly abusive &amp; violent relationship of well over a decade some months ago, and still have a large number of mutual friends/family who don't really know why or what happened. I can't actually talk to them about it, but I'm increasingly bothered by some of their responses so I made an account to post some thoughts somewhere. It's silly but I just need this to exist in the world somewhere, rather than entirely in my head.

Feel free to pass right on by this; mild trigger warning if you don't. 



It wasn't once. It wasn't sudden. And I'm not mistaken.

It was pervasive, and subtle, and obvious, and horrible, and specifically designed to keep things exactly as they were. Some have it worse, some not so much, but none deserved it. There is nothing a person can do to warrant this perversion in disguise. I did try to do something about it, and eventually I succeeded - though I cringe to so much as call it that. Trust me, I've been paying dearly for this ""success"" ever since.

If you didn't know, don't feel guilty - nobody truly did. And it's ok if you still don't get it. There's 13 years to unravel, two lifetimes to understand, and many decades of psychological research to comprehend.

But please don't tell me ""I wasn't there; I don't know what happened"". Because I know you weren't there. I am the only one who was there for every fucking eternal second. Not even he can say that. And I know you don't know what happened. Because even if you were told, there is still a micro-universe of related minutia and life-changing events that you wouldn't know. And although I'm sure you can sympathize, without subjecting yourself to the same, I don't think you will ever truly know regardless.

It's ok to not know what to say. It's ok to feel uncomfortable. It's even ok to want to stay ""neutral"". In fact I encourage you to not jump to conclusions.

But when you tell me you don't know, you weren't there, you are telling me that you don't fully trust me. You are, probably without meaning to, telling me that without seeing his hands around my neck for yourself, that without hearing every hateful word with your own ears, that without fighting through the fog of carefully cultivated self-doubt and uncertainty to uncover each long-term manipulation and short-term gaslight through your own powers of reasoning, you are not willing to fully accept that what I said really did happen. That you dare not tell me I'm wrong or I'm lying, but you can't quite commit to actually believing me either. You'll just be in the corner, having your cake and eating it too.

And that's bullshit.

I finally realized that this isn't the same as some celebrity rumor mill, because you know me. And based on what should probably not have been a shocking amount of feedback I've gotten after openly disclosing, you know more than the ""me"". Some of you weren't even surprised, or could easily see how things jumped from what you observed to what you didn't. Hey, if I had seen what you saw sooner, I might have saved myself some of the deepest scars I own.

But for the rest of you, I have evidence. I don't need your affirmation to tell me what's real or what I experienced. That voice, the one who called forth an echo in my own skull telling me I'm wrong and it's my fault and if I would just listen it wouldn't have happened and I wouldn't get called a stupid cunt if I wasn't being a stupid cunt and our only problems are my problems and I must be making things up because the hands that were laid on me couldn't possibly be his - that voice doesn't control me anymore. I'd be lying if I said the echo was completely gone, but its life force has been excised and the bleating repetition will eventually weaken and die out, as pathetic and disgraceful as its origins. But no matter how it's painted under oath, the videos, the texts, the emails, the memories - those do not lie to me. The same cannot be said for him.

After confiding bits and pieces to a former mutual friend, months post-escape, I expressed my desire to not color any relationship that doesn't directly involve me. Placing others' value above my own, as I had been so carefully trained to do, I tried to make it clear that I wasn't running around having this conversation with just anyone because despite everything I went through and was still ahead, it was more important to me that I not fuck up the dynamics between friends than allow myself to reconnect with those same people and be unafraid in the truth.

This confidante paused and told me ""Ok, but if one of our friends did this to somebody - and I believe they did - don't you think all of us should know?"" 

I had been so worried about walking on eggshells that it never occurred to me that people *should* know, because one of our own had done something horrible and although it is possible to support a person without endorsing their actions, that behavior should not be tolerated, even by close friends. Some days I'm still not entirely sure where I stand on that, but I am sure that it's no longer on shards of shells. I finally figured out that I need to care more about myself than a bunch of metaphorical calcium carbonate.


So if you choose to abstain, that's your business. This isn't a war, there are no sides, and I've been through enough hell to want no more of it spread here on earth. The point is to move forward, not focus on the past. But the past does still exist, and I have to deal with those ripples literally for the rest of my life. So you don't need to be my #1 supporter, a nationally-ranked SJW, nor a champion of causes to address this with me. You can just be yourself, which hopefully still includes being my friend.


But don't tell me you don't know, because with those three words, you are also telling me that I don't... which is exactly what he did.",beareola,2019-02-08 10:57:34,4,1083,8.61,23.85,72.87,21.51,19.34,16.99,93.07,63.43,22.16,13.2,8.13,0.37,3.79,0.46,0.46,8.77,3.88,12.19,12.83,6.74,8.13,6.28,20.96,4.25,2.4,2.12,0.92,2.68,6.28,2.95,3.23,0.65,1.39,0.09,10.99,0.18,0.83,0,0.46,19.58,3.32,2.31,3.14,3.69,2.4,7.29,2.22,0.74,0.92,0.46,1.57,0.55,0.37,0.28,0.37,6,1.94,0.65,1.66,0.74,1.29,5.72,13.39,0.92,9.51,1.48,4.52,3.6,0.74,0.55,0.28,0.37,0.09,0.18,1.2,0.55,0,0.46,0.09,0,19.67,5.26,5.45,0.09,0.37,0.09,0,1.2,0.92,5.72,0,0.55
aokidd,Finally divorced from abusive ex-wife. I’ve got some insane videos I’d like to use as part of a speech on domestic violence for men and shine a light on the other side of the coin. Advice needed regarding moving forward.,"We were married from late 2016 until January this year but have known each other since 2004. It started when we got back from our honeymoon and she sucker punched me for calling her out on a lie. So, I started recording everything I possibly could when I could see things turning for the worse. 

 A few months after we got back from our honeymoon, I caught her in another lie and she got in a good right hook on my nose. A few minutes later she admits she cheated and wants to move past it. This whole exchange is videoed, including her pulling a knife on me and running into the street threatening to kill herself and a whole slew of other instances. 

 Not only is it embarrassing coming to work with a bruised up face, but she knew I would never hit her back. Partly due to my upbringing, mostly because “I don’t key my own car” and I knew if I did I would lose the game no matter what she had done up until that point. It didn’t stop her from harming herself and telling our friends and her people that I did it. Luckily I have her trying to choke herself and banging her head off a wall and other videos of insanity to back me up that she will do anything and play as dirty as she can including emotional and financial abuse, which is a novel in and of itself. 
 
It took a while to get the funds together to get free after moving halfway across the country for her and enough failed attempts at reconciliation to give up. Lawyers weren’t much help considering I’m a 6’3 and 190 pounds ex-serviceman and she’s 5’3 and 130 pounds, but, they said it’s a bad deal all around and good luck. 

 Being diligent and exercising the utmost in self control is what kept me out of jail, especially when she started dating a LEO while we were married and still living in the same house. 

 Supposedly, the statute of limitations for three counts of violence within a one year time frame is three years. I’m still within that timeframe, however, my main concern and primary objective is to get my experience out there so that maybe I can keep another man from ruining his life over a girl and getting locked away in a box. None of my support system had any clue on how to deal with something like that and I was left to figure it out by myself. I was told by my expensive lawyer to keep being a good boy and keep my mouth shut until the divorce was finalized. 

 So, now that the papers are signed and filed, what platforms/outlets/avenues would be best suited to my endeavor? I had thought about just piecing together a highlight reel and dropping it on social media/YouTube/sending it to her sponsors and employers/etc.. I know I’d get instant gratification from taking the low road but I’d rather capitalize on the material and help someone else out there who’s battling on their own.

 Thanks.",witchhuntinprogress,2019-02-08 12:08:58,8,568,54.02,61.78,55.5,10.29,23.67,17.08,90.32,57.92,18.49,12.15,6.34,1.23,0,4.23,0.35,6.34,5.99,15.67,7.57,4.93,8.98,1.23,16.2,2.99,1.94,1.58,1.94,2.46,5.11,1.94,3.17,0.35,1.23,0.7,11.97,1.23,0.18,4.4,0.7,9.51,1.76,0.88,1.58,2.46,0.7,2.64,1.76,1.06,0.35,0,1.41,0.7,0.7,0,0,10.92,3.7,1.76,2.82,2.82,1.23,5.46,7.04,0.53,16.9,1.76,9.15,7.04,1.58,1.76,0.35,1.06,0,0.18,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,10.92,4.23,2.46,0,0,0.18,0,0.35,0.35,2.46,0,0.88
aol7y1,I don't know who I am anymore. I am just venting.,"He's abusive.  And every time things escalate and I think THIS IS IT AND I AM DONE... he turns into the person I thought he was, or want him to be, and I have hope we can make it.  It obviously doesn't last.  

This is one of those typical situations where I thought he was different than the guys I dated in my past.  And it was an over-correction from the guy I dated before him, who was boring and structured and older.  

I am 10 years older than my boyfriend.  I give excuses for his behavior.  ""Oh it's because he's younger and still reckless, and you remember what it was like at that age.""  

4 out of 6 times, this guy is loving, affectionate, attentive, but a little too needy. 2 out of the 6 times, he's angry, abusive, so out of control with his anger he cannot speak without spit flying out of his mouth.  He is argumentative and when we are in public 9/10 times he is combative with a stranger. 

WHO AM I AND HOW DID THIS ALL OF A SUDDEN BECOME OK?  It's not OK, but I just accept it?  This guy has spit on me, called me a dumb-ass bitch, retarded, pushed me, pulled me around by my hair, punched and kneed me, wrapped his hands around my throat.  I have jumped out of a moving car because he has threatened to beat my ass. He will threaten to hurt my dog if I imply he is already being abusive to him.  I downplay my emotions and my reactions to a lot of things as to not feed into his aggression, but sometimes he can tell what I'm doing.

The most severe of this abuse is usually when he is under the influence of alcohol, but it has happened while he is sober.  

The thing is, I am aware of how bad this is.  I am aware that he manipulates me with guilt, tells me I am the only one who believes in him, while everyone has changed up. Adding to the pressure of how I can't leave him. I know that I am better off without him.  That he leeches off me.  I stay because I am stupid and think if I show him all the love, he can change.  I just need to be patient? HA!  BUT I CANT STAND IT!  And I fantasize about leaving him.  I make plans in my head on how I will live a better life as soon as I can get away from him.  I've tried to break up with him in the past but he refuses to leave our home when I do.  Sometimes I just want to up and move to a whole different area to escape.  Just disappear.

I hate talking to people about this because I can see it in their face or already sense it coming ""why don't you just leave"". Isn't it that easy?  

Ive read many posts on here that I can relate to, and it helps to know I am not alone and not crazy, but it hurts me to know that other's go through the same physical/verbal/emotional abuse.  It's a total mind fuxk. And I hope we all make it out.

aopxm7,"Survivors, How Long Before You Could Start Dating Again?","It’s been nearly 6 months since I got out of my DV situation. I’m still dealing w the baggage today, and I’m constantly paranoid and blocking his friends, family, etc.

That being said, I no longer have nightmares and can get to sleep and stop thinking about what I went through when I want to. 

I’ve recently tried to get back on the dating scene but I can’t help but be so disinterested in men. I want to be able to date again as I’ve mostly healed but I just cannnn’t and I don’t know why. I chicken out. I still feel numb. I’ll get the butterflies but they no longer feel that good or intoxicating. I don’t know if it’s the people I talk to or me but I honestly am just not into it BUT I SO WANT TO BE!

And now instead of just looking for red flags I hyper analyze everything a guy says which leads me to lose interest fast. 

How long did it take you before you were able to date again, with your heart, body, mind and soul truly engaged?",Xscorexx,2019-02-08 22:45:09,5,196,8.35,20.71,98.84,54.59,16.33,12.24,91.84,61.73,19.39,14.8,11.73,0,2.04,0.51,0.51,4.59,2.55,12.24,10.2,11.22,11.22,3.06,20.41,3.57,3.06,3.06,0.51,0,4.59,3.06,1.53,0.51,0,0.51,10.71,0.51,2.04,0,1.53,15.82,3.06,2.55,2.55,2.55,1.02,6.12,3.57,1.02,1.02,1.02,3.06,1.53,1.02,0,0.51,9.18,2.55,3.06,1.02,3.06,1.02,4.08,16.33,0.51,16.84,1.53,5.1,11.22,1.02,0.51,0.51,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.82,4.59,4.08,0,0,1.02,0.51,0,0,5.61,0,0
aotjge,Plea to myself and husband,"Throwaway because caution, he reddits sometimes. I get the feeling this may be the wrong place to post but the relationship subreddit always feels so hostile so I am here. 

He has blown up at me about a handful of times, no physical violence but the verbal abuse gets spiteful and insidiously manipulative. Something about the most recent event finally struck a chord in me. I think it was when he calmed down and apologized and admitted many of the things he said were wrong. I cried over fear of abandonment, he reassured me we are in it ""til the end"" and I now have  mixed feelings about it. I came to realize last night that our marriage of 15 years (today is anniversary, fancy huh?) is or has been developing an abusive dynamic that I still don't want to admit to. 

I wrote down some thoughts last night when it hit me and caused a panic attack. I tend to forget things when I panic, hence the need to write despite the sloppiness and incoherency. Now I feel a growing urge to delete it and I know that's not ok. I must put it somewhere to make it more real. My experience is valid. My feelings are real. I need to believe this but I won't if I keep erasing things from my mind.

...

On thursday you yelled. It was not just raising your voice like you keep saying trying to convince both of us, it was yelling. And then I hid and abandonment issues and I Love You. You said togethet to the end and i was content now terrified. We are in an abusive relatiionship have been and it needs to stop please how do we stop? So cold ca t think shaking breath breath breath how do we stop i need to be stronger.

I need to believs i can be okay without what i want. I can believe that. I need to stand up for myself. I want to when these events happen. Why dont i? How can you make yourself love someone who is so weak? I dont want to give up. I feel like i let this happen and i want to fix it. We have been good people. We are still most times. This doesn't define us yet. But we are changing into something toxic and we need to change back. I know you have tried but you give up. Why? And this doesnt mean everything changes now. but the emotional abuse does need to stop now. Youre not just an asshole, youre an abusive asshole. I am not just anxious, im codependent af. We need to call it what it is. We need to change to something healthy. We need help to make it better. Or learn earnestly to communicate before a blowout happens again. Am i crazy to think it can cjange? I Love You. and i dont think that will change. Another shaking spell. This is not healthy for either of us and i know you dont want it like this either. Do you? Is it comfortable? Please keep being active in the  house i thinnk thats a huge step this is not patronizing Idont want to exist like this. It doesnt define Us. Please don't be mad. But it needs to stop. What can i do?? I keep thinking I should be angry but I'm not. Just sad and scared and lost. Pathetic. I need to change, to be stronger and not afraid when you yell. It shuts everything down inside me. We know people and resources. Why can't we reach out to them? Where do we start? We.

aouhur,I need resources to keep me and my daughter safe when her mentally unstable father falls in to a delusional psychosis...,"This is copy-pasted from the post I was making for r/relationships, and the moderators pointed me here and a few other subs. I don't really have the time to figure out where to post, I just need some further advice on how I can get a phone, where I can go, etc.  

I love my boyfriend. That's what they all say right? When he is ""normal"" he is amazing, when he is bad, it's awful. It has never been physical, he is extremely controlling, to the point that I lost all of my friends and had a falling out with my family and they have basically disowned me. I was at a point that I was lost and he was the only person there for me and I let him control me because the constant accusations that I'm cheating or lying about things was too much to handle, it was easier to be controlled, if that makes sense.

We have a 17month old now. He was in a mental institution for the past week, came home with all these wonderful ideas of how he was going to work towards being healthy, how I was going to work more online and he wasn't going to prevent me from being independent...but a few hours after he came home it was constant accusations about me lying and that I that I had definitely cheated on him which turned in to I'm pregnant with another man's baby (when I literally don't even have female friends because of him).

Anyway, he's heading back to the mental hospital today (he's in the ER under GUARD) that's how serious it is. I spoke with his psychologist for awhile this morning and he is going to find me a psychotherapist I can go see and recommended I password lock my electronics, hide my car keys in case I ever need to leave and have a safe room I can lock me and my daughter in, in the future.

My question is, if I'm in this situation again, where I have a young daughter and her mentally unstable father is completely off his rocker, where do I take her? I have very little money, no family/friends. Just my bf's family, which I know I can always go to his parents or brother's house, but like last night, his parents left the country and even if I was able to take my daughter and leave (he wasn't letting me), where would we go? Last night we were going to go to his brothers had my bf let us leave, but he physically blocked the exits and terrorized our daughter (he has never been mean or scary with her - just in front of her) and I am distraught. I get he has a mental illness, and I've already given up so much of myself to cater to his anxiety, but I know now that was WRONG. My biggest thing is, I don't have a cell phone (i have an iphone and laptop I can access wifi) and I share my a bank account with my boyfriend and his disability payments are much larger than my pension payment so he controls the money - although I have my own ATM card and the checkbook.

I did sign up for one of those obama-phone things a few years ago and got the phone but of course BF never let me activate it. If anyone can give me some practical advice, resources, etc. I would really appreciate it.

The one thing I'm going to do, that I haven't done yet is pack a ""go-bag"" to hide somewhere for me and my daughter in case this would happen again.

TL;DR - bf has paranoid delusions, and out of control anxiety, keeps trying to get help and get better, but his aggressive outbursts have me in fear for my daughter's mental health (and mine!) and i need to know what my options are, and what I need to do to protect me and my daughter when he's in a psychotic episode.",mrsuncensored,2019-02-09 09:39:12,6,701,15.13,40.42,68.09,12.52,29.21,14.41,93.15,62.2,22.54,17.4,11.55,0.71,0,4.85,0.29,4.99,4.85,10.98,12.13,6.85,8.27,1.43,18.54,4.42,1.28,2.71,0.29,1.85,4.14,1.57,2.57,1,0.71,0.29,12.84,2.71,1.28,2,5.71,10.13,1.43,2.14,1.71,2,1.57,3,1.14,0.14,0.86,0,1.14,0,1,0.14,0,8.84,3.42,1.28,1.85,1.28,1.28,4.85,13.27,1.14,14.41,3.14,5.99,5.14,1.71,0.43,1,1.28,0,0,1,0,0.71,0,0.14,0.14,15.55,3.57,4.85,0,0.14,0.43,0.14,0.86,0.57,3,1.71,0.29
aovq00,From someone who witnessed domestic violence for fourteen years between his parents and the escape.,"The bus ride-- The smell of weed smoke, the sound of new ways curse words were used in a sentence--all were surreal to them. They were young. They were afraid. Well, except for the baby. All he knew was that he was on a trip. Little did he know the 13-hour bus ride would change the focus of him and his brothers forever. 

The red house, the front yard basketball goal, the biking of the hills, and  the seeming sweetness of urban-suburbia was a deleterious habitat that could destroy. And they ran away as fast as they could. 

Escaping from violence was the easy part. The handling of the aftereffects had so many complexities that the spider nest they were trapped in is still being unwoven.

The formative years can shape a life. However, don't believe that it will make your life. We all struggle. We all are complex individuals who have encountered the good, the bad, the ugly, and the ugliest. Some of us look like absolute winners, but internally, our ships are veering toward icebergs.

However, we have the tools to steer our way from destruction. There are people you can talk too. Groups you can join. Hotlines you can call.

ap6vwo,My (F23) boyfriend (M25) has anger issues.,"I was told to post this here from r/relationships, because you guys would be able to help me more. I've edited this post a little for clarity.

Hello all, posting from a throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my main reddit. Warning, this is a long post.
My boyfriend and I have known each other for 9 years, have been dating for 6, and have been living together for 3. He's my best friend and I love him. We have been there for each other through some hard stuff. He's always admitted he has anger issues but it's never really affected me before, as it comes out as mild road rage. 

The trouble started about a year ago, in January 2018. He travels regularly for work, and just came back from a long trip. We went to a Christmas party together and we both got roaring drunk. I decided I wanted to go home, and told him so. He seemed to agree at first, but then he started getting really aggressive. I don't remember much of what he said specifically, but I think he was trying to shame me into staying longer. I started crying and went outside with some girls from the party following me to wait for my uber and to smoke. He came out a few minutes later and punched my arm. The other girls offered to let me stay in their hotel because I didn't feel safe staying at home, so we went and gathered some stuff and grabbed my dog and I slept at a hotel that night. After I got home the next morning he wasn't even there yet -- turns out he passed out in an abandoned house after leaving the Christmas party in anger. We talked, and he said he would try to stop drinking.

That didn't happen, though. In the next 8 months he got super drunk and aggressive 4 more times. Every time he would threaten to leave after yelling at me. I wouldn't have stopped him if we wasn't drunk, as he would have left in his car or on his motercycle. One time he had been dropped off by his friends and when they left he went to say goodbye through the door and our dog ran out. When we got him back in he hit the dog, and I accidently pushed him while trying to get him to bed and he freaked out, wrestled me to the ground, and slapped me.
After the last time he got drunk in august, he said he was going to slow down on drinking. He admitted he was depressed and was using alcohol as a coping mechanism. We made rules, got rid of the liquor in the house, and stopped going out. Since then we have been fine.

The incident that prompted me to write this post was different though. He wasn't drunk, and it wasn't about me. Two weeks ago, in the morning before going to work he was trying to play with our dog. Looking back on it, it was clear the dog wasn't into it. Neither of us noticed, though, and the dog eventually retaliated and bit my boyfriend on the arm. He hit the dog a couple times and I sent both of our dogs to our bedroom so he could calm down. 

I was focused on finding out if there was something wrong with our dog that caused him to get to aggressive, since he's usually a big baby, and my boyfriend was hurt that I didn't tend to him first. He threatened to kill our dog if he ever did that again. When we talked that night I apologized. He mentioned that he smelled pee that morning, so we're thinking that our dog was afraid of getting punished, which is why he lashed out.

The problem I have is his threat. What happened that morning made me realize that his anger issues are real, and they aren't mild. I started to worry about our future children, and what he would do if they hurt him, whether accidentally or on purpose. I realized that I can't build my life with some one I can't trust to control themselves.

He's travelling right now and will be back Thursday. I would love advice. and also I would like some outside perspective on this whole situation. During these last few weeks I've imagined that if I told anyone what has happened, as described above, they would tell me to leave him. Because of what r/relationships told me, I'm going to my parent's for the day to talk to them about everything. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

TL:DR: Boyfriend has anger issues when he's drunk. The drinking stopped, but the anger issues have not. A recent incident has made me question my own safety and the safety of any future children. Perspective and advice are welcome.

I want to clarify though that we have two dogs, one in my name and one in his. The dog he threated to kill was in his name. I would absolutely take both, but I'm afraid that by boyfriend would try to take him back. How would I be able to take him legally?",anger_2019,2019-02-10 10:46:17,2,880,32.58,73.4,64.91,7.43,15.17,14.77,93.86,58.3,21.59,16.82,6.82,2.39,0.23,6.59,0.8,4.77,4.2,13.86,8.98,4.77,8.18,1.82,20.45,4.2,2.16,1.48,1.59,2.39,5.68,2.05,3.64,0.91,2.05,0.57,16.48,0.23,1.14,0.23,7.5,12.61,2.27,1.82,2.39,2.61,1.02,4.09,1.48,0.23,0.57,0.57,2.39,0.45,0.45,0,1.36,11.48,5.11,1.7,2.05,1.7,1.82,8.98,8.07,1.14,19.09,3.3,7.5,8.86,0.57,2.16,0.91,0.11,0.23,0.23,0.68,0.11,0.34,0.23,0,0,15,6.36,4.43,0.23,0,0.11,0.11,0.23,0,2.84,0.45,0.23
ap78tq,"It's not the first time but at the same time, it is","I've been pretty scared and spacing out all day from the trauma.

early yesterday, my partner made a joke about sucking my toe when he was rubbing my feet. it brought horrible flashbacks of my ex doing that to me without my consent and I said to not joke like that, it'll bring back awful memories. he asked what, and I told him. he got upset that I said that.

later, we had a great time at our friends house and partied with everyone. our friend, who didn't drink, dropped us off at home. he started having sex with me the second we walked in then said he wanted to move it to the bed. we ran to it and had sex, but him being drunk, got soft and couldn't continue, which was okay. I tried moving him to go to my side of the bed and he ended up falling and hitting his head on the night stand, which was NOT my intention. he got belligerent and was angry. 

he starts calling me a liar for the toe sucking by my ex from years ago before him. my partner lied to me for our entire relationship and marriage that there was another girl before me, he constantly lied about this call girl. I kept trying to tell him that I never lied, he never asked about it like i asked about the other girl. he kept screaming over me. I tried and tried and I threw a light book at his direction and asked to just hear me out. it got worse and he ended up punching my shoulder so hard i started bleeding and grabbed me and threw me across the room, my elbow smashing the doorknob. i don't know if it's fractured, all i know is it's heavily bruised and hurts so bad. 

things clear up i guess. he starts having sex with me again and he was going so fast and hard, it went into my butt and I screamed out in pain because it really hurt, i've never done anal, and it was the most painful thing i've felt. i screamed for a solid 8 seconds and at  first he asked if i was okay, and then called me dramatic and said he didn't care for my health, and stormed out. 

I limped and followed him and he was just on his laptop, playing games. i got angry and threw a plastic water bottle (half full) in his direction and hit his head. i felt so awful and started apologizing and i got attacked again. i was on the floor and crying as he spouted for 10 minutes how shitty i am and how shitty women are. i eventually sat up and i don't remember why but he started kicking the shit out of me. 


i slept alone that night. and he came in the next morning and he was crying. 

he's never done this shit to me. but he has hit me before. just not this bad. i can't even cry, i just feel numb.",wickedhentailord,2019-02-10 11:19:54,0,523,16.12,40.94,76.98,1,15.85,11.85,96.37,60.42,24.86,18.74,10.9,1.34,0,6.5,0,6.12,4.02,11.66,7.27,5.35,10.13,2.87,21.22,4.59,1.91,1.53,1.15,0.96,7.65,1.72,5.93,0.57,2.1,1.15,14.15,0.19,0.76,0.76,6.5,8.41,1.34,1.15,0.76,1.15,1.72,3.06,4.4,0.38,1.53,2.49,4.78,3.06,0.76,0.57,0.57,7.27,2.87,1.15,1.34,1.34,0.57,12.81,5.54,0.96,17.4,3.06,6.5,8.22,0.38,1.72,1.15,0,0,0,1.72,0.96,0,0.38,0,0,13.38,6.12,4.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.68,0.38,0
ap8vmb,I am (29F) in an abusive relationship with 27M. After the abuse he acts like nothing happened. But it KILLS ME slowly. Please help,"I don't know how to help myself.. I don't know how to leave him. I know it is my abused, depressed brain is talking but I still love him and hope him to change. But last days, I totally lost my hope, I feel in a very dark place and I don't have any option but leave him. 
Everything started with he is chatting/sexting girls online. I know it is my fault. I had to let him go when I first found it out year ago. But he every time talked me through with it. That he just needs attention and he is JUST fishing online. Nothing more. He never meets them (he is at home all the time, he doesn't have really money or energy to meet them. He is also a heavy cannabis user, so it's unlikely he leaves home). But of course what he is doing was never okay for me. And he never actually stopped. He just hides better. Or lies better. Manipulates better every time. I am aware of everything. But I grew weak and weak. Then through time, I got clingy, depressed, isolated from everyone.. I basically lost my senses. I don't know myself anymore. I was such a brave woman full of life.. I was a scientist (I quit my job because of my depression), I am far away from my family (different country), I have just some close friends here but we have been through this drama too long, nobody wants to hear anything about it anymore. Or I don't wanna involve them anymore as long as I am TRULY ready to leave him for good.
Because we broke up so many times, but it was always so horrible. We missed each other and always ended up again.
But his dark side I believe goes in deep I found out last days. He is kind a living a double life. He is registered into 5267291916 dating and porn Web sites, in each Web site he messaged at least 100 women (just some replied..) He has kik, Snapchat, fake emails, hundreds women all around world with nudes.. Every time I am out of the door, he does that... And he is describing himself differently to the women. I even found in his kik history some very very disturbing porn (I believe even some can be illegal) but he says someone else shared that Dropbox folder. It is not his. I am too disgusted to go back on his account and check again.. And he probably changed his passwords already..
I am paralysed and shocked.. I always thought he really does that for attention, innocent chat.. However, it seems much much darker and compulsory than I thought. It is like he is addicted totally. And he talks and gives excuses and manipulates like an addict. (""that's the last time I swear"" etc..) and when he has no options or I am too agitated when I find his lies: He gets violent. 
I don't know who he is anymore. But still I don't find the strength to pack my things and leave forever. When I am trying to talk with my all senses and love (""baby we can help you. Let's go to doctors."") he gets angry. He says I am the reason he does that. But when he calms down, he admits he was like this before me, too.. I developed very unhealthy coping mechanism to keep him close to me all the time, then he won't do it. But of course it is not a solution nor healthy. After a while, because he can not get this addiction out of his system, he starts fights and violence to kick me out the apartment in order to have his ""peace"". But actually what he does is going back to dark hole of internet. Then when I am back home, he is nice to me again.
I can write until the morning how f*cked up the situation is. I know that I have also lots of faults. I had to leave him, I couldn't. Now I lost everything and I am depressed and anxious as f*ck.. I don't know what to do.. The only thing is my head is hurting because he pulled my hair.. And all the things I saw.. And I feel so abused so consumed.. . I just lay down in the bed like a zombi, numb myself with his pot and trying to forget just some minutes what type of hell I am in.. And he is like the devil, hugs me after every abuse, apologies and be the nicest person in the world.. He turns on Netflix, make food to feed me, roll a J and cuddle me.. Like nothing happened or will happen again..
But it happens, always happens.
I am thinking to go to a hotel while he was at work. Or should I go to a doctor tomorrow directly to put me into a rehabilitation center?
It is just.. Once I have the step, I don't wanna go back. But after few days or even hours, I feel like the devil is poking.. To go back to him. (then I understand how he feels when he commits me not to do it again.. But probably the devil is poking him to go to the dark side..then goes back his secret life, like I do.. I go back to him and hide it from my parents and majority of my friends. It is like I am also THE ONE having a double life! ) can you see how I toxicate myself as staying in this relationship for 1,5years?? 
How can I save myself from this circle of death? 
I am aware of everything, just paralysed to do anything.. 

PS. I am financially independent. I have money. He was the one without money. We lived on my money/savings for months, now finally he has a job.

TL;DR : I am 29F and in an abusive relationship with 27M for 1,5 years.. He has compulsory sybersex addiction. I don't know how to leave him for good because he is abusing to keep both me and his addiction. After the abuse, we always act like nothing happened..it kills me slowly and I can't ignore it anymore!",PoisonousIvyyy,2019-02-10 13:49:20,3,1075,14.11,39,72.85,6.86,11.32,12.93,95.26,62.33,22.51,17.4,9.58,0.65,0.19,6.7,0.28,5.12,3.91,11.63,9.86,7.35,9.12,2.7,18.51,3.16,2.79,1.77,1.12,2.6,6.33,2.33,4,0.28,1.58,1.02,12.65,0.28,0.19,0.47,6.7,14.14,3.26,1.86,0.74,2.51,2.98,3.91,1.77,0.74,0.28,0.56,2.88,0.28,1.95,0.37,0.19,6.33,2.79,1.12,1.67,0.84,0.47,3.16,14.88,1.3,15.35,2.79,5.49,7.91,1.12,0.74,0.65,0.65,0.37,0.28,0.65,0.09,0.28,0.09,0,0,20.09,11.35,3.72,0.19,0.09,0.37,0.19,0,0.56,1.58,1.67,0.37
apada6,VENT: I think my(f 20s) boyfriend (m 30s) dislocated my jaw last night (trigger warning for violence),"Last night, my boyfriend and I invited his cousin to our house for the first time in almost two years. Cousin is a heavy drug user and overall bad news. Boyfriend is worried cousin might die soon, so he wanted to see his family. 

Anyway, as we were hanging out, drinking some beer, boyfriend starts to get emotionally abusive. I tell him to cut it out. He keeps saying I'm trying to be a ""tough guy"". Totally not. 

Eventually, cousin begins talking about his parents and grandparents. Everything they had been through, etc. something about smacking women around comes up, how it was normal then, idk. Anyway, boyfriend comes behind me and yanks my head back hard from my head. I react (as this was a surprise) and my hand flew up behind me and slapped his face. (Again, would never do this if he hadn't scared me). Boyfriend then smacks me hard in the face, then does it a second time so hard I fell out of dining room chair. 

I go upstairs out of embarrassment, crying. He comes upstairs screaming that I hurt him. Hits me two more times very hard. On the last one I feel extreme pain in my jaw. I beg him to stop, I thought something broke. He gets in my face and calls me a pussy and a liar. Starts belittling me about how I thought I had appendicitis last week (HE convinced me I had it. Actually just a pulled muscle). Then he starts telling me I need to man up and come back downstairs. That men fight all the time and get back to drinking etc. that if I want equal rights so badly (I'm a social science researcher specifically in gender studies. He turns everything into how women want to be men basically which is blatantly not true). I refuse. He pushes me on the bed and takes me phone. 

I go downstairs and ask for my phone so I can leave. He said he already smashed it outside and threw it over the fence. Obviously that was a lie as I am on my phone now, but for an hour he convinced me he smashed my phone and that it was my fault. Eventually I get out of the house after he tries cornering me and pushing me in various rooms around the house. 

I really just needed to vent. I have been so depressed lately and this just made the hole deeper. I need to leave him, but like a lot of women I have so many ties to him.

apbad0,I've been safe for 3 years,"It is possible to get out. He beat me, broke me, and gave me a few seizures. I remember every foul word, especially on bad days. I remember every punch to the face. Every broken bone, but I left. I got out. It wasn't a normal way out like planning and leaving while he was gone. It was sneaking out while he was in prison, bc his mother was also abusing me. I still got letters after I called the prison telling them I didn't want them. They didn't care. I had given almost my entire life to him, but now he doesn't have it. His abusive mother doesn't either. I tell them when they can see my daughter  bc they are the fuck ups, not me, not you. It's them, they enable saditistic behavior.

ape54y,My now ex-girlfriend (22F) punched me (23M) in the face multiple times this weekend.,"I always knew that she had a fiery side to her, but this was completely unexpected. 

I am in my final year of college (graduate school) &amp; had plans to have a future with her after graduating this upcoming May. This past weekend was a large get together at my college that had my roommates &amp; I hosting many of our friends we made during our undergrad years. My girlfriend, who also graduated undergrad at this college with me, was never extremely close with these friends of mine, but nonetheless it was never a big deal. 

As we went to turn in after a long fun night of drinking she snarkly says to me, “If I were to go through your phone I wouldn’t find anything I don’t like right?” &amp; of course knowing I couldn’t &amp; wouldn’t ever do anything behind her back I said sure go right ahead. After she picks apart some non-flirtatious but joking manner conversations between a friend of mine who still goes to school here with me (23F) she began to lose it. Knowing I hadn’t done anything wrong &amp; didn’t want to be yelled at for doing nothing wrong I decided to go downstairs to freshen up then rejoin the situation, giving her the space to cool down &amp; level out. 

As I’m going to the bathroom, she opens the door with a rage in her eye like I’ve never seen, &amp; suckers me on the chin. Stunned, I stumble back as I’m met with more punches in the face &amp; finally shoved into the wall as she’s screaming at me about a random message in my phone she didn’t like. When she was done I was motionless, left in disbelief over what had just happened. I calmly told her to go upstairs &amp; as soon as I got back in my room I got dressed &amp; left my house to sleep at another friends house (22M)

I called my father the next morning to ask for advice because I’ve never dealt with anything like this &amp; it’s not something that happens all that commonly. His candid response, in which I agreed to, was to “Cut her loose”. 

When I returned I was met with apologies &amp; I love you’s but I couldn’t even look at this girl I had fallen in with love. Excuse me if this sounds mean but she looked so ugly to me it hurt. After she poured out emotions I eventually told her she had to leave &amp; that we were through. I wasn’t going to be a part of a relationship where something like this is going to be tolerated.

My biggest issue I guess is moving forward because I feel so stuck, &amp; hurt by the whole thing. She didn’t leave any bad bruises &amp; none of the punches truly hurt me on a physical level, but I still recall the 30 second encounter so vividly I can feel the punches landing still. &amp; all the while I still really care for this girl, but I don’t want to be a part of an abusive relationship.

apej6y,All I want to do is talk to him?,"I (21F) broke up with my boyfriend just over a week ago. He sexually assaulted and raped me among other things that others are helping me realize weren't ok. I have been having a really hard time. I've been very depressed, not going to class, drinking a lot every night. Last night I heard through a friend that my ex has started going to therapy. A lot of guilt is setting in. I think a lot about contacting him because I feel like I owe it to him to discuss things, even though I already explained everything I could explain during the break up conversation. I also miss him so much. The whole time during our relationship, he was the one I went to for comfort when I was upset about the things he did to me. I was so dependent on him and now I feel very lost. He made me feel so guilty during the break up and I feel I owe him more than that. But also I'm afraid that if I contact him he'll just pull me right back in, and I know it was an unhealthy relationship. I worried that now since he's going to therapy people think I'm a bitch for what I did to him, even though most of my friends have been very supportive.

This was kind of stream of consciousness rambling but does anyone know how I can deal with this guilt and feelings of needing and missing him? I'm struggling a lot with this whole situation.

apelrh,My (24M) boyfriend grabbed my face and yelled at me (20F),"BACKGROUND INFO: I've known my boyfriend for 2 years. We met online. We are in a long distance relationship. We met a year ago in person and I've traveled 6 times during 2018 to see him. It was always weekend trips or week long trips to see him. But I finally got a chance to spend the month with him. 

During the month, I was at home majority of the time because it was cold outside and I was scared to take public transportation because I was afraid to get lost. We got to go out a couple of times a week but it was after he got off of work (he works 9am-6pm). So he was extremely tired from work but he was nice enough to grab dinner with me even though he wanted to get some sleep.
Being at home all the time and waiting for him and having no friends or places to go made me bored. The whole reason I went to see him for a month is to get to know him better. 

MAIN POINT: Towards the end of of the month before I had to leave, one night, I really wanted to spend more time with him even though he had work the next morning. I disliked how he came home sometimes and didn't speak to me. He would be on his phone playing video games. 
So that one night I kept trying to talk to him while he was trying to sleep and have him stay up a little more. THATS WHEN he got up, GRABBED my face with both hands, and yelled ""I GOT responsibility. I don't want you to spend the summer with me. I don't like living with you! I can't take care of you (he always offered to pay), its too much!""

I started crying in shock. I didnt know exactly what to say. So i cried. Of course he held me until I stopped crying but I feel like he did that just so he can go to sleep. I told him that he shouldn't yell at me like that and grab my face. 
I feel like he should've told me if he was having financial problems.

What do you guys think?
This is the first time he's ever yelled at me like this.

tl;dr my boyfriend grabbed my face and yelled at me, what do I do?",seewhatilike,2019-02-11 01:35:31,5,413,42.14,52.91,64.6,3.16,14.24,8.47,97.09,58.6,22.03,18.64,9.69,0.97,0.97,7.02,0,3.39,4.12,15.5,8.72,3.87,7.02,1.69,24.94,2.66,2.18,1.21,1.45,2.18,4.84,1.21,3.63,0.48,1.21,0.97,13.32,0,1.21,0,7.99,10.41,1.94,1.21,1.94,1.94,1.45,3.15,5.08,0.97,1.94,2.18,2.91,1.94,0.73,0,0.24,8.72,2.91,2.18,0.73,2.66,0.48,10.65,11.38,0,17.43,2.66,5.81,9.2,1.94,1.21,0.73,1.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.29,5.81,1.69,0.48,0.24,0.48,0.48,0.24,0.48,2.42,1.94,0
apenls,Dad says that all I do is cause problems and ruin everything,"My parents have been separated for almost ten years now, but my dad still comes around to help out. My childhood was filled with him emotionally, verbally, and physically abusing my mom and I. When I was little my mom tried very hard for a long time to get us away, but he would get violent if we tried to leave - comparable to the movie ‘not without my daughter’ - We eventually left and he stayed present in my life. He knows nothing about me and treats me like I’m about ten years old as well as tells me over and over that I’m severely autistic and developmentally delayed (he uses the r word). He also constantly gaslights all of the memories I have of him abusing me and my mom, telling me that my feeble brain is too impressionable and I’ve been brainwashed or that I was too little to have a memory even though I was between the ages of five and thirteen when these things occurred and remember things such as him choking her, punching her, breaking plates and cups, slamming my head into the corner of a bookcase, grabbing the hood of my coat and slamming me on the ground so hard a passerby followed me as I ran away to ask if he needed to call 911 or someone, etc. Recently he’s began telling me that I caused his marriage to fall apart and anytime my mom and him fight he says that I caused it. For example, tonight he was staying over and I asked him to please not hover in the kitchen and he immediately snapped, yelling and screaming about how I am the problem and all my mom does is listen to my side and protect me and never him. What really bothers me is that this happens a lot and if I tell him not to do something, not to hug or touch me, that I don’t want to go somewhere with him, or really any form of no he gets very angry and says that he doesn’t have to listen to me because I’m a “child” and have no say in anything. Even if my mom tells him no he does it anyway because he says he doesn’t have to follow rules. That aside, he always says I ruin everything and am a horrible. horrible person who does nothing but manipulate and create problems. This happens so often and anytime he gets called out for doing something wrong, it ends up being someone else’s fault and never his. Now my moms sleeping in my room because he won’t leave the house. My moms finally thinking of getting a order of protection against him. I don’t know if it’s even right to cut him off though. It seems harsh, unfair, and mean to do that to my own father. 

Am I the problem here?

apfs13,It Gets Better,"It does. I promise. In due time you will heal and look back and see everything you didn’t see because they had their hands over your eyes, blinding you from their lies and manipulation. 

The fact that you are on this forum is a huge step in the right direction. Joining this subreddit was my first step towards leaving my ex-abuser. I would scroll for hours, binging on others experiences and the advice other DV survivors would leave them. 

The first step is usually wondering if what you are going/went through is normal. It’s not. 
Abuse can be as small as withholding sex from you to ignoring you to flat out strangulation and assault. Leaving bruises and rape are not the only forms of abuse, they are the most publicized. No matter what it is, if it makes you unhappy then you should leave - even if you love them and they convince you that they love you. “Sorry” does not make up for it. Read that again. SORRY does NOT make up for it. 

I escaped my abuser 183 days ago on August 12, 2018. To be 100% honest, I would still be with him today had he not caused me so much physical damage. The emotional abuse is SO easy to forgive. The manipulation is exactly that - they deceive you so that you think you are the problem; leading to guilt, shame, and self-hatred, while leaving only enough room left inside your heart and mind to love them. That’s why you question “is it really THAT bad to where I should give up this entire relationship?” 
- The answer is yes. You are in a one way relationship and the only way that is going is towards them and their satisfaction/happiness. 

I know it’s hard to see. I like to consider myself pretty strong-minded, which is why I think I can look at it the way I am. But even I was fooled into being this guys puppet for 3 years, letting him do anything and everything. Feel free to skim my previous DV posts, as I made them as I was in the relationship with him, questioning the same things - “was this abuse?”, “does he love me?”, “do I really love him?”

If you have support, please get out. If you don’t have support, please find some. I will post some links below that personally helped me. Please, anyone, feel free to message me. I’m not a counselor or advocate, but I have been through it and have an outside opinion that I’m more than willing to give. 

Best of luck to all of you! Xoxo

apn53l,What was the best thing your friends/family did to help you heal?,"I am SO SO proud of my friend, 

It’s been 2 months since she and her son got OUT. And are safe at a shelter. And in counselling (!). They are now in the long slow healing part of this. There have been many positives but we just found out one of the assault charges against her ex was dropped.  She’s strong but it has her spinning back down the ‘I was wrong’ ‘He was right’ ‘I’m making everything hard’ ‘It’s all my fault’ ‘I’m exaggerating’ etc path in her head again.

I know time/counselling is the best medicine but while she goes through this tough time, is there anything helpful I can do?

appjmd,Is this physical abuse (xpost)?,"Hello all.

I am new to this community, and reddit in general. I am in what I have finally identified as an abusive relationship. Although it's been primarily emotional and verbal abuse--and very insidious instances at that--the domestic violence shelter where I seek counseling has confirmed that it is still abuse. Long story short, my boyfriend is very controlling and easy to anger. His ex-wife claimed their relationship to be abusive, as he would throw and break things when provoked, although never hit her either.

Anyway....something somewhat new has happened, and I would welcome your opinions as to whether or not this is physical or sexual abuse?

My boyfriend, S we can call him, is sexually dominant in bed. I have no problem with this. However, over the past year or so, he has done this thing where he sneaks up to me, pins me against the wall (doesn't fully ""slam"" me, but forces me there), holds me hands while he gyrates into me, then grabs my breasts and genitals with force. He will always bite my neck very hard. It has started making me uncomfortable because he will do it when I'm putting in my contact lenses or something completely ""outside"" of bedroom behavior. It's tricky because I think he thinks he's being playful and keeping our passion alive. But it feels invasive. In the past, he has punished me for trying to stick up for my own physical and emotional boundaries, so I'm too scared to address him. I've softly said ""stop"", usually with a smile to diffuse the situation. This last time it happened, he bit harder and left huge bruises along my leg. So...is he escalating to physical abuse? Or do I need to step up and set more boundaries?",vpetrucci,2019-02-11 20:50:07,4,304,10.11,39.61,63.22,1,15.2,22.37,91.12,59.54,21.38,14.8,8.55,0.66,0.33,4.93,0.33,6.58,2.3,10.86,10.86,7.24,11.18,1.32,15.13,7.24,1.97,1.97,0,1.64,7.24,1.64,5.59,0.66,3.62,0,10.86,0.33,0.99,0.66,5.26,12.83,1.64,2.3,1.32,3.29,1.32,4.61,2.3,0,0.33,1.97,4.28,1.64,1.64,1.64,0,7.57,3.29,0.66,3.29,0,0.66,2.96,10.2,0.99,14.47,1.32,6.58,6.25,0.33,0.66,1.32,0,0,0.33,0.99,0,0.33,0,0,0.33,21.71,7.57,5.59,0,0,1.32,0,1.64,1.97,2.3,1.32,0
appsa5,How to stop being scared?,"Hi, 
I left my abuser 3 years ago and met my wonderful boyfriend 2 years ago, to everyone in bad relationships I promise it gets better!

However, my problem is that I still live in fear he'll come harm me. Whenever I sleep at my parents house, see a car similar to the one he had or that he'll find out where I live.. Doesn't help that I still live in the small town we both grew up in and that I love and don't want to leave out of fear.

Do abusers usually come back or do they move on to the next victim? I know he's been with the same girl for 2 years so is that a good sign for me?

apqsth,Workplace Safety,"A friend at work is planning to leave their physically abusive spouse. They believe that the spouse may show up at work and is likely to be violent. 

Our boss and coworkers are aware of the situation and timeframe, but we work at a very small, easily accessible local business with no sort of security and our boss has not discussed any emergency plan should the abusive spouse turn up. 

I’m very concerned for my friend and, really, for all of us at work and I would be so grateful for any advice about how to best keep everyone safe.

apqx0r,I finally left my emotional abuser of 6 years,"I don’t know how to feel right now. I should be overjoyed. Despite me being miserable with him, and everyday feeling like I was taken down and drained, it was so hard for me to break it off. I was having an emotional breakdown earlier and felt like I was losing my mind about the idea of breaking it off. 
They say when you lose someone you love apart of your soul is taken away. I feel like a part of me is missing but not in the “I lost my soulmate” way. It’s more like, I feel like I lost a limb. He’s consumed so much of my life that I don’t know how to start again. 
At the same time when my best friend held my hand, and I sent that text. An immediate sense of overwhelming relief came over me. My headache I had over this weekend is completely gone, I feel as if my mind is at peace. I’m sorry this was rambling but I’m just sitting here in my hotel room( I wanted to go somewhere safe) my best friend asleep. I had to write this because although I’m scared of what is to come, I’ve never been alone before, I feel content. Thank you for listening.

we’ve been together since i was 18, now I’m 23 and he’s 31. I’m completely financially dependent on him since a couple legal issues put me out of work. going to my parents is not an option, and i don’t have friends in the area who could help or know the extent of how bad it’s gotten.

apyxpa,I’m alone and going through a bad break up,"21 female and my ex (23) lives together for a little short of a year and in the beginning he hit himself with a remote, spoke sexually on Snapchat with a girl , has spit water on me and etc . I started to see a guy , I’ll call him c, he and started talking after a and I broke up and I wasn’t ready for it . It was too soon and he said I love you , we have known each other for a year prior because we work together however , we didn’t pursue anything while I was dating , I’ll call him a, and I told him a and I will be working on things and that was when I found out a cheated on me with a girl from work . So a started staying at family friends house and running around getting hickeys and still had a key to our apartment , and refused to give it back , he left his things here and tried to keep me around . Christmas night we were hanging out and he left to his family’s and came back with a very dark hickey on his neck and his shirt was missing , all he had on were sweatpants and a jacket . I know what he had on because he left with everything he came back with except his shirt . C is very nice and extremely caring and very different than anyone I know . I really just wasn’t ready and I was apprehensive because I’ve been told he falls hard for everyone and c and I never really talked about that . So kept receiving hickeys and sleeping with people where he stayed at and a girl from work . He told this girl from work Things like “I like tasting you off my fingers” and what not and the day he said that , he was over at my house that night because he said he missed me . During all of this I released contact or anybody I had seen to work on things with a because that’s what we said we’d do . Then this girl from work he was seeing popped a tire one day when they had been drinking together at work in the morning and he went to go help her although he was suppose to be at my house and he pulled in but never got out and left and he didn’t tell me where he was until about 40 minutes after he got to wherever she was . I then saw another hickey from her . She apologized to me and it’s extremely weird at work because a was telling me he wasn’t sleeping with her even though he had marks on his neck from her and I tried to believe him but eventually found out the truth . A is narcissistic and has been the whole relationship . I can admit I was bitchy and didn’t trust him after the first girl he talked to on Snapchat . However , he has put his hands on me and recently we drank together maybe about a week ago and he lost his cool and pushed me on the floor and my head was sore and he poure a beer on me outside , my knee got skinned and when we were in a parking lot diagonal from my house , he would leave or turn the car on and he fell asleep on my lap so I offered to drive back and he wouldn’t put the key in the ignition I then got out and tried to walk away but he came running and poured water on me, picked me up and I started to scream so he put his fingers in my mouth and rapidly moved them around . We got back to the house , my hair soaking wet from beer and water , I left my phone in his car which I didn’t put a passcode on it because I had nothing to hide so I hadn’t had one in a few days , he went to go get it and we fall asleep and then I wake up while he was still asleep and I go for my phone but there is a passcode on it . I try so many different variations of old passwords I’ve had but at a point I realized I didn’t put a password on it . A did and when he woke up he unlocked my phone and forgot he even put a password on it thinking I put one on . Today he grabbed somethings , he left one bag and when he walked in the door he pulled a chair next to me on the porch and started touching my breasts and vagina , I told him to stop and he wouldn’t . I went outside so I had witnesses and I was hoping he wouldn’t try anything psychical with me in the open and I stayed out there until he got his stuff . He tried to lure me inside because I asked if that was everything he said “yeah come inside and check !” And I didn’t I asked if he was lying he said no then he calls me a bitch and asks me why can’t we be friends , he admitted to a bag being inside realizing I wasn’t going to go back in until he was gone... he eventually leaves but refused to hand the key back and when I went in there was a bag that he claimed he had nothing in the apartment , sitting on the floor . He says he will give the key tomorrow but I’m thinking he may not and even if he does he could’ve made a copy by now . In the meantime my mom is in another state and I have no family here so I’m alone and he’s well aware of that . I told my mom what happened and she told me to set his things outside when he says he’s coming and to tell him to leave the key at the office . I guess I’m just venting but I’m scared and feel so alone .. thank you for any replies .",sixela1998,2019-02-12 14:04:12,0,1017,19.01,67.44,67.93,19.87,32.81,11.9,94.89,65.98,23.5,19.37,8.75,1.18,0.29,8.95,0.2,4.13,5.6,13.67,8.46,6.29,12,2.26,21.44,2.56,0.79,1.57,0.79,0.98,2.75,1.18,1.57,0.2,0.39,0.69,17.9,0.39,0.39,1.57,8.36,9.34,1.38,1.18,0.88,1.97,1.18,3.64,2.85,0.49,1.28,0.98,3.24,2.06,0.2,0.29,0.79,6.49,2.56,1.77,0.98,0.79,0.49,11.7,6.78,1.77,19.86,4.42,10.03,6.39,0.98,0.98,1.08,0,0.1,0,0.79,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.1,0,9.14,3.15,2.26,0,0,0,0.1,0,0.39,3.05,0.2,0

Our child is still quite young!

aqb6wk,He tells me he hates me but doesn’t let me leave I’m f29 he is M34,"Bit long as need to vent.

So I’ve been with him for 5 years 
It started how it all starts and escalated.

Nearly every week I get something thrown at me, slapped, hit and called names. 

It’s getting worse 


Last night we had an argument as I started to say something to him about taking something back to the shop that cost £1500 as he hadn’t been paid and he went crazy called me a bitch and to fu*k off stop telling him what to do.
I said to him I was only starting to say I’m happy to take it back for you (he refuses to take things back to any stores) tells me again to fu*k off
I leave it 5 minutes get up and playfully go to grab his phone he kicks me, slapped me hard around the face and pushed me. He then smashed up iPad, laptop, and one of his other phones.

I hid in the bathroom. Half an hour later he is calling me a postitue, a bitch and that I’m useless, that I was sucking someone di*k at work and I’m disgusting. He went on and on. He says I ruin his life he had a knife in his hands and kept making motions like he wants to throw it at me. He tells me he wants to hurt me and wait till I see what he will do to me.

This is the man who cheated on me many times and I found out last October he had been cheating with me. The women he cheats on me with are everything that he says he hates. He looks so happy in pictures of him with these women  smiling and flashing money. But when we go out I’m a bitch for wearing a dress and I make him
Ashamed 

when I finally confronted him about the cheating he says it’s not a big deal and to get the fu*k over it. He even looked at one of the photos I showed him as proof as he won’t admit to anything unless there is proof and said “yeah she is very nice” then two days later told me I’m ugly and he is better then me.

It’s like he wants to break me. My confidence is at a all time low, I have bruises on my legs, back and arms from where he dragged me through the house and hit me with a charging cable last week. 

I cry every day and keep breaking down 70% of me wants to kill myself as I can’t stand myself or feeling this anymore as I’m so emotionally hurt and alone.

He tells me everything is my fault . Everything.
I’ve emotionally supported this man for 5 years and gave him my love..

He controls everything I do, I don’t go out I go to work see my parents and stay home. I haven’t been out in over a year. He accuses me of cheating, I’ve never cheated or lied to him.

When I go to leave he changes and begs me not to and won’t leave me alone.

If I make him so unhappy as he tells me every week and I’m disgusting and useless why won’t he let me leave and leave me alone.

It’s like he is keeping me on a sting dangling . He tells me I need him.

Even when I find the courage to go he makes me feel guilty and that no one will love me as I’m
Disgusting. He is playing with my head and when I try to talk to him I am “ruining things” and “stressing HIM” out ... and it’s no big deal.

I see him for what he is but I feel so trapped",fedupofthis-1,2019-02-13 12:38:46,0,646,15.27,43.85,45.22,1,19,10.53,94.74,62.23,27.86,22.14,12.69,0.31,0.15,8.98,0,5.73,3.56,13.78,8.36,4.49,9.91,2.01,21.52,3.87,2.48,1.86,1.55,1.24,7.59,1.86,5.73,0.46,2.48,1.86,15.48,0.15,0,0.46,9.13,8.2,0.93,1.24,1.08,1.7,2.01,1.86,3.87,1.24,1.39,1.24,1.39,0.93,0.15,0,0,6.35,0.77,1.7,2.32,1.39,0.62,4.33,14.86,1.86,14.86,3.1,5.88,6.5,0.46,0.62,0.46,0.77,0,0.15,1.7,0.93,1.08,0.77,0,0,13,5.42,1.7,0,0,0,0,0,0.93,3.87,0.31,0.77

aqc9yd,How Abuse Affects you Years After You've Left,"New here, please advise if I've violated any posting rules.

I've noticed that there is plenty advice to read if you think you're being abused, where to go to seek safety from abuse and a lot on the long term affect of abuse on children.

What I can't seem to find a lot of discussion on is what happens long after the abuse ends. I'm talking decades later. If you're remarried do you still feel the ghost of your past life? Are you too scared to get remarried? Can you see yourself as a survivor of abuse yet?

I'm starting a long-term discussion on the topic of what happens when the abuse stops.

Growing up I didn't realize I was not alone in the abuse I endured. It had never occurred to me that I could have a discussion with others.

To say my mother is messed up from 45 years of abuse, rape and starvation from her husband / my father, is an understatement. She left her husband 5 years ago and the devastating affects are just beginning to show.

I'm reliving our journey online. The story starts 45 years ago and continues to unfold in real time. Sadly, my straight-edged, timid and quiet mother has, seemingly out of nowhere, developed a cocaine addiction. A band-aid to help her live with what is left in her head.

I want this to become a discussion. How are you after all these years? Join me, and contribute to discussion on an uncomfortable journey.

aqfwcu,Having flashbacks,"Hello everyone. I’m looking for advice for those who have long since left their abusive situations but still find themselves thinking about it or having flashbacks to a certain bad night, etc. I’m currently in a healthy, loving relationship with my current partner and he is fully aware of the abuse that I went through while with my ex. It was mainly emotional and mental abuse but he did become physical more than once. I feel like I’m having trouble trusting my partner in certain situations or finding myself hypersensitive/ quick to react to otherwise simple things. For ex . My current man had a towel and playfully rolled it up and hit me on the butt with it as I passed by. (Like in a locker room) It was a funny moment and not malicious at all but for some reason I got so upset bc it reminded me of how my ex would continuously hit me with rolled towels bc he thought it was funny, despite me asking him to stop. Those incidents happened over two years ago, before I even knew my current partner, so I’m just upset and embarrassed that I allowed my ex to affect my present. It’s very confusing for me bc I thought I was over him, yet I’m being triggered by small things like this more often. 

Sorry I started rambling but I was just wondering if anyone could relate.

aqh7z8,Have court next week and an scared.,"Around a year ago I was in mentally and physically abusive relation ship for about four months.  I am 33 year old female and he is 33 year old male. 

When I finally got the nerve to leave him, I went to our place  when he was at work and took my belongings because through texts he told me if I ever left he would smash all my items and cut all my clothes.  

To make a long story short, he asked me to return his keys and when I went he would not let me leave, threaten to stab me if I attempted to left. Said he would lie to the police and have me charged with something or another. Said if I went to the police he would have someone get me and my family , and I would never be able to leave my work safe again, and would have to relocate because he would find me. 

During the time I was there he destroyed my phone, hit me and kicked me repeatedly. Threw glasses at me and smashed them. Yelled at me. I finally managed to escape when he fell asleep around 12 hours later and ran on foot because I had no phone. 

He ended up with many charges and now I have to face him next week in court for a trail and I am scared. I don’t know what to expect. And the person I talked to at victims services was less then helpful and gave me a generic answer to my question.

aqpzt3,When DV Victims Fight Back...,"I feel that people don’t get, mostly the law, domestic violence victims who hit back to defend themselves. Or see physicality as a normal fight in the relationship.

Anyways, while struggling with those feelings I came upon this: 

“Victims of domestic violence do not bring violence upon themselves, they do not always lack self-confidence, nor are they just as abusive as the abuser. Violence in relationships occurs when one person feels entitled to power and control over their partner and chooses to use abuse to gain and maintain that control. In relationships where domestic violence exists, violence is not equal. Even if the victim fights back or instigates violence in an effort to diffuse a situation. There is always one person who is the primary, constant source of power, control, and abuse in the relationship.” [source](https://ncadv.org/dynamics-of-abuse)

aqt0od,Advice on an employer hiring my ex convicted of DV Battery,"A couple of years ago, my boyfriend was arrested for DV. I got state assistance and moved on as best I could. A grocery store opened up that sold locally sourced produce, in-house prepared bacon, etc. It was awesome. By chance, I found out he worked there. I contacted the HR dept for this company and asked what kind of hiring standards they had. I was given the run-around for quite some time before I gave up. This store is great, but my friends won't shop there because he had threatened them all for so long and they are afraid to run into him. I know this corporation may not care that they are losing business of 10ish people, but I'm wondering... what is the threshold to which companies should be held? I am glad he got a job, but I don't know that working at a counter job is a good idea given that I know what he is capable of. After he was arrested, I found out he had many dropped charges of violent nature from many years prior. I've let it go, but what are your thoughts on what companies should hold as a standard? 

&amp;#x200B;

For perspective, this store doesn't sell veal. My friend said when he inquired, they said it is because they are ""cruelty free.""",MisterFasthorse,2019-02-14 20:53:11,5,234,36.88,55.09,43.94,41.21,14.62,16.24,91.45,54.7,20.94,13.68,7.26,0,0.43,3.42,2.56,7.26,4.27,12.39,11.97,2.14,5.56,1.71,23.93,4.7,2.14,2.99,0,2.14,5.13,2.99,2.14,0.85,1.28,0.43,11.97,0,1.28,0,3.85,11.97,4.27,1.71,1.28,2.56,0.43,2.14,0.85,0,0.85,0,0.85,0,0,0,0.85,6.84,1.28,2.14,2.14,2.14,0.85,10.26,9.83,1.28,11.11,1.71,5.98,3.42,6.84,0.43,0.43,3.42,0,0,0.85,0,0,0.43,0,0,17.52,6.41,4.7,0,0.85,0.85,0,0.85,0.85,2.14,0,0.85
aqumva,I need some advice on how to take care of this situation,"First of all I am not the one who gets abused, it’s my boyfriend’s mother, but I stay with them so I see everything that’s happening.
Her husband is an alcoholic and the abuse goes for over 20 years. Right now he is too old and too drunk to abuse her physically and it’s more like a verbal abuse as well as stealing her hard worked money. 
There are a lot of nights where we can’t sleep because of him. He shouts, he swears, he threatens to kill my boyfriend’s mom.
He still tries to hit my bf’s her, but he isn’t as strong as he was and she can easily defend herself. 
I’m instructed to lock myself in a room when I’m alone at home with him for safety reasons. 
Whenever we call the police he plays victim or the police give him a fine which will be payed by us, so it’s useless.  
On the other hand, in our country is kind of hard to get him admitted to a mental hospital unless we can prove he is dangerous (which we can’t prove as he is plays the innocent card when police arrive) or gives his accord to be admitted.
Is there anything else we can do about this situation, we’ve recently started to record him when he starts with the scandal, but other than this we don’t know what we can do?",ariakingstone,2019-02-15 00:43:04,4,246,18.04,88.07,10.32,10.4,22.36,11.38,95.93,62.6,23.98,17.89,4.07,4.07,0,9.35,0.41,6.1,5.28,13.82,10.98,6.5,9.35,2.03,17.89,6.1,3.66,4.07,1.22,1.63,8.54,3.66,4.88,0.41,2.44,0.81,19.51,1.22,1.22,3.25,8.54,11.79,2.44,1.22,0.41,2.44,1.63,5.69,2.03,0.41,0.41,1.22,2.44,0.81,1.22,0,0.81,12.6,5.28,1.22,3.25,1.63,1.63,2.44,16.67,0.41,10.98,1.22,4.47,5.69,2.44,1.63,0.81,0.81,0,0.41,0.41,0,0,0,0.41,0,14.23,3.66,3.66,0,0,0.41,0,0,0,5.69,0.81,0
aqxwh0,I thought he was going to kill me last night...,"This post is mostly for me to vent. This is a throwaway account, so that I can remain anonymous. I know what I should do. But doing it is what is hard.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend (M29) and I (F25) have been living with each other since October. Both of our names are on the lease. I moved out of my parents house and he moved out of a room he was renting. We mostly did it because it made the most sense financially. We've only been together a little over a year. I knew he had issues from the beginning. He struggles with depression and anxiety, but it manifests itself mostly in anger.  I also have depression and anxiety, although mine has been controlled by medication and intermittent therapy for years. He has never seen a doctor or therapist. Things were pretty great up until a couple weeks ago. Before we moved in together we fought a bit but it was usually just that initial snap and then he would cool off after an hour or so. Then about two weeks ago I noticed he was starting to get more irritable and would snap at the littlest things. There were times when I didn't even know what I did. He has substance abuse issues. He drinks and smokes marijuana regularly. He occasionally does coke, but I have made it known that I do not want him doing that. We have argued about that before too. The first month living together he tried to stop smoking and after about 5 days he was a mess. Depressed. Shut down. Anxious. Crying. I don't really have a problem with the smoking except that he is so dependent on it and cannot quit long enough to pass a drug test. I drink too so I don't really mind that either, unless it becomes an every night thing.

&amp;#x200B;

So the other night we were talking and I was trying to arrange for his brother to come and visit and he ended up getting really anxious and flipping out. He deleted me on Facebook, which I have told him multiple times, it really really gets to me. When I found this out, I decided to pack a bag and go to my female friend's house. I ended up drinking too much and came home around 4am, drunk. He was pissed because I came home drunk. He assumed that I slept with someone else. I went to work and came home and went straight to bed. He didn't say anything to me. A couple hours passed and I got hungry so I went to get some leftovers out of the kitchen. He was there and he called me a disgusting bitch. I went back to the room and about a half hour later, he came in with a plate and said that he wasn't over what happened but he knew I hadn't eaten so he made me food. Then he left and went back to drinking and listening to music. Another 30 minutes passed and he came into the room sobbing. He crawled into bed and put his arms around me and repeated over and over again that he was sorry. We both were crying together for about ten minutes. Then he got up and left again. He came in a little bit later and got on top of me, and was being playful and then all of a sudden he put his hands around my neck and started choking me. He said he would fucking kill me if I ever did this to him again. If I ever left him again. I was flailing around and he got off of me. He went into the other room. I was coughing and wheezing, trying to catch my breath. He came into the room and said that the lady that lives below us called the cops and that I better be quiet. He had a knife. He told me to shut off my phone. He said that if the cops were already here and were going to arrest him, he might as well do something worth getting arrested for. He threatened to kill me and himself multiple times, in different ways. Said he would chop me into pieces and throw my body into a river somewhere. I ended up slightly de escalating the situation. Enough so that I wasn't in the room with him and the knife with no way to escape. I went and looked out the window and there were no cops outside. I grabbed a knife for protection. He was sitting on the couch with the knife saying that he ""has to do it"". That it is either he kills himself or he kills me. Eventually he got up and put the knife away. I grabbed a couple knives and put them by my bedside table. I know I should have called the cops, but I didn't want to deal with it. I was exhausted and sad and I did not want to deal with it. We ended up going to bed. He was holding me. We slept and woke up around 3am and had sex. This was voluntary on my part, so he definitely didn't force me into that. We talked a little about some things. He was pretty much sobered up by this point. We started getting ready for work and I told him that he needed to get help if this was going to work. He said he didn't want to. I said that if we break up it isnt going to be pretty. I will get a restraining order because I have no idea what he would do. Our conversation got cut short because we both had to go to work so we really didn't reach a consensus. I love him and I know that I am naive and probably stupid for still loving him. I want him to get help. Mental help. I get off at 6pm tonight so I guess we will see what happens. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel so tired, exhausted, and done. I don't want to deal with this. I'm in nursing school and working full time. I barely have any time for myself, let alone time to deal with the cops and possibly moving out/back in with my parents. Not to mention the financial aspect. He gives me his entire paycheck, but its only enough to cover his portion of rent and utilities. We have a vacation to Vegas coming up in a few weeks. The tickets are non-refundable and cannot be modified. It is too soon for me to cancel the reservations. I will lose around $1500 if we don't go. I just feel like I can't deal with this. I needed to get it out to someone. I'm afraid to tell anyone I know personally because I am afraid they will report it and like I said, I don't feel like I can handle all that right now. I feel like I want to go to sleep and not wake up for awhile, but life must go I on. I have to keep going to work and class and working on homework and studying like my whole life isn't falling apart around me. I don't want to do it anymore. It sounds so stupid to say that I feel like I want to die, because when he was threatening my life I was terrified and it's not what I wanted. Maybe I just didn't want that to be how I died. Idk. My thoughts are all jumbled. Maybe I just need to hear a kind word or know that somebody else knows how I feel. I'm sorry for rambling.",bleufeels1,2019-02-15 07:52:00,7,1301,22.19,37.91,70.39,3.9,12.51,11.15,93.85,62.49,22.6,16.45,9.07,1.54,0,5.69,0.15,6.07,4.3,13.53,9.38,6.3,8.84,2.38,21.52,3.23,1.61,1,0.54,2.31,4.23,1,3.23,0.85,1.23,0.85,11.3,0.23,0.08,0.15,5.84,11.84,1.92,1.08,2.23,3,0.77,4.23,2.54,0.23,1.38,0.85,3.38,0.77,1.31,0.15,1.08,7.99,2.69,1.15,2.77,1.46,0.54,9.61,8.76,1.54,16.91,3.38,7.76,5.76,1.31,0.92,1.61,0.69,0,0.54,0.46,0.23,0.08,0.08,0.08,0.08,13.37,8.15,1.77,0,0.46,0,0,0.08,0.15,1.84,0.31,0.61
aqysmx,He beat me in front of my boys,"Finally last night in a drunk stuppor her slapped me and then held me down and punched me. After the eight time, I stopped counting. I screamed at my boys to run and get my bag. They did and as soon as he let me go we were out of the house and in my car. I drove off not knowing where to go. Couldnt go to my moms because my brother was there and if he saw me all hell would break lose. I went to his aunts house and rang the doorbell, but it was 11:40 pm so there waa no answer. I mean I dont blame them. My mom called and said my brother was gone. I sped to her house and made it there. He got there before I did, bit my mother heald up and old heavy wrench and said if he came near me she would unleash all hell on him. We made it inside and I stayed strong and didnt let my kids see me cry. I have nothing, I dont make enough to replace all of my childrens things. We ran out with the clothes on our back. 

We are all broken. I knew this was coming but I stayed. I thoight it would never escalate, but I was wrong. I didnt call the cops, but I need to press charges. Im so so afraid of what will happen. The court system, my failure to protect my kids. Im a terrible mother. One thing I do know is I will not go back. I will not answer his calls. I will have to fight for custody of my youngest and Im so afraid of him getting custody. I have never been so broken like I am now.

I overcame grief, of my first husband. I am a survivor, I will survive this. I will rise and build myself up, I have too. How will I ever do that?

Im so lost, but I will need to find myself and fix the boys and me.",kiketetebob,2019-02-15 09:15:30,16,351,5.99,12.14,96.52,1,11.32,9.12,93.73,64.39,25.36,22.51,17.09,1.42,0,3.42,0.57,2.85,2.85,10.83,11.68,5.98,9.97,3.42,23.08,3.99,1.71,0.85,1.42,1.42,4.27,0.28,3.99,0.57,1.14,1.42,11.4,2.28,0,2.28,4.27,10.83,1.99,1.42,2.28,0.57,2.28,3.42,2.28,0.57,1.14,0.57,0.57,0.28,0,0,0.28,7.98,2.28,2.28,2.28,0.85,1.42,8.83,9.12,3.13,15.1,4.56,6.27,5.41,0.28,0.28,1.14,0,0.57,0.28,0.57,0.57,0,0,0,0,11.97,8.26,3.13,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0

aqzn52,I don’t know if I’m being abused or not... looking for help here,"Hi. After another fight with my boyfriend last night I’ve turned here because I’m confused and don’t know what’s going on.. 

I’m going to try and tell this story from both sides that way it’s not biased.. 

Me (23F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been bestfriends for about a year and just recently started dating in September. We have lived together since October. 

Every relationship I have been in I have never really fought with my partner but I do try and realize when I make mistakes. 

Anyways, our relationship is great and fine I always think until we start fighting.. I’ve been noticing a lot when we fight that he kind of blames everything on me.. when a fight is starting he will kind of talk down to me, he will sit at the table and act really “innocent” I guess and it makes me feel crazy especially if I’m really upset.. he will always say things like “I didn’t ask for this fight” and other things. 

He says that I don’t remember things right when we fight and that makes me feel crazy

An example I guess would be the fight we had lastnight.. it was a great day we were making dinner together and everything. We were just sitting at the table having a few glasses of wine and we were trying to figure out when we wanted to do for the rest of the evening. I asked if he still wanted to be intimate later and he was jokingly like “ahhh planned sex” and I told him I didn’t mean it like that and he said “well I don’t have to be the one to always initiate it” and I was like woah.. and told him I didn’t think he was the only one.. then the night kind of turned. We were quiet for a while and at one point he asked why I was throwing a fit and I said that my feelings had been hurt and he said “I’m sorry” and I explained that when he said that my mind made me think that i wasn’t pleasing him or doing what he wanted when we were intimate. He then said “I said I was sorry” I guess it just felt like an empty apology and would’ve liked some consoling or something. Anyways he said he was going to bed and I heard him mumble on his way into the bedroom. 

We got in bed and he was like “you can’t not pick a fight with me even on Valentines Day” and I said that I wasn’t doing that my feelings were just hurt.  He then reiterated that he said sorry and I said that I guess I wanted more than that and he went on to say how he can never doing anything right and how he cant even talk to me when I’m mad and how I blow everything out of proportion.. I then started to feel like the blame was being put on me so I just got up and slept on the futon and heard him say “a perfect way to end the night” and that was the end of it.. 

I guess I just don’t know what’s going on... in a lot of ways I feel like I’m being gaslighted or manipulated into thinking I’m always doing something wrong, but he says that he feels like he’s always doing something wrong.. I just don’t know....",anonymous_girl246810,2019-02-15 10:34:46,1,585,6.3,56.8,81.26,1.51,21.67,10.94,96.41,64.79,24.96,18.12,10.43,2.22,0.17,5.3,0,6.84,4.27,10.43,12.65,6.15,10.26,3.08,26.15,3.59,2.39,2.56,0.51,1.37,5.81,1.37,4.44,0.34,2.22,1.03,16.92,0,0.85,0,5.64,16.92,3.76,2.39,1.71,4.44,2.22,4.1,4.96,0.17,3.08,1.71,0.85,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.34,7.18,4.27,1.03,0.85,0.85,0.34,10.6,12.31,1.88,15.04,1.37,5.98,7.69,0,0.17,0.68,0,0,0,0.85,0,0.17,0,0.34,0.51,16.24,7.52,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,2.74,4.79,0.68,0
ar02w6,I need clarification,"Please don’t tell me to leave him. I know about all that already. I know what I should do, but it’s hard to actually do it. Anyways, my boyfriend (21m) and I (18f) usually do very well. He makes me happier than anyone. But he makes me sadder than anyone too. He can’t control his temper. When he gets mad it’s over little things. We’ve been together for 2 years as of yesterday. Our relationship is like a constantly bumpy road. When it’s good it’s great. But when it’s bad it’s f**king terrible. He calls me names when he gets mad (b***, cu**, stupif b**) . Recently he will throw his hands up at me to make me flinch. But last night on it anniversary and Valentine’s Day we got into an argument over something stupid. He elbowed me in the face when we were in the car because I got “an attitude”. When we got out of the car I ran in the house and I was super upset and started packing my things. He threw my things everywhere to keep me from leaving. He broke my key fob off my key and threw it into the bushes. He pushed me down and I fell. He hit the bed next to me but hit me in the face instead. He says he didn’t mean to and that he meant to hit the bed. I tried to kick him away from me when he was doing this but he hit my leg. I have bruises. I don’t know what to do. When he isn’t mad everything is perfect. He’s a good nice person with lots of love. But when he’s mad he’s someone completely different. I don’t want to leave him. I love him very much. But things are escalating. I just want to help him control his anger. This isn’t the first time we’ve gotten into a fight like this.

ar1qop,My girlfriend is abusive and I fought back,"Valentines Day...

&amp;#x200B;

We went out for a great meal, had a great time that was loving throughout. She suggested we eat some aphrodisiac chocolates...which we did on the way home.

She has a bad temper that I have learned to just accept, because when we are good, we are fucking amazing.

So, she went to hug me and banged her temple on my head. She was hurt but i didnt realise because she seemed ok and it didnt hurt me. She got mad because i didnt hug her and make her feel better. As she wasnt communicating with me, I shifted off to bed. I was a upset so I threw my clothing down and was going to bed. She started mouthing off at me, and because I was full of food and we had both had a couple of glasses of wine, I childishly stuck my middle fingers up at her.

She then grabbed a heavy pint glass and raised it as if she was going to hit me. I grabbed it from her hand and took it to the other side of the room. I put it down on a table, but I was a bit scared because she really looked like she was going to smash it over my head. This thing had a big base, and I'm not sure now what her intention was.

As I put the glass down, I turned back to her and my own laptop was flying towards me. I caught it, and put it down.

Something came over me, I felt like I was being attacked, and she had a table in front of her with several glasses, cups, and a knife, in front of her. I thought any one of those things could be coming next.

I was scared, seriously. So I ran towards her, and pushed her on to the sofa. I did it with some force and now she has a huge bruise on her arm from where I grabbed her arm. It is massive. It looks like I took a run up and punched her in the arm! I'm so confused about my rights to self defence, because in the ensuing argument, she kept saying that I hurt her, but avoided talking about the fact that she threatened me with a blunt object and then threw a computer at me.

I don't even know if I am the abuser or the abused in this situation, but its being made out like I walked in and started hitting her.

I don't know what to do, I love her, but this shit is way too fucked up.

There are other incidents i wont go into but I've been stuck in this abuse for about a year. We are currently on ""good"" terms because hes pretending like nothing's happening while I'm figuring out what I want to do. My problem is, pardon the cliche, i don't recognize myself anymore.  

Ive been so focused on fixing things with my husband that i noticed this slow progression. I've become more hateful, bitter and self conscious. I feel like I have to be this perfect person because otherwise no one is going to believe I went through this. I project my issues everywhere trying to get attention that i need from a counselor or just act robotic pretending nothing's wrong. Im probably overthinking that too rn honestly. Now i just wait day by day trying to gain courage to take action while getting depressed from being so pathetic.  

Now im seeking therapy but i have 0 clue on how to approach this... I want to become my better self again so i can advocate for myself for what happens next.

ar61u7,Champion's Song - ER on Friday Night at 7.5 Months Pregnant,"YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO BE BEATEN.  EVER.

My birthday is 1/20/18. The first day he beat me.  Pulled me by my scalp off his bed.

The feeling of shatter persisted.  Trust cracked.  Shocked by the conflict of loving he who assaults.

I am going to raise this baby with sprite.  I am going to FORGET what my angry partner and mother look like, sound like, and cut.  

I am going to GROW.  I will not fan the flames of horror movie memories.  My meals will be as regular as I exercise and, post-baby, go to steam rooms.

So what I am fighting a wall of water.  Of having no protector.  Of being pulled screaming into a car knowing if he didn't let me out he could murder me.

So what I am more alone than Daniel because at least he had God.  So what I am a pregnant woman lost in the forest with wolves around my campfire.  I have a good bank account.

So what I have a father with three residences, eight additional rental properties, five cars, and a six figure day job, who never gave me more than $20 in my life.  Due to his neglect, I am recession proof.

So what the only help my father, my protector, gave me was telling me to ""get a shotgun"" for self-defense.  My new house is going to be balling.

So what I couldn't move away, because the only other place I could go was near my mother.  Who put me under a fire hose and calls me Satan's child.  I am dumping her and my partner.

So what I can't stop replaying today's assault.  He will kill me.  So what my therapist has inadequate trauma training, imho.  The visual memory will fade even if I cling to it, so there. 

So what my head and body and stomach and lungs hurt.  So what if all the times he hit my head, all the permanent bumps, are dancing in unison. The baby tylenol at the hospital will help great.

So what I am dead inside a little.  I joined a singing group and sing loud like my life (soul) depends on it.

So what someone stole my puppy.  So what I told all of facebook he was my best friend like a loser.  That can't stop me.

You call this a storm?

I have my limbs.  He didn't choke me well enough.  Baby kicks proud when I leave him.  

So what I feel him still spitting in my face with mucous, when I was lowdown when I had an abortion scheduled.  He beat me well enough to send me to the ER so I saw baby kick - hoorah.

I am, like always, gritting my teeth.  Spitting blood onto every hardship like it's nothing.  You won't stop me.  Baby is a little rainbow and I am PROUD.

So what I am texting him in the ER.  #real.  So what he is saying he was trying to protect me by dragging me screaming into his car, which was smoking, when my own car was close enough.  I won.  When I drove by him, I mashed that gas. 

So what I believe it is mainly my fault.  So what my mom GROOMED me perfectly, making me out to be a monster.  So what he is trying to cast a spell that him trying to abduct me was to protect me from my wicked self and I was ""doing everything [he] could"" to stop him from his noble assault.

So what I can't lubricate during sex any more.  I am going to a naturopath that will solve everything.  So fucking what my HPV returned twice.  I take my turmeric.

So what I keep checking my phone to see if he has texted back.  Whoop de do.  He is wrong, I do have a backbone and I stand up for myself in text.  Still not going down to his level, and it has been a year.

So what I hate myself.  Baby doesn't know that.  Regular nutrition and trauma specialist are my long-term con to steal my joy back.  So what it's a long con.

You call this a storm?  Baby is FINE.  I sped up when I saw him and drove straight to the ER.  So what my dreams are shot because he does this still.  So what it scalds my lungs so I can't breathe.  That is, simply, what ice water is for.

ar675d,Looking to make a change,"Soooooo

This is a first for me. I’m never even on reddit but my partner raves about it so I’m trying something new. 

We got in a fight yesterday...our communication is actually pretty decent but we both have some complex trauma and things get intense when we both get triggered in conversation. 

She comes from an abusive household and I come from a distant one.

My trauma has manifested in ways that result in me being physically aggressive.

I used to drink a lot when I was in high school. It always lead to me being physically abusive to those around me. My friends and my family. 

I have since got a handle on my drinking and I actually don’t like drinking at all. I don’t consider myself “sober” because I will enjoy a glass of wine here or there. I have learned that 1-2 is my limit.

With that being said. Life hasn’t spared me any. I’ve been going through a lot of shit and I don’t want to use my trauma as my “reasoning” for exploding on my partner.

I’m fully aware that I have more work to do to avoid getting to that point.

It’s really hard because, last night when we were talking. We were talking about the shifts we have been going through and I was sharing that I have been having a hard time during our kink exploration because being in dom headspace doesn’t feel safe for me (because of my abisive history) 

I ended up getting frustrated with her because she kept saying how she heard me and thanked me for sharing that but at the same time telling me “why would you do those things if you didn’t want to?” 

It made me feel  like she wasn’t listening to me and that is one of my triggers. I started to talk a lot with my hands and raise my voice and that was triggering for her as well. 

She jumped up and started screaming about how it’s bullshit that “I’m doing this again” — meaning that I make her feel safe and then take it away 

That really frustrated me because I didn’t feel like I was “doing anything” at this point we were just talking and she was triggered by the conversation topic. 

Things took a turn because she ended up in a state of hysteria. Crying and screaming about how she can’t do this anymore and I was confused as to how things even got to that level of intensity. Which is always our issue.

We will be in the middle of a conversation and it’s usually after I mention that I feel not listened to but sometimes out of no where she will freak out about how “this is too much to handle and that it’s not fair” 

I get really frustrated when she freaks out like this and starts acting like things are bigger than they are and it’s in these moments that I reach out for her to just and get her to look me in the eye or sit down and breathe with me.

Yesterday was different though because we were talking and she was telling me how I “wasn’t being chill” when I feel that I was and I get very irritated when people tell me what I am thinking or doing. And I grabbed her and said “I will show you what’s not chill, you wanna see me not be chill?” And I wasn’t trying to hurt her but I was definitely trying to “contain” her and “get control” which is not healthy and I acknowledged that with myself and with her the next morning.

She is spending the evening at her friends house.

I don’t know if I’m explaining any of this properly.

It’s so much to type and I am not the best with words

I think I am reaching out to find out from other folks who have experienced something like this. Either as the abuser or the victim and what to do.

My partner says she’s happy that therapy is an option but she hasn’t said much else since the incident

I called a hotline and they said that going to therapy together isn’t a good idea because I have more work to do myself before I can hold space for couples therapy. 

So I’m not sure what to do.

I want to be better for her.
We live together
We have a baby.
There’s a lot of ties and it’s hard to “do my own thing” and focus on my self when we have to do so many things together

Before all of this happened I did ask her to hold space for me as I dive deeper into my healing because I had acknowledged my toxic masculinity and abusive tendencies before all of this happened I am just ready to actively do something about it now.",Soulflower1994,2019-02-15 22:31:09,0,824,11.7,28.42,82.37,22.02,22.27,14.56,95.15,66.38,24.51,16.63,10.92,1.82,0.49,3.16,0.24,7.89,3.64,14.44,12.5,6.07,9.83,2.79,22.33,4.13,3.03,2.67,0.61,2.31,5.34,2.55,2.79,0.36,1.21,0.24,10.92,0.36,0.61,3.16,0.12,15.05,2.55,4,0.85,3.03,0.97,4.73,3.64,0.61,1.46,1.46,2.06,0.49,1.09,0,0.49,7.89,3.64,1.21,1.21,1.94,0.36,5.95,12.5,1.09,12.38,1.21,6.07,5.1,0.61,0.73,0.36,0.12,0,0,0.97,0.49,0.24,0,0.12,0,11.89,4.49,0.24,0,0,0.24,0,0.12,2.67,3.88,0.24,0
ar6hic,"Wondering if this is normal for this ""stage"" of the process","I posted in Alanon a little while back with the full story, but here's the abridged.

&amp;#x200B;

I was married to my wife for a little over a year, we were in a 2-year relationship. We were deeply in love and I was happy to do anything with her. We were crazy about each other. Then the problems started. Always accompanied with drinking, she would go completely crazy, making animal noises and threatening me, punching and kicking. The next day we talked about it and she revealed her incredibly traumatic past. I asked her to get help and she said she would. Over and over this happened, with her weening away from the help she promised to get. ""Good"" days with drinking ended in an argument where she would belittle me, yell at me, or freak out over small things like sweeping the floor, dirty dishes, or not leaving a light on. We switched apartments because our two roommates unfortunately got really heavy into the drug scene in town and we wanted a place by ourselves. One of those roommates she punched in the face while drunk which led to him leaving. 

The new apartment faired no better. There was always an excuse for the behavior, bad neighbors (we actually had terrible neighbors who would torture and goad my wife into confrontations). Often times I would come home and find her passed out on the floor in her own vomit. The physical abuse had stopped, but the drinking and verbal/emotional abuse had gotten worse. She began gaslighting me, telling me I didn't remember things correctly, etc.

We had to switch apartments again because we were kicked out, but the landlord knew she had a problem and marked it as us leaving rather than a proper eviction. The final apartment everything seemed fine. She had promised to quit drinking completely, attend AA, leaving her job working at a bar, and start doing more. But she didnt. I would come home and she would be so stoned it was no fun to be around her. She would sometimes tell me that it was my fault that we didn't do anything, but at that point I was so paranoid to pick anything affordable or ""small"" because there would be alcohol in the vacinity and I didn't trust her not going near the stuff. I found out later that she was having a beer or two on the side and telling people in town not to tell me if they saw me.

It ended on new years eve when she got drunk and told me to pack my things when I went to pick her up from work. I told her I would talk to her in the morning when she was sober, and if it's what she really wanted that I would do it tomorrow. She called me after she got out of work screaming at the top of her lungs that all my stuff would be outside. When I got there to pick up my stuff she assaulted me, broke my glasses, punched me multiple times and bit me so hard I still have a mark months later.

I told her I was getting a divorce because I couldn't trust that while she was promising to get better that she wouldn't do it again and cause more damage that I couldnt be financially accountable for. I told her that I loved her, that I would support her, and that I was moving back east to start my career. I told her that when she was done with rehab, with whatever she needed to do to fight these demons, that I would be waiting for her. It was hard because I couldnt talk to her most times, telling her that she needed to focus on getting better and talk to me when she was done. She said she would do anything.

A week after that she was back in the bars. A week after that she started hooking up with a bartender in that bar. She told me that she no longer loved me, that she regretted marrying me and a whole host of other terrible things. I don't believe them because she's drinking all the time, and that I still love her and would be here when she decided to get better. She told me the same thing in person (while shitfaced at 11am on a sunday), told me again in text after I hung up on her demanding the paperwork for the divorce (she refused to pay for any of it because I ""had offered""). She posted a picture of the new guy with my dog (who I had given her so she at least had someone to take care of) where everyone could see it online. Someone stopped me on the street concerned because she posted really racey pictures of herself online where everyone could see too. She had blocked me on social media at this point, except for one form which she had originally posted the material, so I'm still convinced that she wanted me to see it.

The most recent interaction was on Valentines day. She called once in the afternoon and left a silent voicemail. I figured she was playing at just getting my attention. Then she called again at 11pm, and when I picked up she was sarcastic and asking about the paperwork. I told her that she would get it when it was ready (which I've said a million times). She said in a sarcastic tone that that was all she wanted to h- I hung up on her. A half hour later I got a six page text message about how I wasn't man enough to handle her, about how I wasn't someone she should ever have been sad about, that everyone hates me because she told them the truth, and that I needed to get the paperwork done so I would get out of ""her town"".

I was mad. Then I just responded that at a certain point she would realize how much damage she was doing to herself. That I would always love her, no matter what she would do, and that when she thought of me with clarity that I hoped she would message me and say something that she actually meant.

She avoided the whole message, told me that I was ugly, told me that I had no style and then basically repeated all the insults shes been using since I left.

What I wanted to ask, about this being normal, is that I'm still sitting here wondering if there's something I could say or do to get her to understand that I would wait for her, that if she just gave finding help a chance she could be okay. I feel in my heart that there's not, and I know I'll break down on the plane back east. But I miss her. I miss the little scared girl in there who was never really shown love in her early years, and is always so angry at everything. The only thing she truly loved was me, and she reminded me all the time. I was her best relationship she would say over and over and over again, no matter what the situation (post incident or just a normal day).

Some days I feel like I may have made the wrong choice, that by leaving I cast her into oblivion. I know it's wrong to think that because no one deserves being treated that way, but I'm so scared that the person I love is truly gone. We wanted kids, a family, property. We were planning for the future. I asked her to get help and she pissed it all away. I'm pretty confused about everything right now, and if anyone can help me sort out some of these thoughts that'd be great.",yourlifeisastory,2019-02-15 23:14:49,2,1326,19.87,67.45,29.23,12.71,20.4,13.5,94.87,63.57,25.41,17.5,8.22,1.13,0,7.92,0.23,7.92,5.51,11.99,9.95,5.88,7.32,1.73,20.21,4.45,1.96,2.04,0.75,1.51,6.18,2.56,3.54,0.45,1.36,0.38,16.59,0.45,0.45,7.99,0.23,13.8,1.89,1.73,4,2.87,2.04,3.02,1.89,0.6,0.9,0.38,2.26,0.38,0.38,0,0.98,8.3,3.39,0.83,2.11,1.96,0.98,9.35,6.86,0.83,16.52,1.21,8.22,7.24,0.75,1.21,0.98,0.3,0.08,0,0.3,0.23,0,0.08,0,0,12.52,4.83,3.92,0,0.15,0,0,0.15,0.75,1.58,0.9,0.23
ar6rcu,Things I thought I was passed are leaking out my eyes,"For five years I dated/lived with a man who while maintaining and off and on drug habit would also be abusive. As someone struggling with my own mental illness I would say hate the addict not the man. Until the man was found cheating , would tell me if people knew the real me they would hate me. I would wake up early to drive him to work ( he couldn't drive) and literally would be called some variation of stupid c*** for months in end . I made excuses for the time he strangled me and the time he punched me in the face and the time he threw me to the ground in public. As a result my friends never realized the extent of the hell I was living.

The problem is this  :I still feel grief and the first six months since I finally got a restraining order were mostly focused on survival. I'm in a bit of a more stable place  however it's  now that little comments mess me up. I settle for people who treat me less than ideally because I've heard so many times it's what I deserve.

I’m strangely at peace. I am just done with being treated like shit. I’ve been done for a while but I guess I needed to see one more time what he is capable of. 

I’m also afraid. Afraid he will show up. Afraid he will call the cops and try to come into my home. He has a way with cops and with making them believe I am the perpetrator when I am the victim. They believe his lies every time. 

I’m going to go back to sleep for a while then wake up and study. When I feel like it I’ll get his shit together and drop it at his brothers.

ardgfw,How to let go?,"So im going to be honest here. Although I am a victim of domestic violence, that does not make me a saint. 

4 years ago i moved to a new state and flourished. I had an amazing job, stable relationship with my family, i smiled, i laughed, i talked to people with confidence, woke up happy. 
Then i met a guy. We'll call him George. George finnessed me. Made me feel beautiful, took me out, we had fun. He was new and interesting. I fell hard and fast. So hard and fast that i ignored all the red flags because it was an exciting and passionate relationship. I was having fun. My first adult relationship. I was 25, he was 37. But we clicked. Very soon after i figured out that he was an alcoholic. He changed when he drank. He was rude, cocky, and pushy but almost in a fun loving way. I drank to keep our moods the same. I could not handle drunk him while i was sober. So i drank all the time and eventually my relationship with my mother fell apart.
Then we started arguing alot. We always made up and he always said sorry. I believed him. He loves me.
Then the violence started. But i loved him. I wanted him to get better but by that time i had resented him so much that even if he could fix what he had done, it would never be the same. 
He and i were homeless. He was all i had. I didn't know what to do so we stayed together. It didn't get any better. I eventually started fighting back. I had to prove something. Idk what. It was toxic and a part of me liked it. 
Then he almost killed me. He went to jail and continued talking to one another. He had me fully convinced that he loved me, he was the only one who loved me, and no matter what we went thru or would go thru, i was his forever. He was in love with me. I missed the good him. He got out of jail and we met up, i got pregnant. No more violence, no more drinking. We wanted to be good parents. Then baby was born and he went back to drinking. 
One day while he was at work, i packed up most of my stuff and the baby and we left. 
I never went back. That was in august 2018. 
I still talk to him and let him see his daughter. Hes a dumb guy but he cares about her and he's a great dad.
We started sleeping together again. He has continued drinking but he is not violent. 

I was codependent on him. I finally broke free and now he has me back. I dont love him. I dont like him. Seeing him hurts me, sex is lackluster. It makes me feel guilty because i should be stronger than this. I feel guilty because a lot of people helped me get away from him. 
I dont want to be his prisoner anymore. I dont want to fall for the head games. But im so afraid of letting him go. That will be that. He will move on and I am fucking broken. I am a strong girl and I dont play the victim but what he did affected me. I lost confidence, friends, the ability to be alone, thrived on chaos because I was always hurt, I was aliented and almost killed. It isn't fair that he gets off so easy, but im too tired to keep it up. It's exhausting. Agonizing over losing him would feel better than being in this ""relationship"". 

Im going to tell him tomorrow that I cannot sleep with him anymore. I want my life back. I want to be normal again.

During that relationship she was an addict, successfully completed the 12 steps, yet remained in the relationship until she was finally able to get away. She has been through a lot. 

I really fell for this girl and have feelings for her. But it seems that she may be keeping me at arms length or in the ""friend zone.""

arl0kw,How long will healing take?,"The relationship with the man I lived with ended when I ended up in the hospital with a brain injury in late December. The physical and sexual violence had been escalating for months before that incident. I have no self esteem. I am lonely. I don’t eat. I drink a small amount of soup every day to survive. I now weigh 105 pounds. I have no energy for exercise other than light walking. I have been going to a therapist, psychiatrist, physical therapist, domestic violence support groups. I don’t have a normal life in any sense. I don’t have any joy. I spend every bit of energy just surviving and healing. I am so tired. I wonder if I will ever heal physically or emotionally. It is now late February and I’m not functioning. I’m not eating, not exercising, no longer working, I don’t leave my home unless I have an appointment. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. We lived in my home and I still live here alone. I spend a lot of time cleaning the floors and walls trying to clean every surface he may have touched. I am really worried.

arl53m,Nightmares and every day triggers?,"I’ve been out of  a 2 years relationship since December 10th when he hit me for the last time, broke in, admitted to stalking me, and stole from me. On my 21st birthday in September I experienced the worse out of all the times he hurt me. He was stand offish at the bars for my birthday but as soon as we got home, it was a living nightmare. My whole face was busted, my jaw was featured, four finger hand marks on my next, eyes swollen shut. He also had stripped me and sent naked pictures of me to a lot of people. I think he tried to have sex with me but I do not remember, there are parts of the night I don’t remember because I was very very drunk because it was my 21st and also because I have put those memories away. The last thing I remember is laying on the ground and him squating over me and punching me over and over so hard that I had peed my pants. We had broken up in October, but he told me he needed me in his life and he couldn’t do it without me so he wanted me to be his friend. I did not want this, we had talked on and off because I was scared not to...during those months he became a lot more crazier. He’d show up to my house if I didn’t text back,He would get on his knees and beg me to be his gf, sent me pics of him self harming himself because “it feels better than not having you”, told my mom that if I wasn’t going to be with him that he’d kill me then himself. At this point I already had a protective order but was afraid to call the cops because his family are all politically higher up in my city and they would beg me not to.

It’s been 10 weeks. I go to therapy once a week, have been diagnosed with an anxiety, depression, and PTSD since the night he broke in (the night I called the cops) since that night I haven’t slept more than four hours a night, I toss and turn. I always scan a restaurant or bar or store before I continue because I’m scared that I will see him. But the reason for this post is that lately I have these awful dreams of him hurting me again. Sometimes it’s reliving the times it actually happened and sometimes it’s a new situation in a new place. I’m not sure if there’s anything I can do to help this but if anyone has tips I’m all ears.

I also was wondering if anyone else is triggered by small daily things that remind them of their abuser?  My ex listened to EDM and smoked dabs. Every time I hear that music or a song he mixed a lot or taste or smell dabs I immediately feel uneasy. 

Days like today (waking up from a nightmare with him in it) makes it feel like it’s never going to get better. My family isn’t supportive (dad and sister) because they don’t understand why I didn’t leave after the first time.",prettylilthrowaway4,2019-02-17 06:46:02,3,545,23.22,20.96,92.26,2.69,23.7,11.01,94.68,62.2,23.3,17.61,11.01,0.55,0.18,5.14,0.73,5.69,5.14,13.03,10.64,3.49,8.99,2.94,19.08,5.5,2.75,0.37,1.1,2.02,4.22,0.73,3.3,0.92,0.37,0.92,11.01,0.92,0.37,0.55,5.32,15.23,2.57,2.94,2.02,3.49,1.47,5.87,3.85,0.92,0.92,1.47,3.85,1.65,0.92,0.37,1.1,6.42,1.83,0.73,2.94,1.1,0.37,7.89,8.62,0.92,17.25,1.47,6.42,9.17,0.18,1.65,0.73,0.18,0,0.18,0.37,0,0.18,0,0,0,12.84,4.4,3.12,0,0,0.37,0,0,0.37,3.49,1.1,0
armd7m,Has anyone ever warned an abusive ex’s new significant other?,"My abuser started out very slowly grooming me within the first few weeks (I didn’t know what love bombing and gaslighting was then) and by the time it got really bad he already had me so emotionally confused and we were married. I tried to stick it out for the kids which I wish I hadn’t done.  He eventually was arrested for hurting me and the 7 year marriage of hell ended. 

I found out he has a new girlfriend of just a few weeks. She has small children as do my ex and I. They both have brought one another around the kids already. I’m sick with worry that the kids will see scary things.  She’s going through a divorce and I worry that he will take advantage of that emotional time and groom her too. He has never lived on his own. He’s almost 40 and has always lived with his parents, except for when he moved in to my house with me...so I worry he will try to move in with her and it’ll be even more traumatic for the kids. 

I realize it sounds crazy but I have this urge to just warn her that he’s abusive. Part of me thinks “I wish someone would’ve told me!” While the other part thinks “I would think someone was psycho if they did that!”. 

How do I get rid of this urge? Should I try to warn her? I’m so lost and feeling hopeless. I hate feeling this way. I just want it out of my mind.

(I tried to post on r/relationships, but they removed it and suggested I post here).","After my post was removed, I am now scared that maybe I am downplaying this situation. I am copy/pasting original, because I am now crying after my post was removed from other sub:

Prescript: I may not give the most graphic details because if my friend sees this (hoping she may), I don't want her to think I posted all of her private business on the internet. I would welcome dm's if you want to know very private details, as long as it doesn't get out of control.

Sorry for formatting, on mobile, will clean up Monday and add tl:dr

Characters: me= me/I
Best friend= V
Her guy= Ray
My fiance= Jordan



Backstory: V has been my best friend for about four years. 

Two years ago she got into a relationship with Ray. Our group of friends saw a lot of red flags with Ray (alcoholic, some drugs, posessive, gaslighter, always plays pity/victim, controlling), but she didn't want to hear it because she really liked the guy. He seemed likable to us sometimes, but he definately had some issues he needed to sort out. I certainly saw past his charm, so he was never fond of me. We mentioned our concerns, but she is grown and makes her own choices. They moved in together.

About three months ago, something bad happened. The four of us went to a comedy show. Ray showed up drunk and was being a dick to the comedian. That embarrassed V. After the show we went to get drinks and Ray tagged along after being told by V that she did not want to be around him. He kept harassing her at the bar, poking and prodding and eventually she got tired of it and wanted to go home. Jordan and I decided to walk her home and Ray realized we were down the street and trailed along. They made it home safely, drunk, but safe.

About 8 am, I get a call from V's sister that V is in jail on domestic violence charges. Please try to understand that this is one of the most passive people alive. She would cry before she would ever hurt someone. You can't even tell a dark joke without her hurting from the possibility that dark humor stems from dark people in the world. 

Apparently, after we dropped them off, they started arguing, he was holding her down, she bit his nose and called the cops. The cops arrive, Ray hides because he thinks he has a warrant. V is in tears. The cops find Ray. No warrant. The cops see bite mark on nose, nothing on V. They ask Ray if he wants to press charges, he says no, but the state is required to pick up a d.v., and because he has a mark on him, V goes to jail. 

After the weekend in jail, both V and Ray fight to get the restraining order removed so that she can go back into her home. They end up rekindling. He feels guilty, she is scared because she has NEVER encountered any kind of trouble from the law.

Last week, she made a decision out of fear (she did bite him, but if she said self defense, she was scared to get him in trouble). She took a plea to probation with d.v. classes and a fine. Upon completion of all (about 14 months), her sentence will be deferred and exponged, and it will be as if she never had a charge on her record. She meets her probation people in two weeks. She has a long road and she was trying to figure things out with Ray (they still live together). 

Now to last night: about 1:30p-5:45p Ray is over playing guitar and drinking beers with us. He goes home because V gets off work at 6p and their dog needs fed. Jordan and I call up V and ask if her and Ray want to join us for dinner at 6:10p. She said yes. At about 6:20p V shows up at the restraunt alone. She said Ray was drunk, passed out when she got home. That's normal, so we didn't think about it, and the three of us made plans for and evening of drinking at the local bar. 

After we have dinner and know our plans, we (me and Jordan) get in V's car with her and ride to her house so she can park it and we can walk to the bar. Well Ray woke up and demanded that V is ""not allowed"" to go anywhere until they have a talk. V did not want to talk and told him no (he was very drunk and being rude). 

V ends up telling him that he can join us at the bar and he can talk to her as they walk.

He got very upset about this. He belittled her and us the entire way to the bar. We get settled in at the bar and he seems to cheer up some and even seemed to enjoy himself. 

We were at the bar for about an hour when Ray got super drunk and decided that he was just going to be a complete asshat. He saw one of V's ex boyfriends at the bar and lost it. He began verbally abusing me and V and using intimidating body language towards us. He got mildly phisical with Jordan, bumping him and intimidating him like a bully in elementary school would do. 

Finally V had enough and decided to stay the night at mine and Jordans house. She says she broke up with him, but she still has a house with him and all of her stuff is there. They share a dog, the dog is his, but it is terrified of him and basically became hers. She wants the dog. They have broken up and separated three times in the past, so it may be likely that they will amend again.

Ray will stalk and harass her while she is at our house. He already tried this morning, but he knows damn good and well that I will have his ass thrown in jail (even against V's wishes -you can not have police contact while on probation). I have 0 tolerance to bullying and abuse, especially in my safe home that Jordan and I have created. 

Today she is in my home. She is welcome for an unlimited amount of time. I told her she should take a few days here for the two of them to calm down and for her to get a plan together. I don't know if she will take the offer or not. She has a toothbrush, socks, and underwear here and I have enough clothes to get her by. 

She knows she is in a bad spot. If I prod too hard for her to get away from him, I will be no better than him (this dude gaslights her hard core), and I may push her away from me instead. 

How can Jordan and I firmly, but gently advise her as to what she can do? She is scared of messing up her probation, scared of him, scared of the change that leaving will cause (she has built a beautiful home, but it is Rays house). She is scared to loose her dog, she is scared she will have no place to go, she is not completely financially independent at the moment. She has a full time but low paying job and could not get into an apartment of her own for months. 

I was once in an abusive relationship and no matter what anyone said, I did not leave until my life was in danger. Even then, I considered going back and downplayed the situation in my head. I am afraid that V is going through this now and I want to help her before she ends up with the same scars I carry. Unfortunately, I am not good at logic, I make emotional and sometimes rash decisions. My advice and decisions are not usually bad, but after a while I realize I could have handled things in a much better way. This is why I am asking Reddit. You guys are not in the middle. Please help me help her figure this out.",1in5million,2019-02-17 16:34:02,1,1444,46.74,81.98,7.1,15.95,16.79,11.29,89.27,57.55,18.7,15.51,3.95,1.59,0.28,8.66,1.04,3.19,4.92,14.06,8.38,4.16,7.83,2.01,17.04,4.29,1.87,0.48,1.25,1.32,6.09,2.7,3.39,0.97,0.76,0.76,16.55,0.21,0.97,5.68,3.53,11.22,2.01,1.66,2.15,2.77,0.97,3.12,2.15,1.04,0.48,0.48,2.56,0.62,0.62,0.07,1.45,9.76,3.46,1.18,3.19,2.08,0.83,5.47,10.66,1.87,13.92,2.22,6.72,4.85,0.9,1.8,1.11,0.21,0,0.07,0.76,0.21,0.14,0.07,0.14,0,15.17,6.09,4.43,0.69,0,0.14,0,0.21,0.14,0.83,2.08,0.55

arslgi,I am struggling,"I am having mixed feelings. This relationship has been two years too long. The physical, verbal, and emotional abuse has torn me down. 

The last time he hit me, and I thought he broke my jaw, I realized I was not going to marry this man. This was not the first display of physical abuse. 

The gas lighting, yelling, controlling etc, is making me go insane. Now I am at the point where I am just trying to figure out when I can leave. 

He is a prominent figurehead at the prestigious university I am attempting to get into in the next year. So my goal is to leave him once I am accepted. But when will it stop? Will he sabotage me? Will anyone believe me over him? 

Our dogs. These dogs are like our children. And often all I have for comfort. One dog is 50/50. But he constantly says that I will never have the dog if I leave. I'm worried this is true. 

I feel like I am nothing. I am a social science researcher, trusted by countless university faculty. But I still feel like a failure. I feel like I am going to amount to nothing. 

How will I adjust to a normal relationship after this? How will I build back bridges I burned because of this? 

I am much younger than him, and in a different point in my life, yet he feels as though I should be performing as someone his age. This is impossible, obviously. Just another thing to make me feel less-than. 

Recently, it has been my ""attitude"". I say anything and I have an attitude. I correct anything and I have an attitude. I need anything and I have an attitude. This comes with aggression and yelling. Nothing I can even measure. I could look lost in thought and be accused of having a bitchy attitude. I can't even be silent without being accused of something, but anything I say is judge extremely and dismissed. 

I am listening to the author of Why Does He Do That? And feeling extremely sad.

Award #4.  A.  I asked A. for help and she responded by blocking me on messenger.

&amp;#x200B;

Award #5.  C.  C. offered to let me move into her guest cottage.  Until I looked at booking a flight.  Then she changed her mind and said it was my fault because I mentioned I might have somewhere else to stay.  She sent thoughts and prayers.

&amp;#x200B;

Award #6.  S.  S. told me to call the cops and never replied again.

&amp;#x200B;

Award #7.  Dear Mother.  She left me a voice message saying she wanted to come get me, but without acknowledging the violence just said that I would just ""destroy"" her ""because I wouldn't want to see her"".  All about her.  Even when I was 7 months pregnant, she again suggested I was going to hell for her assumption that I am not going to let her see ""her"" grandchild.

arzixb,Friend getting a divorce.,"My friend is asking her husband for a divorce today.  She's asked me to keep their firearms in my safe ""until he cools down."" How do I do this safely? Knowing my husband (who isn't abusive but is an avid Hunter), he'd never calm down/forgive the person who touched his guns.  There'd be glares and grumbles until the day he died.

When/if we reach that point, do I call the police to facilitate the return?  Do I give them to my friend to handle? (which seems like a recipe for disaster if he's violent towards her when things are going relatively well)

Should I call her back and tell her to drop the guns off at the police station?  The local PD has a terrible reputation for not returning property and money in general..

as0697,Is this a sign of emotional abuse or is it just me?,"I will try to keep this short. I was in an abusive relationship (physical, emotional, psychological, and abusive) prior to dating this new man so I was hesitant to start dating again. This new man and I had sex and he came inside. After we had sex, it wasn't awkward at all, in fact he made me realize what and how sex should feel like. We talked and cuddled all night but a week later he became distant. I didn't understand how he was able to open up to me that deeply and walk away as if it was nothing. Back to the topic, I got an IUD back in 2015, but apparently it expired. I realized I was pregnant when I kept getting symptoms so I took 8 tests; one was negative the other were positive. When I told him the news, he broke down crying as so did I because I'm not ready to become a mother. Ultimately, I decided to end it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I came over on the weekend to talk about plans. All of a sudden, he tells me he bought a test to see if it's really true. I got completely furious as I did not come over to be interrogated.  He starts calling me a liar, claiming that I only faked this to see him when I have a bunch of other situations going on; the last thing I wanted was to get pregnant. Keep in mind, this man already has a child from a previous marriage/relationship so you would think he learned his lesson. I already knew what my plans were and I didn't need a man to tell me 18-20 times to end it as it was already a difficult situation in itself. He starts yelling and telling me to pee on the pregnancy test. It doesn't take a genius to figure out if he is okay with yelling, ridiculing, and insulting my character then it would not be surprising if he wanted me to pee in front of him or put a camera in his bathroom to see if it's really true. It's a cycle of him not taking ownership/responsibility that it's not his child, paying support, etc. I felt as if he treated me like an animal yelling me to pee on a stick. This is what they do in prison or terrorists, forcing them to drop their pants, pee in front of them or bend over, cough and see if anything is stuck in there. Emotions were high and there was a lot of yelling, screaming and I felt as if I was a rape victim again. I haven't had that feeling for years and the feeling seemed as fresh as it happened yesterday. I remember when people doubted my story, authorities shaming and blaming me, friends and family disbelieving me to the extent where I fell into a deep depression. Additionally, this behavior of his made me view him in a different light and I couldn't see him the same way anymore. Yelling, ridiculing, insulting and insinuating demanding I pee in front of him made me feel like less of a person. Is this emotional abuse?  Am I wrong to think this?",itsmeamelia,2019-02-18 10:19:19,3,550,33.98,34.44,77.1,1,18.97,15.45,94.55,60.18,21.09,14.36,8.73,0.36,0.18,4.36,0.73,6.73,5.82,13.64,8.36,5.09,9.27,2.36,20.36,5.27,2.91,1.82,0.91,1.09,7.09,1.27,5.64,0.73,3.09,0.55,11.64,1.09,0.18,0.18,5.09,13.82,3.64,1.09,2.73,3.45,1.64,5.09,3.45,1.27,1.09,1.09,2.73,0.91,1.09,1.27,0,7.27,1.82,0.91,2.55,1.45,0.73,10,8.55,0.91,15.09,1.64,7.45,6.36,1.45,0.55,0.36,0.36,0,0,0.18,0,0,0.18,0,0,13.82,4.73,4.55,0,0.73,0.55,0,0.18,0,2,0.36,0.73

as4ksg,At my abusers house today ... Two steps backward,"I guess this is what progress looks like.
Going back and concretizing my drive to leave.

This is still progress.
I am ready to let go.
He got violent with me only 4 days ago.

I am going to one day never see him again.
I am going to raise baby fine without choking.
I am going to do good and find safety.

I spent 2 hours cleaning my house, when he was on his way to pick me up.  I did it so thoroughly.  So he wouldnt criticize me.  I swept the floor three times.  I did every dish.  I put out lavender and eucalyptus because he hates the smell.  I cleaned the porch and front steps and even the area in front of them.  

He still got mad at me.  Because I took 15 minutes to finish showering and make a smoothie and pack my backpack and put on the first clothes I could find.  Meanwhile he lost his patience about me not being a good enough listener and I started to slouch really bad.  Shoulders all the way forward.  He grabbed me to kiss me and I just felt I was looking at the devil.

He threatened to take me home because I was upset.  I tried to make smalltalk but he replied by saying I was disassociating a lot lately.  Bullshit.  He originally lost his patience because I was being ""fakely enthusiastic"".  If he liked me, it wouldn't matter.

So what I am lost.  Been there done that.

So what I feel just as disliked by him, as I did when we first met a very long time ago.

So what I didn't trust my gut, and truly betrayed myself.  I AM going to get out INTACT.

So what I am drowned by jealous sadness.  So what it is a fake distraction - like one of the hundreds of keys I have made to try to unlock how to get him to be kind and nonviolent.  I WILL get over it. 

So what if I am back in hell for the day.  NOT like I am staying here.

So what if someone will replace me.  So what if he beats me any time you get jealous.  So what if the truth is all he really wants is his ex back, and she wants him, and I am literally just this smart highly successful pretty girl standing in the way.

So what if a girl called him today and he made plans with her but if I ask about them he will literally hit my head.

So what if he hit my head hard so many times, I really can't say the right words.  Like seriously.  I will get a speech therapist.

So what if the thought of another woman hurts more than being punched in the face while driving, or having to drive him for hours after he punched my back so hard I couldnt walk.  So what it was only 2018 and 2019.  

So what his lie about ""working on"" his anger is bullshit and like OJ Simpson, he would probably just yell at his grave.  It is non-negotiable that I truly HATE him.  Few mixed feelings.

So what if he has cut down every branch of my belief in self.  And poisoned some of my roots.  And may murder me.  

I am going to steal home base like Jackie Robinson in the World Series and one day be FREE.

Fuck this shit.  I am progress right where I am.  I just need people to believe in me.

as67wy,"It’s been a year and a half of on again/off through an EOP, and him relapsing multiple times. Last time I thought he would hurt me I tricked him into letting me take him to my friends house. She got him into recovery. Kept up contact, today I tried to break up over the phone. He showed up banging.","So I tried to be as detailed in description before running out of characters. Not really looking for advice, more looking to vent and discuss. Tonight’s been pretty rough. We’ve had a crazy 1.5 years. Sometimes amazing, sometimes horrific. He’s physically, and sexually abused me a few times. The emotional abuse/manipulation has been the most damaging. I hate that I love him. My best friend who is the one who got him back into detox/rehab after his last relapse was previously in an abusive relationship. She’s known him longer than I’ve known either of them (met her through him, the only really good outcome so far). She told me that: a) I’m worth more than that treatment. B) that I’m not helping him by staying with him, which is part of why I’ve stayed with him throughout all of the crazy nonsense. So tonight when we spoke on the phone, I very kindly/diplomatically/logically told him when he goes to the half way house we need to be just friends because I’ve feel like all he does is use me. He said “why don’t I come over, I’ll leave here and come over.” I told him not to come, that I wouldn’t open the door. He said ok, that we had a lot more to talk about next time we spoke. Then like half an hour later he was banging on my door. At first I wasn’t sure if it was my neighbor. So I started to creep down the stairs, I saw him through the hall window walking around. I went back to my room and texted my best friend. He continued banging for so long. I started sobbing and panicking. She called the police. By the time they came I guess he’d left. I felt so stupid sobbing in front of the police that he’d been staying with me, even though I had a temp op for no harassment (the judge wanted to keep it no contact, but he’d already been talking to me and manipulating me again by that point) so I told her “no, I only need temp no harassment.” Telling the police that I think the temp expired, that he’d relapsed and gone to treatment. That I’d still been talking to him while he was in treatment to encourage him to get better. That he showed up here and sobbing to them. The one cop having sympathy in his eyes, the other looking uncomfortable. I felt ashamed I wanted to crawl out of my skin. When they left I went up to my bed and sobbed so hard I wished I would die. My best friend called me and gave me some tough love. Without her tough love I don’t know where I’d be right now. Instead of sitting alone in the bathtub trying to cope with the emotional turmoil, I might be restarting another cycle of abuse with the same guy. Now though, since he left the treatment center before being placed in the half way house he has no where to go, so he’s going there. Which makes me want to scream because on one hand I do t want him to be on the cold streets, but I also don’t want him to be there! Like going there makes me feel so good, and while he’s there I’m not going to feel like I can go. My best friend has a lot of health issues, she said she’ll come to my house, but I also know she probably won’t. I’m so mad and I feel so alone I want to scream. I don’t have really any friends other than her. Now she’s stopped texting probably because she’s dealing with him. Like he has so much control, it’s either I take care of him, or he cuts me off from my support by having them take care of him. It makes me want to kill myself, but that thought breaks my heart because “who would take care of my cat?” She’s the center of my world, and my reason for living some days, the thought of me killing my self and her having nobody rips my heart out of my chest. So many times he’s made my soul leave my body. Every time it leaves and comes back I think a piece doesn’t come back. I’m so tired of my world revolving around him. I feel so broken I don’t want to do it anymore, but I also don’t know what the fuck I’m doing. I feel idol in time and like I can’t stop time but I also can’t move through it.

as7b23,Co-parenting with my abuser,"So....this is going to sound insane, I imagine. In some way.

I'm preparing to leave my abusive relationship. The abuse has been primarily emotional, psychological, a bit financial, just overall very controlling and unhealthy. It's only gotten physical and sexual a few times, and still ""not that bad"". I know better than to say that, but I'm sure many of you know what I mean. Anyway, I have a child from a previous relationship, and also a 6 month old baby. In leaving my boyfriend, I will have a custody and child support battle, which TERRIFIES me. Especially learning about how the laws don't automatically favor mothers, even when children are still infants. Here is my conundrum....since I know that I will likely have to co-parent with my abuser, given that even convicted felons can get supervised and sometimes unsupervised visitation with their kids, is it even worth it to try to get a restraining order and bring up the abuse in court? Since legally speaking, it definitely ""isn't that bad."" Do I owe it to my daughter to try my best to keep her father away from her? He's never done anything to her, but then again she is a lovable infant. Who knows how he might treat her in the future. He seems to so genuinely love her. Ugh. I know leaving might give me better perspective, it's just so hard knowing that I can't actually prevent him from seeing her forever.",vpetrucci,2019-02-18 22:20:40,5,253,20.65,51.58,60.07,19.84,14.06,18.58,94.47,57.71,20.16,13.44,8.3,0,0.4,4.35,0.4,6.72,4.74,11.07,9.49,9.88,6.72,1.98,20.16,3.95,1.58,2.37,0.4,1.58,8.3,3.95,4.35,0.4,2.37,0,13.04,2.37,0.4,3.56,2.37,14.62,4.74,1.98,0,3.56,1.98,2.77,1.98,0.4,1.19,0.4,1.58,0,0.79,0.4,0,10.28,2.37,1.98,3.95,2.37,1.19,1.98,15.02,3.16,11.07,1.98,2.77,5.93,2.37,0,0,1.19,0,0,0.79,0,0,0,0.4,0.4,21.74,9.09,6.32,0,0,0.79,0,0.79,1.58,3.16,0,0

asb52z,My friend is about to be homeless with their abusive father,"I have a friend that I've been talking to for about 2 years now. Ever since we started talking they've occasionally told me about their living situation and the family they live with. Here's what I can gather.

Their father is abusive. He can't handle people questioning his authority and verbally abuses my friend all the time. If my friend or their brother try to stand up for themselves they get hit and they've become too scared to act now. The father also manages his money terribly, buying junk food and hearthstone card packs for his failed twitch channel instead of saving up and making sure his family can live safely. Because of this, they have less than a week to gather 600 dollars so they can stay where they currently live and not get kicked to the street.

Their mom is messed up in the head. She was abused by her mother and other family as well. I don't know what she has but her mind is basically the mind of a child's or a teen's and she isn't any help, especially since she agrees with anything the father says. She doesn't bring in any cash and can't do anything for my friend. She did call a place for money and they promised they'd help and send double the 600 they needed but they haven't got back to her yet and it's looking bad.

Their brother is kinda just there..? He talks to him occasionally but other than that I don't hear much, so I assume he's basically in the same boat as my friend.

My friend doesn't know how to drive and has to rely on their father to drive them places (which he refuses to do half the time) and because of this he can't get a driver's license or find a job. There isn't a job in walking distance and they're already terrified of going outside because of an incident that happened a couple years ago and being held up at home hasn't helped their mindset. He was barely able to convince his dad to get him glasses so he could see properly. They aren't allowed to call or try and get help, and their only form of help is talking to me. We've tried to find resources to help but he can't act on any of them or his dad will fuck it up. 

My reason for just now reaching farther out for help is that this morning they messaged me saying they were going to kill themselves wednesday morning. I was able to convince them not to, but I don't want them to be homeless or have to live with their terrible family anymore. If anyone has anything that can help that won't alert their father or cause a huge issue I would really really appreciate it. I would help them myself but I can't drive either and since I'm still in school I can't leave my state until next year or so, which will be too late.

My friend is a 20 year old male in Texas

I hope I didn't forget any details, but I have left out their address and names so nobody can directly intervene. Also this is my first time posting anything like this and I hope I've followed the rules well enough. 
I will also be calling a hotline and seeing how they can help",KingCalamarii,2019-02-19 06:46:53,1,578,15.27,66.12,49.56,18.15,20.64,12.28,93.77,61.94,20.93,16.26,5.71,0.35,0,4.33,5.88,4.67,4.15,12.46,11.07,6.75,9.52,3.63,19.55,2.25,1.56,1.21,1.21,1.73,3.63,1.56,2.08,0.35,1.04,0.17,20.07,2.77,1.38,1.9,4.67,15.4,1.9,2.08,1.56,5.02,1.04,6.75,1.04,0.52,0.52,0,1.56,0.17,1.04,0.17,0.17,10.03,4.84,1.38,4.33,1.04,0.52,4.15,14.88,1.38,12.46,2.08,4.84,5.88,1.04,0.87,1.04,1.04,0,0.17,0.69,0.17,0.17,0,0.35,0,12.11,4.67,1.38,0,0,0.17,0,0,0,5.54,0.35,0
asb9t3,"My (24F) boyfriend (24M) of just under 2 weeks got arrested on a domestic violence strangulation charge last night, and I am feeling very guilty","He knows about my history with my boyfriend who has an aggravated assault charge against me. He told me before that he doesn't understand how anyone could ever put their hands on someone they love. 

Last night we were arguing and he started choking me. I almost passed out and honestly thought he was going to kill me. I managed to get away and run a couple blocks down the road and hide out until I saw his car pass and then knock on random doors until someone answered.

He is now sitting in jail with a 3rd degree domestic violence strangulation charge. That sounds way worse than it was.

I can't help but feel guilty for calling the cops. I don't want him in any trouble.

aschp2,"Getting out, fairly easy. Going through the Injunction proccess has been more of a Hell Ride *long*","No clue on formatting. If anyone wants to lemme in on it, I'd do it. But I just need a rant. If anyone knows anymore outlets to go to, I'd appreciate it. It'll be long. Not gonna lie, pretty tragic mentally. Beating, mental demanding, rape. There has been a warning...

Also just want to say, everyone whose gotten out alive no matter what- you're winning. You're beautiful creatures that deserved the best. Rock it as such! :)


As it says, it really does seem like the Injunction process is the Hellish part. I'm wishing I never stuck to my word about dropping the Felony DV/Assault (second charge of DV, got bumped to Felony. Also was barely a year between his first and second that I KNOW OF). He swore he'd take anger management, said all the right words. I got him an attorney, talked to State Attorneys to drop it- all of it. Right before I got the date for the class I had to take, none of it mattered. He said he'd never do it. Few days later, he said he would but we both knew he was lying. I still planned on going through it. Made escape plans, called local Women's Centers for help and rant. They all begged me to come in, that he'll kill my daughter and I. I knew it deep down, I really did. After all, he promised I wouldn't live the relationship alive. Neither would my daughter. I suppose I had a death wish. Hell, I thought my own baby hated me. Always had her join in telling me how awful of a mom I was.  When he'd leave for work, she told me she loved me and don't worry mommy- He's mean. My beautiful (now) 5 year old was grasping the situation. I hated myself even more. 

Right before the class, we all went to an art festival. He was drunk, like always. Dancing with her. She bounced around all happy and excited till he leaned down. Her head hit his nose, and the demands to spank her started. It was an accident, you drunk fuck. I couldn't handle it so I walked off with her. He didn't know we left and was so enraged everyone moved out of the way when he was walking. He catch up when we were just about to cross a busy road, letting insults and threats flying. Told him I had no plans on coming with him. He needs to give me my keys back or leave us alone. Across the street he tried to pick my daughter up and run with her. I had to grab her bottom half to keep him from taking off with her. A shopkeeper or on-looker saw and came out (tried hunting this man down to give all the thanks, haven't been able to find him. I mentally thank him daily!) And called the cops. Said to leave us alone, that's fucked up. A bunch of other stuff but  I used that as our escape, grabbed her and ran to a local restaurant bathroom. I didn't get to make it that far before the ex caught back up and started yelling at me. I stopped when I saw a cop, his back was to said cop and let him unleash the verbal hell he wanted just praying the cop would hear. He got within ear shot, immediately asked if I was okay. Nodded, trying not to cry and ran as quick as I could. I hoped he heard the threats and arrest him there. Little did I know it wasn't the case. I hid in the bathroom for an eternity it felt like, crying with my daughter. She didn't know what happened, just asked why I was crying. After the 4th or 5th knock asking if I was almost done, I finally left the bathroom. Walking out, I realized then his jerk ass was waiting for us. I felt my heart drop and almost went into an immediate panic attack. I bit back my words and accepted it. We walked with him back to the car, all the berating and demeaning words went flying. Finally getting back to the car, we all got in. Didn't even make it down the road before he started punching me in the chest, screaming and drunken driving. I held my tongue, I knew he could drive drunk. Not a good thing but I had no say so. Even if it was my car. He didn't care.

He beat everything he could in the car. Door handle and buttons for my windows are busted up, window has a small crack. Arm rest is dented up. Whatever it was probably got hit. I tried making another escape, taking her for a walk. He took her shoes so she couldn't go with me. I said fuck it, I'm gonna try still. Grabbed her and refused to go inside. Insisting on going for a walk to calm down. He was dead set on not letting me. I still tried. My little one then insisted on going to bed, he screamed at her to get inside. I tried stopping her. But it didn't help. He locked me in our room till he got back from putting her to bed, made me tell her mommy is fine. It's okay with his hand around the back of my neck. Threatening he'd stab me if not. 

Getting back to the room, he never showed on the demeaning, belittling, or vial comments. Just worsened. Till he decided it was okay to tie me up with his belt and rape me. Begging never helps. Never got processed into his disgusting mind. Wouldn't ask someone if they liked it if they were begging right? Because I didn't enjoy it, most reasonable choice was to get a swift punch. Stars were seen, slumping down to the floor grabbing my face. Trying to spit the blood out and pull my tooth that almost completely went through my cheek out. I shouldn't be mad though, he got a shower ready for me and a bucket to spit blood into. Even ice. That was nice, right? No, it is never fucking nice. And that is not in any shape or form deserving of  forgiveness. 

6 days before the disposal of the felony DV, I walk into that class face still swollen. Biggest black, purple and green bruise on my face smeared in make up to mask it. But it worked. Though, Advocate that ran it knew better. She asked me 639 times if I was sure. But at least, he was watching my daughter. I couldn't say elsewise. I was scared. It was disposed off 2 weeks later. Bruise wasn't even healed yet. That was back in October, early-mid. Pretty sure my cheek is scarred. Now February and I still have tissue forming around, but at least its getting kind of smaller? 

Nothing really hit me till 2-3 later. I started building an even bigger rage and hate for him. It was all wonderful till my mom's and aunt's birthday. I was forbidden to see them. Even though we made it within feet to tell them happy birthday. He stated blocking their numbers. Tried ""allowing me to do stuff"" which wasn't anything new. I should of been thankfully I got 3-4 cigarettes a day while he could smoke a half. While sleeping at work or screaming at me, right? 

The 2 weeks before I left. I made one attempt. Got to the hospital and x-rayed, catscan, documented all the bruises and jazz. I was threatened to get beat if I didn't bleach the walls. We smoked inside. I wasn't allowed outside for a cig unless he was home. Even claimed to install sercurity camera to make sure I wasn't running outside. They were never there. I did, my big rebel fuck you daily. I handed a key to the neighbors that just moved in, they've heard him being a bastard, screaming (drunken night of him beating me in my daughter's room when my mom took munchkin for the night, thank god. She was a bail bondsman, yay! And had a gun. She was literally my saving grace on so many levels. Her boyfriend too. Even Scott heard and knew, he got in the ex's face one evening and said 'if you're feeling froggy, jump at me. Don't hit your girl'. He looked like a kicked dog, it was pretty rad, not gonna lie). He later once again, convinced me to come back. Went to my parent's house with munchkin.  A few days later, they took my car. Mom's name was co-signer. His wasn't. I didn't have a job, he refused to pay for it. So off it went. Found out he had a suspended license that the officer took. Not paying court fees (previous DV charge, funny that). 

Now December 15th, was the biggest highlight. It was the day I left. After my stepdad was on the way to get us to do laundry while he was at work, he forgot and said to tell him to go home. I tried talking to Phil. But the ex's rage showed it's ugly head again and he said his typical, "" hope your family dies"" nonsense, I finally grew the balls. I said fuck you, shove it. I'm done. My stepdad got us, we grabbed clothes and movies for munchkin. And we got the fuck out! I felt like hell the first bit. He was blowing my phone up. Calls and texts. First 3 hours I had a good 200+ missed calls, 400 messages. I turned it off. Checked once more to call the women's center and let them know we're coming, I didn't have any room for new messages on voicemail. Phone was telling me to free space. 


It is now in February, we're both very much alive and away. I've had 4 court dates. I've been subpoenad to testify at a road rage incident with the ex way back from August. Praying he doesn't come or if I can get out. So far, I have to show for that. But he's not getting served. In hiding from the injunction. He's texting me a few times. Last was my name and question mark last weekend. It's sent me in a whirlwind of emotions. I'd do just about anything to have him served. He's been making fake profiles to report my Facebook, even using the one I had that he demanded use of to disable. Stating they're fake. Two police reports of stalking and cyber stalking later, I'm really hoping he's stopped. But who knows anymore. Next court date is March 3th. I'm dreading it. But I have my support system. After all of this, I'm changing my degree and attempting to go back to college for social work. No one deserves any brutality or feeling subhuman. Yes, still struggling sometimes. But it's a slow process that daily gets better. If anyone has any suggestions of him getting served, etc. Or what to do, I'm all ears. :)",xi-dead,2019-02-19 08:53:56,3,1869,37.63,46.58,68.65,17.25,9.84,13.43,90.64,55.27,20.22,15.41,7.97,1.02,0.43,5.46,0.54,4.82,5.14,12.47,8.72,5.14,6.15,2.73,22.26,4.71,2.19,0.75,1.5,1.93,6.21,2.78,3.37,0.48,2.03,0.37,12.89,0.96,0.21,2.19,4.39,11.02,1.82,1.12,1.98,2.84,1.66,3.8,3.05,0.8,1.5,0.64,2.84,1.44,0.43,0.48,0.48,8.83,1.87,1.5,3.16,2.3,0.75,10.49,7.7,1.18,17.76,3.64,7.92,6.9,0.91,1.07,1.02,0.37,0.43,0.37,1.34,0.7,0.27,0.27,0,0,20.22,9.74,4.76,0,0,0.21,0.21,0.48,0.21,3.85,0.54,0.21
asdn50,"he said ""I'm sorry I choked you""","He got so mad recanting our text exchange earlier in the day (and he was clearly mad about something else) that while we are supposed to be having dinner together he starts shouting, slamming shit around the kitchen and closed the windows and blinds.  I started to shake and cry silently because I already knew something was going to happen. He grabbed me by the throat.  He yelled ""I should choke you!"" and then he pulled away. And then he's mad because I'm looking at him like he's a monster, WAITING for him to hurt me \[more\].  He moves to grab my wrist and then throws it from him (actual restraint? who knows) But continues to shout threats and call me a stupid ass bitch.   Said it was my fault he didn't go pick up his money because he woke up to my fucked up texts and it put him in a bad mood so instead he went to pick up some beers because I make him want to drink.  

&amp;#x200B;

When he stopped himself from hurting me further part of me felt like he was acting so he can say later that he held back and he's trying to be better.  His tirade was eventually interrupted by his phone ringing and his coworker/friend saying he was going to drop off his wallet (he had left it in his car the night before).  And then suddenly all was well and he's asking me if I want to meet his friend.  I'm tearful and pitiful looking and say no thanks. why would I even want to?  what the fuck even just happened right now and you're gonna 180 to normal convo and think I want to meet your friend?

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm sorry, babe"" randomly peppered throughout the rest of evening.  Sad glances.  I don't even know what to say anymore.  Am I supposed to say ""I understand"" or ""its my fault"" or ""its OK""? because it obviously isn't.  At one point he actually says ""I'm sorry for choking you"".  When is that kind of response (choking your significant other) ever OK?  I wasn't threatening him, or physically hurting him.  Nothing.  I just got home from work, and was sitting at the dinner table when he brought up how I TEXTED ""why are you giving me a hard time"" because he complained how I left him on read while I was working. He blew up from there, remembering the TEXT MESSAGES.  That him asking why I left him on read isn't a hard time.  That he can show me what a hard time really is. 

&amp;#x200B;

He wakes up early, because he's restless.  He goes to the corner store to grab me coffee, a large bottled water for me to take to work, and coconut macaroons.  Wakes  me up to his ""gifts"" (but I'm already awake). Trying to make up for last night? I feel emotionally dead at this moment.  My neck, just under my chin, is tender on either side (there is no bruising, he only squeezed hard and long enough for me to feel, not see, the echo of his fingers the next day).  But I thank him. I put on a show that I'm happy and it's the sweetest thing.  But I don't care.  I am sad.  Because I loved this asshole.  I look out for him and support him.  This is how he ""loves"" me.  It's been three years.  I don't want to send him to prison or wish anything bad upon him, I'm not vindictive - I just don't want to be with him anymore.  I've tried to leave him a few times.  This time I PRAY I stay away.   Just getting my ducks in a row.

asf373,"35/f single mom trying to leave , I have no one , please help","I have been with my bf for a year and a half . I am a single mom to a 3 year old daughter , who’s father has not been involved due to domestic violence and not showing up at family court to set up visitation . I met my current partner 6 months after breaking up with my daughters father. Things did move fast , as he was wonderful and really seemed interested in the family life . I did not introduce him to my daughter until we were 4 months in, however . At that point we had been spending a lot of time together , no arguments and once he met her it was perfect because she seemed to really love him. My background is that I struggle with PTSD due to a tragic event in my life , and I also struggle with insecurities and had started accusing my bf of not being faithful once we moved in together because he started seeming shady, little things like when we would get into arguments he would leave the house and disappear for the night instead of communicating , and when I would disagree with any of his actions he would get very angry and enraged at me and blame me . It seemed like the loving person I met slowly started to disappear . Around Christmas time of the next year, he was drinking too much and started calling me names then he threw a drink in my face . Due to being abused before and my ptsd I lost it and picked up a broom and hit him with it . He then came at me and pushed me to the floor and began kicking my face . Luckily my daughter was not home this night . Finally he stopped and realized what he was doing and begged for my forgiveness,crying and bringing me ice for my face . At this point I was a mess I turned numb couldn’t think or move to Call police just went and lay down . In the morning he told me how he hasn’t been honest and that he grew up in an abusive home where his father beat him regularly and even needed stitches several times . 
I’ve always had a lot of empathy so stupid me didn’t leave . I don’t deserve any readers sympathy for not leaving and I know this . Anyway he stayed living here and things went more normal. My daughter never witnessed any yelling or abuse but what happened was he withdrew more and more, instead of being an involved stepfather he would go to work , come home and play video games for hours or stay in the bedroom while I played and ran errands , cleaned , cooked or spent time with my daughter.
Then the abuse happened again one night after he drank. I called police and had him charged . He moved out . Yet kept contact , his things are still here at my house and he refuses to get them. I have started seeing a therapist for my ptsd and find it to be unhelpful . He keeps contacting, seeking pity , blaming me, and I keep giving in mainly because I have no family support, no friends,  I am struggling to finish my degree, my daughter still loves him and talks about him everyday .but I keep remembering what he’s done . He blames me,says if I trusted him and didn’t accuse him of cheating all the time he would still be the loving man I met . He was only happy when I was doing all the right things . But for some reason I still feel like I’m to blame .  He was here this past week , spent time here but woke up angry because my daughter was loud and left in an angry huff , screaming at me. What can I do ? My mental health is bad , I know I have to cut this off , none of my family knows , I feel like a shell, no self esteem or worth, suicidal , and now I learn he’s been using hard drugs . Please tell me I’m not in the wrong and if I am how can I change myself , heal , do the right things ? I am a single mom who is always alone , no one checks on me, no one cares . Thank you for listening .",canadianmama1,2019-02-19 12:38:08,8,723,25.54,47.79,80.41,7.92,20.66,13.69,95.57,57.95,19.92,16.32,9.96,0.55,0.14,5.53,0.14,3.6,4.15,11.34,8.99,4.84,8.99,2.9,21.16,3.73,1.52,1.66,1.94,2.35,7.61,3.04,4.56,0.55,2.35,0.69,15.21,2.63,0.83,1.8,6.22,10.37,2.21,1.38,1.38,2.77,0.97,3.6,1.8,0.69,0.69,0.41,2.21,0.41,0.97,0,0.55,7.75,3.73,0.69,2.49,0.55,0.55,9.68,8.99,0.41,17.29,3.46,5.81,8.58,0.69,1.52,1.66,0.55,0.28,0.14,0.41,0,0.28,0,0,0.14,11.34,4.56,4.84,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,1.52,0,0.14

asm7zk,Long. Ass. Post. Am i too blame too?,"I’m not sure where to even begin. My STBX has me believing he’s the victim in this story, and everything is my fault. This is about to be TERRIBLY long. Apologies. 

In March 2016, i got divorced from a man i had been with for 9 years... i didn’t really date seriously for several months and then i met “A”. We met December 2016, and got pregnant quickly (oops.) Since i am older, and i felt my time was running out, and he did too, we decided to keep the baby.

Things were good. He got a job at the bar i managed. I would say he worked there for about a month when he was found drinking a bottle of whiskey in the back and was quickly fired. I threatened to leave, if that was going to be his behavior how great of a dad could he be? He convinced me to stay, that it would never happen again.

He took a job at a new restaurant and i followed as a server since the bar was getting to be too much during pregnancy. He’s a very talented cook so they had him working a ton. I show up for a shift one day and one of the other servers lets me know “A” is drunk. Fired from that job too. When i searched the car we shared i found at least 10 empty pint bottles of various whiskeys.. so this had been going on for some time. Once again, leaving came up, and more convincing.

We move in with his family as baby’s arrival is closer and closer. He leaves his iMessage up one day on his laptop, I’m not usually a snooping type, but something caught my eye. I found at least 5 women that he was texting he loved them, wanted to marry one of them, etc. Massive fight of course. One of the girls he had always convinced me was just his “best friend” and my ultimatum was that he cut all contact. He agreed. I think it’s around this point that i really start to resent him. I hadn’t really fought back “hard” against him until this point.

Things are good for awhile. On the night of October 13th i receive a message on Facebook warning me that my boyfriend wanted to run off with her. Baby boy is born the very next day and is absolutely perfect. My delivery, not so much. Emergency csection, and then an infection so i was basically couch ridden for awhile. I still took care of the kid as best i could but i definitely needed assistance. I’m a very independent person so this was really hard and led to some serious PPD as well, i got medicated for awhile and it really helped. I stopped taking it eventually, and i haven’t had any depressed feelings, I’m happy most of the time. My self esteem is low, but if you keep reading you’ll certainly see why lol. 

In January, “A” has a total mental break and is drunker than I’ve seen anybody. Like, he didn’t even know where he was. He blamed me for the drinking saying he had been taking care of two babies, he blamed me for making him stop being friends with that woman, etc. He punches a hole in the wall, and shoved his dad and brother around, he said things to me like that he would make sure I never got to see my son again. His mom is generally no help and says it’s my problem to deal with and also that I’m partially to blame because i fight back. I pack up the baby and go to a friends house. “A” decided then he wants to kill himself and goes to the hospital. Begs me to come back. Goes through the hold process and is simply diagnosed with anxiety, doesn’t even start therapy.

Things are good for awhile, one or two arguments but nothing “extreme” — we get married and finally move out of his family’s home.

I can’t remember what caused the first incident but it was bad enough the police were called because he put his hands on my neck and shoved me down, but also tried to keep me from leaving. Alcohol definitely involved. Baby and i go stay at a friends house and once again, I’m met with promises of it never happening again.


About a month ago I had abdominal surgery and would be unable to go to my job for 6 weeks. Everyone seemed on board with this, it was going to be hard, but we would figure it out. Two weeks post op, his mom starts complaining to him that there’s no reason i should be in any pain, and I’m just faking it all to avoid going back to work. He does fight for me there, but something definitely made him “snap” because that next day we fight about it before he goes to work. We sort of make up, and then he leaves. On his ~15 min drive to work he calls me and really starts berating me, saying things like I’m a terrible mother, I’m lying about being in pain, i just want to lie around the house, he’s taking care of  two toddlers and can’t handle it. I had the sense to record this entire conversation.

Now i should add, that most of the housework is always up to me, even though we both work crazy restaurant hours. He typically just does the laundry, but the cleaning, dishes, etc, that’s all me. I don’t complain about it. It’s been two weeks of him needing to take care of things. And really just the dishes and laundry as i deep cleaned the apartment the day before my surgery. The baby hasn’t even been in the home but staying with my parents as i wasn’t allowed to pick him up yet.

He calls again and says he’s not going into work, he’s just gonna come home. Fine, see you in 15 minutes. An hour goes by. I start calling his phone. After call 15 or so he picked up and you could actually hear how drunk he was. He lied and said he was at work and i was bothering him... but when i looked out the blinds i saw the car several spaces down with him, barely able to keep his eyes open, in it. I take some blame for this as i stormed out there and yelled at him. But i decide i don’t want to escalate the fight further and call my friend to come pick me up so i can stay at her house. He escalated everything, when i asked for the car keys he refused, he blocked my exit from the bedroom, he shoved me, he pushed me hard in the stomach (where you know, i just had surgery) —- it’s so loud, the neighbors above us call the police. He manages to put on a sober act for them and makes me out to be the unstable one who needs help. No arrests, the cops ask us to be apart for the night.

THE VERY NEXT DAY, I come home because my son is coming home. I work on picking him up, it’s hard, it hurts, but i manage it. John feels ok leaving me with him to go to work. He calls again and starts fighting, bringing up his same point that he did the other day. With a new one added in, that i don’t ever touch him. I can’t remember the last time we had sex honestly. But would you want to have sex with someone that’s repeatedly acted like this?
Once off the phone with him, i ask my parents to come over because i don’t want to be alone if he comes home. Which he does, completely drunk. I don’t even let him speak to me, i just quietly call the police. Having him around the baby in that state is dangerous and I’m not standing for it. He calls his mother who races up to our apartment. She wants to take him to the hospital, fine, he needs help, clearly. She starts screaming at me, that i started all of this by being dramatic, when i started to cry, she made fun of me. When i told her i had recordings, she scoffed and said i was simply trying to manipulate the situation in my favor. I have no compassion for her son, I’m incredibly selfish, etc...

I end up going to a hospital as well as the shoving really has my stomach hurting again. They do a scan and it shows heavy internal bruising. I reach out to a divorce lawyer and start trying to figure out what to do. 

His brother starts messaging me on Facebook calling me selfish and I’m the one that caused all of this drama. But he also told me “A” had been so much worse before he met me, and that he had shoved him around in the past. Wat. I screenshotted the conversation, thanks for adding that to my evidence pile. I also find out “a” was not taken to the hospital as promised, but he’s simply at their house and going to talk to a pastor the next day. 
Pastor thinks it’s bipolar disorder that’s been undiagnosed. He goes and meets with a counselor who says no, it’s just anxiety, but he needs stronger medication. 

I’m really beginning to feel stupid now typing this all out. Foolishly, i allow him to return after a week apart with the hard set rules that he go to therapy once a week, never misses a dose of medicine, and doesn’t drink. The not drinking only lasts about a week, but it’s also only like one beer a night instead of his usual six. I can handle that. Things are better than they have been in awhile.

Last night i found him with cigarettes, i didn’t fight as it was 1am and i had to be at work at 3, i just wanted to go tf back to sleep,  but of course he starts trying to escalate. I just wanted him to throw them away. I record everything. He sees what I’m doing and says he has documentation of me Being unstable too. 

Earlier today he goes to therapy. Everyone’s in a good mood, we have some issues with noise from the neighbors across the hall but it’s not that serious. He calls me when therapy is over, talks about how great it was, that his therapist suggested HE be a therapist one day. Lmao. He gets home, i can immediately tell. “A” is a small guy, who doesn’t eat much, so any alcohol gets him drunk. I promise him i won’t be angry, but i can tell he had booze and i want to know why. First he lies about it, but then relents and said he had a double fireball. I REALLY don’t want to have another crazy situation so i calmly told him that i was just going to remove the baby and myself from the home for the night. He doesn’t fight this, surprisingly, but starts going on again about how I’m not affectionate and this and that. That he’s the victim and I’m to blame for all of his past behaviors. He’s a very needy person and if he’s not getting affection constantly he must melt away or something. 

The baby and i are at my parents right now. I haven’t slept. I know it’s time to cut and run, even more so after typing out this novel. I hate that he’s making me feel like all of this is my fault somehow. I obviously need to see a therapist for what he’s put me through, but i don’t feel I’m as “unstable “ as he claims.",dvthrow80,2019-02-20 01:09:09,12,1992,29.44,57.76,55.54,10.99,15.21,12.05,95.73,60.84,21.49,16.16,8.28,0.75,0.3,6.43,0.4,5.32,5.52,13.81,9.34,7.48,7.38,2.16,20.18,3.97,2.26,1.31,1.71,1.86,5.67,2.21,3.36,0.2,1.36,0.4,15.01,1.51,0.55,0.75,6.58,11.4,1.71,1.61,1.76,1.56,1.91,3.56,2.76,0.75,1,0.95,3.11,0.45,1.46,0.2,1.2,7.63,2.46,1.15,2.31,1.61,0.55,6.22,12.05,1.05,16.47,3.61,6.07,7.23,1.61,1.46,1.15,0,0.1,0.05,0.55,0.1,0.3,0.1,0.1,0,16.92,6.78,4.97,0,0,0.15,0,0.05,1.2,3.51,0.2,0.05

asvewu,My pregnant friend is being abused. What can I do?,"My friend (yes, really asking for a friend) has been off and on with her ex for a year. In March of last year she told me he choked her and got physical with her. She almost blacked out. They broke up for a while and got back together before breaking up again a few times. They started seeing each other again in November. She’s currently almost 10 weeks pregnant with his child.

On Monday she sent me this message: “He literally got mad I didn't want to fuck earlier and choke slammed me on the floor and like ripped my legs back to where they aren't supposed to go and hit me”.

She sent me a picture from a few days prior of her swollen ear with bruises on and around it. I told her she needs to report it and she says she shouldn’t bother. They’ve been off and on so many times, I know he’s going to apologize in a month or so and say he’s changed. It’s a familiar cycle. 

I guess what I’m asking is, can I, as a friend help her break the cycle? I know she wants to see the good in him but he’s beating her while she’s pregnant with his child. She also has a toddler around who I’m afraid is taking this all in. I want to report it but for some reason I’m hesitant.

asx7nw,Hey all. My ex was arrested this morning.,"He started accusing me of cheating and/ or wanting to cheat last night and he abandoned me at a bar. 

I have not cheated or tried to do so. 

I ubered home at 7. I went to bed at 10. Still can’t reach him after several calls and texts. He comes home drunk around 11 and I am in bed. 

He attacks me for well over an hour. Drags me by the hair- chokes me and slams my head on the ground repeatedly. 

I feel numb but my adrenaline still hasn’t subsided a day later. 

He passed out around 1 or 2 in another room. 
Around 5am he wakes up and tries to crawl into bed with me (like nothing happened. Like I didn’t almost die)

I say Can you plz sleep on the couch- I’m not comfortable. 

He says he’s going to work and he’s not sleeping anywhere. 

I say so go. 

Then he starts swinging. I grab my phone and run to the walk in closet to dial 911. 

Police show up and he half assedly tried to run. They tell me he “rolled over a fence so he’s probably still drunk”

They ask if I want to press charges. 
I say yes. 
Now my life is changing super fast 

But I have to move forward. 
It’s the only way. 

His sister says his family is devastated and they want me to drop charges and he’s never been like this before so our relationship must just be volatile. No apology at all or any empathy- just blame on me. So fuck all of them. 

This was one of the worst episodes but not the first. I am still figuring my shit out as of this weekend.

at056v,Friend jailed for self defence. Help me petition Icelandic president.,"I hope it is okay to post this type of thing.

My brave friend went to maximum security prison today in Iceland. She's from Australia. She's 28 yrs old.

She bit the tip of her ex husband's unwanted tongue off when he forced it in her mouth while holding her against a wall. 

He started to become abusive after their wedding, about 4 years ago, since then she experienced a slow but steadily increasing stream of abuse from him that culminated in this particular night of retaliation. 

The court of appeals in Iceland accepted as true, the evidence supporting her claims of historical abuse, the ex husband literally admitted to the abuse, including raping her, and drugging her amongst other things.  

But the court decision was such that the manner of her self defence (tongue biting) did not meet the standards set forth in precedent cases of self defence in Iceland, so was dismissed, and she was charged with grievous bodily harm.

The system failed her. The charges which she subsequently laid against the ex-husband have still not been progressed. This is appalling and seeing my friend heading to prison alone, is so sad. Her Icelandic friends surrounded her with tape on their mouths, symbolic of the silencing of her voice by the system. She has been so brave.

Please help spread the word. Below is our petition to the President of Iceland to pardon her. 

And a link to a video of her entrance into Max security prison earlier today.

Please sign the petition for Nara Walker. https://www.thepetitionsite.com/290/558/332/bring-nara-home/

at1aup,Struggling,"What I would give just to see you smile. I hardly ever saw you happy and at peace but when you found that place, like when you were creating aquariums or smoking weed and reminiscing with me, playing R&amp;B all night… I never wanted those nights to end. There were only a couple and it felt like we were best friends, soul mates, and I forgot all of the bad things that happened between us. I felt safe most of the time… but on edge still because of things that had happened between us. I would give anything to see you smile again and hope you are happy and at peace where you are. I wish you nothing but the best in life. I felt like we were destined to be together but how can I ever forget when you had turned on me and become the most horrible and violent person I had ever met in my life? I cannot forget that… it mars our relationship forever even when I had tried to make things better, however I could. You still treated me badly and I don’t even know if you realized. I have no idea what to think anymore. Did you ever love me?? I think you did… but I can’t talk to anyone and have them understand what a good person you were. I think some people see it, even though you did terrible things to me. How can I grow up without you? How can I move on and keep living life when you were supposed to be by my side?

at2w2v,If you even think you're in a relationship with an abuser you need to leave to protect yourself,"This is my story, it might trigger some sensitive people so please just be aware. I'm only 15, this was my first ever long term relationship, which lasted a year and a half. Started out great, I was in a dark place and he became my everything, I thought he was helping me. Eventually however we had an argument and from then on it went down hill, this guy I would have died for slowly treated me worse and worse, when he did anything awful to upset me he'd reel me back in with false apologies, fake love and fake compliments. His friends were definitely not nice, me and this lad would be on and off constantly as he continually dumped and got back with me, making me confused and feel worthless. Whenever I wasn't dating him his friends would bully me and tell me he was my only worth and that I belonged to him. It wasn't fun, he put greasy food down my top, continually mocked my family and when I was facing mental health issues he'd call me 'r*tarded' and 'autistic'. I felt so low, I'd beg for him to come back when he left and he loved feeling so powerful, laughing at me like I was pathetic. I got so low I got sent for mental help, I was unaware I was being abused, I tried to kill myself several times and even ended up in hospital for the most recent attempt. When he found out what I tried to do he shamed me for my failure, blame me, mock me. I just wanted to die so I'd never have to face any more of the hurt he caused me and I still came back, cause it felt like he was the one thing that gave me happiness even if it wasn't without consequence, the mind games. One time when we split he found out that I told some people he had told me to kill myself etc. He walked me home and screamed at me, he hit my head off a wall and choked me, when he did let go he followed me and wouldn't let me leave screaming that I deserved everything I got. I told his friend and he actually supported me, but this was turned quickly when a week later my boyfriend did it again, I can't remember what we argued about but he was walking away screeching verbal abuse and he saw me smile, he ran at me and grabbed me by the threat, I was hysterical and he ran away in case anyone came to help me. After this he flipped the entire thing, claimed he did nothing and then he 'pushed' me back to nothing and people actually believe him which is ridiculous. So yeah his friend became my enemy very fast, I went to the police for everything and I don't want to press charges, I'm 15 for gods sake. I have been threatened, called a liar, sworn at, in fact this morning his friends were ganged around my house when I went out, I'm scared they're going to attack me, he blocked my path when I went around a corner to leave where his friends couldn't see, he started screaming at me to 'get off him' when I tried to get past, I don't even feel safe at my own home. But it's going to get better eventually, I'm much happier to be away and deal with people's issues with me which are based on lies. If you're in the same situation as me or you think you're being abused talk to someone you trust and leave them. You've got to prioritise yourself over anyone else, you can't change anyone but yourself so make that change and take time to recover from the abuse, don't ever get back in contact with the abuser and surround yourself by happy, supportive people. Take it one day a time guys and it'll be ok :)",alonely-boi,2019-02-21 05:02:03,0,684,10.2,56.39,85.47,2.51,31.09,12.43,95.32,61.55,25.73,20.47,11.99,0.44,1.9,5.99,0.15,5.26,3.07,11.84,9.21,7.46,9.06,2.19,20.32,4.24,2.19,2.49,1.02,1.17,8.77,3.07,5.7,0.88,2.92,0.88,16.37,0.15,1.46,0,6.58,10.96,2.34,1.32,1.61,2.19,1.61,2.92,2.34,0.44,0.58,1.17,1.17,0.29,0.44,0,0.15,9.36,3.07,1.32,3.07,1.9,1.32,9.8,7.75,1.17,17.69,4.24,7.31,7.46,0.29,0.44,0.58,0.15,0,0.58,0.58,0,0.29,0.29,0,0,13.89,2.92,5.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.97,0,0.15

Don't debate, don't argue, don't try and change my mind. It doesn't need it and it won't change. 

October 4th. We are arguing, alot of things have been bothering me for a real long while about you feeling controlling and manipulated  and my trust was falling  with you after you lied to me for months and months about what happened with you and your ex girl and not just fibbed but went out of your way to prove it. Along with you putting your hands around my throat before when we were arguing. 
October 5 wake up and you dip off . And not just to start your truck like usual but to leave. Felt like you were just trying to hurt me like you felt I hurt you...but I was never trying to hurt you when I left with out saying goodbye...you were using it as payback for when  I didn't it felt. I was just running late and wasn't use to having to drive an extra 13 mins from the apartment instead of the house...( I know it's not much but for me in the morning every second counted).
So I'm sorry if I bothered you when I got up and went out there. I was alittle hurt tho. That you would do that and wasn't expecting it. So it rubbed me the wrong way and made me more and more heated through the day. Already had many time where I felt scared of you...like my instincts were telling me to be scared of you..You could and would hurt me..so yeah was definitely scared that day as well. And kept the door locked in the second bedroom  when u got home but like I said I was  getting more and more heated and wanted you to know I was seriously mad so i started grabbing my stuff...and instead of you trying to gentally stop me or leave me be like I some how expected..Instead you started getting mad at me again...so I walked to the other room and closed and locked the door.  So I could be alone and stop the yelling...I wasn't expecting for the door to break in front of me...but as soon as it did adranalin started pulling. I was worried. Scared. Surprised...felt backed in a corner...And like you wouldn't care if I got hurt..knowing what you did to your ex and previous things with us.  so I tested it...I got up and pushed u..but...u  pushed back hard as hell...way harder then u needed to...telling me "" If you wanna act like a man, I'll treat  you like one  if that's what you want"" ...like you never cared.  I was as good as a stranger on the street . U could give a shit less what happened to me...and unfortunately I didn't fully believe it at the time...but you didn't care..which soon I  shortly found out..the hard way. I felt my self fall all the way back and stumble over the twin bed...astonished and hurt I tried again...see if u would do what you did again...and you did...harder and harder but with your fists.. this time you wanted me to hurt. You wanted me to be treated like a punching bag. You didn't care it hurt me. You  wanted me to stop and chose the worse way to end it and after I'd already gotten those bruises across the chest at this point I was afraid what you would do..if this would keep happening...how u could do that to someone you ""loved"" and...that's when I chose to get the phone out when you left the room...I wasn't planning on sharing it less I needed it but I was truly afraid...and seeing how smooth you are about lieing and how u got away with the other DV case...I was a afraid you'd end up repeatedly hurting me after you already showed multiple signs of abusive personality..so I downloaded a recording app...And hit record went in there and thought maybe...maybe I could get some evidence...not knowing I had plenty on my chest from how hard you already hit me that day and walked timidly with a front on into the bedroom but you quickly realized what I was doing...trying to take MY phone away from me. Like a child being punished. I wasn't gonna let it happen so I fought as hard as I could for it but we wrestled down the hallway. With me on the bottom the entire time. Yes, I tried to pinch your balls...tried to get you off of me everyway I could.  But I couldn't I was to weak..u we're way to strong. You twisted my leg and I knew I couldn't keep going.  You were gonna do anything to make me stop. To keep my phone so I couldn't call for help..and I was getting more scared...there was no way I could protect myself except stop...not realizing that would end up being  worse for me...cause once I though it was finally over, My chest was hurting me, knee felt twisted and in pain...I laid there in forfeet. Already given up and wanted it to be over for only seconds later...my fear was about to turn into my nightmare as you walked around me...and...put your foot to the right bottom side of my back....hard.",StillStandingStrong,2019-02-21 09:33:00,1,941,17.74,45.35,92.27,1.11,23.52,10.63,95.22,63.55,22.32,17.32,10.31,0.53,6.48,0,0,4.99,4.04,14.35,9.46,7.23,10.52,2.76,21.25,5.53,4.25,2.23,0.74,1.91,6.7,1.7,4.99,1.17,1.59,1.38,9.46,0,0.11,0.11,0.11,13.39,2.13,1.59,3.93,2.02,0.85,4.36,4.46,0.32,0.74,3.4,1.38,1.06,0.21,0,0,6.38,0.96,0.96,2.02,1.49,1.06,10.2,5.53,1.38,16.68,2.87,7.55,6.59,0.21,0.21,1.17,0.11,0.11,0,2.44,0.21,1.38,0.21,0.11,0,23.49,19.02,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,2.76,0.43,0
at9s0t,Advice to help a friend,"Hi everyone, 

One of my friends is being abused emotionally by a boyfriend. She had told me about him a while ago and all the horrible things he does (including stalking) and then a few months later went back to him. 

I told her I was here for her with no judgement and that she knows what’s best for herself. But then she wanted me to meet him and kept telling me how great the future was going to be. I was lucky enough to deflect for most of the conversations and not really have to respond. I felt very uncomfortable with the idea of getting to know this man after the things she has told me. 

Well, things have escalated again (like I knew they would) and I have done my best to remain free from judgment. I listened to her talk it through and offered support as she cut contact with him. But as the days went on, she kept going back to checking his social media and try to rationalize his behavior and I ended up letting my feelings of frustration show. I ended up trying to give advice and kept getting frustrated when she just wouldn’t listen to me. It started taking a toll on my mental health and I wasn’t sleeping well and my anxiety was through the roof. I also realized that while I wanted to offer support, I am clearly not qualified to offer advice. And additionally, offering advice/telling them what they should do is the last thing someone needs because it takes away their agency.

As a result, I have backed off and set boundaries in the situation for my own mental health, but she hasn’t talked to me in days. I feel like she is mad at me because she is now confiding in another friend of ours (and kind of made a comment about her being supportive while I was in the room). but I don’t want to add to her plate by trying to talk through our friendship. 

I have never been in her situation before and while rationally I know not to judge, my emotions are starting to come out and I just am so frustrated at the whole situation (not her- I know she is going through a lot). 

Has anyone been the “friend” in this situation? How did you balance your own mental health with your friends need for support?

Also do you think I should attempt to reach out to say I’m sorry for handling the situation wrong? Or should I just wait it out for a bit until she is feeling better about the situation over all? 


Thank you for any advice.",mariqueen,2019-02-21 15:01:24,0,453,41.22,70.96,28.88,33.38,19.7,15.45,93.38,63.8,20.75,16.78,8.39,0.44,1.1,5.96,0.88,3.97,5.08,17,9.27,5.08,8.83,2.21,21.19,4.86,2.65,1.1,0.22,2.21,5.52,2.87,2.43,0.66,1.1,0.22,17.22,0,1.55,4.42,1.99,12.58,3.09,1.77,2.21,2.43,1.1,2.65,1.77,0.22,0.66,0.88,0.88,0.22,0.66,0,0,7.28,3.09,1.32,1.77,2.21,0.22,6.84,10.82,1.32,11.7,1.55,4.64,5.96,0.44,0,0.22,0.22,0,0,0.44,0,0,0,0.44,0,10.6,3.97,1.77,0,0,0.88,0,0.22,0.44,1.32,1.77,0.22

atbitv,It seems like I can never 100% move on,"So, after almost five years of thriving BAM I was sucked back into my past with my ex. I applied for a job and was provided with a job offer, during the background check it came back that I had been charged with simple assault. They asked for my explanation. 

I’m in tears, this was because when I was eight months pregnant my ex tried to kill me and my son. Then he called the cops to another address and said that I picked him up and threw him
in a pond and proceeded to assault him. He then went to the magistrates office and official papers were completed. The cops showed up and saw that I was injured, and pregnant and the process to dispose the charge was started and completed in 9 days. However on my background check it shows not guilty. I also have papers showing that he fled and was not able to be found and arrested for the assault with a deadly weapon until two months later. He was the convicted and we received a restraining order. 

I sent a long detailed explanation and had to stop many times to cry. Not only is this brought up again but now I’ll likely lose my job offer.

I’m just venting I guess.

atboyk,"Normal to be numb months after leaving an abuser? And, wait, did I just justify my own attempted murder?","Well, as all romantic, doomed from the beginning stories start, I met my (now) ex during my sophomore year in high school. I was immediately enamored with this boy; intellectual and witty, gentle and masculine, he possessed and radiated every quality I could ever dream of.... come to find out that was planned years later. 

But, as the story goes on, we dated throughout the remainder of my sophomore, his junior year. My parents were off and on out of the picture, so I had developed a keen knack for partying my pain with a large group of guys and girls. My new partner despised every single one of my friends, and, slowly but surely, isolated me from every one of them, leading me to block all of their telephone numbers. Moving into my senior year, my ex had convinced me that make-up was a trait of the slutty and the desperate. (So, there goes all my makeup and clothes that expressed my personal sense of style) Next to go was my social media. Now, I would defend tooth and nail that all of these major, dramatic life changes were from me, but any of you with experience with a narcissist will understand that it was not. 

All of this leads up to me graduating high school with a phenomenal scholarship opportunity to go to a private university in our home town for free. My partner, of course, could not fathom the idea of me being allowed to go to such an institution, because I was a “former whore,” so of course I cannot he trusted because I may return to my whoring ways. 

After telling my father of my choice to not go to college, a brawl ensues, which I completely understand now. However, I swore the man out of my life, and moved in with my partner the very next day. 

Fast forwarding once again, my partner and I, now together for three years, are living in a dingy apartment in a very poor area of town. My partner gets the itch to start experimenting with LSD, and with some hesitation and lots of research, I’m in, and after our first trip together, he is DETERMINED that I have been cheating on him our entire relationship. (Majorly false, I not so much as looked in another mans direction, let alone actually cheated on who I thought was my soulmate) 

Since I am a “cheater,” my now psycho-naut partner tells me that I have to “learn”... learning being a year of mental, heavily physical, sexual, and constant emotional abuse. Here’s the highlights, lol, for times sake: 

-my partner stopped working, so I was then working    55+ hours a week to pay every bill, piece of food, substance, kitty food, literally everything. 

-my partner attempted to strangle me 5 times, three of which resulted in me losing consciousness 

-from January 2018-November 2018, I slept in our bed less than 15 times, I was either sleeping upstairs on the floor, in my car, or if I “was a good Kathryn” I was allowed to sleep on the floor under my partner by our bed.

-I would wake up to my partner taking advantage of me constantly 

-My partner punched through a wooden door to get to me (literally obliterated the door and my face, resulting in me passing out from being hit in the head so many times) 

-my partner poured RUBBING ALCOHOL in my mouth, eyes, ears, nose, and all over my head when I tried to defend myself from him one time. 

-my partner gave me countless black eyes, busted lips, and bruises allllllll over my body. 

-my partner whipped me with a belt where the metal belt buckle was making contact with my skin. 

-my partner lied about childhood abuse he endured, he made up stories that mimicked what I have gone through

All in all, of course he is a piece of garbage, but I still find myself making excuses for him, telling myself that it wasn’t that bad? I now have such a skewed view of our relationship that I feel like everything is my fault and that I asked for it from being crazy (but a normal) high schooler when we first got together. I have a 5 year Protective Order against him, but I still have the urge to call him and run right back to him daily. Even though he tried to kill me multiple times, despite him verbally assaulting me daily, looking past every lie he told me about himself, I’m still in love with my abuser. 

I know this is so annoyingly long, and I am so sorry for that! If you’ve made it this far, I would really appreciate your two-cents on the matter or if you have any words of advice. Hoping I’m just still under his influence and my sub-conscious mind will catch up soon, so I can file him away as an abusive, manipulative narcissist, not my soulmate like I still believe.",kholl_,2019-02-21 18:08:19,6,859,60.49,35.03,94.75,9.86,27.71,17.93,91.15,55.06,18.98,15.6,11.76,0.93,0.47,2.21,0.23,3.38,4.77,15.6,6.17,5.36,6.29,0.81,13.39,4.54,1.63,0.81,1.86,3.26,5.82,2.21,3.49,0.23,1.51,0.58,10.59,0.23,2.33,0.12,2.79,10.83,2.21,2.1,1.05,1.4,2.21,3.03,1.98,0.81,0.23,0.58,3.61,2.1,0.81,0.35,0.47,10.48,4.42,1.86,2.79,0.81,1.16,4.42,5.82,0.7,17,2.56,6.98,7.92,2.68,0.7,0.7,0.7,0.12,0.23,0.7,0.23,0.12,0,0.12,0,17.46,3.73,8.5,0.12,0.12,0.35,0.12,1.63,0.93,0.7,1.16,0.12
atc5tj,Need advice after a couple bad days,"Today’s been a really rough day. I saw my abusive ex boyfriend last night at a gas station. I was so scared I hid in my car until he left. Something took over me and I couldn’t move, it was the first time I’ve saw him since I called the cops on him in December.

Then today someone felt the need to tell me that they heard he had a new girlfriend. Him moving in before me was expected but it kinda hurt a little when I heard that. Not in a jealous way, idk how to explain it .

Today I tried to treat myself and got a completely new hair style and color and felt great! Came home and relaxed and smoked, did my homework and all was good. But all of a sudden it hit me, sobbing uncontrollably and confused and just hurting. All I can think is that I am someone with so so much love to give... why didn’t he love me the same way back or why is it that I have all this love and truly mean it but he can find someone to quickly. He’s a sex addict among any different mental disorders.... but I just expect something different. I also didn’t expect to feel this way.

I’m just looking for any sort of advice or kind words. I hate letting him have this power over me but I don’t know how to not let him have it.",prettylilthrowaway4,2019-02-21 18:55:37,5,252,13.32,21.36,89.63,19.82,14,10.71,97.22,59.52,22.62,15.08,10.71,0,0,3.97,0.4,7.54,5.16,9.52,9.13,6.35,10.32,2.78,19.44,5.16,1.98,1.98,0.4,3.17,7.54,3.57,3.97,1.19,1.19,1.19,11.11,0,0.79,0,4.37,19.44,3.17,1.98,2.38,4.76,2.38,5.56,4.76,1.59,0.79,2.38,2.38,0,0.4,0.4,0.4,6.75,1.98,0.79,1.59,1.59,0.79,8.33,10.71,1.59,15.48,1.98,5.95,8.33,0.4,0.4,0.79,0,0,0,1.19,0,0.79,0,0,0.4,13.49,8.33,1.59,0,0,0,0.4,0,0,3.17,0,0

atmh9l,I can't figure out how to leave my abusive husband. I cant leave my daughter behind.,"He would love bomb me and then discard me over and over throughout high school. This made me feel that he was somehow above me.
Started seriously dating April 25th 2016
He claimed that we were meant to be, he said I had always been the one.
He wanted to be with me but refused to consider moving to Alabama where I lived, he insisted that I move to North Carolina.
During my first few weeks around him he deleted many of my friends and loved ones from my social media and phone. I moved to NC at the beginning of April When I moved to NC he began criticizing how I dress and my height.
He ignored any boundaries that I tried to set regarding sex or birth control.
He demanded all of my passwords and unlimited access to my phone.
It's important to note here that I was very physically abused as a child and therefore I don't have a great sense of self worth or a great connection to my family.
In May his parents lost their house, Rob made me feel guilty for wanting to leave by sulking over the lose of his childhood home.
His rage became obvious in June 2016.
He would drunkenly accused me of cheating on him weekly, he screamed over me when I tried to speak, he name called, punched walls and tables. He often said that I had no where else to go and no money so I better give him whatever he wanted. He blamed me for his anger. He used gaslighting, and confused me in every argument. I rarely understand what brought on the rage or why it was directed at me.
We got engaged June 24th 2016, he did not buy a ring or get on one knee, he made me feel unworthy. He had me lie to his family about the ring. I felt that it was too early to end the relationship after making such a big commitment in moving to NC. I also wanted to avoid the conflict and rage so I said yes.
I understand now how stupid and naive I was, he is a narcissist and I didn't know anything about narcissistic tactics at the time.
He demanded a joint bank account when I got a job in July 2016, refusing to let me keep my own bank account.
He started saying that he felt suicidal frequently after abusive incidents to make me feel sympathy for him.
He started stopping by my work to go through my car.
He began humiliating me about sex in front of friends. I stopped trying to understand his gaslighting and crazy making behaviour, instead I tried to just give him what he wanted to avoid his anger.
He demanded that I stop taking birth control September 2016, I refused to comply.
He once again claimed that I had no one and no where to go, he said that he would make my life hell until I gave him what he wanted. At this time my name was on a lease with him and I had been isolated from my family and friends.
I gave into his demand for no birth control in December 2016. 
Pregnant January 2017.
The abuse got worse and more frequent while I was pregnant, he began taking my phone and keys away anytime that I was unhappy. He would block the door and scare me by screaming and hitting walls at the same time. He used shame and guilt over the baby to convince me to stay and marry him even though I had wanted to leave on many different occasions.
Married April 15th 2017.
Abuse continued, an obvious cycle formed. Abuse, begged forgiveness, flowers and love letters, tension and passive aggressiveness, then abuse again. 
He would start an argument with insults and name calling then when I would get upset he would calm down and relax then he would point his finger at me and say that I was the one out of control.
He never shows actual remorse or empathy for the pain he causes.
I avoided having friends to avoid being humiliated by him in front of friends.
He would often go into a rage over me being too busy at work to text him back.
Daughter born October 24th 2017 
He was quiet for a couple of months.
I was treated for postpartum depression, until depression subsided in February 2018.
Abuse came back about two months after birth of daughter. He woke her up often by hitting doors, yelling, and cursing at me.
He continued to use fear and intimidation to keep me from leaving the house.
He frequently ignores me when I speak to him.
He started demanding pictures as proof that I was at work.
Beginning of 2018 He was put on depression medication. Nothing changed. His medication was changed multiple times with no obvious affect on abuse. He said that with the right medication he would no longer be abusive.
He acts like I owe him sex. He says that the law allows him to take everything from me including our daughter if I withhold affection.
He wont let me have cash, everything has to be bought with a card that he will track.
Throughout 2018 he began grabbing and pushing me or throwing things when angry.
Near the end of 2018 he began treatment for mood disorder. The abuse continued to advance.
He spent any money that I tried to save.
In 2018 he also started showing rage towards our daughter and pinning our daughter down when she woke up in the night with a dirty diaper. He started angrily jerking her around if she moved in bed. He would also get angry with her when she cried in hunger because he didn't want to get her a bottle or food. Several times I stopped him while he forced a pacifier into our daughter's mouth.
He continues to accuse me of cheating on him with my coworkers.
He made it so miserable for me to work that I no longer wanted to do well at work. I felt that I was not worthy of a good job.
He often says that I'd never see my daughter again if I leave.
Beginning of 2019 he pushed me down onto the bed and got ontop of me to hit me and then stopped, the next day he jerked the steering wheel and threatened to kill us all.
I started educating myself on domestic violence. I called the domestic violence hotline which lead me to a court advocate in my area.
I began recording proof of abuse so that I can protect my daughter and myself. I no longer believe that it can get better.
February 15th 2019 I went to a court advocate at the PD to start a protection order. I was told that I had a strong case but could not move out of state with my daughter with the temporary custody from a protection order. I had no where to go in NC so I didn't file for a protection order. I could have gotten him removed from the home, but I have no job or money of my own, I spoke to legal aid who said that my case was not extreme enough for me to qualify for a free custody attorney. I also have no family in NC to help babysit and no idea how long it could take or how much it would cost to get an attorney and custody order.",byrd_liz,2019-02-22 12:35:59,14,1277,47.21,54.37,49.91,1,16.16,16.52,91.31,56.07,21.22,17.78,9.4,0.55,0,7.75,0.08,3.45,4.15,14.57,5.64,4.78,6.89,2.11,16.68,2.82,1.17,1.88,1.8,1.02,6.89,1.41,5.4,1.25,2.9,0.78,14.33,1.64,0.47,1.33,7.28,10.26,1.57,2.43,2.11,1.96,1.17,2.19,2.9,0.31,1.72,0.78,1.64,0.23,0.7,0.39,0.23,9.79,2.27,1.49,3.6,1.72,1.25,8.3,6.03,0.63,17.7,2.51,6.73,8.38,1.25,0.55,1.17,1.25,0.08,0.16,0.23,0.08,0,0.08,0.08,0,8.93,6.19,2.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.63,0,0

atq94d,URGENT- NEED ADVICE-a family friend is in grave danger,"I just found out that my family friend has been getting beaten violently by her husband of 10-11 years (I think) -- since they've been together \[since they were 18/19, now they are in their 30s\]. Her husband has a history of serious domestic voice in his extended family. I found out because two weeks ago she had a major altercation with him where he choked her and left her entire neck bruised. After it happened she frantically texted her siblings and one of them arrived at the front door. Eventually the siblings told her parents and her parents ended up telling my parents. Her parents texted her telling her to leave him immediately and she agreed to but then wouldn't leave the apartment a few nights later when she planned to (they waited outside), saying that she needed to figure out her own way to escape. She did, however, tell her husband that her siblings know of his abuse now. As of right now, I know that her parents have not slept a wink in the past 2 weeks in fear of their daughter being murdered. This is the only info that I know of. I don't know what has been communicated within their family (parents and siblings). 

&amp;#x200B;

He had me in a chokehold last night.
He beat me 3x this week.

I hate him.
He says I dont care.
I spent $8k caring, in a year.

He says he needs someone who isnt going to say she hates him.  Who is going to help him break his feedback loop.  I went to hell and back a million times to try to make it all okay.

He shits on every exhausting effort I made like a fool.  Every time I stutter from the beatings.  Every time I woke up at 4 am from flashbacks.  Every time he choked me or beat my head driving or called me a cunt for hiding in a ball on the bathroom floor.

I dont want to go home.  He will not be there.  I will lay and hate myself and him and hurt and smell the festering wreck he lefy behind.  And is deleting from the history books.  The story is I am all bad.

au3iuh,What my father did last year,"I’m 14 5’11 150lbs and a bit muscular. My father isn’t the worst guy in the world but he’s pretty bad. This story takes place December 12, 2018 (or last year for 2019 readers). So there’s some context to this story: my father burned my brothers paraphernalia for pot mainly and some tobacco of his, which prob costed over $500. This pissed my brother off so he took $200 dollars from my dad but gave it back after knowing it was Christmas money. He kept maybe less than 40% of the money but my dad was still irritated. Anyways on the 12th of December I was told my nephew was being born in the hospital. I was anxious for that reason already so that “fixed” this day. My brother got into an argument with his/my father which turned into an altercation. After that he came in and barged into my room
M=me D=my dad
D: Get ready for school and make it quick the cops are coming. 
M: *under breath* gee I wonder why. 
D: Excuse you?!?
M: I said gee I wonder why
D: Big mistake boy give me your phone or els...
M: NO!
D: Okay, I’ll be waiting downstairs (I lived in a room in the attic) 
M: Okay
I went downstairs cause I had to take my medication and he was downstairs next to the bathroom and kitchen.
D: Ya ready to give me your phone, jackass? 
M: No and respect me when you’re speaking to me
He grabbed me by my shirt and slammed me against the fridge. 
D: The fuck you just say to me boy? 
M: Respect me when you speak to me. 
He punched my rib
D: How’s that for respect?
M: Oh the cops will love this
D: Give me your phone. 
M: No!
D: Go to the living room (next to where I was) 
M: Okay
I turned around but when I did, he tackled me to the ground and started punching and kneeing me
D: GIVE ME YOUR PHONE MOTHERFUCKER!
M: No get off this hurts
D: That’s the point retard. 
I have no mental issues just anxiety and depression. He began choking my but I head butted him and he rolled off of me. I sprinted into the bathroom and locked the door. I texted my mother frantically and opened the door to attempt an escape. He was pushing me into my step sister’s room and threw me to the ground and kicked the rib he punched. 
M: Stop please I’ll give you my phone. 
D: I don’t want your phone, I want you in pain little shit. 
He kneed my back and ribs until I could move and breath for a minute. There was a knock at the door. I packed a bag as he told me to because “we were going somewhere and I needed an overnight bag”
PO=Police Officer EMT=EMT (duh)
PO: Thomas Spano open your door
I got up and went to the door. 
D: Go back to the room
PO: Is that your son? 
M: Yes please come in
D: No we’ll come out. 
We walked out of the house and I went to the EMT
EMT: State your name
M: &amp;()/@:/“
EMT: Okay 
She examined me and I had difficulties breathing and walking but I lied to them and said “no” to protect my dad. To this day I’m living at my mother’s for now I’ll update on this topic if anything comes up

au79ca,Do you ever question your own sanity?,"It's been a couple of weeks, but some of these bruises are being stubborn and are still here. Fingerprint bruises on my arms, some bigger ones on other locations. I went for a massage several days ago and the guy kept asking me about them so I didn't respond one way or the other. 

My head still has a scab which is annoying me, but thankfully the headache is finally gone and I'm feeling pretty much back to normal again. What I don't get is that when I asked for an apology he refused to give one. He tried to say that he would never do that, yet he's done it more times than I can count and I have the marks to prove it. I told him that I'm not going to be quiet anymore. It seems like divorce is in my future, but I am never going to be quiet again.

aucx6s,"My [22F] ex [22M] choked me, trashed my room, got arrested, and is now out on bail threatening to ruin my life","TL;DR: For the past couple of months, I've been staying in a verbally abusive--and sometimes physically violent--relationship because I thought I could fix it. I made a post about this relationship earlier and redditors highly encouraged me to leave, and not to accept any of his advances to get back together, but I turned a blind eye. I fucked up by not listening to you guys. I genuinely loved him and wanted to help fix our relationship. After putting up with his bullying, and physically aggressive outbursts, I feel emotionally exhausted and used. I cried so many times and for so many nights trying to understand how I could have made things better, but at this point, I don't have the energy to keep thinking about it.

Recently, we got into a public argument that escalated to him shoving me up against walls in public, entering my room, and destroying property (e.g., he threw my laptop outside the sidewalk, broke picture frames, lamps, a bookshelf, and only recently I found that he had damaged the flooring). He then choked me and shoved me against walls during this incident. I've only started to develop bruises a few days after the event.

Our history: We'd been dating or had known each other for roughly 8 months. When we first met, he said it was love at first sight for him. We had a whirlwind romance, wherein I tried to discourage his advances. I really just was not ready to date, and emphasized that this was the truth and that I was not trying to play hard to get. He pushed forward anyways. He wanted our relationship to move quickly, and really emphasized that he wanted it to be publicly known that we were dating after a few weeks. I was very uncomfortable with this idea. However, I conceded because he said it would make him feel secure.

During the early stages of the relationship, I was seeing other people and he found out about this and got angry. During the same time, I had found out he had been meeting up and seeing his ex--I was suspicious about this but I gave him the benefit of the doubt to not question it further and decided to forgive him. He told me would never have told me about this had I not found out myself. Seeing as we had both fucked up, he reached out a couple weeks after our break up and wanted to get back together. I agreed to talk it over with him and met up with him--during this conversation he said he sincerely loved me and wanted to change. He made a promise that he was over it, and that he wouldn't do XYZ. I was skeptical, but I wanted to take a chance in loving him again so I agreed.

Ever since we had gotten back together, he became abusive. He would always reference my mistake and call me denigrating names and told me I could never bring up when I felt sad about our relationship because I deserved it. All the while, I tried never to bring up his past fuck ups and never--till this day--called him anything besides his name. He then told me he would not touch another girl, but during some time in the relationship, I saw a snapchat of him basically doing what he told me not to do--hugging another girl at a party. When I confronted him about this, I told him I was not OK with the fact that he expected me not to do certain things while he himself goes and does it. He then proceeded to tell me to shut up because what I did was worse. I turned another blind eye and forgave him for this.

Sometime during the mid-months of our relationship, he saw a notification on my phone for a dating app for an update that I had not deleted. I have a lot of apps on my phone and genuinely had forgotten to delete this. I told him this, and he freaked out. Stormed out of my room, and when we went to my school. He freaked out in public, yelling at me before walking home back to my room. During this, he said he no longer loved me, called me horrible names, and said he had no respect for me. I was so scared that I came home and refused to stay in the same room as him. He later tried apologizing for his behaviour but I said I would consider his apology.

He then asked if it were better if he left that night , and I replied that he should go. Then, he said he couldn't leave because his ride would come in the morning and asked if he could stay the night. I said he could but only if he slept on the floor until he got his ride in the morning. In the middle of the night, he abruptly got up and took the watch he gave my for my birthday and stormed out of the house. I went to use the washroom later that night and I saw him come back inside, and he apologized saying something like, ""Sorry, I wanted to go to McDonalds and sleep but it was raining."" The whole night when he came back into my room, he kept apologizing and asking me to take him back. I forgave him, because I loved him and wanted to make it work.

Later, in December, we went on vacation together. During the vacation, I started to feel a bit sad about the way he was treating me, our past fights, and how I felt that he was using me as a figurative punching bag for whatever reason--e.g., how he would always put me down. He got mad and told me I deserve to feel that way and proceeded to give me the silent treatment. I told him I'd be patient with him and that when he wanted to talk, he could reach out to me. Instead, while we were touring the city, he abruptly abandoned me in the middle of the foreign city and proceeded to do his own thing. He had the keys to our Airbnb so I called him to ask for it back. He started arguing with me, and when I managed to get back to the Airbnb, we discussed breaking up. I told him I just couldn't do it anymore. During the whole ride back to our hometown, he ignored me and then would later warm up to me.

Then, over the holidays, I had broken up with him. I couldn't take it anymore, and he began apologizing. He started telling me that he would change and that he was apologetic for his behavior--that we had both fucked up in the relationship and that we could fix it again. I merely said I would consider the option again. Then, during the this period, I found out that he had made a fake Instagram account to stalk me and my friends. He used this Instagram account to like pictures of scantily clad girls (which I don't care about), but I found this hypocritical because he blew up on me one time when I simply liked a picture of a guy friend online???? He then told me that me doing so was embarrassing and insulting to him. All the while he was doing the same, but just behind my back, and honestly, I don't care.

Anyways, during this break up, I saw another guy. Fast forward to this past week, he found out I saw this guy and got mad at me. He then proceeded to start an argument with me in public. He threw a drink at the window and yelled at me when I tried calm him down. He threw me against walls of buildings as we walked home. When he got to my room, he broke my stuff, assaulted me, and caused my roommate in the other room to consider calling the police. He then made threats to me saying that he'd ""dedicate the rest of \[his\] life to ruining \[mine\]."" He left.

He came back a few minutes later yelling at my roommate cause he apparently forgot more of his things. During this time, he took back the watch he gave me again for my birthday, and a bag he had bought me. At this point, the cops were called and they arrested him. During the time in between, he send nudes of me to my family members. He spent two nights in jail, and is currently out on bail. He's been charged with domestic assault, mischief, and sending intimate photos without consent. Furthermore, now a few days after the incident, I have bruises on my legs, hand, and collar bones that have only recently appeared and it will probably be too late at this point to credibly report this to the cops.

I don't know how I can move on from this in a healthy way. I loved him and cared about him, and I thought he loved me as well. He said he would move on but just didn't. I only wanted the best for both of us so I stayed. Even now, I still only wish him the best. I feel broken and lost. I invested a lot of time, emotion, and love for someone who eventually ended up doing this. I am distraught that it even got to this point and in the meantime I'm awaiting the date for his indefinite trial.",throwawaythebadstuf1,2019-02-24 13:38:10,0,1626,33.13,69.96,65.75,19.35,18.69,14.82,95.08,61.99,24.97,19.13,9.41,1.48,0.06,8.12,0.06,5.84,5.1,14.21,6.27,5.17,8.3,1.66,18.39,3.38,2.09,1.17,0.31,1.6,5.97,2.71,3.14,0.55,1.54,0.68,17.53,0.06,0.62,0.18,8.36,10.64,2.4,1.72,2.52,1.54,0.8,2.4,3.08,1.23,1.17,0.68,1.91,0.49,0.62,0.31,0.06,8.98,4.06,0.98,2.71,1.6,0.31,10.7,5.04,0.98,19.86,3.08,8.43,9.59,0.62,0.74,1.05,0.31,0,0,0.98,0.37,0.25,0.06,0.06,0.12,14.82,5.47,5.54,0.12,0.06,0.25,0,1.17,0.25,0.98,0.25,0.74
aue126,My [22F] ex [22M] has threatened to harm me and I'm not sure how to protect myself?,"## 

TL;DR: I dated a guy for 8 months who developed an instant obsession with me. Things got sour quickly and we've had multiple break ups wherein he has tried to guilt trip me into staying. Has also been verbally abusive and physically aggressive when fighting. Recently assaulted me and got arrested, but is now out on bail trying to make real his threat of ""dedicating \[his\] life to ruin \[mine\]."" I've distanced myself online and offline and I'm not sure how I can move on from this healthily and how else to protect myself.

It got sour early on and we ended up breaking up for the first time. He then asked to get back together a few weeks later by saying that he'd change. I decided to give it another chance since I thought that things might be different. It didn't. I found out he had been lying to me about seeing his ex in summer, has been cyberstalking me, and gets mad over me liking pictures of guy friends on Instagram. He has also gotten in the habit of calling me explicit names, often unprovoked.

I've broken up with him frequently during this duration but he has always tried to guilt trip me into staying, and promising that things will change. Our relationship up until now has been verbally abusive; as well, I've had to tolerate his random physically aggressive outbursts in order to ensure my safety in some situations.

Recently, he assaulted me (note: he choked me and pushed me up against walls specifically) and got arrested. He got charged with assault, along with mischief and sending intimate photos without consent. Between his arrest, he ended up sending intimate photos of me to my family members. He's out on bail currently and seems to want to make do with his threats to harm me so I've been told. I've done everything I can to distance myself from him--online and offline.

auegvf,Abusive long term boyfriend,"Ive posted this before on another sub, but figured I might get more advice here on how to get out of this. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 11 years, and the last 2 years have been absolute hell. He started off just controlling; something that should have been my warning sign. Then it turned into emotional abuse and now, physical abuse. Everyday I hear that I’m a stupid, dumb b**** who is worthless. I have been trying SO hard to keep up with his standards, but it seems like every morning it starts again. I’ve been waking up with him early (4:30)  and start working nonstop, but then I hear about how much I’m not doing. 

I remember when the physical abuse started. He pushed me so hard I fell. Then he started slapping me, pinching me, kicking me, punching me. I don’t remember the last time I was bruise free. It has been daily, even though it’s just been slapping the past week (I know, it’s not just slapping.... compared to everything else I have endured, this is nothing). My hair is so thin because he’s pulled it all out. I’m literally on the verge of just wanting to die constantly. My family is hundreds of miles away, and no matter how many times I have tried to end it.. there’s always an excuse. Not on my end, but his. I have absolutely no resources to fall back on because everyone I know is so far away. 

I’m constantly fearing going home after every work day, and have incredible anxiety (which I am forced to hide due to fear of being hurt) every weekend. Part of the issue is not doing enough with him (going out, hiking, fun activities) but I am so afraid of getting hurt and making him angry  that I don’t want to do anything with him anymore.

I’m just at a complete loss of what to do at this point. I’ve tried to end our relationship so many times, but I’m always talked back into making things better. Which is why I thought getting this off of my chest might be helpful. I have not told anyone at all, so it feels a bit nice to get it out.",seatosea04,2019-02-24 16:08:45,8,381,12.57,16.57,96.32,1,14.65,14.7,94.23,60.89,21.26,13.12,10.24,0.26,0,2.62,0,8.14,2.62,13.12,13.39,7.87,7.61,2.62,23.62,6.3,1.57,2.36,1.31,3.15,6.04,1.31,4.72,1.05,2.1,1.05,6.82,0.26,0.52,0,3.15,14.44,2.1,2.62,0.79,2.1,3.67,3.41,1.84,0,0.52,1.31,0.79,0.26,0.52,0,0,6.56,1.57,1.84,1.31,1.57,0.79,5.51,13.91,1.84,19.42,2.1,7.35,10.5,0.79,1.05,0.52,0.26,0.26,0.26,1.05,0.52,0.26,0.26,0,0,20.21,7.61,4.99,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,3.94,2.1,1.05

augta8,Is this domestic violence? My boyfriend and I got into a fight and I couldn't go to school the next day.,"I recently got into a fight with my boyfriend over the phone.

He had said a sarcastic joke about nasty things I did in the past and I didn't like it, and when I said so, he got very defensive and angry.

Then I told him that we can't make this relationship work if I can't say my concerns about our relationships without you getting angry at me.

I was calm when talking to him, but he started to say nasty things about what I did in the past. I basically cheated on him, but we weren't technically in a relationship at the time. I've already acknowledged multiple times that I cannot repay him for what I had done. I've apologised many times but I know it's not enough. I'm a completely different person now and I'm very committed to the relationship. I've been doing so much for him out of love, and he seems to know that too. But he told me that he his constantly reminded of the past and gets mad about it every so often.

I'm not doing anything that reminds him of what I did in the past, but yet he still brings it up frequently and even makes sarcastic jokes about it.

So the whole argument, what started with ""I think we should work on having good communication in this relationship"", ended with ""You were a scumbag. You've changed after you dated (ex boyfriend). Even your friend said so."" It went to a completely different topic. (I don't know if scumbag is the right word, but he said something along the lines of that in Japanese)

He then proceeded to threaten me by saying that he'd tell his friends. Now, he's known for doing this. When he gets into an argument with me, he goes straight to his friends, tells them everything and tries to get them on his side. It feels like he just wants to paint me as the bad guy. Why would he go around telling his friends all the bad things about me? Does he want them to hate me or something? If he really liked me, he wouldn't do that would he? The thing is, I don't like to talk openly about our relationship to ANYONE. I don't tell anyone that we got into a fight because I don't want to drag other people into our business. Then he continued to say that all of his friends knew what I had done in the past. He brought up the names of his friends. What the fuck is he trying to accomplish? I thought.

So after that I got really mad and I literally said everything I had to say (not in a rude manner of course.) I said things like:

\- Please stop talking about my past. I'm not doing anything now that makes you think of the past. If you can't forget the past, how are we going to keep this relationship stable?

\- You need to stop getting so defensive when I talk about my concerns. (I pointed out that this was a form of verbal abuse but that just made him even more angry...)",milkiwi,2019-02-24 20:17:12,16,547,14.98,72.07,47.72,1.78,15.19,13.89,96.34,66.18,27.42,18.83,8.78,1.46,1.46,6.58,0.55,8.59,5.48,13.89,8.78,8.23,7.31,3.11,20.66,2.93,1.65,2.19,0,1.46,6.22,1.65,4.57,0.18,3.66,0,20.11,0,1.83,0,7.31,13.16,2.01,1.46,2.38,2.56,1.46,5.12,2.38,0,2.19,0.18,0.37,0,0,0.18,0,9.87,4.75,1.1,1.28,2.01,0.91,8.78,11.7,0.91,13.71,1.46,4.94,7.31,1.1,0.37,0.18,0.18,0,0,0.37,0.18,0,0,0,0,17.18,5.85,2.74,0.18,0,1.1,0,0.37,0.73,4.39,1.46,0.37

He came over and pressured me into preforming oral sex. I do regret it a lot, it’s my fault I shouldn’t have been so gullible. Anyways, he ended up choking me, as in the kink. But then he got frustrated because this was before the oral. He kept choking me and at a point he choked me so hard I thought I was going to die. 
I don’t know what to think of this situation so I came on here for feedback, if I’m over thinking it.

aurqex,Am I the abuser?,"Please help me sort this out. I \[F\] am feeling very badly about a truly terrible and volatile fight with \[M\] partner. I know that what he did is not acceptable but I am struggling with assessing my role in it and with the guilt that I pushed him to it.  


It started small, as we are getting ready for bed. We had a disagreement about something related to my feelings about my family. Partner disagrees that I should feel the way I feel. I protest and try to explain why I feel the way I feel. We don't get anywhere. He shuts down the conversation (as in ""we're done with this""), which he often does and which I had just asked him to stop doing that very day (and have many, many times previously). I press him. He is condescending and acts as if me wanting to continue talking is very annoying. This is common, and when he used to do it, I would just melt into an emotional puddle, but in more recent iterations of this pattern, I don't let his tone deter me from being heard and I press my case and tell him he can't just shut me off so rudely. It's stupid, really, because it never achieves the desired outcome, but I am tired of him unilaterally ending discussions.   


I continue talking, with a raised voice. He tells me to stop yelling. I tell him I'm not yelling. I do not believe that I'm yelling, Just speaking with an elevated voice -- not normal level, not yelling, but in-between -- like the tone you'd use to talk over someone else who's talking, but not yelling at them. He often tells me to stop yelling when I'm not. I'm just getting really frustrated and mad at this point and he tells me to go away. I won't stop talking/defending myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

He gets up and leaves the room. I follow him and continue. At this point he starts calling me names. I call him names back. Honestly, my memory gets fuzzy at this point because it was all so emotional. I'm crying. He makes fun of me for crying. I'm angry but I also just want it all to stop so I reach out to hug him and hug him (we're next to each other on a bed). I just hold on to him as much as I can and ask him to stop being so mean (he's calling me names I've asked him explicitly, many times before, to stop using). There is part of me that is being an asshole because I won't let him go even though he doesn't want to be touched. I don't remember my exact frame of mind but it was probably a mixture of anger and desperation. He reacts very aggressively to me invading his space and starts shoving me off of him and trying to push me off the bed. We basically wrestle. We are insulting each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever he says to me, I turn it back on him. He holds me down and covers my mouth at one point and tells me to stop talking. I don't know why I wasn't scared, maybe adrenaline, but he leaves the room and I follow again and just keep trying to put my arms around him, trying to get him to stop. He grabs my arm and deliberately hurts me by scratching me (I have scrapes and bruises now). I finally backed off when he told me that he hates me and that he would kill me if I didn't leave him alone. We slept in separate rooms.

  
I was completely floored and angry with him (and scared of him) when this happened, but now I am increasingly ashamed of my behavior. We had a fight of this magnitude about a year ago, but not to this level of physical escalation. We went to therapy for a while after it. I know I shouldn't have pursued him the way that I did. I have apologized several times in the last day for not respecting his boundaries. He has not apologized to me and, in fact, won't talk to me now. He asked for space. I have checked with him twice in the last 36 hours about how long it will be before I can talk to him. He is angry still. He also angrily showed me a place where I had scratched him and told me to continue leaving him alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a completely terrible person. I am beginning to feel that I am the one who abused him. Please give me your honest assessments. Obviously our relationship is dysfunctional. I am trying to understand how to fix myself.

av0b5x,Wrongly accused - old guy seeking advice,"I am sure someone else has been through this and I am looking for some advice.

ME: 60 y.o., retired, married 3 months. I was recently arrested and charged with domestic violence. She self inflicted a facial wound with a pair of boots.

During a heated argument, she became physical (3rd time during this marriage) she slapped me in the face, which she admitted doing to the cops. I told her I was calling the police and I stepped in the garage for a smoke and waited for the police. I told the dispatcher she slapped me, and said to stay away from her. I did just that, and she was completely out of my sight. 

When the police arrived I stepped out of the garage and met them at the front door. They asked is that your wife, and I looked past the cops and saw my wife standing at an ambulance. I explained my story to the police however they were convinced I struck her and I was arrested.

I do have a lawyer, his advice is to avoid trial and perhaps plead guilty to a lesser charge.

I have a hard time doing this, as God as my witness, I never touched that woman.

I do know she has admitted striking her ex-husband and I also know she has lied about a lot of things in her past. While formatting two laptops for her, I recovered some photos and emails strongly suggesting she was not faithful in the past.

Do I reach out to her ex-husband? Her family? Her friends? I can't talk to her per judge's orders.

As I said, seeking advice from someone that has been through this.

av0mst,The end of love?,"Me and my significant other have been together for three years and the affection from him has always been lacking and the sexual part as well. He’s not very clean, if I don’t wash clothes or sheets it’ll never get done, he’s an alcoholic, he’s depressed all the time and he’s going through gender issues. I tried loving him despite all of these things. 

Everything that I was able to offer him apparently was never good enough for him and I’m super confused because I’m not sure what a person is supposed to give if it’s not themselves. I provided us a fully furnished home, means of transportation, protection of our belongings and our pets and he still says that I do nothing. Last night an argument escalated to the point where the the cops were called because things got badly physical. He is so just unreasonable it got very physical to the point where he was trying to bite through my thumb! Telling me that I’m a piece of shit monster who does nothing and the more I tried to constantly point out the things I’m able to provide alongside not being judgmental or anything of the sort and always accepting him for who he is, I’m not good enough. He just says I’m materialistic and superficial. 

We’ve argued about the same thing for three years, i always ask him if he can work on being affectionate show me more love and  just downright actually being there for me the way he says he wanted to be. He told me that I was disgusting and unworthy of being touched by someone like him. And his reason is because I have such bad anxiety and trust issues and he thinks when I’m bringing up what’s wrong, I’m attacking him. When in truth he’s not meeting me half way at all and I’m tired of being called crazy for asking for something decent in return. 

I post here not for sympathy but to seek understanding of what is really going on! We share a few mutual friends, ( he hates all my friends and family ), we both love gaming and even considered each other their rival to add more fun. He says even in the good moments where there is no problem that I am still disgusting and not worthy of hugs etc...
 We have shared goals, fears everything, but somehow I am unworthy? I’ve attempted to make sure he knows I love him by supporting him and making him feel attractive and just down right being in his fucking corner always! But in the end I was basically irrelevant.

av4wwv,Two victims,"Me and my now boyfriend were both abused by previous partners, I was with mine for 2 years, he was with his for 8, we love eachother fiercely but as a result of our pasts we both still have parts of us that are reflections of our abusers and the scars they left us with.
He doesn't show emotion and i show far too much, when I get angry or annoyed I walk away, I have a lot of trouble dealing with confrontation (obviously) but he seems to thrive on it, today I locked myself in the bathroom because I woke him up for work (he slept all day instead and I don't want him to lose his job so I've been trying to get him out of this rut he's in) after that he proceeded to throw things at me scream shout, being so aggressive, punching things, hitting his head off things, I locked myself in the bathroom because let's be honest its my default setting because in my mind it's gonna happen, all that horrific stuff from years ago is about to happen again, he kicked and punched the door, screaming and screaming, i managed to get my phone and text a friend who gave me the courage to open the door and just sit away from him, which I did, I stay in the bedroom all day, quiet, watching TV, minding my business. He then runs a bath and says he's gonna be in the room the rest of the night and if i dont like it ive to get the fuck out, take my shit etc starting the whole thing up again, and mentally at this point I'm gone, totally shut down, crying, begging him not to be this way that this isn't him and he doesn't need to react that way, that I love him and im not her (his abusive ex) to which he says I'm exactly like her, we are all the same and a bunch of other horrible things to hurt me to my core. I also have mental illness (who knew) ptsd, depression, anxiety. Yesterday I got the implant changed so I'm emotional enough and in enough pain as it is, but now I'm questioning... Everything, I thought by being a good girlfriend, talking to him, comforting him, loving him was teaching him how he should be treated and what a relationship should be like, not like this, not having to hide from him because im terrified, not knowing if it'll escalate beyond this or if he can be helped, if im not enough, it's completely ruined my brain, i have so much empathy and love for this man he has done astonishing things for me but I can't trust my mentally ill mind so what should I do?

He called me every disgusting name he could when things weren't going his way. The silent treatment for days at a time without a given reason to why then blow up at the end of the week. 
I leave him alone like he would ask and got shit for that. I try to talk it out and get shit for that. I cry I am scolded. I don't cry, I'm scolded. I forgot to bring milk home, scolded. I left to go see my mother as planned pryor and he is home sick, scolded for that. I couldn't do anything right! I lost myself and my mind. 
He used everything he knew about me as ammo against me. I'm diagnosed with psychotic depression and he used that every chance he could. "" You're fucking psycho. Take your meds. You can't remember anything. Stop crying all the time you don't even have a reason."" On and on. I've been free of him for over a year now. I have a protective order against him. 
He recently went to jail for warrant on violating my protective order via text and calling. He got released last night. This was his second arrest for it. He never beat me, but I fear him. He has put hands on an ex in the past. He is a violent person. I fear seeing him in public. I fear him showing up at my house. I have nightmares of him trying to break in and steal my daughter (he is merely a sperm donor not a father). 
He hasn't given me real reason for this fear if safety, yet I can't keep the worst out of my head. I've been to therapy and am doing much better, the fear just won't leave me.

His sister told me he cried so hard he couldn't breathe over me. Well because I am seriously addicted to this man I began stalking him on Facebook. We're still friends on there btw although there is a no contact order. And on Instagram I saw him liking the posts of this girl. Like every post ever. He even went back and liked a selfie she posted while he was in jail. So that hurt a lot. He seems obsessed with her. Now I know this is probably very petty of me, but I screenshotted the article of what happened the day I called the police and it is pretty graphic and detailed, has his mugshot.

avhxl4,Verbal abuse and trying to keep my house,"I am the victim of constant, relentless verbal abuse from a man who I am married to for ten years, from whom I am estranged at times, and at times who lives in the house, but we are not separated. My house is both of ours. It's paid off. I am in my 40's. I live in an extremely costly area of the country, one of the most costly. I have no family support other than from his family. We are wealthy due to his family money. Without that, I would not be able to afford living where I do. He also pays for my health care, my son's college, my car insurance, etc. although he's not controlling and I keep my own bank account. He's not controlling in general, just angry, really angry and threatening.  


He is a very psychologically disturbed and sick individual who likes to scream for hours at me. I don't listen to it, but he will scream in my face even if I ignore him, and if I try to leave, he will block my way, sometimes for hours. Beyond that, he is not physically threatening. He blames me for his behavior and refuses to go to therapy.    


I can't ever understand what he's angry about. He just wants to scream and fight. This will not change and has gone on for decades.  


I avoid him.  


I want to really divorce him but am concerned I will lose my house. Since he's not physically violent, is the verbal and psychological abuse considered domestic violence? Or am I likely to lose my home? It's worth $600,000. I also am due to inherit more money from his family, to the tune of several million dollars. I will lose that. My son will lose his ability to go to college as well if I divorce him.   


He doesn't seem to care if I am gone, and I travel alone a lot. But his behavior is literally crazy. He has threatened, for example, to have me fired from my employment on completely false pretenses, he verbally abuses my son, who already suffers some psychological illness, and he does things like walk in the door and say, ""Why aren't you working?"" after I've worked for 15 hours straight in a day, and when I say that, he will say, ""You're useless and never do anything. You don't make enough money for it to matter anyways. You were probably on Facebook all day. The house is disgusting."" He'll say things like this when I have stacks of work in front of me and the house is completely spotless. If I mention this, he'll say I am gaslighting him. If I say nothing, he'll say I am abusive. If I walk out of the room, he will scream and block my way.   


I moved to a hotel a few days ago and want to go home and want him to go away and leave the house to me, at least. I am concerned though about the way he will ruin my son's college career and how I may lose the house or my health insurance. I feel stuck.   


I do occasionally scream at him if he's screamed long enough at me, and then he says I am abusive, because he has abused me for literally hours and hours, and I finally scream at him to go fuck himself or whatever. I sometimes record him to get him to stop.   


If we get divorced, will I lose everything? I feel like I can't stay in this situation, but I have for ten years, and it started about seven years ago and has been consistent since. I suspect he's mentally ill. He's also very, very intelligent; he is a professor. He comes across as upstanding.

avjznp,What would keep you from talking about a sexual assault you experienced?,"Hello Redditors,

I am writing a paper on what barriers prevent female victims of sexual assault from disclosing their experiences. I believe this is an important topic because it can hinder a victim's access to support and, possibly, justice. Additionally, it prevents that victim from contributing to the support of future victims while also helping maintain a culture of victim-blaming.

I will limit the phrasing of my questions to the theoretical, 'if you experienced' rather than 'when you experienced'. However, this is not due to a lack of awareness, but rather to aid in creating an environment conducive to responses without asking victims to open up more than need be.

So I ask/

1. If you were to experience a sexual assault, who, if anyone, would you tell?
2. Can you identify distinct barriers to disclosure with different people? If so what are they? I.e What would keep you from telling your Mother/Father/Brother/Sister/ Friends/Boss/Police etc.
3. Can you identify any trends in who you would seek support from?
4. Are you comfortable providing any demographic data about yourself? E.g. Age range, location(Country/state and urban/rural), family status, career field.

This is a topic that could not be possibly covered in a handful of questions. If you would be interested in participating in a lengthier interview, please indicate as much and I may message you directly.

Thanks so much for your responses!",omeezuspieces,2019-02-27 15:27:27,1,252,62.04,91.13,9.4,25.77,12.6,27.78,88.89,51.59,15.48,9.92,2.78,0,6.35,0,0.79,5.56,5.56,13.89,8.33,3.97,7.14,1.19,13.89,3.17,1.98,2.78,1.59,1.98,7.94,3.97,3.97,0,1.59,0,17.46,1.98,0.4,1.19,0.79,17.46,3.17,1.59,5.95,5.56,0.79,6.35,2.38,0,0,0.4,1.19,0,0,1.19,0,11.51,2.38,0.79,6.35,0.4,1.59,0.4,9.52,1.19,6.75,0,4.76,1.98,2.38,0.79,0.4,0,0,0,0.4,0,0.4,0,0,0,21.43,6.35,5.56,0,0,2.38,0.4,0.4,0,1.98,0.79,3.57

He has no job, money, relationships, nothing so my parents won’t kick him out. He’s very toxic and abusivr- he screams, yells, steals and demands money from my parents for cigarettes or gas. When he actually does have a substantial amount of money he blows it on drugs. He eats all of our food and sleeps most of the day when he isn’t terrorizing us. I haven’t made eye contact with him or spoken to him in over a year even though we live in the same house, I’m just scared of him and I never know when he will snap

I will be moving out after I’m done with my first two years of college so I’m happy I won’t have to see him but I’m still scared for my mom and younger brothers . He hangs out with the wrong kind of people so I’m not only scared for their mental health I’m also scared for their safety.


I’m just really scared and freaked out and I don’t know what to do right now. I really want him out of the house but I don’t want him living on the streets and he will definitely not leave voluntarily",salsafromSanMarcos,2019-02-27 16:37:09,2,254,12.57,45.3,43.9,1,25.4,11.81,94.09,60.63,19.69,18.11,8.66,1.97,0,6.69,0.79,1.57,3.54,13.39,10.63,9.06,10.24,4.33,18.5,5.91,2.76,1.97,3.54,1.18,7.09,1.18,5.91,2.36,1.57,0,15.35,3.94,0.39,0.79,8.66,10.24,0.79,1.18,0.79,1.57,1.57,5.12,1.97,0.79,1.18,0,4.33,0.79,2.76,0,1.18,9.06,5.12,0.39,1.18,1.18,1.18,1.18,13.78,1.97,12.99,0.79,5.91,5.91,0.79,0.39,1.57,1.18,0,0,0.39,0.39,0,0,0,0,17.32,3.15,3.54,0,0,0.39,0,0.39,0,5.91,3.94,0
avnfs2,When he put his hands around my throat after telling me he loved me...,"[https://imgur.com/a/OJ4Brx6](https://imgur.com/a/OJ4Brx6)

**A personal story:**

When you shoved me against that brick wall, hands grasping my throat, I looked into your eyes glaring back at mine. I almost didn't recognize you.  Was this the person who told me they'd never lay a hand on me? Loved me? Wasn't this the person I felt safe with--one whom I shared peacefully my physical and emotional sanctuaries? The one who told me he'd love me forever and ever and ever?

Your face was inches away from mine. Face stern, you started cursing at me, calling me explicit names--my vision started spinning and fear paralyzed my body. Maybe because I've grown **so grossly** **accustomed** to tolerating the verbal abuse for these past months that those words fell deaf upon my ears. I walked home with you after that incident. A classmate of mine who saw us would later tell me I didn't look OK that day. Boy, tell me about it.

Then, you stormed into my room. I knew you were furious at this point, and I told you that I'd later forgive you--no matter what--and that I'd always care about you. Because, to be honest, I can't hold a grudge for shit. Next, you told me when things got rough, we should talk it out, and I agreed.  But just as quick as I remembered you saying those words, you had your hands around my throat again. This time I didn't know if you were going to let go. My stomach and vision were reeling wildly. When you released your grip, I looked down at my hand. Red. A nail had fully torn off during the scuffle and all I saw was the colour red.

I'm not sure how many times you've shoved me up against my bedroom walls. Days later bruises would show up on my legs to taunt me, as if keeping count for me. I'm also not sure anymore if I want to remember how you picked up picture frames and smashed them on the floor; how you tore my favourite books and flung my laptop; how you grabbed my mirror and kicked it to pieces. I'm not sure if I ever want to remember hearing you, the person I loved and felt safe with, threaten to hurt me.

When all was said and done that night, I cleaned up every glass shard on the floor, every wooden piece lying on the ground. When my fingers got cut and blistered, I kept picking up the shards anyway. Each piece I picked up was a reminder of a piece you tried to break in me, but didn't succeed in doing.

You told me I was a whore and that I deserved to be pushed into walls for posting nudes. You told me I deserved to have your hands around my throat because I saw someone else when we broke up. Whatever the reason may be, I can't wrap my head around a justification for committing violence and verbal abuse to another human being. Especially someone you claimed to love. There isn't a justification.

**And here is how I should have prevented it all:** My mistake was not listening to the warning signs when you told me you fell in love with me instantly. You wanted to get into a relationship so fast. When we broke up for the first time, I didn't fight you on it. I let you go. But you came back--*every* god damn time. And I regret every god damn time I took you back because I enabled your verbal abuse, silent treatment, and gaslighting. I let you take out your violent tirades on me, endured your physical shoves and harsh words--sometimes without any provocation. Over time, I learned to drown out those words, and grew cold to your touch that had hurt me. In hindsight, I had the power to stop it all and leave. But I stayed because I knew you were hurting, and I wanted to be there for you.

I've apologized and tried to accommodate you many times. You said you'd get over the past, and I said I'd get over your mistakes too. I thought if we were patient enough, maybe we would come out of this together. But, all this time you told me I had to fix you. When really, the only responsibility we each have is to fix ourselves.

I'm not sure how many third parties got involved in this mess and have also gotten unnecessarily hurt. What I've learned is that those who have been involved and hurt--family and friends--are the silverlining and heroes of this story. I thought, after this, that I would be jaded, but I've found strength and love from those around me; and it has taught me that something good and loving can still blossom from the grave we've dug ourselves into.

I've said this multiple times during our relationship, and now I mean it more than ever: All I wish is for us to heal, and this time, in our own separate ways.

avte8e,For the people who question why “she” stayed,"Ive known my S/O since we were 12. We married at 21. He was my best friend, and my family liked him. We were married less than 6 mo the first time he got physical. He hit me in the face and twisted my arm behind my back. I was driving, and almost crashed the car, since he pushed my face into the steering wheel. I pulled over and tried to leave, only to have a police officer stop me. He didn’t see the fight but he saw me get out and leave, and was concerned. 
I was young and scared. I was mad at my husband but didn’t want him arrested. He was fresh out of training for the military and I thought he was just dealing with stuff. So I said I was fine and went back to the car.

Yes, he hit me. But it didn’t feel like enough of a reason to leave. He loved me. He just needed help. We shouldn’t have been fighting. I started it. I couldn’t just throw away our lives together over one argument. I told myself what I needed to hear and I stayed.

The second time he hit me, we had moved across the country for his military career. Still married less than a year. I was thousands of miles away from family, in a different time zone. It was just us. I knew it was wrong and I threatened to leave. But I loved him and I wanted it to work out with us. I didn’t want to run back to my parents with a failed marriage. We are religious and divorce is frowned on. I was sure he was a good guy. He was just having a hard time. He needed support.
So I stayed. Even though I knew it wasn’t ok for him to treat me like that. Even though I knew I deserved better. I had hope that HE would be better, that if I just gave him a chance, he would treat me right. 

And so it continued. I got pregnant, had a child. I quit school to stay home and take care of our son. I struggled with post part in anxiety and depression. And he continued to abuse me. Physically, mentally, emotionally. I wanted to leave, but I had a baby to think about, and no money, no resources. He controlled our finances. Our vehicles were titled in his name. He would get angry and tell me to get out. I would beg him to stay because I had nowhere else to go. He would take my keys and tell me if I left with our son, he would call CPS and tell them I was unstable and take him away. I had no family. So I sold my dignity for a roof over my head and a chance to be with my son. It wasn’t prostitution but it might as well have been. I gave up my freedom for his mercy. And every time he hit me and I stayed, his claws dug deeper. Every empty threat made it harder to leave. The more powerful he became, the more helpless I was.

He gaslighted me. He blamed my depression and anxiety for his poor treatment. And the worst part was, he was still there for me. He was abusive and cruel, but he could also be loving and gentle, supportive and sweet. He was a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and he could play a really convincing sheep. He fed my hopes of a happy life one day. If I could just be a better wife, a better mom. If I could just get my act together. If we could just go to counseling, or have regular date nights. We just needed help, a chance to rediscover ourselves.

I moved back home and he said he would follow. Then he asked for a divorce. I was scared of him but I was terrified of a life without him. He was the monster I knew. Single motherhood was the beast I’d never faced before. So I begged him to reconsider. He did. He said he would give ME a chance to prove I could change, that I would get a job and finish school... he wanted the girl he married back... too bad she was the one he had slowly destroyed. I didn’t know if she was still in there but I promised I would try to revive her. 

And I did. Slowly but surely, I got back on my feet. I got a job. I enrolled in classes. I put our son in daycare. He told me he was proud of me. I wanted so badly to believe him. So when we fought about our messy apartment or our finances or how I didn’t help him enough with school, I took the blame. Why not? I always had before. It was just easier to be the scape goat than to argue. 

But slowly, so slowly even I almost didn’t see it, I was becoming more independent. I was ready for my freedom. I rebuilt my self esteem. And finally, I told him I couldn’t do it anymore. HE had to change, or I would leave. 
The last time we fought, he hit me in front of our son. I was determined to leave. I took pictures of where he hit me. I planned to call the cops. And then he threatened to kill us. All of us. Me, my son, my family... I lost my nerve. I knew he could, and it scared me.
I didn’t know what to do. So I stayed. But I started telling myself I would leave. Soon. I just needed a plan.

And then, I found out. I found out about his girlfriend. The one he said he loved. The one he said he wanted to run away with. He’d introduced her to my son. He’d promised to marry her. And I realized what I was doing to myself. It wasn’t the sex that broke me. It was the lies. The one thing I’d held onto tighter than anything for 5 years of marriage was that he loved me. He was a broken person with issues and he needed help, but I still blindly believed he loved me, he just didn’t know how to show it. When I found out about the cheating, I left. I took our son and ran. I filed for a CPO and got it, probably because I still had the pictures from our last fight on my phone. We are soon to be divorced. And I know with every fiber of my being that if I hadn’t caught him cheating, we would still be together. I would’ve kept lying to myself. I would’ve kept hoping. 

I still don’t understand why. Why I couldn’t just leave. Why I let him break me like that. I knew I deserved better. I knew I should leave. I was desperate to get away. But I stayed. For a thousand little reasons, but also for one big one: I was afraid. And you know what? I’m still afraid. I’m afraid of being a single mom who isn’t there enough for her kid. I’m afraid of being broke and not having enough $$ for things he needs. I’m afraid of people judging me, of losing friends because I’m getting a divorce. But I also have peace in knowing I’m doing the best thing for me and for my son. 

I know it’s easy to judge and point fingers and victim blame. We even do it to ourselves. We’re so used to being the problem in their eyes, that we can’t stop being the problem even if we are lucky enough to get away.
But here is the thing... until you’ve had to pimp out your soul for a roof over your head or food in your stomach, you don’t know. So let’s point the fingers at the ones who deserve it. The abusers.

avtwil,Is This Abuse? Part 1,"I'm sorry but this is going to be really long and I have notes I've kept to add to this that I won't be able to post in one shot, here's the beginning of everything. 

(C/H current husband M/R Male Roomate also ex E/H Ex Husband kids=my 5 kids) 

I've been married to my current husband for about 2 1/2 years and like an idiot, I fell fast and didn't give us the time we needed to get to know each other. We met irl and never online. It was a night I wanted to go out and just have some drinks with my roommate (male) and it was a bit far from my house. We started talking at the bar on the stools, neither of us were drunk and we got along really great. He was there with his best friend. We spent the entire night pretty much staring at each other and swore we met before. By 2am we kissed each other and that's not a normal thing for me nor him. I don't like PDA's. My MR left on his own and stupidly, I invited this stranger to my house. My kids were not there btw- and MR went back to the house regardless. 

We spent the night together (something else I don't do) and by the next day we were already saying we love each other. We both were kind of crying. He had to go home cuz he didn't bring his insulin (Type 1) so we said goodbye and talked on the phone for a week. We'd meet up every week and spend time together. After a month we decided to get married- I know, stupid considering this is my 2nd marriage. But it just felt right. He moved in as my MR moved out by Oct. Side note- my MR was once my BF and we decided to just be friends. He was my witness at my marriage too. Well, the day he was leaving he told me he loved me and my CH overheard. That caused some drama but it ended fast. 

My honeymoon was right after that. Nothing big, just stayed at a nice hotel for a few days. On the way there, I had brought my green tea with me that's in a bottle. The cap must've been loose and it spilled a bit in his console. This man that was so mild mannered turned into a crazy person. ""What the fuck is wrong with you! Are you an idiot!! You have to be retarded!!! Stupid bitch!"" I started to sob and got out of the car in the middle of nowhere and he peeled away. I left my phone in his car so I couldn't call anyone to help find me. He finally came back and demanded I get it. I didn't want to but I also didn't know where the Hell I was. He drove us to the room and tried to be nice to me, apologize etc. 

I was raised in an abusive home and have had abusive relationships as well. I knew right after this happened I was more than likely back in one. I didn't want to believe that. Not again. He blamed his sugar being low and told me it makes him mean add forget things. I never was with anyone with diabetes so I assumed that was true. But then things just kept getting worse...",krazirenee,2019-02-28 09:46:05,3,580,30.03,62.2,80.72,10.52,12.89,9.83,93.62,58.45,21.38,15.52,8.45,3.1,0.52,3.45,0,5.86,5.17,12.24,9.31,5.17,6.72,3.1,20.34,5,2.24,0.34,1.55,2.93,5.34,2.07,3.28,0,2.07,0.69,16.03,1.38,0.86,0,5.34,10.52,2.07,0.52,1.03,1.55,1.55,3.97,1.72,0.34,0.86,0.34,1.72,0,0.34,0.17,0.86,10.86,6.9,0.52,1.9,1.72,0.34,10.86,8.45,0.52,16.21,3.1,7.93,6.03,0,0.86,1.38,0.52,0.17,0,2.41,1.03,0.69,0,0.34,0,16.38,7.07,1.55,0,0,0.17,1.21,0.52,0.34,3.28,1.38,0.86

aw1bkl,Not sure,"I never thought to post in this subreddit and I definitely have not gone through the horrible experience and pain what everyone else has gone through. I always thought domestic violence was being hit or pushed really hard? My ex was emotionally manipulative but I keep replaying some fights. He has thrown my leftovers down the stairs, my luggage and things out the door one time after I said we should end this.  He has grabbed my foot and tugged it towards the edge of the mattress to grab my wrists and pick me up and locked me outside the room after kicking me out and me refusing to leave. He then opened the door and sort of fake charged at me after I was pounding on the door to at least le me get my things. He has pushed me back after I tried to shove past him blocking my entrance. He has said terrible names and things during arguments.  I in turn have called him an asshole and once slapped his hand when he tried to cuddle with me after being really mean and I told him to please get off. He broke up with me coldly about a month ago. He had been cheating/ broken up with me for someone else. After a month of silence, he told me he loved me on valentines day and ghosted me. I'm just preparing myself if he ever comes back.

awa1v3,Feeling hopeless,"I’ve never felt so much despair.  Things have not been so bad (with the abuse) but we all know it’s a cycle and it will rear its ugly ahead again in no time. I think I I posted just a week or two ago about my last episode.

I was actually taking more steps in planning to separate from my abuser and I’ve hit every speed bump and road block possible.  As bad as things have been in the past I’ve always told myself it’s ok.  Things will improve with time.  Don’t give up.  Keep trying.  And here and there things would happen and work in my favor, I’d have one or two set backs and then another bit of luck.  I felt like I wasn’t making headway and there was an exit in sight.  I was starting to feel like I was getting my head above water financially.  With help from a friend I was able to get my mortgage payment current.  I paid off a property lein with a disbursement from my retirement fund (the taxes I will pay later will hurt).  Since New Years he has not been working consistently if at all really and seems to expects me to pay all the bills, feed us, and fund his marijuana Rx needs. 

Today I feel like my hopes dreams got crushed.  I got turned down for an equity loan because my credit was so bad.  I’m so mad at myself for being in this situation because of him.  I’m mad at the loan officer for acting like getting this loan was going to be so easy when he was just talking out of his ass and being a salesman.  He didn’t know a damn thing about what I could get approved for with a loan. I’m mad at my abuser, for watching me struggle, who says he’s here to help me, but he’s not doing shit.  And he masks his dependency on me as loyalty.  I hate that I’m afraid of what will happen if I leave but I need to. 

I’m not one to breakdown and cry.  I’m the type to remain oddly calm in extreme situations.  But right now I feel like bursting into tears at work.  I’ve never felt so down in my life.   And I’m in my head about it because I know there are victims out there in much more severe situations.  They don’t have friends/family nearby to help or a home to call their own, but I am feeling just as helpless at the moment.

awbwjn,Help. I’m at a loss..,Hey everyone. I’m asking help to see what I can do in my situation. I married young at 22 I’m 23 now and I have two beautiful children with this woman. I’m a male 23 in the state of FL. Long story short she hits me in front of the kids yells at me says I’m a drug addict when I work for the power company and they do drug test and what not. I’m paying all her bills and mine since she doesn’t work. But she just for a job with a big company and will start later this month. I wanted to know if I can go get these cases where she’s hit me filled with the police without filing charges and getting her job stripped away from her. I can’t pay all the bills and now child care by myself. I have multiple videos of her  hitting and threatening me on multiple occasions. Her calling me names and hitting me with object in front of the kids. Help guys. She still thinks we can get a house together and I know if I get a house with her I’m going to jail be you her she can say I hit her or she and the kids will be screaming and crying and the neighbors will call the cops and I’m out of there. I want to build a case of her (at least document things that’s she’s done) so I’m ready for the battle ahead. Any help will be appreciated.

he says he doesn't remeber. 

he has never hit me before but he has pushed me up against walls in heated arguments. 

only problem is i know i'm mentally abusive. 

i have bpd so if he even leaves the house unless it is work related i fear he will never come back and i act out. 

i'm in therapy but it doesn't help, i can't seem to change my own brain. 

he lets me do whatever i want, he doesn't control the money, he gives me money whenever i ask (i'm a stay at home mom)

awhvxu,I genuinely don't know what to do.,"I got accepted into a DV transitional housing program, but my kids are almost grown and refused to go. They live the normal upper class suburban life and don't want to leave. I called the police and they validated that I can't force kids of this age to leave. I don't want to leave them bc I've been told that it could be redirected at one of them even though to date that hasn't ever happened. I also can't go to the program without my kids as it's a woman/kids program. 

My spouse is leaving the country in approximately 2 1/2 months, so we're selling the house and dealing with all of that as well. The new country doesn't seem to have programs in place in case this continues and divorce/splitting assets will be much more difficult. The abuse and threats have gotten worse this year. It's no longer just bruises. It's now my head being hit a couple of times also. Friends/family want me to leave, but I have a lot invested plus most importantly my kids would be remaining with him which concerns me.

Typical promises and apologies. He seems sincere, but then a few hours later I'm not so sure. So that's where I'm at. All I would like is to be safe and know that my family is as well. He's a great person until these random moments happen. He rarely drinks, has never used drugs. He does have Asperger's and isn't the best with communication, but refuses to participate in any type of counseling. That being said, again... other than these random moments that aren't predictable, he's a good provider and a good person. It's very confusing to me sometimes, but I need to truly make a decision before relocating to the other country.",PenguinPlates,2019-03-02 05:43:55,0,310,22.31,30.28,70.28,78.87,14.09,16.13,94.52,57.42,17.42,10.32,6.77,0.32,0,1.94,1.29,7.1,5.81,11.94,12.58,6.13,9.03,4.19,21.94,6.77,3.55,0.97,1.29,3.55,6.13,4.52,1.61,0.65,0.65,0,10.97,1.29,0.65,0.32,1.94,16.45,2.26,1.29,2.26,3.55,2.26,5.48,0.32,0,0.32,0,1.61,0.32,0.97,0,0.32,7.74,1.94,0.32,2.9,2.26,1.29,3.23,17.74,0.97,13.87,2.58,4.84,6.45,2.58,0.97,1.29,0.65,0,0,0.97,0,0.32,0,0.65,0,18.71,7.74,2.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.77,0,1.29

awn1ag,I'm so tired,"I left my ex almost two years ago. It will be two years ago this month on the 24th. Recently I found out that through those two years I haven't actually been recovering emotionally. I've just shut down and shut things out. I have a wonderful advisor at school who has helped me, and he's the first person I've cried in front of in a long time. I have started unpacking a lot of emotions, and instead of feeling better I just feel worse. I was blissfully unaware of the fact that I wasn't really feeling much of anything for these past two years, so now whenever I'm not crying I just feel exhausted and numb. It doesn't feel good at all. I don't feel good.

awoitm,Moving Forward,"I'm dealing with the fallout from a fight with my boyfriend, and right now my life feels like everything is just hanging on hold. For reference, I'm 30, he's 36. We live(d) together, no children.

&amp;#x200B;

About 2 weeks ago, we got in a big argument. I had a good day at work, and I came home to him in a bad mood, drunk after sitting at home alone drinking beer alone and watching tv all day. He's injured and has been increasingly negative about everything going on in his life. I've basically been banned from talking about work, but I brought it up anyway as I had some interesting clients and interesting conversations throughout the day. I drank a bottle of wine over the course of the evening, which led to me sort of pressing the work convo. It wasn't directly related to my job, just his thoughts on some things we had discussed that related to bringing up children and the challenges people face, etc. He got really mad at me and I got upset because I felt dismissed. I can't remember what happened, but I'm sure he would say I ""freaked out"", and I think that's possible, but I've had a hard time with him lately in feeling like the aspects of my life that don't involve him are insignificant to him, which is a shitty way to feel. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fight escalated to the point where he punched me in the face and knocked out my permanent retainer, and pinned me face down on the floor in our living room. When I got away from him I tried to kick him in the groin. I went to a friends house, and she took to me to the hospital to get stitches, and then I stayed with her. The hospital called the police, and they served a warrant on the house, broke down the door, and arrested him for domestic battery. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I don't know what to do. I'm alone in our home, he has left the state with our two dogs, which I know because his text messages are linked to his computer, which is in the house. I know I shouldn't be monitoring what he's doing, but it gives me piece of mind to know I'm not going to run into him. I also know from the messages that I bruised his leg badly when I kicked him (I'm not sure if this will affect me legally?). 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a no contact order, and I don't know when his court date will be. Likely in the next few weeks. I'm trying to put together the pieces, but I feel so much pressure coming from my family, friends, job, etc. (his mugshot was posted online). I don't want to give a statement, but it seems like I might have to. The charges are from the state, not me. On one hand, after his court date I just want him to come home and have everything go back to normal (but ya know, yeah), on the other hand, I think I would be okay if he packed up all his stuff (literally all our furniture) and left town giving me a chance to start over. I don't think either of these options are a possibility.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling such a huge sense of loss and despair right now. I miss him so much. I've tried so hard to build a life with somebody that I love immensely and I feel like the rug just got pulled out. I think he is a caring, loving person, I'm feeling so lost and confused and just... yeah I feel like my life is falling apart and I'm just WAITING. I've gone a few times to counseling, but I feel like I'm still in shock and I don't know what to do with myself. I haven't been coping well. I've been drinking too much, not sleeping, not eating. I'm trying to numb out what happened instead of dealing with it, but I don't really know how to deal. I don't know what to expect, and that is terrifying.",whobelongshere,2019-03-02 16:39:40,1,698,40.39,30.29,86.62,9.78,18.37,13.32,92.12,58.6,20.49,16.19,10.46,1,0.14,4.44,0.14,4.3,6.16,14.18,9.6,4.87,6.88,2.87,21.06,2.87,1.43,2.15,0.72,1.86,4.87,1.72,3.01,0.57,0.72,1.15,10.89,0.14,0.86,0.29,4.3,13.04,4.73,0.72,1.15,2.29,1.29,3.58,2.58,0.14,0.14,2.15,3.72,1.29,1.43,0,1,7.31,2.58,1.43,2.01,1.15,0.29,5.3,13.04,1.15,14.47,2.72,8.17,4.01,1.72,1.15,1.86,0,0,0,1.15,0.29,0.14,0.43,0.14,0.14,21.2,5.59,6.16,0,1.43,0.14,0,0,0.29,4.73,1.43,1.43
awpe3o,Help Please,"Hi, I've never posted on here before, but I don't really know who to talk to right now; I'm pretty sure all of my friends and family are getting sick of listening to me talk about all of this. I just broke up with my abusive boyfriend a few weeks ago, as he escalated from verbal/emotional/gaslighting abuse to physical over the course of a weekend, even publicly at one point. We've been in sporadic contact since then, and I'm finding it really hard to just let go of him in my life, even though I don't want to be with him anymore, and apparently he doesn't want to be with me much either. I can't get over this idea I have that all of the good things I loved about him can shine through again and he can go back to being his old self that I fall in love with if only he would commit to getting help and bettering himself. I've been doing a lot of reading about this online, and I know the answer is that they never change unless they want to and I need to go full non-contact on him. I guess I'm just asking if anybody that's gone through this has any pointers on how they squashed those feelings/resisted the urge to talk to their abuser/learned how to give up on the idea that he's ever going to be truly and fully remorseful for the things he's done to somebody he supposedly loves. Any tips/guidance at all would be helpful, because as it stands now I feel like I'm mentally torturing myself over somebody I (logically, but not realistically) know isn't worth it.",anonymous1983i,2019-03-02 18:16:51,17,287,26.8,47.21,63.03,31.72,35.88,13.94,94.43,64.81,21.6,14.63,8.36,0.35,0,4.53,1.39,6.97,3.14,18.82,11.15,9.06,6.97,2.79,18.82,3.83,1.74,1.05,0.35,3.48,5.92,3.14,2.79,0,1.39,0.7,14.29,0.35,1.39,0,4.88,18.82,3.83,1.74,2.79,4.18,3.48,4.18,1.74,0.35,0.35,1.05,2.09,0,1.05,0,0,7.32,3.83,0,2.79,1.39,0,3.14,15.68,0.7,13.94,2.44,6.62,5.23,0.7,0.7,0.35,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.29,2.44,3.48,0,0.35,0,0,0.35,0,5.23,0.7,1.74

awxrdt,I'm scared that I was the problem and that I'll ruin my new girlfriend's life.,"I (f21) left my abusive ex (m23) just over two years ago after a tumultuous 2 year relationship during which time he was verbally and emotionally abusive. Its taken almost all of that time to get my normalcy or identity back. I still blame myself most days. I'll regularly have thoughts such as I pushed him into his behaviour, or his mental health was fine when we got together, he wouldn't have threatened me with violence and suicide if he was in his right mind etc. 

I know that normal people don't lash out the way he did, even when they're irritated or stressed out. I know that he was depressed for a long time before me, and grew up in a home filled with hatred and abuse, HE told me that I wasn't the problem when we saw each other six months after separating. 

I know all of this but I've still internalised all the things he used to say. Jibes about me being manipulative and horrible and having no friends, when he told me that I was abusive because I took a walk when he started smashing things (He said I pushed him into it by intimidating him), when he claimed his threat of knocking me out was in self defence because I (lightly) touched his arm.

Deep down, I STILL believe that *I* was the problem. If I heard my story from someone else I wouldn't, if I saw it written down in a book or on filmed for TV I wouldn't. But I do. *I* was the problem, and bring the same toxicity to everyone I touch.

I'm now with the most wonderful woman in the world, she's kind and mature and understanding. She's patient and loving and makes me feel the safest I've ever felt. But I can't let go of his voice, its still telling me that I'm the problem, so I've deduced that it must only be a matter of time until I break her too.

I'm convinced that whatever I did that drove him to ""fight back"", as he put it, is going to ruin her life. 

Every time we spend the weekend together, I think that I'm taking her away from her friends. When I get upset about her cancelling on me I worry that I'm being controlling. When I say something negative about someone in her life I worry that I'm subconsciously trying to isolate her. Even when I compliment her, I worry that I'm somehow trying to manipulate her.

I know this is a huge wall of text which doesn't make a lot of sense, but can someone please tell me that what I'm going through is normal? I'm constantly beating *myself* up for behaviours I was on the receiving end of. Part of me wants to end things with her just in case I switch like he did. I want to be the best partner I can be, I want to steer clear of codependency and toxicity but I can't stop thinking that its all I know.  

I hope you all have a blessed Sunday.",shady-nastyyy,2019-03-03 11:51:58,2,532,11.48,30.59,82.86,1,20.46,14.85,95.11,62.78,28.38,20.86,13.53,0.56,0.19,6.58,0,7.52,4.32,11.84,10.15,6.02,7.52,1.88,19.55,4.14,2.07,2.44,0.56,2.07,7.33,1.88,5.45,1.88,1.88,0.75,12.97,0,0.75,2.44,4.32,13.91,2.82,1.69,3.01,3.57,1.88,3.38,2.44,0.56,0.94,0.75,1.5,0.19,1.13,0,0,7.52,2.26,0.56,2.44,1.32,1.69,5.83,11.09,1.13,16.54,2.44,6.58,7.89,0.38,0.75,0.19,0.19,0.19,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,16.54,4.7,3.57,0,0,0.19,0,0,0.38,5.08,1.5,1.13
ax1411,Abusive bf threatening to leave..should I take this as my out,"My boyfriend and I have been together 5 years. We share a son and he has a son from a previous relationship that he has partial custody of. I’m living in a private hell since he first hit me 3 years ago. He’s assaulted me 2 times since then, once on Christmas Day, always after he’d been drinking. I’ve never told anyone aside from someone on the domestic violence hotline. I’m living a struggle every day keeping this all a secret. Every day I think the cognitive dissonance will kill me. 

I’m a college graduate, intelligent and successful, have a good job and pretty well put together. I have a lot of family here and good support network of friends. Since realizing his behavior was insidious emotional abuse (with the occasional physical as I stated before) I have been able to better navigate it by not engaging with him. But I know that’s no way to live my life and it’s caused me to develop an autoimmune disorder and panic attacks. 

Anyway we got in a small argument earlier today and now he’s threatening to get a new place. I obviously know the answer as to what I SHOULD do but I’m feeling like I’m not strong enough to let him. Should I take this as my out? I have conflicting feelings because of breaking up our family but I can’t do this forever. And the major thing is I know he’ll get half custody (in a shared parenting state) because I’ve never reported any of his abuse before. Quite frankly I’m embarrassed and ashamed to even admit this to myself let alone my family and friends, who I believe have little to no clue what’s truly been happening to me. I guess my question is if I go along with this how do I get through it? I feel like a shell of who I was before now that I know people like this exist and I’m involved with one.

ax2sw9,Illusion of control: the rationale of retaliation eternal.,"* [Illusion of control cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control). Thanks, Wikipedia. It's often appealed to using glittering generalities like ""accountability"". I made a lot of mistakes using this one:
   * Anarcho-communism. The collective brought me in with their magazine. It was entertaining, and had appeals to emotion like ""FILL YOUR SPINE WITH GUNPOWDER AND LIGHT IT OFF!!!"" I left when they expelled the Traveller Kids, and in announcing it they changed their language habits to that of the Marxists, their long-time enemies. Now I have a ""just stay away from them"" attitude.
   * Punching a guy that sexually harassed me on the stairwell while high on non habit forming sleeping pills. I hadn't discovered advice yet, so I didn't realize I was just in the place at the wrong time.
   * Fighting my parents by use of force of arms in anger and in earnest of length greater than or equal to 12 inches. My parents started it, and I made it a lot worse.
   * This bias is the rationale of vengeance eternal. It's a shortcut for thinking that says when you get into a conflict:
      * there is something objective about your punishment of someone, and something agreeable and un-punitive about how you and your current and prospective allies treat each other when you punish them. It says that your dislike of them is about which person they are. It says you can trust the police and the courts, even if you incriminate the living while doing it alone and alive. It does not say that what you do to them is indiscriminate, nor that they were just in the wrong place, there at the wrong time, or with the wrong person. It does not say that you and your allies treat each other like trash.
      * that what you do to them is effective in getting your way, and is done because of their behavior. It says that behavior is modifiable, both theirs and yours. It even says that you can forgive them and that there is and should still be a relationship. It does not tell you, this is just the wrong person for you or your firm, nor that anyone's behavior is unconditional.
      * It has connections with several other biases, such as hostile attribution and escalation of commitment.
   * It claims to not result in burnout.
   * It makes you do things that you are proud of not wanting to do. This is by definition sad.
   * It puts you in the wrong place, at places in the wrong time.
* Alcohol and hard recreational drugs. This is just plain deadly poison, and has been demonstrated at immense length to be something that Prohibition and war cannot stop. What comes out of it fits a lot of definitions of clinical mental illness, and when someone has mental illness symptoms, I just say, that's not mental illness, they're just drunks or on a toxic med. I met a drunk when I was in prison for fighting against my family. He was there because he broke a promise to stay dry. When you rape or get raped while drunk or high, it's alcohol or the drugs that did that to you. Just stay clean and dry.
   * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol\_(drug)#Adverse\_effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)#Adverse_effects)
   * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False\_accusation\_of\_rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape) Because of alcohol, this is real.
   * the washing machine become hostile when I ate mustard that is made with white wine. Or do I just punch the machine because I have migraines?
* Fears. Have the right fears, not the wrong ones. I screwed up a lot by not following this rule. By definition fear is the attempt to control something not trusted to the point where persistent intra-group conflict is caused by it, the conflict being in large part role conflict. In other words, it's being a control freak where there is no place for you there. Lose your illusion of control. Be at the right place for the time at all times, with the right people.
   * fears that tend to be wrong include the fears of being:
      * alone eg fear of breaking up with someone. This fear is called ""autophobia"".
      * ignored or of ignoring someone eg fear of blocking someone on text or email.
      * replaced eg trying to prove that this person is a cheat instead of just trusting them or ending it with a 24 month no contact period immediately after.
      * embarrassed or forgotten, or of backing down or dropping out of school. I am not sure this is here, but these fears are common in problems. Fears have names. For example mianzi is the fear of backing down or being embarrassed, and athazagoraphobia is the fear of being ignored, replaced or forgotten.
   * you will not stay with who you fear long. There is no place for you there. Someone is about to leave, get run out of there or be made physically unable to leave.
   * I am not sure if there is such a thing as fear of being sober, but if there is it would have to be here in r/rape.
   * by definition it winds you up with the wrong people in the wrong job. Don't get into a situation like that for no reason nor for reasons like ""I didn't know"" nor ""I was drunk"".
* Teen dating. A lot of you are sixteen or 24 years old. You date, but you are kids. You should wait until you are 25 years old before dating. IMO things like having sex, sharing a bed with certain people is by definition a date.
* You haven't followed advice off of YouTube about dating.
   * you lay people who are not your friends.
   * you lay people before meeting their friends or their family.
* You haven't followed advice off of YouTube Red about life. You don't have to get Red, because if all of you followed the other instructions, maybe 80%- 90% of these incidents would never have happened.
* Don't incriminate the living while doing it alone and alive. The only possible exceptions are things like when breaking up with someone or when they're trying to make you look guilty of something. In any case, never press criminal charges. Criminal charges only make the defendant look like William McCaffery or Juan Riviera. It makes them look like an exoneree waiting to happen.",IntrepidDust,2019-03-03 20:15:12,0,1087,47.56,71.58,49.22,1,14.69,18.58,89.14,57.13,16.19,8,2.12,0,3.96,0.18,1.75,8.19,5.34,14.17,9.66,5.24,7.27,2.94,16.74,4.32,1.66,1.66,0.74,1.38,7.36,1.47,5.8,1.56,1.66,0.55,12.42,0.37,0.55,0,0.28,13.34,1.66,3.22,1.01,4.51,0.92,5.43,1.75,0.64,0.74,0.37,3.77,0.28,2.3,0.74,1.01,6.72,1.47,0.74,2.3,0.55,1.75,3.13,11.32,0.18,12.88,1.84,6.72,4.6,1.01,1.47,0.28,0.09,0,0.28,0.74,0.18,0.55,0,0,0,22.54,7.54,3.59,0.37,0,0.09,0.28,0.46,1.1,1.47,0.92,6.72

axas8v,Fake it until you make it (out)? Write a goodbye letter?,"I don't know why it matters to me, as long as I get out.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've been making plans to leave.  Some plans haven't unfolded the way I intended, but I'm still forging ahead.  I'm tired.  It is unbelievably draining to deal with someone who's mood will change instantly over the smallest thing and it can escalate to shouting so much there is spit flying from their mouth, breaking things around the house, and/or physical abuse.  Saying ""you're a dumb bitch"" over something as small as how the pillows were stacked on the bed.  One day it won't matter and one day something small like that matters the most.  And he'll go on a mini rant of how I complain about how he talks to me and that it doesn't matter, just focus on the why and the point of what he is talking about.  It puts you on edge and gives you anxiety on how to treat EVERY little thing you do around this person.  And within a few minutes that same person will call you cute pet names and say they love you and want to hug you and kiss you.  It is confusing and tiring and I'm so over it.  They change up is awful.  Because it CAN be nice at times. And it reminds you of the beginning before they showed their true colors. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've stayed because I genuinely care and was foolishly optimistic that he would improve and be better.  Because that's what he kept telling me at first.  They he was changing, and he wanted me to help him grow.  Then it turned into ""it won't be like that if you know how to act"".  But it shouldn't matter how I act, they shouldn't REACT like that.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, long story not short and to my point - I am planning my way out.  But knowing I'm on my way out, I try my best to act the ""same"".  Like everything is fine, and I feel so submissive and a stranger to myself.  He bosses me around in the oddest was lately, as if to test me on how far he can push me.  I say ""I love you"" and it sounds like a weird echo in my head.  Hollow sounding, almost robotic, because even though I care about him, I don't feel the warmth I once did behind those words.  I am resentful but not vindictive.  I struggle to not lash back out at him when he talks to me so disrespectfully just because he's annoyed.  I keep telling myself to focus and just keep at it because I will be out soon.  It feels so wrong to be so fake, but it feels necessary.  Have any of you had to endure this?  or did you not bother to pretend.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also I have been battling with preparing a goodbye letter.  Why even bother right?  Parts of me want to explain myself, and point out everything bad he did to me, or at least the main points of why I'm not doing it anymore.  But is it a waste of time?  Will it even matter to him?  I feel like abusers are always fake sorry.  Or if it's not fake, the sorry is so temporary.  And in their own minds they convince themselves that none of it is their fault. So what would the point be of writing a letter he would fail to understand.  

&amp;#x200B;

axem0c,I kept quiet about the abuse when I left. Now I'm worried there will be another victim.,"I left two years ago. His reputation is everything to him and if I did anything to jeopardize that, he would have nothing left to lose and I don't know how he would retaliate so I never told anyone. He was and is a pastor and I severed all ties with our community to ensure my own safety. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have regretted the injustice of this because everyone pities him that I left and upholds him as a sweet guy but concluded my safety is worth it. However, now he's engaged. The girl seems just super awesome and they've only known each other for five months and I am wracked with guilt thinking that my keeping quiet may be endangering her. No one is warning her. No one is keeping an eye on her for signs of abuse. And I don't know what to do. Should I come forward? Should I confide in someone from that community what happened and hope they don't tell and that they can keep an eye on her? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, am I alone in this? It only occurred to me recently that for women who leave and keep the abuse a secret probably wrestle with the same things I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

By ""secret"" by the way, I mean no one from that stage of my life knows. My friends, community, significant other, and therapist know now.

axn542,"Just a rant, its long.","I have a protective order against my abuser and up until a few months ago he was violating it via text and Facebook. He had created a fake FB account so that he could message me and I was beyond tired of it. So, I screenshot  the account and the message he sent and posted it stating, in short, that I was tired of it and wanted it to stop so I requested that my friends go and report the account in hopes that it would get taken down. 
Well, in the comments a friend's bf had commented something saying he hopes that he goes to jail ""or worse"" which I just redirected by saying I just want him to leave me alone is all. My abuser's sister saw this comment and started in on the guy asking what he meant by ""or worse"". I knew it was going to go down hill real fast. My friend (the commenters girlfriend) backed him up by saying ""he means worse as in death or overdose"". WTF!!?? I quickly jumped in and stated how I do not wish any harm or death on him!because I don't. 
I used to he madly in love with him, I gave him my all and he gave me my first child. I would be torn if such a thing happened to me. Anyway. The sister didn't believe me and has been giving me the cold shoulder since. I messaged her twice apologizing and then a third time letting her know how upset it was making me that she was doing this, solely because she is just shunning her niece by shutting me out and my baby doesn't deserve that over some body else's words. 
I messaged her one last time giving her the what for, letting her know I didn't owe her an explanation and the only thing I needed to be sorry for was not making said post private so she couldn't see it to begin with. She said ""you are done with him and that's fine be done, why go the extra mile? Stop creeping and having others do so, he doesn't see her and hasn't"". ""Her"" being my daughter. The extra mile? Creeping? Be done? 
I wasn't creeping, I was being harassed via false Facebook account that had a ""suck my dick"" image on it that I knew was directed at me. I was asking other ppl to help me get it taken down! What extra mile? She is trying to make me feel like I cursed his name some how it embarrassed him. And yes I'm done with him but she doesn't know how hard it is to be done when the person you used to give an arm and a leg for won't leave you alone!
I told her that if she didn't want to be a part of my daughter's life then so be it, I won't try anymore and she tried to turn that around on me as if I was keeping her from having a relationship with her niece. Her being there is not my responsibility, it is hers and she has been running me which is only shunning my daughter. I mean am I in the wrong to be so pissed about this??

axorxw,Not my story but my moms,"My mom left her abusive ex husband on Christmas eve a couple months ago, at first he was pretty controlling and he isolated her from her friends, then he started out as verbally abusive only when they'd fight, he started to drink really heavily once we moved in with him which cause issues between him and mom. Things escalated to where he'd get in her face and throw things at her, that was maybe a day or two before we left. The day she left they'd got into a fight over him having a party and they were fighting and when she stood up to leave he walked over and grabbed the tops of her thighs ehich left bruises, he ended up slamming her against the wall before she called the cops and was able to leave. I wasn't home the day when she left and i feel terrible i wasn't able to protect her. Now her ex and his family are filing fake charges against her because she left him, they're tormenting her and i feel useless, it kills me seeing her cry almost every day. I just wish i could do something about all this. Sorry if this is off topic or anything, i don't mean any disrespect to y'all.

axttzx,i dont k ow what to do,"my boyfriend of 10 years is nice to me most of the time. he is helpful loving and a doting father to our 8 yr old son. But then something happens in him where he gets angry over little things and he starts cursing at me horribly. he calls me fat slut , stupid dumb bitch etc. and eventhough he doesnt hit me as often when he does, the blows have gotten more severe. I dont know what to do , he wasnt born in the US but has never been to his birth country so im scared of calling the cops on him. I dont want to listen to his family if he gets deported. I just wish he could accept the breakup and they could all leave me n my son alone. We rent a room from a family friend , so it would also cause a big scene and everyone would know what he has done to me. At the same time, he  is amazing when hes not amgry. It so confusing and hurtful being in this situation. 
im alsp starting to notice that my son has developed anxiety . it hurts my soul so much to see him bite his nails and look nervous. while he hasnt seen his dad hit me often, he has seen him on a few ocassions . He also hears his dad scream at me and my crying. 

i feel like a horrible human being i love my son so much i want to protect him but i also feel scared confused and dont know.how to escape. 


as far as family , everyone has suspicions of my bfs abuse but ive never confirmed amything.  also no one has any space to take us in and my income is sporadic as i work in freelance. if i try to get a steady job my bf sabotages it until i have to quit or get fired

axvg1m,My friends boyfriend might kill her if she doesn’t find an escape route,"My best friend from college has been in a relationship for two years with a boy who was a grade below her in high school. I am very concerned for her safety and don’t know what to do. 

My friend is scared for her life. Her boyfriend has a life 360 app that tracks her every move. He gets notified when she leaves her house, when she leaves school, and when her phone dies. This app also gps her exact location, her battery percentage, when location is turned off, and how fast her car was going and the exact route that was taken. He tracks her every move. 

She is not allowed to talk to anyone including her own family. For a while she was allowed to be my friend but when I would hangout with her he’d get possessive and tell her she had to leave. Now, she was forced to block me on everything and he said if he catches us together he will kill me. He not only threatens to kill himself when she doesn’t do what he wants but he threatens to kill her too. 

He goes through her phone and reads all of her social media and emails. She misses school frequently because he will turn off her alarms while she sleeps. She is terrified to leave. She’s afraid something will happen to her or him if she breaks up with him. 

He illegally made copies of her parents house keys and he has multiple copies. He has picked the locks on her house before and always lets himself in. He forces her to have sex with him when she is not in the mood and he forces her to take drugs with him like MDMA and acid. Occasionally whippets and some other drugs he buys off the the dark web. 

I have thought about going to the authorities because I don’t want to sit around and do nothing because I truly believe that he WILL kill her if she does not find an exit. My own boyfriend doesn’t want me to because he’s worried that because her boyfriend is so charming and manipulative they won’t be able to incriminate anything on him resulting in him coming after me or her. 

A person who does not have insight on the relationship will not be able to see through him. He’s so charming and charismatic and overall likable which is so scary because of what actually goes on behind closed doors. He’s gone as far as holding a knife against his girlfriends throat because she was being too loud on the phone. One time, his dog ran away and when he found her he picked her up and slammed her down and broke her leg. If he can hurt a tiny innocent animal with no remorse he would have no problem hurting my friend or her peers. 

Please give me advice. I’m scared and at a loss. I don’t know what to do.",sreggero,2019-03-05 21:55:53,16,510,12.5,90.87,1,2.18,17,13.14,93.92,63.73,23.92,20.59,3.53,0.39,0,16.47,0.2,3.33,3.73,12.55,10.98,4.51,10.78,3.14,18.82,2.75,1.18,3.14,0.59,1.18,5.88,1.37,4.12,1.76,1.37,1.18,23.33,0.39,1.96,9.41,8.04,13.14,1.57,3.53,2.16,2.94,1.76,3.73,1.96,0.39,0.98,0.39,1.57,0.59,0.78,0.2,0,9.02,3.73,0.98,3.14,0.98,1.37,3.53,12.94,2.16,13.73,3.53,6.67,3.73,0.98,0.39,0.98,0.2,0,1.18,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,0,9.61,5.69,1.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.55,0,0

axzuhh,My (20sF) New Boyfriend (30sM) Is Abuse Survivor - Looking For Advice,"(This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.) I started seeing someone about a month ago, and we fell hard and fast for each other. I met a friend of his, who rudely joked to me that his ex attacked him with a weapon, and since then my boyfriend has given me details of past abuse. As someone who has never been physically abused, **I'm looking for advice from abuse survivors on what I can do for him, such as avoiding triggers.** My boyfriend, D, is in his early 30s and I (female) am in my mid-20s. I am acutely aware that there may be some maturity differences between us, so I try to tread lightly when it comes to experiences I'm unfamiliar with.

D has shared with me that he grew up with anxiety and depression (and from what I can tell, severe body image issues), and in his 20s met women that took advantage of that. He described his experience losing his virginity, and I would label it as rape. One of these women he was engaged to until she got pregnant by another man. She put D into significant financial debt, ridiculed him for his lifestyle, constantly belittled him, and physically abused him, eventually with weapons. One such time she seriously injured him, and he had to defend himself, which he told me caused him a lot of guilt; he never wanted to hit her. Then she injured herself and called the police, nearly charging him with assault.

I don't think he truly acknowledges these instances as abuse. I'm sure it has a lot to do with the narrative that men can't really be abused by women. He's a tall, strong man and I feel awful that anyone thought it was okay to hurt him.

All this is to say that I can see it haunts him. He is head over heels for me because I am ""different"" (ie not abusive), and I want to support him in his recovery (even if he doesn't know he's recovering). I don't want to make him feel afraid that I will abuse him like his exes. I really care about D and I want to help him grow away from these atrocious experiences as best I can.",youdeservedbetter,2019-03-06 07:11:17,3,388,22.68,78.04,1.9,1,20.42,15.98,93.3,59.79,26.29,18.81,7.73,0.52,0,10.57,0,7.47,2.32,14.43,9.02,4.38,6.7,1.8,17.53,4.12,2.32,1.55,0.52,1.55,9.79,2.84,6.96,1.03,4.12,0.77,18.81,0.26,1.03,2.58,10.57,10.57,2.06,1.55,1.55,2.58,1.55,2.06,3.35,1.29,0.26,1.03,2.58,1.29,1.29,0.77,0,7.22,2.58,2.06,2.06,1.03,0.77,4.64,11.6,1.29,8.76,1.55,2.84,4.64,0.52,0.26,0,0.52,0,0,0.52,0,0,0.26,0,0,18.3,4.9,5.15,0,0.26,0,0,0.52,0.52,2.32,3.61,1.03

ay3o7h,A note to myself.,"I made him leave five days ago. 15 years of marriage, over. I met him when I was 20, and was with him 16 years. I knew it was coming, but still, it's been hard. 

Because all I wanted was a happy family. I wanted better for my kids than what I had. 

And I can't give that to them. And I feel like a failure. And I feel lonely, and lost, and scared of the future. 

So I made this note in my phone to read when I have even the tiniest doubt about why I made him leave. It used to be just once in a while, something bad would happen. But now, it's all the time. And he tells me it's me, and that it isn't that bad. And one minute he says it's ptsd behind the behavior, and the next minute he says it isn't that at all. And it's so confusing and such a hard thing to process that my husband just stoped speaking to me, out of nowhere, and increased the aggressive behavior, and it's hard to think that the man I worked so hard for, for so long, choked me. And he doesn't feel bad about it, and he said ""Sorry I did it, but it wasn't that bad, and you deserved it for antagonizing me."" Because I used the word toxic, and he said he wouldn't tolerate hearing the words toxic or abuse in his house because he wasn't an abuser, and then he broke a cabinet, threw crackers at me, and choked me. It makes no sense. 

So if you find yourself in a place like me, maybe it will help to do this too. When in doubt, read it and remember. 

He never had anything to do with you. 
He was bored when you talked. 
He fell asleep while you spoke.
He ignored you.
He slept on the couch instead of with you. 
He didn't help with any of the children as babies or as they grew. 
He told you alcohol was more important than you. 
He made you feel bad for not working, but also encouraged you not to work. 
He treated you like you were stupid. 
He cared more for other people, even animals, than he did you. 
He helped other people, but not you. 
He wouldn't help with the house. The kids. Your life. 
He wouldn't work, and always made excuses for it. 
He ruined the finances, but made you track every penny.
And when you asked he would yell at you.
He called you psychotic. Crazy. Unstable. That you needed medicine. He said things that happened weren't real.
He hurt you. He pushed you. He broke your fingers. He broke you belongings. He threw away things that were yours. He choked you so hard it hurt to swallow. 
He called you a bad mom. And said he didn't like you and didn't want to be married to you.
And then he would tell you he loved you. 
He left you. Over and over. He talked to a woman you asked him not to. 
He told you it was your fault he hurt you. He told you that you deserved it. 
And he said if you didn't shut up, he'd do it again. 
Remember,
He knew what he was doing. He was in control. And he could help others and himself when it was what he wanted to do. He just didn't want to for you.",winowrites,2019-03-06 12:43:01,7,583,5.19,96.38,3.3,1,9.4,9.09,96.4,66.21,30.19,22.13,4.8,0,7.2,9.78,0.34,8.06,4.12,10.46,8.75,4.97,10.63,3.77,21.27,3.95,1.89,1.72,1.03,1.2,6.69,1.37,5.32,0.69,1.03,1.89,24.87,1.03,0,0.34,10.12,14.41,1.89,2.4,2.57,1.89,1.2,5.49,4.46,0,2.06,2.23,2.23,0.51,1.37,0,0.34,6.17,2.06,1.2,2.23,0.17,1.72,12.52,6.52,0.86,10.12,1.89,3.95,4.29,1.37,0.34,0.69,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.41,10.63,5.49,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,3.95,0,0

ayjxew,He slapped me. Am I overreacting?,"Hey everyone, this is my first post ever on Reddit so I apologize in advance for any mistakes in this wall of text I’m about to dump on y’all, also English is not my first language so there’s probably going to to be some typos here and there.

My boyfriend(25) and I(21M) have been in a relationship for about 3 years, he moved in with me just under 1.5 years ago. Since then we have moved into a new apartment, the lease is in my name for financial, legal and practical reasons.
We have a good relationship, and despite us being quite different from one another, we still click well and always find something new and exciting to talk and laugh about. 

For this next part it’s important to note that he’s 186cm tall and significantly bigger stronger than me, I stand at around 172-173cm tall and am generally small.

We like to wrestle and play-fight. 
There’s the occasional light nudge on the back of the head or careful hit on the shoulder but it’s all in good fun and we always laugh it off. Sometimes we get a little too excited and accidents happen, and in those cases we stop immediately and hug and comfort each other. It’s innocent fun and that’s how it’s always been.
And today was no different - that is of course until I grabbed him and in the heat of the moment squeezed him and caused him pain.
He then, instead of pulling away and communicating that I hurt him, raised his hand and slapped me quite hard across the face. I expressed my shock and confusion, and he said that he did it because the way I grabbed him hurt quite a bit. 
He then sat down at his PC, turned to me and said that for a brief moment he was extremely angry and was actually going to hit me a lot harder but he had managed to stop himself.
At this point I was quite upset that he chose to slap me across the face with such force instead of resolving it like we usually do, and told him that if he had done it any harder I would have packed my bags and stayed somewhere else for the night. He didn’t answer and just continued to look at stuff on his pc screen. 
We haven’t spoken since it happened about and hour and a half ago.

Am I overreacting?

aykozj,Throwaway and Advice please - my s/o became violent because I annoyed him.,"Throwaway. My s/o. Not sure if I can even call him that we’re not official but we live together and are romantically involved. I wanna say now I am no way a good person infact most of this that happened I see as karma for shitty things I’ve done in life. 

Anyway he has a temper. I tend to be too playful and can be annoying to certain people. One night I guess I took it too far. He said something to me and I didn’t hear him. Kept asking him to repeat it and he wouldn’t so I playfully got in his lap demanding he tell me. It pissed him off and he kept telling me to get up and pushing me. I reluctantly get up and I’m the process knock over his plastic water bottle ( I didn’t know I did) I make my way back over to the other couch upset. He gets very angry and tells me to apologize. I didn’t. He starts yelling at me and it freaks me out (I’m terrified of yelling and his is scary) so I tell him I would just like to be alone and go to my room. Bad idea.
  Next thing I know he’s screaming and smashing and throwing things. I lock my room door and curl up. He leaves thirty minutes later. I go out to see the damage. Smashed cup,thrown plate, he threw my cats things. Last he ripped a hole through the chest of my stuffed monkey I gave him for Valentine’s Day. I cried a bit and felt scared. The same night he came back like things were okay and I’m stupid because I let it go. This is the second worst reaction he has ever had.

aymizv,My Story of Abuse,"4 years ago, I lived in Salt Lake City. I had a bad coke habit and found a new dealer that I thought was really cute. We started hanging  out and within 2 or 3 weeks I moved in with him. He introduced me to a world I had never seen before and I was so infatuated. A world that was so troubled and dark and messed up but there was something about it .. about him that I couldn’t shake. 

He revealed to me in the 2nd week we were dating that he had kidnapped 2 people (a guy and a girl) that he thought stole something from him at a party at his house the night before. They had fallen asleep and in the morning he held a gun to them and told them to get in the car. He drove them 2 hours out into the middle of a desert in Utah and left them there alone. He was planning to kill them and then couldn’t bring himself to do it, and left them stranded.

At the time I guess I thought I wanted to help him. I wanted him to love me and let me in.

About a month later, I was having a hard time and felt suicidal. We sat on his bed and I cried, saying how I didn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel and how maybe I’m not meant to be on this Earth. He said to me, “Don’t say something like that if you’re not gonna do it. Don’t be a pussy. Kill yourself. Here.” And put a loaded machine gun in my hands yelling “Fucking do it!!!!!!”

Two months later, were having sex. He had a phone out, I thought he was taking pictures as that was a regular thing. He started laughing this demonic laugh. I looked back at him. He was going through my texts and saw an old text calling someone “Babe.” He threw a metal chair at me and loaded his Scorpion machine gun with hollow points and said “There’s so many things I could do to you right now.” For some reason as I sat on the edge of the bed I repeated to him what he said to me. “Don’t say something like that if you’re not gonna do it. Don’t be a pussy.” Looking back I don’t know why on earth I would say that. He took the safety off and aimed it at my head. All the sudden I jumped up off the bed and started screaming for any of his roommates. He had 5. Only one woke up. We were wrestling for the gun when our friend came in. After that night the friend acted like he had no one what I was talking about. The roommate took his side.

Fast forward a year, I move him out to live with me in California. His behavior didn’t change. Cheated dozens of times. I couldn’t bring myself to leave him because he would have been homeless with no money and no job. I was working 3 jobs to support us while he played Xbox all day. 

5-7 times I woke up in the middle of the night to getting punched and/or slapped in the face. He would say it was an accident and that he did it in his sleep, and would never say sorry. I would cover up the bruises on my cheekbones and not say anything.

His phone rang at 11:57pm, his friend was calling. It started him and he hit me in the face. I got mad, and he went back to sleep. He started snoring super loud and I asked him to turn over so he’d stop. He did turn over, but proceeded to strangle me with both hands. Time slowed down, my vision was going blurry. I thought I was about to die. But all the sudden something in me got a burst of adrenaline and I threw my legs up and started kicking him as hard as I could in the neck. It knocked the wind out of him and he fell back. I had bruises around my throat for a week. No one ever knew. And I was working at a treatment center.

I finally got the courage to break up with him when I met another man who treated me better than I ever thought I deserved. This man treated me like he loved me. I now know that he didn’t treat me like he loved me, but that he treated me the way a normal man treats a woman. Respectfully, kindly.. I never thought I would feel the way I do now. I’m not scared. I don’t flinch when he pushes a piece of hair out of my face or when he reaches for an eyelash. 

I should be dead, but instead I’m here, living and happy. I feel alive.

I never pressed charges against him. He seems to have turned his life around, he’s sober now. Recently I’ve been thinking about it thought and  I’m scared that he’s going to hurt someone or even kill someone. His anger is incredible. It’s terrifying. And I’m nervous it will break his family if I press charges.

aynk3s,Accepting my fate as a victim of Domestic abuse,"A little over a year ago on our 3rd anniversary, I experienced absolute and genuine fear for my life after my partner had triggered me into a self harm fit during a physical altercation that lasted over an hour. I was left with a bruised spine (I had been temporarily paralyzed during the fight) a broken jaw amongst damage to my disc in the same joint, as well as other minor injuries. I’m only just now coming to terms with the severity of this event. It didn’t seem like it was so traumatic at the time but now I am faced with a future of possible surgeries to correct this broken jaw he caused. The law enforcement officers were less than courteous, and in fact treated me as though I was the criminal while this man, twice my size and trained in mixed martial arts, was treated as a saint as I sit in my car bleeding. 

I feel, with his sociopathic tendencies, his expertise in legalese, and the clear support from law enforcement of domestic abuse perpetrators in the area, I have no leg to stand on for any semblance of justice. I can’t afford to save anything let alone afford a decent enough lawyer to pursue a pain and suffering suit against him. I feel lost, and alone. 

My only solace right at this moment is the pursuit of possibly retaliation via a different social networking site, gaining his trust online, only to fuck with his head. The man has had rape charges against him before but I believed his probable lies, “the police proved through reviewing their interactions that it was a conspiracy against my social standing in the community.”  He even had an ex who is still madly obsessed with him toxically so, contribute to the lie. She claimed she had seen the reports herself. I doubt she really did. She’s very much a puppy dog under his hypnotic trance that I would not put it past her to convince herself of something that really did not happen. Perhaps he keeps her around to help feed his delusions that he’s a good person when he really is a horrible human being.

I had also found out this past year from my now ex best friend that the two of them had an affair behind my back 2 years ago...and is only telling me now completely ruining a friendship closer than romantic partnership of 20 years. He had made me a cuckqueen in the worst possible way. 

I feel as though I have no choice but to move on with my life, but this strong desire and need for justice is starting to eat me up inside. I feel I have to do something to date this need for justice, so I have resorted to potentially fucking with his head. This man does not deserve to enjoy his life...at least that is how I feel right now. 

I know I’m supposed to be this spiritually enlightened person...loving everyone purely even those who have harmed me...but right now...this discovery through my dentists ex rays officially displaying the true damage he had done to me, in tandem with my past gives me little hope for potential redemption in this man’s life. I don’t see him as being a good person ever.

ayotxb,Giving up,"Boyfriend cheated on me and after I broke up with him he wouldn’t get out of my car. I waited for him to go to class and broke up with him and took all my things from our apartment. He found me walking down the street and followed me to my car and forced his way in. He wouldn’t let me go and was acting as if he was trying to save the relationship. Hours passed and I firmly told him everything he has done to me and that I was finally strong enough to leave. His dementor changed and then after hours of not getting out, insisted I let him out. I went to let him out and as he steps out he says “btw I fucked way more bitches than her”. Trying to deal with that being said to me, I responded “me too it’s cool”. Even though I’ve never even responded to a flirty text before. He stopped midway out of the car and before I even knew what was going on he was choking me for a couple seconds and threw my head against the window. Then he proceeded to punch me harder in the face than I’ve ever thought was possible. All this while screaming “SAY ITS NOT TRUE”. I tried to beep the horn multiple times on a busy busy university street to no avail... my windshield became smashed by him somehow as well. That’s when something happened... a startling but different pain occurred and caused me to scream “STOP I THINK MY SKULL IS BROKEN” and I started to hyperventilate and panic. I lost vision in my left eye, it bled and my cheekbone had immediately grown to the size of peach. He snapped out of it and started to say “come on no it’s not no it’s not... no it’s not.. let me see... let me see”, in almost a sweet tone. I passed out between panics. He suggested taking me to the hospital and I felt like I had no other choice so I scooted into the passenger seat while he frantically drove to the hospital while he was crying too. Funny how I still believe the reason he was crying was because he believed he was about to be caught, not because he hurt me. We arrived and he repeatedly says “______  please please don’t use my real name (he has other charges against me...) use a fake name and you have you say you were... in an... accident” I complied. I sat in the ER for ten hours explaining my ‘car accident’ with him. Talking as if everything was normal, when we did speak those couple times. I was diagnosed with a TBI and multiple eye socket (orbit) fractures and needed emergency surgery and plastic surgery. I still protected him. He apologized and says he is going to change. He said the thought of cheating now makes him queasy. He stopped though, saying he will never hit me again.

If you get anything from this story... please don’t ignore red flags early on. Because of this, I am now what feels like stuck. He didn’t abuse me until over a year into the relationship but take my word for it, gaslighting, screaming and yelling during fights is the first big red flag. I feel like I cannot escape even though there’s a direct and physically easy way out. I feel like I’m in a psychological prison. I have thought of killing myself every day. I no longer find joy in life. I’m just living day by day. I wake up every night in a cold sweat from flashbacks and nightmares from this (which is what caused this post).  And lastly, I know it’s just a matter of time before even worse happens again.

Don’t live your life like me.

First, Life360. Tracks driving, walking even speed you are driving in vehicle. Even how fast you're walking with some of the premium features. 

Second, mobile tracker. It's sole purpose is for managing business phones but the obvious controlling person can find it's gain. It can be hidden (not entirely sure if it'll display in hidden apps list on phones either) and remotely will record both voice and video. The minutes it's downloaded, can view messages from phone or any social platform, history, and saved passwords on it. Can disable features and apps as well. Can get locate, app usage and times of what apps you used. Same for each website.

az05oi,I’ve lost faith in the system.,"So on Valentines Day my ex had his hearing. I was told by the DA that they were trying to reach a plea deal and not to come in unless she notified me(I was terrified of being in the same room as him). The court date came and went, I saw that the DA had asked for a continuance. Ok, whatever...

Today they issued a material witness arrest warrant on me. I have been trying to get ahold of them, leaving messages, but none were returned. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m terrified of being arrested. I’m terrified of seeing him. I’m terrified of the results of this arrest on my life. Why would they do this to a victim???? The surety bond is set at $5,000. Far more than my exes 2nd domestic violence bond was set at. I can’t pay even 10% of that as I’m a single mother.

az47e8,Im so scared even posting here.,"So my husband and I have been together since I was 15. It's been 16 years. We have two children 7 and 4 years old. We have had a great relationship.
Suddenly. After 16 years he has really scared me. The first time it got physical when when I handed him the electric bill and he snapped. He punched a hole in the closet door. He grabbed me tightly by the hair and brought me over to the stove, turned the burner on and held my face very close to it. I thought I was going to die. He said to me, ""I'm not going to do it but I want you to know I can"". He released me and walked calmly into the other room. I was hysterical and I went outside in my car and called the police.
The police came and I told them everything. They went inside to talk to my husband. He came outside with them very calmly. Then while they were talking (I was in the car with the windows up), an ambulance comes and they put me on a psych hold! 72 hours. While I was in the hospital I was served with a restraining order against my children and lost custody due to the police filing a domestic violence report against me. 
After multiple court dates he decided he ""would give me another chance"" and everyone thought he was a God send for ""helping"" me. 
It has been a few months and he is constantly reminding me that he can make it so I'll never see the kids again. And it's true. So I stay and try not to make a peep and really put my energy into enjoying and loving my children. They are everything to me.
Yesterday we were having sex and he jumped on top of me and started to strangle me. Called me a ""dumb fucking bitch"" multiple times. I reached out to his mom because I have no family. When I told her what happened she laughed and told me to give it up.
I want to leave but can't leave my children. With my now criminal record and lack of resources (I don't work and he controls all the finances) I don't stand a chance of being with them.
I used to think it was a small price to pay to be with them but my spirit is breaking. 
Why would he suddenly be like this? Could he be using drugs? Having an affair? I just feel so lost and alone. I'm trying to do what's best for them yet also be there to protect them. He has never hurt them, but he never hurt me either until recently. 
I don't know why I'm posting but I wanted to reach out to anyone who can relate. I'm so lonely I feel as if my chest is going to cave in.",Neverdoesthedishes,2019-03-09 06:49:37,16,490,19.36,38.74,83.04,14.5,12.25,12.45,93.47,63.88,23.47,19.39,11.84,0.61,0.2,4.49,2.24,4.08,5.71,12.45,10.61,5.92,9.18,2.04,21.02,3.47,1.63,1.63,1.63,1.22,4.49,1.63,2.45,0.41,0.61,1.22,13.88,0.82,0,0.61,4.49,10.82,1.84,1.84,1.63,1.22,1.63,3.06,1.84,0.2,0.41,1.22,1.43,0.41,0.61,0.41,0,7.35,1.84,1.63,3.47,0.61,0.41,7.76,11.22,1.02,16.12,4.08,5.31,6.73,1.84,0.2,1.43,0.82,0.41,0.2,0.61,0.61,0,0,0,0,13.88,7.35,0.82,0,0,0.61,0.2,0,1.63,2.45,0.82,0
az72aq,judge called me (the victim) the instigator yesterday,"Going through a custody battle with a coercively controlling ex.  The pattern is clear and well established, and went on for years.  After my attorney presented his case, it was my ex's turn (he's pro se).  In an effort to get my ex to stop wasting time talking about an incident five years ago and move forward to the present, the judge said, ""Anyway, she was the instigator in that case.  So let's not waste time on this.""    


He also referred to a situation where a 30-year police veteran testified that he arrested my ex because he was the most dangerous kind of abuser (after he cut the phone line when I tried to call the police), and the judge said that ""nothing really happened that night.""  I was stunned and it gave me the impression that none of the domestic violence we've presented is going to be considered as DV by the judge.  


We still have an opportunity for further testimony and closing argument to try and educate the judge, but I wonder what good it will do.  I'll try my best, but I'm disappointed by it.

az74cy,Fiancée says she “wasn’t in control” when she hit me. What to do next?,"I made a post in r/relationships when it was suggested I come over here. I’m a 24 y/o guy and my fiancée is 23. For background, my girlfriend and I dated for 3 years before I proposed last summer. Since then she’s been suspiciously hiding her phone from me when she’s texting other guys. When I confronted her about it last night we got into an argument which ended with her hitting me a couple times and drawing blood on the last hit. I was shocked and unsure of what to do so I just closed myself in another room and slept alone.

This morning when I saw her she apologized and had cooled down so I tried to talk to her about it. I told her nothing said gave her the right to hit me and asked her if she could promise that this would never happen again. She told me that she couldn’t promise that, and that she wasn’t in control when it happened. She went on to explain how she’s no longer in therapy or on the meds she needs to be on anymore. She said that last night she told me to leave during the argument when she was getting upset (which was apparently her way of warning me to leave before I’d get hurt). She said it was my fault for escalating the argument to the point where she was willing to hit me (or lose control, as she puts it). By then she started getting upset again and said she’d try to make sure it didn’t happen but said “her unemotional self can’t make promises for her emotional self”. 

I don’t know what to do next. How do I leave without making a mess of things or getting into another situation where she’ll attack me? She’s blaming me for getting hit and I can’t seem to get her to promise that it won’t happen again.

azemcm,Canadian DV Advice,"I have a friend who is Canadian who is going through domestic violence whereas I am US based, which is why I came to reddit instead of calling a helpline.

She is 23 years old, has a 2 year old son, and has been with her now husband since she was 16. She left home and lived with him as homeless from 16 until 21. This guy has kicked in their shared apartment door, tied her up (after she called the police) and was threatening to burn her alive. She has dozens of photos of black eyes and bruises. It's not great to say the least.

She has called the police several times, but has never pressed charges. She fears for her life as this individual committed armed robbery in 2012, has several family members in prison for murder, and comes from an all around dangerous place. 

She fears to report his armed robbery from 2012 since she is the only one who knows even though there is a crime stoppers search out for him from then, and she fears pressing charges. Her main concern is custody for her Son. What are her options?

azhqst,I'm (21/f) supposed to move in with my BF (22/m) soon but I'm questioning it over his anger and past actions,"I'll try not to make this too long but I've been with my boyfriend for close to 18 months now and we have plans to move in together once we finish university in May. However, I'm really questioning it due to him not being fully in control of his anger.

From about June last year he got really paranoid over the people i slept with before i met him and he would question me everyday about it. It got really uncomfortable and he'd even ask about what sex positions I did with those people. This questioning lasted months and he got mad if i refused to answer him and he'd say that I was lying to him or hiding things from him. It all stemmed from me forgetting one small detail about someone i slept with as a result i got branded a liar.He even got physical with me a few times and i never knew how he'd be when i saw him. At times he got triggered by something when we were watching on tv and that would be enough for him to lose his shit and get physical with me. I'm not perfect there were times he'd ware me down so much that I'd retaliate out of anger and frustration.  

He called me a hoe, slut and many other names whilst this was going on. He says he's sorry for everything hes done and hasn't been physical with me in a while but i still get scared at times when we argue. He's been a bit controlling over things like me getting my laptop fixed and about my uni work. I started an assignment late and did my best to get it done, the night it was supposed to be submitted i asked him to come over for support while i finished it. Instead he told me that I'm a failure and i submitted it like 2 minutes late but it was fine. The next day i said i tried my hardest to which he responded by saying i didn't and i got so frustrated i ended up hurting myself and he basically ran away. 

He's always quick to blame me and says that I'm the one responsible for all the issues in our relationship. It's not all gloom and doom we have good moments and he is my best friend i just don't know how long i can carry on whilst still feeling hurt and resentment of the things he's done. At times I feel dumb for staying with him because it makes me feel weak but when we're good I'm happy so i feel very conflicted. He's been better recently but I'm still a bit wary what should i do?

azkwob,Children hinted at abuse while in mothers care,"Long time reader, first time poster. On mobile so sorry for editing issues. Long story ahead. Throwaway. 

My boyfriend (27M) and I (26F) have been together for a little over a year. He has two children (8M and 5M) from previous marriage. We'll call them Mikey and Robbie respectively. Mikey is not biologically his, but bf has been there since birth and is known as dad. Robbie is his. He's in the military in one state, ex (Samantha) and children lived 3 states over. Seeing/speaking to kids has always been a hassle, as Samantha makes things extremely hard/cancels at the last second.   Co-parenting is difficult due to her always belittling, berating, or degrading bf in front of the children, or trying to diminish his worth as a father. You can imagine how children view bf because of this. If we want to see the kids, we HAVE to drive there and spend it in their state. We've tried flying but with all the cancellations, driving is a safer bet. 

It should be noted, that bf ended the marriage, not her. Parenting plan is outdated, and is from State of divorce that both parents no longer live in. As of September of last year, out of nowhere Samantha has been enforcing that Mikey is not his, and cuts off contact randomly or will refuse to let us see him. If she needs something from him financially, suddenly that's his son again. BF is hesitant to enforce or modify parenting plan because Samantha may retaliate and refuse to let him see Mikey ever again. He has also considered adopting Mikey, but is concerned that he'll pay more child support and then STILL not be able to see kids as often as he'd like until parenting plan is modified. When they were first married, bf wanted to adopt, but held off as Samantha wanted to keep receiving payments from bio dad. She now holds this over bf saying he should've adopted when he had the chance. That along with the unpredictability of being in the military, it's been a long process trying to figure things out.

Now this is where shit gets out of hand. We fought for weeks to get BOTH children to come to our state for Christmas. Samantha says no, limits him even more, and then after 2 hours, finally says he can have both for Christmas, and agrees to allow him to see them monthly and the entire summer.

A few hours later, Samantha calls crying asking if BF can take kids for an entire school year starting after Christmas break, to allow herself time to figure out her finances and focus on school. We jump at the opportunity and say yes and prepare for their arrival. My job is more flexible, so with both of us working together, we could definitely give the boys everything they need and more. Samantha had spent months drilling into Mikey's head that bf is not his real dad, and then turns around and says ""your living with your dad soon."" This was our first hint that therapy might be a good idea. Mikey HAD to be conflicted. Also, Samantha did NOT want them talking to me because I wasn't ""family."" This was hard on the kids, and they would try to secretly call me until she found out. 

It took a bit of time for both children to adjust. While they were happy, they would say things almost robotic that were rehearsed from Samantha. They have since gotten comfortable, and both children are thriving and are doing MUCH better in school since they've been with us, then they've ever been with her. They also mention how they feel so much happier and wish they could stay longer. Sometime after our last visit with Mikey but before picking him and brother up for Christmas break, he developed a nail biting habit. He also has ADHD, so we chalked it up to that. 

I was praising Mikey on his grades while driving home from school one day, he responds with ""I'm just glad I don't have to sleep in the closet anymore"". Now Reddit, I was very upset, but wanted to tread lightly on this as Mikey is timid and probably would not want to get Samantha in trouble. So I joked and said ""what? Lol the closet?? Why were you in there?"" To keep it light. He went on to say that if he was in trouble, Samantha made him stay in the closet for an extended period of time. I asked for details, and closet is only enough room for him to sit in, and he said he didn't know how long he was in there, but he'd wake up and it was time for school. This would imply that he had been in there for a significant amount of time. A few days later I asked Robbie about it with bf, and while apprehensive, he admitted it was true, and that it only happened to him once, but Mikey a few times. 

We didn't know how to go about this because if we brought it up to Samantha, she'd make up an excuse or say that we were trying to turn the kids against her and demand that they were brought back. We ended up leaving it alone. 

We had to have Mikey tested for ADHD again because Samantha refused to send paperwork so that he was accommodated at school. After the testing, the psychologist recommended therapy and him since his drawings were a little concerning. That along with his nail biting, and our own concerns-it made sense. Him and his brother are scheduled for March 12th. That night, Mikey was holding a box of pizza for me and started to complain that it was getting hot and was starting to burn him. At that moment, Robbie goes ""Lisa one time, Mikey got in trouble at school, and Mommy burned him with hot water."" Before I could even respond, Mikey bursts in with ""Robbie! Mommy told us not to talk about that with Lisa!"" I was so angry I couldn't hold back and I said ""the only reason your mom didn't want me to know, is because you should not harm your children that way and it's the wrong thing to do."" After I said that, Mikey went on to say that after he was burned with the hot water, Samantha made him run around the house, and then ""spanked him really bad."" I was livid. 

We intend to bring it up at their first therapy session. Yesterday Robbie brought it up so i recorded our talk so that bf could hear. Every time the children bring it up, it's just the three of us and I wanted bf to hear for himself. Robbie brought up that Mikey had been burned with hot water more than once. First time, Samantha made him stand in the shower and turn on the water really hot. Second time, Samantha made Mikey stand in the kitchen, while she poured a ""big humongous bowl of hot water"" on Mikey. I asked Robbie several questions: how did he know it was hot? Where was he when this occurred? Robbie said that he could hear Mikey screaming and begging Samantha to stop, and that he had to be in his room while this was happening. 

Reddit this is very concerning. Robbie and Mikey do not see or understand how awful this is. They believe this is a normal occurrence. If they misbehave, sometimes I'll ask, ""what do you think is an appropriate punishment?"" Sometimes they'll say no TV/toys, but a few times they'll say ""we won't get to eat?"" And I'd always ask where they heard that from or why they thought that was a good punishment. They would never tell me. We initially wanted to get the therapist involved so that the children can form their OWN opinions instead of being manipulated by Samantha. We want them to be able to build problem solving skills, express their feelings openly without fear, and we want them to understand that what is morally right or wrong, REMAINS right and wrong, even if it's their mom doing it. We just want them to be healthy and happy overall. But now, we want all that, and we want this to stop and we want full custody. While Mikey is hesitant, we are sure this will come out to the therapist eventually. If it doesn't come from Mikey, Robbie will tell the truth without fault. But we're concerned because Samantha wants them back in June. If there are no findings, we have no choice but to give them back, and are afraid that this will continue. 

It should be noted that Samantha has attempted suicide when she was pregnant with Robbie. Because bf is in the military, therapy was mandated, but she didn't feel like she needed it and stopped going. That along with the divorce, not being where she wants to be financially, struggling in school and not being able to provide for the kids the way she wants, may have put a lot of stress on her which has caused her to act this way. We have no idea, but we do know, that she does not cope well with her emotions, or losing control. She threatened to take the kids back once, because they accidentally called her by my name and she was convinced we were trying to make them forget her. 

I honestly have so many crazy stories, but for now we're concerned about this issue. What if nothing happens? If something does happen and we are granted custody (even if temporary), what can we do about Mikey since he is not biologically bf's? Bio dad has only seen him a handful of times. Bf has been in his life since BIRTH. Samantha's mom lives in the same state as her and would be next of kin, but she's a lawyer and doesn't like being around kids so she would just give Mikey to us. Samantha will also be living with her mom starting this month, so Mikey living with her would not be the best option. Are we doing the right thing and are we doing enough? We just can't allow them to go back if this is what's happening, but we don't want to risk losing Mikey. We are willing to adopt if it's even brought up that they'd be split up. I may be missing some info, so please ask! 

TL;DR:

azlog5,Do non physical abusers ever change?,"After realizing over a year ago that my 9 year marriage was verbally, emotionally, and spiritually abusive, I began working on emotional detachment. I’m isolated and a SAHM and my DH has narc tendencies. The cycle of happiness/relief, escalation, and an incident happened over and over until one day he tried to shove open a door I had locked and caused me a very minor injury while making an intimidating comment. Since that time he has promised to change, cried profusely, and demonstrated weeks of “good behavior,” as well as accepting the in home separation I’ve established. My faith and community are strongly against divorce and it’s almost logistically impossible for me to leave, but neither of those things would stop me if I was fully convinced I wasn’t safe. The thing is, I’m just questioning myself over and over and wondering, can he actually change? He’s had months of good behavior before reverting to abuse in the past, but this time seems different. And I’m having trouble coping. I feel depressed because if he’s “good” now that just means I’m stuck. But I have no feelings for him anymore. I feel like I’m almost addicted to the cycle that was happening for so long. I was desperate to fix things but now I feel like my trust can never be restored, but also that I’m the bad person for giving up.

azo4ik,DV success story,"I just want to say to anyone reading this who is suffering from dv or sex trafficking, it does and can have a happy ending. If you are real with yourself and dont give up. Once I realized I had to do whatever I could to get away from my perpetrator forever, I went down a hard and scary road with no one there for me.

Please do whatever you can to get out of your situation. I did not want to have another child with him but I had no resources to leave unless I was pregnant. As soon as I knew I was I was able to ho to my city's family shelter system. From there on out it was the fight of my life to never talk to him again no matter what.

Even when I had to leave my newborn in the hospital untim the authorities decided the next day that I really had had nothing to do with him since I left, I kept away from him and he never found out from me he had a fine healthy boy.

Then a year later I was given one of my girls back. My mom wont let my oldest go, which is something he knew would happen.

But I am thrilled to say here that as of tomorrow I will be on solid ground finally. I am finally getting the apartment I am entitled to get, because when you do everything they say you actually get somewhere in life. They said stay away from him go to dv groups take randoms, I did. 

Turns out I dont do weed laced with pcp like he said. I am also a great mom. Tomorrow I finally get a 3 bedroom apartment in a neighborhood where people pay 10xs what will pay to live there. The lease is mine for life.

I've gone from my family refusing to help me leave him so they could take my kids, to leaving him finally on my own pregnant with only a suitcase, to tomorrow schlepping a pile of stuff and 2 kids to our home.

b01nhf,"Concerned for my sister, advice?","This is my first time posting and recently started following this thread.

I am posting in hopes of getting some feedback from people who have been through this and may be able to offer some advice/support.

I am the older sister (27) and my younger sister is 23. She started dating this boy (22) I want to say about a year ago and right away he moved into my mother's house with my sister. While this may be a red flag, it doesn't surprise me because my mother is pretty non-authoritative and has basically no rules.

The abuse first became apparent to me back in November when my mom said my sister had gone to the hospital with her bf in the middle of the night because ""she did not feel well"". This immediately sounded suspicious to me and it turned out that he had either punched her or threw something at her and she had a black eye. When I had seen her the following day, she said it was an accident, but I don't think it was... My intuition told me otherwise. Obviously concerned I brought it to my mothers attention and she said she didn't know what I was talking about... I said ""did you not notice that her eye is black and blue?"" I made a huge deal out of it did lots of research online, tried to talk to my sister let her know that no one should be laying there hands on her or throwing anything at her. She seemed receptive but  then was back with him acting like everything was right as rain.

Fast forward to this past Friday, I get a frantic text message from her good friend that he had just punched her in face because she had posted a picture on social media with another guy from work when she had gone out bowling with coworkers. Again, not okay.
I called my mother and I say what is going on... She says ""I don't know"" and I hear my sister crying in the background. Knowing this is not this first incident I am again bringing to my mother's attention, she shows little concern and acts as if this is some inconvenience to her, 'it's getting late' 'I'm tired' etc.
The following day... They're going to out to dinner and everything is peachy keen. 

After confronting my mother about what is going on, we ended up getting into an argument and she comes up with these ridiculous reasons as to why I shouldn't be concerned. ""They always fight""  or ""she was so drunk"" etc. Etc. She tells me I'm overthinking again or stop psychoanalyzing. 

I am just baffled by the lack of concern and feel so upset / angry. I think what is most frustrating is that I can't make my sister leave him and it is utterly heartbreaking to watch her go back to him. 

Prob should have said this in the beginning but my mother was also in a D/V  relationship for 20 years which my sister and I both grew up in but that's a whole other story. Maybe that makes it even more painful... To watch it continue into the next generation and feel helpless and watch someone you love be treated badly all over again.

b030vq,Is healing a possibility? Can we move forward?,"Little background info, my wife and I have been married for 3 years and together for 7. When we first began dating we were long distance and when fights would occur they were get heated but it was easy to just stop answering or texting back... fast forward about 8 months, she is pregnant and moving across states to be with me so we can raise a family. Once we are in person, the fighting was still there and much harder to avoid... it would start off small, then snowball into something huge to the point where she would push me or throw something at me and also verbally abuse me, calling me the worst things she could think of and telling me things like “you’ll never meet your daughter I’m leaving” and things that are in that same ballpark. Things stayed like that for majority of the pregnancy, but almost completely subsided once our daughter was born and she went on antidepressants. We would have the occasional fight, usually when she would stop taking her meds for whatever reason, and it would always go back to that physical and verbal place - throwing things at me and shoving me, and back to the same verbal abuse... again, it would subside and things would be good, but there was always that fear that she would stop taking her meds... when would it happen again? Is our daughter safe in that environment? Beyond mentally, which it isn’t okay, is she physically safe? I was scared. 

That brings us to last year around this time. Things were stable, for the most part. My own depression got pretty out of hand after a very close cousin of mine was sent home on hospice, just waiting to die from cancer. My depression manifested in weird ways, very suicidal and always fearing impending doom... I would hurt myself, never anyone else. My wife was pretty supportive through my cousin’s decline and eventual death, but was struggling to be there for me the way I needed during my depression. 

A whole slew of things happened and eventually she stopped taking her medication... queue the pattern... huge fights, name calling, shoving, throwing things at me, but now she started to also hit me. I am fully capable of defending myself and would protect myself from any real physical harm, but the emotional and mental harm was unbearable. I told her so many times after things would calm down that it had to stop, she couldn’t be behaving that way and that I wasn’t going to allow it any longer... she kept calling my bluff. We kept fighting, things were awful, and she kept on with her abusive pattern. I don’t want to relive the details, but the worst of it was when she threw a set of keys at my face and hit me just above the eye leaving an actual mark for the first time ever. I was terrified and angry and sad. I told her it could not, and would not, happen again. That I would leave if it did. She called my bluff again. Pushed me, shoved me, name calling... 

I can’t even remember how many times this happened over the course of a few months. It was fairly frequent. Through working with my own therapist I was eventually able to learn to set a firm boundary and I told her that if it happened again, instead of leaving, I would call the cops. Through our couples therapist we learned to put in a safe word for if a fight was getting out of hand. One afternoon a fight was beginning to get out of hand. I told her we needed to stop and I used the safe word... “pineapple”. She kept going and going and wouldn’t stop or calm down, I could see the writing on the wall, I knew what was going to happen. I kept saying “pineapple” over and and over again and she wouldn’t listen. She was blind with rage. She cornered me in the bedroom as I was trying to get some dirty laundry, I needed a distraction and I chose cleaning. She punched me multiple times, pushed me into the wall, was calling me all the names in the book and explaining to me how much she hated me. Meanwhile I am shouting “pineapple”.

I was finally able to get out of the small bedroom, laundry in hand. I go to the laundry room, which is in the kitchen of our tiny home, and she follows me out, continuing to verbally abuse me. I choose to ignore it and go about my distraction of doing laundry. As I try to get out of the kitchen she picked up the dining room chair and was preparing to throw it at me. I told her boldly that I was calling the cops. I pulled out my phone, dialed 911, and then she finally hit the pause button and understood what was happening - that I wasn’t bluffing this time. 

She instantly freaked out, said I couldn’t do this to her, that I was going to get her arrested, that I was going to ruin her life. I ignored all of that. I didn’t feel guilt or shame in what I was doing. I was proud of myself for finally sticking up for me. The police did not arrest her, however they informed her that if there was ever another call she would be taken regardless of what I said or wanted. 

Since then the abuse has stopped. This was in November, roughly 5 months ago. My own therapist explained to me that my feedback was not working, however the consequences seems to have gotten the severity of it into her head. I can see the logic between feedback and consequence, and I do think that hit home for her, but obviously my fear is still there. Despite things being good, I am afraid for myself at times and afraid of what happens if we fight. 

My question is, can we ever move forward? I want to trust her so badly, I want to believe that this put the fear of god in her... I want to believe that we can have a stable marriage. Is it a possibility?? I have never been a victim and do not know any - is growth a possibility? Is there any chance to rebuild? Is there hope?",restlessXghosts,2019-03-11 20:36:58,8,1078,29.3,46.66,65.98,2.07,15.62,15.31,93.41,60.3,21.24,14.75,8.81,1.58,0.19,3.99,0.19,6.49,4.82,12.62,10.02,5.66,7.42,1.67,21.06,3.53,1.21,1.48,0.93,1.67,6.31,1.67,4.45,1.11,1.48,0.65,11.04,1.11,0,4.45,0,12.24,2.13,0.83,3.62,3.15,1.21,3.06,1.58,0.37,0.56,0.65,2.23,0.65,1.3,0.19,0.28,8.81,2.6,0.93,1.95,1.39,1.95,7.98,7.61,1.48,17.07,3.53,6.86,7.7,0.93,0.19,1.3,0,0.19,0.28,0.19,0.09,0,0.09,0,0,15.86,7.51,5.1,0,0,1.02,0,0.28,0.74,1.21,0,0
b03gn2,Found a yahooanswers q off me aged 11 about my parents. My mom has died now.,"It just randomly came to my mind. Don’t know how. I completely blocked it out that I even wrote post online asking for help from strangers about my dad and mom. It’s so fricking sad. I can’t believe how sad it is. I disnt realise at the time but I was 11 years old, I just feel so fking sorry for my younger self. It’s so unfair. She has passed away now. 6 years in December. Doesn’t seem real still. It was the daily sadness and torture she went through that deteriorated her. She may have developed an illness but she said herself, “Has anyone ever thought to consider that my heart is 3x the size it is now because your dad scares the sh*t out of me every day, so much that I can’t breathe, I hide behind doors, cry into towels so nobody hears me, just because I don’t want my kids to have no dad.” Now she’s gone.

b046c2,Flashbacks,"I've never posted here except in response to others because I simply wanted to help others who felt what I did or to understand how I felt.  I don't know why I decided I would post this tonight as I have had many flashbacks but I guess I decided it was just time.  I dated a man that stalked and abused me for a year and a half.  I finally ran away when he grabbed me by the throat and rammed my head against the wall until I passed out.  I thought I was going to die.  There were many times before where he had thrown me against walls, broke my ribs, put bruises on me and not once.  The worst things he did were not physical though; they were mental and emotional.  He threatened multiple times to record me naked or us having sex(at a certain point I just did this to placate him) saying he was going to post the videos on sites and use those sites against me in some sort of weird custody thing against my daughter.  The whole time I was terrified that he was going to kill me or hurt my daughter if I didn't do what he said to do.  I was his slave.  I cleaned his house, did his work when I could for his employer (our work overlapped), and payed his bills.  I did whatever I could to keep him calm including lying about needing more ADHD meds so he could take the excess and snort them up.    I don't know how to heal from this.  I've tried and am still trying.  I just want some peace but sometimes I think people want to hurt rather than heal.  I don't understand that.  I have had hyper awareness for several years.  It's not as bad as it was but it still happens occasionally.  Like I said I just want it to stop.  I know my mind shifted into protection mode when he kept me awake for 4 days straight(I've never been right after that) and all the sudden my world changed to ""Everything is a threat or a hint(to make him not beat you up)."" I just don't know how to stop that feeling.  Thanks for reading.  I am married to a great guy now and have gotten my life back together for the most part I just felt like sharing in case anyone was interested.  I hope this helps someone.  It helped me.",Carter4026,2019-03-11 22:49:57,3,416,15.2,14.51,91.73,18.67,16,12.26,95.43,62.26,24.52,18.03,12.74,0.48,0.24,4.09,0.48,6.49,3.61,12.74,10.1,6.73,7.69,2.64,23.08,4.57,2.64,2.88,0.72,2.64,5.77,2.64,3.12,0.72,1.2,0.72,9.62,0.72,0.24,0.48,4.57,17.31,3.61,2.16,2.88,3.85,1.2,5.53,2.88,0.24,0.72,1.68,2.16,0.96,0.96,0.48,0,6.25,1.68,1.2,1.92,0.72,1.68,9.62,9.86,1.2,14.42,1.92,5.53,6.73,0.96,0.24,0.24,0.48,0,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.78,6.01,0.96,0,0.24,0,0,0,0.48,2.16,1.92,0
b04vs5,"Boyfriend choked, spat in my face, and whipped me","Hes an alcoholic and ive been financially supporting him for months. Im at the hospital now for a checkup and sleeping pills, and i didnt press charges but hes no longer in my home. I still love him and want him to be a better man, but i know im being not smart. I'm all over the place and need support. It started with him throwing shit around. Then he slapped my hand cos he thought I burned him with a cig on purpose. I tried to apologize profusely and he looked over my head (he's rly tall) and ignored me, then left me on the train. He got off when i got on and the doors closed. Then said shh the rugby's on when I found him at  the bar. Then one night we had a fight and I refused to give him his lighter cos I had bought him it and wanted it back, and then he grabbed my bag and pushed me on the floor. Another time he threw my things again and chased me around, so I hit him, and then he trapped me on my bed slapping me. Hes also burnt my hand with a cigarette looking into my eyes. I have never hit him except for self defence. He also smacks things out of my hand so hard and when I tell him it scares me, he says it was just stuff he smacked and he didn't smack me and I've hit him too. The last assault was when I took him in after the police had removed him from his family home for drunken behaviour. I tried to comfort him, he calls me a useless fake bitch, and then just goes to town on me. Following me around, slapping me, holding me down to spit into my face and make sure it got into my face. He held me down and strangled me and I feared for my life. I called the police and gave him a chance to leave and said I dont want to ruin your life I just want u to go and I won't even tell them you did anything. He left. Then he kicked down my door and came back in to hit me in the side of the head, ribs. When the cops finally arrived I was on my my bed in fetal position because he was whipping me in the face and body with a leather strap he had ripped off my bag, and broke my skin. He slept under my house and came back the next day so I called his friends and they agreed to come help me find a place for him to stay. Even then he was mad I told his friends and tried to leave him at someone's house and then insisted his friends came back to mine in case he returned, cos he can break down my door if he wants. He insisted on being brought back to mine and I noticed he was grumpy and then he started calling me a fake bitch. I was just nice to him until he agreed to leave the next day at 3am. I also forgot to mention I didn't even make eye contact and I was aware my crying was making him more mad cos he called me a pussy and mimicked me so I spoke in a very calm voice and I swear I didnt do anything to add to his anger, apart from tried to kick him in the balls cos he broke an umbrella and waved the sharp end at me. Earlier he said he wanted to stab his father. I thought he was going to kill me or my dog. I just need support. I am not ashamed to say I love him and I fear he will kill himself. I just want someone who understands how it is to mourn the love of ur life u thought u knew and u were going to marry, at the same time as having suffered trauma at his hands.",semi_god,2019-03-12 00:23:11,15,688,19.78,51.74,58.17,6.42,20.85,10.17,94.77,63.08,26.45,24.13,12.94,0.15,1.02,9.74,0.29,2.33,4.94,12.65,6.1,5.38,11.05,1.45,18.75,3.49,1.16,1.02,0.15,0.58,5.81,2.03,3.78,0.58,1.45,1.02,15.99,0.44,0.73,0,10.17,7.27,1.45,1.6,1.45,1.02,0.44,1.74,3.34,0.58,1.02,1.74,5.09,3.05,1.31,0.15,0.73,5.38,1.6,0.87,2.33,0.87,0,9.45,6.69,2.33,17.3,2.76,9.16,6.1,0.44,0.73,1.45,0.29,0,0.44,1.31,0.58,0.73,0,0,0,8.72,4.65,2.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.16,0.29,0

I didn't really think shoving him with my girly arms would do anything to him lol, but he punched me square in my jaw and now I have a bruise there.

b07736,my story (in poem form),"i knew it was too soon, 
but when i was with u
i felt like all my wishes came true 
i jumped in this shit head first 
like intercourse
relationship wasn’t worth shit 
yet i paid the cost 
i’ll never forget all the pain and neglect
even after you hit me i still forgave to forget 
master manipulator 
i should’ve anticipated 
the you i first met
that ain’t you any more
whenever you get upset 
you start banging all on your chest
as i sit there feeling helpless and in distress
it was never really you that i was afraid of 
i was more afraid of you fucking up the relationship 
to the point of no return 
damn was i dumb
eventually i’d learn 
nothing would change 
i almost had a fit
trynna worship the ground you walk on 
now time has passed 
and you see what you’ve missed and slept on
i’ll never forget all the shit i dealt wit
gave you everything 
and you (literally) just spit in my face ...
i could’ve made your abusive ass catch a case
gave you time to change 
and i think that was my biggest mistake 
hesitant to leave cause of what you might do 
expose me, stalk me, hurt me or worse ...
i wouldn’t put it past you
but i ain’t even mad about it 
i just know that you will never change 
and that’s what’s sad bout it
always acted like my dad
or tried to put me down 
and i hated it
“wya?”
“who are you with?”
“you can’t wear that, you stupid fucking bitch” 
one day i’d finally had enough
thinking bout everything i lost because of you 
shit is tough 
like what the fuck 
was i never enough 
is that why you roughed me up?
how can someone make you so happy at first 
but so miserable toward the end ? 
how can someone claim they love you so much
but really want to bash your head in? 
and even through all that 
i still had your back
lied to your mom 
and hid it from mine 
“babe, just cover it up with makeup. you’re fine”
physically, emotionally and mentally.. 
 you hurt me ...
FOR THE VERY LAST TIME
you took me for granted 
and you took advantage 
but my mind and heart &amp; soul
are as STRONG as can be
and that is one thing
you could never take from me

b0agqz,Abused online for years after getting RO - venting,"My husband's ex/stalker/abuser has been harassing us for years. We have court coming up next week to renew the RO and so I've been on edge. I've been wanting to write a post here for a while but the whole thing is so intense, complex, and emotionally triggering I don't know where to start. To make a long story short, she abused him physically, verbally and sexually while they were in a relationship 6 years ago. He had to literally flee and secretly get on a flight to get away from her. He flew to his parents home a few states away and she followed him, stalked him, harassed him and made many violent threats, and broke into his parents' home. He had to change his phone number and other contact info like email. She continued to harass him online via social media and stalk him at his parents house. Within a few months he was granted a 5 year restraining order. His parents and siblings were also protected under the order.   


Since the RO was granted she stopped physically stalking him which is awesome, there have been a few times she tweeted @ him and we made police reports. She has made it her mission to destroy him in any ""gray"" area she feels she can circumvent the RO or law. She goes on to social media in an attempt to ruin his business and sway his customers by making it seem like he was the abuser and she made up a story about him knocking her teeth out (which she has zero evidence for but internet randos believe it, even though the judge didn't buy it) . She literally DMs customers of his business every day or any publication that writes about his business to try and defame him. She comments everywhere she can saying that people should not support his business because he abused her and then ""silenced"" her by getting an RO against her. It's upsetting because people actually believe her. She is inciting third party harassment and tells other people to harass him, or to beat him up ""for what he did"" etc (we have evidence of this in livestream videos she's done and are bringing the videos to court next week).  


I guess I'm just venting because I don't have anyone to talk to about this who understands. It's fucking disgusting and enraging that she has twisted everything, she's already taken everything from him and then even takes away his ability to be believed as a victim of domestic violence and abuse. My hope is that the judge will order her to stop talking about him or his business on public forums/social media under the argument that what she has done was derogatory, threatened violence, are said in retaliation against him getting an RO (we have tweets of her saying this). But I'm unsure of what will happen because of 1st amendment. Also hoping the RO is renewed for life instead of only 5 years so we don't need to do this again.",black_opals,2019-03-12 10:26:01,9,518,38.34,94.1,1,1,22.52,18.73,89.96,57.72,20.46,15.25,1.74,1.16,0,12.16,0.19,5.21,4.83,13.71,9.85,4.25,8.11,0.97,18.34,2.7,0.77,1.35,0.97,1.54,5.98,0.97,5.02,0.77,3.47,0.39,20.46,1.16,0.19,5.41,6.95,10.62,2.12,2.51,0.97,2.51,0.77,3.09,1.93,0.58,0.97,0.19,1.16,0.19,0.58,0.39,0,9.65,3.67,0.58,3.28,1.35,1.35,5.6,10.62,1.35,12.93,1.93,5.41,4.83,2.32,0.58,0.77,1.54,0,0,0.58,0.19,0,0.19,0,0,12.74,4.25,2.51,0,0,0,0,0.19,1.16,2.7,1.16,0.77

b0gk0y,How long do you have to report domestic abuse in NC?,My wife and I are helping her sister out of an abusive relationship and we've convinced her to take it to the police to hopefully prevent or slow him from ever doing it to someone else again. She was smart so shes been sort of easing her way out so its not like he hit her yesterday but she does have pictures of her previous injuries. We just want to make sure its still something she can do. I don't think that kind of crime really has a statute of limitations but I just want to be sure. I wouldn't want to get into a situation where she basically has to relive this abuse by telling the police for nothing to happen.

b0na0c,r/relationships redirected me here... Boyfriend makes me question my sanity - long,"I (F35) have been with my boyfriend (M25) for three years now. Our backgrounds are very different, my parents are very successful and still married, he comes from a broken home where nobody is educated beyond high school, I hold two MA degrees, he never went to college. He was a waiter when I met him, now he makes websites for my clients.

This worried me a bit and he was also scared, so we tried not to get involved for about half a year, but we were just crazy about each other. Being a person who always thinks when there is a will there is a way, I decided to give it a go. One year into the relationship he moved in with me, and we've been living together for 2 years now. I've been paying for everything until about a half a year ago when he started making some money, but barely enough to cover utilities. He does hand over all this money to me for bills, and never asked me for money for anything. I simply feed and clothe us, he has no demands, and also seems quite embarrassed when I buy him shoes for example.

The problem is - he is unbelievably lazy and unmotivated and it keeps getting worse. I should mention that we are both very attractive people and I look much younger than I am, no one suspects that there is any age difference, let alone 10 years, so no, I am not putting up with him because I have no options - I do have options and on paper they are all better than him. However, I love him. But, I can't reason with him or have a proper conversation.

With time, he gained about 60 pounds, started sleeping all the time and playing video games at night. He snores like the walls will collapse. He creates CHAOS around the house. He eats so much that every night my kitchen is so dirty like I catered for ten people. Trash is everywhere. Sink is clogged every morning, full of water and oil to the brink, with dirty dishes and trash in it. It's complete insanity. He will sleep until 5 pm sometimes. If he gets up earlier, he will take like 5 naps during the day. It's impossible to talk about this to him. He's become kind of aggressive - he refuses to talk and if I press him, he yells at me to leave him alone, even called me a bitch a couple weeks ago. I kicked him out, he refused to take his things which I packed, and then proceeded to cry and whine about how much he loves me. I tried to compromise, by saying he will have to spend half the time at his dad's and half the time here, but a week fast forward everything is the same. I begged him to unclog the sink for 4 days he was free, and NOTHING. Excuses. On day 4, I googled how to do it and did it, all in 60 seconds.

He obviously has anger issues. He got drunk a couple of times, had a total FIT, attacked complete strangers at a festival, called me a whore and threw me against a wall even though I never did absolutely anything to warrant it. And I mean, I never exchanged a glance or a message with some other guy since I've known him. I was completely petrified, but my psychologist friend convinced me it can be just alcohol and he will be fine as long as he doesn't drink. He never had a drop of alcohol in almost 2 years now. He was ok for awhile, but now he has this thing where he will still get into fights with strangers in a bar SOBER because someone was ""looking at him"". He never hit me, but if I try to talk to him about problems he will either cry or yell at me, or ignore me.

The worst part is that he is making me question my sanity. He pretends like I am making shit up to fight. Downplaying everything, as if I haven't been going on about this for a year now. Telling him I'm unhappy, telling him I can't live in a pigsty, begging him to find out what he wants to do in life, offering to help, asking him to go see a professional about his anger issues (his mother cheated on his father and generally doesn't give a shit about him or sister, I paid for his sister's school, ex girlfriends were all sketchy and pretty trashy), so I think his issues stem from this. When I start a conversation, he plays dumb, downplays everything to hell with remarks like ""so what is the problem, that I slept in for ONCE?? That I didn't wash dishes ONCE?? Then he CRIES because I ""hurt him"". No I don't call him names or humiliate him, I just make demands that he pull his weight.

He is otherwise very affectionate and committed, never cheated on me, doesn't go out much, doesn't stay out late etc. He is practically at my house 24/7, littering...

If anyone has advice beyond ""dump him"", I would appreciate the world out of it. Thank you for reading this.

b0us4m,One Year Anniversary,"Today is the one year anniversary of my independence. The anniversary of the best, worst and scariest day of my life. The day I chose “Me” over “Us” and goddamn if I didn’t feel as if I was the most selfish bitch. I remember the breakup like it was yesterday. Ugly, vicious, terrifying. I couldn’t say another word after blurting out the only two I needed him to hear “I’m leaving”. At first he was in shock as if I hadn’t already tried to leave him four times before. Then came the “I’m sorry”, “I’ll do better” and empty promises. When that didn’t work he tried to drag me to bed and force sex. When I fought back and broke free then came rage. This consisted of him shouting and taking his anger out on walls and objects within reach. This was where he expressed that I was crazy, that he didn’t know who I was, that I had made a promise to him to not break his heart and now look what I was doing, that I’m a runner and that I was going to be miserable without him . He was quite adamant I was going to be miserable for the rest of my life.  And at the time it did feel wrong to be abandoning him in the square bedroom that was our little world, my cage and his dominion.  But the feelings I had from the moment I no longer recognized myself in the mirror were starting to fester. The young 20 year old from before was screaming to be let out. It felt as if my soul was split in two. “He said he was sorry- stay it’ll be okay-you’re over reacting- just tell him you’re sorry so he’ll be happy again” vs “free yourself -you deserve better-this isn’t what love should look like- WAKE UP -LEAVE” . I was fighting a war on two fronts that day and I didn’t know what was going to happen after I left. It will be the scariest thing you will ever do but ladies it’s worth it. A year later, I moved in with my bestie, reconnected with friends and family, found my sense of adventure again, became my own person, found my laughter again and found what love should really look like.  I am far from miserable. So to the chapter with my ex I can gladly say “Thank you, Next” . ——Happy Independence to me.",Scr3amrElla,2019-03-13 19:19:04,18,412,27.39,34.88,89.11,3.13,16.48,11.17,95.87,60.68,21.84,15.78,9.71,0.49,1.46,4.13,0,6.07,5.1,13.35,12.86,3.64,7.04,2.43,22.33,8.01,4.61,1.94,1.94,0.73,10.68,4.13,6.55,1.46,2.18,2.18,10.68,0.24,0.49,0.24,4.37,10.68,3.16,1.21,1.94,1.7,0.73,3.88,3.88,0.97,1.7,0.97,1.94,0.49,0.49,0.24,0.24,5.83,1.7,1.94,1.46,1.21,0.49,10.68,9.22,2.43,17.72,2.67,6.55,8.74,0.24,0.97,0.73,0.73,0.24,0.24,0.97,0.49,0,0.24,0,0,18.69,5.83,3.4,0,0,0,0,1.7,3.88,3.88,0,0

He has not physically hurt- well he has hit me before, thrice when he was drunk and once when he was sober and angry with me. But he is emotionally and verbally abusive overall to me and my sister,  he is the same towards our mother but he's more physical towards her. 

I gave no fucks at all when he was tearing up after he was handcuffed because he didn't care all those times I cried, he'd tell me to shut the fuck up. 

I'm hoping my mom doesn't allow him to come back with us after this court thing we have tomorrow.  I have been done with him.

b0x7a3,My Little Brother and My Father,"So, this is story is pretty tame to the other ones I have read here, as in no physical violence at all. No violence in general, really. However, I need someone or something to speak to, and get this off my chest...here we go. If this isn't the right place for this, please point me to somewhere I may share this story.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my Dad has just been accused, by my little brother, of hitting him and being generally physically abusive when he was younger. The only reason I know of this, is because I heard him crying into my Dad's arms, quite loudly, and I jumped out of my bed to see what is going on. He was crying because my Father offered to move out, if that would make my little brother feel better. (It's around 11 PM here, and this happened maybe 30 minutes ago.) However, neither I nor my Dad have any recollection whatsoever of this happening, and as a reference, I am 19 and my little brother is 17. The only time I can remember my father ever ""beating"" us, or me, was when I was super young, and I got a dope-slap on the ass after I did something to deserve it. That's it, no paddles or drum-sticks or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can imagine, my Dad and I were distraught over this accusation for various reasons, and when questioning my little brother further we found out that most of my little brothers fear of my father, he doesn't know where it came from, though I think he still holds physical violence as the main reason. However, it does paint a light on some of his most recent behavior, that of locking his door the entire time he's awake, and only unlocking it when he was forced to by my parents when he goes to bed, in case anything happens and we need to get him up quick.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, though, I am pretty sure that the door-locking thing was just because he wanted privacy, and didn't want anyone coming into his room without his permission. This makes more sense instead of the fear theory, because I think he would've pushed harder for locking his door at night, when I think he would be the most fearful. That's not too say my father is never angry, and when he gets angry he gets terrifying, but he has never accompanied that anger with physical violence against myself or my little brother.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I need some savy redditors to help me figure out what the hell is happening here, because as it is, I am confused, angry, and worried. On one hand, if this isn't true and is just a way for my brother to get out of doing something that wound of way out of control, I am a little bit pissed at my brother, for making my father, who has actually teared up in the past over the implication that he would harm us, go through this. On the other hand, if it is true, why the hell do neither I, my Father, or my Mother ever remember this happening? I am not expecting a slew of answers tonight, and I am probably only going to stay up for maybe another hour or two, but...I need some help.",Dons3,2019-03-14 00:02:37,0,573,17.18,26.49,83.63,3.74,27.29,15.71,93.72,61.26,21.99,13.96,9.08,0.87,0.17,3.84,0,7.85,3.84,12.57,8.9,7.5,9.6,2.62,16.93,5.41,3.14,2.09,1.05,2.27,5.41,1.57,3.84,1.22,1.4,0.35,10.82,3.84,0,0.17,7.33,19.02,3.32,2.62,2.62,6.46,1.57,5.76,1.92,0.35,0.7,0.7,1.92,1.05,0.87,0,0,6.28,3.32,0.35,1.92,1.22,0,4.01,10.82,1.05,15.18,2.09,8.38,4.89,0.17,0.35,1.05,0,0.35,0,1.05,0.7,0.35,0,0,0,19.37,4.36,9.08,0,1.4,0.17,0,0.52,0.35,1.75,0.35,1.4
b0y45p,Update on the abuse I didn't detail in my first post,"This is my initial post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/b0na0c/rrelationships\_redirected\_me\_here\_boyfriend\_makes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/b0na0c/rrelationships_redirected_me_here_boyfriend_makes/)

  
I am making a new post, I hope this is how it's done on reddit. I didn't go into much detail about the two times he got drunk and abusive, as he never drank or did it again in years. It was actually all-night torture. Both times began with well... nothing. No fight, nothing of the sort. He would just drink until he started acting aggressive. Then he would start calling me a whore, he even said ""you fucked XX"" - XX is his friend whom I DON'T EVEN KNOW. When he sobered up he cried and told me his ex girlfriend cheated with his friend ages ago...And this was some childish shit, they were all like 15, so 10 years ago, he was maybe with her for two weeks.

On those two occasions, he also strangled me (not too hard or to long, it wasn't painful, but it was scary as hell. He first strangled me with his hands, I managed to wiggle out and he kicked me in the back. As I fell over he proceeded to strangle me from behind with a shirt then just let me go), broke half my belongings, spat in my face, broke all the doors in the house because I was running away and locking myself in rooms to get away from him. When he opened all the windows, I got terrified that my cat will jump out a window and get hurt, so I ran over all the glass he broke to get the cat and my feet were all cut up. At this point (let's call him Mike), I started pleading ""Mike, I don't deserve this, please remember who I am, please help me"". I was limping holding the cat and there was blood everywhere. He looked up at me, kind of smirking, and said ""There is no Mike"". This was something straight out of a horror movie to me. He also stared into a corner of our bedroom, where there is nobody, and I can't think of anyone in our lives he could be referring to and said to me ""You and this whore are conspiring to kill me"", like there was a woman there, but there was no one there?!

For the first part, I was bewildered and attempted to reason with him. When I got scared for the cat and got my feet cut up, I got angry. He then went on to attempt and break my computers (I am a designer, my entire work we both live off is in those computers), and that's when I lost it and took a kitchen knife and stood by the computers kind of poking the knife in the air so he could't get to them, or me, or the cat - saying ""you will not do this to me"". Now he likes to remember that I pulled a knife on him, so I must be insane too... I never went after him or went toward him with the knife, I just stood my ground where I was, trying to keep him away. 

I then called his dad in the middle of the night who said ""he would help me if he was closer"", he lives about a 20 minute drive from us. Bf yelled ""who are you calling you whore"", snatched the phone from my hand and threw me against the wall, I bashed my head. 

I called my friend, the psychologist, who came around at like 6 am, after an entire night of this chaos, calmed him down and took him to his dad's. He (the psychologist) convinced me this is alcohol psychosis and everything will be fine as long as he doesn't drink. He never drank a drop again, so I kind of buried all this as bad memories, but I can't truly let it go. I know he was crazy drunk, but I still lived through it.

I pleaded with his parents to help me. His mom played nice for two days and ""worried about me"", then asked for money on day three... His dad is a nice guy who just seems to have no spine and ""doesn't want to hurt his ego"". His 20 yo sister was on my side, she took it really hard, yelled at him about being a piece of shit, an egomaniac, told him (about me) ""Do you know what this woman's done for us?? You don't deserve her. You deserve some crack whore, you asshole"", and she cried and hugged me and begged me to leave him.

My dad is great but he knows nothing about this, and my dad is not to be fucked with either. I sometimes think this is the reason he never hit me, because he knows hell would come down on him.

I am an only child, my parents have a good marriage, but my mother is a textbook narcissist (she always makes up worst case scenarios and does her own share of gaslighting and making everything about her, so I can't even talk to her about this), and I've learned to handle her over the years, not feed into her, but I do have abandonment issues and problems discerning right from wrong when it comes to how people treat me. I don't have these problems when it comes to people I care about, my friends see me as the tough one and probably wouldn't believe what I allowed to happen to me. I hate seeing myself as a victim of either mom or my boyfriend, I feel kind of bad even writing all of this and ""blaming"" them. I go from telling myself ""suck it up, nobody has it perfect"", to ""damn, you shouldn't let ANYONE treat you like this"".

TL;DR: I am hoping for some encouragement and clarity from people who went through similar things, and also thoughts if I should worry about this as he stopped drinking and never drank or repeated this in the last two years.

b13aiq,Getting triggered back to abuse in fights with new SO. Has anyone experienced this?,"I'm f/23, I was in an abusive relationship for 3.5/4 years from 16-20. 

When I got out, I found myself in a new 'good' relationship. We never had any conflict. That relationship ended the beginning of last year. So 20-22.

I began seeing my best friend towards the end of the year, I didn't expect to find myself in a relationship. I really wasn't looking.

Two weeks ago, I found myself in a fight fight with him where I got triggered. I felt like I was in the midst of abuse. We had a disagreement, but I felt like I was being dismissed, invalidated and not listened to. 

I saw red. I lost it. I was screaming, calling him an asshole, trying to pack my bags to leave, I wanted to end the relationship. I couldn't deal with telling for him to stop talking, because he was relentlessly defending himself and I was getting too overwhelmed. He could've dealt with the situation much better, but I don't think he's abusive. Stubborn and insensitive. 

It was terrifying because it hasn't happened since the abuse ended roughly 3 years ago. 
It happened again today and I'm so exhausted.

I was wondering if any of you have dealt with this? How did you overcome it?",fauxuser01,2019-03-14 10:40:25,2,230,36.85,27.14,85.66,1,10.45,18.7,90.43,56.96,20.43,16.52,11.74,0.87,0.87,3.04,0,3.91,5.65,13.04,10,4.78,6.09,3.04,22.17,2.61,1.74,1.3,3.91,1.3,8.7,1.3,7.39,0.87,4.35,0.87,10.87,0,0.43,0,3.04,13.04,3.04,2.61,2.17,2.61,0.43,3.48,3.91,1.74,0.87,0.87,0.87,0.43,0.43,0,0,8.7,3.48,2.17,0.43,3.04,0.87,13.48,5.22,0.43,14.35,0.43,4.35,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,0.43,0,0,0,0,20.87,8.26,4.78,0,0,1.3,0,0.87,0,4.78,0,0.87
b18bvx,I thought I wanted this!,"My abusive dad is in jail right now, and his bond is $3,000. His parents don't know, and neither do his siblings. The only one who'd be able to pay his bond would be his younger brother. No one in my whole entire family knows except only my mom, sister, and close friend.  We feel safe and relieved.  But I feel so bad, it's kinda making me sick. I thought this was what I wanted. 

I don't get along with my dad at all or have a healthy relationship with him. Abuse and disrespect sums up his relationship with me. Before he got arrested, I would wish him to move far away from us or just for him to get his own damn place &amp; to leave us be. 

But now that he's actually in jail, and could possibly lose his job at the airport, I feel really sad for him. 

The thing is, I don't know if my dad would ever seriously hurt us, but it's in the back of my mind. He has  threatened to kill my mom, then me &amp; my younger sis, but he never followed through. I fear that if he were to be released &amp; if my mom allowed him back into our home... he could hurt all of us, just for putting him behind bars. I know my dad, and he does not let things go. 

I can't even believe I'm sitting here in Starbucks right now, while he's sitting in a jail cell somewhere downtown. 

I'm feeling fearful, annoyed, and sad. 
  
I wish we could live like this, just the three of us. But my mom says we need the car, we share one car and it's under his name. 

But fuck, dude, there's no way in hell I want him to come back here. I'll have to fight tooth and nail to convince my mom not to let come back if he ever gets released.  I don't want him to savagely beat her to death.. or even us.

b18hay,I need help and opinions,Hey everyone. I’m at a crossroad. My wife and I are 23. On one hand she’s a great mom to our two children and I do love her. On the other hand  she’s hit me before in the past in from of our kids (we have a 2 year old and a 5 month old). I go to school full time and work full time. Everything I do is for her. This has been building up for 2-3 years and I think I’ve hit a tipping point. I’m not confrontational. It’s just not in my nature. She’s hot headed and doesn’t think before she acts. I started my new career job two months ago. Long story short she thought I was cheating (I’ve never cheated in my life) or doing drugs( I had to take a drug test for my new job) at a random house she thought I was at since we have our location on the find friends app on iPhone. She went to that house saying that she knows I’m there blah blah blah. She has low self esteem long story short. We live at my moms house and my mom is a great woman and would never kick us out. I’m the only one working and she always wants to get a house or an apartment to get our own space. I told her we’re there until we can comfortably pay bills and be financially stable. She told me she wants a house and her parents did it so we can do it too. Huge fight  happens. I told her it’s best if she stays at her moms for awhile. She took the kids and it’s been hard. She told me I hit my kids and watch CP which is an attack on me. I would never do anything to hurt our children. She has zero proof of anything and she won’t allow the kids to spend the night over the house. I’m planning on going to the court house to start the divorce process Tomorrow. I want to see if you guys have anything information or opinions on the situation. She got a new job and starts Monday. We have the kids in daycare now she told me two days ago we should try to work things out even though I wanted to work things out long ago. I quit my second job for her and the kids to spend more time on the weekends. She was crying and balling her eyes out when I told her I think it’s in the best interest for the kids to get a divorce and she told me she did all those things because of stress and going to work and having the kids in daycare instead of watching them all day will fix things and get a lot of problems out of the way so we can focus on couples counseling etc. like I said I’m at a crossroads.

I've spoken to my boyfriend about what he did and he accepts that he was wrong for hitting me. He's promised to be better but I'm unsure whether to stay with him in case it happens again. Since we talked about it I remembered more stuff that he did to me and I've just been really down and it's getting in the way of my work for university.  It feels like my head is spinning right now. During summer a family member of mine passed away and I had to fly to New York for the funeral but even during that time he didn't stop questioning me about my past and it was horrible. On the day I met is family he started to get nervous and he was said ""I'm worried you were too much of a hoe before I met you"" and the same thing happened when he met my parents. He used to be addicted to prescription pills but gave them up once we got together and he knows i'll leave him if he does them again. But whenever we have a big argument he threatens to do drugs again.  He would criticise me over me over so many things and make me feel terrible about myself while saying he loved me and that it was supposed to make me a better person. Now I feel like I constantly have to prove myself to him because of the things he's said about me. He made it seem like everything was always my fault to the point I apologised for having sex with other people before I met him. 

After him getting physical and calling me names all the time I started to feel uncomfortable with having sex with him. This was to do with the fact that he berated me about sleeping with other people before him. He got mad and demanded sex saying he didn't want to be like an old married couple when he's only 21. One time right after we finished having sex he asked me a question about my past. He says he's going to be better but i don't know if he will and I'm super hesitant to move in with him right now.",UnfairSample,2019-03-15 10:00:48,9,424,24.91,67.29,59.25,8.74,24.94,12.03,95.75,62.26,25.47,20.28,10.61,0.94,0.47,7.78,0.47,5.19,3.3,16.04,10.61,6.37,6.6,0.71,22.64,4.95,3.3,1.18,0.71,1.18,5.19,1.89,3.3,1.89,0.94,0,17.92,0.94,0.71,0,8.49,10.85,2.83,1.42,1.18,2.59,1.42,3.3,2.36,0,1.42,0.94,2.83,0.47,1.18,0.94,0.24,9.91,4.48,1.18,2.12,1.89,1.42,9.2,11.32,1.18,14.62,1.89,4.48,8.25,0.47,0.94,0.94,0,0,0.24,2.12,0.24,1.89,0,0,0,20.28,4.72,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0.47,3.54,0.47,10.85

b1jqq1,Is this abuse?,"My dad has always been someone who gets angry easily and quickly. When he’s mad he’ll yell and break things. When I was younger he’d get mad over nothing (like not doing what he wanted to do or not getting his way) and start hitting my brother and I (slapping, kicking, punching, hitting us with belts etc.) He’d break our things and throw things at us (like shoes, bottles etc.) He’d call us names and put us down. When we’d cry or show any sign of being hurt he’d make fun of us. He tries to make my brother and I go against each other. He’s very manipulative and makes everyone think I’m a bad kid and he’s an angel. He never takes responsibility for what he does and always puts the blame on someone else for his actions. My dad has no control over his anger. Ex: he bought pizza and I don’t like the pizza (he knows I don’t) and when I said I wasn’t eating it, he took the pizza and threw it in the trash while calling my names. Then when I was sad at how he reacted he called me a baby. 

My mother and brother say it is not abuse but my father treats me worse than them. My friends say that it is physical and emotional abuse and that it isn’t normal since their parents don’t do that. I just want to know since my family always tells me that if I’d call the cops they wouldn’t do anything because I’m not beaten or neglected.

If we received a letter like that from our apartment office; before he got released, is it possible that the judge told him that he is not able to come back to our place either?

b1mkgp,How to get over abuse? It's been years.,"Long, long post. I hope this is okay to post here, because I don't know where else to discuss about this. I need help. 

When I was 15, I fell in love with my classmate. All the red flags were there from the beginning, but I'd never felt like that before. I didn't pay attention to the opinions that people had on her at the time. I thought she was wonderful, and I guess, for a little while, she was. On hindsight, it seems like it was all a front she put up for the first few months.

We started dating and all was good in the beginning, but after few months things started crumbling down. On my birthday she told me she'd cheated on me during the first weekend we'd been together. I got upset, but somehow it got turned on its head and I ended up being the one feeling guilty. This didn't end up being the only time, it started happening more and more frequently, with her returning from the weekend with hickeys all around her neck - I was never allowed to leave a mark on her. She'd tell me about it and I wasn't allowed to be upset. She'd remark on people she'd done things with as if it was funny.

Things escalated. I wasn't allowed to speak out of turn, as in, I'd say something and she'd either get angry with me, shush me or ignore me. I wasn't allowed to kiss her without her permission. Once she grabbed me by my throat and held me to the wall after attempting to do so. Sexual situations got more and more controlled, they'd follow her strict rule. I was often in pain but my complains were met with her pushing me down and telling me to shut up. I never told her no, though. I loved her and I wanted to be close with her. She'd start telling people about our private lives and I'd have strangers mock me for things I didn't want anyone to know about.

I was foolish 16 year old when she proposed. Silly, I know, but I was happy. Maybe she'd change, after all. Turns out that wasn't the deal. She told me after few hours that she took it back and of course I was upset, confused. And trapped in the summer cabin for the weekend with no escape from the situation.

Eventually she'd start slapping me when she'd be upset with me. When I argue with someone, I tend to cry easily, and she hated that, and ended up slapping me and grabbing me by my hair and face and yelling me to stop. After some time I started experiencing panic attacks, during which she'd sit on my chest and hold my wrists down, telling me to stop while I hyperventilated and cried.

During last months of our dating, things only got worse. During one house party, she'd kissed my best friend. She'd stolen all my friends at this point. I felt myself shutting down, and she cried and of course made it to be my fault once more. I slapped her and that's only time I ever laid a hand on her. I feel awful about it but I finally reached my boiling point. I still didn't leave. This whole thing ended with me clinging to her legs as she threatened to leave with a knife. 

One of the last things she did was, that we had a huge argument. It ended up with me having a panic attack at 1 in the morning and she ran away from the apartment. It was middle of the winter, freezing cold. She didn't come back until I went looking for her - finding her on the bridge staring into the river and threatening to kill herself because of how I treated her.

She ended up dumping me few weeks later. She did this while I staid overnight at her place. I didn't have anywhere to go, so I laid in bed with her after the most awkward conversation. She begged me back two days later, then dumped me again when I was hurrying to a bus stop to catch the last bus home.

Weirdly enough I felt relief when I got home.

Whole thing wasn't over. During last month or so of us dating, she'd gotten close with another girl. I knew what was up but she didn't admit to it. Of course, after when we broke up, they got together and they'd make sure to be around to make out when we'd have parties in the student housing that my current best friend also staid at. Somehow it turned into her harassing me over social media for being angry with her and we made peace months later when she forced me to apologize. I did because we still had one year of school left and I couldn't live with the hostility anymore.

Years later I finally sent her a long message telling how she'd treated me and how it'd made me feel, to which she responded by blocking me. We haven't been in contact since.

Today, I've been in a relationship for nearly 7 years. Still, I get stressed or angry when certain things happen that remind me of my past relationship. I feel like I can't control it. I feel bitter, angry and fear that she made me this way. I feel like I didn't used to be this defensive and snappy. I've discussed this with therapists and my current partner knows of the situation; but I can't seem to figure out how to forget and move on. I fear that I'll turn into an abusive asshole myself. I don't wanna do to other people what she did to me.

I haven’t showered for a couple days (gross I know), I never do my hair any more, and changing has turned into, what can I be more comfortable in. I hate it. 

Tonight a huge discussion happened after I tried  to hang up the line with him to shower. He proceeded to ask me not to (he likes my scent of nt showerin?) and I said how gross I felt. This turned into us going back and forth, me expressing my feelings and him taking it completely wrong and stating I was intentionally arguing with him.

In my head I knew I had the free ability to shower but my body and mind wouldn’t respond. If I was to have showered I would’ve had to endure hours if not days of how I went against what he asked of me. Though if I didn’t shower he would’ve been happy but I wouldn’t of liked to be touched, And telling him no to anything again leads to hours/ days of torment. 

I’ve left before. I’ve left him for months. Though now I find myself once again sleeping by his side&amp; me praying my kids don’t hear me cry myself to sleep. 

I’m so lost on what to do. Attempt to leave for the millionth time? Stick it out in hopes of a brighter day? Or stick it out 30 more days till my lease ends and leave town?

b1ubo6,"Victims of sibling abuse, how do you get on as adults?","I'm a lurker but this is my first post. I was a victim of sibling abuse for 17 years until I moved out of my parent's home for college and I never went back home. My older sister was physically abusive throughout my childhood and I still suffer from the mental challenges that introduced and continues to have in my life. It was a household where any minor mistake would have resulted in a fist to the body and verbal abuse. I feared voicing my opinion and to make mistakes and I still do. I've long since moved far away and for years, I've had very very minimal contact with my family and I was happier than I ever had been. Free to make mistakes and live life without unnecessary punishment. Finally at peace.

&amp;#x200B;

Over 15 years have passed since then and only recently had to reconnect with this sibling in a major way because our parents are gravely ill. We just went through two years of tough changes for the entire family complete with angry outbursts, me having to comfort my former abuser through times of stress, and tag-teaming with my sibling over care of our parents. I've had to be the stoic one through it all otherwise nothing would have been done in a timely manner. 

&amp;#x200B;

This huge life change took its toll and I found myself in the worst depression I have ever experienced in my life and find myself muttering about dying and just leaving it all for some peace. I'm very introverted naturally but now I have social anxiety again and generally don't like crowds or being outside for long. (I just went to the theatre alone to challenge myself and I was in a mild panic the entire time.) Therapy hasn't helped and all I can do is retreat into my work and cut off connection until the panic and anxiety fades. However, I still have to keep that line open because my parents need our help. 

&amp;#x200B;

At one point, I discussed with her how her treatment of me damaged my adult years and they apologized sincerely and shared with me the struggles she had with abuse from our father. While it was a bit healing to have a one-to-one talk and come to an understanding, at the time I thought I'd be OK. But turns out I'm not. Right now, I've just randomly blocked her number and ability to contact me just so I can ease the anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can I hear from others who have suffered from sibling abuse and how they get on with them? Just need some perspective, advice or someone to relate to.**",izzydodo,2019-03-16 09:34:24,1,465,45.96,36.54,86.95,1,20.22,17.42,93.12,58.28,15.7,12.9,10.11,1.08,0.22,0.86,0.65,2.8,4.52,15.7,10.32,6.24,9.03,1.29,15.91,2.8,1.51,1.08,1.72,1.94,9.68,3.01,6.45,1.72,1.94,1.08,9.25,2.8,0.43,1.08,0.22,11.61,1.29,2.58,1.51,1.94,2.15,2.58,0.65,0,0.43,0,2.15,0.22,1.94,0,0,8.39,4.52,1.29,2.15,0.65,0.22,5.59,10.54,0.22,16.13,2.37,6.67,7.1,1.08,0.86,1.08,0.22,0,0.43,0.22,0,0,0.22,0,0,14.84,4.52,1.94,0,1.72,0.43,0,0.65,0,2.58,0.43,2.58

b26bqq,Feeling stuck in this relationship...,"I don’t really know where else to put this. But when my boyfriend and I get in arguments, sometimes he hits me. We’ve been dating for 3 years— we moved in together after 6 months, but into a shared sublet with another couple. After one year we moved into our own place, and locked ourselves into a lease and since then he has become violent.

It started with benign (ish) things. One time we were arguing, and he smashed a bowl on the floor. Later on, he smashed our standing lamp (one of the ones with the glass bowl/cup around the light bulb). He shoved it over and the bowl smashed on the floor. In both of these cases I got really freaked out— I was abused throughout my childhood (one or two physical incidents, but mostly mental) so when I went into recovery for that I did a lot of research on warning signs for abuse, and when he broke both those things it set the alarm bells off for me, and I told him that.

He talked me down and reassured me, so I stayed.

Then he graduated to light hitting. One time I was cooking something in the kitchen and I was stirring things around 

in a pan with a fork. He came over, we argued. As we were arguing, I was gesturing with my free hand and without paying attention, also shaking the fork. He slapped the back of my hand so hard that my fist came unclenched and I dropped the fork onto the ground. 

I got REALLY upset. I told him it wasn’t ever acceptable to hit me, and again, that every time he has these kind of outbursts it makes me worry that I should leave. He talked me out of it again, “I only hit your hand so you would drop the fork— I was worried for my safety, I thought you might let go of it and hurt me, etc., etc.” So again I moved past it and stayed.

The first time he actually punched me was a few months later (sorry my timeline is really hazy… I remember each of these incidents, but not their associated dates). Again we were having a heated argument. He stormed out of the apartment (I have a vague recollection of him saying that he left so that he wouldn’t hit me, but this may have been said after the incident.) This made me even angrier— my dad used to have a habit of storming out of the house (which boyfriend knows) and so I was really mad that he was pulling that. So as he was leaving down the hallway of our apartment building, I went and hit the back of the door three times to vent my frustration and show him that I was mad he was leaving. 

He came back, opened the door, threw me on the bed and punched me in the temple several times. Then he stormed out again and left me there. It hurt a lot, but mostly it was the emotional pain that was the worst. This was the first time he had hit me in anger just because he was angry— there was no “I was only trying to protect myself” excuse this time, and I knew it. And I felt like I absolutely had to leave him since he had actually hit me. As alluded to above, my parents’ marriage was really toxic, but my mother refused to leave. She said her one line in the sand would be if my father ever hit her— then she would leave. I remember everyone in her family telling her that was too low a bar— considering all the financial abuse, the alcoholism, the abandonment, she had grounds to leave as it was. But she stayed, and I resented her for staying. But he never did hit her, so she never left.

So now I felt compelled to leave— the lowest of low bars, “if he hits you, leave,” had been crossed. At this time

we were still locked into the lease and I got really nauseous thinking about the logistical headache of leaving, but felt I absolutely had to do it, because I couldn’t condone him hitting me this way. But felt I needed to do it.

He came back sometime later— I had stayed in the bed crying the whole time he was gone. I told him I thought we should break up because I couldn’t stay with him since he had hit me. But again he talked me out of it and I stayed. 

I felt really guilty about it, but I stayed.

Since then there have been too many incidents to count. I don’t remember them all. But just a sampling: he has grabbed me by the hair and thrown me by the hair across a hardwood floor, he has covered my mouth and nose so that

I cannot breathe, and then when I struggled and accidentally knocked him with my elbow, clawed me with his nails, he has pinched my inner ear so hard that my ear bled, and he has smacked, cuffed and punched me more times than

I can count, and sometimes even when I am driving. (He loves to tell me how I am such a bad driver). 

I’m familiar with the cycle of violence, and there are similarities in my situation. He does all the above mentioned things for a few months, then it stops for awhile, and sometimes I go a long time without thinking about it or worrying about it and then suddenly it will come back again.

We are in one of the peaceful times again right now— this is because at the end of February, I told him I wanted to break up again (even though we are again, locked into a year-long lease because we moved apartments). We went through a really bad rough patch through November December January and February and by end of February I couldn’t take it any more. 

This was the catalyst. We had a huge fight on Valentine’s Day because we were supposed to go out to a restaurant for dinner, and I wasn’t sure of the way. He told me I could drive down a certain street and then turn into the restaurant, so I listened, but it turned out the street had a median you couldn’t cross so I was forced to stay on 

said street even though it led to a bridge that crossed to another part of the city.

Then as I was trying to get back, and not really sure of where I was, he proceeded to yell and berate me for 45 minutes while I was lost about how I was an idiot and normal people don’t get lost like I do, it’s abnormal and defective and not knowing where I am or how to navigate in unfamiliar areas is a handicap and I’m basically disabled but he puts up with me, even though I am defective and don’t know how to drive or navigate. This went on and on— finally I found the way back and we went to dinner, but I felt really despairing and depressed. This feeling stayed with me for the rest of the week, and the weekend, and then the following Monday I told him I wanted to break up.

Again he talked me out of it. “I love you,” and “we’re a good couple,” and going over all of the plans for the future we have, and asking me to address my concerns, he’ll work on them, blah blah blah. So I stayed again, and there have been fewer altercations lately— still a few, though. He hit me on the arm while I was driving again the other day because I snapped at him and told him that he was basically an addict (he doesn’t drink alcohol but he drinks copious amounts of Coca-Cola. sometimes 12 cans or more in a day) and that I was dumb to think if I avoided men who drank alcohol I could avoid dating my father, but it ended up happening anyway. 

He also covered my mouth the other night in bed because he was making sexual advances on me, which I was pointedly ignoring, to “wake me up.” He knew I had a cold and couldn’t breathe out of my nose. Then when I thrashed, I knocked him with my elbow, and he clawed my face. 

So there have still been incidents, but in the November - February period it was like I would speak and then he would immediately hit, and it was happening several times a week if not every day. This has stopped, for now. He has hit me once or twice since our talk but he has cut way back.

Yet I’m finding I can’t get over these physical incidents, even though they are now happening less frequently. Mostly I feel really ashamed— I feel like I am worse than my mother for staying when she, even she, Ms. “I have no boundaries and I’ll take anything” wouldn’t have stayed. I also worry about the future. He really wants to have kids, and I want that too, but I feel like it will be inevitable if we do that he will either hit our kids or hit me in front of them, which I think would be even worse. When I was in therapy for my childhood issues, I was so sure that I was going to be the one to break the pattern of abuse in my family and that it wouldn’t go down to the next generation but I just feel trapped with no escape now. I feel like I have become my mother and I’m just going to end up perpetuating abuse down to the next generation, even though I hated her so much for doing that to me.

When I tell him these incidents bother me, he dismisses me— he says that I’m not a battered woman, I've never actually seen him angry, and he’s never even used his full strength against me. He is much stronger than me, which I am well aware of. Sometimes he makes me repeat after him and say that I’m not a battered woman. He also loves to tell me that I am an insult to real abuse victims— they are the ones who really suffer, and I’m disrespecting them by claiming I am going through anything even close to what they do. Which is fair, I guess. He’s only bruised me twice in 2 years, and they were small — both the size of a penny, one on my arm, one on my cheekbone. Not really noticeable. And he’s never beat me into the ground or caused a fracture or anything.

I don’t really know what to do. Even though things have been better, I still feel so miserable about past incidents, and now every time he gets mad and doesn’t hit me, I feel like I was overreacting before, or exaggerating how much he was actually hitting me… I just don’t know. I’ve tried breaking up more than once but I’m too weak to go through with it. When I raise any of my concerns he always seems to twist it back around on me, and it makes sense. It’s convincing, and then I just feel like I’m being unreasonable.

If you read all of this, thank you. I don’t even know what I’m hoping to get out of this post. I think I just wanted to tell someone. I’ve kept all of this secret for two years. No one in his family or my family knows— they all really like him, and his family really likes me. I feel like I have nowhere to turn and no one to talk to. So I guess I just wanted to be heard. So thanks for hearing me.",throwaway394058105,2019-03-17 08:33:46,8,1996,16.44,32.07,92.3,3.22,21.23,12.63,93.79,64.33,22.95,17.64,10.47,1.25,0.4,5.01,0.5,5.31,5.11,12.47,8.97,8.62,9.62,2.05,19.14,3.26,2.1,1.4,1.3,2.1,4.81,1.15,3.56,0.65,1.4,0.75,10.97,0.65,0.15,0.95,4.66,12.68,2.51,1.45,1.65,2.35,1.35,4.61,2.51,0.25,0.65,1.45,2.3,0.9,0.6,0.05,0.75,5.71,2.15,0.65,1.65,0.7,0.7,7.77,8.27,1.55,18.64,3.36,7.46,8.67,0.35,0.8,0.95,0.35,0.05,0,0.5,0.15,0,0.1,0.05,0.2,14.08,5.01,5.01,0.05,0,0,0,0.15,0.7,2.2,0.9,0.05

As soo as I told him, he picked the dog up by his collar choking him, hit him in the face ten times, and then threw him across the room. That night he started accusing me of cheating on him again. It was completely out of no where and invalid.
He ended up throwing me around and trying to rape me. He eventually stopped and started crying before he actually put it in. I drove to the police station and charged him with domestic abuse. The other charges they complied after my statement were attempted rape and animal cruelty. I didn’t charge him with either. 
I regret it now. I need to get my dogs out of there. He paid for them, but they are in my name at the vet. I also am their sole caregivers. One of them is even legally in my name by the breeder. I’m going to speak with the police tonight about what steps I need to take to take them from me.
Any advice?

b2dnua,"I think my brother might be abusive, advise?","I went on here for advice because I can’t tell if the stuff he does is normal or not because a lot of awful things were normalized in my house. For the record, I’m 13 years old while I’m typing this and most of these things he did at 19(he is currently 19 as I’m typing this)
The first thing I’m going to talk about is his words, he says words “don’t matter” therefore, according to him, he can say the n-word(he’s Caucasian/white), fa-word, and other offensive things, and it’s your fault if you get hurt by them. Anyway, he says the R-word which I know people use it a lot but I personally don’t like it. I’ve told him to stop but he says them anyway even when I’m at tears. He yelled at me in a car when he thought I muttered,”fuck”, his reaction was much worse. He punched he pretty hard in the shoulder and proceeded to shout out every offensive word including the fa-word at me(I’m bisexual)I was crying for hours because I thought he was going to kill me for liking girls because I could not defend myself as I am a noodle(he didn’t kill me).My brother used the excuse that he was stressed and that I was being annoying. My mom didn’t care(she’s another whole story) and said he was just stressed, this was last week. A few weeks ago I refused to go to school because I felt awful, so to try to get me to get up he put a lighter up to me(I’m fine but I was terrified) I confronted him about it later and he said he was just trying to scare me and I wouldn’t get up. My mom doesn’t care again, I told her I was going to call CPS but she silenced me and then went on how I wasn’t being grateful for all she had done. Today, my brother pushed me into my closet which broke a part of the door, his excuse was that he was just stressed because I wouldn’t be quiet. These were all this month and he was 19 years old. He tells me I’m the crazy one and I should just get over it, he also doesn’t clean up after himself, at 19, then says all the messes is MY fault.

b2q4ua,I'm so close to getting out of this relationship and I'm terrified!,"My ex and I have been together for 12 years. He has been abusive since our first date. After his first outburst we didn't talk for a few months. I don't remember what happened but we went out again and I found myself pregnant a couple of months later. 

I go through this in my head all the time: our first date and what I was thinking to get back with him. I knew there was something off with him but once I was pregnant I thought he would change. He came from a good family and he would get his stuff together. 

I'm sure everyone can guess that he didn't change. He just viewed me as his property (and sex toy). I seriously regret giving up every past opportunity I had to leave him. 

Because I let him take control of my life I have no money and terrible credit. I was in the process of rebuilding my credit and I thought I could get everything together in about six months but over the weekend he wanted to fight with me again. It was a two day fight where he screamed, called me names, and accused me of everything he could think of. Of course he had to get in my face and yell at me to hit him. I didn't. 

I now know I can't wait. I called every apartment in town and made appointments for those that  accept bad credit. It will be a tight fit but I know I can squeeze myself and my daughter in to a one bedroom. 

I keep wanting to not show up to the appointments. I need to remind myself that I need to do this before another one of his outbursts. And I know one is coming.

I'm so excited for the future and the amazing things that await. But I am so terrified of the reality. Of everything that can go wrong. And also having absolutely nothing. I am literally starting over.",grumblegrumble18,2019-03-18 17:02:50,12,345,21.74,34.23,82.75,17.36,12.78,14.2,96.23,63.77,25.8,19.71,13.04,1.16,0,5.51,0,6.09,3.77,14.2,10.14,4.06,7.54,2.32,20.58,3.48,1.16,0.87,2.9,1.74,6.38,2.9,3.48,0.58,1.16,0.29,13.04,1.16,0.58,0.29,5.51,13.91,3.19,1.74,2.61,0.58,2.9,2.9,1.45,0.29,0.58,0.58,1.74,0.58,0.87,0.87,0,8.12,2.61,1.16,1.45,2.61,0.58,6.96,10.72,0.87,15.65,2.32,6.38,7.25,1.16,0.87,0.87,1.16,0,0,0.58,0,0,0.29,0,0,11.88,7.54,0.58,0.29,0,0,0.29,0,0,2.61,0.58,0

Sunday was going great, drinking and hanging out. Later in the night bf and I (together almost 4 years) were messing around, I gently bit him and slapped his butt. All seemed okay, just joking around like we do then his attitude towards me almost an hour later took a complete 180. He started arguing with me in front of everyone and broke up with me which seems to be routine when drinking.  
We eventually leave and the whole way home he is yelling at me about my relationship with his daughter and that it isn't good enough. Tells me to kill myself (I am suicidal) and other terrible things the entire ride home.  
We get into the house and he pushes me onto the bedroom floor, slaps me (not hard enough to leave marks) and tells me I'm going to die tonight. I'm crying and begging him to let me go to bed since I was supposed to work the next morning, he's on my chest and stomach. I start to puke and he tells me to choke on it. Tells me that everyone saw me bite him and how terrible I am but he isn't going to leave any marks on me. After what felt like an hour he finally got up after I told him I'd go to bed with him.

I was able to get a no-contact order against him while he was in jail. He was in for multiple things such has vehicular assault, felony harassment, breaking no contact orders etc. It will obviously not stop him. He has no common sense and doesn’t know when to stop.

b35z3z,Roommate in DV relationship wants permission to have abuser in our house.,"My roommate and good friend has an abusive boyfriend. They were in a toxic relationship for a while and I was worried about physical violence for several months but she always denied it. A few weeks ago he attacked her while drunk and attempted to strangle her at our house. She managed to get away and woke me up. Once he saw I was awake he calmed down and we got him out of the house.

For the few days after she was a mess, but made me promise her multiple times never to let him back in the house and never let them get back together. Over the last few weeks they have been talking more. She has simultaneously been going through other hard family/work issues and was struggling. One day when low she asked me to let him come over.... I said no and she told him not to come.

A week ago she again asked for him to come over multiple times. I still said no and she left to stay at his dad's place for 2 days. She stayed there again this last weekend.

They've been hanging out almost every day again and she has started bringing him by the house when I'm not there. I'm not really okay with him being there, but I'm conflicted because I don't want her to move out. 

I absolutely love our house (great area, good price, close to work and friends) so some of it is selfish but I'm worried if I don't let him come back she will move in with him. 

She hasn't told her family or friends the truth and I've been emotionally helping her through the last couple weeks. No one else in her life knows what's going on so I feel very responsible. She's one of my best friends. 

I'm worried if they live together things will escalate to a more dangerous degree. He has drinking issues and they fight a lot but usually only when they are alone. I will hear them fight but almost never physically see them fight. He currently lives with his dad and I'm at our house so at least usually there will be someone else in the house to potentially diffuse the situation.

What should I do? Do I let him come back or do I risk her moving out and the abuse escalating?",bumbletumble12,2019-03-19 18:40:36,4,409,18.51,78.31,50.18,4.01,15.73,12.96,96.33,61.12,20.54,18.58,5.87,1.22,0,9.29,2.2,1.96,4.4,12.22,11,7.33,8.31,2.93,20.29,3.91,1.22,1.22,1.22,3.18,6.6,2.2,4.4,1.22,1.71,0.49,19.8,0.98,1.71,5.13,4.89,10.02,0.49,0.49,1.22,2.93,1.96,4.4,1.71,0.49,0.73,0.49,2.2,0,1.47,0,0.49,10.27,4.65,0.98,2.93,1.71,0.49,6.6,11,1.96,20.78,3.18,9.05,10.02,0.98,1.47,2.93,0.24,0,0,0.49,0,0,0.49,0,0,12.22,6.6,0.98,0,0,0.49,0,0,0,3.42,0.49,0.24

In the morning he'll make coffee and kiss my head as he rushes out the door.
Sometimes he'll leave without saying a word. Depending on the stranger, depending on the night mood.
Today this new man stayed longer, he had more time to spend with me.
He helped me with my paperwork.
He helped me with my finances.
He helped me make a grocery list of all the things I was allowed to buy, but not a penny more.
He helped me to realize all the mistakes I'd been making because I was too foolish to see them myself.
I didn't care for this new man, but at least he didn't slap me like the one who stayed a few nights ago.
Or the man who poured a bucket of ice water on my head while I slept because I was too tired to give myself to him.
No.
This man was not as violent as the others but there was still a cold and unforgiving look in his eyes as I walk out the door to buy groceries.
He stops me as I turn to leave.
""Don't get lost, the tracker will tell me if you've stopped anywhere else. I love you.""

b38051,Can I get help?,"So I moved out and rented a place with my current boyfriend whom I dated for a long time about 8 years I would say. I moved out because I had family issues anyway, my dad always yelled at me almost everyday even when I did nothing wrong and at times he would say to me ""Get out if you don't like to live here!"" or sometimes just ""Get the fuck out!"" So I've had it with him, I never really had the kind of love and support from home. I thought with my boyfriend, I can find the missing parts and since we been together for so long, I could trust him. It's the 3rd year now since we been living tgt, he chose this place and it is very expensive he said it will be fine. He then started quitting jobs and joining another and it has been going like this since the beginning, I am working full time but all my income goes to all payments with only little left for food and home things. I don't even have money for my wellbeings, I tried to sit him down and talk for many many many times and it never works, he wouldn't answer and woule judt ignore me and at times I become mad because od the situation and he would scream back that he doesn't want to work and so how I am supposed to support everything. I have asked for a lot of money from friends, relatives and got loan because I don't know what to do, I just renewed the apartment contract and still have 9 more months to go, I renewed it because he said he would look for job and start working and the landlord was asking to renew. I recently had 2 injuries, one that got myself not able to walk and I am on leave from work but he isn't helping me. I tried to discuss with him that either he moves out or I move out, he would always become so violent if I bring up the break up thing, he would throw my stuffs out make a mess at home and hurt me. I am so done with this relationship, I am tired of taking care of everything all by myself and I am not able to due to my injuries this time and I am running out of time till payments due.

b38c56,I feel crazy. Venting and still feel guilty.,"SO and I weren't on good terms for a few months. We both were unfaithful in small or large aspects, we both thought divorce would be best. I got caught, they hid it way better. I was texting an old flame, They Found out and adamantly said they never sent nudes or flirted with anyone. found out months later my assumptions were correct.

They Began to belittle my effort and said I tricked them into thinking I was perfect for them. Told me my effort was not even bare minimum, a normal husband does more.

They went on to throw things in my direction every now and then. (Told me throwing things in my direction isn't abuse, they didn't intend to hit me.) We would argue then they would text their ex spouse. Told them t's too dangerous at the house and they have to come get the kids.
 Would tell all their friends I was abusive, I smoked weed (they would smoke with me occasionally) would leave the house with nothing to eat (pantry was stocked, but I do admit that going out to eat and not shopping first is inconsiderate), when I did something they didn't like they would post nudes to get revenge/attention (put a header stating I was xyz of a husband and vent to same people). We changed our phone numbers because people we agreed we didn't want to contact us kept doing it. I told them to let people know what happened and how to reach her. These same people later called the cops on me because they were fearful of her being harmed.  

Told their ex that I made them get rid of their car because I wanted to control them. In reality, I aksed them to sell it so it would make the move easier, I also used my savings to pay the rest off, because money was owed, let them keep the money they got for it. 
 
Told friends and ex that I made them quit their job, we went for my friends funeral. Truth was, they wanted to keep me company on the drive home. I offered to buy a ticket and they said it's okay we don't need to. I just feel like I'm crazy for thinking they are abusive. There is more but I don't know what to say.

b395w5,"[m, OH] Feel like I’m being held hostage in my marriage","Before I get into my situation, I need to provide some context. Male, I’m currently on probation for a non-violent violation of a protection order with another woman. I essentially trespassed near her apartment while she wasn’t home, otherwise I’ve never had any history of violence or any other criminal record. I’ve never hit a woman or another person before in my life. Her protection order was dismissed later on (she had brought it to impede a child custody case I brought against her over our son). However, because of the violation, a No Contact order was placed on me by the state. She has since tried to have it removed, but the Judge refused her request because of harassing texts my wife has sent her. I was warned by the Judge if my wife tries to communicate with the other woman, I will go to jail.

I feel trapped in my relationship with my wife because of my current probation situation. She routinely threatens to call or text the other woman if I miss answering her phone even a single time, knowing that this would put me in jail. She threatens to take my children away and that I won’t ever see them again and they’ll grow up not knowing their father. She made me get a tracking app on my phone and tracks my location throughout the day. If I try to turn it off, she threatens to get me in trouble through my probation. She routinely tries to put me down and tries to make me feel that I’m inadequate as a father and I would be nothing without her (I’m actually the sole provider for the family, I’m the only one paying any of the bills).

I just don’t know what I can do. I feel like I’ve got this giant scarlet letter DV hanging over me and nobody cares about my situation because of it. I will always be seen as the aggressor in any situation, no matter if I’m trying to leave or get away. Because of my own DV charge, I’ve gone through some classes to recognize the signs of domestic violence on the Power and Control wheel. I can identify my wife on multiple areas of the wheel (Coercion/Threats, Intimidation, Emotional abuse, Isolation, Minimizing/Denying/Blaming, Using Children) and feel like I’m a victim myself, but it doesn’t feel like there’s anyone I can turn to for help.",BusyIdea,2019-03-20 00:45:45,4,419,52.58,22.97,85.87,1,20.95,20.29,91.17,58,21,16.71,12.17,0.24,0,3.58,0.72,4.3,5.73,16.23,8.59,2.86,6.68,2.86,18.14,2.15,2.15,0.24,0.48,2.39,5.25,0.24,5.01,1.19,2.86,0.72,12.17,2.15,0.24,5.49,0.95,14.32,2.86,2.39,1.91,4.06,1.19,4.77,2.39,0.48,0.48,1.43,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,12.65,2.39,1.67,6.44,1.43,1.91,3.82,12.41,0.95,13.13,2.86,5.97,3.58,0.48,0.48,0.95,0.48,0,0,0.48,0,0.24,0,0.24,0,15.99,4.53,4.53,0,0,0,0,0.24,0,4.06,1.43,1.19

b3hsdr,My [24 F] best friend [25 F] is in denial about being in an abusive relationship and it's starting to affect my overall day/moods,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, but here it goes--

7 months ago, I got out of an emotionally abusive relationship and I'm starting to feel better and get my life back again. One of my best friend's has been there for me during my darkest days, and I'm there for her during hers. The problem is, she's in a physically and emotionally abusive marriage and she's in complete denial about it-- to the point where she gets defensive if anyone tells her that his actions are unhealthy. She calls me all the time crying, panicking, and complaining about her life and their relationship, but doesn't care to listen what anyone really has to say. Her constant negativity and toxicity is starting to really put a downer on my moods, days, and overall recovery from the abusive relationship I just got out of-- especially when lately, I've been doing great!

Last night she called me and told me something extremely disturbing and I have no idea what to do. Her and her husband \[25 M\] got into a fight. He shoved her up against the by her neck and threatened to kill her and himself after. His mom witnessed this (they both live with his parents) and defended him saying, ""he wouldn't be doing this if you were being a good wife to him-- he's trying to teach you how to be a woman"".

I told her she MUST get the fuck out of there and call the police. She then got defensive and said, ""he's not a bad person, he just has problems with his anger"". She went back to him, he apologized by buying her a diamond necklace, and texts me this morning telling me to ""forget all about last night's call because they worked it out and they're better than ever"".

But here's the thing, I woke up crying and filled with so much hate and negativity-- I'm an empath, so I really take a toll on certain topics, especially if it involves my friends. I do my best to be a great friend everyday, especially when she's been there for me during my dark times, but I've come to my breaking point. I can't keep being her outlet to this shit when she doesn't want to do anything about it or listen to anyone's advice when it comes to her relationship (she doesn't even tell her therapist any of this).

I'm not sure where to start or how to approach this, I can't take all of this toxicity in my life anymore. I must and need to set a boundary, but I have no idea how. I love her, but it's really hard to be a supportive friend when she's in complete denial about her situation. My self love and health must come first at this point since I feel nothing but negativity and hate in my heart.

Has anyone been in a similar situation like this before? How can I set boundaries with her without feeling like/being a terrible friend doing it?

Thank you guys so much &lt;3

TL;DR: My friend is in denial about being in an abusive relationship and it's taking a toll on my mood, health, and day. How do I set boundaries with her while also being a good friend?",knees4bees,2019-03-20 14:33:23,0,582,18.16,60.18,21.78,4.66,24.25,13.75,94.67,63.57,21.82,16.32,7.56,0,0.52,7.73,0.52,5.5,4.81,13.75,10.14,7.73,9.79,2.75,19.07,2.92,2.06,2.41,1.2,1.2,8.42,2.92,4.98,0.52,2.23,0.34,17.01,0.86,1.37,5.84,2.75,12.2,0.86,1.37,2.06,2.75,3.09,4.3,1.89,0.34,0.86,0.69,3.26,0.69,2.06,0.17,0,9.45,3.44,1.55,1.72,3.44,0.86,3.09,12.2,0.17,13.4,1.55,5.5,6.53,0.52,0,0,0.17,0,0.17,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,0,18.73,3.26,4.3,0.17,0.34,0.52,0.17,1.72,1.03,4.64,0.69,1.89
b3hxkw,Slow-burn domestic violence?,"I’m not exactly sure if this is the place to post this, since this seems rather tame, but it’s been eating me up inside and I need to figure out if this is the beginnings of a situation that’s escalating, or an isolated incident. 

Please forgive me if this seems a bit scatterbrained, but this is really difficult to put out there. 

Late last week my wife (32 f) decided to quit smoking.  She was a ball of ornery and bitchy. Friday last week it changed into rage. Despite my (33 mtf, not presenting) encouragement, support, and letting her know how she was acting, she continued to be a ball of rage and never listened to me when I made a few suggestions to help her calm down. That night as I was going to bed, she went off and a small argument ensued where at one point I was slapped on the arm, with me telling her that she’d gone into “crazy bitch” that day. After I said that, wife says with a venom I’ve never heard in her voice before “I’ll show you crazy bitch!” and tried to shove me off the bed. Her first attempt failed, but she succeeded on the second. I immediately got up, grabbed my pillows and tried to head out of the room only to be blocked by wife between our bed and wall, her crying saying she was sorry. At this point fight for flight was kicking in and I asked her to move repeatedly. She didn’t. I then tried to go around her and she grabbed my pillows to keep me in the room/pull me onto the bed. Luckily the one she grabbed slipped from my grasp and I was able to get out, saying something that I don’t remember as I left. I do have roommates/very good friends who I informed of the incident that night. 

The being hit wasn’t the first time that’s happened, as I’ve been hit on the arm a couple times previously and have caught a couple elbows to the side, but there was some time between those incidents and they happened after I came out. Before I came out as trans, she had thrown objects in my direction when she’s been extremely mad and slammed stuff down. She was also mentally and emotionally abusive as well, and still is to a degree (I’ve learned to spot it and try and resist) along with being a habitual liar. 

Since then, I’ve slept in the living room a couple nights, but had to switch back to the bed cuz of waking up sore. My sleep schedule is all kinds of messed up and when I do go to bed, my mind races until I pass out from being exhausted and have even had a couple nightmares. Wife has said that she’s sorry for what happened, wants to take it back, things go back to how they were and that she loves me. I can’t take her at face value for reasons stated above. I’m finding it hard to be in her presence, don’t initiate and physical contact and don’t talk to her much. I’ve also noticed that when I sleep in the living room I tend to sleep deeper and wake up a bit more refreshed than in the bedroom. 

Is this the start of an escalating situation of domestic violence that’s been building over the last 10 years of marriage (especially over the last 3) that I should be worried about, or was this an isolated incident?",azlynn24,2019-03-20 14:45:07,5,597,54.33,38.13,87.17,4.91,22.11,13.74,93.47,59.63,18.09,12.56,7.54,0.17,0.17,4.36,0.34,5.53,6.37,16.92,9.72,4.69,8.54,1.68,20.44,4.36,2.01,1.51,1.51,1.84,6.03,2.01,4.02,0.17,1.68,1.01,9.72,0.84,0.5,5.03,0,9.21,2.18,1.51,1.17,1.84,1.17,3.35,2.51,0.17,1.34,1.01,3.02,1.68,0.84,0,0.34,6.7,1.84,1.84,2.35,1.01,0.34,8.04,9.21,0.84,20.27,3.02,9.38,8.38,0.67,0.34,2.68,0,0,0,0.84,0.5,0.17,0,0.17,0,14.91,4.02,4.36,0,0,0.34,0.17,0.17,0.67,3.52,1.34,0.34
b3ipj8,"Girl (21F) that I (22M) went out with on a date is back with her abusive ex (19?M) a day later, and I think she's in danger[new]","I met this girl on Bumble and we really hit it off pretty quickly. After 5 days of talking, I picked her up at her house and we went out to eat. The date didn't go well, as I was really nervous, but I didn't think it went that badly that she wouldn't want to see me again. On the ride home, she told me that she literally just got her period (I'm assuming she said this so that I wouldn't go inside her house since her parents weren't home).

Shortly later in the car ride she told me about her ex, who she said was very manipulative and violent. He had broken her car windshield, told her that if she left him he would kill himself, and said that she broke up with him after he hit her when she was trying to leave the house. She said she kept trying to break up with him, but he stalked her to the gym and other places. She also said she's worried that one day he's going to be outside her house and is going to kill her. This all happened a month ago. This is all that I remember, but I can imagine the details get even worse than what she shared in the 7 minute car ride home.

So I arrive at her house, and there is a running car parked facing her house, but on the wrong side of the road. It was close to her house, but not directly in front of it. I didn't really think too much about it, but I went in a small loop to drop her outside her house, and then I drove past the car as I was going home. After seeing a picture of her ex, I believe he was the one in the car.

I arrived home, and texted her saying I was back (at around 10:30 pm). She didn't open my message until the next day at around 12 saying that she didn't think that it would work out. I was bummed, but then things started to get weird. Later that day, she had another guy's name in her Instagram bio. The day after that, I find that she had blocked and then unblocked me on Instagram so that I couldn't see her private account, and also removed me from Snapchat. She posted a new picture that day, but I couldn't see it. She had also went from 55 followers to 26 in that day, which was pretty suspicious, because that meant she blocked and unblocked all of them. Then she changed her username from her name to something nonsensical.

My sister made a fake Instagram account and followed her, and she successfully was able to see the photos. She uploaded something that had 4 photos , with her and her boyfriend and a caption of ""boyfriend and best friend."" The boyfriend had a different hair length in each picture, so they weren't taken over the course of a couple days. I'm pretty much 100% this boyfriend is the ex she talked about, so I am very worried about her safety. I also noticed that a lot of her guy followers were gone, so it seemed to me like her ex is really controlling/jealous and wanted them not to follow her.

What do I do in this situation? I don't want her to be hurt, but I'm afraid if I try to do something this guy will find out and her hurt more.

​

TL;DR - Went out with a girl, day after date she tells me its not going to work out and that same day has a guy's name in her Instagram bio.

b3nc9z,Thoughts about previous sex with abusive partner in light of long term infidelity - looking for opinions,"My (22F) ex-boyfriend (22M) was emotionally and physically abusive for the majority of our two year relationship.  In the middle of the relationship, I found out that he was having an affair with a high schooler for 85% of our relationship.  He wasn’t having sex with the other girl (allegedly) but was texting her everyday for about a year and a half and meeting up with her to make out sans clothing fairly regularly for a few months.  This, compounded with all of his other abuse, makes me feel like every time we had sex, he was sexually assaulting me.  I think that, even though I was a willing and excited participant for most of our sexual encounters, I feel like he didn’t give me the opportunity to have informed consent when he purposefully didn’t clue me in on the affair.  

I have a lot of mixed feelings about this and desperately don’t want to be a girl who wrongfully calls rape, of which I don’t really think this qualifies.  Furthermore, I’m not looking to get him in trouble or speak openly about this in my real life.  I’m just looking for some guidance and other people’s opinions on how I can frame this for myself as I move on.  Thankfully, because of some of his other less desirable actions I have a protective order and he is safely residing in jail.

TLDR: After learning of long term infidelity, I feel like my partner didn’t look for my full consent during sexual encounters leading me to feel violated.

b3nw3q,My experience,"I wanted to share my story. I'm typing this on my phone so I apologise for any mistakes and for it being so long. My memory is also a little hazy with some things he had done.

My family and I were in a DV situation (physical, verbal, emotional, financial) for 15 years. Mum met him after we had moved interstate (I was 7-8 at the time) and everything seemed okay. Mum had two more kids with him, my brother and sister.

The first thing I can remember clearly was being thrown across the kitchen floor, my mum standing by the sink, heavily pregnant and having an asthma attack. Five minutes later, I remember being thrown out onto the front yard. This happened when I was 9 and I was getting ready for school. I have no idea why he was so angry.

After my brother was born, he wouldn't let me touch him, play with him, talk, spend time etc. All I wanted was to spend time with the brother I always wanted but he wouldn't let me. He had another child from a previous marriage and he would let her do all the things I wanted. He would also ignore Mum and I whenever my stepsister was around.

I had moved in with my grandparents a short time after that and heard from Mum that she and him had argued a lot and she was going to leave him, but him being a narcissist, hooked her and got her to stay.

They had moved up here to be closer to us (my grandparents and I lived two hours away) and I would stay over on the weekends. Almost everytime I was there, my mum would be crying and having an asthma attack at the same time due to having yet another argument with him. She was also pregnant with my sister at this time. I wasn't allowed to spend time with my sister either after she was born. 

Start of highschool, I moved back in with them and this is where I really remember what he did to us. It wasn't unusual for me to rock up to school, crying my eyes out because of him. 

He would throw plates, cups, bowls, cans, anything he could get his hands on at me, he would have my siblings cowering in a corner on a regular basis just for being kids and wanting to have fun or if they had accidentally broken a cup. He'd force us to eat foods that we despised (I can't stand the sight of seafood now). He constantly cheated on my mother. He harassed girls that are younger than me on the train home from work. Us three kids watched him beat our mother up multiple times. One time, I worked up the courage to punch him to stop it. He hit me in return but I didn't care because it got him off my Mum. He'd constantly ask what something cost, even if it was the cheapest little thing or something we needed. He'd constantly break our valuables and then laugh when we found out. He used to spit on me, on my food, if we didn't clean up our mess or empty the vacuum after we used it, he spread the contents on our beds, clothes, other belongings.

He would rummage through my bedroom, what I thought was my only safe space in the house, and steal my stuff or break it. If he wanted to illicit a reaction from Mum, he would target me, saying that I did this, that and the rest of it. 

We didn't realise that it was in fact DV until a social worker said something. Mum described what he was doing and the social worker said ""that's domestic violence"". It bummed us out because we knew it was happening but never put a name to it.

It's been 7 months since he's moved out and we're all healing from the ordeal. His and Mum's divorce went through last week and is officially finalised in April. The energy at home has changed, we now have friends over for a visit or sleeping over regularly. We have our music up loud, make stupid noises, do stupid things without fear of being abused for it.

I know some people feel stuck and that there is no way out. Some people don't survive, and some do and that some don't like to talk about it.
I share my experience with people in hopes that it may help someone going through a similar situation.",dattAshth0,2019-03-21 01:07:22,0,765,27.6,74.34,39.97,14.86,17.39,12.68,94.9,61.96,23.4,16.73,7.71,2.75,0,5.88,0.39,6.67,4.71,13.59,11.24,4.05,7.06,1.83,20.39,3.66,1.83,1.18,1.44,1.96,4.84,1.96,2.75,0.13,1.44,0.39,16.47,3.4,0.13,3.01,5.62,12.16,1.44,1.7,3.27,3.4,1.18,3.14,2.35,0.52,1.18,0.39,2.09,0.65,0.92,0.26,0.52,9.28,4.97,1.18,2.75,0.65,0.26,9.41,6.41,0.52,16.34,2.22,7.71,6.54,1.18,0.92,1.31,0.78,0,0,0.13,0,0,0.13,0,0,14.51,5.62,4.84,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.26,2.61,1.05,0
b3t2y3,Concerned about wife,"Thank you for taking the time to read this.


I am somewhat in a desperate situation. I am a British man living in China and married to a Chinese woman. I have recently become deeply concerned about her mental health and of the nature of our relationship.


Some background: I am 31 and she is 30. We met in July 2017, several months after she was widowed by her former husband committing suicide. After dating for several months we decided to move to a new city together in January 2018, working there (we both work in education) and living together.


Looking back, there have been many 'red flags' in the relationship, probably ever since the beginning. She often came off as 'clingy' and 'needy', with her mood often dropping. She would sometimes have extreme emotional reactions to things - some of which, to my eyes, seemed like an extreme over-reaction. The relationship has always been unstable, with us breaking up and getting back together countless times.


Since we moved to this new city, things have definitely gotten worse. I love her and do things to make her happy, at least from my perspective. However, she has not been happy since we moved here. She does have good days, but her emotions seem very unstable. We seem stuck in a patter of everything being 'OK', to her getting immensely angry at me over something, to slipping into a deep depression, back to being 'normal' - sometimes all in one day.


Twice she has gone back to her home city after a big argument. Once was in March last year, which I believe was around the time of the anniversary of her husband's suicide. The other was last summer. The first time she said she didn't feel that I loved her, that I never did anything for us in the relationship (and she has done a lot, to be fair). I decided then that I wanted to propose to her, to show her that I loved her. I wanted the moment to be special, though, and kept putting off when to do it. She expressed similar sentiments in the summer, but she did come back and I proposed. We got married in September.


Now I'm thinking if these actions of hers are part of a borderline personality, where the person pushes someone away so they can see if they will fight to get them back, validating the feelings of needing to know they won't be abandoned. I don't know.


She lost her temper at me several times in the last city, but it is here that she first hit me. It has happened several times since then. Each time she will blame me for making her lose her temper. She has also thrown things in our apartment and pushed me on numerous occasions.


As things have gotten worse, I feel like I have changed my behaviour so as to preempt her mood changes, trying to keep her happy and gauge her reactions to everything. Essentially, I feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells, so to speak, and holding my breath, waiting for the next time she gets angry at me.


Over time, I have cut myself off from what minimal social circles I was a part of here - namely people I got on well with from work. This is not usual for me - this is the first time in my adult life that I haven't had a social life or a circle of friends. It feels like she has slowly guilt tripped me into spending all of my free time with her - I do not even bother bringing up possibly meeting up with friends now, as I know what her reaction will be: giving me the cold shoulder, making me feel guilty for leaving her along in the apartment.


Something else that now strikes me is the fact that she wanted to have my bank card. It is not unusual for Chinese women to be in control of the finances, being that they do not trust their husbands to not have affairs. Of course, I am not Chinese and she knows that, as a westerner, I am not comfortable with someone else having control of what is essentially my life's savings. Over time, though, she wore me down, telling me that I needed to do it to show her that I love her. This is something that she says with frequency to me, that I have never shown my love for her, making me always thinking what I can do for her and always blaming myself for when things go wrong in the relationship. I've even blamed my MBTI type for being 'bad at relationships' (I'm INTP, she's ISTJ - not that I put too much stock in this).


I'm not exactly sure what has 'clicked' for me recently, but I think it comes down to becoming immensely uncomfortable with the possibility of violence that hangs in the air sometimes. She hit me a couple of months ago, and I said to myself then that if she did it again I would leave the apartment for some time, either stay with a colleague or check into a hotel. About two weeks ago she hit me again - I didn't do anything, though I expressed how much of a red line it was for me. She taunted me to hit her back, which I did not do, of course, and asked me to divorce her. She calmed down and we went to sleep. In the morning she 'play' hit me several times about me shouting at her the night before (I had shouted something like ""Don't hit me!"").


I went to work feeling upset, intimidated and uncomfortable. I don't know why, but I started to Google about female to male domestic violence, emotional blackmail, manipulative partners, and so forth. I found myself uncomfortably saying 'Yes' to a lot of the questions asked on the sites I read.


One of them mentioned something about borderline personality disorder (BPD), which I then started to read a lot about. The more I read, the more it seemed like this is what my wife has. She is very emotionally unstable and a lot of her behaviour seems like it's a manifestation of abandonment anxiety, possibly related to the suicide of her former husband.


I spent a few days reading what I could about BPD, abusive relationships, emotional abuse and felt like I was drowning. The thought of going home to someone who is (potentially?) mentally unstable and (probably?) abusive to me made me incredibly anxious.


The anxiety got worse and I reached out to a friend back home and to my manager at work (I read that it was a good idea to tell someone you work with). They were supportive and assured me that they believed me and that I do not deserve to suffer any kind of abuse, whether physical or emotional.


My original thinking was to sit her down and talk to her about everything. My manager, who has her own experience of abusive relationships, advised me to get some important things out of the apartment first (passport, visa docs, etc.). This was Monday just gone. I thought maybe I could get some things out of the apartment when she goes to teach on a Thursday and I have some time by myself before I go to work. With the anxiety and, I have to say, fear about everything that was swimming in my head (Is she mentally ill? Does she have BPD? Is this an abusive marriage?), I was unable to wait until then. Late Monday night, I packed a bag with my passport, visa documents, my reclaimed bank card and a change of clothes and ran to a friend's apartment. I felt cowardly and ashamed doing this - and still do - but I was utterly desperate and truly felt like I could not be around her, at least for the time being.


I stayed at my manager's place that night and booked a hotel room until Saturday (as I write, it is Thursday night). She called me while I was at my manager's, unsure how to respond when I told her, distressed, on the phone that I thought she was unwell and was abusing me. I insisted that I just needed some distance for a few days, to feel safe and clear my head.


Tuesday morning she called several times and I eventually answered. She said she wanted to speak, which I agreed to do. I left my passport and things at my manager's and took only my person to the apartment to talk to her. As calmly as I could I told her what I have been thinking - that I thought she has a mental illness, possibly BPD, and that she is sometimes abusive. At first she was numb, slightly dismissive. Then, she was incredibly upset and distressed. She begged and pleaded me not to leave and 'abandon' her (her word). I told her that I needed to look after myself before I look after anybody else, and that I love her and only blame the illness, whatever it is. I was there 30-40 minutes or so, where she kept pleading. I was upset as well and nearly agreed to stay; however, all the things I'd read about manipulation where at the forefront of my mind and I stayed firm, sticking to my plan of staying in a hotel for a few days to have some distance form her (or from the illness?) so I can clear my head. She tried to cling on to me, blocked the door, and mentioned committing suicide. Her words were: ""I won't, but what if I did?"" She said that if I didn't stay she would fly back to her home city. She also said she would move into an apartment on her university campus, as she could not be alone and could not sleep without me. I do not know where she is right now.


My emotions, feelings and thoughts about this have been all over the place the last few days. It has been good to have some distance, some space to sort my thoughts, as messy as they are. I have reached out to some trusted and close friends who have been supportive of me and expressed sympathy for my wife, though in varying degrees (one friend just told me to leave her and get divorced).


My manager knows someone who is a psychologist and spoke to him, possibly forwarding him the original email that I sent to her. She sent me what he said to her, which has kept me thinking.


First of all, I am not trained in medicine or psychology, which is correct. Further, even if I was, I am too close to give any kind of diagnosis - again, absolutely legitimate thing to point out.


What he did say, though, was that it didn't sound like BPD to him, that she could in fact be bipolar. Whatever it is though, he thought she needed to see a professional and be on some kind of medication.


So, now I've been reading more about bipolar disorder and BPD, trying to see which one 'fits' more. I don't think she has periods of mania, though that could be because I overlook things or am unable to see it. It could also be because my idea of bipolar disorder is formed by popular media representations of the illness, such as in movies where the intense high of the mania is followed by a deep depression. Like I said, it seems like her mood changes are more rapid than that.


I think she meets 5 of the 9 symptoms of BPD: fear of abandonment, unstable relationships, extreme emotional swings, feelings of emptiness, explosive anger. Though she does also seem to have some bipolar symptoms as well: mood swings, anger, hopelessness, irritability, high sex drive, sometimes cries a lot. So I am unsure which illness it is, if it is either of them. Either way, I know I am not trained and that she needs to seek professional help so that she can be diagnosed.


My current thinking is to check out of the hotel and go home after work on Saturday. Maybe she will be there, maybe not. I want to try and convince her to see a doctor and stress that I am here to support her. Though she will probably still be hurt that I left her.


A concern, however, is the lack of mental health awareness and treatment in China. There is stigma around it, related to 'face culture'. Further, being a developing country, there is a sever lack of resources for MH treatment. That said, we are in a relatively developed and prosperous Tier 2 city and there is a hospital here that treats psychological problems.


That's where I am. Apologies if this was rambling or if I have left out any crucial information. But I am at a loss about what do, made all the more difficult by being in a foreign country and away from my support network of friends and family. Any advice you could give would be greatly appreciated.

b3toeo,A Crazy Girlfriend With A Knife!!,"\*\*\*This is quite a long story but is worth it as there is a huge pay off at the end for anyone who has been abused by their partner this is for them\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I met her back in 2010 whilst at a party, I have decided to call her CrazyKnifeBitch (CKB for short) for reasons that will become clear by the end of this hellish story. anyway I had been single for almost a year by this point &amp; she seemed genuinely nice with an exciting, yet eccentric personality, we hit it off pretty quick &amp; swapped numbers that night. The next day I woke up hung over &amp; found 3 messages &amp; a missed call from her on my phone (this should have tipped me off there was something wrong) but I shrugged it off calling her back &amp; we got chatting about the night before &amp; she then asked me out on a date, during the date she admitted to having a 5 year old kid we'll call her Abby, I didn't mind as I was actually having a great time with her &amp; things escalated fast we became intimate within that same date &amp; for the first 3 months things were great I got on with her kid too. On a nightout we met each others friends but one of her male friends didn't seem too friendly, not mean or anything more fearful for some reason I found out why later that night, when CKB went to use the toilet &amp; her nervous friend approached me looking over his shoulder before leaning in he says ""I am telling you this from experience, you see I dated CKB for 2 months &amp; she may seem sweet but she will show another side soon enough"" I thought he was just a jealous ex who was trying to cause drama. (I wish I had listened to him).

&amp;#x200B;

I told CKB about what the conversation &amp; she laughed it off, days later I was walking down the street &amp; saw him walking his dog I waved over to him &amp; he ignored me so I went over to him as he turned I saw it, he had a huge black eye, almost swollen shut I asked what happened &amp; he said ""I am not telling you a damned thing, but gave a smirk &amp; reiterated his statement from that night"".

&amp;#x200B;

I brought up the fact I saw her ex looking a little worse for wear &amp; she played dumb &amp; said  ""oh he's always getting himself beaten up"" I never said he'd been beaten up just what I said above so my suspicions grew

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the violence began, I was going out for my birthday but CKB was sick &amp; I wasn't going to go  but she insisted she would be fine telling me to have fun. Not even half an hour into my night out did she call me &amp; ask who was out &amp; if there were any girls there? I said yes 2 of them who were friends for years anyway. she paused &amp; said okay have fun, minutes later my phone went off a message saying ""send pictures"" I called her &amp; said ""Why do you want pictures"" she said aggressively ""forget about it"" another hour passed &amp; suddenly she turned up shouting at me about being selfish &amp; a liar as there was now 3 more girls had turned up. I was embarrassed by this turn of events I said ""listen CKB you told me to come out and have fun &amp; these other ""girls"" are friends of my friends so chill"" Her face red as she shook with rage &amp; this happened so fast she picked up a glass from a nearby table flinging it at me I tried to move out of the way &amp; it shattered against the  wall behind me glass went every where. I felt a warm sensation trickling down my neck, pulling my hand away &amp; its covered in blood. CKB storms out as I stand up &amp; slip in the now pooling blood I look back at my friends who stare in horror as my white shirt is now red as they jump into action grabbing my hand pressing it down hard on my neck &amp; rushing me to hospital, 3 hours &amp; 18 stitches later I am interviewed by the police I didn't mention her I said it was a fight that got out of hand.

&amp;#x200B;

days later I am recovering still &amp; she has called &amp; messaged dozens of times I finally relent &amp; answer &amp; she is crying down the phone how sorry she is &amp; asks to talk, me being an idiot gave in &amp; we talked for a long time where she admitted that she had Bipolar &amp; had been through a lot that I can't get into here, in the months that followed things were great other than a few arguements we were getting closer her daughter Abby even started calling me dad &amp; I cared a great deal for her she even got me addicted to the show Spongebob Squarepants, with her birthday coming up me &amp; CKB went shopping &amp; I found the perfect gift for her in a yellow Spongebob dress, the week of her birthday she was at the dinner table playing with her water colours while me &amp; CKB were washing dishes &amp; having a heated arguement about her working on Abby's birthday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly Abby cried out ""oh nooo"" &amp; me &amp; CKB turned to see her water container had spilled on the table wetting some letters of CKB's what happened next still makes my blood boil to this day, CKB ran up &amp; punched her daughter in the face so hard her head flew back against the back of the chair. I stood there taking in what just happened, The blood pouring from her nose the crying, tears down her face. I saw red &amp; grabbed CKB by the throat, pinning her to the fridge squeezing tightly all sound seemed distant as I am on autopilot just focused on wanting to end this persons existence, Abby's cries &amp; trying to talk stopped me as I got myself as calm as I could in that moment, panic set in as I ran to Abby''s side her tear filled eyes as I grab a towel tipping her head forward so the blood wouldn't go in her mouth. Out of nowhere a crazed  voice screamed ""BASTARD"" I turn to see her running into me, it doesn''t register what has taken place until I try and lift my arm pushing her away. there is a knife in my shoulder stummbling back I do something stupid &amp; pull the knife out &amp; stare at CKB I turn to leave with the knife in hand CKB shouted something I still can't remember as I was rushing to the hospital it was only a quarter mile away and it wasn't bleeding as heavily as it was when she cut my neck but was deep, I called CKB''s mother &amp; told her to get round there &amp; take Abby as I fill her in on what happened hanging up I see a text from CKB ""Can I have the knife back? its part of a set.""

&amp;#x200B;

Days later I get a call. Its Abby crying down the phone. it was her birthday &amp; I had been out of it with painkillers she asked me ""why I wasn't at her birthday party?"" telling me she loves the dress.  I break down a little hearing this,, but also hear whispering  too. Its CKB coaching her by the sound of it. I say ""put her on"" I gain my composure as I can hear her muttering ""idiot"" She screams down the phone as if I am in the wrong. I try to stay calm and explain something that should have been obvious ""We are through &amp; your lucky your not in jail for abusing your daughter &amp; trying to kill me"" hanging up I cried for a long time I don't usually cry but after 11 months it was finally over. I was crying more for Abby as until I met her I didn't think I'd be a good father &amp; she opened my eyes to what could have been. If only her mother wasn't a crazy bitch.

&amp;#x200B;

In the weeks that followed I had late night hang up calls, CKB ""crying &amp; threatening"" I change my number. a few days  later I find out CKB has been sectioned for stabbing her mother with a bottle opener &amp; Abby is now happilly living with her grandmother. 

&amp;#x200B;

(For those interested I did send the knife back to CKB in a bubble wrapped box a few days later) &amp; I am great friends with her ex bf to this day too &amp; it was her who gave him the black eye, Abby &amp; her grandmother since moved away I  am still friends with both  on FB to this day. As far as CKB I haven''t bothered to see if she''s still sectioned, alive or dead &amp; I really don't care either way.",SDamienH85,2019-03-21 10:55:37,1,1563,61.77,64.48,66.43,7.82,44.66,12.09,86.24,53.61,20.15,15.04,8,0.51,0.51,5.76,0.26,5.12,5.63,14.59,7.17,4.73,3.71,1.22,18.49,5.82,2.69,1.47,1.02,1.22,5.31,1.86,3.39,0.51,1.41,0.77,14.78,0.64,1.02,5.37,1.34,7.29,1.6,0.77,0.83,2.05,0.58,2.5,5.25,2.05,2.05,1.02,3.01,1.98,0.64,0,0.32,6.78,2.11,0.77,2.3,1.54,0.32,8.96,6.21,0.64,18.04,3.33,8.83,6.65,0.32,0.96,0.06,0.19,0.06,0.19,1.09,0.38,0.13,0.13,0.13,0.13,19.9,1.98,2.11,0,5.12,0.19,0.13,0,2.05,1.92,0.51,5.89
b3ue5k,Abusive Ex Lying to the Court,"I'll apologize ahead of time if this gets ramble-y.

My ex told me last May that he wanted a divorce. At first, I was absolutely devastated. I begged him to come to counseling and keep trying. He came to one session with me, and told the counselor he absolutely didn't want to be there and he was done. 

He moved into the basement, while I slowly tried to pick up the pieces of my life. He said he didn't want anything. He didn't want the house, the dog, etc. He wanted to live by himself in a one bedroom apartment. He made no efforts to move out of the basement for months.

I started to see how much healthier I felt without him, and his constant shouting, grabbing my by the wrists until they hut, and shoving me to the floor. I was ready to move on. I told him I thought it was time he moved out of the basement. It was early in August when he snuck into my room in the middle of the night and stole my cell phone. He read every message and even blocked some of my contacts. He decided he wasn't moving out and he didn't want a divorce anymore.

I was so shocked, I didn't know what to do. He stayed in the basement until early September when I told him I was really done and I wanted the divorce. He lost his mind. He shredded all of the pictures he could find of the two of us right in front of me. Then he went and got a hammer and smashed his wedding ring to pieces. He then threatened me and threatened to do the same to all of my belongings. 

I was so scared. I took the dog and left. I called a friend and stayed at their house. The Ex broke into my email and social media accounts and locked me out of everything. Over the next couple of weeks, he kept texting me at random hours of the night, sending flowers to my workplace, even messaging my second job on facebook to ask what my hours were. 

I filed a restraining order. I put our house address as my address. They removed him from the home, so I moved back in and changed the locks.  

A few weeks later, my mom came to visit and was staying with me. It was 2:30 in the morning when I heard her yelling from the living room. I rushed out of my bedroom to find her pushed over on the entryway stairs with my ex standing over her, holding her phone away from her. Somehow he had gotten into the locked front door, which he did not have keys for. I tried my best to calm him down and get him to leave, but he was not going for it. It one point, I reached for the phone and grabbed it away from him. I tried to dial 911, but he grabbed me around the neck and started choking me. My mom tried to pull him off of me, but he hit her in the faced and yelled at her to stop or he would squeeze even harder. My mom pushed past him and ran out the front door and started banging on the neighbor’s door. Hearing all of the noise she was making, he ran off. My mom came back and we called the police.

It took them 4 days to find him and arrest him. Then, they let him off on a PR bond the next day, meaning he didn't have to serve any initial time and didn't even have to put up any bail money. I've been so scared of him coming back, I haven' been able to stay in the house since. I have no doubt that if my mom hadn't been there, something much worse would have happened to me.

They're just now getting around to dealing with the criminal case. He took a plea deal, admitting he broke into the house, but he denies that he choked me or hit or shoved my mom. His story is he was just coming in to talk, and just tried to get past my mom and she fell on her own. And, he didn't choke me. He had his hands on my shoulders, trying to calm me down. He outright lied to the judge in court. His lawyer got the sentencing delayed, so he hasn't even been punished for any of this. Not that I believe he's going to get any punishment out of this, considering how terribly it's been handled so far.

And, now, they're trying to use his lies against me in the divorce. I'm just so defeated. I've been fighting to be free from him for over six months now, and he just won't let it stop. And to now deny the truth in court and know he's probably going to be believed? I'm just so upset. Thank you to anyone who read this whole thing. I just really needed to let it out.",Alexithymia85,2019-03-21 11:51:55,6,857,48.18,61.94,50.02,5.68,14.05,11.32,93.7,60.91,21.59,18.32,8.4,0.35,0.12,8.87,0.58,3.27,5.95,15.99,7.58,4.9,7.35,2.1,21.12,2.45,0.93,1.05,1.28,1.87,3.5,0.82,2.68,0.7,1.28,0.47,16.1,1.4,0.35,1.98,7.7,9.57,1.52,0.93,1.52,2.45,0.93,3.03,2.33,0.23,1.28,0.82,1.28,0.47,0.82,0,0,7.47,1.4,1.75,2.68,1.52,0.7,10.62,6.42,1.4,18.44,4.32,8.75,6.18,1.05,0.12,1.98,0.35,0,0,0.7,0,0,0.23,0,0,14.12,6.88,4.08,0.12,0,0.12,0,0.12,0,2.8,0,0

I believe they are married (from what I’ve heard). Earlier today, I heard something through our very thin walls. Sounded like she was laughing at first then it sounded like a cry of distress. I went to my roommate to listen and confirm, but then it was gone. Now, about half an hour ago, I’m relaxing before sleep, and I hear clear as day “leave me alone leave me alone”. I call downstairs to the concierge and tell them what happened, and to send security up. It was a terrifying shrill. Unmistakeable. I call back later while shake, and they say “oh well, they said they were sleeping”. I said well that’s a convenient alibi, but they weren’t budging! I know exactly what I heard.

b41jsg,Help for daughter with disabilities who can't care for children alone,"My daughter is 30. She has 2 children. One is 5 months, the other is 7 yrs. I recently got temp guardianship of the 7 yr old. The husband isn't his father. But the baby, he is her father. And he won't agree to us keeping her. 

They have been married a little over 3 yrs. Her husband is 30 yrs older than her. Her disabilites are very hard to explain, and I have never been able to find the correct help for her.
Her disabilites cause her to have bad behaviors that she thinks isn't bad (hard to explain) and she has burned bridges everywhere she has went.

She tried to live with us for the past 3 weeks with the kids. But, we just couldn't handle her so she went back to husband. She has no where to go.

Her disabilities make it hard for her to care for her children alone. It is a terrible situation that I stay sick over all the time. I feel so guilty that I can't just get along with her so I can help her.

Since the baby come, the violence has gotten worse. It's not so much physical as it is verbal, mental, emotional. Even though they do fight physically sometimes. They are ALWAYS arguing. SInce she went back this time, the husband will not let her out of his sight. He won't let her drive, won't let her use a phone. She can keep in touch with us, but he's always around.

b46of3,"Me [ 23F] and my boyfriend is [30M], he tried to stop me from leaving him by trying to "" impregnate me""..","My boyfriend and I have been dating one year, everything was amazing in the beginning, we were madly in love, I completely shut off my social life and spent most of my time in school. He saw that I had a bunch of guy friends I was close with. There was once I spent a whole day with my guy friends in the city just enjoying the day. There was or is no romantic connection between me and that guy. My boyfriend did not like the idea of me spending time with other guys. He wanted me solely for him. He wanted me to chose between him or my friends and I thought he was crazy. I cried because I didn't understand why he would ask that. He doesn't have any girlfriends he told me that it was cause they would only want him for one thing which was sex. He only had a few guy friends. Every time we went out to the club, his friends would always try to surround me as though they were my body guards and I personally do not like that, they were watching me like a hawk to make sure I'm not doing anything my boyfriend doesn't like( Mind you this was in the beginning of our relationship, about 3 months in). My boyfriend got more upset that I hugged my guy friends becoming more possessive and jealous. I've never experience that before. He got drunk telling me that he loves me and that he never wants me to leave him.

Months later, We go to Miami to enjoy our summer vacation together, he brought along his friends but we stayed in different rooms from him. Some people assumed I was his sister or something because of how short I am compared to him which made me feel a upset and he never noticed.... We went to go out for drinks, got inside this pool party and he got wasted. His friends were hitting on me and he was mad at me because I didn't want him on me because he was leaning on me too much and hes heavy. Through the night , after the party we called a cab, we got inside and once we got to the hotel. He wanted me away from him. Once we got inside the room, he started yelling and physically/emotionally abusing me. After that we left our separate ways.. We broke up.

Next month hit, he said we are not broken up, that he wants to make it up, I know you would expect me to not reply. I ended up giving him another chance.

He also got me promise ring during that month which I found kind of odd. Since it wasn't far from what happened in Miami, he told me he didn't remember anything but that he apologizes. Til this day I still feel and have that horror of a memory.

As months go by, he hasn't done anything to me except we got into an argument and he broke up with me.

We got back together afterwards. As it comes close to us making a year, I have started to realize how blinded I was for letting things go as if it was okay. i became fed up but then he shows me his sweet side and it comes back to me that love I saw when we met.

I've been having anxiety and depression but the support from him is not there he doesn't know how to be there but just becomes mad that he can't do anything. We gave each other space for a few weeks and he felt as though we were fading from what we had. We saw each other again and he tried to impregnate me because he was scared to lose me.

I've went to therapy, and also been asked why I'm with him. but it is because I love him and I'm scared I wouldn't meet somebody who cares about me as much as he does. Also I'm scared he would hurt me if I left

He always makes sure I'm okay and tries to be there for me.

He has told me before how he can't live without me and how he wanted to kill himself if I weren't around in the (past)

Sorry guys, I didn't mean to write so much, I was venting and I would appreciate your opinions and thoughts.

Thank you for reading !

TL;DR

My boyfriend wants us to work out and be better as a couple and he tried to impregnate me, Which I do not know how to react to that.  
The support and comments I am receiving, I really do appreciate it all. How would you leave this relationship? Through text? In person break up.

b46wz4,How do I increase my chances of RENEWING a criminal order of protection on my ex," (Illinois) I have a plenary order of protection on my ex for two years. It's been one year and my abuser has not bothered me. The order includes staying away from our son. He has two other kids with two other women that I think he sees regularly. My question is, will the judge deny renewing it if he hasn't bothered me? It is a criminal order of protection because he physically abused me multiple times and I'm so afraid he'll harass me or bother me once the order expires. I have ptsd from his abuse and suffer anxiety attacks, nightmares, and paranoia. I recently joined a support group to help me cope.

I’m in Indiana. I went to court and my ex did not show up. His lawyer did not show either...so my protection order was approved for myself and my son. 
 Then I got on mycase online and saw that he has already filed for a motion to modify it!!!! I have called the prosecutor every single day for a week and she will not respond to me as to if I can be at that court hearing or not. I’ve called the court and they do not know. It’s a grey area because I have not been served. Only reason I know is because it’s online. I don’t know what to do. Anyone been through this? Any advice?

b49ts7,When you've run out of agency's that are told they will help you where do you turn?,"A bit of a back story, my sister has now been stuck in an abusive relationship for well over a year. Her ""boyfriend"" has beaten her, destroyed her clothing, broken multiple phones of hers, spit on her, degraded her, cut off all contact with her kids, family and all social media, she's also been hospitalized and in and out of shelters because of him. She has even had to run NAKED into the street from her house to ask neighbours who happened to be outside for help. Since recently going to her house in attempts to speak to her, we were greeted by HIM at the door cursing and telling us we were trespassing and to get off his property when we we simply there to see my sister. We demanded to speak to my sister to tell us ourselves she didn't want us there. He then allowed her to come to the door and she looked TERRIFIED. Telling us that we should leave and that she didn't know who we were. I truly believe she was just telling us what he wanted her to say out of fear. This has happened in the past as well. After, we spoke to a neighbour who had already been watching us and immediately told us he did not want to get involved. When we had asked him if he could just tell us if he had seen anything going on at the house recently he told us there are CONSTANTLY police making visits to the house and he witnesses my sister ""run away"" on the regular, but her boyfriend always seems to bring her back. Keep in mind my sister is manic depressive, bipolar, probably off her medications, and had previously sent messages alluding to suicide.

Over the course of the year me and my family have contacted:

\-The first time my sister disappeared with her boyfriend for multiple days with no contact to anyone of her whereabouts or well being (after finding suicidal messages on her facebook messenger with her boyfriend that was logged in on our tablet at my mothers) we filled for a missing persons and spoke to the police on the phone who seemed extremely concerned, told us she was dispatching an officer to the house to get the details and to make sure we had a recent photo of my sister, copies of the messages, her boyfriends name, their address and the back story of what happened. Once the officer arrived he asked minimal questions, did not want to see any photos or take any important details or information, asked for their names and was gone within a few minutes.  
\- Called for a wellness check, to which they did not contact us back to to inform us of the outcome, we had to call them back after hours of waiting and we were told by the officer on duty that the officer dispatched had spoken to the man of the house who told him everything was fine. WITHOUT TALKING TO MY SISTER, who the wellness check was for.

Follow up  
\-After the police had done the wellness check we received multiple messages from my sisters boyfriend threatening harassment and slander charges though we had never said anything against his character or towards him, we had only added his name in my sisters missing person report

COAST Hamilton (Crisis Outreach And Support Team)  
\-Contacted them in hopes for help and told us since they are not in the same jurisdiction that we needed to contact COAST Niagara who would definitely be able to help us

COAST Niagara (Crisis Outreach And Support Team)  
\-Contacted them and they told us that they could help, took all of our information, but since their ride along worker wasn't in until noon suggested we call St Catherine's dispatch for an immediate wellness check which would then be seen by COAST Niagara who would then dispatch a police officer and an ambulance to remove my sister from the house  
\-(Wellness check) officer had gone to the house and there was no answer, very shortly after speaking to dispatch the police officer relayed to us he had TEXTED my sisters boyfriend to let him know that the police were looking for my sister. Which raised red flags because everything was supposed to be done without my sisters boyfriends knowledge to prevent the ABUSIVE boyfriend from getting angry and taking it out on my sister.  
\-COAST Niagara later called us back after finding out the wellness check didn't go as planned and that the officer shouldn't have gone to the house without the COAST worker, then proceeded to tell us that she needed to let us go so she could ""fix this""  
\-Four hours went by and we hadn't heard back from COAST, so we gave them a call and had to leave a message, later when she finally called us back her attitude towards the entire situation had shifted and she had told us that they were getting no response at the house and told us to go knock ourselves.   
\-That was the last we heard from the agency.  
(Remembering this a crisis intervention agency that is MEANT to intervene and remove the victim from the situation, ESPECIALLY when the victim has a mental illness and/or has suggested self harm. Both of which were the case and is why they were eager to help us in the first place.)

We have run out of resources and are now open to public suggestions, authority and organizations have consistently failed us to help our sister/daughter/mother. We just want her back.

I am trying to raise some money for my dear friend, Samantha. She married her high school sweetheart 15 years ago, and then set off to be a military wife. Her husband was injured during a deployment, and has not been the same since. His physical violence has escalated to a point where she must get herself and her three young daughters out, and start their lives over. Given that her husband is still active duty, things have been a challenge to say the least. I am trying to help her out financially with the move (From Ft Lewis in Washington to Ohio) and getting her back on her feet.

b4rw57,You don't need a Phd to know.,"Story time. So I don't know exactly around when, but things started to go south with my ex. When I say south, I mean a lot worse than usual. I had been living there for a couple months at that point and had been dating him for longer. He had always had these bad dreams that would wake him at night, but at some point he began getting angry at me every time he had these dreams. At first he would just wake me up by yelling, but then he began getting physical. A couple times I would wake up to the pain of him holding my down and shoving his knuckles or chin into my body. I would lie there and listen to him blame me for the bad dream he had. He was so mad, his spit would shower my face. I began getting worried about him. He was such a sweet guy and he had been in the military, so I really thought he had some sort of mental health issue. I thought PTSD had to be the culprit and I suggested him going to therapy, which he never did end up going to. One really bad morning, he was screaming and raving and threatening and I ran out of the house and decided that I would call his sister. I thought that maybe together, we could convince him to go to therapy. She came to the house, which I didn't expect. It was nice of her to do, or so I thought. I don't know what she said to him, but since that visit things got worse and worse. His dreams became a weekly nightmare. I kept updating his sister. I needed her to know. I didn't know who else could possibly convince him to get help. Finally after weeks I revealed to her what I had been thinking: I thought her brother was abusive, but I thought he could get better if we could just convince him to see it and go to some sort of group counciling. And just like that - I had lost her support completely. Apparently you need a degree to say someone is abusive.

I'm looking for other jobs in an area that has good public transportation because my parents never gave me the title to the car they gave me and took it back when I wouldn't move back into their house.

At the time, my cousin's brother wasn't living at the house. He and his then-girlfriend, now fiancee, moved back a few months ago. They have a history going back 3 years that I know of, but have currently been together about 7 months. They're both 21. 

He's been known to have anger problems all his life, but I didn't really know how bad they were until I lived with him. He has increasingly used intimidation tactics with his family and fiancee, and me occasionally, but he's still trying to put on a good face around me. He does things like punch holes into walls and throws shit when he's mad and screams at people until they're quiet.

Well, his fiancee came home tonight and he was pissed off that she had gone to a hockey game with her UNCLE and so he went out with his friends. She was bawling her eyes out and told me she needed to tell me so some stuff. 

She's really shaken up and she starts mentioning my cousin's brother. Knowing his history, and after telling my cousin that I think he uses abusive tactics, I had a feeling where this might go. So I make sure we go outside, somewhere private, even though she keeps talking too loudly. 

But she proceeds to tell me how he pushes her into walls, gets angry when she won't have sex with him every day, and that when she has tried to leave him before he has blocked her way out and threatened her pet in front of her. She talks about how much she loves him, but she can't take it anymore. 

I immediately ask her if there's somewhere safe for her to go. But her entire family is dope addicts, and she's clean off it. She says there's not, that she doesn't have any friends.  

I want to help her, but I'm not a therapist, and my only experience is getting out of my own abusive situation. Apparently landing smack middle in another one. 

I tell her there's this thing called a safety plan, and there are professionals that can talk her through it, or she can talk to her therapist about it. I tell her about the DV hotline. 

I offer to help her, even though that puts me in a precarious situation if he finds out I'm doing so. To put money into an account for her that he doesn't know about. To take her with me to ""run errands"" and then drop her off somewhere safe. But if I do that, I still need to return their car. I really don't know if my cousin's family would protect me from her brother. I would hope so, but is there any greater set of blinders than when it comes to your own son or brother?

I want to mention it to my cousin, but when I told her I think he has the capability to be physically abusive, she couldn't believe it. 

It feels selfish to want to distance myself, but my instinct right now is to run away from everything even though I only have enough saved up for a couple months of living expenses when you take into account that most places ask for 3 months rent upfront (first, last, deposit). The job I'm working at now requires a car and it's in an area that is too expensive. I have a close friend I can stay with, but it's a last resort. Also, he likes me, and it would make me feel uncomfortable.

My plan is to keep being proactive about finding a job, now probably spending most of my free time doing so. 

Am I a bad person for putting my safety above that of someone I know is being physically abused? How do I help her while putting myself in the least danger?

I didn't make a safety plan when I left my parents' house and had $5 to my name. I have more resources now, and I know I have to be smarter about it this time.

I know this is super long, but there's a lot to this situation.",sunsetiscalling354,2019-03-23 20:27:24,2,886,12.22,58.04,64.63,11.24,18.46,13.88,96.05,61.29,24.15,18.06,9.59,0.11,0.23,7.45,0.68,5.76,3.39,12.53,10.05,8.47,8.58,1.92,20.43,2.6,1.58,2.03,1.35,2.26,4.97,1.92,3.05,0.34,1.92,0,17.27,3.39,1.02,5.19,3.61,11.85,2.37,1.47,1.92,2.71,0.79,3.84,1.24,0.34,0.45,0.34,2.37,0.45,1.69,0.11,0,9.14,4.63,1.47,1.24,1.24,1.35,4.74,14.22,1.24,16.82,3.5,7.34,6.77,1.13,0.79,1.47,1.13,0,0,0.45,0.23,0.11,0,0.11,0,15.58,5.08,4.51,0,0,0.34,0,0.23,0.23,4.4,0.68,0.11
b4sj7x,Boyfriend Choked Me Last Night,"My boyfriend and I have been together for one year. I am 19 and he is 24. It wasn't til about six months in that verbal abuse started happening. While there were signs/red flags I ignored them because I thought I was in love. He talked about how he had been manipulative in the past to one of his ex's and I thought the openness was to come clean and show remorse. I grew up in a volatile and abusive home. I was isolated and I only have one person I have remained friends with since highschool. It was a fairly small school so my friend pool was never huge to begin with and growing up I wasn't allowed to go over anyone's house. I didn't get any freedom til about 16 when I started working and even then it was limited. But that's another story. At 13 I was hospitalized for attempting suicide for about a month and at 14 my first ""real"" boyfriend sexually assaulted me then cheated on me. I confided a lot of my trauma into my boyfriend because I thought he was someone I could love and trust. At first the verbal abuse only happened during arguments of him calling me a stupid bitch, slut, cunt, etc. Any bad name he could think of. At the end of fights I would end up always apologizing first (still do) because he would tell me it was my fault and that he wouldn't be angry if it weren't for me. I started self-harming again something I had proudly been clean of for two years because I didn't know how to cope with the fights and he always convinced me that I was the problem. Then he started telling me I was the worst girlfriend and that he was going to go to other people or download tinder. I couldn't make any new friends because he would tell me I was just using them for my entertainment. (I would go on online forums looking for new people to talk to and maybe befriend because I am at an out-of-state college and haven't really met anyone that I click with enough to be friends. My one and only friend is 1,000 miles away back in my home state.) He would make me feel bad for reaching out and talking to anyone.   


If we got into a fight and I would confide in my friend which I openly told my boyfriend about because I didn't want him to think I was bad mouthing him I just wanted advice. He would freak out and tell me I was trying to make him look like the bad guy. But he would contact his friends and he would tell me he was leaving to go live with them. That he didn't want me or need me. He messaged his ex and he told me he openly messaged her because he knew it would upset me because again I had been cheated on + was/am super insecure. I saw it on his twitter account that we were sharing at the time because I was managing his social media. After that situation he started making an improvement, promised me it would never happen again. I believed him. Then he got worse again out of the blue and told me it was my fault and that he was stuck at a job he hated because of me. He started calling me a leech and saying I spent all his money. Then failed to produce any evidence I spent anything because it was entirely all him with the exception of a DLC he told me to buy for myself. I was lazy, I'd never amount to anything, worthless, etc. Because he works while I am at college so I sit on my ass all day and mooch. (My meals / housing are included in tuition there is nothing he needs to pay for.) The ONLY reason I am not working is because I didn't get any interviews here and at this point I am transferring back to my home state with only a month left there is no point. I already have two jobs lined up for when I get home and for college I have work study. I tried to stay supportive and be positive while he told me I wasn't going to work when I moved back that I was just going to mooch off of him. (He's living in my moms house so he can get on his feet.) I figured he was just upset in the situation he was in and was just projecting.   


Then it got to the more personal stuff and attacking things that really actually get me going. My mother tried to kill herself after my stepdad cheated on her. I was about 15 and my stepdad told me it was my fault. She was hospitalized for about two weeks and it was awful. It still makes me cry thinking about how scary that was because despite my mother not being very motherly I love her. That is my mom. During one argument my boyfriend told me ""No wonder your mother tried to kill herself to get away from you. I would to."" He knew that my stepdad said that to me and that it really hurt. I thought this was the straw that broke the camels back but I still somehow forgave him. How stupid I was because a few days later he told me ""Your mom was right to tell you to kill yourself."" and ""You don't deserve anyone."" Again my mother wasn't motherly growing up she had her own mental issues and during the time I was hospitalized she told me   
1. ""Go ahead and kill yourself. See if I care."" During a time I told her I wanted to relapse.   
2. ""Don't stay with her she doesn't deserve anyone."" She said this to my father the night I was hospitalized. My dad thankfully still stayed but my mom just left me.   
And yet again I still fucking forgave him. I don't know why. I just keep holding onto things getting better.   


So last night. My boyfriend has been here for about a week and a half out of a two week trip. We had been in our AirBnB the whole day. (College dorm has 3 night limit on overnight guests.)  He was depressed and I figured it was from being cooped up all day as he had said he wanted to do something. So I decided we could go out and do whatever at 11pm which meant getting McDonalds and browing a Walmart. I asked if he'd be interested and he said yes and got dressed. When we got there he kept telling me how much he hated it and that it was pathetic we were at a Walmart ""browsing"" when we should be looking at expensive things. I ask him to stop being so negative and just enjoy it because hey we are together and it might seem a little silly but not much else is open and clubs aren't really our thing. He just got worse. I got annoyed, I won't lie, and said well then lets just go back to the AirBnB and I'll drop you off to find parking. The car ride was silent and when I got to the AirBnB he told me don't text, don't call, etc. And I was very confused and it got me extra annoyed so I said alright and drove down the road to cool down. Texted him saying I'd be at my dorm which wasn't far away. I remembered my laptop was at the AirBnB which I needed for homework. Texted him again saying I needed my laptop and could he please bring it out because there was no parking except for reserved which I didn't have any right to. Even if I wanted to get in he had the keys to the AirBnB. Tells me the front door is unlocked and I head in trying to just go in and out before I got my ass towed. I get up to the bedroom door which he locked. He unlocks it and blocks me from getting my stuff. I ask him to move and he refuses. So I pushed past him which wasn't the wisest idea. I wasn't in the right mindset myself and I regret it. I just focused on getting my stuff. When I got past him he grabbed me then shoved me into the wall. Then he threw me on the bed and stared choking me telling me I would never be anybody and that he should've left me. I didn't know what to do. I laid on the bed in shock and he locked the door. I got up and grabbed my laptop. Asked him for the keys so I could get into the AirBnB later and grab my stuff. I should've just left but I was emotional and hurt and I just don't know what was going through my head. He didn't want to give the keys and I just was crying and begging for the keys. He kept hitting my hand and grabbing me because I was holding my hand out for the key. I wasn't in his face and I wasn't screaming or fighting I just wanted the keys. He ended up grabbing me and choking me out again at which point he just threw the keys at me after and I left. I sat in the Walmart parking lot crying because there was no way I would have made the drive back to my dorm safely in hysterics. I called my friend told him what happened and we talked until I finally calmed down.  I came back the next day (today) to just grab my stuff and make peace. He told me he didn't feel bad. That he warned me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to feel. I don't want to say I was innocent in the beginning for our fights because I definitely would argue back and be just as vicious with the name calling. But I improved and became more of a pacifist because he convinced me the fights were my fault. I did everything he said I should do to prevent a fight from happening. I just wanted us to work. He showed me patience in the beginning when I would break down about my home life and I left one shitty place to go to another, He would tell me I was more important to him than any fight. And now I feel like a pushover, voiceless, powerless. All I seem to ever do is cry, beg, and plead for him to stop and forgive me. He never takes any blame for anything and tells me it's me who never owns up to anything. He tells me I don't deserve apologies. And when I talked to him today he pretended like nothing happened. When I got an answer out of him he told me he didn't feel bad. I always thought I'd be the one to just run out and call the cops if anyone ever laid their hands on me. My dad drilled into me that if a man ever puts his hands on me to just leave. I feel like its my fault but I also know logically I couldn't be to blame for everything. I am scared. I have invested so much into someone. He goes back to my home state in a few days and he is going to be back living at my moms house. I don't know how to get rid of him or kick him out. I am scared to get the police involved. I just want him gone. I want this to be over. I just don't know. I just wanted to put this here to vent. I figured I'd wait til I was back in my home state and just tell him he needed to leave my mothers house where I'd be going back to. I don't know. I wish I could stop saying that but I really don't know how to go about leaving him for fear of it getting violent.",ThrowAway_2239,2019-03-23 21:39:46,3,2054,13.92,38.5,70.3,2.38,15.56,12.51,94.94,63.44,24.68,19.91,12.76,0.68,0.39,5.89,0.19,4.77,3.75,12.41,9.83,6.52,8.47,2.78,22.44,2.48,1.02,1.66,1.31,1.41,6.04,1.66,4.33,0.39,1.85,0.68,14.7,0.88,0.93,1.22,5.99,12.61,2.48,2.14,2.82,2.24,1.22,2.78,2.19,0.49,0.78,0.93,1.46,0.58,0.54,0.15,0.05,7.89,2.24,1.36,1.8,1.56,1.12,9.83,8.62,1.02,14.9,2.34,6.82,6.43,1.46,0.19,1.07,0.49,0,0.24,0.73,0.39,0.05,0.15,0.05,0,11.68,6.38,0.83,0,0.1,0,0,0.15,0.68,2.68,0.58,0.29
b4u1dn,How do I stop the cycle?,"I (26F) have been in an abusive relationship (30M) for 8 years. We have two children under 5 years old. The lies, control, and manipulation are always there. However the physical abuse is spread out, maybe 2 or 3 times a year. I have two voices in my head. The reasonable one that knows I can’t do this anymore and I need to get out. And then there’s also the other voice that I’ve listened to for so long, that it isn’t that bad, that the kids need their parents together, that I can’t make it without him, financially, and otherwise. Who would help me with the kids, who would watch them while I work, where could I find a job that pays more so I can save up for my own apartment to finally leave. I know this is the abused voice inside of me. I crave his love even though I know he could never love me. I know this sounds stupid if you haven’t experienced it. But I’m hoping there’s other here that have been through the same and can maybe share insight, tips, books, resources. Anything that’ll help. How do I retrain my brain to listen to the reasonable side? How do I learn to love myself more than I love him? I can’t afford to see a therapist but I know there’s some deep healing I need... especially in regards to why I accept this “love.” I can feel the tiny voice creeping in that it would be easier to suck it up, move forward, store away my anger and pretend like everything is normal. Until he blows up on me again months from now. How can I keep my reasonable voice the only one I hear? especially if I have to live with him for a little longer until I can save some funds.

Domestic abuse is so complex and difficult to understand. I have been with this person for 8 years. I care immensely for him and yet he often treats me like actual garbage. He is emotionally, verbally and physically abusive and I haven't told a soul about it in 8 years because I am so ashamed. At this point, I am more angry at myself than I am with him for allowing this to keep happening, but as much as I know this is wrong and bad, I keep subconsciously justifying his behaviors to myself.

b55e7f,Today is my birthday.,"Today’s my birthday. Today is also the day I left my abusive husband. Tonight, instead of going out with friends and family to celebrate, I’m curled around my sleeping toddler- feeling incredibly grateful that we are finally somewhere safe, but also deeply grieving the loss of my home, and everything I hoped for with a man I truly did love. And I know- I know the pathology of abuse, I know that’s how they get their hooks in you- but it doesn’t make how I felt any less real, just like it doesn’t make the pit in my stomach any less bottomless. And that’s ok. That’s just where I am right now, and that’s ok. 

I stand by leaving. It was absolutely the right thing to do. I just never realized how much grief, loss, heartbreak, and homesickness I would feel. He made a lot of promises to change, and after he was arrested for punching me it actually seemed like his rock bottom. For a short time there I truly thought he was genuinely changing. This weekend taught me that he isn’t- he still relies on blame shifting and intimidation to tear me down. 

I never thought I would spend my birthday like this. Tomorrow I’ll get up and get to work on rebuilding a life without him. But for tonight? I’m just going to hold my daughter, and grieve for the father she should have had. 

Love and peace to you all

b57u8r,How can I make money secretly and hide it to escape an abusive relationship in which my abuser controls 100% of the finances?,"Excuse the throwaway, I’m monitored nearly constantly.

I’ve been trying to get out of an emotionally and physically abusive relationship for years now but money is always the reason why I have to stay.
 
Some costs to consider:
• $2000 minimum for a security deposit for an apartment in my state
• money for transportation/ to buy a vehicle (he won’t let me have a car or drive)
• money for food
• money for a hotel/ somewhere to stay immediately until I get a place 

Some hurdles:
• I don’t know anyone/ have any real friends (only work aquantences I barely know) in this state
• no vehicle
• I have a job and work all the time but he has complete control of my bank account
• can’t switch my paycheck to another account because he checks it all the time and would notice immediately if something was wrong
• can’t hide cash anywhere in my house, he always finds it and punished me for withholding money from him, even if I say I was trying to surprise him with a gift. I only ever saved $100 before he found it. 


Gotta go, don’t have much time. Will try to respond but if I can’t i’ll Just read responses safely from my main.

Is this normal?,"I was severely assaulted on Fri evening by my husband, he was arrested and has repeater charges pending, also is on parole for previous battery charges (so most likely will be revoked). So he's not going anywhere and I will be getting a temporary RO and filing divorce papers today. I had literally five minutes worth of shame, guilt, feeling sorry for him and then something in me just... changed. I feel really good. Like REALLY good, 9.5 out of 10. Im SUPER sore physically, but that whole emotional rollercoaster sh*t show that I've experienced in the past is gone. I'm not even angry or ""feeling violated"" kind of rage. 
The only thing I can kind of compare it to is when I was a kid and my mom was right on the edge of losing her mind with us kids and would look happy or laugh, but we all kind of scattered because we knew she was going to crack. Idk, I am really happy he is where he is and im safe and I don't have to plan my days and nights around his moods or solve his problems or do literally anything for him at all.

b5at97,I’m being punished for asking for too much reassurance,"I took my husband of six years back. He was in jail for two years. He contacted me and I slowly let him back in. My dad was helping me pay my rent but now that I have taken him back he won’t help me and we have almost no where to go. We might have to go live with his dad but we did that once before and they ended up fighting and us getting kicked out so I’m worried.

My husband was being so kind to me these past few months but now he rages against my father for leaving us homeless and not “supporting my marriage” and when I get feel discouraged by this or by our prospects he ignores me. Yesterday I tried to explain to him that I need him to hear my concerns and address them so I feel like we are on the same page and he just squirmed out of it. He told me I’ll never get him to say exactly what I want to hear. That I’m being too forceful and that he already addressed these concerns so he shouldn’t have to again. I want our daughter to finish the school year here and he doesn’t care and thinks I’m being arbitrary. My feelings are an inconvenience to him. He yells at me over things I have no control over or am actively trying to fix. I stopped the other day and said “why are you talking to me like that?” He said it’s his personality and to get over it. Now that my dad knows and I have nowhere to turn to on my own he is being so mean to me again. 

Why does he even keep begging for me to take him back when he seems like he can’t stand me???",DNAsplicelatte,2019-03-25 06:39:23,3,312,5.31,63.79,57.38,20.88,18.35,12.5,96.47,68.91,28.85,23.72,12.18,2.56,0.32,8.01,0.64,5.13,1.28,14.1,10.26,8.65,8.33,2.88,23.72,1.6,1.6,1.92,0.96,0.64,4.17,1.92,2.24,0.32,1.28,0.32,18.59,2.56,0,0.32,9.94,10.26,2.56,1.28,1.28,2.24,0.96,2.88,2.88,0,1.92,0.96,0.32,0,0.32,0,0,9.94,3.85,0.64,3.21,2.24,0.32,5.45,15.06,1.28,13.78,1.6,5.45,8.33,0.64,0,0.64,0.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.26,4.49,0,0,0,1.28,0,0,1.28,3.21,0,0
b5bago,was my ex abusive?,"I'm newly out of a emotionally manipulative relationship but now I'm starting to think I may have been so mind-fucked that I didn't realize I was physically abused either. The first time he did this we were at a friends house and I was standing there, and he came up to me and put his hand around my neck and shoved me so hard against an electric box that it opened. He apologized and said ""I was just being kinky."" I believed him but i thought it was strange that he was engaging in kink behavior when there was no sexual activity going on and other people were present. Later, he would start choking me during arguments, slapping me, groping me in public, groping me in my sleep, and finally even penetrating me in my sleep. I believed him when he gave me his line: ""I just like that I can do kinky stuff with you."" I'm newly diagnosed with Acute Stress Disorder and every day I'm remembering more of these instances. He would tell me I was stupid, or just to shut up if I tried to talk about my feelings. He would trash my apartment and then tell me I was disgusting (when it was clean when he wasn't around). He told me he had ""psychic dreams"" and that he was born a Shaman. Is any of this normal? I feel like I've been much more abused then I think I have been.

b5fzb2,Just a little piece of my heart,"So I (38)m am a victim of domestic abuse. It's taken a lot for me to come to grips with this term. I recently ended a on going 6yr partnerships if you will with my daughters mother. We had been off and on for about 6 years mostly because I wanted to be a major part of my daughters life for as long as I could and chose to put her and my stepdaughters needs ahead of mine. I have two prior failed marriages and a son with each of them. My first marriage was by not part my fault or nor did I ever intend to divorce however my X had other plans. My second wife and I split because of her violent nature when she was drinking and well we were more friends than anything anyways. I currently have good relations with them and my two sons. However this time it may be a little different. I never wanted to go through having another child and watching someone else play father to my children, it has been hard enough with my sons so I tried my best with my daughters mother.
    Two yrs ago we got back together because she was in pinch and needed help with bill money and I gladly stepped back into the role after a long split and her going to jail for assaulting me once already. I assumed she had learned her lesson and boy was I wrong! Her daughter from prior needed to go to a better school and I agreed to work two jobs to make the ends meet and allow her not to have to work to drive her daughter to school and take care of our daughter because she was not in school yet. We agreed in the beginning that she would do her and I would do me and as long as the girls didn't see it or  no one would be brought to our home we agreed to co-parent for the girls best interest and this worked for the most part however lines always get blurry and she always claimed to have feelings for me.
     I am a painter by day and a bartender by night... it seemed that my bar job always caused major issues for her. When I would come home late she would be ready always for a fight. Even though we had our agreement she always wanted control over everything I did and it grew tiresome. The fights late at night got more violent to the point of her taking my keys from me and putting the keys between her fingers as she punched me. Here is the part I had a hard time with..... I'm 6'2 and 220 she is 5'2 and 115 lbs.... it degraded every inch of my manhood to realize I was cowering to a person half my size and weight. Had she of been a man... well that person would still be in a hospital. I took the abuse and her"" I'm sorry""  the next day for as long as I possibly could. She broke several cell phones when I mentioned calling the law, she even went as far as head butting the walls and hitting herself, she scared the shit out of me!!! 
     Fast forward to today.... we have been separated for several months now and I had to put a restraining order against her for multiple reasons. However this has left me... without a car and without being able to see my daughter and stepdaughter and that breaks my heart. I recently visited New Orleans and walked by a few bars on bourbon street and her the song sweet caroline playing in three different ones and I literally went back to the room and well ....had a bad night.

b5gjiz,Just some tips for anyone that are still in the DV relationship,"So I was reading a post about calling 911 and “ordering pizza” when you’re in a bad situation. 

That won’t work a lot of the time. Most of the time, in my opinion. 

First of all, why would you call for a pizza in the middle of a fight/argument? And secondly, your abuser may have all of the control over your money. This is from my personal experience. 

If you can, hide a set of keys outside somewhere. My abuser will take mine when he’s getting crazy. I’ve resorted to hiding them in my vagina at times. He caught on to that and now I keep my keys in my shoe. There’s only one now as I don’t have a car. My vag is doing ok don’t worry. 

Have a spare purse/bag hidden close to the door with a few bucks, meds, etc. If you have to run out of the house at least you have something. 

When you need to call for help, dial the emergency number and just put it in your bra or pocket. DONT LET THEM GET YOUR PHONE. Do not hang up. Whisper as much info as possible when you can. And if youre arguing, then say whatever is happening. And say it loudly. 

I’ve done this too many times. Most recently was when my bf was trying to pour my blood pressure meds down the sink. I pretend that I don’t know where my keys are. I pretend that I don’t know where my phone is. 

Stay safe and I am happy for all of you that got out of this mess. I have so much more to say but I’m afraid that I’m breaking the rules.

b5q6u0,"Did your abuser ever try to mask their actions as ""accidents""?","An incident happened between me and my partner last night in which his fist went into my face during an argument, but it was masked as an accident (his arm slipped trying to do something else). He wasn't overly concerned and instead wanted to argue about the wording I used to describe the incident (I called it a punch because it was a closed fist and caused my eye to water and swell, but he called it a tap). 
I am suspicious it was more than that after an escalation in his emotional abuse recently, and an outburst a few weeks ago in which he broke our exercise equipment, but I don't want to make more out of this than it might be if it was just an accident.

b5saiq,Emotionally Drained,"Hey all, I'm a 25 year old female. About 2 years ago I got into a relationship with someone who I thought was just a total catch. He was super attractive, talented musician, and for some reason liked me (self-esteem issues are clearly part of the problem). From the very beginning he cheated on me and lied to me, but for whatever reason I decided to fight to keep him. Apart from that however, he still made me feel like I was the most gorgeous, important person in the world (when we were together). A month into the relationship we moved in together, because his mother wanted him out of the house. I couldn't understand what the big deal was. 

Fast forward a year into the relationship. I've realized that he is an alcoholic who becomes violent when drunk. In fact, he's started to become violent when not drunk too. I can't seem to say anything without a fight breaking out which is inevitably blamed as my fault. Meanwhile, I'm the only one working (for the past year) and pay all rent and all bills and am now 30k in debt because of it. He's stolen my credit cards, pawned my items, etc. He's still cheating on me, and his violence is escalating. 

Fast forward to now. I finally ended the relationship a few months ago. I have held steadfast to that. He tried to use his sweetness and all of his tools to get me back, but I had reached my breaking point and refused to do it. (Not to mention I had 0 sexual attraction to him anymore and sex felt like I was being violated). 

We still live together however, and I can't get rid of him. He's seeing someone else and is working (so he is finally paying me for rent). His aggression and violence are still there though. Every time he gets mad he breaks part of the house that is being rented in MY name. (Today it was part of the door frame and he stabbed a wall). He also kicked me, shoved me, and grabbed my face really hard with his fingers and licked it from bottom to top (wtf????). 

I did some research on how to get him out legally, but unfortunately he does have rights since he's been living there for over 30 days and has received mail. It seems the only legal route is to get the actual landlord involved and to have him file a motion to evict him, but I'm concerned that I'll be evicted and charged extra fees in the process (I have 4 animals that aren't supposed to be there.. oops). He doesn't have enough money to be able to easily afford a place on his own, and he has no discipline  to save up so that he can move. He's too busy blowing his money on alcohol, and I feel like he knows I'm his safety net and is afraid to be out on his own without me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do. Every day I just feel more and more emotionally drained. The things he says to me, the way he makes me feel with everything he does, it just really hits me harder than I ever thought it would. I've gained 80 pounds, I feel like crying all the time, my self esteem which has never been high has dropped to almost 0. And aside from all of that, there are so many more feelings and emotions that I just can't even put a finger on. I just don't know what to do.",MoreThanMight,2019-03-26 10:05:45,3,607,27.1,45.41,50.58,11.01,16.41,14.17,91.43,59.8,20.1,15.16,7.91,0.49,0,6.75,0,4.94,5.11,12.85,10.87,7.25,6.92,2.31,18.78,3.62,2.14,1.98,1.32,3.46,5.11,1.81,2.97,0.16,1.81,0.16,12.03,0.16,0,0.33,6.75,12.36,3.46,1.48,0.66,1.65,2.47,3.29,2.97,0.16,0.49,1.98,1.98,0.49,0.66,0.33,0.82,5.93,1.65,1.48,1.48,1.15,0.49,5.11,13.01,0.16,13.84,1.81,6.59,6.75,1.48,0.99,1.15,1.81,0,0,0.33,0.16,0.16,0,0,0,17.79,6.1,4.12,0,0.33,0.66,0,0.16,0,3.46,2.64,0.33
b5sqhd,Romance turned into domestic,"Oddly enough I’m in the wrong; go figure.
Alright, so this wonderful story is your stereotypical “I must follow my heart” bullshit. I’m not proud of myself for what I’ve done (let me just put that out there, because I was painfully led on and learned my lesson.) 

I left my 3 year engagement, my decent paying job, and my fully furnished 3 bed/2 bath house; for this cock boy who catfished me over the internet by doing n o t h i n g but whispering sweet sweet things I only wanted to hear in my dumbass stretched lobes. 

The fact that I knew this could’ve gone terribly wrong was thrown into the wind when my grandmother passed; I quit my job on New Year’s Eve and I told my partner that I wished the best for him as I were to leave about a week from then to Louisiana to which is, a painful 14 hours away. Completely away from all family; no friends, just the clothes I could get away with packing and my pc parts (which I bought to put together). 

I again; ignored my pleas from my family and my loved ones and went with it anyways as I stepped into his car at about 3:00 in the morning. Almost an instant regret. Not only was I mocked for my clothes but he was extremely inconsiderate about packing my items away in the car. Remind you; I have my pc parts ready to go. He just throws em in there. I know I know, I get what you’re thinking; “you’re such a piece of shit for what you did and now you want to complain about how you ran off and had your shit packed”.


You know I really don’t care at this point. The mental torment I endured was too much to make me care for the opinions of others. Especially when the stereotypical thing for an abuser like him to do was to deny everything; and of course gaslight me into making it my fault. I do in fact need therapy after this. 

Fast forward about 3 or 4 weeks, im pregnant. His sister and mother hates me, we’re getting ready to move into an apartment with his dingy ass sister and her boyfriend (her who is jobless and the other who is a fucking subway sandwich artist) great right? All the while my brain is on a constant Radiohead’s “just” from morning light; to groggy shitty Louisiana smelling night foul. 

I did really do this to myself; I practically ruined my life and burnt my energy to the ground. I’m hopeless; as the non stop fights between me and him start to outbreak; his sister starts in. She accuses me of theft within the household and begins to make her small apartment room, into a hoarding situation with all the kitchen utensils, bowls, plates what have you because she was so convinced I was stealing. The most immature things that one can do to another to make one just so angry and annoyed, was done. 
And I was the one who was overreacting, I was the one taking it too personal, and I was obviously in the wrong. Go figure right? 

There’s no consideration for this unborn child inside of me, as for when I came to him with my positive test he told me; “ we need to go to boost mobile to get my new phone”. No excitement, no hugs or sympathy; not a single ounce of emotion towards the situation. 
The dull started to turn to anger towards me, I would start to suffer from morning sickness and he would be inconsiderate and try to either sleep with me, or argue with me. What human argues with someone who is almost 2 months pregnant while they’re face first into a toilet? Why would you try to fuck me after I threw up my body weight???? How in any sense is that logical or let alone ok. 

The endless arguments over literally every topic under the sun, and things that are “wrong with me” and things “I need to work on” got to me, made me more exhausted than I already was.
I was terrified; of everything. Of him and what the next thing I would do wrong would be. I sat in a room for 3 months straight, not allowed to walk outside for “you’ll get abducted”, ridiculed for my pregnancy cravings; and denied communication towards other; even yelled at about “how I should’ve warned him that my mother was on the phone”.

I wasn’t able to shower alone, he was convinced the apartment maintenance man installed cameras into our room to watch us, and that it was acceptable for me to go home 6 months pregnant; to endure a 14-15 hour drive. Accusing me of cheating on him whilst I was home, online and in person. It was never ending and really started to crush me deeper than I’ve ever felt in my life.

I had my last straw when he tailgated me from home from a walk and grabbed me aggressively, I needed air. I didn’t want to look at his fucking face while he stonewalled me for the 30th time today. Only to break the silence about how it’s of course, my fault. I was done. I called my mother up in tears ready to assemble for my escape to come home. 3 people participated in my escape to come home for safety, and those three people mean the absolute world to me for I would’ve surely ended up actually slitting my wrists in the bath. 

They’re 2 days out and I’m desperately trying to keep my phone either off and on silent mode so he can’t figure me out; I lay in constant fear and anticipation for my mother to save me from this personal prison; if not my purgatory of upmost unending sadness. The day of reckoning has came; I throw literally all my belongings including myself from the window while he’s at work. Waiting, shaking and wheezing while my mother and team is 20 minutes out; the fear in my bones he might catch me and do something I couldn’t even imagine. 

She pulls up into the drive and my mouth goes completely dry; I pull my 40 pounds of clothes into my hands and sprint across the complex ready to leave, the others pulling as much into their hands into the back of the car as well. 
I sit and wheeze in relief, I’m safe and I begin to have a complete breakdown. 

The suffering I’ve endured of mental trauma will reside in the back of my mind until the end of time, the harassment following he gave my family and friends as well. All the screenshots and threats have been recorded and I unfortunately have miscarried from the stress. 

I hope those who’re in the same situation that I’ve encountered, not trust a devil in disguise who promises a bigger and better life; when you had everything to begin with. You can call me selfish, any name under the sun; what have you. But this has been a nightmare that I will never, and I mean never will endure ever fucking again.

b5zegy,Confused Abused Male,"Hi Everybody,

I've never posted to reddit before but I'm having a hard time finding a place online to ask these questions. I found a few domestic abuse forums but they all were strictly for women.

I'm a 6'4, 250 lb man who is married to a fairly normal sized woman. In the past six years she has hit me at least six times. That is counting the ones I blocked but not counting pushes and shoves or the time she punched a hole in the wall.

They didn't hurt physically; I'm pretty sturdy. I love my wife and our six year old son and I didn't want to blow up his little world over some punches that didn't hurt me. Recently, though, I've been forced to face the reality that this is an abusive relationship, and started to deal with the emotional damage those hits have been doing all along.

Our son doesn't know this yet but we have agreed to seperate and she will be moving out of our house soon. I guess we'll tell him as soon as we have her move out date confirmed. That's what is eating me up, though. I'm in therapy right now to deal with my own issues from all of this, but I feel like I'm doing what is right for me at the expense of my little boy. All my friends and family tell me that I'm doing the right thing but it doesn't feel that way.

Has anyone been through anything similar? I know I'm not the only man who was ever hit by his wife, but I feel very alone in this.",aurelfell,2019-03-26 20:23:30,13,278,24.58,44.28,93,4.21,17.38,9.71,91.37,58.99,22.3,14.75,9.35,2.16,0,2.52,0.72,7.55,5.76,12.23,13.31,3.6,6.47,2.88,20.5,3.96,2.52,1.44,2.16,2.52,4.32,1.08,3.24,0.36,1.08,1.08,14.03,2.16,0.72,2.88,3.24,14.03,2.88,0.36,0.36,3.24,2.52,5.4,2.16,0,0,2.16,1.8,0.36,0.72,0,0.36,6.83,5.04,0,1.44,0,0.36,4.32,12.95,1.44,15.11,1.44,7.55,6.12,0,0.72,1.08,0.36,0,0,0.36,0,0.36,0,0,0,14.75,5.04,2.88,0,0.36,0.36,0,0,0,6.12,0,0

b619fi,His Therapist Contacted Me...,"So I am oscillating between being livid and having a panic attack right now.  


Background: My ex fiancé was abusive, emotionally financially and physically.  It accumulated to the point where he strangled me in a drunken rage that caused me to flee the country back to my home country.  He threw a large chunk of a firewood at me a few days before that incident and tried to pass it off as a joke.  He would either take away my credit cards, or threaten to take them away, knowing I had no access to money because “he was the one earning money” (newsflash, fucker, I wasn’t making money because I was awaiting on my PR and work permit.  I legally could not work and I gave up a very lucrative career to move with your sorry ass back to your home country).  He had no respect for my physical boundaries and often hurt me while ‘play wrestling’ with me.  


You know, just all around a charming guy. 
When I left he kept trying to contact me via friends, family, and my email.  I ignored all his attempts to contact me.  He got my friends and family really freaked out when he threatened to get a warrant issued against me because I took my dog with me.  Fun fact, the police don’t care. 

 He sent an email to me telling me in heart-felt words that “he wasn’t going to go to the police about the dog” making it seem like he had a change of heart.  He also posted this gem on reddit “the last time I called the non-emergency number (reporting a dog stolen) I got yelled at by the operator for wasting police resources.”  They certainly weren’t going to issue a warrant.  I knew that.  I’ve discharged warrants over fucking coffee breaks.  But the people close to me didn’t know that. So I had the annoying task of calming them all down and requesting them to not engage, to simply ignore or block him. I have gone completely no contact.  I thought he was finally going to leave me alone. 


So what’s got my goat today?  

I’m livid because he is in an in-patient rehab facility IN THE STATE NEXT TO THE ONE I GREW UP IN (despite never spending any prolonged time in my home country, ever… and it being two time-zones over from where he lived! Coincidence much??) and his therapist sent me an email ASKING IF I WANT TO TALK TO THE GUY THAT COULD HAVE KILLED ME. 


Her email is a joke.  She paints him like the victim in it.  With such classic lines as “[your abuser] is struggling a great deal.”  And “I have strongly urged him to engage in treatment as an opportunity to heal and hopefully provide an opportunity for your healing as well. He cares deeply for you and is expressing heavy shame around his behavior and alcoholism” 


Look lady, I frankly don’t give a flying fuck how much he’s struggling.  The guy wrapped his hands around my throat and I heard myself make those gagging noises, felt the blood pressure around my ears as the blood flow got cut off, and looked into the eyes of the man I once loved and thought to myself “this is it.  This is how I’m going to die.”  You think he’s struggling?  I’m devastated, my entire future is fucked up, and I’m picking up the pieces of a shattered life.  Oh and all I did was support the stupid asshole.  You want to show someone sympathy?  The attempted murderer in your midst is not the one who deserves it. 


She also tried to appeal to me. “I imagine you have concerns given his choice of treatment in [neighboring state]” (no shit sherlock, you don’t say). As well as “From what [your abuser] has shared with me you sound like a bright, charismatic and kind-hearted soul.” (oh fuck right off with trying to charm me, you cunt.) 


So I’ve reported her for ethics violation to the psychology board of her state, the APA, and her bosses.  This shit is beyond inappropriate.  


Has anyone else had their abuser’s therapist play conduit to contact you?

I live in the biggest city in my state and there are only a few dv houses, some of which onfl accep women with kids witch it great but I don’t have any. Of the ones I qualify for, all are full all the time. I called every day off and on for months (every day 1 week). They say u have to get there the same day someone leaves or you can’t have a spot. One lady told me to wait outside downtown for days and just be homeless until a spot opens. I have tried to prepare for being homeless aand on the streets downtown but I’m scared.

b63tms,He coerced me into not testifying.,"To begin, I’d like to say this is going to sound very “victimy”, and all I can say is, I’m aware of my own volition. I am aware that people such as my ex, seek out people just like me, because I am a perfect victim. And I’m working on that, not that it will matter now. 
I don’t know where to start. I became trauma bonded with a very manipulative and perhaps psychopathic/narcissistic monster of a person. He still has me bound via intentional intermittent reward cycling that seems to become more and more powerful vis-à-vis the trauma bond as time goes on. The first time he went to jail over events where in I was being injured and brutalized was October 2016. But he’d been Violent since January 2015, when I found out I was pregnant with our son. (Little did I know, little would it have mattered; that it is a common behavior of psychopaths and narcissists who leech off of others like parasites, -to get a women pregnant to trap them in a relationship. Anyway, after his first charges, wherein I was uncooperative and absent from investigation/prosecution proceedings , he came back to the house that we both lived in despite a number of factors including a legally implicit protection order that was in place through the end of his probation, as well as the fact that he was interloping from that point forward; I had previously paid his rent without question or complaint, but wasn’t going to make it quite so easy for him from that point forward. I did have a tentative plan that I kept only in my own head that if he could go one full month without being violent , aggressive (Gesturing, threatening, Purposefully frightening, chasing around the house), breaking things, screaming at our son etc., that I would appeal to the judge to amend the protection order. 
As you may be able to guess that never happened. Throughout the course of his interloping, he was building a fictional social media persona who had made some tough mistakes, none of which anyone knew details on, But that he was a changed man and that sobriety had brought him from the brink of losing his family who is so precious to him, to a place of higher understanding, enlightenment, healthier living, better parenting, etc. (!?!) Throughout the remainder of the domestic situation, he had been engaging in not very subtle smear campaigning against me, using his satellites as triangulation &amp; “appeal to authority” argumentative fallacy during our conflicts, (as if I didn’t know that they had been skillfully fooled into taking the opinion that they had *perhaps* taken, situation by situation.) ***There are tons of examples that I could bring up, I will summarize one; I made our family’s money &amp; Always had. Even prior to having a child, my ex was treated as a trophy boyfriend or something like that, never had to work or do anything for himself. Which I tolerated up to a point, and that point was likely right around when he knocked me up. So, as was the course of the entire relationship up to that point, my money took care of the family; and it became very tough for me to get Enough work in to feed the family and not go in to debt once he needed me to provide childcare (which he had always previously been available for in my absence) , because probation required him to work. But I knew he had to do what he had to do, and honestly it was nice to have him out of the house sometimes, I figured it may have been contributing to The relative decrease in violent outbursts on his part. It sure as hell seemed by that point that alcohol wasn’t the problem there, as His outbursts and violence was just as bad if not worse when sober, until he started working.  So I made it work, it was stressful, but at least my stress didn’t become everybody else’s punishment as his would have , (history had shown us while he was taking care of our baybay more and I was working more). And as can be expected with his personality type and entitled nature, his money was his money, God forbid I ask for him to Pitch in on Christmas presents for our baby or anything else, at all. At one point, Unbeknownst to me, until The last possible minute prior to the schedule change, he fought for more hours at work so as to appease his need for more music equipment and computer stuff, not to mention a couple of hopeless addictions that he had picked up in the absence of alcohol whilst on Court mandated UAs.  —And, while I can sympathize, our family can’t eat sympathy or music equipment. I didn’t stay quiet about that for any longer than one work week, and that was only so that I could have a leg to stand on once my earnings from my previous contract (which I completed the previous week) hit my bank account. I showed him, &amp; made gently but abundantly clear the difference between ourLevels of income/earnings per work done/hours invested.  Of course he dug his heels in, at least initially, as he would in every conflict wherein I was the one complaining. … His summarization of my issue During that conflict, Whilst venting to friends and family on the phone, -was that I “didn’t want him working”(!!!!)   ...Again there are more examples but I’d like to get on with the topic at hand eventually.***
So, let’s fast forward to October and November 2017; A lot had gone on,  where I would have 1 foot out the door, and suddenly he’d be making some grand gestures or promises that otherwise would have never occurred, or been uttered, as he was incapable of taking any sort of responsibility or admitting any sort of fault with his actions. I was dating somebody that I’ve known since high school, who I’d fallen in love with over the summer. I had sat down to tactfully and carefully break that news to the x (Mind you, we’d been broken up for Around two years at the time,  But he possessed me, in his valuation of things, whether I owned the relationship with my own validation or not); And, surprise surprise, he was sure to take over the conversation before I could get to the breaking of the bad news, and went in a direction with it that would in no uncertain terms threaten suicide in the event that I left him. So, I’m in a relationship that I can hardly get out of the house to upkeep, spend time, whatever; meanwhile at home things were becoming more and more tense as he would lock me in my room for hours on end so that I wouldn’t be able to get ready to go to My boyfriend's house. He resorted to drugging me, threatening to set my stuff on fire if I left, even threatening to neglect our baby and refusing to allow me to take him with me. All the while he would act so confounded, bewildered by my lack of affection or connection to him. That I wasn’t interested in watching The Walking Dead with him, or going for fun Sunday afternoons at the park. By that time I was so fed up that I didn’t even want to spend my birthday with him. That, by the way, created a big scene at the grocery store when I announced my intentions to hang out with a buddy who was in town on my birthday, And I basically had no choice but to call that off. In favor of, as it would play out, nursing a bunch of injuries caused by an extreme meltdown a A few days before my birthday. As well as another meltdown, just a few days after my birthday, which also caused severe injuries and scars and mental anguish and an exacerbation of a severe shoulder injury that he had caused when I was five months pregnant, etc. etc. etc.  All told, the month of November 2017, held four severe beatings for me, Nothing positive happened that month. Not as if I, at that point, believed much of what the ex would tell me as far as what I should hope for or future plans or promises, but I think a spark of hope was naïvely generated by his doting on the fact that it was my birthday, and that he had never had a job to be able to treat me for my birthday, Blah blah blah. He didn’t even buy me Band-Aids for my wounds .  The day of, I didn’t even get tacos for dinner, no less the cell phone that he’d owed me for three years, After smashing mine in a rage,  and talking so much talk About finally procuring in the weeks leading up to the madness that was that 2-week stretch. 
Moving on, a combination of child protective services and actions taken by my boyfriend, (calling the police to alert them to the breaking of the protection order that was consistently going on), Caused me to have to report the injuries And the occurrences that caused them. In hindsight I wish I had reported them accurately. Alas, I talked my father out of including in his report any details about the x having Strangled me, which he had done , with gusto,  in front of our child , no less. And I certainly left that detail out of mine. With Cps appeased and not feeling as if I was a danger To my son by way of allowing his father around us, or to get away with the things that he’d done to me. (CPS were made aware of the horrific goings-on, by way of a good friend of mine, Who I still don’t blame him for bringing the additional stress into my life right then, as it was done with the best of intentions.) The x was stuck having to find a place to live and pay rent for once, and I was stuck with medical bills, Extreme daily pain, emotional stress , and a 2 1/2-year-old. At a certain point I was attempting to convince the ex to pay for chiropractic care for me, as it was not an option in my budget, and he was suddenly getting a lot more hours at work, and seemed to have more than enough money to get whatever he wanted, not to mention his rent was a third what I paid for him alone where we lived. Anyway, I intimidated him to a breaking point and he just cut off all contact with me for about three months. Blocked my number on his phone, The whole nine. Then came Mother’s Day, he contacted me, and I thought it was sweet that he chose that day. The end of the day came and went, I paid for dinner, and didn’t hear ""happy Mother’s Day"", nor any type of apology that I was fecklessly awaiting. For whatever reason I let myself be Manipulated against my better judgment, into not testifying against him. I can’t tell you what a dumb move that was. In not testifying, I thereby gave up my time In front of his judge, when I would’ve been given the opportunity to request financial restitution for losses related to the charges. I haven’t heard from him since, not even after my best friend committed suicide. And he definitely would’ve heard about that through the grapevine. Oh, and here’s the kicker that I saved for an impactful last Paragraph: HIS MANIPULATIVE TACTIC THAT COMPELLED ME TO NOT TESTIFY; ...“ if all of those charges stick I’ll end up with my finances tied up in the courts indefinitely, as long as you don’t testify I’ll be able to pay you the 14 grand i owe you; ...if you promise you won’t testify, I’ll sign a promissory note for you before my court date.” 
And, as should have been expected, he put off setting up a time with me to draft said promissory and find a notary.  And here’s a pretty effed up secondary kicker: I have cancer, I was accepted into a research program that would include all travel and treatment related expenses including child care for while I was in treatment and recovery,  and he talked me out of going. Using his stress and being locked up not knowing where his family is , To pull my heartstrings, he all but guaranteed me Less than five years to complete my life’s work and hopefully hopefully Hopefully…make an impression on my son.",Fucksuffer,2019-03-27 05:23:13,3,2131,62.18,42.91,53.59,24.28,31.34,17.22,89.91,58.7,18.07,12.72,7.18,0.7,0.42,4.13,0.28,5.35,5.68,17.69,8.59,3.89,7.18,2.25,15.34,4.69,3.28,1.5,1.31,2.21,5.07,2.44,2.53,0.56,0.8,0.23,10.28,0.94,0.52,0.14,4.65,12.01,1.69,1.74,2.11,2.96,1.74,3.66,1.08,0.19,0.66,0.19,1.83,0.52,1.13,0.19,0.47,7.74,1.83,1.74,2.72,1.36,0.94,7.65,5.63,1.27,15.25,1.83,7.6,5.96,1.97,0.66,0.84,1.55,0.14,0.14,0.66,0.09,0,0,0.14,0.23,16.1,3.71,6.66,0.09,0.56,0.05,0.28,0.42,0.47,2.11,0.99,0.75
b65se3,I want to leave my abusive marriage but I worry about my daughter losing her grandparents in the process.,"My husband and I have been together for almost 8 years. About a year and after we started dating I found out I was pregnant. We were young he was 19 and I was 21. His parents immediately said that they would allow us to live with them but we had to get married (they are very religious) so we did.  
  
We lived there for the first 2 years of my daughters life. She is EXTREMELY close to his parents and even after we moved states away she still sees them multiple times a year and spends multiple weeks with them throughout the summer. Seeing them is really the highlight of her year. I honestly don't know what I would have done without them. They were a major support system more so than my own family at the time. They paid for her diapers and formula, got up with her in the middle of the night and watched her whenever we needed on top of letting us live with them for free. I spent a lot of time with them as well and I feel that we are pretty close.  
  
However, my marriage is and always has been toxic and abusive. They saw it when we lived there and they have honestly dealt with his anger issues long before I arrived. They may not be aware of the full extent of what he has done to me or their granddaughter but they have seen him destroy walls and break through bedroom doors, smash tv's, cell phones etc.  
  
I am concerned she could lose them. They are honestly her favorite people and I would never want to keep her from them but I don't know what to expect if I leave him. Will they be on his side? Help him with legal aid? Attempt to take her from me? They are pretty well off and I haven't really been perfect in our marriage either and idk if they will hold that against me. 

His sister was around for some of the more extreme cases of abuse and even begged me to come stay at their house but idk if she would still feel that way if her parents chose to protect him
  
Losing them is honestly one of the biggest reasons I have stayed and I don't really know what to expect when I leave. I don't know how custody with my husband would play out but as I get more info I don't know how safe it would be for him to get any because throughout our relationship he has beaten our dog and threatened to kill her, he has screamed in our daughters face accusing her of hiding his things, he has choked me on multiple occasions and he has hit me across the face (but only once), he has threatened my life while he was driving recklessly in the car, pulled out a loaded gun during an argument and threatened to kill himself, threatened to shoot up my work when I have tried to leave in the past and the more I truly analyze things I really need to keep him from her but I don't really have proof of any of these events and I have never called the cops on him and I worry he would take things out on her if I left.

   I went to court for a protection order for myself and son and my abuser did not show up. (Even though he has the best lawyer in the state...)
  My son and myself were granted the protection order for a year. I was so happy. I thought it all was over for at least a year. Wrong. 
   I looked online to find that he had filed a motion to modify the order and it was set for court in April. I freaked. I was quietly asking family and friend what to do for a week.
  Then I got a call from a blocked number saying they were a prosecutor in my county and said that I had court in April and if I didn’t want my order dropped I need to be there, then hung up on me.
  I have called the prosecutor on the case every single day for a month and she will not answer my messages. Lawyers will not take my case because they say it can’t be done and won’t bother looking into it for me. 
   All I want to know is if I need to be at that hearing and I for the life of me can not get answers. I’m so frustrated and I’m left with no one else to call.

b67q14,One more time.,"I keep thinking. Okay. That was the last time. I won't ever let him do this to me again. I think this angrily, in my head. I'm angry at him. I look like I'm sad and crying and hyperventilating, but I'm actually pissed. I don't express that outwardly though. I can't. Outward anger isn't really something I'm capable of.

And then I think about how I'll just get a bike. I fantasize about going to cash my tax refund check at Wal-Mart and just slipping away from him to the bike section, get rung up and sporting goods in the back and just ride out the tle door to freedom. It's sad that being a hobo with a bike is more appealing than where I'm at now.

I know i am losing it, because sometimes when he's screaming at me for hours i daydream about just tackling him to the floor and punching him in the face until he's gurgling and begging ME to stop for a change.

I want him to see that I am not the weak person who just takes it. But I always do. I am afraid to get hit again. I don't think that mentally I can take it. It's like, when he overtakes me and starts hitting me I freeze and I'm usually pinned down so there's not much I can do. I focus on de-escalating it. Once he starts screaming it's a 50/50 shot it's going to turn physical.

I also always think ""next time, I'm calling the cops."" But I never do. It was a lot less scary when we lived in an apartment, because the neighbors would hear through the wall and call. Now the neighbors are too far away to hear anything and the thought of trying to get to the phone while he is in a rage is absolutely terrifying. I would never make it. 

I'm new here and I'm so glad that I found this because I have no family or friends and I really just need to get some of this stuff out. The financial control is overwhelming and I don't usually even get a dollar to get a snack at work with. Even though I work full time.

I know I should be like ""your emotions are getting in the way, this isn't logical."" 
""You should be relieved that he's gonna be put away, and away from harming u and your family.""
But i don't feel anything like that.

Someone who was supposed to be a father to me was anything but. 

I feel bad for him because he's my father and I know he has issues that he struggles with, that makes him the way he is. 

And i know that those issues of his  aren't an excuse for how he abuses others. 

There were many times where he exploded in anger and it scared me, times when he didn't care that he was making me feel unsafe and hurt. 

All in all, i feel bad for my dad... but i know that there were times when he didn't feel bad for me.

b68x89,My ex has finally been served!,"Yesterday at 11:23am, I got a call on my house phone that my ex was served! The 28th is court. It would of been my 4th continued dated. I left with my daughter December 16th and immediately went to the local Women's Center to talk to an advocate. He sent 200+ texts, called every 2 minutes, emailed- the works. Three days of constant harassment. December 18th, I filed the injunction paperwork. The temp was granted in barely 2 hours with the amount of violent behavior that I wrote in it. I've since made an amendment to my DV injunction to include cyber stalking/stalking with 3 case numbers of him reporting various emails as scams to be deactivated, locking out my personal emails including my daughter's and her youtube account, and 10 Facebook accounts. Yes, I was stubborn to reconnect with my friends after the hell he put me through. He would make fake accounts to find my next newest one and then report it. Even sent me texts about how many I was gonna make and that I'm now ""allowed"" to have my old Facebook back if I'd talk to him. Yeah, didn't happen but just gave me more evidence of his delusional mindset. Even has used my old Facebook to try and get my friends to give him information on my daughter and I and where we were staying, etc. 

He has managed to dodge the process serves until yesterday. Irony though, second case number of his cyberstalking, the first responding officer is actually the one who served him! He remembered reading my petition and became so angry. Every officer has that I've encountered and let know what has happened had the same expression of anger and tells me how strong of a mom I am. I don't feel that way, I just wanted him served so I can finally get on with my life for my munchkin. Now that it has been, I'm freaking out. Under 72 hours is the court date and I'm a ball of nerves. Keep replaying the voicemail and it still doesn't feel real. Very much hoping he doesn't show tomorrow. I don't want to tell a room full of people how he's broken me physically and mentally or that I'm struggling with feelings of self-harm from it. My munchkin is the only reason I won't. And I keep replaying my boyfriend reading over the questions that I'm going to be asked, grabbing me and crying. ""I'm so sorry he did those things to you."" Well, really all of it is replaying in fast forward. My anxiety is through the roof and just want to run away from it all. 

But I am winning! I made his promises of us not leaving the relationship alive into dust. Just words and echos of a goddamn monster. Next will be claims court to make him pay back damages of my car, doctors and hospital bills, and dentist appointments. He will pay. I am so far, his third victim but I damn sure intend on being his last. Fuck him and the noise he rode in on. He'll rot a sad pathetic worm.",gl0w-w0rmxi,2019-03-27 12:58:31,6,535,38.48,42.58,53.3,2.55,14.08,17.76,87.66,54.39,18.69,14.95,10.09,0.37,0.19,4.3,0,3.74,4.86,12.34,9.72,5.61,6.92,1.31,19.07,3.74,1.12,1.12,2.43,1.68,5.05,1.12,3.74,0.37,1.68,0.75,11.78,0.75,0.75,1.12,4.49,8.79,2.06,2.43,1.31,1.12,1.12,1.87,1.5,0.19,0.56,0.75,1.68,0.19,1.12,0.19,0.19,5.05,1.68,0.75,2.24,0.75,0,5.98,11.03,1.68,13.08,2.62,5.23,6.36,1.68,1.12,0.37,1.12,0.19,0.19,2.06,0.93,0.19,0.37,0.19,0,15.7,6.36,3.36,0.19,0,0,0.75,0.37,0.75,3.55,0,0.37
b696f0,My dad is a domestic violence victim and doesnt want to leave.,"So, this is my first post here.  And this is a long one, bear with me.  


I am the daughter of a great dude, my dad has always been the rock of my life, but the past few years have been especially hard on him.   


After a turbulent (REALLY turbulent) final divorce with my mother, a move to another city (he is a real family man, and now lives about 120km away from any family, me and my brother got stuck on the old town due to our studies), new job and everything. After mom made our lives living hell for about a year after the divorce things finally settled down a bit.   


Dad started a romance with a young woman from his job, she a lot younger than him (12 years) and a bit vain, but, as a family we just accepted her since it was my dads choice.  


Dad seemed happy at the start and me and my brother were happy for him, life had been hard but it looked like he found someone to make it a bit easier.  


But, as all good things come to an end, so did her facade. She started little by little, she is very jealous and possessive of him, and started berating him with insults every time she THOUGHT he was even in the same place as another woman.

&amp;#x200B;

He complained a bit about it to me but said she just needed to work things out. 

&amp;#x200B;

They have been together on and off for about 2 years at this point, and things have gotten worse and worse. She escalated from being a bit jealous, to screaming at his face ate home, at work, destroying his property, destroying his authority at work, screaming profanities and trying her best to make him feel like shit, also escalating things to physical violence (she has made him bleed multiple times by now).  


I have tried my best to convince him to leave her, but that woman is like a drug to him, he always says he wants to leave, they break up, he says hes relieved, and just a few days maybe a week later they are together again with her promising she is going to change.

&amp;#x200B;

Things got so bad she just doesn't bother hiding her ugly side anymore in front of us (in front of no one to be more exact) she will scream at his face and has swung at him more than once when we are visiting. 

&amp;#x200B;

As we are a non confrontational family with this kind of shit, i have talked a lot directly to my dad but never to her, as that is a boundary very big to us. But i get more and more worried as time goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't handle it anymore and confronted her at one point, dad got a little pissed but i talked with him and he understood. Since then I haven't been to his house and he always finds some excuse to not come to mine.

I am worried she will be the end of my father and don't know what else to do but to call the police (but in my country..... that would just mean bad news for him).

&amp;#x200B;

As people who have survived domestic violence, and are close to people that did what do you think I should do? I really see no option, he wont leave her, she controls and destroys him. I just don't know.",DnDisfunguys,2019-03-27 13:18:58,13,601,46.15,79.72,21.7,1.66,25.04,10.82,94.84,58.74,19.63,14.98,4.66,1.16,0.17,8.49,0.5,4.66,5.49,14.81,8.65,4.66,7.82,1.83,17.3,6.82,4.49,0.67,1.16,3.33,6.66,1.83,4.83,0.33,2.33,0,17.14,3.16,0.17,4.49,6.82,10.65,2.16,1.33,1,1.66,1.66,3,1.83,0.33,1,0.5,2.33,1,1.33,0,0.17,7.82,2.66,1.66,2,1.5,0.83,5.66,10.82,1.16,15.97,2,6.66,6.99,1.16,0.83,1.33,0,0.17,0,0.83,0.67,0,0,0,0,17.14,4.49,5.66,0,2,0.17,0,0,0,0.83,2,2
b6a6fq,Anxiety or fear at the dentist/doctor,"Recently out of a 20 year marriage to an abusive man, I am hesitant to go to a dentist because laying back in a chair with someone hovering over me and I am not able to communicate with the tools they are using will give me a flashback for sure.

One idea I came up with is to hold something in my hand that I can drop to let the dentist or hygienist know that I need a break because I am getting anxious or fearful.

It is a non verbal way of communicating that I am feeling unsettled and need a minute.

Maybe there are others who need to communicate that you need to stop whatever procedure is happening without using your voice - especially a freeze type like me.

Hope it helps!",rm-rfstar,2019-03-27 14:38:58,14,140,75.19,36.03,62.17,1.91,23.33,20,92.14,59.29,17.86,10,7.86,0,1.43,0,0.71,7.86,8.57,15.71,8.57,2.86,5,1.43,19.29,1.43,1.43,1.43,1.43,0,7.14,2.14,5,4.29,0.71,0,8.57,0.71,0,0,0.71,17.86,2.14,2.86,3.57,6.43,1.43,4.29,2.86,0,0.71,2.14,3.57,0.71,2.86,0,0,8.57,3.57,0.71,2.14,0.71,1.43,0.71,13.57,1.43,12.14,2.14,5.71,4.29,0.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.71,2.86,0.71,0,0,0,0.71,0.71,0,0,0,0.71
b6bzqo,Feeling drained,"I'm (21F) in the last few weeks of university and it just feels like everything is going downhill. For months my boyfriend (22M) was emotionally abusive towards me with a few incidents of physical abuse which I get vivid flashbacks of pretty often. Today I was watching a tv show that I hadn't watched in a while and I just started hyperventilating and crying because it was on during one of the times he hit me because the show triggered him .

I've talked to my boyfriend about this and he acknowledges he was wrong for the things he did but I still feel like he tries to justify it a little. I've signed myself up for counselling but everything is starting to affect my ability to concentrate and I feel confused a lot. A part of me still believes there's good in him and that we can work through it but a part of me just wants everyone to know what I did and run away from him. I just feel so lost and drained. I hate him but I love him at the same time. I feel embarrassed this happened to me and feel like i failed my parents by not picking a better person. I've never felt so much anger and pain before I grew up never seeing my parents argue so this was all too much for me.",SchunGGles,2019-03-27 17:18:12,1,233,34.29,28.84,90.18,1,21.18,15.88,96.57,62.66,23.61,17.17,12.45,0.43,0,4.29,0,6.44,5.58,15.02,6.87,6.44,8.58,1.72,18.88,3,2.58,0.86,0.43,3.43,6.87,1.72,5.15,0.86,2.15,1.29,10.3,0.86,0.86,0,5.15,14.59,5.58,2.58,0.43,1.72,2.58,2.15,6.44,2.58,0,3.86,1.29,0,0.86,0,0,7.3,2.58,2.58,1.29,1.29,0.86,6.44,9.87,0.86,13.3,1.29,4.72,7.3,1.72,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.58,4.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.58,1.72,0

b6fy1f,Victim impact statement.,"Hello, , please forgive me if I am not in the right sub. I am Canadian, I am a (34) female. I was in a relationship with a (34) male for four months. It did not end well, and he ended up holding me in his house for a day, beating me, threatening me, destroying some of my belongings. 

Thanks to my best Friend I went to the police, and he received i believe around 7 charges. Some being unlawful confinement , uttering threat, breach of an undertaking, assault with a weapon. 

Last month I had to go testify in court, it was one of the hardest days of my life. He thought I was not going to show up to court , and that they would throw out all the charges. 

He ended up getting found guilty on all the charges except one. The crown prosecutor has called me and asked me if I would be willing to read a victims impact statement at his sentencing trial. 

Sorry for the long winded post. But I am wondering, has anyone done this ? Do you think it makes a difference when the judge is making his derision on the sentencing ? If any one has any experience with this please let me know.

b6vwnv,Help please.,"So I've been with him for years and years. I never once cheated until a year ago. My job was bad everything was bad. He was hitting me a lot and screaming and yelling and he didn't have a job and just drank all day so I was totally miserable. I tried to break up with him before I cheated but that was a literal nightmare that I never want to experience again. The other guy was really loving and made me feel good. Don't worry my abuser scared him away. 

Anyways. My boyfriend is still super abusive. He acts like he's done so much to change because after not having a job for 2 years he finally got one at a fast food restaurant. And he did court ordered batterers intervention and got some anger management therapy on his own. He can't pass a background check because he has aggravated assault charge from hitting me.

Last night he was having an argument. I can't say ""we"" were having an argument because usually it's just him screaming at me and putting me down and getting more and more animated until I'm having a panic attack because I'm afraid he is going to hit me.

He feels like me cheating is so much worse than the physical abuse. He said ""yeah so I slap you a few times"" (this is minimizing he has done a lot more than just slap me. One time he called 911 on himself because he was drunk and thought he killed me).

He doesn't drink anymore but he is actually more violent and rude now that he doesn't. 

So, am I wrong? Is everything he's done okay because I cheated? Does it not matter that I am a shell of the person I used to be. Because of him? I mean, he screams at me so much about me cheating and how it's so much worse than his abuse. He makes fun of me because the things he says hurt my feelings.

I said I didn't feel like he loved me or why could he do that to me? He screamed that that was an effing joke and that of course he loves me. Look at everything he did for me 10 years ago. (None of which happens now)

I just need to know if I am totally crazy for thinking him physically abusing is as bad as me cheating on him?",Throwawayu6716547,2019-03-29 04:06:49,2,408,7.44,40.32,18.79,1,14.07,14.95,94.85,63.73,24.26,19.61,9.8,0.25,0.25,9.31,0,4.66,4.41,10.29,12.01,6.86,9.8,2.94,19.12,5.88,3.92,0.74,1.47,3.43,11.76,2.21,9.56,1.23,5.15,0.49,13.97,0,0.49,0,9.8,13.24,1.96,3.68,0.98,1.47,1.96,3.92,3.92,0.25,2.21,1.23,2.45,0,0.74,0,1.23,7.11,1.47,1.96,1.47,0.98,1.47,7.11,11.52,0.25,10.29,1.23,2.45,6.62,1.23,1.23,0,0,0,0.25,0.98,0.25,0,0.49,0,0.25,12.99,5.88,0.49,0,0,1.23,0,0,0.98,3.43,0.98,0
b6whxm,Is this domestic abuse ?,"So this has been happening for awhile now and I have literally no one to turn to about it. Which is so frustrating as I don’t know where to put myself. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years and 2 months now. And we’ve lived together for the majority of that time. But things have kept happening to question if he actually loves me.

He has aspergers, so he sees the world in a different way to what I do. It’s not an extreme case. To be fair you wouldn’t even realise he had it. But I don’t know if it’s that or something else causing what happens. When we argue he can get quite up a height. To the point where everything in his path will be destroyed. Punching walls, doors. Throwing things etc etc.

There have been a few occasions when he has done things to hurt me. He’s thrown a fan at me. He’s pushed me so hard to the point where I’ve went flying into the floor and onto my back. ( I have mental rods and screws in my back from serious spinal surgery I had a few years back). I’ve been shoved called all the names under the sun. He’s rattled me about to try and get me out of the way to leave when I’ve wanted to sit and talk calmly about things. And last night he even went as far as to put me in a headlock. I couldn’t breath.. I’m not sure if he meant to do it to the point where I couldn’t breathe. But I really don’t know anymore.

Last night I told him I don’t think I could forgive him this time and that I thought it needed to end. After a few hours of talking he said “I didn’t think you actually meant it when you said you were going to leave”. But in no way did I give across the idea that I was going to stay.

I just feel a little as though he thinks he can do what he wants to me and with the way he treats me as he knows I’ll just forgive him. And I never get a great apology either it’s always just “I’m sorry it won’t happen again” and he tries to make myself seem really sad about what he’s done. Which makes me feel like he’s trying to make me feel sorry for him.

Is this abuse ? As this is my first proper relationship. I’ve dated before but not like this. I love him so much and really want things to work out but I don’t want things to get worse either.

I won’t talk about it because it’s not necessary, but I’m having sleep anxiety. Basically, I’m anxious about falling asleep because I keep having nightmares. They range anywhere from being raped to just waking up in my bed and my ex is there. They’re always incredibly realistic and I’m nervous to fall asleep. I went to the doctor and they gave me some trazodone to help, but I still had the dreams. They don’t happen every night, but it’s enough to make me not want to sleep. I’m averaging 3-5 hours a night. I didn’t know if anyone had any advice about dealing with it. I work out, I have aromatherapy, taken meds. Nothing is helping and I’m really tired.

b78h1h,New Episodes,"I’ve seen this show before. I know how the story plays out like it’s etched into me. I could recite the main characters life story from memory. I know his thoughts, his fears, his sorrow, his scars. Horror always has been a favorite of mine, but this one terrifies me. 

It’s honestly really impressive how much the main character cares, how much he does for everyone around him to keep them safe, but it’s even more impressive how he hides the pain and the guilt from all of them. He can’t stand the thought of giving them their own pain, fear, sorrow, or scars - they don’t deserve that... nobody does. So he puts himself in the way to protect them - he shields them from the horrors that exist.

The story starts like so many others, two lovers who are thrown into a world they don’t know, but together they know they can navigate this place together. As long as they have each other, what could go wrong? A tale as old as time. 

The show has its dull moments, sure, the usual “filler” episodes we all get bored with, but it gets especially scary when the storm starts to spread. It is consuming, at times. Relentless. Haunting. Now, the darkness of the storm is always there. There is no way to destroy it, but it can be contained. Our main character fights as hard as he can to keep the darkness contained, to keep it away from everyone and everything he holds dear, he can hide it from them all. 

When the darkness spreads into a storm he is on his own, fighting to survive from the true horrors it brings. His lover is nowhere to be found, she is sucked into the center of the storm and although there’s a way out, it takes hold and she can’t seem to find the courage to fight it off. 

It always starts the same way - the voices in the wind whispering to him, telling him that he doesn’t want to help his lover, he wants to let the darkness consume her. He tries to ignore the whispering, he knows those old familiar manipulations and lies. The whisper gets louder and louder, never ending, never taking a break, until he can’t drown them out anymore. He can’t even hear himself think, he feels forced to respond out of fear of losing his grip on sanity. It’s useless though, he’s drowned out, it keeps tearing at him and tearing at him while he’s fighting for air, screaming at the top of his lungs that they’re wrong - that he would go to the end of the earth to save her, but the voices continue to grow, louder, scarier, meaner. 

It turns from manipulation, lies, and drowning him out into attacks. The psychological warfare is the storm’s perfect defense, it protects the center and prevents anything from getting near it, but once the offensive game starts, there is nowhere to hide and nowhere to run to. The voices will beat him down, rip him to shreds, destroy his hope and his sanity, make him question is very existence and morality. He tries as hard as he can to push forward into the storm of darkness, hoping his heart will guide him to victory - love can, and will, conquer all! It has to! 

In some episodes he submits, let’s the voices win, let’s the storm take hold - he knows it will eventually fade and he’ll be able to reach his lover again, even if it’s temporary. There are other episodes where he foolishly thinks his heart can prevail and that he can beat the darkness - he sees an opening and he takes it, one that he thinks is the path to him and his lover both finding safety. 

The storm won’t go down that easily - it erupts. Buildings and homes around him begin to break apart, cars and stones are being hurled left and right, some directly at him - he’s dodging them as best he can, but the storm only gets stronger. The winds are howling, pushing him over, into walls, down the stairs, he can’t keep his footing. The winds continue to swell, they are now lashing at him with all of the power it can find - pushing and pulling him in all directions, whipping him, slicing right through him. He knows there’s no escape. He’s eventually so drained from trying to survive from the storm that he runs, as far as he can, where all he can do is pick himself up, bruised and bloodied, and try to find safety anywhere he can. 

Again, the storm will fade and he will find his lover at the center and even though it is fleeting, that time with her before the storm picks back up always leaves him with hope that they can fight it off for good. Together. They can make such a great team, they’ve won so many other battles with monsters and creatures that they thought would surely be the end of them. He knows they have to win this one too. Does she? 


I wish so badly I could just tell him that his lover is the darkness, that she is the storm... I don’t think he would listen though... he already knows the truth, deep down, but he tries as hard as he can to hold onto that faith they can defeat it together, even if the storm defeats him a thousand times. Love can conquer all, right? It might, but how much of himself does he have to give to find out if love can win? How badly must he be hurt by the voices or the winds before he either sees his own downfall or before he gives up... 

The show has almost gotten too scary, too dangerous. Even though she’s painted as a hero who has been taken over by the darkness of the storm, I always think that maybe she always was a storm... maybe she can’t be anything else... and maybe she doesn’t want to. 

I’ll keep watching for now, I always root for a happy ending, but I’m beginning to think this story was never meant to end that way... one can always hope, but should they?

My friend ShyGirl will be SG

DouchebagBoyfriend will be DB

Another friend BirthdayGirl will be BG

&amp; Me

\*\*\*This Post doesn't have a happy ending\*\*\*  


Before I write this post I have to say, while there are some great people on Reddit, there are also some major #ssholes on this site. Calling bullshit on posts they don't agree with just because they don't like the narrative or the brutal honesty of them. Its pathetic as I take pride in including every minor detail in my posts &amp; YES! They are 100% true. That being said this didn't happen to me directly but to a female friend I had known a few years.

&amp;#x200B;

She was a shy yet beautiful, curvy girl at 22 she was the youngest of our group of friends, kind of an introvert but was funny &amp; kind when you got to know her. We were all out with friends when some random, average looking loudmouth guy (DB) came over &amp; invited himself into our group (He turned out to be 43) &amp; took special interest in SG who surprising to the rest of us was quite taken with this tools advances. As the night went on we made an effort to include this interloper as SG seemed to like the DB at the end of the night we were getting a taxi back &amp; he was all over SG even asked if he was going back to her place or his? To his chagrin she said neither as they had just met that night, Seeming pissed he shook it off and smiled asking for her number. This was the beginning of the end of our friendship with her.

&amp;#x200B;

On the occasions that we actually saw her, she would have her phone in her hand, as this loser messaged her before she could even reply to his previous message. he ended up coming out on another friends birthday (Uninvited) she seemed to have a bruise on her arm. we asked throughout the night. DB would answer for her &amp; would get a little angry if a female friend would ask her about it. She went to the bar for a drink &amp; went over to ask if anything was wrong &amp; she gave a forced smile &amp; said yes I turn to her &amp; give her a hug (purposely looking at DB) He looked PISSED, but as with every abuser they don't have the balls to do a damned thing about it. Anyway he got up around half an hour after I had the audacity to hug SG looking down at SG expectedly she grabs her bag &amp; looking down got up to leave. her friend (who's birthday it was) grabs her arm &amp; asks ""where are you going?"" DB literally slaps her arm away. I have had a few drinks at this point so didn't react right away &amp; said ""What the fuck dude?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

He actually took her arm forcing her toward him when BG shouts ""Hey, dickbead wtf are you playing at?"" His fist clenching &amp; furious look in his eyes as a doorman made his way over DB quickly let go of SG's arm &amp; he backs away as he sees the huge doorman making his way to him. DB was defeated tonight anyway as SG was best friends with BG as he glared at SG she shrank back a little as BG gave him a ""Go fuck yourself look"" he slithered off begrudgingly &amp; minutes later he immediately messaged SG. (I didn't see the message but according to BG it was disturbing) As we expected she made excuses &amp; left soon after.

&amp;#x200B;

This was one of the last times we would see her, well me anyway as BG stayed in touch with SG longer than I as BG had her new number but DB wouldn't let any guys have her number, he'd also made her delete her Facebook &amp; any other social media accounts. Over the coming months I didn't see her but BG would keep me informed of her being now massively overweight &amp; had actually broke down telling her that he made her eat food she didn't like it because he didn't like guys looking at her, EVERY time BG would see her SG would constantly be replying to texts from DB. 

&amp;#x200B;

3 years on I am posting this is because SG who was always so fun and healthy is now basically a shut in with diabetes &amp; still living with DB I know sucks that it ended like this &amp; that he has basically broken her to his will. I am tempted to post a picture of the night out but won't out of respect to all involved.

b7i4ev,Abuse Escalating,"My husband never yelled at me, let alone was physically violent prior to marriage.  After the birth of our son he punched me in the arm because I needed to be driven across town to get the prescriptions needed for my diagnosis of the flu + pneumonia and the baby was colicky.  He broke a remote, threw toys, punched walls, etc for months but hadn’t touched me.  We briefly attended counseling and things wee moderately better as long as I gave into his sexual demands (sex less than once a day left him angry, feeling unwanted, and “unsatisfied.”) 

At the beginning on March he threw a remote at me leaving a large bruise and threatened to strangle me if I didn’t go upstairs.  He apologized and things were fine except the ongoing verbal abuse until our toddler started crying at  10pm on Thursday night. He shoved/hit me out the bed. Charged me twice, including picking up his belt threatening to beat me half to death for supposedly waking up the baby.  He’s refused up apologize and stated his only mistake was marrying me.  I recorded most of the incident on Thursday night.

I’m afraid to go to the police because he will hurt me if I turn him in.  I don’t even know if what I have is enough evidence to secure a criminal conviction.  I’m terrified and trying to find excuses to run errands alone and be in a different room of the house, but I don’t know what will set him off next..,",Throwaway98764310987,2019-03-30 17:50:21,14,257,76.37,40.78,86.53,1,18.36,19.84,90.66,53.31,16.34,14.79,8.56,1.17,0,5.06,0,1.56,7,16.34,7,1.95,7,1.95,16.34,7,3.11,0.78,1.17,0.78,7,1.17,5.84,1.56,2.72,1.95,10.51,1.95,0,0,5.84,10.12,2.33,1.17,2.72,2.33,0.39,3.5,1.56,0,0.39,1.17,2.72,0.39,1.56,0.78,0,9.34,1.95,1.56,5.45,0.78,1.56,7,6.61,0.78,21.01,4.28,10.12,6.61,1.17,0.39,1.17,0,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.01,5.45,3.5,0,0,0,0,0,0.78,2.72,0.78,0.78
b7i6yg,Should I got look for the guy who assaulted me ?,"I am a single 42 yr. old female and I was sexually assaulted by a 23 yr. old male.

Me: 5'2 106lbs   Him: 6'1 180 - 190 lbs

The night of the assault he picked up a pillow and just started beating me with then dialed '911' to try to scare me. I think he was trying to call ICE because I said I was a greencard holder waiting to become a US citizen.

He also infected me in the rectum with HPV virus as a result of that night.

I found out last month the judge decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. The detective told me he never answered his phone and he even went to his house to look for him and nobody was there.

He is getting away with felony sexual assault because he refused to talk to the detective.

Should I let it go ? ( I already tried to press charges on him by applying for probable cause affidavit and it was not approved by the judge ) or should I try to hunt him down and deliver him to the police myself ?

b7ios7,"I have an under aged, mentally unstable family member and nobody seems to care.","Sorry for the long post. I just needed to rant about this to somebody:

I like to see my home as a safe, stress-free haven (for the most part). Somewhere to get away from all the idiots at work and the occasionally intense college environment. But unfortunately, that's too much to ask for.

I currently live with my mother and younger 17 year old brother. The latter over the past few years, has proven to to be an unstable piece of shit. He's spoiled. He have anger issues. He steals money to buy cigarettes. He sits at home all day because he got kicked out of school. And he just does dumb shit for the sake of doing dumb shit (Like arguing with people over social media and giving them our address so he can fight them).

Eventually it gets so bad that he starts breaking things in the house and, on multiple occasions, have assaulted somebody during one of these meltdowns (including our mother) over very little things. These episodes go down the same way:

\- He starts breaking shit

\- The police gets called

\- They talk to him and leave (Sometimes repeat these first three processes another two more times)

\- He gets physical with someone

\- We put him down until the police arrives

\- He gets taken away and could be gone anywhere between a few days to a couple of months.

This is a cycle that I've been dealing with for the past 3 years now. He's suppose to be on some kind of medication but he always ends up not taking it and going down this path. I work and go to school, so I'm usually too busy to moderate him on a regular basis, but I would expect my mother to make sure he takes his medicine. After the recent incident, I can safely assume that she DOES NOT and just takes his word for it whenever she asks him. I say this because I had to go through this AGAIN just a few days ago and I found the medicine that he was suppose to take stashed away somewhere on his computer desk.

I've been meaning to move out for a while. Part of the thing that's stopping me is that I'm afraid to leave my mom alone with him. And it's clear that he's taking a toll on her emotionally. I've tried sitting down and talking this with her about this multiple times about how uncomfortable I feel about her being alone with him. How dangerous he is to have around whether it's him directly or indirectly. But she doesn't take this seriously at all. Despite how many times we go through this, no matter how irritated he makes her whenever he meltsdown and make threats to her, she invites him right back like everything is fine until he does it again. And it just repeats. And she just dismisses (or, at least, refuses to give me any clear response) when I try to explain to her how unhealthy this is and suggest that maybe we should find some alternative for dealing with him. Like putting him in a group home or something.

Speaking of ""recent incident""; I got into a nasty confrontation with him that resulted in multiple scars from rolling on the pavement and bite marks on my arm. That day (a few days ago) after I had to beat and restrained him and he got taken away (for the umpteenth time), not only did he make sure to attack multiple officers in the process but he also made repeated threats on my life. A day later he had a trial and was allowed to COME BACK HOME THAT DAY. As usual, my mom is acting like everything is just fine and he already seems to be showing signs that he's slipping again.

I can take this anymore and it seems like nobody else is even trying to take this seriously. Not my mom. Not the system. Nobody.

It's crazy that somebody with a history of trouble like this can get so many slaps on the risk. The law can't be THAT lenient on minors, right? Especially repeat offenders. Right?

Fuck it. I can't take it anymore. Can't live here. It's too stressful. I've been complaining about this with a few friends for a long while now and one of them even offered me to room up with them. I'm moving out in a few months. I REALLY don't want to leave my mom alone with him, but I don't feel comfortable living with him and how can I help someone who won't let me help them or give my suggestions any thought? This is one of those situations where nobody cares UNTIL AFTER something really bad happens. The blatant red flags being raised here are all too common and, like I said, nobody seems to be taking it seriously at all.

b7jpw0,Advice please,"So my husband gets mad at me a lot and will emotionally abuse me which I'm used to due to living with my grandfather after my parents died. My husband was physical a few times but nothing major that would set off alarms in a 16 year olds head.
 When I turned 18 and moved in I noticed he got really controlling. I couldn't spend time with my best friend anymore because best friend was male. Then when I graduated I started applying for jobs but kept getting turned down. He would come home and yell at me because the basement (area we were living in) wasn't clean even though it was all his stuff.
 I finally landed a job at a warehouse and was working 10 hours straight. Longer than him. I met some nice people and even made a friend, but this friend was male. Male friend offered me a ride home when my husband was an hour late and it being cold I said yes. I told my husband who flipped out. I asked for help from roommates but they stayed out of it, I don't blame them because my husband is 6'2"" so he's pretty scary even to other men. Later that night I defend myself and he snaps he beats the shit out of me.
 Fast forward a few months he does it again because I told him I wanted to see a consular. The cycle repeats but I never show any signs of abuse so I can't call the cops. Fast forward to tonight. My hand slipped and accidentally hit his mouth (we were playing around and I was on top of him) he then hits me in the nose so hard it bleeds. I don't know what to do.

b7jva0,I can finally listen to music again!,"It’s been over 1 1/2 years since I left my abuser. One of our things was music. We shared music, staying up all night, dancing. Taking turns showing each other bands that we loved. After he sent me to the hospital, I knew I couldn’t go back. He’d kill me if he got the chance. 

After I left I couldn’t listen to music. I started listening to stand-up comedians. It felt better to be distracted and laugh, then to feel that drowning feeling, where you’re on the edge of a black hole that will swallow you, given the chance. 

Now, I can drive my car, and listen to music again. The black hole isn’t going to take me, I even sing along!

b7lenr,I finally did it,"Hi all 

This is my first post and I thought I could share something that would help some people out by letting them know that this happens to people. I’m a male and I finally made it out of a two year abusive relationship with my bipolar girlfriend. 

A few months after dating she began to have episodes of screaming at me or being silent and insulting everything about me. I was 16 at the time and couldn’t understand why she was doing it but I thought it was normal and I didn’t tell anyone. A month or two down the road she began going through my phone and computer looking at my messages to see chat transcripts of me and a close female friend. That’s when she started hitting me. She strangled, punched, threw things and bit me. I’m a tall guy who competes in MMA but no matter what she did I couldn’t bring myself to stop her or defend myself. I just let it happen to me. For a year she hit me and verbally abused me for having a female friend while degrading me at every chance she took including in front of other people. 

The reason I stayed with her for two years is because when she wasn’t abusive she was neutral and I thought that was love. She made me think so little of myself that I truly believed that her not abusing me was showing affection. She eventually made me cut off contact with my friend and I haven’t talked spoken to her since which is a huge regret of mine.

She ended up cheating on me and after reaching out and asking for help I was able to cut off all ties with her. I want to make sure that young men with abusive girlfriends understand that something is wrong and they need to reach out for help no matter how hard it is.",NagsUkulele,2019-03-31 01:07:30,4,326,25.75,45.13,75.57,2.14,20.38,14.42,95.71,62.27,25.77,18.1,11.96,0,0,5.52,0.61,7.67,3.68,14.42,8.9,3.37,7.67,2.45,19.02,3.07,0.61,2.15,1.53,1.84,5.83,1.53,4.29,0,2.15,0.31,16.26,0,2.15,6.13,0.92,13.8,2.76,2.76,2.15,2.45,1.84,3.07,2.45,0.92,1.23,0.31,0.61,0,0.31,0,0,8.28,4.6,1.23,2.45,0.31,0.92,7.36,7.06,0.61,15.03,1.23,6.75,7.06,0.92,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.67,4.6,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.45,0,0
b7mnnv,Why do I feel no anger toward my former abuser after he tried to strangle me?,"Hello, so I’m really new to this sub so bear with me. On Thursday night, my boyfriend was very drunk and choked me during an argument. He didn’t let go of me until I went limp and was screaming at me that it was my fault for not leaving the issue at hand until the morning when he wasn’t still drunk. We had been together for three years. He had never done anything like that, except for one time under about two years back, he shoved me to the ground repeatedly until I had to call the cops. Still, our day to day relationship was happy, and I absolutely saw a future with him. I went to the ER the next day, this time, to make sure I was okay and did an examination that also acted to file a report. I’m honestly having a hard time processing it, and when explaining all of this to him she pointed out that I feel no anger toward him at all. I texted him saying that I do not want to see him again, and that I hope he seeks professional help immediately. But still, I just feel absolutely nothing toward him emotionally right now. When I told my parents, they were immediately angry and wanted me to press charges, but I have a hard time even thinking about doing that for some reason. I just don’t know what to do to facilitate my emotional processing of it all.

b7o55o,"Asking about a friend who lives in the Florida panhandle and what they can do to protect their self (legal wise) from their estranged abusive parents who is trying everything in their power to bring them back to DFW, TX to where they currently live.","Before anyone assumes anything, my friend is a 22 year old adult who is currently crashing at their ex boyfriend’s mother’s house. Their parents had been super abusive to them all throughout the years and my friend finally had the chance to flee away from them over the summer. My friend who is a black non binary queer person has suffered homophobic and transphobic abuse from their parents. Like not just insults and taunts, but even physical abuse as well. My friend doesn’t want anything to do with their family and they feel safe around them. 

Anyways long story short, my friend’s family has been looking for them FOR MONTHS! Trying every tactic they can from emails to texts and even creating catfish accounts on social media to try to reach out to them and get them to come back home. My friend even told me their parents would try to get a court ordered warrant to get them to come back with them and their parents would try to use their mental illness as an excuse. Threatening to send them to a psych ward or something. My friend is indeed scared out of their mind and they feel like they don’t have no legal rights to protect themself from the ppl who had created them.  Just because they are their parents don’t mean shit, right? My friend’s father showed up to their current home in Florida yesterday evening and luckily my friend’s ex’s mom was there to protect them. But my friend’s ex’s mom threatened to bring her gun out if he comes around again. I don’t know if their dad can potentially use that against them or whatever. How my friend’s dad found out their whereabouts is cuz their ex boyfriend tipped off their little sister when the ex was mad at them. Like ugh. What a fucking bitch. But anyways, I wanna know what can my friend do to legally protect their self in Florida from all of this? 

I’m all the way in North Carolina living with my mom currently and I don’t have a lot of money nor resources, but I will try to talk to my mom today and see if my friend can come stay with us here in North Carolina. Cuz it isn’t safe for them to be in Florida and I really care about this person and I want them to be okay.",oldraykissedbae,2019-03-31 07:10:13,0,447,45.33,86.35,45.73,13.62,21.29,15.44,91.5,58.39,19.24,15.21,5.15,0.22,0,0.45,9.4,4.03,3.36,16.33,8.72,5.37,6.94,2.01,16.33,2.91,1.34,2.68,0.22,1.12,5.37,2.24,3.13,0.67,2.46,0.22,21.7,3.8,2.46,1.57,1.34,12.3,1.79,1.79,1.79,4.47,1.34,3.13,1.34,0.89,0,0.45,1.79,0.22,1.12,0.45,0,10.74,4.92,2.24,1.34,0.67,2.01,2.91,13.87,0.67,12.53,2.01,7.16,4.25,1.12,0.45,1.12,0.45,0,0,3.58,0.67,0.67,0.45,0.45,0.45,10.29,4.03,1.57,0,0,0.45,0.22,0,0,3.58,0.45,0

b7zzse,Since I was 7 my mum beated me for anything.,"(English is not my mother language, forgive me for any mistake)

Hi , during my childhood my mum used to beat me , often with some stuff (Books , etc.) . 

I’m really shy so I have a few friends and during my 3 years in the middle school I got bullied several times by my classmate and often even by some of my teachers and for evading this I started playing video games until I got addicted to. 

Now I’m 14 (First year in high school) where I’m  having  problems with my marks.
Yesterday my mum and I went to  a lunch with some of her friends until, in the late afternoon , I asked her if she could bring me back home so I do my homework
She got angry but we headed  back home.
After I’ve done my homework she gets furious because it took me 2h and 30 min so tell her that I was missing my art book and I couldn’t study it.
So my mum and I started searching it until I said that one of my class mate could have it.
She got mad. She start yelling at me about how I’m so dumb and retarded , then she ask me to ask on my class group for the photos( I literally have 2 friend there and I don’t want to fuck up) and i tell  her “OK”.
After about an hour my mum rushed into my room screaming where the hell are the photos and start beating me up and insulting me , after 10 min of calling me “ retard”  she felt sick and ran out, my father instantly walk into my room breaking the door saying “ How dare you , Make your mum sick , tomorrow I’ll to your school and you will get kicked out of it. You are useless , that won’t make anything in life ” while he is breaking my things (phone, calculator etc. ) then he ran to my mum screaming. 

Now the my both said that are not gonna pay for my food , water or just anything that is correlated to me. 
They broke my computer and almost kill my cat( He is my best friend and he helped me during the years)
Now I ‘m at school but closed in my room with my tablet afraid of them.

What should I do ? Call someone?",Filogiallo6,2019-04-01 02:33:55,5,398,18.66,33.46,94.13,1,24.88,11.56,94.97,59.3,26.13,21.61,15.83,0.25,1.26,3.77,0.5,4.52,2.76,12.81,7.29,5.78,8.54,1.26,16.58,3.52,1.26,1.26,2.01,2.01,6.03,1.01,5.03,0.5,2.26,0.75,14.32,2.26,1.51,4.77,1.26,8.79,0.75,1.76,2.01,3.27,0,1.76,3.02,1.01,1.76,0.25,2.01,0,1.01,0.25,0.75,7.04,2.26,0.75,2.01,2.26,0.5,5.53,8.79,1.76,17.84,2.26,6.53,9.55,3.77,1.51,2.01,0.25,0.25,0.25,1.76,1.26,0.25,0.25,0,0,14.82,3.77,3.52,0,0,0.5,0,0,1.76,2.26,3.02,0

b8bsqi,Anonymous Facebook message warning about Father,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for answers here before I go to the local police station to see what can be done.

I am a 24 year old male and was threatened by my father. He plead guilty in December 2018 and has what is essentially a no contact restraining order. But as of right now we have recently learned that he is currently in Vietnam (we are of Viet descent). 

Someone from facebook (no profile picture or mutual friends) message my mother with a picture of my father with some other people, and he had his hands around a woman. The message says that my dad is getting to know this woman who is mutual friends with people we know. This woman also knows gangsters. My dad is currently planning on hurting my mother and she needs to be careful.

This is extremely alarming but I have no clue on what the next actions are. This is not a threat, this is an anonymous message, and this is outside of Canada (I live in Toronto, Ontario). Is there anything that can be done to mitigate the chances of harm to my mother?",b003k,2019-04-01 17:19:43,4,200,42.76,82.9,36.95,1,16.67,21.5,91,58,18,10,6,1.5,0,2.5,0,8,5,13.5,13,4,5,2,17.5,2.5,1.5,2,1,1,3.5,0,3.5,2,1,0.5,18.5,4,1.5,3.5,5,8.5,3,0,0.5,2,1,2.5,3.5,2,0.5,1,1,0.5,0.5,0,0,11,6,0.5,2.5,0.5,2.5,2.5,16.5,0.5,10.5,1,4.5,4.5,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.5,5,2.5,0,1,0.5,0,0,0,0.5,3,1
b8fasd,My Escape from My Abuser (steps),"I thought this might be something that helps another person in my situation.  Please be aware, that I was not married to my abuser, nor did we have children or a mortgage, so I realise that my situation is not as difficult to get out of.  However, if you’re feeling overwhelmed this might be a good starting point.  

This is also helpful for me to just get this stuff out there.  So thank you. 


STEP ONE: TELL SOMEONE 

The first step I took was telling someone.  It was in art to seek help, but my primary motivation was to have someone external that I was accountable to.  I wasn’t able to rugsweep his abuse once I had set that ball rolling. 

Now who you tell is important.  You need this person to be supportive, but you also need them to be discreet.  If you’re leaving a lot of people with have the knee-jerk reaction to be a white knight.  You know the type, the ones that want to kick the door down and beat up your abuser.  These are usually the people that, while having the best intentions, are most likely going to make your situation 1000% percent worse.  The most dangerous time for the person in an abusive relationship is when they are leaving it.  And the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  

You need to tell people who will be your Seal Team Six.  The ones who will keep it quiet, support you where they can, and if they are part of your “extraction team” they will be in, out, and done.  No drama, No confrontation. No fights. 

It might make the white knights in your life feel better, but they often don’t realise you just want to get out alive.  They don’t realise that you’re probably still half in love with your abuser.  Your mind is garbled up.  You don’t need people attacking your abuser (either verbally or physically) because in your mind your abuser is still the person you love.  You just don’t love the abuse.  

You need this person to have their focus be 100% on you and your wellbeing.  Communicate this or even send them what I’ve written here to express it to them.  A lot of people in my life had to be calmed down.  It wasn’t a task I enjoyed doing, but it was necessary.  Most people don’t have any clue how to react in this scenario.  Be forgiving of that.  But do not let them put you in further danger. 


STEP TWO: THE BUG OUT BAG 

My bug out bag wasn’t even a bag.  I had simply hidden away my passports, some money, the spare key to my car and an emergency credit card in a hidden place.  I kept it tucked away in the bookshelf that I would need to go past if I had to run for the door in case he went into another rage.  Keep it in a place he won’t find it, and make sure its not a place where you’ll get cornered if you have to go fetch it.  


STEP THREE: FIND YOUR LODESTONE

This step was necessary for me to remember who I was before the abuse, before the gaslighting and self-doubt, before I had been essentially broken down into this terrified shell.  Your lodestone should be something that you can cling onto while the waves of self-doubt wash over you, when you think maybe it wasn’t that bad, or that things might get better.  Your emotions will be a cyclone during all of this.  We’ve all gone through or seen people undergo a break up.  People dealing with heartbreak are a mess.  You are in this position with a whole host of other terrifying factors.  Its natural to feel confused and overwhelmed.  My functionality during this time was negligible.  

My lodestone was from a simple joke I used to make.  I used to always say I would never take a bet that I wouldn’t win.  This was in reference to usually betting $20 on a hockey game.  I had to reason with myself that if I wasn’t going to bet $20 freaking dollars, why on earth would I be willing gamble with my life on the off-chance that he wouldn’t lose control again?
 
Find something simple for you to hold onto.  Something that reminds you of who you are.  It doesn’t need to be anything huge or deeply philosophical.  It just needs to be a little lifesaver ring to hold onto while there is this torrent of emotions around you.  

Remember, your abuser may turn on the charm after an episode.  They may be apologetic.  

I was rather lucky in that my abuser was in such hard denial he refused to go to therapy.  Refused to quit drinking, and refused to even properly apologize (sorry buddy, but saying I “provoked you” into strangling me because we were in a fight isn’t going to fly as a legitimate apology). 
Don’t let them make you forget what they did to you.  It’ll get harder to stay angry when the physical signs of the abuse fade, or if there were none to begin with.  You have known yourself your entire life.  You didn’t make up that fear, that pain, that feeling in your gut.  You’re brain is trying to cope and you’re most likely in shock.  My emotions didn’t get unblocked until a good two months later and its still ongoing.  


STEP FOUR: GRAY ROCKING/ 50s HOUSEWIFE 

This step is incredibly difficult.  You need to act like everything is normal until everything is place.  There are moments where your emotions may get the better of you.  The weekend before I left I got lucky because my period hit (woohoo no surprise baby to worry about, and I had an excuse for having my emotions be a little off the rails).  I used my hormones as an excuse for why I was crying.  However, I did NOT let on that the tears were from stress, depression, panic, and simply being completely overwhelmed.  

I pretended my tears were me being so moved about adorable dog rescue videos and heart-warming stories online.  My abuser was mildly bemused, but he accepted this.  You know yourself better than anyone else does.  

Sometimes you can’t control your emotions, but you can control what they believe the root cause of these emotions are. 

Do not engage in anything that will make him angry.  It made me sick to do this, but I was sweet and loving and made dinner on time, and kept the house clean.  I didn’t encourage any of his rages, but I also listened.  If you get overwhelmed, sometimes you can get away with faking an illness.  Sometimes its easier if you pre-empt by pretending you’re already sick.  


STEP FIVE: PREPARING FO RAPID DEPARTURE 

You need to take steps for your departure.  For me, this meant PLANNING.  I needed to think about all my contingencies. 
I had a dog.  I was in another country.  We had a joint bank account.  I was planning to ghost him, so I wanted there to be no reason that I had to get into contact with him.  

It was during this phase that I thought the worst of him.  It wasn’t that I thought he would trash my credit in a vendetta.  But I also never thought he would strangle me like that. So at this point I had to accept that maybe I didn’t know him at all and therefore, in order to protect myself, I needed to think the worst of him.  
So I secretly began to go through our things under the guise of tidying up the house.  I secretly separated out all of our documents.  In drawers where we kept joint winter clothing, I separated my stuff onto the left and his things onto the right.  I did the same with the books and other areas where our things ha mingled. 
For packing, I secretly packed 90% of my clothing into suitcases and kept the suitcases where they always were.  I left out enough clothing in drawers and even hung up his unused formal clothing into my closet so on a quick glance it looked like all my clothes were still there.  This meant the day I left my packing job took me under an hour. 

For the dog, I took steps to ensure that she was legally in my name.  I updated hr registration and microchip so that I was the sole owner.  I did not update the address because I wanted there to be no way for him to track where I was going.  I spoke to the vet’s office and got her put under my name only.  I took off his name and his family as “emergency contacts.” I got her paperwork in order to bring her across the border with me.  

For the car, I got it tuned up since I was going to be driving it across the country with me.  

I rang the post office because when I put the mail forwarding in place, I wanted to ensure that my new address was not going to be broadcast to him in any way shape or form.  

Everything I needed to search for in google was done in incognito mode.  I was leaving no trace that I was going to leave his ass.  
I even cleaned out the car that weekend so that was one less thing to worry about.  Think about anything you can do that will make your escape easier without raising any alarm bells. 


STEP SIX: LEAVING 

I was lucky that one of my good long-time friends was prepared to fly out and do the drive back with me.  I had the day picked out when I knew my abuser was going to be out at work, when I would have the house to myself to pack, and that I would have a few good hours to put plenty of distance between myself and him.  

My friend flew in the night before and spent the night at the airport (an absolute angel of human being), before taxiing over immediately when the coast was clear.  And then we started packing like mad. My friend was in charge of tetrising the luggage in the car.  My job was sprinting around the house and piling all of my things at the front door.  I had to leave a few things behind, but I had already accepted that I might not be able to take everything.  

Then we went to the gas station and filled up the car.  It was the last time I was going to use the card on the joint account for anything. There was no way I was going to leave a paper trail for him to follow.  

Then I went to the post office and set up mail forwarding to my new address. 

Then I went to the bank and drained the joint bank account (in cash), closed the account since most joint accounts allow you to do that unilaterally, and separated out half of it.  I took my half and he got his half.  (I had some guilt about taking the money since he was working while I was waiting on my work permit to come through.  I justified this be realising I had given up years investing in this guy and had moved to a foreign country for him.  Taking my half of our finances from our shared and now tattered life was the LEAST he owed me.  I took half because I knew I needed some finances to get myself back on my feet so I couldn’t take nothing, but I also couldn’t take all of it because the lst thing I wanted was him coming after me legally for his half of the money.  Just do it 50-50, be fair about it and don’t give your abuser the option of coming after you for any reason.  Be FAIR even if it’s hard to be the bigger person). 

I left his money in an envelope on the table, left the key in the lock box, and hit the open road.  

After five hours, I sent his father a text message saying politely that he had strangled me, that I fled without him knowing, and to please look after him.  I also thanked him for looking after me.  
I kept casually talking to my abuser on messenger until I knew he was coming home from work.  Then I blocked him. That was last time I have spoken to him.  I have no replied to any of his emails or any of his harassing of my friends to get me to contact him. 


STEP SIX: HIDING

I lay low at my friend’s house for a few weeks after I left.  I didn’t want to go to any of the usual places my abuser would expect me to go to (mutual friends of ours, my family, etc).  I picked a friend who my abuser didn’t know and definitely didn’t know the home address of. 

I didn’t even tell my family the exact address.  I let my parents know what town I was in and that was it.  None of my friends knew what location I had gone to.  This isn’t because I thought they would betray me to him.  This is because a small innocuous slip-up could have led him straight to my friend’s door.  I went underground and the most people were getting from me was that I was safe. 

As far as my abuser was concerned, I could have gone anywhere in the world and that’s exactly what I wanted him to think.  I most definitely DID NOT hide in the obvious places (like my parent’s house).

b8joww,"Finally got some help 3 weeks ago, problems at work ever since","On March 12 I finally turned in my son's father who got the most violent he ever had been towards me. In short, he threw water on me while in bed after arguing, threw the same cup at me, put me in a chokehold, pushed me away from the door many times, stole my car fob and phone, threw me over his shoulders with me going on my stomach hard, etc. That's the short version of course. I went to the closest urgent care who in turn called the police. They arrested him and had him in jail overnight yay!

Here's the shitty part: my employer knows about this domestic violence incident, since I went to the er the next day after being with advocates and in the courtroom, as they saw more injuries the urgent care and cops didn't catch. I've received phone calls from sheriffs telling me about what happened when they tried serving him, police officers following up with me, advocates from a few places, my attorney representing me for the restraining order case, the works. My manager tells me about my productivity being down and that I ""can't keep leaving to take care of personal business"". 

Oh and because I'm upset about his mother harassing me, who unfortunately by no choice financially watches our son often times until I get off work. Since this incident my parents have been doing what they can and I'm in the works of getting new childcare. However, I know I saw his truck about a mile from my job one night driving on the other side of the road (btw it's 30 min from the apt we lived in together, he has zero reason to be near my job). I no longer feel safe going to or from work, my manager who never cared for me is harassing me about my productivity (like who can work under such great stress and little sleep and food), and I honestly just want to leave. I hope to god I get granted this permanent DVPO, so I can get off our lease this month. I am contemplating quitting this job by putting in a 4 weeks notice or so to get rid of this job when I'm off this stupid lease (am now with my parents). I have money saved up to where I could be fine for a good while after I'm off the lease. All I know is that I'm more stuck with my abuser's family the more I pick him up from there. I know they're a part of my life for good but I want to barely see them if at all possible. 

Has anyone quit their job because of domestic violence related issues, or their bosses being unrealistic and threatening your job? Is it possible to get unemployment in NC after leaving job related to domestic violence?

b8sp4q,*Long Post* I am Alive.,"I haven't posted on here yet but it's been long overdue....I apologize in advance for bad formatting and run on sentences, I'm on mobile. I don't really know where to begin my story...so I'm just going to start it!
 My ex was arrested on September 27th of this past year for hiring someone to kill me. That someone saved my life because instead of taking the money, he didn't go to the cops- he went to detectives. This person was my neighbor and a good kid. We had lived in the apartment we were in for roughly 8 or 9 months, and a few of my neighbors knew my husband was abusive but no one knew how to help besides talk to me (which was super helpful tbh). 
There was a night....July 31st, he held a gun to his head. I called the cops. He took my phone from me, and had me arrested for trying to get my phone back. I pulled his shirt, the cop was one of his National Guard buddies...he was fine though because the bruises I got didnt show up till after I had been booked. It was really horrible. My little boy who had never been away from his mommy ended up with separation anxiety that is only just now starting to subside. I have never been to jail, and as horrible as that was for me, it was worse for him. I moved in with my mom and step dad and they have been so proactive and supportive for/with me this whole time, I am beyond blessed for them both. 
 He filed a restraining order against me and lied and said it was for my baby, too. I didn't see my angel for a week. By this time, I had gotten in touch with the Hubbard House and my lawyer took the time and made sure, that I could in fact see my baby. He helped me file my second injunction  (I had filed for one that June but if course it got thrown out) and helped me to stay strong. He is a kind man...who is giant and looks terrifying, like an American Hagrid! He is still working for me now, because the aftermath has been horrible. 
 He destroyed all of our personal documents (except my birth certificate), the only thing I have for my son is my Mütterpass (I had my little guy in Germany, but we are American!) It is 6 months later and still the only thing I've obtained for him is his medical records. 
 The time in between my going to jail and him going to jail was a nightmare of never knowing what would happen next, even with restraining orders against each other, he was so unstable. I was not as surprised as I should have been when I got that call. 
 I get home with my little dude around 7:30 pm and we get right into our night time routine of dinner, bath, books, and bed. Halfway in to bath time I get a call from a familiar number (at this point I had dealt with cops so many times I just figured it was them). I pick up and it's a woman's voice. She asks me to sit down and that she is in the process of having my husband taken in to custody, that he tried to make an attemot on my life and am I still residing at my mom's as she wants to send over a plain clothes detective to talk to me. Just, ever so matter of factly...I went right to my mom and asked her to take over bath time and I started to hyperventilate. I didn't want my little guy to see anymore of this. My stepdad asked me what was wrong and I told him. That's around when the detective shows up. Tells me what he is allowed to tell me, and searched my car. That asshole had a loaded gun, 2 loaded magazines, and a GPS tracker in my car. I am alive. My son is alive. We are ok. There is so much more to all of this, and I will gladly explain more in the comments..I'm from Florida, sooooo the arrest report and all of that information is available to the public. I just needed to get it out cause oh man you guys. I am so depressed. I have not had time off from working or parenting at all to process this (I know, I should but I truly can't afford to). I have no health insurance so no time or money for a psych eval... I have so much to be happy and thankful for, and oh trust me, I am. But. I am just so tired of fighting. I'm never going to stop though, my son is too precious to me to ever not be a strong woman and fight for us. But damn man, I need a break. And if anyone has any advice I am all ears. This is a lonely, shitty road to navigate, but I would rather be here than dead.

b8yc5c,Is there anything I can do to help a customer who suffered domestic violence in my place of work?,"I work as a manger in a retail store and we get quite busy. One of my colleagues came up to me and said he was told that a lady has been stealing. I went to have a look and saw a woman with three children crying. She had many bruises and just looked fed up. I asked her if she was alright and she said her partner just hit her and ran off, her kids was al teary eyed and holding on close to her. I offered to give her some number to a woman’s shelter and call the police but she didn’t want anything doing. She ended up ringing her sister and I stayed nearby to make sure she got in the car safe.

After watching cctv I saw he hit her in the face twice and threw a bottle of pop at her then ran off. Having dealt with domestic violence through my childhood and in previous relationships this has really hit home and I wish I could do more to help.

Is there anything I can do? Or is it just a case of hoping she leaves him before her or her kids get seriously hurt?

b90wpi,"I need advice on how to get checked out for something medical, I don't have insurance and I'm not sure what to do","Long story short my boyfriend and I broke up and after a week when we were in a drunken fight he choked me. It wasn't long and I didn't lose consciousness or anything, and I had no bruises the next day. My throat was very sore the next day though and it's gotten better each day but I feel like I can still feel it, like soreness in general and when I swallow. I can't tell if I'm just anxious and paranoid or if I should see a doctor. I'm hearing a lot of stories of survivors who were choked and were fine but also that it's super dangerous and I should see a doctor. It's really conflicting. 

I do not have health insurance. I have not been able to find work since graduating college. I'm 24 but the person who provided coverage in our family retired and their benefits changed or something? So I lost my coverage about a year ago. I barely have any money in my bank account now. Fortunately I'm back home with my parents (like I moved back to my home state) but I'm still super worried about this. I went to an urgent care the next day but they just said that they only have an X-ray and it wouldn't be helpful for something that could be muscular or whatnot and to go to the local hospital. I really cannot afford this, like I looked up how much a CT scan costs later that day at the hospital there and it's more than I have in my bank account right now. I can find work out here and stuff but right now my most pressing issue is this I think.

b9g0k7,"Neighbor hearing a lot of abuse coming from downstairs for months, don't know what to do","I don't know if this is the right place to ask this question or even if I should ask this question.  

For quite some time I keep hearing my downstairs neighbor beating up his girlfriend.  
Panging cries of despair that go through marrow and bone for hours on end.  
Stuff like please not with the keys not with the keys before hearing a loud bang and harder crying.  
Called the cops once when I heard it and it never ended.

Today was such a day again and I went down after hearing her cry for like 30 minutes, feel like cry is an understatement here.  
I rang the bell and she showed herself before the window make up all smeared over her face, didn't open the door.
I asked here if everything was ok because I heard her crying for so long.
She immediately apologized for her sadness, which I assured her was unnecessary.
She said she was good, she didn't seem good at all.
Said that if I could help her with anything I'm her upstairs neighbor and left.

I kept ignoring it for all this time because well it didn't seem like my place to meddle in their affairs.  
But the crying it just makes me very angry and makes me feel powerless.  
I don't want to make her situation worse or anything I just want to help in some way and make it stop somehow.

Is there anything I can do here or is it best for me to just ignore it and let them deal with it.  
I don't want to intervene while it's not my place but the crying, it has to stop somehow.

Any word of advice here?",velocity010,2019-04-04 10:54:58,10,300,28.27,40.79,58.78,2.41,16.67,13,95,60.33,21,13,7.33,0,0,5,0.67,8,4.33,13.33,8,6.33,7.67,3.67,21.33,2.33,3.33,1,0.67,2.33,7.33,2.33,5,0,0.67,3,13.67,0,1.33,4.67,0.33,17,2.67,2.33,3,7,2,5,4.67,0.33,3.33,1,0.67,0.67,0,0,0,6.67,2,0.67,3.67,1,1,6,12,0.33,15.33,1,7.67,6.67,0,0,1.67,0,0,0,0.67,0,0,0.33,0.33,0,10.67,5.33,2,0,0,0.33,0,0,0,3,0,0

I've had my abusive ex blocked on all social medias for as long as I could remember, including Facebook. However today I checked my block list and realised his name is no longer on the list. Does this mean he deleted his account? I have begun to panic really hard as I can not find his account no longer on facebook and am very scared that he can search for me, or if he has made a new account.

What steps can I take to protect my identity?

b9wkx8,Was in a bad marriage for 20 years-I got out and found the love of my life.,"20 years married to a narcissist and I finally got out.  Cheated on me.  Always accused me of cheating on him. Made me afraid to speak to any other man he didn’t know. Made me feel like I’d never make it on my own.  I couldn’t tell him how I felt about anything. It was always turned around and it would be my fault.  I was always saying I’m sorry. Even if I hadn’t done anything. If things weren’t done his way it was bad.  There’s so much more that I’m sure others have experienced as well. Too many to name. He Started drinking and taking pills. It got even worse.  He never hit me but I was afraid a few times he was going to shoot me with the gun he’d have in his hand.  Got out Christmas 2016.  He’s asked people to come to where I live and hurt me and destroy my things-said he’d pay them.  Told several people he’d kill me. 

Fast forward to 2018-met a great guy. Loving, makes me feel like I’m the only one. Been together for 1 year now.  It’s the kind of relationship that you dream about. You fantasize about.

Today: I was feeling very anxious about something he had casually mentioned to me. So I messaged him at work. Told him my concerns and guess what? He approached them with love and honesty.  Not screaming and placing the blame on me.  He talked with me about it and let me know it was ok to have these feelings and to talk to him about it.  

You see we’re a team.  We’re a partnership.  We’re in it for all the right reasons.  To know that he loves me the way he does is amazing.  To get to feel something I’ve never had before because I was never first in anyone’s eyes until now.  Always sends me messages to make sure my days going ok. He makes sure I know that I’m loved. We’re open and honest with each other. Sometimes I forget that it’s that easy if I have a problem to just go to him.  He’s my rock. We both have our issues/problems. But difference is that we share those with each other. We lean on each other. 

It’s out there you just have to be brave and take that first step.  It’s hard I know but I know you can do it.  You have to get away from the abuse. The negativity. The evil. Trust that it’s gonna be ok.",beckyp1234,2019-04-05 13:59:05,14,441,12.97,65.86,63.88,33.6,9,10.2,97.05,62.36,27.66,18.82,9.98,1.81,1.36,5.22,0.45,8.84,3.85,13.15,11.79,6.35,5.67,2.27,24.04,3.63,1.59,0.68,1.81,2.49,9.3,4.76,4.31,0.68,1.36,0.45,16.55,0.45,0.45,0,5.67,14.06,3.17,2.04,1.59,2.72,2.72,3.4,3.63,0.45,0.91,2.04,2.27,0.45,0.68,0,0.45,10.43,5.22,1.36,0.23,2.27,1.59,7.94,15.19,0.68,13.38,2.49,5.67,5.9,0.68,1.13,0,0.23,0.23,0.23,1.13,0,0.23,0.68,0.23,0,18.37,10.88,0.23,0.23,0,0.23,0,0.68,0,5.9,0,0.23

b9ychq,Everyone was right,"“You’re going to end up in the hospital because of him.” 

Everyone was right. I’m going to the hospital tonight. For the second night. Last night I was in the ER for 6 hours before I left at 3am bc I was too tired to wait anymore and I had to work today. Luckily I worked from home. 

Got a massive black eye on Saturday. Vision started acting funny yesterday when I was back working. 

Called out of work Monday bc black eye. Now on probation and can’t miss a day for at least 2 months. 

My uncle passed away Saturday and we had the viewing Tuesday. I missed the funeral Wednesday bc I was too embarrassed bc of everyone asking me about my face on Tuesday. I hope my family forgives me.

I now have symptoms of a detached or torn retina. 

Called eye doc today, thinking they could squeeze me in tomorrow. They told me to go straight to the emergency room. 

He’s been 3000 miles away on vacation away since the day it happened. I’ve minimized the situation until tonight. 

I’m praying that I don’t need major surgery. I know I should press charges or get a protection order but I would rather not face him in court if I don’t have to. Maybe I’ll have the strength to do it after going through this ordeal with the hospital. 

I contacted the national domestic violence hotline today. Chatted online. Completely unhelpful for me.  Basically just telling me they’re sorry that happened and it shouldn’t happen to me. Yea, no shit. 

I need to know what my options are in my state. They sent me a website. Then I wasn’t active on the chat for 5 mins while working and they disconnected and I lost all the info they sent me.",xocrollinxo,2019-04-05 16:45:13,7,306,52.9,22.62,98.61,20.79,10.2,18.95,92.16,56.86,18.95,15.36,12.09,0.33,0.33,0.98,1.63,3.59,6.21,14.38,9.15,3.92,6.21,2.29,21.24,3.27,0.98,0.65,1.63,0.65,4.25,1.96,2.29,0.33,0.33,1.31,9.15,0.65,0,0,1.31,11.11,1.63,1.96,2.94,2.29,1.63,2.61,2.61,1.96,0,0.65,4.25,2.29,1.96,0,0,5.88,1.31,1.96,1.63,0.65,0.33,8.5,10.13,3.27,21.9,2.29,8.5,11.11,1.63,1.31,1.31,0,0.33,0.33,2.29,0.33,1.63,0.33,0.33,0,14.71,9.48,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0.65,3.92,0,0

ba1l9y,Shelters are not an option for every woman (and that's ok) and there need to be better options instead,"Hi everyone, so, i'm not going to share my full DV story today, that's for another time... but I do want to talk about something that frustrates me a LOT, and that's that women who are fleeing sometimes have no other option than a general homeless shelter or womens shelter (which is not specific to DV victims) and they aren't always appropriate for those situations.   


When I was fleeing I did stay in a shelter for a short time. There are no shelters specific to DV where I was, only general homeless shelters and a womens shelter. I opted for the womens shelter as I figured at least there I would probably be able to access resources and it would be safer. Now, I want to make clear that this was only my personal experience and I'm sure there are women who've had positive experiences in shelters.   


My experience was neither safe nor helpful. My abuser was out on bail and the first thing he did when he got out was make off with every dime in my bank account, which i didn't even know he could access. I was pennyless but I had a home. Only a few days after his release I was made aware he'd be coming to my house and staring at me from my windows, had started using scary drugs like meth and was very erratic and unpredictable. He even showed up at the door of a mutual friends of ours and tried to kick the door in after the friend refused to let him in for what he did to me and for being on drugs. Then I started getting strange notes from him in my mailbox or taped to my door. It was made clear to me through victims services that my risk at this point was very high and I could not be staying at my home, especially because I lived alone. Because he wasn't showing up to any of the stuff he'd been ordered to the first few days another warrant was issued and I was told to go find somewhere else to stay until he was behind bars again because it wasn't safe to stay in my home. My rent was paid, but other than that, I had NOTHING. I was thousands of miles from friends and family so I couldn't just pop over and stay with someone. I knew NO ONE in this city. In addition to that, I was so humiliated that i'd lied to my mother and told her that i'd left this guy long ago, and I couldn't bring myself to call her and ask her for money or help, even though she would have given it. So my only choice seemed to be a shelter.   


As this was just a *general* womens shelter, I was actually the only one there fleeing DV. Because the city I was in had a massive drug and homelessness problem, ALL the other women in the shelter were homeless and addicted to drugs. For me, that was an incredibly unsafe and triggering. The first day I was there, I woke up in the morning at 6:30 sharp to a shelter worker screaming that everyone had to ""get out"". I was SO confused. It was explained to me that the shelter was only for use between 5:00 PM and 7:00 AM. Basically, they let the women in at 5 for dinner, and then they're allowed to sit in the dining room until 7:00 PM when they open the door to the bunks. Then you can access your bunk and the little cubby on the end where you have your belongings to take a shower, change, and get ready for bed. Then you go to sleep,wake up at 6:30, and have to be out by 7:00. No exceptions. Some of these women had lived for weeks like this, in the dead of winter, and I have no idea how. The girl on the bunk across from me had bandages all over her head, covered in blood. When they came to wake her she tried to tell them that she was disoriented and couldn't stand. She explained that she was sleeping on the road two nights prior and someone came and hit her with a GOLF CLUB until her head split open. She took off the bandages to show that she had about a 6 inch laceration on her scalp where her hair had been shaved and her head stitched that was now bleeding. The response from staff was that they could call an ambulance if she wanted to go back to the hospital, but she could not stay inside.   


I looked at the shelter worker, and confused, asked her ""Where am I supposed to go?"" She LAUGHED at me, and said ""wherever you want to go honey, but you can't stay here. don't you have anything you can do downtown?"" By ""Downtown"" she meant a very specific part of downtown, where all the other women went during the day to use drugs, sell stolen goods and sell sex. I know that sounds harsh - but it is the truth. Now, full, disclosure, I am a recovered drug addict. This is going to make me sound holier-than-thou, but I was just a rich brat getting high in my car when I used drugs. I don't know anything about the streets. Just being around women that I knew did drugs was triggering for me and made me feel very unsafe. Especially when I walked into the bathroom that morning and saw it was fully stocked with fresh needles, cottons, wipes and cookers.   


I tried to track down another staff member because I was still in disbelief that I was being asked to just go wander about the streets all the day. I also had no phone, because my abuser had literally snapped mine in half. I did have my tablet, but I was too afraid to take it out or use it, because even in the short time I was there I realized that theft was a big problem (I literally woke up in the night to two women screaming that one had stolen the others shoes. They were kicked out,but it still scared me). I tried to explain to the staff member that I was a DV victim, that I wasn't from this city, that I didn't feel safe being sent out into the street for the day. She basically told me too bad, get lost. So I went outside and used a payphone to call the female police officer who'd driven me to the shelter and given me her card. I explained what was happening and how this wasn't the right place for me and asked could anyone (didn't have to be her, i knew she must be busy, but perhaps someone from victim services) help me find a more appropriate place to go. That officer, bless her heart, drove all the way down there on her OWN time to the shelter and basically gave them hell and told them to let me inside to make phone calls to other places, and they did.   


So there I am, in this shelter i'm not even supposed to be inside at this time of day, using a decades old landline phone to call every number on this little pamplet. It went almost exactly like this (I remember these calls because of how devastatingly frustrating it was):  
""Sorry, we're full""  
""Sorry, we only take youth 15-21""  
""Sorry, we're full""  
""Sorry, we're full""  
""We're actually shelter for mental health, so you have to have a clinically diagnosed mental illness to stay here""  
""Sorry, we're long-term, you have to be planning to stay at least six months and have come from \*\*other shelter\*\* before coming to us""  
""Sorry, we're full""  
""Yes, we are a domestic violence shelter! We're in \*\*city\*\* 4 hours away however, and you do need to apply online with your victim services case number and we'll get back to you in 48 hours to let you know if we have any space"".  


That last one broke me. Every shelter was one of two things:  
\-Too broad, accepted anyone, often men included, drug use and theft rampant  
\-Too specific and too small, required me to have or do things that I didn't or couldn't in my situation, or had so few beds the chances of me getting one were nearly impossible (as one place put it, they're a clean, welcoming, supportive womens transition home with 6 beds that no one wants to give up and has a very long wait list).   


There was not a single place in a BIG city for a women in a CRISIS situation to go that was safe and appropriate. I am not in a third world country where these things are insanely taboo. This is a western country with the #metoo movement and many brave women speaking up about their experiences. And when I needed a safe place to go for a few days because my LIFE WAS IN DANGER, I was shit out of luck.

So what did I do? I went home.  


I called the officer back and told her that I would be going back home, even though she strongly advised against it (I wanted the police to know exactly where I was so they'd know where to find me if I was in trouble). And I did. I sat in my house with no money and NO PHONE to call the police with if he showed up (and he did). At this point, he'd actually somehow figured out that I was staying in a shelter anyway (I don't know exactly how, but I do know he was stalking me and had tapped my laptop and my social media) and would have come looking for me. And how am I supposed to be protected from him if I have to be OUTSIDE for more than 12 hours during the day? I wasn't safe at home, and I wasn't safe in that shelter. All I could do was pick the lesser of the two bad choices and for me, that was at the very least being in my own home.   


Again - I ABSOLUTELY get that some people stay in shelters and are safe and find help. I am not saying they are all 100% definitely bad. But for a person who's lived a certain type of life, especially the kind of person who's never had to access any kind of community resources like shelters, welfare, etc before like me, it can be a very harrowing experience.   


So what needs to be done?  I honestly don't fucking know. If you were hoping that I had a solution to this at the end, I don't. I know what would help though... domestic violence SPECIFIC shelters with ENOUGH space that women aren't as high a risk of being turned away and sent to these ""general"" homeless shelters. If necessary, women could be put up in a hotel for a day or two while they wait for a bed (after being notified one will be definitely available at that time, of course). Giving places that aren't DV shelters at LEAST the training to know what to do and how to help if someone comes in with that issue. A woman who's abuser is looking for her and has threatened to kill her when he finds her should NEVER be left to wait outside on the streets alone all day.   


Also, I just want to let other women know that if you for any reason decide that a shelter isn't for you, it. is. ok. I feel like sometimes people will just comment ""call a shelter"" or ""omg, go to a shelter now!!!"" and it's like ok, that's REALLY easy to say, but some people just aren't comfortable with that for any number of reasons. Maybe they're like me and being around drugs is really, really scary. Maybe they have OCD and can't be around that many people. Or maybe they've just never been in a situation before where they have had to do something like use a shelter. Am I saying you should put your pride before your safety? Absolutely not. But I understand your hesitation. It's only human.   


Anyway, as I said, I ended up going home, contacting my family and confessing that I hadn't left him when I said I did. They were angry but helped me financially until I recovered what had been taken from me and got me a new phone. My ex did come after me, and he did come to my house, but that's too long a story so we're going to end it here.   


I just wish that our politicians saw the importance of having safe places and useful resources for women who are in the situation that I was in. Because it should never ever have to be that hard.  


Hope each one of you are safe and well &lt;3

ba9vee,My not-so girlfriend.,"TL;DR - I fell in love with someone who thought they were in love with me. Gave everything I could to provide for and uplift her, and it turns out she has been lying an basically cheating on, using me, this entire time.


Hello everyone, before I get into this I’ll give some information about myself. I’m a 29 year old guy. I’m currently a sex offender for the next couple of years for committing a crime that never had a real person, nor a victim. Ive paid my debt to society, went through treatment, and have been focusing on building my life once more. I currently have a full time job, and I’m living in a decently nice hotel until I can find a permanent residence. 

I’ve now been here for close to a year. Within the first month that I moved here I met a woman who I’ll call Clair. The first night that we met was spectacular. We connected on a level that I had never experienced before with anyone else. She also lives in the room right next to mine. After it got so late, I walked her to her door and we exchanged numbers that was it. Over the next couple of weeks we talked and hung out on a regular basis. She has two boys and her mother living with her, so her time is limited in some ways. We both that things that we wanted to tell one another, and I had severe anxiety for a week about explaining to her my charge and the circumstances surrounding it. I made it a point that I needed to talk to her, but events in her life and time made it hard to do so. One night, we ended up making love, and it was probably the most beautiful experiences I’ve ever had. 

The next day, I finally found the opportunity to lay in bed and discuss everything with her and I broke down doing so. I told her everything, from my charge to losing my kids and my family, everything.. I wanted to tell her before anything got too complex and complicated between us, but I also wanted her to know who I am, the type of guy that I am, before doing so and scaring her away. Almost at the end of my story, she started crying with me because she could see what had happened and felt the pain and depression of it all. She explained that she didn’t look at me any different, nor was scared or anything of the sort.
I was scared that what I told her would end our friendship, but I knew going into it that it was a very real possibility and I accepted that.

Over the course of the next few months we continued to spend time together almost on a daily basis. I came to find out that she has a severe prescription pill problem, along with a few other people in her family. On a couple of nights that we would drink together, a friend would give her a couple of Xanax and she would let me hold onto them so she wouldn’t take them. When she would want them, I declined to give them to her and in turn she would get violent and abusive. This has happened numerous times.

She has gotten so fucked up that her 4 year old son would be wondering outside without any supervision, while she is passed out. I’ve tried to do everything I can to support her in her sobriety. Whether it be us participating in AA/NA, finding resources for work, emotional support, everything I can think of. It boiled down to me threatening to call CPS on her for fear that something would happen to her children because she chose to place her addiction over them. 

Fast forward to the last few months. We have periods of time lasting up to a month to where everything is amazing between us. We don’t fight,we hardly ever argue, everything will be great. There have been times where we were both drink, and she would end up falling asleep. Because of the way that she acts and the type of person that I know she can be, I have went through her phone when she would sleep and found a lot of things that I couldn’t believe. Now I know that I am wrong for going through her phone. It’s disgusting and an invasion of privacy, every time I have done it I hate myself for doing so because there should be a string of trust in there, but my suspicion gets to me.

She takes a mixture of somas and Vicodin to get her high, to basically the same effect as heroin. The guy that she gets them from is a big black dude and he will text things like come over and watch movies with me, but he’s very sexual about it openly. She’s always told me how disgusting he is physically, and that she’s never been with a black guy, nor is she attracted to them. I’m not racist, but a pretty little white girl going over to a black guy’s house for pills, throws up all types of red flags. Or anyone’s house for that matter. 

I have accused her of sleeping with a few different people and also messing around with other people. There have been times where she would refute and explain the situation from a different perspective and I would understand. But there are also things that I KNOW she is lying about. And for whatever reason, just cannot be truthful about them. Her and I both pay our rent on a weekly basis. Last Wednesday she did not have any money to pay her rent, and keep in mind that she has two young sons along with her sick mother that live with her. She didn’t ask me, to but I told her that I would take a loan out with my company so that I can pay her rent and that she could pay me back when she could afford it. She was in my room before I got home and we went to go pay the rent, after that I saw her for a total of about 15 minutes and she went back home. She told me that she had to do something with her son, that she would come back over in a little while. I wanted to come over and spend time with her and her family and she told me that I was putting to much pressure on her. She doesn’t have a car nor do I so for her to go get food she would get a ride from a friend or she would Uber. I asked her twice if she wanted me to go with her because whenever she takes an Uber she usually wants me to go if I am here. Both times she said no and while she was gone I walked to the  gas station to get cigarettes. She told me before she left that she was getting her friend to take her, as I was walking back from the gas station she was getting out of an Uber. A little while later I confronted her about it and initially she said that her friend took her, but then I told her that I just saw her getting out of an Uber. She ended up telling me that she lied because she wanted space and didn’t want to hurt my feelings. I knew that she was going to get drugs, but I wanted to trust her.

Last night she came over and we hung out for a little while, and she pops her dose and falls asleep. I went through her phone once again, unfortunately, and found so many messages, her sending nude photos to friends for money, her lying to me about spending time with her dealer after she had sworn to me she wouldn’t ever again. Just sooo much deception! I’m utterly disgusted and heartbroken in so many ways. I know that I was wrong for going through her phone, but I had to know and I am not going to be played for a fool. 

After I confronted her about it, she gets violent once again. And screams at me that she can’t be committed and loyal to me because we can never have a future. We’ve spoken many times about our relationship, but when we both have deep feelings for one another, tell each other that we love you, take care of one another, it’s insanely hard to distinguish reality and a day dream. 

She’s not only the person that I’m in love with, but she was my best friend. And one of the worst parts is, that she’s right next door to me. It’s impossible to get away from one another or to not see her, let alone to forget about her. 

I’m lost, because I have invested so much energy into not only her, but her family. They are the closest thing I’ve had since I’ve lost my own.

baju1k,"Feeling helpless: adult niece back with abuser, do I report him to his new job?","MODS: If this is the wrong forum, please remove and let me know. This is a long story and I need some advice.

A little over one year ago, my niece began dating someone she met at work. Almost overnight after their first date, they were “engaged” and in a very serious relationship. Quickly, myself and other members of my large extended family received friend requests from him on social media. 

Soon, every post from my niece was about “I love my babe so much. Can’t wait to get married,” and every post from him was “I’m becoming a doctor some day, I’m making loads of money, I’m marrying the love of my life,” very over-the-top dramatic posts. (For context, my niece has never been much of a talker or someone who expresses themselves in such a manner.) The syntax in her posts was not her normal and much too similar to her boyfriend. 

Soon, he began text messaging me and others in the family, sending messages through messenger and following all of us on social media. I would also receive text messages from my niece but I knew it was actually him messaging me from her phone. Things continued to spiral out of control. 

He confessed to me that he had been “falsely” accused of rape out of the blue one day. I had not even met this man yet (I live in another state). This man later began sending friend requests to all of my brother’s and sister-in-law’s friends on Facebook as well. He is one of those people who posts 10 or more times per day. Very quickly I muted him. 

I confided to my sister-in-law how bizarre I thought his posts and behavior online, especially when he would post something about how “successful” he was and then 20 minutes later a picture of a very scantily clad woman the next. 

I also observed images of my niece who seemed to change immediately. She looked awful. She gained a lot of weight. Her clothes looked dirty. She stopped taking care of herself. Yet “she” was posting things about how amazing her life and this man was. 

Also at the same time, they were cycling through dogs. They would get a dog, then another dog, then give one of the dogs away and adopted a mutt puppy, then the puppy was too much, and on and on. 

On social, his posts grew out of hand. They were very up and down about how he is blissfully happy one moment and suicidal the next. 

Everything came to a head very soon. It turned out that over the past several months, police had been called to their apartment multiple times for suspected domestic violence. Each time something happened, my niece would take off in her car and refuse to file charges. My sister-in-law felt helpless because the boyfriend would not let my niece see her parents without him. After month of this behavior, my brother and sister-in-law decided to confront them both, saying they would not support their wedding, that they were concerned for my niece’s safety. 

During this confrontation, the boyfriend admitted to heavy drug use and having bipolar and other issues, which we already knew or suspected. Later that night, my niece called home in tears and the boyfriend could be heard in a rage. My brother ran over there, took my niece home and the latest dog she had. But a few days later she went back. 

Shortly thereafter, she came home from work to find the boyfriend in bed with another woman. She slapped him on the face and he called the police. She was arrested for assault. 

She was booked and later released after my brother bailed her out. A judge granted them 30 minutes to move whatever they could out of the house. She moved back home and with time things began to improve. The boyfriend got kicked out of college and he moved back to his home state. My niece began hanging with some girls and saving money again. 

But then, seemingly out of the blue, two weeks ago she up and left. She told us she moved out with some girls to another state, but it was a lie. She was back with him. She changed her number. She won’t respond to her parents and it is breaking our hearts. I’ve searched her boyfriend’s name on all social media and there are screen shots of messages he has sent people making threats of violence and murder. 

He is psychotic and has serious mental issues and my niece is being physically and mentally abused and manipulated by this man. But she is an adult. She has moved to another state. There is nothing we can do now. My brother and sister-in-law have explored every option, filed every kind of police report. But at the end of the day, she willingly up and left. Turns out, she had been secretly communicating with him the whole time. It was all a lie. 

Despite being blocked by both of them on social media, I was able to track down a lot of info about him. I have screen shots of his posts threatening someone, brandishing a gun, etc.

But my question to you is... should I file an anonymous complaint to his new employer? He has serious mental issues. He has made threats to people online. He has claimed to shoot someone and have gotten away with it online. Shouldn’t his new employer know? I may not be able to get my niece back, but I can at least make it so he can’t get a job working in the healthcare community. Shouldn’t I do this for the safety of the elderly and sick individuals he is working around?

What are our options at this point? We feel our hands are tied. I have this information that I know his employer would likely not have hired him if they knew about the threats he made and all the domestic violence calls from police. What would you go in this situation? I know it could make things worse for my niece though...",porcelina85,2019-04-07 12:07:39,0,1046,45.42,89.46,25.84,11.98,13.95,15.97,92.07,56.41,19.31,14.34,5.16,0.76,0.19,6.79,1.43,4.97,4.97,13.29,8.22,5.07,6.88,1.34,15.87,3.73,1.53,1.15,0.96,3.15,4.02,1.43,2.49,0.38,1.15,0.29,20.75,3.44,1.15,5.64,4.97,10.8,2.29,1.53,1.63,2.39,1.24,2.68,1.91,0.96,0.29,0.67,1.82,0.57,0.76,0.1,0.19,10.71,5.26,1.05,3.15,1.05,0.86,7.36,6.41,1.05,15.39,2.77,6.12,7.17,1.91,0.67,1.15,0.29,0.1,0.19,0.1,0,0,0,0.1,0,15.49,6.98,3.82,0.19,0,0.57,0,1.15,1.15,1.24,0.38,0

baosye,Wanting to apologize to everyone.,"I sincerely hope I don’t upset too many people for posting this here but I am completely lost.

I was with my ex GF for 3 and a half years in which we also shared an apartment. In my opinion it was the happiest time of my life. Throughout the 3 years, there was never an instance of domestic violence, nothing verbal, nothing physical, in fact I’ve never said any unkind words to her, ever. She was truly the absolute love of my life and she at one point said the same. As much as it pains me to say, eventually she changed. She would get easily upset, and didn’t enjoy being intimate with me later in our relationship. She was depressed because of a very unstable relationship with her mother, and she was fearful of her father whom she didn’t have a relationship with because of a restraining order she has on him. I’d often beg her for affection, and it just felt forced. At this point there was infidelity on her part in a big lack of trust mine. It was an emotional thing she had with another man. I didn’t realize it at the time but it really affected my self esteem. 
Our last day together I proposed to her, she said no and broke up with me on the spot. This was 5 months ago.

I took the break up hard. Very very very hard. I kept trying to see her, went to her job, tried to make sense of things but she didn’t want anything to do with me anymore. I also found out through a friend she made a tinder profile just two weeks after she broke things off with me, I had an emotional breakdown and voluntarily put myself in a hospital. After four days in the hospital, I still kept trying to contact my ex. I was an absolute wreck. Again, never said anything unkind or mean. After having multiple people tell me not to contact her, It ended in a restraining order and me serving two nights in a county jail and charged with 4th degree stalking. Today I am involved in a PTI program to clear everything up. She’s 23 and I’m 30.

Every morning I wake up and I look at myself in mirror in disappointment and disgust. Someone whom I loved sooooo much, whom I supported so much, now fears me. I put her in a terrible position and not a moment goes by that I don’t regret it. So I’m here to say to all of you, I am soo so so sorry for any abuse you have gone through. My ex fears me, I couldn’t even imagine the pain many of you have suffered. I wish you all so much love and support. I’m sorry",LAmeltdown,2019-04-07 20:22:41,0,474,39.47,53.38,52.05,4.44,14.81,14.77,93.67,61.18,21.94,16.46,9.7,0.63,0.84,5.27,0,5.49,5.7,15.19,7.59,6.75,6.12,3.16,16.46,4.85,1.69,0.84,2.11,2.95,8.02,2.95,5.06,1.05,0.21,1.9,14.56,0.42,0.84,5.49,0.63,12.24,1.27,1.48,1.69,2.32,3.59,2.32,3.16,0.63,1.27,1.05,2.32,0.21,1.48,0,0,6.54,2.74,0.84,2.11,0.42,0.42,8.23,6.75,0.63,14.98,1.27,6.75,6.33,0.42,0,0.42,0,0,0,1.05,0,0.42,0,0,0,13.5,6.54,4.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.74,0,0
bard8c,"I got a death threat for dating an old friend, and she might be in danger. Should I encourage her?","Fellow redditors,


Last month I (27,M) got in touch again with an old friend (26,F) from elementary school that I hadn't seen for a long long time. She is really innocent, soft, cute, adorable and really really hot. We started talking and I found out that she was a mother of 2 little kids, and had broken up with their father more than 1 year ago. Since she was single and really really hot, I kept it going and soon we started flirting over whatsapp and eventually meet up a couple of times in some neutral location to have some wild sex and a good talk. We agreed that we won't be together or anything, since I will leave the country next year and she doesn't really want to be in a relationship because of the children, thing that I completely understand. 

Everything was going smoothly until her ex found out (he went over her phone without her consent), then he called me and told me that she was his woman, and I was going to pay it, that he was going to kill me for it but before that  he was going to send some guy to cut my legs off. Then he sent my (very sexual) conversation with my friend to my mother, her mother, father and brother, among other people.

My mother didn't mind, and encouraged me to call my lawyer and go to the police, things that I did. The real problem is this that my friend never told me that her ex was really really violent with her and her family, including his children. They don't seem to consider the situation as severe as I do, since he told my friend that she was a fucking whore, that he would take the children away from her and that he would sue her for infidelity (seriously, they werent married and they broke up because my friend found out that he was going out with prostitutes and other women, and he even has another woman pregnant right now). 
Her family is doing nothing about it, the father even hang out with him to do some cocaine (!) every now and then. The brother is really worried, but I don't know if he can do something, and the mother is completely terrified about my friend's ex. 

My friend begged me for forgiveness, and she has barely talked to me since this happened (a few days ago). I told her that I have nothing to forgive her for, since she did nothing wrong, it is her ex who is a really sick and patriarchal guy that needs to be stopped. 

So, my dilemma right now is not about this guy trying to kill me (I don't really care, and don't really think that he will do it, would have done it already if he were serious) but about what should I do with my friend. She is really really scared, so scared, to the point of not beeing able to do anything about the situation, she is not able to go to the police or anything, since he has beeing brainwashing her for several years now. 

I know that she is really into me and she would listen to anything that I would say, so I could try to help her to open her eyes, but if I encourage her to stay away from him and to act, the situation could go out of control, ending up with him beating her, or the children, or something even worse, and I would hate myself for it.

What would you dear people do? 

P.S: I am sorry if there is any misspelled word or something like that, I am not from a native speaking english country.


TL;DR: my friend's abusive ex threatened me to kill me if I don't stop seen her, and she is too scared to keep him away from her life.

bb03q0,I was backhanded super hard by my girlfriend last night. Me [34 M] she [36 F] 6 year relationship,"Hey, I am reposting from r/relationships since my post was removed due to concern over expertise. I was referred here by the moderators.

This is a copy paste from the original post (including a TLDR) followed by an update at the bottom: 

*We were having a lovely evening whilst driving home, singing, laughing and talking when my girlfriend asked me to pull over the car to fix the headlight that had gone out. She was afraid that we'd be pulled over and get a ticket even though I was the one driving. I felt pretty unconcerned, was willing to chance it and responded, ""nah, we're ok,"" when she yelled my name in frustration and backhanded me so hard that my teeth clattered and my head rang. Its been over two hours and I can still feel where she hit me on my face.*

*She apologized right away and then started to yell at me about how I need to pull over in this mix of anger and fear in her voice. I was so immediately pissed that I veered the car over and slammed on the breaks, popped the hood and let her fix the light. I'm a mechanic but in that moment I was so shocked I just sat in the car and processed what happened while she fiddled with the plug.*

*When she got back in the car I started driving home again and I was just quiet for a long, long time. She sat in the passenger seat and tried to apologize and I cut her off and just lapsed into silence. She fiddled with her thumbs for a long time and looked out the window. I was overcome with a sense of compassion and empathy to immediately forgive her because I hated feeling her feel so bad. However, I resisted the urge and stewed until I formed to words to tell her (more or less) in a flat, angry tone:*

*""There are millions of men in the world that would have clocked you right then and there (I had no such impulse). I am overwhelmed with a desire to forgive you because I feel so much empathy for you right now and it dawns on me how f\*cked up that impulse actually is. I'm so empathetic because I grew up in an abusive home and it became a survival mechanism over the years in order to avoid getting a beating. If our roles were reversed, I am 100% convinced that I would be walking home right now and we would have been immediately broken up. Whatever apology you have to say or comments to make, imagine our roles were reversed and pretend they were coming out of my mouth and see how all that sounds out loud.""*

*She was quiet and said that I was right, and she would 100% understand if I wanted to break up with her right there. That anything she said would sound like what an abusive boyfriend or husband would say in that situation. She said that she gets frustrated with me a lot lately when I blow things off and that she didn't mean to hit me, it just happened. She promised never to do it again and doesn't expect me to forgive her.*

*All I told her was that I knew she was sorry, that no one was breaking up tonight and that I need to be mad about this for awhile. We haven't spoken since we got home.*

*I have no idea if I handled this right. How should I proceed from here? What further information do you need?*

***TLDR My girlfriend backhanded me super hard and I don't know what to do about it even after the apology***

&amp;#x200B;

This is the update:

Since last night, I've been distant from my girlfriend (we live in the same house). Last night she came over when I was on my computer and kissed my cheek telling me she was sorry again and asked if I was coming to bed. I told her I wasn't right away and simply said goodnight. I lost a lot of sleep last night because I had this horrible pit in my stomach from what happened so this morning I slept through my alarm and she woke me up 10 minutes before I had to leave for work and in my panic rush I was really short with her. I feel bad about this because she's not responsible for me getting to work on time and I guess my feelings about last night carried over, so it wasn't fair for me to be mad at her over that but that's what happened. 

There was a lot of helpful insight in the /relationships but I think I owe it to myself to get your perspectives before moving on to whatever I decide about the fate of my relationship. A recurring question appeared in those comments with regards to the pattern of behaviors, so I will preemptively say here that while my girlfriend has never hit me before she has been highly critical towards me in private and in front of others about my perceived shortcomings to the point that its made people uncomfortable. We've argued about that in the past. Typically its about my general messy, chaotic nature and while I try to acquiesce to her frustrations in order to create a more harmonious home I often feel that I'm never really accepted 100% as living up to her demands for me to be a better, cleaner, more productive person (i do have lazy tendencies). We've been having problems lately regarding some unresolved issues about our future and me going back to school. We've tried and failed to talk about that stuff and I guess things just boiled over.

bb1f0o,Indecisive,"I'm not sure if this makes sense, but does anyone else feel miserable with and without them? Without them, I'm constantly obsessing what he is doing, who with, missing him, crying,etc. With him, when the cold shoulder and anger starts again during arguments, I just wish they would break up with me and I'd be free.  I sometimes wonder if I'm the toxic one, when you put all the bad memories together of course it paints them in a bad light. So I wonder if I'm the problem? But then I remember the emotional roller coaster ride of hot/cold whether they know what they are doing or not, still hurts. I obsess wondering if he is a narcissist or just narcisstic traits due to a terrible childhood/family, or rage disorder, drug abuse, or just much needed childhood counseling he never got. Idk why, Maybe it will help explain the hot/cold. My sister always said I want what I can't have. After everything he has done, I sometimes want him to pay but deep down I could never wish him ill because I love them.  But again part happy/miserable with and without them. Can't escape.

bb267e,“An abuser almost never does anything that he himself considers morally unacceptable.”,"‘He may hide what he does because he thinks other people would disagree with it, but he feels justified inside. I can’t remember a client ever having said to me: “There’s no way I can defend what I did. It was just totally wrong.” He invariably has a reason that he considers good enough. In short, an abuser’s core problem is that he has a distorted sense of right and wrong. I sometimes ask my clients the following question: “How many of you have ever felt angry enough at your mother to get the urge to call her a bitch?” Typically, half or more of the group members raise their hands. Then I ask, “How many of you have ever acted on that urge?” All the hands fly down, and the men cast appalled gazes on me, as if I had just asked whether they sell drugs outside elementary schools. So then I ask, “Well, why haven’t you?” The same answer shoots out from the men each time I do this exercise: “But you can’t treat your mother like that, no matter how angry you are! You just don’t do that!”’

bb4z99,I (M36) filed for a restraining order today against partner (F33) after three years but have so many what ifs and what have I done moments now.,"I woke up this morning thinking we were back to living apart, taking space and working on ourselves because we loved each other and wanted to stick together no matter what because we could be so beautiful and have such incredible fun together and make passionate love and collaborate on projects, art, events, adventures and dream together and cry together. I was told that you texted my mother you were getting a restraining order against me. I don’t think i deserve a restraining order for or our last bout. You’ve aggressed me physically when you’re mad enough for years and I’ve always been able to be the big furry lab that lets the little puppy nip at them while staying cool. You’ve never injured me and I’ve never injured you defending myself, until recently. I know I could always look like the asshole and always risk going to jail every time we’ve fought in front of the kids until you landed a finger in my eye and went to jail for it a couple months ago. You said me feeling safe again was important to you, then two nights ago you said you didn’t know what I meant by my safety being infringed upon was a deal breaker for me and you said you didn’t want to hear it and it wasn’t important to you anymore because you were mad again and so I tried to leave and you hit me in the eye with a finger punch and I pushed you back and hurt you in the process. You told my mother that after tripping and falling you may have broken a rib and that we did damage to the rental property. I fled to my car and locked it. You kicked the door hard and dented it. Your rib probably stopped you from kicking it again even though you said you would put another dent in my car. You relented, I still slept in the cold car. We said don’t call me and then started texting me because you didn’t know who else to call. I blocked you and haven’t answered. Today I filed and got signed a temporary restraining order because after I told my legalese parents that I didn’t care if you got a restraining order against me (you told them you were this morning) because I don’t plan on being in the same park and not being able to turn around and leave. If I run into you at the mall I can leave, there is nowhere like a shared day care or anything I need access to and so I said I would just accept you doing that to me and that I would only want to get one against you if things escalated from here. I said I wanted to take responsibility for the cabin and getting the car repaired and apologize for hurting you just in the hopes of getting this behind us. They said I’ve been foolish about letting the law bite me and that if it is the case that I was acting out of self defense backed into a corner pleading for my safety I wasn’t going to make things better for myself by lying. So I filed the order being as truthful as I could. I was told it was good and “fair.” I got the pressure to act now because today you were filing at 10. I got the form from the courthouse at 10:30. By 1:30 a judge was willing to sign it and give us a court date of two weeks from now. I woke up thinking we were going to beat the odds because we had so much glue and spontaneous compatibility that we would keep trying even in the dark. Now I’m wondering what I’ve done. Where is my shoulder to cry on? Where’s my muse, my fire that hurls herself into Christmas and parties and late night trips to target and the grocery store? Where is the most beautiful body and face and Instagram smile that I never dreamed of for myself or knew I could partner with for so long? Why couldn’t you already be healed from your past and not confusing it with me still? Why did I wait so long to walk away from the ugliness that our friends and family grew tired of forgiving us for? How permanent is this? 90 days, a year? What if we get better? What if we heal? Do I have to stop being in awe of your strengths or your imperfections or your desperation to be with me that frightens the hell out of you when you tell me to leave and then realize you are truly alone and you’re terrified of being an underpaid talent with kids with special needs who doesn’t have any friends or family to rely on tonight. Did you get served today? Will it be tomorrow you learn what I’ve done? Did it spark so many tears and wailing? Have you been kind and trying to spoil the children? Did you think about putting sugar in my gas tank? The first moment we met I knew you were fire and I would grab the bull by it’s horns until I couldn’t hold on anymore. I was grateful to you that we made it three weeks before you dumped me the first time and I cried. Now, I don’t cry anymore going on three years. I’ve been left for good so many times I don’t think it’s real. I think it’s time to walk away this time for real and start to grieve in earnest. I’m so much sadder than I’m ready to let anyone know but you. Everyone else thinks I’m a decent guy with a well rounded head on my shoulder who can’t wait to be better off. They can’t imagine that I put all my best into treating you like a queen whether you deserved it or not and I really really enjoyed loving you and adoring you and I wasn’t keeping score and today it’s over-over. There is no happy ending to this story. We don’t stay waiting for each other, we don’t win stable lives with stable jobs and stable health and a recovery of mental health and time and patience and a whole family again. You’re family will never forgive me and mine will not forgive you and nothing about our glue is going to fix this. It’s fucked. The cosmos have laughed at our idea of standing in love. We just fell slower and longer and deeper than before. And now this really really hurts that you hurt me so much and I don’t care I just miss your warmth.",birdzcharlie,2019-04-09 00:24:03,1,1149,19.68,70.24,89.82,58.7,20.52,12.27,91.99,60.84,22.02,16.28,8.36,2.18,5.31,0.09,0.35,5.74,4.53,12.45,9.83,5.31,9.83,2.87,20.71,3.57,1.91,1.74,1.22,1.31,7.4,4.53,2.79,0.52,0.7,1.13,13.32,0.61,0.52,0.35,0.09,11.05,2.18,1.22,2.09,2.18,1.22,4,2.7,0.52,0.87,1.22,2.61,1.31,0.87,0.17,0.17,9.75,4.26,1.48,2,2,0.78,7.31,9.75,1.31,16.28,2.79,5.74,7.66,0.78,0.96,0.52,0.26,0.17,0.09,0.44,0.26,0,0.09,0.09,0,10.62,3.66,1.04,0.17,0,1.22,0,0.09,0.17,3.74,0.52,0

bb8y2p,After 13 years of marriage my husband has become Abusive.,"My husband and I have been married for 13 years. The last 6 months of our marriage has been rough. We argue more than ever and in the last 60 days he has hit me twice. The first time he struck me in the head and then the second time he hit me in the arm leaving a very noticeable bruise. The last 13 years of marriage have been great, We have two healthy children, a beautiful home, wonderful friends and it was a beautiful life. But the last 6 month he has turned into something I have never seen before. He is drinking more and so argumentative. He is a self-employed farmer, and we have a trucking business on the side. Lately on the farming side of this he is maxed out and is worried about bankruptcy. He has farmed since High School and loves it, But times are tough and I think the stress financially plays a huge impact on why he's changed. The first time he hit me he promised he would never ever do it again and was so ashamed of himself and the second time I haven't been able to forgive him this time. I haven't told him that, but I am really struggling this time with it.
  Last year I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder that is not life treating but I have to manage for the rest of my life. It has affected me mentally, so I have been more argumentative and I'm trying my best to stop but I am still working with my doctors getting me on the right meds. I don't know what to do. I am so lost right now, and don't know where to turn. My husband is a great man and has been a great father and provider for us . He is involved on several boards and does a lot of things in our community. I have told no one about this. I am so embarrassed and ashamed. I work outside the home 6 days a week and am even struggling to concentrate at work. I married him when I was young (22) and he was (33). I don't know where to turn I love my life, my kids and him but this last time has really taken a toll on me and I can't seem to get past it. I think what really upset me is when my mom saw my arm and asked what happened and I lied to her. After my father passed away when I was a baby my mother was physically abused by my step father and watching that as a small child was terrifying. All those scary moments as a kid are all now coming back. I'm not here wanting pity, I just want to know what I can do to feel better. Sorry So long I just haven't unloaded any of this on anybody and I think it would help me talk about it. Can this be corrected ? Can we still have a happy normal marriage after this?",Millie090,2019-04-09 07:59:56,0,520,18.2,43.89,83.03,15.03,16.77,11.92,94.62,61.54,20.19,15,9.81,1.35,0,3.85,0,5.19,6.15,10.19,12.69,6.54,8.27,2.31,19.04,5.96,2.31,1.92,3.08,1.54,6.73,2.88,3.65,1.92,1.15,0.58,12.31,2.88,0.19,0.58,5,9.62,2.5,0.77,0.77,1.15,1.54,3.08,1.35,0.96,0,0.38,2.5,0.58,1.35,0,0.19,9.81,4.04,1.92,2.88,1.54,0.19,5.38,13.46,0.38,15.96,1.54,5.19,9.42,1.92,0.38,0.38,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.77,5.58,1.92,0,0,0.38,0,0.19,0,1.92,0.77,0
bbez6m,Moments of Weakness and Fake Profiles,"So he created a fake facebook account to message me.  And I’m ashamed to say that I messaged him back, briefly, for a few days until his unrepenting narcissism shone through. I eventually realised he hadn’t learned anything from this whole experience other than to pity himself more.

 Yawn.  Blocked.  

But it did make me start to wonder why it was that we give these assholes so many second chances, when they’ve done things that are so reprehensible. 

Normally in a relationship that ends, I can happily bounce off with a “wish you the best” or a “fuck you, I deserve better” depending on the circumstances. But with this guy, it’s so hard to untangle myself from it.  

Then I realised that it’s in part ego, in part how human’s as a whole learn to function with each other, and a huge heaping of needing to forgive to heal. I think I’m going to address each of these separately. 

EGO 
The most basic one.  The most annoying one.  
I feel I deserve some form of justice.  Not in the “I want him miserable and broken in my wake” (which if I were to believe his messages, was exactly what he was trying to convey.  Just with an obnoxious overlay of “me, me, me” rather than taking any time to genuinely care about my well-being.  

My ego demanded that I wanted him to display a shred of actual genuine empathy.  You know, the empathy that my friends and family have shown my unceasingly since I left.  The sort of concern and desire to make sure that my mental well-being is ok, that I’m coping, that I’m being looked after. 

But I’m not going to get it from him.  I know I’d get it from another human being. Sigh.  

As the mantra goes, never feed the narcissist. 

HUMAN FUNCTIONING 
This is quite important for all of us to recognize on this subreddit, I think.  Human’s are inherently social creatures.  We try to overlook the flaws in the people to which we’ve bonded. We try to help others.  We do have empathy and try to understand where they’re coming from. 


And goddammit, I’m a naïve optimist that likes to see the best in people, trust them, and encourage them to better themselves.  And personally I think that makes me a wonderful person. 


So when someone we’ve bonded to, especially through traumatic cycles, does this, it becomes an almost personal quest to save them from themselves. 


Well fuck that.  

I am very proud of my ability to love and support people.  But now I’m letting self-respect take the reigns, with a little angel on my shoulder snapping her fingers in z-formation, and crying out “you go girl!”

I still have the urge for things to return to my carefully crafted alternate reality. 
But while I fight my urge, I can honestly say I am not willing to risk my wellbeing over this anymore. 
  
That ship has sailed for him.  I intend to look after the others who deserve my love and respect and who will show me the same in turn. 

NEEDING TO FORGIVE TO HEAL
We always forget the one vital part of this… forgiving the trauma, does not mean forgiving the act.  In my mind abuse is an unforgivable act.  But when we forgive the trauma and learn to let it go, we often forget to do what every other normal person does in a break up.  We need to sever those bonds. We need to mourn the relationship and recognise that it's not as shiny as we remember. 

Its not just about ‘letting it go’ because there are some invaluable life lessons to be taken away from it.  Its been extraordinary to learn my own strength and resilience and well as my weaknesses.  

Reflection, sharing, and research have all helped me grow a great deal since my escape. 

But as we reflect, and daresay learn to empathise with our abuser (a step I am not yet quite ready to take ... but I am sure that I will, and I eagerly await the day that apprehension is replaced by pity, when fear is replaced with indifference, when longing for better times is replaced with new memories of better people; I know I am not at this stage yet.  And that’s ok.  I’m focusing on me. Not him.) we often fall into the trap of forgetting that the abuse occurred.  That it is indeed a hard line that was crossed.  Its when we become most vulnerable to getting suckered back in. 
So I am avoiding that particular step right now. 

But what I am starting to learn to do is focus on the minutia of things that, while not necessarily dealbreakers in love, really do show me that he wasn’t as great as I remember.  Because it got a bit black and white, Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde, angel and demon, in my brain.  The abuse was so overwhelming, that I almost separated it out from the person that he was.  

So occasionally, when I have a moment of weakness and get high on hopium for a change that I know won’t come, I reflect on all the good times.  I think to myself, if only the abuse was gone, he would be the ideal man!

Except, he wasn’t.  He was lazy about doing chores, rather selfish, far too obsessed with videogames, got too angry and personal about politics, never cooked, and didn’t do shit to look after me while I was sick.  

I definitely want better than that. My ideal partner would at least make an effort on some of those (I can count one one pinky the number of times he cooked for me in our final year together). 
And he didn’t give me the effort.   

I guess a vital step in the healing process is to mourn the relationship, mourn the future you had envisioned as dead (it was a pipedream anyway, let’s be real here), and maybe remember his human flaws as well as his monstrous ones.

bbf2iq,Domestic,"Hello

I am a Master’s graduate student in the Social Science Division at the University of Chicago. I am conducting a study on domestic violence and custody. The study consists of a 60-minute interview and there is a $25 compensation provided at the conclusion of the interview.

I am a 23-year-old woman. I was a hotline Counsellor at the Boston Area Rape Crisis Centre. The interview will end with a debrief and safety planning discussion in order to ensure that the interviewee will have the necessary tools for self-care and an infrastructure of support.

Interview participants must have children, whether biological or adopted. The relationship does not have to be recent and the violence experienced doesn’t need to be physical. There are no gender or sexuality requirements. I simply want to listen to your story. I hope this research can be used to influence how the legal systems and non-profit organisations can better help domestic violence survivors.

If you might be interested in taking part in the study please contact me at [lshanker@uchicago.edu](mailto:lshanker@uchicago.edu) or DM me. 

If you want to verify my identity you can DM me or email me an I will provide you with my LinkedIn profile.

I am a Master’s graduate student in the Social Science Division at the University of Chicago. I am conducting a study on domestic violence and custody. The study consists of a 60-minute interview and there is a $25 compensation provided at the conclusion of the interview.

I am a 23-year-old woman. I was a hotline Counsellor at the Boston Area Rape Crisis Centre. The interview will end with a debrief and safety planning discussion in order to ensure that the interviewee will have the necessary tools for self-care and an infrastructure of support.

Interview participants must have children, whether biological or adopted. The relationship does not have to be recent and the violence experienced doesn’t need to be physical. There are no gender or sexuality requirements. I simply want to listen to your story. I hope this research can be used to influence how the legal systems and non-profit organisations can better help domestic violence survivors.

If you might be interested in taking part in the study please contact me at [lshanker@uchicago.edu](mailto:lshanker@uchicago.edu)or DM me.

If you want to verify my identity you can DM me or email me an I will provide you with my LinkedIn profile.

bbfvr3,"Divorce, now child custody with an abusive ex","( genders may or may not have been changed to protect myself)
In a nutshell. I have a history of DV between my ex husband and my daughter. It’s documented. We were together and married but never really lived together. My ex mother in law and I have major problems as well. (That’s another story, and it was handled by police, but she violated that) I moved across the country to get away and divorced her. He barely reached out. Maybe once every five months. Marriage settlement was in place. He broke it a few times. He saw her a few years ago and mentally and physically abused her. His mother came along too and she wasn’t supposed to and abused her as well.
Out of no where they got a lawyer and all of a sudden he calls every day and is the picture perfect father. It’s been over a year in court and it’s been horrible. A lot of other horrible things have been done by him and his mom. Constant changing of petitions and stories on his part. And lot and lots of lies. I have proof to these lies but I haven’t been able to tell my story in court. All we want is supervised visitation to keep her safe. The other party wants unsupervised visits a few hours away.
Does anyone have any advice on how to go about getting supervised visits. A lot more stuff has happened between him and I and my daughter. Which include alcohol, and weapons. I moved away to keep her and myself safe.

bbie6w,Domestic violence victim in hiding,"I pray for my safety, this thread does not go viral.  Please, people, this obviously is not your life that could be in danger, but treat sensitivity as if it were.  I am a victim of domestic violence who lives hidden from my abuser.  They physically abused me (kicked me, punched me, stabbed me, raped me, etc.), emotionally and mentally and even financially.  I ""woke up"" when I became pregnant with my abuser and ran to the hills before giving birth.  My abuser never knew the sex of the baby, the name, the date of birth, etc.  I sincerely believe that if he discovered it or found us, it would end up like all the news articles that we have seen circulating lately.  Shot and killed during a custody exchange or killed before one was put in place.  It's better for my baby and my safety, he's never involved and he does not know.  I say all that to ask ... if I declare my taxes this year ... and claim my newborn baby as a dependent, is there any way he can find out I had the baby?  I ask because his step brother has a friend who works for the IRS and also a cousin who works for H &amp; R Block ... my fear is that, after filing my tax, if I include my dependent, the stepbrother or cousin might be monitoring my  information (I left behind a copy of my social information) and then they would have my information to help my ex find me.

I had given him years of chances and opportunities to change course and of course in the end his addiction and narcissism overwhelmed him. I am sitting here alone, since he isolated me from almost all of my friends and my family is hours away. He has cut all communication with me after I dared ask him not to drink in my home. And I am so furious and lonely and disgusted at what a selfish pig he is. And all I want is for him to txt me and acknowledge my fathers death. After almost 4 years it seems so cold that he can just walk away. But I guess that is evidence of how little any of it meant to him.

bbuyqp,I am back again and things are worse,"I left him almost two years ago. I moved back home with my parents and enrolled in school, I made it into the honors college, then six months later I went back to him. He promised me that things would be different, we finally got engaged and now things are worse then ever. While I was gone he was seeing his ex while pretending to be working things out with me. He lied about it until I eventually found a photo of them together that he couldn't explain away. When I confronted him about it he pushed me into a wall so hard that I couldn't move my arm for a week. Before I left him the abuse was mostly verbal, now it's much more physical. He took my phone from me one day and threw it into the lake behind our house because I didn't make his toast the way he likes it. I had a project for school and he got angry one night and threatened to delete all of my files. He broke my laptop twice, the last time he broke it he threw it so hard that it made gauges in the hardwood floor. He slammed a door on my hand, my palm was black from bruising for several days, he cut my foot open when he slammed the door on it a different time. He locked me out of the house in only my underwear and a t-shirt shirt. He locked me out another time in only my pyjamas. I don't know why I'm here still. I don't know why I keep coming back to this.

bbvgrl,I (27F) decided I'm leaving my abuser tomorrow. I'm absolutely terrified,"***long post, sorry** Long time listener, first time caller. I have been in a relationship for 6 years with a man I've known since we were 13 years old. He was part of my wider social group growing up, and not long after he came out of a long term relationship aged 21, we started dating. We have lived together for 3.5 years, no children. He has a major weed problem too and spends £300/month minimum on the stuff. I couldn't possibly list all the shit he's done over the years, I'd be here forever. But it all started unravelling when I found out 2 years ago he cheated on me early in the relationship. The start of a steep decline. 

Over the past 2 years, I've suffered horribly with depressive episodes so bad that I haven't been able to work for around half of that time. I don't have the strength nor the motivation to get out of  bed most days. The best part of this is, he has been physically, emotionally and psychologically abusive to me since Day 1 (didn't escalate to physical until around 2yrs in) meanwhile I have been thinking I am going bat shit insane. I mean I actually thought there was a strong possibility I was borderline/bipolar and was planning to discuss my concerns with my doctor in a couple of weeks.

I realised tonight after having a long talk and confessing everything (and I mean EVERYTHING)  to my sister that I have been consistently gaslighted. But to the extent that I was honestly convinced for a while that i had serious psychological disorders. My sister basically reassured me that the recent episodes ive been experiencing are in fact perfectly normal human reactions to trauma. She was really fucking angry and basically told me she hates him, my 2 remaining friends hate him, my family hate him. That he cuts me off from everyone, isolates me. Any time I leave the house he always has an issue with it - no matter where or for how long. He calls me obsessively. He has worn me down so, so much that I'm now a shell of the person I used to be. How could I have let this happen? I felt really saddened that my family were afraid to tell me how they felt about him, in case I reacted badly and they lost me forever. 

I love him more than anything on earth. But he is a broken person. I've called him out on the abuse a hundred times - he denies he is abusive 100% of the time and tells me to stop 'playing the victim'. I hung around for a long time, talking myself back into it, hoping things would change. And for a very short time, they did. Until it started again. 

I hit rock bottom so deep that on Monday night I walked out of the house with the full intent that I was going to drink myself into oblivion in the street, or jump off a bridge - or both. But not once did I think of leaving my relationship - a fate worse than death. I'm honestly shocked at how fucked up I actually am because of this. 

I walked out of the house, telling him I needed to take a walk to clear my head. I didnt dare tell him my plans. He basically made me feel horribly guilty about not being able to work and I decided I was a useless, worthless POS and didn't deserve to live. He shouted after me as I walked out the door. 

By the time I got 2mins down the road, I had 7 missed calls. I went to the supermarket, bought a bottle of red wine and went to the local park, where I sat on the bench swigging the bottle and crying because I felt like i had nowhere else to go. I started thinking of perhaps running out in front of a car, or jumping from the railway bridge. My partner went out looking for me in the streets,  found me after a short time (the park isn't far from our house) and ordered me to go home. 

After I got there I was still screaming I was going to kill myself because it hurt too much to carry on. That I felt like nothing. I didn't deserve happiness. That I can do nothing right no matter how hard I try. He said he was going to call the police to have me sectioned - and I begged him not to. The only reason he let up was because I told him if he did, they'd keep me in the hospital for minimum 2 days and drug me up to the eyeballs - and who would wash his clothes and cook his dinners then? 

I plan on breaking up with him tomorrow. I don't know where I'll go. Part of me is scared that he might try revenge porn, or that breaking up with him will make me suicidal again, and might just tip me over the edge enough to actually do it. 

It'd be easier to stay. I'm just totally lost. I feel like I don't even know myself. How do I cope with this horrible feeling? Do I tell my workplace about what's been going on, seeing as I have now been absent the past 3 months? I don't know where to turn. 

Sorry I am just venting. It's been a night filled with difficult truths and emotions.

bbzv9q,Questions i needed answers to,"It's my first time posting so forgive me (and remind me) if I make any mistakes. Today me and my mom had an argument. We never argue much so this is rare. 

It started of with me and my mom discussing about her brother aka my uncle. I might have offended her by implying my uncle is being quite a douche for having a ""more than friends"" relationship with another lady. She got mildly upset, I can tell by the way she's shifting in her seat but I still continue my thoughts. I didn't meant to upset her but things get heated. She raised her voice to pause me from talking, she did that caz I'm rambling and my thoughts aren't whole. So whenever she wanted to speak I happened to say something at the same time. The raise of voice caught me off guard. So instead of continuing the topic I asked her why did she yell at me. 

We started talking louder and she got angrier. She then decided to grab a broom and proceed towards me. Me, seeing her marching towards me with a broom in hand clearly wanting to hit me with it, threw a remote control at her and which she blocked by raising her arms. She then swung the broom at me (aiming at my torso and not the head) while I kinda kicked. To clarify I didn't do the karate kick/ high kick, I kinda did the stomp kick (imagine kicking down a door). She landed 2 hits on my wrist and knee while I also landed a couple. 

After the whole action scene we yelled at each other a whole lot. Dad soon came down to keep things under control. And we calmed down. They told me no matter what I shouldn't raise my hand against my mother under any circumstances. I was baffled my this. My thoughts were: so she can whip me to death and she would still be right?

That's why I'm here to ask for opinions. I have two questions: 1) Am I the asshole for hitting her? 2) Is my dad right about not ever hitting back?

bc3al9,Finally free,"This whole relationship has been a nightmare Idk why I didn't listen to all the red flags. Initially we met hung out for a month and he was already trying to control me and screamed at me often. I broke up with him and a month later we started talking again after he apologized. ( so stupid)  he had moved a state away and we had a long distance relationship over the summer but I saw him a few times a month (right after seeing him I'd look forward to having space from him again.)  During my visits he became more explosive and now I realize he was being sexually abusive as well. He would manipulate me into doing things I didn't want to do and make it seem like if I didn't he would get it somewhere else. He'd degrade me by calling me names and call me retard. As the end of summer was near and I was preparing to go back to school to finish my last semester, I thought we would probably just break up. He couldn't really be in my state because he had warrants(and a record so long that it takes 8 pages to print it all off) but  after screaming at me on the phone after getting wasted because he had a ""bad day"" he started threatening suicide untill I had to drop everything and drive an hour to go be with him. Once I was there he seemed totally fine and wanted to coerce me into anal sex like nothing had happened. The next day he was in a good mood joking and laughing like nothing happened. When I brought it up he started freaking out at me saying I was nit picking him and how he already felt bad enough. I asked him why he didn't apologize and he said because I was the reason he had a fit of rage. He went on to buy me gift's that day and try to make things fun again. We drove to one of my favorite places in Oregon to get some of his things on the way back he asked me to drive and would constantly critique how I was driving than screamed at me to pull over and cursed at me for making him drive. Once we got back to my car he said he was done with me and to fuck off. I drove back to my house and ignored his phone calls. Stupidly I finally picked up instead of apologizing he just asked what I wanted to do and sort of told me what I wanted to hear then asked of he could stay with me for a month and I said if he paid me rent he could. (Stupid stupid stupid choice wtf was I thinking?) That month turned into 5 and I only got 1 month of rent from him and he always had excuses why he shouldn't have to pay such as all the trips he had paid for over the summer and how he kept my house clean. When that stopped working with me and I told him to gtf out he resorted to lying about $1500 of his cash savings getting stolen and how I was responsible because either me or one of my friends stole it.  There were nights where he would drunkenly rage  to the point of setting one of my carpets on fire (and denying he ever did it) and him screaming at me all night and then waking me up early  because he was shaking my bed to jerk off. This was my last semester of school and I barely passed my classes. He always was stressing me out. He hated how I could just leave the house  and escape his outrages and would accuse me of cheating when I left to escape him. He pressured me into doing things I didn't want to do often. He ruined my graduation because I didn't want my family to meet him so I didn't walk. I will forever hate him for that.

I had been planning to move to Portland for several years. I was thinking I'd move April 2019 and have a few months where I could work and save money.  The whole time he lived with me he didn't have a job because of his warrants and wasn't paying me rent so I spent a lot of money that was supposed to be for my move on paying bills. He tied our finances together (never ever have a cash savings it's the dumbest thing ever) and all told me he wanted to leave the state to get away from his warrants. He wanted to move Jan 1 which was 2 weeks after I finished college. I had barely anytime to say good bye to friends or make arrangements to store my stuff which then ended up going in his storage unit so we could leave faster (HUGE mistake) we rented an air bnb on my credit card for a month $900 to find jobs and a more long term place to live. I was already planning my escape fron him. Thankfully Portland people are a lot less tolerant of watching men scream at their partners than in Idaho. The first night in Portland when I told him I didn't want to leave the hotel on new years eve because I was tired and my dog is deathly afraid of fire works he started raging at me and both neighbors called security. I was in a new place with no support system and that was ultimately his plan.  He had told me when I had sold my vehicle that I could use one of his anytime I wanted but I soon found out he was using this as leverage over me and threatened to call the police if I drove his vehicles. We looked at a lot of rooms for rent and I think other people could sense what an evil piece of shit he was but we finally found one and I was thankful to have a roommate because I knew he wouldn't act out as much. Everything had to be on his terms he would keep me up late and wake me up early he would threaten to let my dog loose by a busy road. I finally got recordings of his saying some horrific things and he claimed I made him look bad by asking baited questions. I had trouble keeping jobs from all the stress and he was still being lazy and not holding down jobs and instead hanging around the house all day. Thankfully 2 weeks ago he started drinking liquor again and couldn't hold in his crazy like he usually could around other people. I was not feeding in to his moping and when he tried to trigger me I would just shrug at him and kept playing on my phone. Finally he exploded at my friend and I and luckily my roommate got home to see it. My ex stormed out saying he'd move out the next day. My roommate told me after he was planning on giving his 30 day notice if my ex was going to stick around because he was so toxic. 

3 days later I started getting texts from my ex about how much he missed me and how he would help me get my things out of his storage unit and tried to be cute and loving. As soon as my responses to him became fewer he started freaking out and told me I'd never see my stuff again. At this point he's threatened that so many times as a way to control me that I would just rather never see him again and not be forced to talk to him again. I hate him so much and want revenge. He has fucked up my life so much. I'm so glad he's gone but I live in fear about him retaliating in some way he knows where I live and work and he didn't leave the house key when he left so I sleep with my bedroom door locked and told all the neighbors he's not supposed to be there. I feel like I have severe ptsd from him  my hate for him grows stronger by the day. I can't believe I was dumb enough to let him in my life despite the red flags and all my friends hating him. Any advice on recovering from this shit storm would be awesome. I have no romantic feelings for him and he will never be in my life again. It seriously feels like I survived a massive battle but came out with life long gaping wounds.",Deadgirl1888,2019-04-11 11:24:28,6,1458,27.42,44.83,59.4,3.76,24.3,12.41,94.51,60.77,21.88,18.86,10.15,0.75,0,7.89,0.07,2.95,3.57,14.54,8.78,6.45,8.37,1.99,20.16,4.05,2.19,1.71,1.3,2.26,5.9,1.78,4.05,0.69,2.06,0.21,13.44,0.07,0.69,0,7.96,12.35,1.65,2.47,2.81,2.13,1.65,2.67,2.54,0.75,1.23,0.48,1.65,0.34,0.75,0.27,0.27,7.2,2.06,1.17,2.4,1.03,0.89,9.95,6.24,0.96,18.66,2.81,7.89,8.44,1.58,0.69,1.51,1.65,0,0.14,1.1,0.69,0.14,0.07,0.07,0.07,7.2,3.98,0.07,0,0,0.07,0,0,0.14,1.85,0.96,0.14

help me pay it forward for my girlfriend survivor and has experienced death of a child/domestic abuse

Apr 11
I will be surprising my other half for their bday with a mini vacay to T-dot. I need some info: Please help a small city idiot out:

what is considered central to downtown Ottawa?
whats the further-est area in tdot you would stay to be around all the buzz and commotion?
looking for air bnb private max 110 per night
3 to four nights
secret hidden toronto gems to see
memorable once ina lifetime experiences?
this trip has to be special. maybe some of you will be more eager to help me out or guide me to the right people who may when i explain to you why:

my other half, my heart…..is a survivor of severe domestic abuse and sexual…..her daughter was murdered in the process…..its been over four years and we are celebrating her life and our anniversary and our progression……..

this person is AMAZING, DEEP AND LONG TERM LOVE DOES BUT ONLY IF BOTH PUT IN A LOT OF WORK AND DEAL WITH PAIN AND SADNESS AT TIMES. I AM MAKING THE CHOICE TO BE WITH HIM BECAUSE I WANT TOO AND IT FEELS RIGHT. IT IS NOT EASY FOR ME NOR FOR HIM, BUT IT FEELS RIGHT. I KNOW WITHIN TIME THINGS WILL IMPROVE AND TIME IS A GREAT HEALER. IT SUCKS FOR BOTH OF US SOMETIMES, BUT WE KEEP DOING IT CAUSE IT WORTH DOING IT. THE PERFECT PARTNER DOES NOT EXIST AND THAT IS OKAY. WE FOUND EACH OTHER AND HAVE MANAGED TO MAKE IT THROUGH TEN MONTHS OF CHAOS BECAUSE AT THE CORE WE HAVE THE SAME SOULS: WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH HELL AND BACK, WE HAVE THE SAME VALUES AND WE KNOW THAT LIFE IS NOT EASY — HE IS SLOWLY TEACHING ME THAT LIFE IS FULL OF MEANING AND THAT I AM WORTH BEING LOVED AND HE IS AS WELL. WE ARE CONNECTED IN A WAY NO ONE UNDERSTANDS AND THERE IS A BEAUTY TO THAT. HE HAS TAUGHT ME TO BECOME VULNERABLE.

they see things in me that I do not nor anyone else has ever as well. He knows the sorrow behind my smile, she knows the love behind the anger and the reason behind my silence. sHe has taught me the value of staying true to yourself and having a REAL relationship — even though it is the harder way to go — it is the more satisfying one in the end. I think I was so resistant to change because I thought I had to give up something — but instead I realized once I did accept change (slowly more and more over time) I have been gaining so much more.

I have found a strength I have never known — and She brought it out in me and nourished it. I am learning to focus and appreciate the process rather than focusing on the outcome. Every day I want to be better than the day before — but not for others, but for myself. I was so scared of ending up alone in life and being unlovable or not enough that I pretended to be someone I was not and not my real self until I realized the worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone.

Want to know a secret? I did not know I could sit with someone for hours upon hours and talk about anything and nothing and everything and not want to stop. There is nothing more important or as sexy as that.

WE FOUND LOVE IN AN UNEXPECTED PLACE. I KICKED THE HABIT OF HAVING TRAGIC ENDINGS TO MY RELATIONSHIPS BE ACCEPTABLE. I KNOW WHAT IT FINALLY FEELS LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FINALLY BE YOUR OWN AUTHENTIC SELF AND GIVE YOUR WHOLE SELF TO SOMEONE AND YOU DO NOT KNOW YOU ARE DOING IT UNTIL YOUR HEART IS S FILLED WITH LOVE THAT YOU CAN NOT IMAGINE ANOTHER WAY OF BEING WITH ANYONE ELSE…..OR ANYONE ELSE EVER AGAIN.

~IN LESS THAN A YEAR MY LIFE IS SO CHANGED: I CAN NOT REMEMBER A TIME WHEN i wasnt around my love of my life.

she deserves to be pampered. she hasnt had her hair done in over five years, shes beautiful nonethelss, she hasnt bought herself new clothing….even though she would gladly go to a second hand clothing store, she hasnt been on a romantic adventure, something that takes her breathe away……she is a fighter…the quiet one you wont ever know her despair but she wears it and her soul bleeds but she is the super human being who is saving so many others and i wanna give her something special away from the city with bad memories and where it can just be her and i…….

please help me make this special for her……..",christina8825,2019-04-11 19:09:44,0,874,31.52,48.63,74.46,68.93,24.28,12.93,93.48,60.18,19.45,12.59,6.29,1.37,1.49,3.2,0.23,6.86,5.03,12.81,11.21,4,8.01,2.86,17.62,5.49,2.63,1.03,1.72,2.4,7.09,4.69,2.4,0.23,0.92,0.69,11.78,0.11,0.34,2.52,0.69,15.79,4.69,1.6,1.26,2.4,1.26,5.49,2.17,0.8,0.23,0.8,2.63,0.69,1.14,0.23,0,7.55,3.55,1.14,2.63,0.8,0.34,3.2,12.36,0.69,12.93,1.72,7.44,5.03,1.26,0.11,0.34,1.03,0.34,0.34,1.03,0.34,0.23,0.11,0.23,0,11.9,6.41,1.26,0.57,0,0.46,0.11,2.17,0,0,0.23,0.69

bc9n94,An open letter to the man who broke me,"To the man who broke me

So young. So naive. My first love… or so I thought.

It all started so effortlessly. I met you when I was 16. You knew things that so many never would. So, there it began; First date, second date, and two short weeks later we were official. In no time at all, we were inseparable. I couldn’t go a day without hearing your voice, seeing your smile, hearing that ridiculous laugh; all the little quirks that made me fall so quickly. Countless dates, family gatherings, snowmobile trips, nature walks, so much laughter, and endless conversation. And just like that, eight months had come and gone.

Like the flip of a switch, everything changed. I remember that night like I remember my favorite song. A busy night at work – I missed your call, that’s all it took.

The anger in your voice, your tone, (nothing I said mattered) the strength in your hand as you struck my face, the shock I felt , the fear I had toward you. Where had you gone? Where was the man I had so deeply fell in love with? In minutes everything I thought you were had transformed. You turned into someone I had never even imagined – I could have never imagined.

Empty promises. Countless apologies.

So, I stayed.

Hopeful, the man I thought you were would return.

They say love is blind and I never truly believed it, until I had experienced it first hand. We’d fight. You’d leave. You’d apologize. We’d make up. It became a vicious cycle. It was like quick sand…for three years I stayed. But in my mind I knew I should leave… my heart kept pulling me back in to you. The name calling. The shaming. The bruises. The burns. Multiple 911 calls. And still somehow you would pull me back in. You had me brainwashed. You took all the ideas I had about love and completely destroyed them.

Then it came…

The day that changed my life forever…

The day I got away, for good. It’s a Tuesday, 5:30 pm you left your wallet at work, which only angered you more than you had already been that day. Somehow your forgetfulness became an excuse to yet again, lay your hands on me. It was my fault, so you said. Everything was always my fault. Stuck in a car with you screaming (for almost an hour), when the words slipped out of my mouth so easily

“I’m done”.

You kept me at your work almost that whole day when all I wanted was to be anywhere but where you were.

For months I dealt with your harassment. Years of therapy. Thousands of dollars in medical bills. More moves than I can count. Fear that at any time you would show up.

You broke me.

But, piece by piece I put myself back together.

You handed me the scissors, and with your actions you gave me exactly what I needed to cut the ties between you and my heart.

Little did I know that the absolute worst experience of my life would bring me to be the best I’ve ever been. Today, I am a new woman. Happy. Successful. Full of self love. Accomplishing things I could only dream of.

I am a fighter. I am a survivor. My strength is limitless. I may have forgiven you, but I will never forget.

With all the things I could say to you – the one thing I would like to say is…

Thank You.",bent_not-broken,2019-04-11 21:48:14,9,598,21.62,81.68,95.63,28.55,9.06,13.55,94.98,58.19,24.08,18.56,10.7,0.67,6.86,0,0.33,5.52,6.02,9.87,9.53,7.36,5.35,1.51,19.57,3.34,2.01,1.67,2.17,2.68,7.19,3.68,3.51,0.33,1.34,0.84,15.05,0.17,0.33,0.17,0.67,12.37,2.68,0.67,2.34,1.67,4.01,1.34,4.01,0.5,2.17,1,3.01,1.34,0.84,0,0,7.02,2.34,2.17,1.51,1,0.5,10.54,5.85,0.67,18.9,4.01,6.86,9.03,1.17,0.5,0.17,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.07,11.54,5.18,0.17,0.33,0.33,0,0,0.33,1.51,0.67,0

bciwso,Post traumatic stress?,A couple of weeks ago I tried to leave the house for a few hours to get away from my husband. He followed me outside and then proceeded to drag me back to the house but not before throwing me in the street and then kicking me while I was down. A neighbor must have seen something because I heard a man yell but no one came to my rescue. When we got into the house he locked me in the bedroom and then said he was going to kill me because I had destroyed his life. He grabbed a two lb barbell and acted as if he would bash my head in with it. The evil look in his eyes I still can’t get over. I begged and begged him not to hurt me. He then raped me anally with no lubricant before falling asleep. The police never did come to the house so I guess no one called but there were plenty of witnesses. At one point one of our roommates knocked on our door but my husband calmly told him that if he cared about their friendship he would go away. The guy turned around and walked away. .....I’m still here weeks later ( of course the next day he cried and apologized etc)...but I continue to be very freaked out easily. Yesterday he grabbed a knife in the kitchen to cut something and I backed away from him because it made me panic. I’m scared he will kill me in my sleep. I can’t stop seeing the rage he had for me that night...I never in my wildest dreams thought I’d let a man do this to me. I feel almost resigned to the fact that if I die young it will be because my spouse murdered me.,BairMooDes82,2019-04-12 14:12:53,1,306,44.54,24.62,89.21,1,18,11.44,94.77,62.09,21.57,18.63,11.76,0.98,0,5.56,0.33,2.94,6.54,14.71,6.21,4.25,9.15,2.94,16.34,3.59,1.63,0.33,1.63,0.98,6.54,0.65,5.56,0.98,2.29,0.98,11.11,0.98,0.98,0,7.19,9.48,0.65,1.63,1.96,2.29,1.31,3.92,3.59,1.31,0.98,1.31,2.29,1.31,0.33,0.33,0.33,6.54,2.61,0.33,2.29,0.98,0.33,7.84,6.21,2.29,19.61,2.94,8.17,8.5,0.65,0.33,2.94,0,0,1.31,0.33,0.33,0,0,0,0,11.44,8.82,0,0,0,0.33,0,0,0,1.63,0.65,0

bcm759,My mother withholds love to punish me. (I don't know if this is abuse),"This is probably a confusing title, but i'll try to explain. I don't know if this is a form of abuse or i'm just sensitive because I'm a victim of domestic violence from my male partners as an adult and my father when I was a child. All I know is it literally makes my heart ache.   


When my mother is displeased with something i've done, or think i'm not doing something good enough, or i've offended her in the wrong way, she withholds love. What I mean by that is, she treats me like a totally different person. Money, she'll give me. But tell her I need someone to talk to? She'll tell me she's not interested. Try to email her to catch up? She'll reply with short, snide remarks basically asking me to stop talking to her.   


She's angry with me now and i'm not sure why. She just stopped texting me and started saying i'm stupid and ""like a 16 year old"" when I MENTIONED that my boyfriend had left me money to pick up groceries and tampons. The context was ""i'm about to go to the store, \*boyfriend\* left me some cash and I need groceries and tampons."" Apparently, I am a child because I didn't have any tampons in my cupboard, because i'm supposed to ""plan ahead"", so that means I have poor planning skills so I am not allowed to speak to her until she decides she's no longer mad at me for it. I've had some health issues going on lately and I texted her an hour ago to say that I'll be going back to the hospital tomorrow and will let her know what the doctor says. Her reply, word for word was ""no thanks. I don't need to know."" I just responded ""oh, i'm really sorry"". I probably won't hear from her for a few days.  


There was a time where she was mad at me and I was in the hospital in another city. I called her to say that I wanted to come home and didn't like being in the hospital. She responded ""you don't have a home"". That is how I found out she wanted me to move into my own place. I was 21. My dad moved me into one of his empty condos (he owns condo buildings) a week later.   


One time I didn't even know she was angry, I found out after I sent her photos of my cats and she asked me to ""please not send her photos anymore, she's not interested.""  


It breaks my heart more than I could ever explain. She's literally the most important person in my life but I know i'm not the most important person in hers or even close to it. I know she could stop talking to me tomorrow and only continues to talk to me to make sure that I enough money for my medications so I don't literally die.  


I moved across the country and I have zero friends where I live, and no longer speak to a single friend from my hometown. I have no one to talk to about anything. My relationship with my boyfriend is.. strained, a lot of the time, but even if it wasn't, he can't just literally be my only person on the planet.  


We never actually fight. There's no back and forth, I never say anything like this to her. Basically every time I know that she's mad at me I just wait it out, and try to do as many little things as I can to desperately try and make her not mad at me. I hate knowing that she hates me and doesn't want me to talk to her. I'm literally s o b b i n g writing this, that's how sad it makes me. I'm never really sure exactly when or why she'll get mad, I just know that she always eventually does. It's very cold and it's very calculated. She does it to me as punishment when she feels i've done something wrong because she knows it absolutely kills me. When i'm not ""in trouble"" she will text with me, talk to me on the phone, etc. But she does like to make it VERY clear to me that we are NOT CLOSE. She has literally told me so. I once emailed her about how I missed her, and how I feel like we used to talk on the phone for hours and she responded with ""Um, we never talked on the phone for hours. I don't know where you got that, \*my name\*. We aren't that close.""   


I even feel like I need to come up with things to make her happy or proud of me so that she'll stay in her happy and nice phases for longer times. I'll make a point to mention something about work, or college, etc, that could possibly be positive or shine a good light on me and use it to hopefully make the ""mad phase"" end and the ""nice phase"" last longer.  


It just hurts so goddamn much. My heart sinks to my stomach when she tells me not to talk to her. I don't ever ask her why, or say anything rude back when she's mean to me. I just take it, cry, and hope that she'll stop soon and be nice to me again.  


Again, I have no idea if this is abuse so i'm sorry if it doesn't belong here. I just needed to vent. I'm scared one of these times she'll just... never come back to ""nice phase"" and i'll lose my mom. I really just want her to love me.",Foxelette,2019-04-12 19:56:53,6,964,8.18,26,70.75,8.45,16.07,10.27,95.23,63.49,25.73,20.12,13.17,0.52,0.21,6.22,0,5.6,3.53,12.55,10.68,8.4,7.78,3.94,21.37,4.36,2.07,2.07,0.93,1.45,6.85,2.7,4.15,0.41,2.18,0.83,14.42,0.52,0.62,6.22,0.93,15.25,2.7,2.39,1.97,4.15,1.87,4.36,2.49,0.52,1.35,0.62,1.87,0.41,0.93,0,0.21,5.91,1.87,1.24,1.45,0.62,0.83,4.05,15.56,2.59,12.24,1.35,5.5,5.91,0.52,0,0.52,0.62,0,0.21,0.73,0.1,0.31,0.1,0.21,0,19.71,6.22,3.63,0,0,0.21,0,0,2.49,5.91,0.41,0.83

Not a promotion. 

This book is really useful for anyone wanting to understand the minds of an abuser. It can help you understand why s/he might say things like “you made me do that,” or why s/he might continuously blame you. I highly recommend it this book for anyone who’s been in an abusive relationship, or is otherwise prone to attracting the ilk. 

I think an important thing survivors need to remember is that NO IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. I’ve been seeing users post about self-blame on this thread, and let me tell you something: You are only responsible for your own actions. One things this book helped me realise is that, further, you are *not* responsible for the way s/he reacts. 

Other than that, happy reading, and stay strong my loves.

bct4wh,How to hold an abusive yoga teacher accountable?,"This is a crosspost from /r/abuse

&amp;#x200B;

My friend was emotionally abused/manipulated for years and was recently ***physically assaulted*** by her former partner. The abuser is highly respected by many in our community. He is one of the most popular yoga teachers in town and teaches many classes at multiple yoga studios in the area. Several students, teachers, and employees of the yoga studio know what happened and are angry that he has not suffered any consequences. We - **including the victim** \- want him to be held accountable for his actions and be exposed as the sick, dangerous, and abusive man that he is. **What are the best resources for organizing strategies to hold abusers accountable in these kinds of situations?**

This is a delicate situation and I want to make sure that we handle it in the best way possible. There are so many things to consider, and I don't know the answers to so many questions, such as:

* Should the abuser be publicly named?
* What is appropriate to ask of the victim?

If additional details are necessary in order to best advise us, please let me know and I will add them below as needed. Here are some that come to mind.

* There was a recent incident of uninvited, inappropriate physical contact with an employee at the studio.
* Students have smelled alcohol on the abuser's breath after teaching.
* The abuser is violent, unpredictable, and mentally unstable. Some of us are therefore afraid for our own safety and wish to remain anonymous.
   * We do not trust the co-owners to respect our anonymity and are therefore considering alternatives to meeting with them in person (at least initially).
   * We are considering first addressing the co-owners of the yoga studio with an anonymous letter, although we are not sure if this is the best course of action.
* The abuser's yoga classes are by far the most well attended.
* We suspect that the owners of the yoga studio will defend the abuser.
   * They have many reasons to not want to deal with this situation, including financial concerns.
* We anticipate the ability to organize *at least* 20 people (teachers, employees, and students) who are willing to put their names on a signed letter stating unwillingness to tolerate his presence.
* Local authorities have not been involved at any point and the incident of physical assault happened several months ago.",alkaline-charm-envoy,2019-04-13 10:50:43,1,406,84.65,81.24,6.32,5.11,18.45,25.37,91.63,50.25,10.84,6.9,1.23,2.96,0,1.72,0.99,3.94,7.88,14.78,8.87,2.46,5.67,1.48,14.29,6.9,3.69,1.23,0.74,4.19,9.11,3.45,5.42,0.25,3.69,0.25,11.08,0,0.74,0.25,1.72,10.34,2.46,1.72,1.97,2.46,0.74,2.46,0.25,0,0,0,1.48,0.25,1.23,0,0.25,13.3,3.69,1.97,7.14,1.48,1.23,3.2,10.1,0.99,9.36,1.23,5.17,2.71,6.4,1.97,1.23,0.99,0,0,0.49,0,0.25,0,0.25,0,20.94,4.68,3.45,0.25,0.49,0.99,0,0.99,0,0.74,0.99,8.37

So you see why I’m torn on what to do even though I kept my promise,etc but I was raised old school and feel like I’m lying to her parents not mentioning anything. Yeah I’d stress to her mom this can’t get back to her,etc before I got into the details but a lot of me feels I need to say something so at least they’re aware. Thanks for any advice. This has been killing me.

bcwc0y,You Deserve Better,"I first joined Reddit a year ago in February 2018 after I found out the guy I was with was lying and cheating on me, despite he said he was only romantically involved with me. 

Update in 2019, a year after I post on reddit to ask for advice whether or not I should stay with him. Many unfortunate things happened:

1. We got back together for awhile, took several trips which I paid for 80% of the expenses. He still owes me around 1000 dollars. 
2. The last time we had sexual contacts was in late August 2018, after that he told me he had low libido so he didn't want to have sex with me. But we would still kiss and cuddle and see each other weekly. Later I found out he was actually sexually active with other women. 
3. We took a trip to Yosemite in December 2018, I looked at his phone for the very first time. I found out he had been lying to me all along. I found out he took the other girl to Disney, took her to meet his family, brought her on a trip with his family and friends, there are many other lies he told me I don't want to get into anymore. All along he was telling me I was the only one that he was romantically involved with, but afterwards he was doing and saying the same shit to other girls. Everytime I suspected something was wrong with what he was telling me, he would turn it around and accuse me that I was wrong for thinking like that and I was the one who is messed up in the head. He said I should be lucky for just having him in my life since he was the only one who truly cares about me. 

I confronted him after I saw the evidence on his phone and he became physically violent towards me, he hurt me and I called the police.

Currently the state is suing him, but they are not suing him for domestic violence since they think it would be harder to prove despite the fact I had physical bruises on my body from him. They are only suing him for misdemeanours since he broke my phone during the act and had a knife when the neighbors came to check on me. They are offering him a plea deal along with 14 months of domestic violence and battery program. The DA's office called me and asked if I was pleased with the deal. I haven't made up my mind yet if that's enough for what he had done to me physically, mentally, and emotionally.

I recently went to get test, found out I got low grade HPV cells. He was the only one I had sex without condoms on for the last 2 years that we were together. And I didn't start having sex again until recently but always with condoms on. He was the only one that could have give me HPV since before I got with him I was clean.

He still owes me around $1000 but I am not so sure if I should pursue it in small claims court since I have to do all the paperwork myself and present myself in court. It adds extra stress in my life and I probably don't need it right now. I might still pursue it in the future when I feel it is the right time for me to do so. 

I am rethinking the deal that the DA is considering to offer him. I feel like letting him get to away without a record on him is not fair to me after everything he has done to me. He always says he get away with a lot of things in life by cutting corners. He took an advantage of me since I was vulnerable. He claimed he was the only one who truly cared for me and tried to isolate me from my friends saying they are not my real friends. He made me believe he was only romantically involved with me, but he was actually doing romantic stuff with other girls besides sex. He made me believe with my low self-esteem I should be lucky even just to have him around in my life. 

I just want to post on this forum and let you guys know I have learned my lesson. He is not a person he claims he is, and I should have run to the hills a year ago when I first came to Reddit to ask for advice. He is quite good at lying and manipulating the situation so he can mentally control me since I was vulnerable. He was also violent towards me physically at the end and that tells a lot about what kind of person he truly is. Still he hasn't formally apologize to me, and he and his lawyer are trying to say I am the one who is crazy since I was contacting ppl around him. I only contacted 2 girls related to him. One was in a relationship with him for 10 years, I sent her a message on fb asking her if he was ever physically violent or abusive towards her. She never replied but I guess she told him. It shocks me she is still loyal to him even though they are not together anymore and this shows how deep the manipulation goes. I contacted another girl which is essentially the other girl he was cheating on me with. I told her the whole account of our history and I asked her if he wore condoms with her. She refused to answer that question and only asked me to send her prove that we were ever romantically involved. I sent her screenshots of our conversations and photos together. She still didn't want to believe me. I guess he was telling the same lies to her as he was telling me. 

I have not seen him since December and I am glad he doesn't have control over me ever again. Right now I just hope he will get the punishment he deserves and realize he can't get away with every shitty things he has done. The next court hearing will be in May, we will see if he takes the plea deal or not. If not, I am not afraid to testify in court with all the disgusting actions he has done to me. 

I have been in regular therapy sessions now I am in the process of healing. In the future I hope I can tell red flags from the beginning better and not get involved with narcissistic manipulators who don't deserve my love. I hope my experience can give you strength of breaking the cycle of being in an abusive relationship, whether it is mentally abusive or physically abusive. Remember, love yourself and you deserve better.

bcwo3x,I dont know how to move past this. I'm trying so hard and I keep failing.,"18 years. I was 16 and I think only the third time in my life I had experienced violence. He was 28 and got me pregnant. He didn't want the baby and I had an abortion.

 The people around me don't fully understand what it does to you. You get so use to the violence and anger that it becomes normal. That's all you know. He's tired, he's not feeling good. What do I need to do to not make him upset today?! 

I left almost 8 months ago and I'm still trying to figure out what a normal life can be like. People feel sorry for you and think they understand...you never will unless you have been a VICTIM. I'll say it again...I WAS a VICTIM. It's still hard to say it because I hate to admit that, but I was. I still have to deal with him but I'm recovering. Slowly and painfully. 

I want to feel sorry for myself. I want somehow to go back to being 16 and listening to EVERY one around me telling me to RUN! To leave because you are better than he ever will be.  Some how you never really believe that because you've gotten so use to someone making you feel like you are a complete piece of shit and you believe it completely. 

I'm tired of feeling like that. I'm tired of people still making me feel like that. I'm sick of people making me feel like I just need to get over it. What the hell do you think I'm doing?!? You lose so much of yourself and it is hard as hell getting it back!!

bcxio1,Unsent Letter to My Abuser,"I wanted to write this to him so badly.  But I won’t. Because, as I keep needing to remind myself, don’t feed the narcissist. 


You’ve written that I’ve given up on the relationship.  What relationship? 
I haven’t given up on anything.  In fact, though you strangling me was the hard line that you had crossed, even that next day, I hadn’t fully given up on resuscitating the relationship while it was in its death throes. 


You killed it. 


You killed it, not when you wrapped your hands around my throat.  At that point I was still hopeful something could be done.  No, you killed it when I asked you two small questions the next morning.  


Will you quit drinking? 


A resounding absolutely not.  You got angry I dare even suggest it. 


Will you go to counselling? No.  Of course not.  You hated therapists.  You thought they were wastes of time. 


That’s when you happily nailed shut the coffin on our relationship.  You nearly killed me, and the two things necessary for me to be able to trust you again were things you refused to do. 


It was not my job to convince you to want to change.  I wasn’t going to plead and beg anymore.  I had asked you those two questions for years.  I naively hoped that this time you would finally see how serious it was. But no, you didn’t.  You would only finally quit drinking and attend therapy after I had left. 


And the funniest part is, even then I still hadn’t entirely given up on the relationship.  I wasn’t willing to go back. But there was a part of me that knew, if you had done all the right things and said all the right words, I might have. 


But you didn’t. 


Because you’re a selfish, narcissistic person who only thinks about himself.  You belittled me in your first emails to me after I had left.  You threatened to go to the police over the dog.  You so beautifully highlighted years of financial abuse (‘thank you for leaving me half-ish of our – mostly MY money’).  It’s laughable because I had given up so much to move there with you.  My life stagnated for two years while we lived in your father’s basement. 


 Remember the whole ‘going to save up for a house, that’s why were doing this?’ That was the reason you gave me for it. And to think, after me scrimping, feeling ashamed to get medical help I needed (my condition is much worse now, but you always made me feel so guilty about spending any of ‘mostly YOUR money’ that I’m only now getting it dealt with, supported by people who do love me), that I wouldn’t even want to go out.  That you had taken MY car to work everyday to earn YOUR money and left me stranded in an unfamiliar town, with no friends, and no way to get around, and no sense of entitlement to spend so much as a penny on myself.  


And what was the result of this effort? It was having barely $2k saved up for when I left.  $1200 of which was an engagement present from my aunt.  So a very hearty ‘fuck you’ for haemorrhaging our money away on all of your vices; on gambling; on alcohol.  You accused me of hiding money away from you in your final email to me.  You’re right.  I did keep money away from you.  You weren’t to be trusted with it.  As you had obviously shown me.  You weren’t making a pittance either.  Over under a grand a week, with no bills and no rent.  We should have been set.  


I still reread those emails, with the memory of you threatening my friends and family that you would get a police warrant issued for me. Laughable for me. But it certainly did show me exactly what a self-centred piece of shit human being you really are. 
Then you sent me flimsy half-assed “why did you leave? I love you so much” messages.  Those sent my blood boiling.  You knew exactly why I had left.  And yet you refused to acknowledge it. Because you’re selfish and you wanted me to just rugsweep the fear and trauma I had gone through.  You wanted me to pretend that everything was ok. 


Then you ignored my boundaries yet again.  You got your therapist to message me.  I shut that one down hard, but was absolutely astounded she even agreed to it.  Astounded that I hadn’t made it crystal fucking clear I wanted you to stay the hell away from me for my own healing. 

Then you created a fake profile.  And I so so stupidly messaged you back.  I wanted to know about you.  I missed you. Curse my stupid, ever-bleeding heart. I wanted to see if you were ok.  And yet, then I realised something funny in our messages.  You didn’t care to know how I was doing.  You didn’t want to offer to support me.  You still weren’t fully assuming responsibility for nearly killing me. 


It was such an interesting difference in the messages.  Mine were supportive and encouraging.  ‘Good for you for going to AA.  I’m so glad you’re looking into therapy.’  
Yours were indulgent and self-victimizing. “You don’t know how hard it’s been since you left. You don’t know how miserable I am.  You don’t know how much I hate myself.’ 


It was such a startling difference to everyone else in my life. They were constantly asking if I was ok.  If I needed help.  How was I looking after myself.  How glad they were that I got out safely and smartly.  EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. 


Except you. 



Because a narcissist does not trade his spots.  


So I blocked you again.  I couldn’t cope with it.  You were hurting my healing.  I told you as much earlier, but you steamrolled right over that and told me how important it was for YOUR HEALING that I continue to talk to you.  So kept talking to you until I couldn’t anymore.  It was just a few days.  I blocked you. 


Then came two more emails. 


A long rambling one, outlining all the reasons you should have gotten therapy earlier.  How it all really started ten years ago.  How it was your parents divorce that made you drink.  How you drank more for feeling inadequate when you couldn’t find a job, and I was supporting us.  How you thought us moving to your home country was a mistake, but you still felt we needed to do it. 


Then you said if there was any hope, to cancel the one thing I had been dragging my feet on doing.  To cancel the sponsorship visas. 


You had laid out an ultimatum.  Either I give you no more hope (I’m not exactly sure what I was doing to encourage this hope… but ok), or that I ‘let you go’
Well I damn sure wasn’t ready to take you back.  You hadn’t changed.  You’d just put on a shinier façade.  I wanted a genuine change.  I did not want fucking lip service.  But you were giving my lip service. 
So I sent you one line.  “I’ll cancel them Monday”


And then came the barrage of insults.  I hadn’t really tried in [your home country]. I was ungrateful.  I was selfish.  In fact you opened your email by calling me cruel. You ended by saying I was the one who “gave up on us.” 


So thank you, for putting that final shovel of dirt over the corpse of our relationship.  It truly is dead and buried.  You will never hear from me again.",IonicReign,2019-04-13 18:00:32,3,1284,13.41,80.62,71.33,33.84,10.03,14.41,94.55,62.69,24.92,18.93,8.88,0.86,8.57,0.31,0.31,6,3.89,12.46,10.12,7.24,7.24,3.27,20.48,3.89,1.48,2.18,1.17,2.02,7.24,3.82,3.35,0.62,1.71,0.31,15.42,0.39,0.16,0.16,0.31,13.55,2.18,2.49,2.88,2.02,2.1,3.5,1.79,0.55,0.47,0.7,2.57,0.7,1.09,0.23,0.47,6.7,2.49,0.78,2.18,1.09,0.55,10.98,6.54,1.64,13.01,2.02,5.84,5.45,1.32,0.39,0.39,1.17,0.08,0.78,1.09,0.55,0,0.47,0.08,0,18.69,9.5,2.65,0,0.16,0.47,0,0.39,1.01,3.74,0.47,0.31
bcybzw,Depression and Self-hatred.,"Hello Everyone I'm a 19 year old girl, I recently left my physically and emotionally abusive boyfriend. I know I should be happy, but I'm really not. I have depressive swings some times but I've never really hated myself like I do now. I don't know if I've been traumatized or if I miss him or something but my self-confidence is at an all time low, and I'm kinda struggling.I spend a lot of time alone, I have like no friends left and my self identity is just gone.

bcymiz,"He got violent again, says I fell.","My (41f) boyfriend (41m) and I have been together for almost six years. They have been rough and rocky as he tried to recover from addiction,  was out of work a lot, but I loved him with all my heart and I thought I could help him.

I have several serious health problems but I still did what I could to make sure we had what we needed financially. I also cooked, I cleaned, I did all the laundry. Even when he was out of work. 

Last week we had an argument because he was pissed that I didn't have all the rent. (I have paid either all of it or 80 percent for the last 7 months.  We make about the same amount of money since he is back to work now, but for some reason he feels like he should not have to pay half. He didn't speak to me all weekend last weekend after saying that we will never have anything.  Then acted like nothing ever happened throughout the week. 
He didn't want to talk about it. 

Fast forward to last night. Some friends of ours came over,  he pressured me to drink even though he knows I do not like to drink.  Said I was no fun, etc. So we had a bonfire, music, etc.  Everyone noticed he was in a foul mood all night.  

Eventually,  they go home, I go to bed and he wakes me up having sex with me. When he finished I lost my shit. And started yelling at him. I said that he was a giant man child and that he didn't want to grow up and that all he cared about was himself.  

He proceeded to put his hands on the side of my face, holding my face roughly while he screamed at the top of his lungs.... I managed to get turned around to head out of the room and he shoved me from behind.  I never saw it coming. Literally hit face first on ceramic tile. As soon as I hit the floor he starts yelling that I ""fell"" . I said no I didn't fall. If someone falls, instinctively they put their hands out to brace the fall. I have a huge gash on my nose, there was blood everywhere when my  (15) daughter heard me crying and came out to see if I was ok.  I dont know what bothers me more, the fact that he tried to make it look like my fault,  or the fact that my daughter had to see her mom lying in a pool of blood. I don't ever want her to go through this. 

He left after it happened.  And now he is back, in the basement supposedly packing his things. I just want him out of our lives yet I am scared of surviving without him. I have no family and her biological dad has nothing to do with her. 

Before you ask, this has happened once before.  About 3 years ago. He was in a rage, no alcohol involved and knocked over furniture and pinned my head to the floor... he is 6'2 220 lbs and I am 5'2 130 lbs. 

He swore it would never happen again. I believed that if I could keep him happy that it would be ok...  here i sit 3 years later with a broken nose, black eyes and not able to move one of my arms. I don't even want to leave the house because I look so bad. :(

I probably should have gone to the hospital but I am so embarrassed that I put myself and my daughter in this situation.

bd62v7,"For 10 years, I have held this in. [Warning: sexual assault and pedophilia as well]","Sorry, a large portion of this is about sexual assault to a minor. I looked around and couldn't really find a (active) sub, so I came here. If sexual assault or pedophilia triggers you, please exit this post. Also, this is kind of a long story and I typed it in a single sitting after seething and crying from an argument with my stepfather, so I apologize for the length and any mistakes.

Here I go.

When I was in around 2nd grade, my stepfather (I'll refer to him as J, because I hate implying that I'm related to him) began to inappropiately touch me. While I played browser games on my laptop, he would lay down next to me and either grope my chest or slide his hand down my underwear and into my vagina. Every time, I would make no noise or reaction to it, continuing playing as if nothing was happening.

It continued for a while. Sometimes he would come into my room and lay on my bed next to me and do the same. I don't have a lock on my door. My older sister had one, and he broke it so that she wouldn't be allowed to close her door.

One morning, before school (I think it was in 3rd or 4th grade), he came into my room at around 7 AM. This time, he decided he would go all out. J touched me as he normally would, but then he slid my underwear down and began to eat me out. I felt no pleasure, and I pretended to stay asleep because I was scared. I was just a child - I didn't know what to do. After that, he pulled out his penis and attempted to penetrate me. However, I ""woke up"" and slammed my legs shut tight. He tried to pull them apart but then gave up, pulled my underwear back up, kissed me, then left.

I am now 17 years old, and this has been my secret for 10 years. 

While he never again attempted to ""fully rape"" me since then, he still gropes my chest and my genitalia. As always, I never let a single peep out of my mouth as it happened. 

He even grabs my butt or slaps it in public areas, and at home even when my family is around. I think they thought it was just a playful slap, because they never said anything about it. But little did they know, every touch he enacted on me, made me want to physically tear off my skin and wash myself down to the bone. 

This is something that has haunted me day and night since I was a child. It never leaves my mind. I have tried to have boyfriends, even girlfriends, but it's a struggle for me to be physically intimate with them because of I'm always reminded of him. 

Last year, in the summer of 2018, after weeks and weeks of anxiety-inducing thought, I finally managed to muster up the courage to tell someone. I decided that I would tell my mom - the woman who has raised me and loved me and encouraged me and belittled me all together (Asian moms are amazing at tough love), but also the woman who forced this man into my life. 

The man that would corrupt my mind, ruin and twist it into blackened shrivels of dread, hopelessness, fear, inferiority, and submission. The man that made it so that for years, I would panic and freak out at any touch I received from others, accidentally or intentionally - and it hurt me so much to see the sadness and hurt in my friends' eyes when they wanted to hug me out of love, but all I did was shove them away from me and start brushing away their touch. I didn't know how to explain to them that it wasn't their fault. That I loved them so much and I want to hug, hold hands with, sit next to them - just touch them - so badly, but I just can't. 

... So I finally told my mom. It was the day that she was picking me up from my biological father's house. I live with my mom and J, but I visit my dad every other weekend. He has his own set of problems and I also have issues with him, but it's heaven compared to my mom's house. When we neared my mom's house, I introduced it by saying that I had something to tell her. Something that has bothered me for nearly a decade, but that I wanted to talk alone as my little brother was also in the car. We came home and as soon as my brother entered the house, I burst into tears.

Through heart-wrenching sobs, I explained everything to my mother. I told her about the 9 years of sexual assault, and the rape attempt. I told her that her husband was a child predator, a criminal, a sex offender. And do you know what she told me?

She told me to never tell anyone ever again.

My very own mother, sided with this piece of scum over her own daughter. Never in my life have I ever felt so betrayed. I struggled over this for 9 fucking years and just now found the courage to tell the person that I thought I could trust most. My heart was immediately broken.

She told me that I could not tell anyone, especially not the police, so that we can continue to live a comfortable life. J makes well over six figures and my mom wanted a piece of it. It's not even like we would struggle without his income as she makes $80k a year, but she wanted a life of luxury. She wanted designer belts nearing a grand, designer handbags - a different one to match each outfit, shoes, a new dress for every party so she'd never have to repeat an outfit, and so on. 

But the funny part is that only she got to live the comfortable life, and even then, she had been subjected to his anger outbreaks and had thrown furniture, bowls, plates, even our water fountain at her and us. J couldn't give 2 shits about the rest of us.

My mom dared to tell me to never raise my voice to J, to always speak kindly and lovingly to him, and to let him live his life so that she can live in luxury - all in the same sentence as her telling me that she loved me. How does that fucking make sense?

I told her that I couldn't, that it was too much for me to handle anymore. I begged her to let me live with my older sister, who also moved out because of J but due to domestic violence, not sexual assult. My mom refused to let me, saying that it was too dangerous for me to live in an apartment so close to other people. So we compromised at me not telling the police if she spoke to J about it and made him stop. Boy, was I naive for believing her.

While it did stop for a few months, J started to touch me inappropiately again. He probably realized that I was still powerless against him, and that I was too scared to go to the police regardless.

Alongside the sexual harrassment, J is also extremely prone to violent outbreaks. Once he got into an argument with my mother and he came into my room, and threw a 19"" laptop at me. I dodged, but unfortunately, my wall didn't. I still wake up to the hole every morning since that day in elementary school - a constant reminder of the unprovoked attack on me. 

He also once grabbed my phone out of my hands, and threw it at the wall just because I was texting my biological father about going to a birthday party. I cried and curled up into a fetal position on the floor while he yelled profanities at me. To this day, I still don't understand why it made him so angry. He was also a big fan of the punishment where you kneel on top of the stone floor for several hours with your hands up. If you tried to sit down or loosen the position, he would yell at you and make you do it for longer. As a child, this was especially torturous. I was an extremely skinny kid and my bony knees painfully dug into the stone. I would have red marks and pain for days.

But it's not just me who deals with his anger. My step-brother (let's call him N) was never the brightest crayon in the box and this angered J to the moon. Every day after school, he would duct tape N to the kitchen table and chair, and would force him to read out loud for around 4 hours. His legs would be taped to the chair legs, his torso to the back of the chair, and his hands flat on the kitchen table. If he didn't read loud enough for J to hear, he would get hit. If he messed up, he would get hit. If J wasn't home, I would be the one in charge of watching him to make sure he did his reading properly. I didn't like it but I was too scared of the consequences. 

Besides the reading, any misbehavior or bad grades would lead to violence. At one point, he even pulled out a kitchen knife on N, who was elementary age at the time, and cut his face.

My little brother never faced anything from J, besides the occassional kneeling punishment. I tried my best to protect him. I wouldn't be able to bear seeing him hurt, and I would rather take it for him than for him to get hit.

So there it is. 

As each day passes by, the bigger my urge is to report to the police. However, my inner love for my mom makes me feel guilty as I don't want to ""ruin her life."" She's struggled a lot in the past so I feel as if I should struggle to keep her happiness.

I also feel like that even if I reported, that nothing could happen. I don't have any visual proof like pictures or videos. Nothing has scarred on me or N, so we don't have physical proof of abuse either. He never actually penetrated me with his penis, only his hands and his mouth- so I'm still a virgin and I'm not sure how I could prove that he attempted to rape me or has been sexually touching me. I feel like I don't have any ""evidence"" to say something.

Now that I'm 17, all I feel like I can do is just to continue. One more year and I'll be in college, hopefully with scholarships so that I'll be able to go out of state and get away from this hellhole. And that's honestly my lifeline right now. 

While I do want to succeed in life, my main driving force is just a primal need to escape. Every hour I've studied, every score I've received, my 4.4 GPA, and my dream of a 36 on the ACT -- it's all so that I can get away from this man. 

By this point, I've resigned myself to quiet determination as a mask for my inner turmoil, constant nightmares, daytime flashbacks, depression, anxiety, and fear. 

I've dealt with this for 10 years.

bd8m5k,"New female neighbor causing tons of noise all around the clock, pounded on door, threatened","TL/DR; Is it worth getting a protective order against a female living above your apartment that is harassing you and keeping you up at night and physically pounding your door and threatening you with violence?

Story: She moved in a few months ago, noisiest people I've ever lived below, her and her boyfriend and his child, I talked to the father the first time but it was just the kid, they both got kicked out by the female, and she randomly will make a ton of noise after hours through 7 am sometimes, slamming doors, pounding on the floor, dropping heavy things, sometimes yelling and crying...

She thought at some point that I was causing a bunch of noise from other apartments that were pissing her off, she came down and pounded on my door at night and accused me of a bunch of stuff, but we worked it out, traded numbers... a little later I text her about a sliding balcony door that we have that wakes me up if she's not careful at night, calmed down, days later she comes down knocking on the door complaining again about neighbors, I tell her to confront them she does, she says they call her names, I tell her to call the cops, she does, they arrive and leave, everything is golden for days.

Last night she's making a ton of racket after hours, all of the above, no response to text or phone call, I call the cops on her and she of course acts innocent with them... after they've left it's calm or a while but then a loud slam and she comes down pounding on my door yelling why did I call the ""po's"" on her, I yell back why, she won't stop pounding or yelling so I tell her to leave, then that ""I have a gun and will protect myself if I have to"", she finally backs off yelling and accusing up the stairs, I get out my cell phone to record video and an argument ensues where she denies everything and accuses me of it all and threatens to kick my ass and comes down to try... she eventually got arrested partially because they discovered she lied about her accusation of me pointing a gun at her and threatening to shoot her. 

I was told by the police to get a protective order, but she's been vindictive and while she could go to jail for even talking to me if the judge approves it (which may require her to show up to court for an assessment where she could just lie and accuse me of things)... I don't want it to instead bite me in the ass if the judge doesn't approve it or takes her side.",reproska,2019-04-14 15:37:55,1,478,60.7,77.43,43.93,2.26,47.8,14.44,91,59,20.5,16.11,5.65,0.42,1.05,7.53,1.46,4.39,6.69,15.69,6.07,3.77,8.16,1.05,14.85,2.72,1.26,1.05,0.42,2.3,4.39,0.84,3.56,0.84,2.93,0.21,16.74,0.21,0.63,7.95,0.63,8.58,0.42,1.67,1.46,2.93,1.26,3.35,3.35,0.42,2.72,0.21,1.46,0.63,0.84,0,0,10.04,1.05,0.63,6.07,1.26,1.88,3.97,7.53,1.46,19.67,2.09,10.67,6.69,1.05,0.21,2.51,0.42,0,0,0.63,0.63,0,0,0,0,14.44,3.77,6.49,0.21,0.21,0.21,0,0,0.84,2.09,0.42,0.21
bd8nn1,Discarded and totally lost,"This is the first time he has actually discarded me. We had been doing really good no fighting for about 2 weeks. Then he gets a job, literally comes back from his first day at work and it all changed. Was shitty to me in front of his work friend in a very braggy sort of way. That night I had won tickets to a show and I wanted him to go but he lost his ID and the venue cards everybody. So I end up going with my friend who hates him. After the show, he is sleeping in the living room, gets mad at me for cooking, pushes me away when I try to lie down w him.

The next morning he chews me out because I apparently was a dick to him and ignored him all night long. Then he starts blasting what I like to call his *fuck a bitch* playlist... basically when he’s mad at me he plays the same 4/5 songs all really shitty hip hop with themes of “we can’t trust these hoes” lol I’m literally laughing as I write that at how ridiculous and immature he is BUT while we’re deep it a fight it honestly feels like torture. He was being to shitty I decided I didn’t want to drive him to work and called him an Uber (that I paid for) which he takes as a sign of disrespect.

He came back from work late drunk and we started fighting immediately. I was the first to get physical but it escalated to him choking me, trying to zip tie my hands together, and kicking me in the chin with his shoes on. During the struggle I bit him a number of times and he was so angry about it. He left and I haven’t seen him since. I blocked him on everything and I want to maintain no contact. I’m very hurt he obviously created a fight out of nothing so he would feel justified in taking off. I have suspicions there’s another girl and it hurts. I sacrificed and suffered a lot. I feel like I built him up just for him to leave me with less.

bd9czl,Feeling worthless at this point,"I'm a 20F and my boyfriend is a 23M we have been together for two years and in the last 6 months things have gotten physical. 

Background Knowledge: my boyfriend cheated on me before we were together for a year. I also later on cheated on him as well. We both never had sex with the people we cheated on one another with. I've had gotten over his cheating but yet he can't get over mine. I also suffer from PTSD I was raped, sexually abused as a child, and my moms ex did things to me. My boyfriend knows all this stuff. 

The fight before the one we had today...
Last fight was over me being too tired after being out late till 3 in the morning and not wanting to go celebrate his stepdad birthday at 10am. He got in a huge fight with me to the point where he's dragging me on the floor and knees me in my ribs and knocks the wind out of me. Then I ran to the bedroom (the door to bedroom doesn't lock do to a previous fight and our bathroom door is also busted) he came into the bedroom and we started hitting one another and he threw me to the ground and he picked me up still bent down and asked if this is how I was fucked when I was raped then he picked me up threw me on the bed and said or was it more like this. It triggered me into a panic attack and he was like oh yeah now your shaking. He ended up manipulating me into going to the party and then everything was normal and we had to just act like it never happened. 

Today's fight was over him following the guy off my account that I cheated on him with. This morning he saw the guy didn't except the request yet so he canceled it I un canceled it because it just looks weird for the notification to pop up then he gone and now it look weirder by me doing it again and I just shouldn't have done that but I know that now. No I haven't cheated on my boyfriend since that one time nor have I spoken to the guy since that night. Anyway he went and was clearing out his clothes saying he was done with me. I was like okay if your done let me help with your things I nicely grabbed his things and was carting them to the couch. He flipped out on me and started choking me he threw me on the bed grabbing me from my hair my neck everywhere. I didn't want to fight so I didn't fight back at first until he hit me in the head then I grabbed him and hit him in the head that's when he kicked me to the ground and had his foot on me then he jumped on my ribs. I was hyperventilating just from it hurting so bad I couldn't move for a good 5 minutes once he did that the fighting stop he felt bad and told me he never meant to hurt me. 

He told me he wants to do couples counseling and he doesn't want us to brake up and the only reason he threaten to leave and grabbed his clothes is he thought I would beg him to stay. No one knows that our relationship is like this I don't tell anyone and he doesn't either. I feel like it's wrong what goes on but I don't know if it's actually wrong or how to get away on my own. If I tell my parents they hate him tell my friends then they won't want him around and I can't leave him.

bda78c,"Scared to leave abusive boyfriend, how can I do it?","I have the opportunity to leave the city we reside in and move to a much larger city with better jobs but I am terrified. I am a single mom of two young grade school kids. I literally do it all by myself, I have nearly lost most of my family support due to my choice in a partner.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in and out- mostly in this very abusive relationship and I am ready to get out and stay out. He’s being charged with assault and I currently have a protective order on him though that has not stopped him or us in continuing a relationship. I fear if I do not continue a relationship he will come after me or my children. His last threat was in the form of his own suicide attempt (3rd) after he heard I was talking (literally small talk) to one of, whom I did not know, high school friends. At this point in our relationship the physical abuse has subsided but the emotional and at times sexual is still very much there. I know if I am to stay in the current semi-small city we live in I won’t be able to get away from him.

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully we have assistance to move, though I don’t know where to start. I’ve applied to jobs in the area where we may move to and I have started looking for a roof over our heads, but I can’t help and still be scared to leave. How am I, a young woman, going to be able to raise two kids in an unknown city, with no family or friends, and still heal from the trauma of abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, moving seems impossible with the current time frame of things. Our lease ends within the next 20 days, and two weeks after that my kids leave overseas to see their grandmother for the full summer. I am so lost and discouraged. Is it possible to move within 20 or so days?

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone share success stories of leaving as a single parent or just to say a prayer that we are able to take the right path for us as a family to live better.",Mami11223,2019-04-14 18:21:06,1,389,66.04,56.13,92.31,7.77,21.61,11.57,93.06,57.84,15.17,12.08,7.2,2.57,0,2.06,0.26,3.08,6.17,16.71,9.25,4.37,7.46,1.8,17.74,6.68,2.57,1.29,2.06,1.54,6.17,2.31,3.86,1.29,1.54,0.77,12.08,1.54,1.03,0.77,2.31,8.23,1.29,0.51,0.77,3.86,0.26,4.11,1.03,0.51,0.51,0,1.54,0.26,1.03,0.26,0,12.34,6.17,2.57,2.83,1.8,0.77,2.31,15.42,1.29,19.79,3.6,10.03,6.43,1.8,0.77,1.03,0.26,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.65,4.11,3.08,0,2.06,0.51,0,0.51,0,1.29,1.03,2.06
bdb536,When I leave,"I’ve accepted that I HAVE to leave, that things will never change as long as I stay, but I’m getting overwhelmed thinking of all that I’ll lose when I go. To help combat this feeling, I’m making a list of all the things I’ll gain when I’m free. Please make your own lists in the comments and let’s inspire eachother!

• I will get to spend time with my sister/ best friend again. We’ll do our makeups together like old times.
• I will get my first car and be able to go wherever I want with no one breathing down my neck

• I will be able to go shopping, get my hair done, get my nails done, and have a tan for the first time in 7 years
• I will be able to wear leggings in public again.
• I can go to the beach in a bikini for the first time in 5 years.
• I can work jobs I like and that are fulfilling and not be forced to work jobs I hate

I’m sure there are more but that’s the best I can do at this time, I’m hoping your lists will help me think of even more positive things that will happen when I leave, besides just not being abused anymore.",Throw_n_thru,2019-04-14 19:53:19,13,454,15.73,12.6,90.46,50.43,28.38,9.25,94.71,61.67,19.82,14.54,13,0.66,0.44,0,0.44,5.07,2.86,13.66,16.96,5.73,6.39,2.64,25.99,3.3,2.2,2.2,1.76,0.88,6.17,3.74,2.42,0.88,0.66,0.66,5.29,0.22,0.66,0.22,0,9.47,1.54,1.76,1.76,1.1,1.98,2.2,1.76,0.44,0.88,0.44,2.2,0.66,0.22,0.44,0.88,11.23,2.2,5.73,2.2,2.42,0.66,1.32,18.94,5.73,13.88,2.86,4.19,7.27,1.76,2.2,0.88,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.54,3.08,3.08,0,0,0,0.22,0,0,3.3,0.44,4.41
bdcduq,"Am I being dramatic (as my friend said), or is this a real threat?","Hoping someone with experience or insight on abuse can help me make sense of this:

I (29F) have known my best friend, let’s call her Abigail (28F) for over 10 years, and were best friends. She has this ex bf, Joe (26M) that she broke up with over 1 year ago. Their breakup was messy, and he even said he punched her (she denies it).

Fast forward to a few months ago, she admitted to me that she was secretly dating her abusive ex for over a year - instead of getting angry, I comforted her. She said he cheated on her with a girl named Gina (28F). 

Her ex became increasingly threatening. During my birthday, he showed up to the party uninvited, and the location was private. He cornered Abigail in her car (obviously she let him in).  He calls her nonstop, and attempted extortion with naked pictures and telling her parents they had sex (she comes from a conservative culture). 

Last week, I went to a concert with my friend. He shared his location, which was in front of her house. He also left several voicemails saying “I’m going to kill you. I’m going to murder you. Get ready to die”. I called 911 - and before the cops could come her EX FOUND US AND CONFRONTED HER - and my friend still told the cops she didn’t want her ex to get in trouble which shocked me. I was so terrified and shaken up. 

A few days later, Abigail confronted me in a group chat w my other friends, saying I went behind her back and talked shit about her - I swore I didn’t, and left the conversation. Abigail then told my other friends she “KNOWS” I told Gina the details of that night. She said I talk shit about my other friends too (not true). She said I’m DRAMATIC and nothing ever happened to me, so me and all my friends are overreacting. She said that I was the one that caused all the drama that night. She has feelings for her abusive ex and doesn’t want him to get in trouble. She also said, she doesn’t want to be friends anymore. 

I am at a loss at how she would think I could betray her to the girl her ex slept with, I am shocked she doesn’t see how her ex is terrifying (I mean I would’ve been in that car he threatened to total), and I’m upset I never got to explain myself. Our last words were me swearing I never told anyone, apologizing to her, and wishing her the best. Am I being dramatic or are my points valid? She cut off all ties with us - I’m afraid she is back with her ex.",mantis326,2019-04-14 22:24:18,5,472,24.73,90.53,9.51,1,16.86,14.41,93.01,57.42,26.27,22.25,9.11,0.85,0.42,11.44,0.42,4.03,4.03,11.65,8.69,3.6,5.72,1.91,19.7,3.6,1.27,0.85,0.85,1.69,7.42,1.69,5.72,1.69,2.97,0.42,25.42,0.21,2.33,9.32,2.75,9.75,2.33,0.85,1.91,1.27,2.12,2.12,3.6,0.64,2.33,0.21,1.06,0.85,0,0.42,0,10.38,5.08,1.06,3.6,1.69,1.27,9.11,8.47,1.06,12.92,2.54,5.72,5.72,0,1.48,0.21,0,0,0.64,2.54,0.42,0.21,0,0,0,19.28,5.51,4.45,0.21,0,0.42,0,1.06,0.85,2.54,4.24,0
bdi4w1,The Angry Placostomus is at it again,"More of a rant than anything.  I've posted before but I didn't use his nickname my friend gave him.  Gave him that name since 1) he has no front teeth and ducks the life out of anyone near him. And 2) literally just an awful angry person who lives off of tormenting anyone and anything in his path. Anyways... 

This morning,  my friend was browsing mugshots as its something we do. And who would you expect to find? Him! Battery by strangulation on a pregnant person.  Court date earlier today. I just got my protection order granted not even a month ago. After he ran and refused to be served for 3 months.! We've been split since mid-December. For this poor soul's sake I hope he is not baby's father.  And I hope she doesn't go back.  

This girl makes third case in under 18 months.  He needs to be locked far far away. I'm sure he's done more. It sadly wouldn't surprise me. I would love to help this girl keep away. But I don't want to spoil her either.  Thinking about talking to the State Attorney and begging them to give him Max everything just to save the next poor soul but not even sure how to go about it let alone word it or if it'll just be sweeped under the rug.

bdjvc1,Isolated so much that now I’m not even speaking to my mother,"The first thing my mom said when I told her about my abuser last September was, “How could you let this happen?”

To be fair, she’s never known how to say the right thing. I decided a long time ago she is very likely on the autism spectrum, which allows me to *attempt* to see the world through her eyes, although I usually fail to understand how she can be so cold and pragmatic when I need her love and affection the most. Our relationship has been strained for the last 5 years or so because of this conflict. She’d rather bury her head in the sand than have an emotional conversation.

What I think she meant to say in her initial response to my revelation of abuse, and what I helped her navigate to in that first conversation on my abuse, was that I present as a very strong and opinionated person to the outside world. It took a while to get there, but I was able to understand her confusion that me, her loud, arrogant, bossy, confident daughter didn’t just chop his nuts off the first time he laid hands on me. And I’ve told her several times since this happened that her careless comment was hurtful. I can get past it though because she’s my mom, I love her endlessly, and her brain doesn’t work the same way mine does. But this isolated comment isn’t what’s getting me down today. Just a little backstory.

So, last week was hell for me. I finally went to the police about a month ago to report my abuser. The police have taken it very, very seriously and I am committed to helping them in their investigation. It seems like every day working with the police is more emotionally draining than the last. I moved out of state to get away from my abuser, so at the end of these very long days, I come home to a sad, lonely apartment filled with cardboard boxes that I have almost no interest in unpacking. Oh and, my best friend out here (we’ve been super close for years now and I was so excited to move here to spend time with her) stopped responding to my texts and asking me to hang out since I started working with the police. It’s clear that she isn’t interested in talking about my assault and I could tell she was uncomfortable one of the last times we did talk about it. She is a fair-weather friend. And that’s fine. I don’t want that kind of conditional love. Bye, Felicia👋🏼

Good thing I have my mom, right?

Last time I spoke to her on the phone was this past Friday. I started to get choked up telling her about the order of protection I got earlier that day. And just as I started a sentence about how I felt, she shamelessly cut me off to ask my dad a question about their fireplace. It wasn’t working and she needed to solve that problem urgently... 

I immediately hung up the phone. She texted me right away because she knew she messed up. I received many texts from her detailing her pressing work with the fireplace. She actually tried justifying her behavior. She got a lot of one word texts back from me for a good 24 hours as I sunk into a deep depression. I was so mad at her, not just for ignoring me on the phone, but for every little offense I’ve ever kept track of over the years. I silently stewed for the remainder of my Friday night.

Then I exploded. Saturday afternoon, I sent her a video of my sister drunkenly beating the crap out of me a couple of years ago. I told my mother that she let me grow up in a violent household (which is the absolute truth, thanks dad) and if she had just once acknowledged the abuse my sister and I endured throughout our childhoods, maybe I wouldn’t have ended up in my last abusive relationship and maybe my sister wouldn’t be an alcoholic pos. I know it’s not totally fair to give her this much credit, but I was angry and I still am.

Now I’m completely alone.",mossbeech,2019-04-15 11:54:42,0,722,38.41,46.68,72.87,7.9,18.51,15.51,94.74,59.28,21.88,17.04,10.25,0.55,0.14,5.68,0.42,4.85,6.09,14.13,7.76,7.34,6.51,1.8,16.48,3.74,1.52,1.52,1.11,1.39,7.34,2.91,4.43,0.42,1.94,1.11,13.43,1.52,0.28,6.65,0.55,10.11,2.08,1.8,1.39,1.8,1.52,2.63,2.77,0.55,1.39,0.83,1.52,0.69,0.28,0,0.28,9,2.35,2.08,2.91,1.94,0.55,7.34,9,0.14,16.76,1.39,6.37,9.14,1.8,0.42,0.69,0.42,0.14,0.14,0.42,0.28,0,0,0.14,0,13.43,5.26,3.88,0,0,0.28,0,0.14,0.28,2.77,0.55,0.28
bdkbge,A friend (18F) needs to leave an abuser,"I invited an old high school friend of mine (Ben) over to my college dorm yesterday to spend the night. Ben and his girlfriend (Mandy) of over a year came over and when he was showering in the morning she told me he had been abusing her (Isolating, gaslighting, belittling, controlling, etc). Mandy told me I was the only friend he let her talk to and that she constantly felt ashamed of herself. I knew my Ben was mentally ill but he told me he'd been getting better. However, Mandy told me that he would have violent episodes where he would bite her or headbutt her leaving bruises, and tell her he was gonna kill himself if she left. I told her that I trusted her and I wouldn’t use this info against her. 
Every time we'd hung out together they always seemed like the perfect couple but my former friend had been hiding this whole side of his life. Another friend (Sally)  had called him out nearly 6 months ago for being controlling but Ben had us all just cut sally off.  I feel really stupid for not seeing the signs earlier but I need to do what’s right. I told sally about it because she has experience with this sort of stuff. I’m hoping she can help Mandy find friends when she gets away from him, and taking whatever actions she can. 

What’s the best actions to take to get her help and to get him out of our lives? I’m afraid that if I call the police that she’s going to be alone without any friends back in her old abusive home, she had been suicidal before, and had been hospitalized but it hasn’t helped. 

Other info: I’m in a city 3 hours away so I can’t be there as much as I want to. I will be coming back to their city this coming weekend. I want to support her as she tries to recover.

Is there some place that is confidential that you can call to help process that in between time or is that wishful thinking?",PenguinPlates,2019-04-15 15:49:07,3,103,19.46,19.12,99,43.46,20.6,14.56,93.2,59.22,20.39,11.65,8.74,0,1.94,0,0.97,8.74,0.97,13.59,9.71,6.8,7.77,2.91,17.48,3.88,0.97,1.94,0.97,2.91,4.85,2.91,1.94,0.97,0,0,7.77,0,0,0,0,23.3,9.71,4.85,2.91,6.8,0,6.8,1.94,0,0,1.94,0.97,0,0.97,0,0,1.94,0.97,0,0.97,0.97,0,0,18.45,1.94,17.48,0,10.68,7.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.68,2.91,1.94,0,0,1.94,0,0,0,3.88,0,0
bdmksd,Is my mom being abused and what do I do about it?,"I’m 18F, I have three siblings, ages 15,11 and 5 all from my mother but from 2 different fathers. 

My mom is an accomplished and successful working woman but she grew up in an abusive home. Recently after a really turbulent relationships she’s taken on a boyfriend who is only 6 years older than me. At the beginning he was overly charming. Now he’s horrid. Sulking. Being rude. Calling her ugly in front of all of us. Making violent threats. It started off with little things and I always got bad vibes but everyone brushed it off. 

My sister (11) and brother (5) are currently on holiday with her and her boyfriend, and my sister was frantically texting me about how he was telling my brother he hand his father should go back to (home country). Also, he threatened to hit my mom because of an argument. Afterwards, my sister says he pulled/ squeezed my moms arm so hard that she said “ow that hurts” and now she has a bruise. My sister also saw other bruises on my mom and confronted her but my mom always brushes it off. The boyfriend is trying to control situations so my sister and mother are never alone together. 

I confronted my mom today but she’s equally brushing it off or trying to tell me my sister is exaggerating but my sister is scared!",messsssssssy,2019-04-15 16:02:27,6,244,21.56,76.96,52.08,1,14.35,18.44,93.03,54.92,21.72,16.8,9.84,0.41,0,6.56,0,4.92,3.28,10.66,9.02,5.33,9.43,0.41,15.98,5.33,2.46,1.23,3.28,1.23,7.38,0.82,6.56,2.05,4.1,0.82,21.72,8.61,1.23,10.66,5.74,9.84,0,1.64,0.41,1.23,2.46,4.51,4.1,0.41,0.82,2.87,0.82,0.82,0,0,0,11.89,6.97,2.05,1.64,1.23,1.23,3.69,9.43,0,13.93,1.23,6.56,6.56,1.23,0.41,0.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.75,6.15,2.46,0,0,0.41,0.41,0,0.82,1.64,2.46,0.41

bdoyvc,"Lease and Rent Liability (Los Angeles, CA)","I currently live in LA and have lived with the abuser for an entire year. Our lease is now currently month-to-month. I have reported this person to the police three times - the first two times he ran off before the police arrived and the third time he got arrested. He was supposed to move out the time I filed the second report, but he wouldn't leave. I was also financially dependant on this person, which is another reason it took me this long to decide to move forward legally. I received an Emergency Protection Order yesterday and he was ordered to move out of the apartment we share, as well as not communicate with me or be within 100 yards.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to send an e-mail to my landlord to give my 30-day notice, hopefully tomorrow the latest. When I spoke with him, he said the 30-day notice still applies. However I have also read [online](https://www.womenslaw.org/laws/ca/housing-laws/breaking-leasemoving-out/what-documents-or-proof-do-i-need-give-my-landlord-get) that I can terminate my lease in less than 14 days with no repercussions as I am a victim of domestic violence. But I've also been told that it only applies to a FULL year leases, not month-to-month. Is there anyone here that might have information regarding this? And if I cannot leave prior to 30 days, is there any way I can make sure he is liable to pay half the rent (as we are both on the lease).

I've put up with 15 years of abuse in all forms I've been choked.. Thrown out of our old flat by him in the am covered in pain. Humiliation.. Verbal abuse threats. His family never were any better either they'd give him ammo to get him going. He used to fight mma and has a long record of violence under his belt. Sometimes he is the best person in the world have around others I fear one day he will take my life from me. I suffer from endometriosis and he said to me I got it as a punishment from God I have no words for this evil. His mother said to him one day he will open his eyes to me... Now he uses these words like gospel. What do I do? I don't get my point across ever he shouts over me the neighbours must hear everything I'm so embarrassed and ashamed. I've been asked ao many times by his family members and even medical staff if there is abuse taken place I lie and say no to protect him. He has done so much evil shit and I have stood by him all these years. I often wonder if his anger is through hiding the true him. Maybe he cheats he spends all his time on his phone most evenings I spend watching a movie along while his face is burying down to his phone screen. Today was bad he made me want to end my life to save the chance of him doing it. I told him he terrifies me he calls me more names. I think maybe the next time my Dr asks I will ask her what to do? We've been through so much together loss of son and miscarriages I feel he despises me for it. He makes me feel worthless. I suffer from depression and have mad a huge amount of progress this last year I went from years of agrophobic living and suicide thought to going to store for the 1st time in year's. I have being making a effort to try care more about myself lately doing a little make up doing my hair wearing something other than sweats and pj's.

bdwmnl,Encouragement needed,"I have been with this guy, call him D, for four years. I am currently broken up with him but we still hang out. We've broken up many times in the four years and always have gotten back together. The reason for that is when we aren't together, things are amazing. He's sweet, thoughtful, kind, attentive, the sex is great, the whole nine yards. In the relationship he yells, doesn't listen to me, doesn't respect me and doesn't take no for an answer. He has always ‘needed’ a lot of sex. I understand that people have higher sex drives than others but he says he needs it at least once a day. I get so tired of fighting him and saying no that eventually I just lay there while he does his thing. He always tells me to try to get in the mood. I can't. I hate it. 

He's emotionally abusive. He tells me that I'm hard to love, I never do anything for him, I don't take him out on dates (because I can't afford it) and when I do finally he seems to always find something wrong with it. 

I have lied to him a few times only because I don't want him to get mad at me seeing an old friend or texting someone who I've known for years but makes him think that there's something going on between us. I've tried to break all contact with him but he just shows up at my door. 

My family hates him and my one good friend did too until she couldn't take it anymore and stopped talking to me. When I'm with him, everything is good and it makes me believe that we could make it but I know that it's not true. 

I guess I just need help with completely convincing myself that he is not good for me and I need to get out now. I am currently planning on moving states and starting over but the closer it gets to moving day the more he is trying to convince me to stay and marry him and have a life with him. 

I am so weak when it comes to telling him what I want and need. Any advice on how to strengthen my resolve would be appreciated.

bdyw0y,Isolation,"All these stories of abuse and heartache - I am not alone. Though I wish I was alone in this - I wish no one ever has to endure this kind of pain. 

We had a beautiful love story once and now it’s become this ugly, dirty, gross hell. 

I have been reading these posts and a woman - a young Mom wrote about how she wasn’t allowed outside her one window apartment for a year. This is me but it’s been 3 years. I get to go out once a week to pick up groceries and HE is with me. If HE has errands to run it’s a lucky week for me cause I get to go. 

Before him I used to hike almost everyday at a nearby reserve where I used to live. Now I am not allowed to even take out the trash. 

“How is that possible?” You might ask. Because HE’s put security cameras all around and an alarm on the door if I leave. My 23 year old lives with us but he works a lot and has given up asking me what’s going on. 

I feel like the stupidest person to have let this happen. 

I had a job and HE made it impossible for me to continue to work. HE attacked me in the parking lot. Some co-workers tried to intervene but it only made the rage worse. My manager called the police and they tried to talk to me into going to a shelter. But I was even more terrified. 

A year later I wound up in the hospital for 4 days from all the stress and HE would call me all night accusing me of cheating with someone at the hospital. 

HE beat me the day I came home from the hospital. 

HE beat me so I’d fear him. Pulling chunks out of my scalp till there was blood. HE made sure the bruises were in places easy to cover up. Choking my neck. Squeezing my skull. Over the top rage.

I used to fight back. Now I’ve learned to go rigid and have zero emotion. But that takes more energy than you’d think.

Anything sets him off so I have to be on guard all.the.time.

Out of the blue HE wants a divorce and the sick part of me is broken over my marriage ending. I love him and HE is throwing me away. 

HE is waiting for a career opportunity to happen and then HE will file. Or so HE says.

The other part of me - the one that wants to live - is anxiously waiting to feel the sun on my face again. To be able to step outside and breathe deep. 

I have no idea how to start over at my age. I don’t have any money. I don’t have a vehicle. I haven’t worked in a very long time. I’m not even sure how to talk to people anymore.

be05ea,Does your partner have a history of abuse?,"
I’m curious as to why he’s been in so many relationships but the only one that has ever turned violent is ours. He freely admits he’s never put his hands on a woman and never thought he would until now. In his family his mother is submissive, waiting hand and foot on his family. She was never allowed to work and was/is still expected to stay home all day. She doesn’t have a problem with this. She doesn’t have a problem waiting for her husband to come home from wherever he goes during the day(always without her). She doesn’t have a problem staying beside him, silent while he watches tv. She doesn’t have a problem never having a real conversation with him. Only ever replying to his remarks about the show he is watching  etc. She doesn’t have a problem with any of it but can’t understand why she’s sad all the time and sleeps a good bit of the day. I once told her to start getting out and meeting other Women in a ladies group with interests like herself but all she could do was ask me what about her husband? He didn’t appreciate it either so she sits. My family is completely different. My mother was never expected to stay quiet and her role was beside my dad not behind him. They had their ups and downs like everyone but never was she expected to not have a voice. I wonder if because of the extreme differences in our raising, he is abusive because he needs me to be like his mother. If he expects us to be like his parents or something? I will never keep my mouth shut. Every time he hits me he tells me it’s because of my smart mouth. That if I’d stop saying or doing things to make him angry he wouldn’t do that anymore. I know that’s a lie. I hate being hit. I hate the bruises he leaves and the screaming and the choking and the pain and the threats but when I tell him to go he won’t leave. He refuses. I mean, if I make him that miserable why would he need to stay with me? Does he think one day I will bend and turn into what he has always wanted? Lol he would find excuses to hit me even after that. Back to my main point though and I’m sorry I got off topic but why is it me that he started with? I’m not going to lie, in my crazy mixed up mind it makes me feel bad because I don’t know what it is about me that’s so bad I needed to be hit. He can’t tell me either. He just cries and says he’s sorry. Did anybody else have a partner who started with them? Have they told you what was different about you that made them break and go beyond the usual verbal abusive into full blown physical?",Vetted4711,2019-04-16 15:30:01,9,507,9.33,67.49,11.54,1,14.91,12.62,97.24,64.89,24.85,19.53,6.71,0.59,0.59,10.65,0.99,5.33,4.93,11.83,12.82,6.31,7.89,4.34,24.06,4.34,2.17,2.17,0.59,1.97,5.72,1.18,4.54,0.39,1.58,0.99,19.72,1.97,0.39,4.34,8.09,17.75,2.37,2.56,4.34,1.97,3.35,5.33,2.76,0.59,1.38,0.79,1.78,1.18,0.59,0,0,6.11,2.76,0.2,0.99,0.59,1.78,3.94,15.98,1.58,14.4,2.76,5.52,6.9,0.39,0.79,0.99,0,0,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,0,12.62,5.13,0.99,0,0,1.58,0,0,0,4.34,0.39,0.2
be8x7i,Best Clauses to Include in Custody Agreements Post-DV,"Hi everyone,

Apologies in advance because this will probably be long but I will include a TLDR at the end. Backstory; I got out of a seven year long abusive relationship with my ex-JNSO in January of this year. There was a long history of emotional, verbal and financial abuse but he escalated to violence against me one night. I reported it to the police, had them escort him from the home and immediately retained legal counsel. I have a restraining order and emergency custody of our son (here in referred to as DS for Dear Son).

He happily agreed to access visits with DS that occur every Saturday in my home. I leave the house for 7 hours so they can spend the day together in a familiar environment. DS may be on the Autism spectrum (as am I) and has sensory processing struggles which new environments trigger so although this arrangement is inconvenient for me, I feel it's best to keep DS comfortable. Ex-SO started publicly dating his ex a month after leaving, and at the same time served me with papers that he is fighting me for more access to DS. I absolutely believe he is being goaded into this by his new girlfriend and possibly family members, and that ex is following along to save face, less everyone know what a terrible uninvolved father he is. He also requested that I drop the restraining order against him, which my lawyer said I might as well, but I do not feel okay about this at all. 

I did not accept his offer and continue pushing that he successfully complete a parenting course specifically aimed towards men who commit violent acts against the child's mother, prior to us discussing him having unfettered access where he can take my DS to his new house for weekends. I feel sick to my stomach that this will ever happen but the longer I can delay it, the better. My lawyer has advised that it is time for us to make a counter Offer to Settle, in which we are hoping he will finally agree to the clause about this parenting course, but I am wondering what other clauses are worth looking into adding to this offer. I am definitely including First Right of Refusal as one of the clauses. Does anyone have suggestions for other clauses I should look into and consider adding? Our offer will likely be finalized by end of week and I don't want to learn about something later and kick myself in the ass for not adding it when I had the chance.

beawqf,"I(F29) need therapy, infant's father(M31) not supportive and getting abusive","There's a lot more to this story and so i'm going to let it out here because it's starting to get overwhelming and I need to let it out, sorry it's so long. I've reached a point where I don't know what the correct thing to do is or if I'm doing the right thing, I feel like i'm getting in to more and more of a fog mentally and it's starting to have a negative impact on my physical well-being. I haven't been eating as much as I should because I don't feel hungry, which is one of the first signs of stress for me. I need to get it together since I am currently breastfeeding our 3 month old and need the nutrients and energy.

The baby's father and I had a relationship 3 years ago, after about nine months we ended it. We struggled to communicate and I constantly felt as though I was doing something wrong and not good enough. It reached a point where he would just use me for sex and company it seemed. 9 months later we reconnected, he claimed to have made significant breakthroughs with himself and had thought about me constantly and wanted to be with me. I was extremely hesitant, and after being in therapy after the relationship, was just beginning to recognize and admit that I had an anxious attachment style and issues from my past that I needed to work through. I was weary of starting something with people who seemed to have avoidant personalities such as had been identified for him.

We started dating again, I ended up asking him to be my boyfriend a couple of months in and things were going okay. I stayed in therapy and was doing well. Fast forward a few months, we started having trouble communicating again. I found out I was pregnant and after periods of arguments that included him telling me to get an abortion I kept the baby. He suggested couples counseling after things had settled and we went but things progressively got worse. I take responsibility for following him and for letting my anxiety get the best of me during conflict. He would walk away, stonewall me, be condescending, kick me out of his house, and I would pursue him even more. He broke up with me two days after I moved in to his house and the arguing got worse and progressed physically during the last months of my pregnancy. We slept in separate rooms, and it was really lonely. I spent a lot of the time crying or just feeling down in general. I had stopped my own therapy to focus on couples counseling. I had also been accepted in to a social work graduate program during this time, and am employed full time at a therapy office, I was trying to juggle all of the ""therapy"" so I felt that the couples counseling took priority.

We had the baby, she's the most amazing thing that ever happened in my entire experience and existence. Since then, I'm still in school, I don't want to stop because I want to be done while she's still little so that I can provide for her. I work full time, and I still live with her father although we're not together. We recently messed around and he told me the next day after I expressed my feelings of wanting to be together that it was a mistake and a moment of weakness on his part. My insurance doesn't cover my therapy so I will have to pay out of pocket, approximately $500-$600 a month. I want to stay with my previous therapist since she knows my background and financially it is more feasible so I don't have to spend sessions retelling things. I pay her father rent ($800), which I didn't think was fair at first since he charged his last roommate less due to special circumstances, and asked if he could help me out for 3 months and allow me to pay him $200 less. He said no and that I was being manipulative and that it was all about money for me. He didn't have to pay any of the hospital bills and he doesn't have to pay for her insurance. As far as childcare we split the cost in half and my parents watch the baby for $500 a month, which half is being put aside in to an account for the baby to be given to her when she's older.

Our relationship has gotten progressively worse as roommates. After an argument where he got up and pushed in to me while I held the baby, he strangled me and threw me to the floor. The last incident happened last night because I was trying to go to sleep and didn't want him to come in to my room and wake the baby up because he smelled like cigar smoke and wanted to kiss her. He has a key to my room and pushed his way in, as I was trying to hold the door closed I tried pushing him out and he bit my hand leaving me deep indentations and a bruise.

I think I know what to do but my mind is in a fog, I can't recognize if what I am doing or asking for is manipulative or if I'm asking for something unreasonable. I need to talk to someone, I feel like i'm doing the best I can and just need a bit of a break. I get that he doesn't owe me anything but I really need help.

TL;DR Currently working full time, in a graduate program full time, and a new parent to a 3 month old while living with ex boyfriend who is getting abusive. I feel as though I need to start going to therapy again but I can't afford it. I asked my ex if I could pay him $200 less in rent and he said no and called me manipulative.",AppropriateSurround9,2019-04-17 10:59:29,8,1019,40.44,41.47,72.74,12.7,23.7,15.31,93.52,60.06,20.12,15.6,10.11,1.28,0,4.22,0,4.51,5.2,15.01,9.81,3.83,8.93,1.86,20.12,5.3,3.63,1.18,1.77,2.16,3.53,1.28,2.26,0.69,0.49,0.49,11.38,1.37,0.39,0.98,3.83,10.79,2.16,1.47,2.75,2.55,0.59,2.85,1.37,0.1,0.2,0.88,2.94,0.49,1.96,0.49,0.49,7.85,3.14,1.18,1.57,1.67,0.88,7.16,10.11,0.59,16.49,1.86,6.67,8.34,2.36,0.1,0.98,1.77,0,0,0.49,0,0,0.1,0.2,0,11.78,4.12,3.04,0,0.1,0,0,0.2,0.2,2.94,0.59,0.59

bebn5s,I live in an abusive household and it’s taking its toll on me,"I was redirected here after looking for advice on other subreddits. I’m looking for advice on what to do as well as any personal stories related to my situation. Sorry if my post is jumbled, I have a lot of trouble putting these kinds of things coherently. Thanks in advance for any help. 

I’m not sure where to start and this is going to be a bit long but I need to rant. I [20F] live in an abusive household. Physically, mentally, and emotionally. It’s been like this since I was a child. My father [45M] is an angry abusive person and has always resorted to violence when ever I or my siblings did something wrong. My mother [43F] obviously witnesses it but she does nothing. If he goes on for too long she intervenes but she has never talked to him afterwards to tell him that he’s wrong. Although he hits me and my siblings he has never hit her. 

Last Friday my older sister came home at around 2 am. She’s 23 and she wants to have a social life but it’s impossible because of how strict my father is. As soon as she came home, my father started beating her. I was talking to my friend and he told me to stay in my room until it passed. I tried to but I couldn’t because the screaming was so loud I heard it over my music. I ran outside and turned on the lights because somehow they got turned off in the scuffle. When I turned them off I saw that the kitchen had been turned completely upside down. The chairs were all flipped over, all of our cutlery was on the floor, and my parents TV was knocked over and is broken. My sister was crying in a corner and my dad was trying to hit her again but my mom was standing between them. I was crying and I started cursing at my dad. I asked him what his fucking problem was and to stop. I took my sister to her room and locked both of our doors. This is the most it’s ever escalated. Things were actually broken. My sister has large purple bruises all over her body and seeing them broke my heart. As for me, I generally stay out of trouble to avoid his wrath. The last time he hit me though was in January when the bathroom was leaking so a bucket was put to catch water. I tripped on it so I swapped it with a smaller one and he punched me in the back. All because of a bucket. 

I told my friend about what  happened that Friday and I started ranting to him about how stuff like this has contributed to me being suicidal and depressed. I flipped out on him. I got mad at him because he couldn’t understand any of it. Then I got mad at myself for telling him any of it. I didn’t talk to him for two days until he reached out to me. It’s because of abusive people like my father, and my ex that make me unable to trust men. Eventually they end up abusing me in some way. My friend is nothing like that. I love him, he’s the kindest, most understanding, wonderful man I have ever met. He’s patient and respectful and has never even remotely said anything that would even hurt my feelings. That being said I still cannot 100% trust him. During that and other times that my father has become violent he has always been there. But I just won’t let him be there for me, and I want to, and there are moments where I am vulnerable with him and that he’s vulnerable with me. This is literally the healthiest friendship I’ve had with a man in years.  I just don’t know how to let him in completely I guess. 

This isn’t the only thing that happens or the only time, it is constant. He will scream at us every day no matter what. If the rooms aren’t clean, if we’re don’t wash dishes immediately after they’re used, if we talk too loud. I was joking around with the same friend the other day and I was laughing loudly and my dad came into my room and screamed at me for laughing. For. Laughing. I avoid leaving my room if I can so I won’t see him. And when it gets to be too much I sleep for entire days. The night of that incident I took 100mg of melatonin and slept through the entire day. I can’t take it anymore. I’m always anxious at the sound of keys or loud footsteps because in my mind it means my dads home and my day will somehow be ruined. I cannot stand to hear people yelling or screaming because I will cry. I can’t trust men because I’m too afraid of them. I’m just messed up from it all. 

The thing is I go to therapy now. I go because of trauma from other abuse. The thing is I don’t know if I can tell my therapist about this because she’s a mandated reporter. I want to deal with this but I don’t want to get my family in trouble with the law. I live in NYC so I don’t know if there are any laws for abuse like this and would like some info if there are. Even if I can’t deal with this mentally and emotionally, I want to get out. I’m going to be looking for a part time job at the very least since I have school. I don’t know what to do but I know thatI have to get out of here.",chartreusemink,2019-04-17 12:02:01,4,974,18.16,25.88,77.14,2.7,14.12,13.66,94.05,64.37,23.2,17.15,11.7,0.51,0,4.31,0.62,6.06,3.9,14.58,11.09,6.16,9.14,2.57,19.82,3.18,1.95,1.44,0.51,2.36,5.54,1.44,4,0.62,1.33,0.82,11.5,1.95,0.41,1.85,4.41,12.63,1.33,1.85,2.26,3.18,2.36,4.11,2.87,0.82,1.85,0.21,1.85,0.41,0.92,0.1,0.31,6.57,2.16,0.41,1.75,1.23,1.23,5.85,11.81,1.13,14.89,2.26,6.98,5.85,0.51,0.51,1.44,0,0,0.1,0.31,0.1,0,0,0.1,0,13.14,6.98,1.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.7,0,0.72
becfx5,Boogeyman,"It’s been five years since he left. Long enough that I shouldn’t still be haunted by his memory. I do not miss him. I never wish to see him again. He still resides in some dark corner of my mind; an ever present shadow. When I fall asleep he still torments me. Shattering my sleep into a million terrifying little pieces. Taunting me, threatening,  I run and run and run. Yet he always finds me. Takes something more from me. 

I know I am safe. That he can’t hurt me anymore. He will never touch me again. And yet he haunts me. This sudden spike in terrifying dreams coincides with him recently breaking up with his girlfriend. I pray he never thinks of me, so that I may continue my quiet, happy, abuse free life.

becg64,Not sure what a healthy relationship is with a partner.,"I have been with him for 3 years. We have broken up 2x. Once lived together. Been back together a year now and thinking of moving back in together again. 
First time we broke up I did it and I came back 2nd time he did it and he came back. I feel like I can’t tell my family we are back together much less that we may live together again bc of the judgement I will receive and the hatred towards him.  I know the situation sounds ridiculous. Do I sound like one of those idiot girls who get back together with the same guy? 

My family doesn’t like him and doesn’t know we are back together. They don’t like him bc he is 7 years older than me. I also grew up in an abusive household with a terrible stepdad. Maybe they are concerned he’s taking advantage of me when really I was the one who initiated the relationship... when we broke up my aunt sent me unsolicited advice one of the things on the list was “we liked your ex, but the age difference was not ok, but we didn’t yell or anything we just let you do what you wanted to do”. So I’m terrified to tell my family. 

We don’t fight much. He’s gotten angry but never threw anything or hit me. I don’t think this is the type of abuse I am worried about. I keep coming back to this guy like I need him.   He makes me feel like I need him, by not even doing anything. He tells me over and over that his school work must come first this semester (his last semester) and to not bother him. He doesn’t take me anywhere on dates. He is pleasant. He does do some nice things for me. He is usually there when I need him. I feel neglected, not abused. He keeps me coming back. I feel very dependent on him. What is wrong with me? Is this in some way a type of manipulation, or is it me? What’s the truth? Is this even a healthy relationship? 

The way I grew up it nobody is getting hit or yelled at all the time, you’re pretty damn lucky. I’m constantly scared he will turn, and be like my family expects him to be... controlling and manipulating.

Story: This family has been through enough shit in the past year, they deserve a break. The father(step) is a very sick man. The Mother walked away from her job, to fight a almost one year nasty custody battle, because her child was sexually assaulted. The father(bio) didn't believe the child..period and testified in open court he didn't. The mother left her job to stay at home with het family. She felt she needed to take care of her sick husband, and also protect her two children. No punishment was given for what this family has endured. They are struggling, terribly. But will still help others when they need it, if they have it.They have no clue this was made for them. The mother is also a domestic violence and sexual assault survivor 💜 (I find it a shame how this beautiful family goes out and helps others....but only one person has donated to help them, and only 20something shares.) **Please if you can, share and donate to them! They deserve a little breathing room, and a break! Thanks!!!!

berd8j,Lost,"As you know, maybe not. My previous post explains my situation but I’ll explain again. I left out some shit. 
Basically I lied about my age. By two years at least. I was 14 at the time, I said I was 16. Met up with a 21 year old, I know I’m dumb. I convinced myself I loved him and I still am convincing myself that I did. But idk, maybe easily manipulated? Well why do I have the right to say that when I LIED. Anyways. We met up. I ended up giving him a bj. Whatever, anyways he got frustrated before hand and choked me till I couldn’t breathe. Then I ended up giving in. He thought it aroused me. It did at first but he choked me to the point where I started seeing stars, I know he didn’t do that on “accident”. Today, now. About 6 months later he randomly starts messaging me. He’s currently dating an old friend of mine :) great? But apparently she wants to kill me etc. Me and her hate eachother idk why when we should hate him? But whatever I guess. So he’s living a doubly life talking to me (as a friend), honestly I don’t know what to think of the situation. I don’t know if he knows I’m younger, I think he does. But why keep talking to me if I lied? He said he made a promise to me, that he’s honoring it by talking to me. Apparently he promised to never leave me. Because a lot of people in my life tend to. He said he saw potential somewhere else and left me for my friend. Basically if he gets caught talking to me I’m DONE. Well that’s what he said, because his gf will find out and kill me and him. He’s obviously over exaggerating, at least I hope she’s not the same psycho bitch I knew. But she’s been into many fights at my old highschool. I’m honestly just shook.

bettjb,It's time to leave.,"5 years. 5 years of saying I'll be okay, that things are going to change, and that he wont hit me again. 5 years wasted. Arguably the best years of my life. 

     I'm 21 now, I've been in a relationship with my abuser for awhile now. Things weren't always bad, actually they were really great starting off. I actually thought I had met my soul mate, no one could make me feel like he did. I felt loved, accepted, and like I could be anything with this man. 

      I packed my things and moved in with him. Everything was going very well when an argument stemmed out of what seemed thin air. I ended up being hit and screamed at. It hurt so much but I convinced myself it wouldn't happen again. Except it did. More frequently. 

      I've been stabbed, shot at, beaten with blunt objects, and even beaten while I laid there unconscious from a vicious assault. My finances are in ruins and materialistic item that I held close to me, destroyed. 

     It happened again today. I was hit multiple times for getting scared because he was texting and driving, causing us to swerve all over the road. Today is the day I chose to leave. Call me crazy but I chose to write this laying right next to the man that claims he loves me.

     I have a plan set up, it's going to take a little while to implement but I have faith that everything will work out. Currently I am in Tennessee. I live in Missouri. I am getting dropped off at home in a few days to ""search"" for a new job, but as soon as hes gone I'm leaving. No money to my name but I am determined to make my way back to Dallas, my twin brother is there waiting for me. 

     I am unsure of what the future may bring but I know something better has to come out of this. I have a room waiting for me, just need to get there. I'm excited, scared, nervous, and most of all sad. I have this emptiness in my chest that physically hurts. I love myself, I just hate that I have tolerated this for so so long. 

No goodbyes. No more I love you. No more. 

I'm ready to go. 


I will keep you all posted.",imreadytogonow21,2019-04-18 19:01:10,14,398,26.13,15.74,98.21,6.32,11.06,12.31,93.47,59.8,22.36,15.58,13.07,0.25,0.5,1.51,0.25,6.78,3.27,14.07,11.06,6.03,5.78,2.01,22.36,5.03,2.51,0.75,1.26,2.51,8.79,3.52,5.28,1.01,2.26,1.26,7.04,0.25,0.25,0,2.26,9.8,2.01,1.26,1.01,1.51,1.51,2.76,1.76,0.25,0.5,1.01,2.01,0.25,0.75,0,0,7.79,2.51,2.01,2.01,2.01,0.5,5.28,12.56,2.76,18.34,3.52,7.29,7.79,1.01,0,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0.5,0,0,0.25,0.25,0,17.34,9.05,5.03,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,2.76,0,0
beu4sd,"How to (semi?) know for sure whether your partner was abusive or not? (grey area, not physical)","I’ve been broken up with my ex for around 1.5 years now but I’m still hurt by him. It wasn’t until around a year ago that when I drunkenly mentioned my ex would imply that if he committed suicide it would be my fault that I had a friend tell me “that sounds manipulative/borderline abusive” did I take a step back and reevaluate. 

My problem is, he was great for so long. I truly loved him. There were almost zero red flags. I read “Why does he do that” and it only made me more confused. He was not nice to me but ONLY at the very end (which was my fault because I broke up with him for 2 months and then asked for him back, i had left him heartbroken and suicidal) where he became a liar and manipulative, and encouraged bad habits. But he also never called me names, he would encourage me, &amp; didn’t try to control my friendships. 

I’m finally starting to see he wasn’t all great. But he’s dating and still with the girl he cheated on me with. I feel like I can’t get over with because I genuinely cannot tell if what happened between us was my fault (I stayed with him for months after learning he cheated) or if I was semi manipulated. I struggle with BPD which can cause “black and white” thinking so I genuinely feel I can’t trust my own judgment when it comes to this - I either love him or I hate him. 

There’s obviously so much more to the story but idk how to process it. 

I was just wondering if you guys had any experience with trying to figure this out? Does therapy help? Opening up to friends / family more? Reading books has only left me more confused. I don’t know who to talk to about this and the people I have semi opened up to about it seem uncomfortable discussing it further, or think I should already be over this.",crumpet9,2019-04-18 19:34:59,4,354,7.94,24.88,82.27,3.78,16.86,13.84,96.33,62.99,23.16,17.51,11.3,0.28,0.56,5.37,0,5.65,2.26,12.43,10.17,8.76,9.89,3.39,18.36,4.52,2.26,3.11,0.85,2.26,7.91,2.82,5.08,1.13,1.69,0.85,13.84,0.28,1.13,0.28,5.65,19.21,3.95,3.39,2.54,4.8,1.69,6.78,2.82,1.41,0.28,0.85,1.41,0,0.56,0,0.28,10.17,3.11,1.13,3.39,1.13,1.69,7.63,9.89,0.28,12.43,0.85,6.5,5.93,0.85,0.85,0.28,0,0,0.56,0.85,0,0.28,0,0,0.28,16.1,4.24,1.98,0,0.28,1.41,0,0.28,1.69,3.11,2.26,0.85

bf2y7l,I'm(20F) scared that my fiance(23F) might be abusive,"I originally posted this in r/relationships but they suggested I post here instead.  Throwaway acct for obvious reasons...

My fiance and I have been together for almost four years and I really do believe she is the love of my life. She's so kind and so sweet and supportive and gentle... until she's not.

It started with her yelling at me about things that she know really hurt me. Then it turned into her not wanting me to spend time with anyone except her. I understand that I work a lot so the time we get together is special, but she would blow up at me if I asked to spend time with friends and would be angry/sulk if friends came to our place (even though she agreed to have them over.)

Twice now in the past four years she has put her hands on me out of anger. During a really heated argument I was afraid due to past parental abuse and wanted to leave the situation until we both calmed down. She grabbed my wrist and jerked me back, yanking my arm and digging her fingers into my skin. I just sobbed...

I'm so hurt and so confused. I love her with all of my heart and I know she genuinely loves me too. I hope maybe she just has anger issues or something like that and it can be resolved. I'm just so tired of feeling alone and afraid. I feel so powerless and all I want is to make her happy. I know if I left she'd hurt herself or worse and I absolutely couldn't bear to know that something like that had happened to her...

So please, tell me what should I do? How can we fix this? I want to protect her and love her, what is the next step?

TLDR; She shows classic signs of an abusive partner but I still love her and want to help. How do I?",throwaway9988626,2019-04-19 12:04:16,5,339,7.61,45.31,45.71,8.27,14.12,12.09,95.58,63.13,25.37,20.35,11.5,1.18,0,7.08,0.59,5.01,2.36,11.8,8.85,8.55,11.5,0.88,17.4,4.13,0.88,1.18,0.88,1.18,10.32,4.42,5.9,1.18,2.65,1.47,14.75,0.88,1.47,7.08,0.59,15.34,3.24,1.18,3.83,4.13,1.18,4.72,3.54,0.29,0.29,2.65,4.13,1.77,0.59,0,0.29,8.26,5.6,0.88,1.47,0.29,0.59,4.13,12.39,0.88,11.8,1.47,5.01,5.31,0.29,0,0,0.59,0,0,0.88,0,0.59,0.29,0,0,15.04,7.96,1.18,0,0.29,1.18,0,0,0,2.06,1.77,0.59

bf9umw,My friend (22M) is a martyr to family violence,"I have a friend (A) that I've known for three years, throughout that time I've been his confidant and has helped him recognize patterns of abuse in his romantic relationships and his relationship with his parents (father specifically)

A's the scapegoat of the family, on days when his father is in a foul mood, he will verbally abuse A, degrade and emasculate him, giving him shit for even the slightest mistake. Threatened to throw A into the street, to call police, or commit him to psychiatric care. Calls him bitch, pussy, retarded, etc...

His father is the worst of them, although A's gotten the similar hyper-critical attitude from his mother and his sister. Because of this, A has extreme anxiety, depression and PTSD. As a teenager, A actually died once in the hospital bc his appendix ruptured, which wouldn't have happened if his father actually TOOK HIS PAIN SERIOUSLY weeks before!

So yeah... my friend A is living in an *extremely* stressful household and its affecting his mental and physical health. Recently had to bring him to a clinic due to dizzy spells, which end up as vertigo.

But of course, dear old Dad also has vertigo and is very much neglecting his health by showing how tough he is, blaming A for being a weak ""vegetable"". Last blowout was A's father getting angry because his son had the AUDACITY to ask for some food that his father was cooking.

I've been trying to help A by giving him links to services, housing assistance, job search etc, just so he can get out of that hellhole... the problem is not only he can't leave (low job security) but he won't. He fears that if he leaves, his father will just go abuse his sister (17) and little brother (13)

For those of you who been through this, what was the point where you realize being a martyr is no longer a viable option? I know I cannot make him do anything to leave but seriously...

bfbhdd,Desperate...need advice please,"I have been with my husband for 7 years and we have two kids (8 &amp;2). The 8 year old is my son from a previous. 
We have had a very tumultuous relationship and I have noticed he has gotten worse the last couple of years. He barely goes to work and he seems to have constant mood swings. Last year he punched me and called police and went to A&amp;E with two black eyes. The police couldn’t arrest him because it happened in the home and because of the laws here they can’t arrest him unless it happened outside the home. I got an order from the police to say he can’t be violent against me in the home and this lasts for five years. If he does anything again they can arrest him straight away. Nothing has happened since then except he can be really nasty and shout a lot. 
I have decided I have to leave. My eldest wants us to leave as well and he breaks my heart saying things like, we need to leave in the next month or 3 months but not three years because I’ll be 11 then and I don’t want my whole childhood to be like this.
The reason I haven’t left already is I have nowhere to go.
We live in my husbands country and I have no family or friends to help.
I work full time but I haven’t got enough for a deposit and I don’t think I could afford rent on my own due to the excruciating prices. 
I have called a domestic violence shelter and they said to come in for a chat and they will see how they can help. I have asked before though and they have no rooms available and they may be able to find a place out of town but I’d have to quit working.
What do I do?
My son is breaking my heart asking for us to go. He even said we should leave my daughter with my husband as he is really nice to her and My husband wouldn’t care if we left as long as we didn’t take his daughter. I dont know what to do as I think my son might be right. If I called the police and tried to get him kicked out of the house I’d be scared he’d be back and kill me. If I left with my son and found another place he would just be like whatever fuck off then but I don’t want to leave me daughter.

My husband never hits the kids but he can be very hard on my son and I also think my son is trying to protect me. My husband says horrible things to me and calls me names when we fight and it must be scary for the kids. He is not controlling or anything and he is also very nice to the kids and very nice to my son, even coaching his sports on the weekend. It would be better if I just had my own place and we had a custody arrangement. I am afraid of how messy it will get and due to all the attacks before I am genuinely afraid one attack will get so bad and he will choke me again and I will die.
I am desperate for advice on how to leave and any support at all is greatly appreciated.",Pjgxrjn,2019-04-20 05:02:07,5,581,18.05,43.16,59.05,6.56,20.03,10.33,95.35,63.34,19.62,17.04,9.98,1.89,0,3.96,1.2,2.58,4.82,12.39,12.91,4.48,10.84,3.1,22.72,3.96,2.07,1.2,1.89,1.2,4.99,1.55,3.27,1.2,1.2,0,14.11,2.93,0.17,0.69,6.02,12.22,2.07,1.55,2.93,2.93,1.03,4.48,1.72,0.52,1.03,0.17,1.03,0.52,0.34,0.17,0,8.78,3.96,1.38,2.07,1.38,0.52,4.82,15.66,2.07,12.74,2.07,5.16,5.51,1.38,0.86,1.38,0.52,0,0.34,0.34,0.17,0,0,0.17,0,9.12,5.16,0.34,0,0.34,0.17,0,0,0,2.41,0.34,0.34
bfbvhs,My abuser has a new girlfriend.,"May 26th will make it a year since I left my abusive husband. 

The abuse was... bad. Really bad. It was physical, but I think it was more psychological than anything. It was so slow but eventually it got to a point where I wasn’t allowed to leave the house. At all. I couldn’t work, go to school, see my family, nothing. My grandma died about six months after I left him and I feel so bad that I missed so much with her because of my husband. 

He told me he was schizophrenic and I was actually dumb enough to believe him. I actually excused the abuse because I didn’t believe it was his fault. The first time I called the cops on him because he stabbed himself and said I was next, I repeatedly told the police that he was mentally ill and needed help. They took him to mental health and he was released about two hours after. I felt bad when I finally left him because I felt bad I couldn’t be there for somebody so mentally ill. His mom called me a few days after and I told her why I felt so bad. She told me he has never even seen a psychiatrist, he lied to me for years about this. It was all an act. He told me he was schizophrenic before the abuse ever started and it makes me think the whole thing was planned. 

I have really deep scars from that. I’ll admit that. 

The other day I got a message from him for the first time in months telling me that I was a “dirty ass hoe”. I didn’t really think much of it and just ignored it. But then i noticed that he was publicly in a new relationship. It made sense because before I felt like I could safely leave, he would freak out on me, accusing me of having sex with other people whenever he would cheat on me. 

Since I saw that, then flashbacks of the abuse have started again. I feel so bad for the new girl. Part of me wants to message her and warn her of everything. I know he’ll just convince her that I’m lying. But I’m legit so worried for this poor girl.

bfjanc,Confusion,"When I was eleven my dad tragically passed away. Authorites were left wondering who to give custody over my sisters and I to. After many court cases custody was awarded to my grandmother who despite her facade of kindness, was actually shrewd and abusive. 

She called us many names, beat us on occasion, and said many things that crossed the line. Such as saying our dads death was our fault or he would never be proud of us. I had gotten so used to the abuse it seemed normal to me.

Im now in a happy marriage witha man that tries to make me happy daily. However the years of abuse has broken me and im on a long slow road of recovery.

These days now that i no longer live with my grandma she acts nice twards me and to be honest it confuses me a lot.

bfrew3,The scariest part,"The scariest part of all of this should be the easiest part.    Getting away.  I know that I can't stay in this situation. I want to say that I know I don't deserve this, but sometimes I think I do. You've made it so hard for me to crawl out of this bed that we made. All of the things you we're doing to help me, I thought. I didn't realize how big of a hole I got myself into, until it was too late. 

It's awful that you've ruined my self esteem. I allowed you to remove my support group, one by one. I trusted you when you said that they weren't really my friends, that they didn't really care about me. It was easy to convince me that my family didn't care about me, because I already felt like they never had. That made it even easier on you.

When you made me feel guilty about my rape and my adoption, I thought it was because you loved me so much that it hurt you to hear what I went through.
Now I know it's because you wanted me to feel shamed, embarrassed, and disgusted by myself. I was too strong for you.. at first. 

When my pregnancy became too hard on me, you made it so easy for me to quit my job. You could take care of us, I was relieved. When the baby came, you were a huge help. Everyone raved about how great we were doing, how lucky I was to have such a great man, and how amazing you were with our daughter.   
You worked, so I stayed home with her.   
How lucky I was to be able to spend all this time with my baby. But that was all I could do. I was allowed to take her out of the house, grocery shopping, to my friends but every time I did, I had to pay. You worked all these long hours to give us a life, why should I get to go out and have fun? I shouldn't have taken so long at the grocery store, I made you worry. You thought I was cheating on you, even though I'd never given you any reason to think that. It was my fault though, I understood.  

As your woman, its my job to have sex with you every time you're horny. If not, it must mean that Im cheating on you or that I don't want you anymore. You cry, scream, yell, break stuff, put holes in the wall. I'm a whore. I learned to stop saying no to sex, because even if I say no, I know that when I go to sleep you'll just have sex with me anyways. It's okay, I deserve that. After all, you give me everything I ask for, I can give you sex right?

I finally find a way to make some money on my own; cleaning houses. It's decent money and I can make my own schedule, as long as you'll let me use your car. This is perfect, I can make a little bit of money to buy my daughter some stuff without having to ask you for every dollar. Around the same time, you're suddenly making less at your job and need help with the bills. You've taken care of me for so long, i have no problem helping out. It's what I'm supposed to do.



Fast forward to now;   
I now see everything for what it truly is. The times you put your hands on me weren't accidents, you're not sorry or trying to get help or trying to get better. You've taken every dollar I have, I have no car, no family, no friends. Just a 2 year old little girl who loves you, and who loves me. If I leave now, I'm only hurting her. I either have to leave her with you, or take her out of her home and everything she knows, to be homeless and live on the street with me. You've controlled how everyone sees me, your friends, your family, and of course our neighbors. 
After everything you've done for me and to me, the scariest part of all this should be staying with you. Instead, it's the most comfortable solution.",Xoxosharon,2019-04-21 10:42:30,2,719,8.63,66.68,86.21,40.81,14.1,9.87,98.61,64.12,29.07,21.42,12.38,0.97,6.68,0.97,0.42,7.65,3.06,13.21,10.99,6.82,6.68,2.78,22.81,5.01,2.23,2.36,0.56,3.34,6.95,3.89,3.06,0.97,0.56,0.7,15.44,1.11,0.7,1.53,0.14,15.99,3.06,3.76,2.09,2.36,3.06,3.48,2.36,0.28,0.97,1.11,2.36,0.42,0.42,1.11,0.28,8.62,3.2,1.53,1.67,2.36,0.56,7.51,13.07,0.28,11.68,2.36,5.42,4.59,1.25,0.7,1.25,1.53,0,0,0.42,0.14,0,0.14,0,0.14,18.64,6.82,6.95,0,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,4.31,0,0
bfrkfo,Advice please,"I need to leave my husband who've I've been with for 4 years (I'm 20 he's 22) asap he has gotten so bad verbal/emotionally that my son who is four months old frowned and cried ""mama"" when my husband threatened to break my nose again. I looked right to my son while walking upstairs and whispered to him we'll get out. The issue is we work the same schedule down to breaks and I can't drive due to anexity issues. I can't leave while he's asleep because his brother stays awake all the time. I've thought about waiting until we live closer to my grandmother (move in less than 2 weeks) and just grabbing my son and making a run for it. I can't wait that long if he gets physical. We live with his mom her boyfriend and his brother so if he does get physical should I even bother calling the police? My luck they'll all say I attacked him.

bfsdhr,First time new bf has expressed anger towards me...,"Sorry for this long post!
I was in a very physically/emotionally abusive relationship for almost 5 years before I started dating my current boyfriend who is very kind, gentle, and pretty much every other good quality you could hope for in a person.
The other day, we had our first “fight”. Actually it wasn’t even really a fight, more like the first time he got angry with me a raised his voice slightly. 
He has asked me a few times to be careful not to let the cat escape when opening the apartment door because of some mean dogs that live down the hall that he could potentially run into. 
I once again wasn’t paying attention when I opened the door to go out and he escaped. I ran after him and grabbed him, he made it half way down the hall to the elevator. As I was walking back to the apartment with him in my arms, the elevator door opened and sure enough it was the neighbour with the big dog.
So that was a close call. 
My boyfriend called out to me as I opened the door because he saw the cat escape, and that’s when he got upset.
This is the first time I’ve had a mans anger directed at me in years, and the last time I probably received a beating with it, so I guess not so surprisingly it shook me a bit. He raised his voice at me just slightly, telling me I need to be more careful not to let that happen, etc.  He was very level headed about it, I’m sure anyone else would’ve felt safe/not afraid of him for this. 
But I was afraid. I clammed, didn’t say a word as I took the cat back inside. After he was safely inside we walked together to the elevator, and I didn’t say a word the whole ride down, just played with the ends of my hair for some reason, just stared at them and fiddled with them like they were the most interesting hair ends in the world. I was keeping to myself and feeling really disassociated and really small.
When we stepped out of the elevator and were making our way outside he put his arm around me gently and apologized for getting upset. 
I said it was fine, and slowly from there I started to ease up, and was able to make eye contact with him again after a few more minutes.
Is this a normal part of healing? I haven’t felt like this in a long time, I thought I was over it all, but. I guess this is new territory for me now.
Should I talk to my boyfriend about what happened/how I felt? Or would that make him feel bad about it for no reason and then hesitate to express himself honestly around me going forward?

TLDR: had first “fight” with new non-abusive bf after years of abuse from another man. I was afraid and became psychologically dissociative. Couldn’t make eye contact, didn’t speak for a while. Should I talk to bf now (two days later) about how I felt?",teaturkey,2019-04-21 12:09:29,4,538,51.44,44.09,91.35,22.88,18.55,12.64,94.42,58.74,18.96,13.94,8.36,0.93,0.19,3.9,0.56,5.02,7.06,14.68,7.99,6.51,6.51,2.23,17.1,5.95,2.97,1.49,1.67,2.79,6.51,3.16,3.35,1.3,1.67,0.19,11.71,0,1.67,0,5.2,12.08,2.23,2.04,1.67,2.42,0.74,3.72,3.16,0.74,1.12,1.3,1.67,0.74,0.56,0,0.37,8.18,2.6,1.3,1.67,0.93,1.67,7.99,6.13,0.74,20.45,3.16,9.11,9.11,0.37,0.56,1.3,0.19,0,0,0.74,0,0.74,0,0,0,13.75,4.83,3.9,0.19,0,0.74,0.19,0.19,0.74,2.04,0.37,0.56
bfw1m1,My (25f) bf (29m) hit me while binge-drinking and it's never happened before,"I was told to post this here... So for context, my bf and I have been together for 3 years, we live together, have a business together, have cats. We've been through a lot together, we're communicative and loving, and the sex is peachy keen. Things are usually really great.

But his drinking habits are an issue. We almost NEVER drink at home, but when we go out with friends he always drinks but gets WAY too drunk. He's always the drunkest person in the room, easily. Usually it's fine but 50% of the time I drag his drunk ass home dying of embarrassment. 

So last night, we're out with friends, people are drinking socially and my bf gets wasted. He was affectionately touching me throughout the night here and there, but the more he drank the more rough he got to the point I took him aside and told him I like the affection but he needed to be more gentle cause he was hurting me. He apologized  and agreed to try to monitor his behavior and we returned to the party.

Friends start to make comments, if he was okay, and overall just growing awkward around him. I pulled him aside when he started falling over and told him he was making me feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. He told me it was no big deal, everyone was drinking and I was making a big deal out of it. I check out of the conversation as I realized he wasn't listening to me, which caused him to slap me on both my arms/shoulders hard to get my attention. 

Instantly my hackles went up and I snapped at him that he hurt me and walked away. I had to set aside my anger to get him home safe and clean up his puke all night. He's been drunk and embarrassing before, but he's never been physical. I was abused in the past (which he knows) and all I want to do is run. I dont know if I should view it as a drunken fluke or a major red flag. Thoughts?

Edit: This morning he didn't remember anything and is super remorseful. He says he never wants to get that drunk again, but I'm obviously cautious. Leaving him would be challenging financially but I think I could make it work if I had a month or two.

TL;DR!  Long term bf hit me hard on the shoulder during argument about him acting a drunken fool in public. He's never hit me before and knows I've been abused in the past ... red flag?",angelneedscoffee,2019-04-21 18:04:25,9,448,24.07,66.43,42.5,29.5,15.45,14.06,93.97,56.47,20.98,17.63,8.26,1.56,0,7.81,0,3.35,4.91,10.71,9.6,4.69,9.15,2.01,19.87,5.58,1.79,0.89,0.67,1.56,6.47,3.35,3.12,1.12,0.89,0.67,16.96,0,1.56,0,8.71,12.5,2.01,1.34,2.01,2.68,2.46,3.79,2.9,0.89,0.45,1.56,5.36,0.89,1.12,0.22,3.35,9.82,5.13,0.89,1.56,1.79,0.45,7.81,9.82,0.22,15.62,2.01,6.25,7.14,1.12,3.12,0.89,0.45,0,0.22,1.34,0.22,0.89,0.22,0,0,16.29,6.47,3.79,0.22,0.22,0.45,0.22,0.22,0,2.9,1.34,0.45

bg2lvm,He beat her so much she had a miscarriage . The tragic tale of domestic abuse.,"Opinions needed:
Apparently this woman who we will call Leah had been facing domestic abuse at the hands of her husband of three years,  she had lost three pregnancies already due to his violence.  He would sleep around, come on late, demand his food or demand sex from her depending on his mood.  Her body was basically a canvas for his painting of wrath and yet no one noticed.  They gave off the vibes of a happy go lucky couple, the kinda couple who couldn't stay a moment without each other but beneath it all she was suffering. She reached her breaking point after the fourth miscarriage(she was expecting a set of twins)  as she bled out profusely on the floor she decided she was finally going to do something. 
 After getting herself treated for the miscarriage she informed her mum who was her only living relative of what was going on and her mum told her that ""she should just endure it, that her husband was going to change, she should stop offending him and learn to be more submissive to him""  She told her mum she didn't want to go back to his home and that with her certificate she could do something with her life but her mum basically chased her out the house that she couldn't afford to have her daughter become a divorcee at whatever cost.

I stepped in, yelled at him, threatened to call the police on him. I asked if you were okay, you were in tears. You followed him after he crossed the street and ran off, I begged you not to. 

I don’t know any more than what I saw, but from a  domestic abuse survivor’s perspective, I’m really scared for you. You both seem young, maybe in high school, he had braces.

bg7qk0,Coworkers sister is being abused.,"A coworker of mine has a sister that's in a terrifying relationship. They've been married 2 yrs and they have a 3 yr old daughter. She's a stay at home mother. The man controls every aspect of her life: where she goes, when she does it, who she talks to, takes her keys when he goes to work, she can't delete messages off her phone. And worst of all he's physically abusive. He's gone from grabbing arms to hitting her in the face. He's a large man at over 6' and he's very muscular. She has no evidence except bruises and she's afraid that if she tries to expose him and it fails, it'll get even worse. So far, besides all I've said, he also made her get rid of her dog, won't let her visit her mother, and just limits her whole life. I need some advice on how to expose someone besides the obvious answers, like cameras or voice recordings.

bg80vn,My (29 f) boyfriend (33 m) randomly grabs my neck as a joke. Is this a predictor for future abuse?,"So my boyfriend and I have been dating for two years. He's a good boyfriend. We fight and get along great like anyone else, but there's something that's always bugged me, and I don't know if it's a predictor for very bad future behavior.


Sometimes my boyfriend randomly grabs my neck. It's never too hard but it can be a little firm. It's always with the approach that it's a joke or supposed to be sexy. But it's starting to piss me off. He knows I've endured physical and sexual abuse before, so I'm not really sure why he'd ever started doing this randomly, or continue to.


It also just makes me feel like my life has to randomly integrate agressive porn moves. I don't like hardcore porn and he knows that. (Let me just say I'm not 100% anti porn, I just really dislike the ones that throw the girl around. It seems from my abuse)


He also sometimes very lightly randomly punches me as a joke. Like it's very light. But I just don't know how a man can be so dumb to think that it's funny to a woman as a joke.


One time I told him to stop playfully biting me because it's annoying, and he got all butthurt saying it's what he does when he plays around and happy to be around someone. I can deal with the playful bites but the throat grabbing and the light air punching is starting to get to me.


Last night he did the throat grab to me and I decided to furrow my brow at him and kind of make an expression that I was pissed off. He seemed to pick up on my pissed reaction and tried to backtrack and say he just likes making me look confused.


So I'm hoping after this it stops. If not, I have to say something. I just hope he doesn't get butthurt.


Lastly, is this a predictor for actual abuse down the line? He's never actually hurt me. I'm just worried it's him testing the waters.



Tl;dr boyfriend grabs my neck as a joke. It's starting to make me mad. Has anyone ever dealt with this before? Is it a huge red flag or could he actually just be a moron which doesn't realize what he's doing?",athrowawaygofigure,2019-04-22 15:00:05,0,407,12.08,22.31,49.23,29.89,13.57,13.27,92.63,59.95,22.36,13.76,9.09,0.25,0,4.42,0,8.6,5.9,10.81,12.53,8.11,8.6,2.46,22.36,4.42,2.46,1.47,1.23,0.25,8.6,4.42,4.18,0.49,2.95,0.25,9.34,0,1.23,0.49,5.9,15.48,2.46,2.21,1.23,5.9,1.97,4.42,3.93,0.98,0.98,1.97,4.18,1.97,0.74,1.23,0.25,5.65,1.72,0.25,1.23,1.72,0.74,2.46,16.71,1.72,10.57,0.98,2.95,6.63,0.25,2.21,0,0,0,0,1.23,1.23,0,0,0,0,18.18,6.39,1.97,0,0.25,0.98,0,0,0,6.88,1.47,0.25

bgb6no,"Ok,12 years of abuse every abuse posible behind me","It has been 4 1/2 years since my abuser took his own life, after child protective services finally step in and (not in these words but the way I understood) either divorce or loose my kids, I left him. A month later he was gone. So, dealing with the denial of how bad the abuse was, grieving his loss, relieved he is gone and i don't have to worry about him raping me, or killing my children ( they are his as well) and myself when i left him, His family blaming me, and stopping contact with us ( which is a probably one of the best things that could have happened to us.), his family not helping with funeral cost (hell, he still doesn't have a headstone). I think i am in an ok place. I am re married (i swore i would never do) To an amazy man.

Sometimes I feel stuck as a victim, not a survivor. There my be a better way to explain this feeling but i am not sure how, yet.

My kids also have been through hell losing there dad and half their family.(even if it's for the best) feeling the same grief and relief.

My oldest ,16, (I'll name 0ne for the sake of privacy) Has had it the hardest, i think. has been in and out of behavioral hospitals, for suicide, self harming, and abusive behavior. getting into relationships with people that are abusive in one way or another. One is on the road to getting better, I hope. They recently got out of a really good hospital.

Two, 15, won't talk about it to me or counselors. Two says they talk to friends about all that they have been through. Haven't had major issues behavioral wize with them.

Three, 12, is abusive toward everyone in the house. Had domestic battery in the 3rd degree charged on them twice now, the second charge we still haven't got a court date for. We have a fins/chins petition on us for over a year now. Hasn't been much help. Have been in behavioral hospitals, no help. We have another organization that is supposed to be support for families and i am starting to believe it is a joke. When i talk to then about three's abusive behavior towards siblings, step-dad, and myself, well, mostly towards siblings probation and this other organization say ""well not to downplay it, but they are siblings, and siblings fight"" when a 12 yr old has there 15 yr old sibling on the floor kicking them in the head, shoulder, ribs, and stomach, that is more than sibling fighting.

I guess I am here today for help in how to talk to these people about how serious the abuse in my house is.

Advise on what to do with my youngest, I am at a loss.

FYI: They all have been in therapy since 2014, trama, cognitive, emdr, and a few others i don't remember off the top of my head. We have been involved in Youth MOVE

I want to share specifics of my abuse but i still shut down when i really start to think about it and start writing. I know it is therapeutic to get it out. I am hoping this will be the kick start i need, that is if it will be allowed.

bgboyb,Feeling like a magnet to abusive personalities,"Anyone ever experience anything like this before?

I was in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship for just over 4 years. My ex strangled me and hurt me pretty bad a couple of times. He also caused us significant financial problems and used all my savings after he lost his job and left the country.

He was friends with a coworker when he lived here, although they were not very close. I met him only once. He seemed nice. His coworker had loaned his bike to my ex and it was left in my storage for the last year. He recently asked for it back. I agreed to meet with him to give it back. I was friendly with him on messenger and we actually chatted for a couple of hours about similar interests. I didn’t go into detail about my ex but told him that the relationship was not healthy and it was over. That week he said he was sorry but couldn’t come to get the bike. Weeks went by and I hadn’t heard from him so I asked if he could come by this weekend so I could make space in my storage.

He arranged to pick it up today. He tried to engage me in chat but I told him I decided I didn’t feel comfortable interacting with people my ex knew because he caused me a lot of problems. He said he understood and didn’t say anything more.

 Today he showed up for the bike.

He asked me if I had any spare tubes and tools for his bike. I gave him what I had and he pumped the tires. During this, we began to talk. He asked me if I spent East with my family. I told him I didn’t have a family. He said that was a shame. He seemed nice and I felt a little bad for being sort of cold in my message to him. I tried to explain why I didn’t feel comfortable being his friend. I went into some details about my ex physically and emotionally abusing me. I told him I didn’t trust anyone anymore and was going through depression. He told me he once dated a woman who was gaslighting him so he understood what it’s like to be abused.  

He told me that I needed to open myself up to people and to move away and have a fresh start.

Then he started asking questions. I told him I didn’t want to go into too much detail but he kept asking things and I answered even though I felt uncomfortable. He basically started telling me what he thought I should do with my life (ie move to the city, get rid of my cats to make moving easier) Things I didn’t want or couldn’t do. He then started saying that I was making a choice to be unhappy and really just giving me advice I didn’t ask for. 

He said I needed to trust people again and make new friends. I told him I didn’t trust him and didn’t feel it would be appropriate for us to be friends. He said I should give people a chance (He said something like “give people a chance that have made mistakes” which was an odd thing to say). 

I started feeling very vulnerable and just not good overall. He sounded kind of like he was trying to be my friend but also judging me at the same time and telling me what I should do. Then out of nowhere he says “Well I hate to leave you like this...” 

I interjected and said “This is not your problem”. He then picked up his stuff and rode away.

I felt really upset and later wrote him this message:

‘I just want to say that I never go into detail about my personal life the way I did earlier. It was a mistake and I walked away feeling pretty upset about it. You shouldn’t put on an act of concern or offer advice or trivialize a situation you have no experience with and know nothing about. Why ask so many personal questions then abruptly leave. Who does that? You came off as really shallow, lacking in empathy and just weird. I have a valid reason for not trusting a person who is friends with someone who abused me and you weren’t trying to be my friend, you were just being nosey. I didn’t appreciate that.”


He went on to say the following:

“Well, I'm shocked. I don't like seeing someone suffer and I hoped maybe my positivity would inspire you to make some changes in your life, that's all. You're literally the only person to have ever told me that I'm shallow, lacking in empathy or weird, so I know that none of that is true. Why you're trying to make me feel bad about myself when I was only trying to help, I'm not sure - but it's not a productive way to treat people. I wish you all the best.”

I told him I felt he was projecting everything back onto me and not acknowledging what I was feeling.

I also mentioned that I didn’t trust him because my ex once told me he had several girlfriends at once that knew nothing about each other and that he was also fooling around with a married woman. I didn’t know if this was true or not but I suspect it was.

To that he said:

“Come on, this is nuts. I think you just expected a bit much from me, but that doesn't make me an asshole. You obviously really want to believe that now, perhaps because I wouldn't stay longer or I didn't offer you something further. And if that makes you happy, go ahead. But the sad thing is, we both know it only makes you feel worse.” (I didn’t call him an asshole btw)

And he also said:

“You're just embarrassed because you told me a lot of stuff and I didn't swoon in and rescue you. Embarrassment isn't a nice feeling, so you're blaming me for it. Like you blame other people for all of your problems. Time to take control of your own destiny.”

At this point he was giving me the creeps. I felt that he was probably an abuser himself and told him that.

He responded with:

“Great, I'll write that stuff about being abusive above my bed so that I remember it when I wake up every morning. Toodle-oo.”

She blew up violently, telling me the usual things - that I am a stingy asshole and that I never make her happy - telling me that her exes never let her down in this way and how easy it was to find the money she needs by finding a new boyfriend.  So with tears running down my face, barely able to see I packed up my belongings into a case and walked out.

Last week there was a similar episode when she blew up on me in the same way.  She rose to her feet and punched me on the arm.  Eventually she calmed down and apologised.

bgda02,"My uncle threatened to beat me, in front of my mother. She did nothing.","It was a political discussion, I'm left wing, close to centralist, he's very far right wing.  
My mother warned me not to talk politics with him, but he baited me into it with words I like to hear ""a political discussion is fine, as long as you can calmly debate and respect each-other's opinions.  
Music to my ears.  
So I talked with him, hoping that we could share perspectives.  
The political party he supports is very anti-Islam and refers to them all as terrorists.  
The political party I support is very far left, but I don't support everything they do. I like them simply because they have a chance of breaking the 2 party system my country has, and some of the policies they are bringing forth sound pretty good to me.  


When we got into the discussion and I brought up points like why independent parties are really good, but I don't like supporting them (basically they're not big enough to be of importance so at the end of the election they sign themselves or just their votes in support of a larger party, in exchange for them, hopefully, listening to what the independent has to say)  
Any time I tried to explain this, he laughed at me, saying I don't understand anything. I told him it'd make more sense if I could finish what I was saying. He laughed at me.  
I told him he was being really disrespectful. He laughed at me and told me I was living in a fantasy.  
I turned away from him and told him he was being incredibly ignorant, and tried to ignore him.  
He kept pushing and pushing and I eventually said  
""you're no better than a religious extremist""  
He then got up, lifted me up by my shirt and threatened to 'beat the shit out of me'  


My mother sat back and just watched this all happen and didn't do anything but cry.  


This was someone I looked up to, and defined being a man by, now he just raised his fists to me.  


I feel betrayed, and sick in the stomach, I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to confront him but that's not going to help when he didn't let me speak in the first place, and he'd just see that as an attack.

bglf79,My Story,"I've intentionally tried to not re-read and edit too much here. There may be parts that don't make sense, sorry, it was hard to get out and it's hard to re-read. I did my best.

If you have a trigger, it's in here, be warned.

I should have probably figured it out when we were first courting and she was bitching about the restraining order her ex had just obtained against her. He was a young man in his early 20s who I had met and seemed super normal, she was my age (late teens). At the time I was a pretty stupid teenage kid and just thought the guy was either the actual abuser or pathetic. Oops.

Over the next 15 years I experienced a never-ending cycle of being thrown into depressed and manic states, cheated on, physically beaten, and totally having my self esteem and confidence destroyed. Gradually all of my friends became our friends, then only her friends. I was never really allowed to meet her friends.

The patterns were set early. She started telling me that she was still sleeping with that first ex for a while (today she claims it's not the same as cheating because she was lying to hurt me and it didn't happen) a little while after the initial beating and berating had put me under her thumb. Totally destroyed me. We were just starting university and she had met a guy who kept harping on about how great his open relationship with his girlfriend was. I didn't want one, but she wanted to have sex with him, so she said we now have one and starting the next day I didn't see her for a few months while they slept together exclusively. It was early enough on that I still had social skills and the ability to connect with people intact (something I can no longer do), so I thought I left and did eventually start seeing a new girl, she was a sweetheart, but honestly I wasn't ready for a new relationship at the time (I still didn't understand that I was traumatized) and it didn't go well, especially when my ex caught wind and immediately came back into my life. Pretty soon I found myself back in a relationship with my ex and this new girl got hurt and hopefully moved on (I still have her on Facebook, she seems to be living a pretty happy adult life now, I'm grateful any damage to her seems transient).

The violence ramped after that. She had a metal lamp she was fond of throwing at me, but when you're a man and you show up with a concussion at a hospital nobody really gives a damn how it got there. I began to suffer more and more from emotional problems and whenever I was emotional she would just use it as an excuse to ghost me, although usually only for days to a week or two, sometimes for weeks or months at a time. To this day she claims ghosting is a good healthy way to keep me in check, and her therapist has validated all of this to her. I'd sit at home for days or weeks at a time, crying and now friendless while she was out with my former friends or with her friends who I'd never met. We'd been together for years but she still even refused to meet my parents, who thought I just had a cute secret girlfriend thing and didn't make anything of it. I still had no idea that this relationship even could be abusive toward me. During this period I often wondered if I was the abuser, even though she was the one that hit me (sometimes I would shove her off me if I was pinned, but I always felt terrible afterwards for doing it and usually just took it). I ended up doing 6 years to finish school, as it got more and more difficult to focus, set aside my boiling emotions, do work and actually progress, not to mention my relationship with alcohol became more and more out of control. She loved that, she always encouraged me to drink more.

I tried seeing a couple therapists toward the end of my school time. Most of them just wanted to say 'ADHD' and move on, and I actually got multiple ADHD diagnoses for the emotional problems I had stemming from this relationship. Anyone who knows what amphetamines do to anxiety.... yeah... Basically I lost all faith in the ability of therapy to help me at all. It felt like most therapists were totally missing the point and focused on details while totally missing the big picture. I could never get through to one.

Toward the end of school a small miracle occurred. A person I had known a few years earlier reached out to me out of nowhere, inviting me to a concert with her and some new friends of her. She herself was deeply troubled and I've totally lost touch with her, but I hope she's okay somewhere. I think she was attracted to me and had no idea I was still with my terrible ex (since it turned out to be myself, her and a couple on their first date), I mention that mostly because this fluke is I think the only reason she pushed through all the damage initially and actually kept me around that friend group long enough to connect with one guy. The other guy on that double date actually, and I finally had a new friend. Of course my girlfriend immediately inserted herself into this group when she discovered I had met people, and in fact began sleeping with the girl who initially invited me out.

My new friend introduced me to a whole new circle, mostly people new to my city or from the surroundings who were trying to build up a circle. They were all wonderful people. Needless to say I barely speak to any of them anymore, they're virtually all her friends or alienated from us entirely now. At least this time she didn't sleep with any more of them.

By the time school was wrapping up for me, it wasn't wrapping up for her. She wasn't really interested in working or anything, and in fact is still a student well into her 30s. That's okay, I got a job and started making money, which covered her lifestyle entirely. We would take all sorts of expensive vacations and things, and I'd fund everything. Not a problem in principle in a relationship, but in this case it certainly was, we were always 'splitting it' and she's always 'pay me back' but those things never seemed to happen. As far as I can tell, that was just a way to ensure that I could drain my bank account beyond what I was comfortable with.

Around this time she also stopped her birth control without telling me. She got pregnant. She knew I always wanted children, family, etc and I was scared, confused but happy overall. We weren't kids anymore, it could be workable (in a healthy relationship maybe). She got an abortion. So yeah, to summarize she secretly went off birth control just because she knew an abortion would kill me inside, but that I'd never try to control her body. I gained a lot of weight and got very depressed after that one.

Eventually I got a better job in another city. I moved, she didn't, but she spent more time in my city than hers. Again, not in itself a problem, but she spent her entire time here working on my social isolation. I never got to visit our old city, she always wanted to come this way, in the meantime she took all the remaining friends I had from my new friend group, and started salting anything I had left back home.

The next five years bring us to today, and they're kind of a blur. Most of these patterns continued the first few years, there were several more instances of me trying to leave, all were punished. My job performance got worse and worse, my emotional regulation issues increasingly became a huge problem in my life, my remaining focus and drive slowly left me. Then by some miracle I met the person that today is my only remaining friend. I can only imagine someone in my position without this lucky break, and I am so thankful. One of my coworkers with whom I shared interests began (I assume) to notice something was up and began to reach out. I have no idea, by this time why he put up with me, my behavior was pretty reprehensible by this time, pretty much a live wire that would randomly detonate on people, but with this relationship in a different city and a place she couldn't get to, somehow it grew a little bit. He had his own issues with a bad relationship, but it wasn't an abusive one. As he worked that out he let me into his life and I got to see how healthy relationships can function, and even though we'd never really talked about my issues much, he'd always be giving me gentle feedback and help and guidance on what I now realize were new coping and basic social skills. Finally last summer I managed to leave again. Insane as this sounds, I STILL DIDN'T THINK OF THE RELATIONSHIP AS ABUSIVE. I don't know why. I had gotten enough feedback from my coworker and his male friends about this relationship to understand it was toxic and I needed it out of my life, and I got a lot of support to finally leave it, but I didn't think it was a problem when I asked her to try to work on a friendship to replace it.

I began to try to work my way back around, and suddenly there she was, now offering herself up as my support (with benefits, as always). I told her that I had two friend groups I was trying to reopen, and that there were two particular people I was trying to contact. One of them I had already found, the other was actually at the same school as her. I asked her to reach out and get initial contact for me. We talked a while longer but she never brought him up again, then my uncle had a severely debilitating stroke and my grandfather began to die and I started talking to her about it as my 'support'. I got ghosted just as they both took a turn, she always knew how to time for maximum damage. Then the person I had asked her to reach out to's friends began removing me on Facebook. Turns out once I had given her the name, she started dating him. She had no interest in this guy, talked about how pathetic he was sexually, and she actually referred to him as 'Buster Bluth', but she dated him a while just to do the social damage. Nothing new there, he lives at home and doesn't have much of his own money and plenty of support, so she obviously didn't stick around too long once her goals hit. That was last winter.

For a little while she wasn't around, but my mental health began to slide harshly again. I found I couldn't work anymore at all, and have actually been off for several months now. I felt increasingly socially isolated again from people in my old city, and I still can't actually connect with anyone without lashing out at them or running away, so I became more and more frustrated. I tried to find counselling again, but the resources I started with probably weren't great choices and nothing stuck. Then my grandfather became critical recently and there was my 'support' again. When he died, my mother actually called her first, that was a problem for me because she of course didn't bother to pass the message along (she actually ghosted for a week) and I found out about his passing when my mother made an offhand comment about funeral homes later, assuming we had worked through it together already. Again, timed for maximum damage. I spent the next week pretty much just crying by myself, trying to go out and pretend to be social here and there.

I was sitting at home absolutely out of my mind over it, and I finally called her mother to ask what was going on. Her parents have no idea what she does, and generally I think also have a good relationship with me somehow. Better than my own parents to be honest, maybe her doing maybe not, I'm only realizing it as I write it. This put us back in contact, and I totally broke down on her. I basically became catatonic for two days in her bed. No more ability to control or regulate my emotions at all. That was a few days ago, she's been around way too much since then, and she went to her therapist to try to get me help, promising she'd manage my therapy for me. I wanted this. I still didn't know it was abusive. She was gaslighting me hard. I'd always wanted the children/family/picket fence and she never did, she chose this moment to tell me her therapist had helped her change her mind, just to get me a little more off keel. That was a couple days ago.

While trying to research help for my patterns of symptoms, I came across descriptions of both how women abuse men and generally how abusive relationships are structured attached to a lot of these resources. Somehow, being beat with objects didn't click it for me, but as I read through these lists the patterns all became clear and I saw that she had literally checked every. single. box. This realization really keyed in for me over the last two days. I've been emotionally unstable so I sat on it a bit to be sure, but I think it's true. I'm obviously not going to let her get involved in my therapy now, and I've found new resources in the community I'm going to try specifically geared towards people coming out of abusive relationships.

Today, I still feel hopeless. I'm in my mid 30s with the social skills of a teenager and no dating skills to speak of left over. I have very little idea how adult relationships (friend or romantic) are supposed to function. I recoil instinctively when I meet women in the context of romantic prospects, usually it starts okay but after a little bit it gets ugly fast, I go into literal panics. I recently can't function day to day, mostly I just pace and cry and pace and cry. I feel like even if I ever get better, I'm in for a compromise life as an old parent of a partial family or without a family, my career has been probably irreparably set back, I literally don't even know how to engage with the rest of society anymore, and can only imagine the sort of women who would want what's left of me. I also know that my abuser will never, ever see justice, just because of who we are and what we are. I don't want to live in this world and hate everyone for it.

I'm told these are supposed to go away. I can't imagine how I can ever have emotional peace without justice or giving up my core identity values around justice and equality, but I'm told not to worry about it right now. I don't believe it, and for a while I felt like my two outs were become a pathetic person who is okay with this series of events happening, or kill myself. I was leaning hard to the latter. Eventually I calmed down enough to hope there's a third way, and that people who have been here before me can help me find it. My one coworker friend had dated a lovely young lady who works as a case worker in a shelter that helps women with these issues, I've reached out to her hoping she can help steer me to a genderless or men's counterpart. I'm hoping writing this can help me organize my thoughts to communicate with her and others. I'm hoping posting it will result in meaningful contributions from others that will benefit us all on what someone where I am, the tail end of this crisis, should be doing. Or at least give some kind of notion to some young man who is entering one of these relationships that maybe he can be abused and he shouldn't stay with that girl.",abuse_throwaway_324i,2019-04-23 13:41:23,3,2806,31.25,46.29,80.16,20.88,21.42,15.93,94.44,59.48,20.14,14.47,8.7,0.64,0.11,4.7,0.32,5.63,4.7,13.79,8.62,7.59,7.48,2.46,18.14,4.95,2.35,1.6,1.07,2.96,5.6,2.6,2.92,0.18,1,0.75,13.44,0.53,1.18,4.28,1.35,14.01,2.57,1.25,1.5,3.85,2.32,3.88,1.28,0.39,0.29,0.53,1.43,0.18,1.03,0.18,0.11,9.37,3.92,1.89,2.21,1.53,0.53,8.73,7.52,0.93,17.14,1.71,6.74,8.98,1.92,0.43,0.36,0.36,0.04,0.32,0.57,0.07,0,0.25,0.07,0,13.54,4.81,4.7,0,0,0,0,0.11,0,2.99,0.86,0.07

bgnauk,Abused Male Update,"This is an update to my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/b5zegy/confused\_abused\_male/](https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/b5zegy/confused_abused_male/)

My abusive wife and I have been separated for about a month. It was and continues to be the hardest this I’ve ever done. Our son goes back and forth between the two homes (I’m in our original house and she is renting a duplex.) He seems to be doing well.

There are good day and bad days for me. Sometimes I feel sad or lonely and want her to come home. Other times I’m angry and part of me wishes that I was the kind of person who could take out my anger on her the way she did on me. In my weaker moments I remind myself that even if I don’t feel like it now, my life is so much better not having her anger in it. Not having to walk on eggshells all the time, fearful of what might set her off.

Normally when I tell this story I lead with the hitting, but that was really the least of it. She never left a mark on my sturdy frame, but I have psychological wounds that will take years to heal.

\- She ridiculed me sexually. Told me that our marriage was failing because the sex wasn’t good enough and that it was all my fault. She kept doing that, sometimes in front of friends and family, until I had so much anxiety on me that I couldn’t get an erection. She’d convinced me that keeping my family together depended on my performance in bed.

\- Eventually I asked her what she thought about me getting Viagra and she was on board. I did, and it worked great, but after a few times she told me she didn’t want to be close to someone who needed pills to have sex with her.

\- She never wanted children, but we had one anyway because she screwed up her birth control. Afterwards she insisted that I get a vasectomy.  When I was hesitant, she’d call me out about it in front of our friends.

\- She routinely hung around with groups of other men, but if I even looked at another woman, she was furious. She once got mad at me for knowing another woman’s name. 

\- She accused me of plotting to rape or assault a woman who has been a close friend for 20 years because I offered to give her a ride home. This conversation was had in front of said friend.

\- She ridiculed the way I chewed until I was so self-conscious that I wouldn’t go out for lunch with my friends.

\- She would often text me at work to give me shit about whatever was on her mind, ranging from sex that she claimed hadn’t been good enough to towels left on the floor.

\- When I confronted her about it, she would blame my father for being to hard on me as a kid and making me over-sensitive, or question why I didn’t give her shit about the things that annoyed me. (that last one is a big red flag, btw. She wanted me to behave poorly to justify her own behavior.

\- When I stood up to her, she would hit me. I said six times in my previous post but I remember more now. The number isn’t important. The look she got in her eyes when she’d do it will haunt me forever.

I could go on, there is plenty more. I guess I’m writing this for two reasons. First, Reddit has proven to be a great place to get this out.  Also, I hope that someone else reading this might see it and realize that they aren’t alone. Since I started talking to my friends and family, I’ve been astonished how many men have come to me and said that they went though something similar. Every single person I shared this with believed me.

Getting out was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. There isn’t a day that goes by when I don’t feel, at least for a moment, like maybe I was better off before; taking her abuse but keeping my family together. I keep the above list to remind me that I wasn’t, and neither was my son. 

People who have been through this tell me that it does get better. And I know from experience and some of the stories I’ve read on this sub that many men and women have had it much worse than I did.  It gets easier in time, even when it feels like it never will. I intend to post more updates like this here as sort of a journal so that someday I can refer to this as evidence that it does get better.",aurelfell,2019-04-23 16:28:15,2,813,21.53,41.73,65.37,3.95,17.3,12.55,94.83,60.39,24.6,16.36,10.33,0.62,0,5.17,0.25,8.24,3.94,13.41,10.7,5.29,6.52,2.21,19.31,4.18,3.2,1.97,1.11,2.58,6.15,1.97,4.18,0.62,2.46,0.49,13.78,1.11,0.74,5.66,1.23,12.3,2.34,1.6,2.09,3.2,1.23,3.57,1.97,0.62,0.37,0.86,2.34,0.49,0.74,0.98,0.49,8,2.71,1.11,1.72,2.71,0.62,7.13,9.1,1.11,14.39,1.35,6.64,6.15,0.98,0.86,1.6,0.25,0,0,1.6,0.37,0.98,0,0.12,0.12,18.08,6.15,3.08,0.12,0.12,0,0,1.35,0,2.83,0.62,3.81

bgo1uf,Question about violation of protection order and renewal *possession of a gun + other felony charges*,"I had a 2-year DVO against my ex fiance. It expired on the 27th of the month, and I chose not to renew it because I figured since it had been two years, I was safe. What I was not aware of was that on the 2nd, his house was raided and he was charged with two Class D felony drug trafficking charges. During the raid, they found a gun and enhanced the charges with a more strict penalty for possessing a gun during the commission of a crime (if I'm correct, this bumps the two Class D charges to Cs). My state is supposed to have a victim notification system, but I was never notified about this. I have called a victim's advocate at the court and am waiting to hear back, but my nerves are shot so I had a couple questions I figured someone on here may be familiar with.

Since he violated the order to not have a gun, would additional charges be added automatically, or does a violation of a protective order require me to press charges? Would I have to testify or something (because in the case that they don't automatically press charges there is no way I am going to make him come after me).

Also, would the charge simply be ""contempt of court"" or would it be something different since it was a gun, not a violation of one of the lesser requirements like no phone or social media contact or 500 feet restraint?

Thanks for all your help in advance, I just want to calm my nerves a bit because my first panicked thought was that I need to sell my house and skip town because where I wasn't notified of the violation, I didn't choose to renew my protective order. I just want to reassure myself I won't have to worry about him.",stairsdawg,2019-04-23 17:41:10,2,329,58.52,13.69,49.82,5.92,27.42,17.93,83.28,58.97,15.5,10.94,8.51,0,0.3,1.52,0.61,4.56,8.51,13.68,11.25,3.95,6.08,3.34,15.81,2.43,1.22,0.61,2.13,1.52,4.26,1.22,3.04,0.61,1.82,0,5.78,0.3,0.61,0,1.82,14.59,2.43,2.43,2.43,3.95,0.91,5.17,1.22,0,0.61,0.61,1.22,0.91,0.3,0,0,4.86,0.91,0.61,2.13,0.61,1.22,5.78,7.9,0.91,8.81,0.91,3.04,3.95,1.22,0,0.61,0.3,0,0,0.3,0,0,0,0,0,12.16,2.74,3.95,0,0,0.61,0,0.3,0.61,1.82,1.22,0.91

I'm seeing an amazing girl who is patient and nothing like my ex. My ex was controlling. She was great until she wasn't. We broke up 7 months ago after I finally called the police. For almost 6 months I've been alright. I've accepted lots about myself and have done the self love/emotional intelligence thing but all of a sudden I'm really angry. 

She messaged me that she's seeing someone else and I told her I was happy for her. And I definitely am. I believe that everyone deserves happiness. But part of me is really angry that she's happy. She's able to just move on. She didn't lose anything. And now she's able to continue on with her life like it all didn't happen. I've never felt this towards someone before. 

I don't have any romantic feelings about her anymore. I've been over it. But this anger just makes me wanna constantly tell her the damage she's done so she doesn't get the luxury of forgetting.

bgtqii,Did you report your abuse? Did they face charges? Did the punishment fit the crime(s)?,"It’s very hard to find proper statistics on Intimate Partner Violence vs Non-Intimate Partner Violence.  There are stats on reported incidents only. 

But what about the unreported ones?  What about the survivors that have come forward and were not believed?  Or too afraid to come forward? Or just so happy to be free of the situation they move and start over? 

I don’t know how to find the actual numbers on this. But in my life, when I spoke out about my abuse, friends and family came to me and told me about their own horrible experiences. 
 
Over a dozen, some men included, admitted to me their secret shame. They had told almost no one before. 

Of people I met along my journey in healing in groups and therapy and online, those that did charge did not receive actual justice, in my eyes or theirs. Minimal sentences. Probation. Expired restraining orders. Access to their children from family court. Further possibilities for the abusers to continue abusing through whatever means they have at their disposal, especially through the children. 
 
It’s not right. It’s not fair.

bgwzhx,He's not an ally,"\*\*tl;dr: I just overheard my partner conversation with his friend about how he can't go out because he has to take kids out until situation calms down, ""the situation"" (me being moody and nervous) which he triggered few days ago with an assault on me (grabbed my hair) and a threat yesterday.\*\*  


I (F, 30), and he (M, 37) are a couple for past ten years, of which in last four years we got three kids. He showed signs of authoritative attitude before, but just before we got kids he was getting more abusive. That escalated after we got kids. I added this to the fact we were under pressure of parenting and that we will work through difficulties.

Just to get some insight into how bad our things are: he never managed to keep job more than few months because of his difficult temper. He likes to get into conflict with other people.

While he still has one friend, I completely broke any bonds with people from my life because our friendships were never good quality. I'm socially anxious. 

He takes our kids out every day. I'm with them when he gets back.

Lots of the time I endure his temper tantrums. He's capable to spill several awful insults and later he acts like he doesn't know what I'm talking about. I can't discuss anything with him because he's over defensive and shuts off any attempt for civil talk. Most of the time our coexisting relies on his assumptions (he's pretty much Dunning Kruger) and me trying to read his mind. You can guess, that doesn't work.

My mom suffers from schizophrenia. He told that to his friend. Maybe to our landlords, too. I don't know. Just a moment ago his friend called him on a phone, asking will they go out, and he closed the door in front of me to explain he won't go out because I'm acting crazy. He's pretending as a victim. Yesterday he warned me that he will slap my face if I tell him once more that he's not a good dad. It just came out of my mouth as a futile attempt to demonstrate how hurtful such thing sounds (because he told me that numerous times before). 

I was bitter the rest of the noon and yes, I yelled at kids several times. He does that too in far more frightening way since he goes physical when mad (slams the doors, hits the wall, throws objects, or hits me - a bit less since he noticed a pair of eyes of our kids who observe). I never know will he slap me behind the doors or become rough with the kids, too. They are already distressed from his authoritative parenting, but I can't explain why they protest or why they cry more when they are with me because he won't listen. He thinks kids cry with me because I make them miserable, but it's the other way around. They can release all the collected emotions throughout the day because he constantly repeats to them \*""Don't cry. Don't be a baby.""\* He's kind of a helicopter to them and hasn't learned to listen anyone, least the kids.

So, now he got his friend ""talk therapy"", who just recently has gone through divorce with his wife (he throws things too when mad), and probably projects half of the hate onto our relationship. Besides a friend, he has our landlords who in their attempt to sympathize with him feel need to judge me as a fail mother, and he has the other grandma of one child that plays with our. He is venting about me, and they probably are not wise enough to explain that he's supposed to see me as an ally and not as an enemy. Why did I say my mom suffers from schizophrenia? Because that puts another shade of light onto our relationship, and my coping mechanism after being insulted is perceived as craziness. He is capable to completely forget that he hit me an hour ago. Denial, bipolar? I don't know.

I don't have his support. I have his judgment and he is weakening us. 

Yes, I know a proper thing is to move out, but I don't have anybody to rely on. I'm too weak ( both financially and emotionally) to go to other place, take care for the kids and earn enough to pay rent, bills, food. I want to do that when they get just a bit older because it's just damn too hard now to organize even a shower, and impossible to search lawyer, daycare, find job, and I have silent shitstorm that just waits to knock on me, my old mom and uncle who may fall into sickness any moment. I'm so scared and I don't know what to do. Yesterday I thought I'm just having an issue with a stubborn man and know I see he took an active position against me.",noahloahboah,2019-04-24 09:51:46,1,830,33,80.37,25.17,1,18.04,15.18,93.13,58.55,22.05,17.47,6.75,1.93,0.12,7.11,1.57,4.58,5.06,13.86,8.19,5.9,7.23,2.65,17.35,5.06,2.89,2.29,1.08,3.13,6.63,1.08,5.42,0.96,2.17,1.08,18.8,1.45,1.2,0.72,7.47,11.45,2.65,2.53,0.6,2.77,0.96,2.65,2.53,0.72,0.96,0.6,1.81,0.48,1.2,0,0.12,9.4,3.98,1.08,2.29,2.05,0.72,3.73,13.37,0.84,12.65,1.45,4.94,6.39,1.69,0.12,0.84,0.48,0,0,0.48,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,18.8,5.42,4.46,0.24,0.12,0.24,0,0.12,0.72,3.86,2.17,1.45
bgyi48,Can't get the courage to leave my abusive husband,"Husband and I have been living together for 8 years and married now for 7 months. He has been increasingly aggressive toward me over the last six months and on two occasions has choked/strangled me leaving visible marks. I feel so stupid for staying here but haven't found the courage to leave yet.
A few days ago we went out for a bit and an argument started between us so he said we were leaving. We got in the car and headed home and the disagreement continued. As we were pulling into our drive he grabbed me by the throat and started screaming at me. I went inside the house and he grabbed me again, this time throwing me down to the ground and running to his vehicle to leave. I called 911 but then was too afraid to tell them what actually happened. 
My husband returned later and continued to berate me. He was in my face screaming and calling me names and I was so afraid. I dont know why I did it, maybe because I was scared, but I hit him in the face and tried to run but I couldn't get away. He started to choke me again and then put a pillow over my face so I couldn't breath. I am covered in bruises and yet stupid me is still here. I dont understand how someone I've loved and lived with for so long can turn into a monster like this in less than a years time.

bh1o33,I was believed today.,"A few weeks ago, I finally ended an abusive relationship, my abuser raped, physically assaulted, manipulated and emotionally abused me for months before I had the courage to leave. 

Yesterday, I told his best female friend about the abuse. The 3 of us has been looking for an apartment together, and now it was going to be just the two of them. Something in me just knew, deep down, that if I didn’t tell her about it, if I didn’t warn her, she could be headed down the same path as me. 

I told her everything exactly as it happened, and as it poured out of me I realized, for the first time, how true it all was, that I wasn’t crazy, that what he did to me was wrong. She was shocked, to say the least, they had been friends since high school. She thanked me for telling her, revealing to me she also was a survivor, having been sexually abused at 15. She also said she saw some of the qualities in my ex that I described, she had always noticed his lack of empathy and he had made quite cruel comments to her over the years that she had always brushed off, until now. It was a moment of deep understanding, a very long and painful conversation but it needed to be done. 

She texted me today, asking if I had considered reporting it. She said she talked to her sister and a close female friend yesterday about what to do, about her feelings and such, and they both resoundingly believed me and advised her to distance herself from him. They also both begged her not to share an apartment with him. One of them even encouraged her to contact a domestic abuse hotline. She told me she will not be moving in with him, she will be distancing herself from him and even asked me if I’d be interested in looking for an apartment together.

When I saw all of this, I cried, because I had been believed. Two random strangers believed me. She believed me. I was heard. I was seen. I was believed. I wasn’t called a vengeful, jealous ex, I wasn’t told he was such a “good guy”, I wasn’t once victim blamed. I didn’t realize how scared I was of the shame I thought was sure to come, until it didn’t.   I feel like a giant weight has been lifted. I did the right thing. 

I thought I’d share my MeToo moment with you all. Some of us have and will experience shame from others, but moments like this are why we should always speak up, because someone will year us. Someone will believe us. 💛",squeakers4269,2019-04-24 16:38:43,6,457,19.4,67.7,42.8,3.21,16.32,15.54,97.37,63.46,25.16,19.91,9.63,1.09,0.22,7.88,1.09,5.25,5.25,12.69,12.47,4.6,6.56,2.19,22.98,4.38,1.97,1.31,1.53,1.97,6.78,2.19,4.6,0.66,2.41,0.22,18.82,0.22,1.09,6.56,2.19,14,3.94,1.75,1.75,2.41,2.19,3.72,3.72,1.31,1.09,1.09,1.09,0,0.44,0.44,0.22,7.88,3.94,0.66,2.63,0.44,0.66,15.1,5.69,1.31,12.25,1.09,5.25,5.91,0.66,0,0.88,0,0,0,0.44,0,0,0,0,0,16.19,6.13,7.44,0,0,0,0,0,0.44,2.19,0,0
bh295k,Guilt,"I’ve decided to leave. I’ve been making plans behind his back. Then he makes me coffee in the morning. Picks up my favorite energy drink and delivers it to my work mid shift without me asking. We laugh and listen to our favorite songs and talk about a future together that won’t even happen. I know he’ll get mad at me again. I know these good times won’t last, but when I look at his sweet smiling face in the moment, I feel overwhelmed with guilt. I can’t help but think that he’s a good person deep down who just got lost in the rabbit hole of pain and rage. I know I can’t “fix” him, he has to do that for himself, but when I leave, who’s going to make sure he goes to the doctor? Who’s going to sit with him in his depressive episodes when he’s contemplating suicide and get him through it? I feel like I’m empty and have nothing left to give. I think about the rape, the strangulations, the fact that he doesn’t think any of that stuff really even counts as abuse because he never punched me with his fist or sent me to the ER. I had scars from the rape but even though they healed, I know I’ll never be able to have consensual enjoyable sex with him again. I don’t see ya getting through this. I worry about the next rage, I think about the times he punished me by making me sit outside naked in the cold winter and wonder if it’ll get that bad again. I know it will because every other time I always thought it would be the last but I was wrong.

bh4ahe,Not sure what to do,"I’m starting to get a little bit scared and worried for the safety of myself, sister and mother, My dad has been relentlessly emotionally abused my mother and my sister has been protecting me from it. Over the past year it has gotten worse and he’s been sleeping on the couch, screaming at her, throwing random shit and punching holes into our walls. Thank god he hasn’t hit anyone. I’m just not sure what to do anymore, or how I should feel about it. He is not mentally okay, he has depression and anxiety, just.

bh9mfb,Day 3..,"Today is day 3 since I have broken free from my abuser. 

I have gone through every emotion more times than I can count, &amp; have had more breakdowns than I'd like to admit.. Our kids have been having a rough time adjusting to the new environment and just the overall change, which has made it a very tough few days for this exhausted Momma..

Our children are mutual, so I can't go completely no contact, as much as I wish I could.. However, the kids have video called him once a day since and I have done surprisingly well leaving it at that. He has sent me numerous messages already about ""the man he is going to become"" and all the great things he somehow managed to get lined up in his life. I've seen the ""Sorry's"", and ignored them. He wrote me this long message stating how it's ""not a rule anywhere that we can't be friends and get along."" 

Actually, there IS. And it's MY rule, a boundary that I have set that you no longer have the choice to cross over freely like it means nothing. He's trying to hoover me like many times before, but this time is different. I just feel so done. So unattached, from everyone and everything at the moment. I never want to be friends with a person like you, I never want another you in my life at all. Ever. In any way, shape or form. I ignore any message from him that doesn't't pertain to our children, and it feels great.

I'm just so conflicted with my feelings, I feel relief, like the world was literally lifted from my shoulders when I left. Somehow I can't beat these overwhelming waves of sadness and mourning a human being and relationship that was never truly real in the first place. 

I apologize for being so scattered, I kind of came on here during a low point and just had to let my feelings out. Soon I will seek help from a professional so I can begin to heal, and hopefully gradually unlearn the abuse. 

I'm still standing strong, still pushing on, and as much as it hurts, I'm not looking back. I never thought I would have to convince myself so often that I am a human being with worth, but here we are, and damnit I AM a humIan being with worth!",NewfoundFreedom_,2019-04-25 07:58:54,4,404,19.15,32.8,85.04,25.77,16.83,14.11,93.07,63.37,19.31,13.61,9.41,1.24,0.74,1.98,0.25,5.69,5.45,13.12,12.13,9.41,7.67,3.22,19.06,5.2,3.96,0.74,0.99,2.97,5.94,2.72,2.72,0.25,0.74,1.24,9.9,0.25,0.74,0.25,2.23,14.36,2.72,1.24,1.49,2.72,3.22,3.47,2.48,0.74,0,1.73,1.24,0.25,0.99,0,0,7.18,2.97,0.74,2.97,0.99,0,4.46,12.13,1.24,15.1,1.98,5.94,7.43,0.74,0.25,0,0.74,0,0.25,0.5,0.25,0,0,0.25,0,17.82,6.68,5.45,0,0.25,0,0.25,0,1.49,3.47,0,0.25
bhceiv,This is a lot but im desperate for advice,"Hi i have to paint this out very carefully because I dont want to paint my parents out like monster because they're not but lately I've been recommended therapy for my PTSD and I'm not anti recovery but I am not allowed to disclose details about my family life which I know is the root to my trauma next to the stem of it which is my abusive relationship I was in for a year freshman year to repeated freshman year because I had stayed back. After finally leaving the relationship my social life was torn inside own and my once very pure name was through the mud,
 he used to yell at me daily correct me 
 He slapped me on one occasion
He Pinned me to walls on school grounds and in my own home On numerous occasions
He used to Intimadate me regularly either verbally or physically
He Yellied at me over everything both school and home and public places
He Blamed me for his faults 
He Acted out unstably infront of me both school and home
*When we tried to get couple therapy by my guidance counselor he didn't let me speak and when she told him to wait outside the door he jiggled the handle and watched us 
I used to wear a promise ring and 
He Crushed my Hand on my finger it left marks On only school grounds
*He used to Grab me very often and pull me roughly throughout the halls on school grounds and in my home
*threw a condom at my face in front of a friend at school (that's for her incident.)
*He Grabbed my neck when I was trying to stick up for myself and leave atthe Mall FYE to be specific
We were at the mall and i came late so he told me to just leave and I when I began to leave he grabbed the back of my neck
He asked me if I had to kill him or my cat who would it be and why etc. And quite frankly he was mad I said I couldn't choose 
 He would flick me when I was late or if he didnt like something
He made up safewords to use when he was abusive ""dire"" was the safe word and to ""test me"" he would purposely be abusive
He manipulated
My choices And mind, My friends, his friends, etc.
Ways he manipulated me:
Against my Religion
Against my family
Against my friends
He taught me how to lie to my mother
Exact quote: 
 ""deny, deny, deny.""
 He had this obsession with us committing suicide together 
We were going to kill ourselves out of love due to him manipulating me to believe this romeo and juliet bullshit because my family didn't want us together because they knew he was bad news. He attempted suicide after the relationship as well and told me in great detail.
He Tried to control my diet
He held a video game over my head if I ""exercised"" after the relationship.
He talked bad about my mother daily he hated my mother
* He said himself to my mother while they were driving alone. ""See that house over there? They won't let me play with there kids or pets anymore."" 
(Meaning he did something bad but the situation is still unknown )
He took away privileges he told me what I cant and cant do
Sexually he completely dominated what I could and couldn't do when he wasnt around
We planned to move out together but there were many vices regarding this decision.
  Vices:
*He told me that we were going to Cut ALL Contact with my family when we move out 
*Made me vow to not introduce my future children to any religion 
*He Lied excessively and made up insane senarios
*He used to joke about how he would do little things to try to kill his own grandmother when he was a Child.

*He showed signs of Bipolar disorder 
*Embarrased me infront of my friend and my family at a public building specifically little cesars
Tore his hat once when he mad to intimidate me
Would hurt himself infront of me to make me feel bad slamming head the wall usually brick or stone
Or punch them but he mainly bashed his head
*He would show me abusive themed music to trigger me purposely.
Dog teeth, i know im a wolf,
Etc. I dont know if it was his way of apologizing I dont know
*He touched me at a child's movie theater on multiple occasions without consent he always would seduce me whenever he got the chance location was not limited to absolutely anything
He told me how to dress I wasnt allowed to wear dresses in front of him
*He took out his phone during sex and when I accused him he said he was ""just testing to see if id would notice.""
After the relationshipe he continued to harrass me directly and indirectly he spreads rumors and slanders my reputation
*He tried to befriend my Boyfriend (ben) at the time and 
Went back in forth telling lies and telling the truth.
The school cops did virtually nothing
All of these things happened when I was 14-15 I lost my virginity at 14 to him and I regret every second every act everything 
Theres a lot more but it's honestly too much to even put that was just what I have in my notes and mind of the current.

Now my family life alright, here we go
I have lived a pretty comfortable family life I know that they love me but there is a bit more to it unfortunately my dad grew up in a Heavily abusive household his mother actually hated him and his father though he cared about him he was very rough around the edges  when my dad finally left his house you can probably imagine how traumatized  he was he became an alcoholic at a very young age and through my mom he got over it for her he stopped drowning his life and partying and finally got himself together but when we had like my third sister his old friend came back and he started to altered what my dad had fixed  he started drinking again and my dad started to get very disrespectful toward my mother he has hurt on numerous occasions that she really doesn't like talking about she has scars on her body to prove it and I have seen them but she overtime learn to handle him and he doesn't really do that stuff anymore because she'll literally rip him a new asshole my mom is a super tough cookie and despite being very sick with diabetes and fibromyalgia she is a bull in the matador and no one to fucks with her despite constantly always being on her deathbed she's a wonderful person but she's also kind of rough around the edges and she's definitely not afraid  to beat the crap out of us when were bad or if we don't do something she wants us to do  but that's just puerto rican style she's not like a total jerk or anything especially with me because she doesn't want me to be sensitive or wimpy and she doesn't want me to let my trauma take over me she always looking out for me but she's not the most sensitive but she's a good to honest hard-working loving mother my dad still to this day regularly he criticize us he will strike us he will yell at us almost screaming sometimes when we have to clean and we dont do well enough or fast he will throw everything off either like a table or a dresser a desk on the floor making a huge mess breaking whatever he wants no matter who paid for it  I have been punched out of my actual seat for having bad grades back in high school  there are days still where he will quite literally search for anything to fight about with my mom or us and he'll go off the rails just because he wants to start fights we don't know why he does it or if we're particularly nice to him he'll be really really mean and ironically he's much nicer when he's not sober he wants to be a good dad and he says he wants to be a good dad but as drunk as he and as sincere he sounds  he's really not doing his part on trying my mother and him have gone back and forth back and forth trying to get a divorce but they never end up breaking it off  and we're back at square one again her blood sugar goes really high when she stressed out and after that she fights she's super weak and there are some days where she can't even get out of bed and he won't do anything to help her he just acts like it's this regular thing and I or one of my siblings have to take care of her or she refuses to be taken care of and just gets up and does whatever she needs to do he's also been times where my brother has been at the hospital and when he gets overwhelmed he doesn't know what to do so he just disappears and drinks and my mom is left to take care of everything on her own despite having her own very serious problems and these are more current things that have been happening
Whenever I talk about my trauma my dad always rushes it off his shoulder like it's means absolutely nothing like it's non-existent like nothing ever happened despite being there for everything I'm just wait seeing me suffer despite knowing what kind of person he is meeting him and talking to him he says it's all in the past in that it means absolutely nothing in that I'm fine and it's my fault and all the stuff and everyone blames me like it's my fault and yes even though I did stay in the relationship at the time that is constantly the fight and it makes me really hurt and angry because he doesn't know what I really went through he wasn't in my body he didn't experience what I experienced but I know that he's quite similar to him so it's hard for him to talk about it when he treats my mom like s*** and he treats us like s*** when given the chance
 cutting this short, they're very in a rush for me to move out and unfortunately I am nowhere ready to move out but I am desperate to move out I also want to seek help for my mental help but I am only allowed to share my abuse with my ex-boyfriend from freshman year I'm not allowed to share anything regarding my family life and I know it's something that needs to be said but I don't know what to do I'm not allowed to get medicated and my anxiety has been affecting me since school and since I've been working and honestly my workplace is more supportive to meet then they are which is really saying something and I keep being told that I need to bottle up these feelings and I can't do this and I can't do that at work because I could get fired and I know I can but being told otherwise by my bosses so I don't really know who to believe in the situation 
I'm afraid for therapists to hear something like this because I feel like my siblings are going to be taken away from my parents and maybe one of them might get locked up or something and I really don't ever want that to happen because I truly do love them both and they don't deserve that I don't know if I'm supposed to blame myself or or what I don't know I don't know what to do what to think but it's always been like this
 a few of my relationships after dating him were on the brink of abusive just disrespect and belittling but I cut it off real quick and have improved a bit 
I feel as though a lot of my 'kinks' derive from my trauma especially
I'm into BDSM subdom relationships, S&amp;M, humiliation, being assaulted during sex, degradation, ( almost cant get off with out it) petplay, choking, etc. 
Despite liking these things very much I'm very hyper-sensitive, shy, introverted, and have a low pain tolerance etc. 
So yeah I literally dont know where to start. Im 19 basically live in a snow globe and am currently learning to drive and the only reason I havent killed myself yet is fear of hell, trying to fulfill my spiritual destiny and not wanting to hurt the people I love if I die, what do",helpls2000,2019-04-25 11:57:17,2,2178,16.44,49.82,40.21,5.85,94.7,15.06,93.11,62.67,23.23,18.23,9.04,1.15,0.05,7.48,0.51,5,3.4,13.59,9.64,6.93,9.04,2.75,18.73,3.17,1.65,2.48,0.6,1.47,6.01,2.07,3.9,0.51,1.7,0.51,15.61,1.74,0.41,2.16,6.61,14.37,1.93,2.25,1.74,3.26,2.16,4.82,2.39,0.55,0.73,0.87,2.62,0.78,1.1,0.37,0.32,8.36,3.4,1.06,2.43,1.15,0.6,5.23,11.34,0.96,12.95,1.47,6.47,5.51,1.24,1.1,0.87,0.09,0.18,0.41,0.6,0.23,0,0.28,0.09,0,7.67,0.92,1.01,0.14,0.05,0.05,0,0.23,0.55,3.31,0.37,1.06

bhco5c,"Trying to move away, unsure how!","In a dilemma, maybe it’s not as big as I am putting it to be, but I am SO scared and nervous and constantly questioning if I am making the right choice! 

I made the decision to move over 600 miles, where I have no family or friends, to get far far away from my abuser but I am unsure how to handle the moving truck! 

Our vehicle is too wide that most moving truck companies don’t have a dolly to fit it. Thankfully I found one but it’s nearly $1000. On top of that I have two young, carseated, kids. Would it even be safe to put them in the front of a moving truck and hitch the car to be pulled on the dolly? Or ask my father, who I have no relationship with to help? He’d drive the moving truck and us in the car, but I’d be paying double gas&amp; I am unsure how he’d get back to our city too.

bhqohy,Please let her be gone for good,"Likely I'll delete this post, but I'm shaky as hell and gotta put this somewhere so it doesn't rattle around in my brain too much.

To start, I'm a guy, 45, 6'2"", white. She's black, 5'8"" - PTSD from childhood trauma with BiPolar and Borderline Personality Disorder, severe alcoholic and addiction issues. Married for 15 years, ended and filed a month ago, the week after she moved out.

15 years of ongoing abuse. I've been bitten, hit, kicked, scratched and torn till I bled, punched, and beaten with a 15lb silver tray so hard the handle broke off. After she decided she didn't need the anti-psychotics anymore, when she wasn't physically attacking me, she'd be screaming at the ceiling at people she hadn't seen in 15 years. Then she'd just start screaming at me - the most horrible, racist, abusive, vulgar, insane crap I'd ever heard in my life. For a while, she thought that Obama was spying on her and trying to rape her. It was like conspiracy Tourettes.

She's had restraining orders, court ordered anger management, court ordered medication, and nothing has worked. She's gone to jail because of it, talked her way out of mental wards, and promised a million times to change. A million lies.

And now she's gone. Or so I thought. 

Yesterday she shows up, doesn't knock, barges into the house. I manage to talk her back outside, give her some money to leave, tell her she can't come back and that she's trespassing. She throws a suitcase at me and starts screaming and crying. Then she takes her top off.

O fuck no. I'm so not dealing with this.

In 5 seconds flat I'm back in the house, lock the door, call the cops. They're there fast, and find her sitting on the porch, smoking a bowl. It's the fourth time they've had to visit in a year. 

Have to give props to them, and the really kind 911 operator who stayed with me on the call. I was pretty much in full blown panic attack - heart racing, trouble breathing. 

I know the cop who came in and spoke to me didn't quite know what to think - why a big guy like me was terrified. Hell, I was a full head taller than him. But I knew how crazy and irrational she could be - for a long time, I had refused to drive her anywhere because she had a tendency to try to jump out of the car when she got angry. 

When the crazy switch flips on for her, it's the kind of crazy that will burn the whole world down. It has no regard for her safety or others. 

But thank god the cop got it. He began to understand as I explained. He gave me the option to have her arrested, but I just needed her gone. 

I know she's sick. I know that what was done to her in her childhood was horrible and broke her in ways that can never be fixed. I know that there is a small part of her that loves me - if for nothing else than my dedication to our marriage for 15 years. 

But I'm certain now that if I let her back into my life, she'll kill me. 

We stopped sleeping in the same bed months ago. I woke up one night to find that she had a knife in hand, and had stabbed herself in the leg. 

She was looking at me like she had decided to stab herself rather than me.

I got her cleaned up as best I could - she refused to go to the doctor, said it had been an accident.

After that, I slept on the couch next to the phone and front door. 

....

Sorry, scattered,  I know. She's gone now - the cops took her someplace and gave her an official stay away order. I tried to make it to the courthouse today to file a DV restraining order, but I'm so damn shaky I can't breathe. Hell, couldn't even make it into work - didn't sleep at all.

Just thanking God that she's gone and that the kids were at their grandparents. Thanking God that I reacted fast enough before she did real damage this time.

bhrwjb,Anyone else 34F survive a break up with a deadbeat or abusive ex 32M? What's your advice for getting closure/your money back?,"Sorry, for length. Original posted in r/relationships but then found this subreddit

Well, the age doesn't matter but this was an eleven year *unmarried* relationship and requires a bit of back story. My ex beat me up; I didn't press charges because I didn't want to destroy him and we have a lot of shared debt in only my name. During and even after things ended, he promised to make good on this part and now has changed his mind without explanation. I want to know if anyone has had a similar experience when it comes to civil charges, court, public opinion, etc. I'm at a crossroads where I don't know what the high road is and wondering if anyone else has lived through something similar if you care to read the novel that follows...

Let's call my ex Beef. We met when Beef was in college, I had just moved to NY and couldn't afford school, been working full time since I was 19. He had a rich family, got a music degree, but was sure his connections were going to pay off and he'd be a successful engineer or audio something in NYC after college. The idea was then it'd be my turn to work part time and ultimately go to school. That wasn't a condition of our relationship though; we were young, in love and he was my first of everything. We were sure everything would be great forever and basically considered ourselves married. For the first few years, even after he was done with college, his family continued to provide a lot of support to him, but by our 7th year together, he was barely earning an income freelance and convinced we needed to live IN the city to be successful, but couldn't really afford it. We entered an expensive lease with his only friend who would consider sharing a tiny three bedroom in Brooklyn with a couple and two dogs (he was a devastated alcoholic who's GF had just left him) and this was a terrible turn for our relationship. Beef made almost no money, we were in over our heads, and things became toxic. We convinced a mutual friend of many years to come and take over the lease for the disastrous roommate, but the situation remained volatile and within two months our fighting was so intense that he was ready to bail. Beef had started taking Adderall about 6 mos before our city move, we were both drinking more, and he couldn't even pay the rent without handouts from his father, which meant 100% of all of our other costs of living was on me for weeks and sometimes months at a time.

One day, during a loud argument, our friend/roommate witnessed Beef hitting me repeatedly in the head (not hard if it matters) until I screamed that I'd call the police if he didn't stop, and our friend physically stepped in to pull him away.   Then, a week a later, the dude quite rationally said ""Hey guys, I'm sorry you have to deal, but f--k this. I'm out.""  In retrospect it was completely reasonable but at the time it felt like he was screwing us over financially and added to the turmoil. Shortly after that, under even more intense financial strain and what I saw as crumbling mental stability over his ex-best friends accusations of being a so called ""wife-beater,""  Beef *did* seriously hurt me, for the first time. He chased me down in the hallway, slammed furniture into me, threw me into a shut door hard enough to break it, while bruising my back and slamming my head into a wall.  Covered in bruises on my ribs and legs, I had promised myself I wouldn't be one of ""those"" women, and I broke up with him the next day.

Unfortunately, my resolve didn't last long.  After all, we'd had seven good years before this sudden hell, his family was my family, he was my partner, my life was in New York with him.  He was also utterly financially and emotionally dependent on me at this time, had almost no income and had just lost his best friend under terrible terms. And in this make or break moment we chose to hide and absorb whatever costs – both financially and emotionally – staying together and in that apartment entailed, rather than force his dad's responsibility on the remaining 13k of lease (he'd signed as guarantor for Beef specifically because he was the only one without proof of income). We hid from the truth of the situation itself, from his family, my mom, and our other friends. Instead, we sobbed for hours and held each other, while Beef promised that even though he didn't deserve a second chance, his only reason for living was to someday make it up to me, agreed to get help or anger management therapy (neither happened). He “bought me” a replacement for the computer he put his foot through on my own Discover card, while I spackled and painted the holes in the walls and door to get our security deposit back.  We incurred thousands in credit card debit (all in my name of course) during these few months living roommate-less and in another NYC move when that lease expired.

 \*On a side note, you should also know that Beef has consistently threatened since then, and in truly disturbing detail, to murder this roommate, his former best friend of nine years. He blames him for the issues in our relationship, still refusing to take responsibility for himself.

 Stemming from that initial incident above, our relationship was not as easily repaired as the damages to the apt.  Beef continued his downward spiral in terms of drinking, Adderall dependence, and inability to meet his basic financial obligations\*.\*  I think the guilt, shame, and resentment from that point on created a chasm of imbalance that would eventually swallow us up, and every attempt I made at encouraging his financial responsibility or getting therapy was generally shut-down by his own admissions that he was ""a piece of shit who ought to kill himself.""  Try ""winning"" that argument, which is at its heart, a form of emotional control. 

There was a brief period of hope during 2016 when his parents (who had no idea about anything other than his trouble finding work) encouraged and paid for him to do Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but he ultimately stopped and slipped into what I think was full blown alcoholism by early 2017. Though the jobs had finally started to pick up for him, by that Fall I felt I had no other choice and asked him, not even to end the relationship, but to a least separate to get some space on the financial entanglement and his alcohol use.  He interpreted that idea as a death blow to the relationship, and said that if we were over, he just have to find our old roommate (who we hadn't had any communication with in years at this point) , slit his throat, and then kill himself. This, while simultaneously saying he was never more sure he wanted to marry me, life had no meaning without me, and that he would never give up on “us” or even begin to hear rational talks about finalizing a split.

 I felt I couldn't leave and he wouldn't go. I hid on the internet looking for ways out of the relationship, emotionally hostage while he was unwilling to participate with any talks for how to handle our finances/dogs/apt, etc. He then started drinking nearly 100% of the time (even at work), right up until August of 2018 when another capricious turn ensued. He met another woman and this crush gave him a whole new perspective of life beyond our relationship. Beef, who literally 72 hours before this change of heart was still guilt tripping me with the ""I'll ALWAYS be here for you"", encouraging me to quit my job and go to culinary school if we could just work things out... said he was suddenly ready to hit eject on the relationship and NOW. He agreed that not only were we currently in an unhealthy place, but acted as though I had been a harpy for years and he’d only just realized he was always miserable in the relationship, couldn't do this anymore, et cetera. He said we could go to therapy or mediation at least once or twice for some guidance on working through what was essentially a divorce that hadn't even begun, but even lied about making the appointment. The result of suddenly ending things in such a frantic and contrary manner, after months of me begging for and being denied a peaceful and adult exit strategy, was catastrophic.  One devastating night, this conflict came to a very nasty head and he beat me up, again. He choked me, threw me to the ground, and then dragged my body weight by my hair while repeatedly punching and kicking me, yelling ""Is this what you wanted?!"" 

I know what he tells other people happened that night, but the truth is much more horrific. There are photos. And a police report. And a report from my doctors.

 Beef, who was very drunk at the time, says he “overreacted” but he is in denial about the entire event. When I ask him about times he was violent before that, such as the aforementioned events in our first NYC share(for which he was sober, btw), his only answer is to say “we had a deeply flawed relationship”.

Though I called the cops and he was ultimately arrested, I didn't assist the DA in pressing criminal charges against Beef last year for two reasons, which I'm told are common in cases of domestic violence.  For one, I still loved him and didn't want the weight of the potential consequences to him for his own actions to rest on my conscience. That one was painful but hard to argue when confronted by my own mother's, and the polices', ""Yeah, but what about your conscience when he takes no responsibility and does this to *someone else* down the road? What happens if he has a weapon then?""  Secondly, he still owed me a crippling amount of money, given my new living situation and limited options for getting out of it.  I honestly believed that my cooperation with his lawyer to end the imminent threat of criminal repercussions was the only way to expedite healing and moving-on, without leaving him ruined or incarcerated, and in an obvious position to recant his previous promises regarding the debt owed.  Then there was an EPO preventing any contact with him for months of the aftermath; an extremely traumatic and abrupt end followed by total stasis.

If you made it all the way to this point... In the end, both the criminal charges and EPO against him expired in January. After that, he seemed to intent to make good on his promise but has recently had a change of heart and is now hard ghosting me without any explanation why. He's already denied the reality of our life together and what he did to me on both an emotional and physical level, and now I'm left wondering if this is an attempt at control, retaliation, or him simply trying to re-write history to avoid responsibility or admit wrongdoing. I have no idea why he'd go from promising to pay me as recently as March, to suddenly refusing even his father's generous offer to assist him with a loan to resolve the debt in one shot. I'm left with either civil court for who knows what cost or gain for me (rent, mental health bills, damages beyond the amount he promised to pay) or soaking up the remaining loss and at least being able to put this behind me asap and burn whatever bridges making the details public would cause. In reality, the amount of support I've provided to him over the years is in the tens of thousands to be sure, this was just the agreed remaining half of the revolving debt under cards in my name which he considered to be his self-professed ""student loans"". I get the short end of the stick no matter what, so I'm wondering it's healthier to just accept this addition to my tally for being a fool, stop trying to get any settlement, even if I could succeed, and have the freedom to admit what he is to our decade worth of shared friends family social circles etc. To make matters worse, the asshole moved out just two blocks away in my same neighborhood, still talks to my neighbors, frequents all the closest bars/shops in proximity to my residence for his whole new lifestyle (which is mostly spending all his money on expensive tattoos, alcohol and tinder dates), and has a history of violence and threatening violence to people for years outside their perceived wrongs could have any meaningful effect on his life. He shouldn't be allowed to get away with this and set up shop next door in an alternative version of reality; to emotionally manipulate, physically abuse, take financial advantage of someone and then move into their immediate proximity because he doesn't want to find a new bartender- sacrificing nothing, answering to no one. Pretend to all our friends and family that our relationship didn't end the way it did, he isn't what he is, while attending public work conventions (he's now a voice actor and super active about progressive views on social media to boot!). The money is the only reason I still have to consider him, but it's not really the core issue. If he'd just pay me, I'd try my best to pretend he didn't exist... instead I feel like there's this secret that everyone should know about and only I continue to deal with the repercussions. He fucked me over, lied, hurt me, and got off free from everything he did.

I agreed to keep the dog (which costs as much per month in walkers and food as his rent, lol) and cannot afford to relocate on my own, but my railroad apartment doesn't really work with a non-couple roommate and things are extremely tight for me. I know dollar amounts are different to everyone, but the total he agreed to pay amounts to about 1/3 of all my debt, and would take me a least another year and a half of extremely lean living to it pay off. So it would be hard. I'm still very close to his sisters, still have many shared friends, but this is fucked up. I feel there is so much to gain and lose from however I proceed from here, but I need to make a decision to get on with my life at this point. A large part of me really just wants some kind of validation, whether it's a court judgement or social opinion, and make him ashamed to show his face around here. I might not win my money back, but at least I can tell my truth and not need anything from him, hide anything, nor subject myself to more stress and strain while a legal battle plays out. I will think I will survive either way, but I need some form of closure and a definite path forward to take actions in my best financial or emotional interest.

bi6qln,"Friend in dangerous situation, don't know what to do. (Will delete this shortly for their safety)","I'm trying to help a friend who is in a terrible position, and I don't know what to suggest. I'll try to keep this short.

My friend has been with this person for a long time, and that person has consistently been abusive(Hitting, controlling, stalking, name it and it's happened). It's gotten so bad that this person has finally decided to open up about it. 

My friend is being forced daily to take mental, physical, and emotional abuse. She must listen to the abusers every demand or they will hit my friend. They share a home, but outside of that the abuser stalks her CONSTANTLY, and I mean CONSTANTLY monitoring her every movement. They have kids together, and on several occasions has told my friend that if they try to leave (the abuser) will kill everyone. 

My friend suggested divorce, and the abuser beat her up for it.

The abuser forces my friend to have sex.

I suggested that my friend record their conversation with the abuser.... They tried to record a conversation, but their phone made a beep.. causing the abuser to take the phone and see that my friend was trying to record the abuser... the abuser then beat the shit out of my friend.

My friend cannot leave because they don't want to abandon their children. My friend is worried about even getting custody because, after many years of abuse, the kids have adopted some of the abusers traits and regularly hit my friend.. as well as yell/say the worst things possible. That has led my friend to believe that if they get custody, the children will contact the abuser to reveal information such as my friends/the kids location. 

My friend is also worried that if the abuser does go to jail for whatever reason, the abuser will be released and come to kill her. My friend is quite certain that the abuser will come after them and their children.

The violence is getting worse, and if nothing is done it is only a matter of time until he kills her and the children. 

I know that the police are the best to handle this.. but I don't know what evidence my friend needs to collect in order to be safe.

bi9xvf,Do you still dream of your ex abuser?,"I had a horrible dream last night were I was sexually assaulted by my abusive ex partner (not something he ever did irl). 

He was very very emotionally and verbally abusive but never physically.

We split over two years ago now and I am with a wonderful partner now who couldn't be more different to him.

But he still regularly appears in my dreams. Sometimes I am taken from my current partner or manipulated back to my ex and I am stuck with him unable to escape. Sometimes it is just running into him somewhere and very occasionally it is him being nice and apologising for how he was with me.

bip77l,My boyfriend put his hands on me for the first time last night,"My boyfriend did something last night and I don't know how to move on or process it. I know I should cut it off, but more than anything I want his comfort more right now. He's driving over now. I feel so weak for asking for him but I don't know who else to turn to. He also broke my phone by accident during the altercation.

The full story is embarrassing. We decided we wanted to try having a threesome and invited a girl from Tinder over to see where things went. There was some ambiguity, but she knew that hooking up was on the table and that he and I were more than friends, and him and I decided to see how it went, and if nothing happened, we would at least all have fun together. She ended up leaving around 3 a.m., while I was in the bathroom. No threesome happened. Him and I were upset with how each other handled interacting with her but were poker facing it in front of her. While I was in the bathroom, I heard him talking normally to her and I didn't think he was super drunk. When I came out of the bathroom in the bedroom, he was sitting on his bed with his legs crossed waiting for me. He began yelling at me and I yelled back and we were arguing. I went to pack my bags to leave and came back in the bedroom to grab my phone charger. He grabbed me and held my arms to my body and shoved me down on the bed and then got on top of me. He held me down, and then pinned my arms under his knees and told me it would be easy for him to kill me if he wanted to, but that he's not that evil of a person.

I was struggling and begging for him to get off of me as he called me names and was saying a bunch of things. Then he picked me up slightly off the bed and threw me to the ground off his bed. I hit my face and have a swollen spot/light bruise. My phone screen cracked completely and is now unusable. He continued to yell at me for about three hours. I begged and pleaded and argued with him back. He pushed his body up against me several times but made a point to hold his hands away from his body and was making comments like ""See cops, I didn't lay a hand on her!"" For reference, we are both the same height and he is about 30 pounds heavier than me. He berated me and started playing mean songs and telling me that they all were about me. He told me that he has been ""dealing with me at a level 4 brain, but level 5 brain was aware of all of my manipulation and victim playing and level six brain always had an eye on everything and wouldn't allow it anymore"". At one point he blasted music and began jumping around dancing energetically and going on a rant about how horrible I was for tricking him into dating him, and so on and so forth. That I was \*lucky\* that he loved me, that at least I had that going for me. At one point, I begged him to fuck me just to try to pull him back and calm him down. I’m ashamed of this.

This morning he acknowledged what he did and apologized but then brushed past it very quickly and focused on what I did wrong. I don't know where to go from here. I know the smart thing is to leave and move on but I have no one else.

TL;DR: My boyfriend, whom I've known for 2 years, blew up on me after a failed threesome/our communication during it. We argued and he got physically abusive for the first time ever. I know I should go, but I lost most of my community lately and am embarrassed to explain to those I'm close with. How do I fight the urge to let him make it right/make me feel better? This seemed so out of character and I don't know how to process this.",GullibleExample,2019-04-29 05:59:30,10,730,33.67,46.71,77.23,7.06,18.25,11.78,94.25,62.6,23.29,18.36,10.27,0.96,0,6.99,0.14,4.93,3.84,16.16,7.26,4.66,10.14,1.51,19.18,3.97,2.19,1.78,1.64,1.92,4.93,1.64,3.29,0.82,1.37,0.41,13.29,0,0.55,0.96,6.58,11.1,2.74,1.78,1.51,1.64,1.1,3.15,3.42,0.82,1.37,1.23,3.01,2.05,0.55,0.14,0.14,7.67,2.47,1.23,3.56,0.68,0.27,8.36,7.53,0.82,17.81,3.29,9.45,5.75,0.14,1.51,1.23,0.14,0,0.14,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,11.64,5.34,2.6,0.14,0.14,0.14,0.14,0,0.55,1.64,0,0.96
bipjma,He got arrested. Again.,"Why?

Why do I keep going back to him?

I don’t even know where this post is going to go but need someone to just listen. 

We were drinking two nights ago. A lot. We fought. He tried taking my purse. My house key. My blood pressure meds. The police were called. Nothing happened. We continued to drink and argue. He pushed me. I hit my eye/head on the side of the couch. At that point, I’d had enough, room my purse and ran outside. There were cops out there for another reason but they saw my bleeding and crying face and stopped me. 

They took pictures and a statement. They asked if they could go into my apartment and talk to him. I said they could but.... I had to retrieve my house key.... from my vagina. Yes, that’s what it has come to. And yes it was very humiliating to stand behind a car and stick my hand down there in front of 2 male officers. 

He had snuck out the back door. The officers asked if I felt safe staying here for the rest of the night. It was 3am by then. I did stay. He showed up awhile later. Pissed off. Saying that he couldn’t believe I called the cops. He went to sleep for a bit as he had to work at 6am. 

Here’s where I get even more stupid. 

He went to work. Still angry and drunk. I got a call around 7 from the police. They’re going to go to his work and arrest him is what I was told. 

I fucking called him to let him know that he needed to leave work immediately. He said that he couldn’t. His boss wouldn’t let him. I was like no for real, you’re going to jail if you don’t leave. Sure enough, an hour later he texted me to say that he was in jail. 

In my city, you have 24-48 hours time in which you can be arrested for a domestic charge. After that, it’s just... over. No warrants or anything. It’s also up to the city to press charges. The victim can’t ask them not to. Just to clarify some things there. 

I have no job. 2 dollars cash. Rent is due and luckily I can pay that online using his debit card number. I don’t have the actual card so I can’t buy food. My ex is giving me 100 bucks today sometime so I can stretch that out for awhile. I talked to my abuser/bf/whatever and promised that I wouldn’t lose this apartment and make sure his boss knew what was going on... but that was it and I was done. That I’m going to move in with my mom and creepy stepdad. I’m 40! Moving to my moms omfg. 

I’ve been beaten terribly by him in the past. Black eyes. Broken bones. For his first offense, they wanted 5000 dollars. All cash. For bail. I don’t even know what they’re going to want this time, even though I just have a scrape on my cheek. I was severely beaten the first time. I don’t know. And yes he has strangled me. 

I just don’t know what to do, you guys. Oh, when I talked to “him”, he asked if I wanted to be with him still. And you know what I said? Yes. Then he said “We need to stop drinking” and I said I was more than willing to (I’ve been trying for a long time but it’s hard with another drinker). I said of course I’d stop, if he would also get help to stop. 

I don’t even know what I’m going on about anymore. Reality is setting in. I don’t know how I’m going to keep my apartment. I am angry but I don’t want him to lose his job or home. I’ll definitely go to my moms but there’s that little part of me that thinks it can be ok if we try. I’m so lonely already and the thought of moving to the middle of nowhere an hour away just kills me. 

There’s a 90 day waiting list for the domestic violence home. I don’t know what I can do. I don’t want to leave the city but I also don’t really want to die. I don’t think.

birkkm,Was I Abusive?,"So I am going to try and include all relevant information and opinions in this situation and try to represent any side as objectively as I can. My wife has BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) which if you don't know what that is I would suggest looking it up and posting any questions you have about it below because it is kind of complicated and would be hard to explain everything.  So on the day this even happened I was laying in bed after recently getting off work because I was very very tired. I hadn't been able to get enough sleep recently and I was out of my medicine for the past few days which dramatically decreases my energy when I just randomly stop taking it (side note she didn't know about this part until afterward so don't assume she knew that going into it). She comes in from work and lays down with me and thinks something is wrong because I am not talking much. I tell her that I am really tired and just want to sleep. She replies saying something along the lines of thinking that I wanted her to leave and asking if we could cuddle (don't remember the exact words as my memory wasn't super good on the situation right here because I was very tired.). I tell her no she can stay and we can cuddle I am just too tired to do anything. I am partially asleep and she starts saying to me can I at least have a hug and a kiss. This is a simple request and nothing is wrong with asking that but based off the phrasing and how I know she is that just makes me jump to my first thought which is that most of the time in these situations that she starts going on after that saying I don't love her I don't care about her then I have to argue the point that I do I am just (insert whatever the legitimate reasons for my actions are). In this case, I am really really tired and instead of thinking through what I am saying I say no or something along those lines. She gets understandably hurt by this because I should have just done that because yeah it is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask but I didn't reason out my answer as I should have. She then starts to get very angry and yelling quite a bit and I can't even take in what she is saying but I then reply somewhere in the startup of her yelling that I am not dealing with this right now/today(forgot which word it was). I felt very disrespected and unappreciated considering we had gone through a rough patch about a month prior where she had this long list of everything she didn't like that I did and wanted me to change and I apologized for what I did and said I would do better and I did. She told me many times how happy she was with everything and all the effort I put in for her. This was a lot especially given her struggles this means many many conversations spanning days and leaving me to deal with lack of sleep and a large emotional stress to try and deal with the things she will say and do at times when she gets into certain thought patterns and me trying to treat everything with the appropriate level of value. So when after I am trying my heart out to make sure my actions convey the love I have for her and she doesn't even want to give me the time to sleep at that moment I felt very very disrespected and undervalued. She absolutely loses it after that point and I can't handle it at the moment as I had said (I could have said it in a much nicer way.) so I then put my earphones in and try to drown her out by turning the volume to the max but she is screaming so loud at me that even with the volume so loud that it is hurting my hear and me covering my ears over the earphones I can still hear her. I try to turn around to get away from it because she is flailing around with her arms trying to get me to listen but then she goes to the other side of the bed where I am facing. I then turn around again and the same thing happens. She then I close my eyes and tug the comforter over me and she tries to make me listen my climbing partially onto the bed and over top of me and fight me trying to rip the sheets off of me and the headphones out of my ears and she freaks me out right here because she is being very very aggressive and I am tired and overwhelmed and confused and I probably misread the situation so I then use my foot to push her off of me. Now I feel like the details of this part, in particular, is important. I did not use much force just enough to get her off of me. I didn't cause her to be bruised or thrown back into the wall or be injured because I was tired and it was a weak push but I also didn't have any goal to cause her harm I just got freak out and felt like I really needed her off of me. She basically got pushed back enough so that she had to take her knee that was on the bed off the bed to stabilize herself but not so much that she couldn't and then fell over. So then she screams more and cries and finally leaves in a storming off fashion then while she is gone starts spamming my phone with how I am abusive and awful and that I attacked her. So basically what I am asking/ saying is that I can see her side and how I messed up and hurt her feelings I wasn't thinking right or enough and replied/responded badly but I really don't believe I was beating her up or attacking her or being physically abusive and I know that wasn't my intention. So I would like some third party opinions to help me know whether you guys would consider my behavior physically abusive or anything. Thank you for taking the time to read this all because it is long.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in a relationship with my SO for 5 years. He has had a history of emotional abuse but we've worked through it.

He has never physically harmed me, but there's always been a worry in the back of my mind. However, last week he called me and described in detail how he would kill me if ""I ever betrayed him"".

I'm not sure if he was kidding or not (he's a dark humor type), and I'm not in a spot where I can disappear. Nor do I want to tell anyone, as I dont want to ruin his life on the chance he was just kidding.

Basically, I need some advice on how to stay safe.

biyzfu,Broke up after 5 years,"Me (37m) and my ex (29m) just recently called it quits after a long relationship. We were great together, but definitely had some little communication issues that most relationships have. Over the 5 years, there were 6 isolated incidents were we got physical with each other after excessive drinking. They were more of pushing and shoving and screaming at each other. In those handful of events, 2 times it escalated quick and punches were thrown. Not to downgrade it, but it was always a quick fight that ended and it was it. 

I always focused on the positives of our relationship and after these 6 fights, I tried to forgive and forget. I grew up in a house where “loving each other” sometimes escalated to physical abuse and I never wanted to accept it. I would wake up the next morning and briefly talk about what happened and hope he was also able to forgive and forget. 

The last event was a month ago and has left an imprint on my life. We argued on a Saturday, he left the follow Thursday. After we talked and he said he was moving out, I fully agreed that it needed to be done and we both needed to figure this shit out. We have hung out a couple of times since and stayed in contact. I personally know that changes need to me made - and I am fully focused on making them. I have a therapy appointment set up and want to discuss this situation and my upbringing as a child. I am dedicated to making myself better and figuring out what the underlying issues I have. 

My Ex was not perfect and has admitted that this was an “us” issue and not just one him or myself. He struggles with emotions and has a hard time processing these events over the years.  

I feel horrible because my forgive or forget was not the right approach to dealing with these issues, but only added it to the situation.  

Does excessive alcohol, mix with emotions and physical violence make either one of us an abuser?  Are we both abusers?  With the dedication to change on both ends, can we start a new relationship with each other?",clyde1128,2019-04-29 21:07:50,0,378,56.91,62.46,87.07,21.7,16.43,16.67,90.74,56.61,17.72,10.58,5.56,2.91,0,1.59,0.53,7.14,6.08,13.49,7.67,3.17,8.2,1.32,16.67,5.56,2.91,0.79,1.85,3.44,7.14,3.17,3.44,0.53,1.85,0.53,11.11,0,0.26,0,1.59,12.43,2.38,2.12,1.85,1.59,1.59,3.7,1.32,0,0.53,0.79,2.38,0.53,1.59,0,0.53,9.26,4.76,0.79,2.12,1.85,0,9.26,6.88,0.26,19.58,2.91,8.47,8.73,0,0.53,0.26,0,0,0,0.79,0.26,0,0,0,0,10.85,5.03,2.65,0,0,0.79,0,0.26,1.06,0,1.06,0

bj06ie,I’ve realized I have had this thing where I have to be completely honest to him despite it being bad for me?,"I’m proud of myself today. I made a secret email and have been recording things finally. I can actually do so much now that I’m keeping this secret, but why did I wait so long?

I used to be scared that he tracked my keystrokes and stuff and he used to do random phone inspections all the time. He tracked my gps and said he could track my text messages but I think he was bluffing because a common thing that comes up in big arguments is him asking me if I ever deleted messages. 

I did delete some once, because it was our friend and I trying to plan a birthday surprise for him. He brought it up in an argument, and I guess I thought he was testing me so I told him the truth, that I did delete some and gave away the surprise in the process of trying to defend myself. He still didn’t believe me; he believed I was deleting messages but he thought it was because I was cheating and not because of the surprise. That told me that he couldn’t really track my messages, and that was years ago.

I guess because he calles me a liar so much and even sometimes convinced me that I’m lying without realizing it, so I thought I had to be 100% honest with him at all times, trying to prove to him and myself that I’m not the lying manipulative monster he makes me out to be. I think that’s called projecting. 

Anyway, he has calmed down a lot in the past few years. I’ve been trying really hard to be good, and although I still get in trouble a lot and still have to give him sex to keep him happy, he has let his guard down a lot. 

He doesn’t check my phone all the time, only when he’s mad. I’m careful to only use it when he’a Asleep or showering or something so I don’t get caught.

 I’ve been selectively deleting history, messages, and now hiding an email and I’ve been terrified to do all of this for the last 2 years since he calmed down and I’m just proud that I’m kinda starting to think for myself more now. 

I think I thought that if I were always honest that he would love me like he’s supposed to, and I thought that if I hid stuff like this, then I really was the plotting wolf in sheep’s clothing that he thinks I am. I think this introspection means I’m starting to come out of the rabbit hole of the abuse and that I may have a chance still now that I’m starting to see that I can do things.

I’m thinking if I work really hard and stay really careful that I might be able to get out in a month or so.",Throw_n_thru,2019-04-29 23:40:58,1,504,7.15,23.15,80.64,22.69,25.2,13.29,94.44,65.87,26.79,19.44,13.1,0.2,0,6.15,0,7.34,4.76,10.52,13.1,6.55,8.93,1.39,24.01,3.17,0.6,0.79,0.6,2.58,4.96,2.38,2.58,0.4,1.59,0,11.31,0,0.2,0,6.15,17.06,4.17,2.58,1.39,5.16,1.79,4.37,1.19,0.2,0.6,0.4,0.6,0.2,0,0.2,0,7.34,1.59,1.98,1.39,0.79,1.59,6.94,13.89,0.79,12.1,0.99,4.37,6.75,0.4,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0.4,0,0.2,0,0,0.2,11.9,3.57,2.98,0,0.2,0.4,0,0,0,4.56,0,0.2
bj0929,My good friend desperately needs help,"Very very long and unbelievable post and i am typing on mobile but here goes nothing. 


I have a good friend who is 18 and she is Dating someone who used to be a good friend of mine as well who is 17. I was good friends with the both of them and there were never any issues at all until he started to get progressively toxic and abuse in his relationship shutting off and becoming fake to me and everyone else who had contact with his girlfriend even people like me who have known him since 5th grade and been nothing but nice and accepting of him despite him being an extreme dick to almost every person he runs Into. This guy is no longer a good friend of mine for soon to be obvious reasons but his girlfriend still is one of my only friends and probably my best friend right now which he sees as an issue or a threat as well as any other male who his girlfriend chooses to have a conversation or hangout with 

My friend is in an almost one year relationship with this guy who in the past few months has turned extremely abusive, controlling, and threatening with physical force and physiological threats. Every single day he drags her down to a low level of the depression to the point where she told me today that she honestly feels like the only way out of her situation is suicide. 

I’m not entirely sure how this all even started because I remember a couple months ago hanging out with the couple and everything being completely fine but the more comfortable this guy got in the relationship the more controlling and morally disregarding of human emotions he became. It took her a while to open up to me about what was going on and it has now reached a point where it is unreal how severely terrible he treats her and how scared she is of him yelling at her or hitting her if she does anything to upset him. The thing about abusive relationships especially this one is that he seems to find any and every reason he can to justify his abuse and blames everything on her even after carrying out unimaginably acts of cruelty towards her for no reason at all besides his crippling self esteem and jealousy over her doing anything that isn’t texting or talking
to him. He has gotten so controlling, even though she has never done anything wrong or been anything but loyal in the relationship, that he now checks her phone every day, searches her bedroom when he is over, does not allow her to hang out with friends unless he is supervising, but even then he gets mad because he can’t stand to see her enjoy spending time with other people and then inevitably be miserable when she is with him, he does not let her use Snapchat because the messages disappear and he still gets fuming mad if people
Snapchat her when she is not even the one sending Snapchat’s, he gets angry if she doesn’t respond to his texts in less than a few minutes and he will without failure spam her with calls until she picks up so he can yell at her for “disregarding him in relationship and being a selfish useless whore” or text her that she is useless and that he should kill himself  because she isn’t responding quick enough to his messages. 

This dude has a long list of petty things that he has gotten extremely irrationally angry about some of which include the time at school when she didn’t wave back at him when he walked by and it caused him to get raging angry and threaten to break up with her, the multiple times at school every day where he calls her names like whore, skank, cheating bitch, for many many reasons including when she is talking to classmates instead of talking to him or texting him and simply when she is even talking to classmates because that makes him uncomfortable and he can’t trust her to have a conversation with other people at school. 

On top of him accusing her of cheating daily for no substantial reason and calling her cruel names constantly and in-front of other people he is the same person who literally cheated on her around 3 months into the relationship. He went behind her back and fucked another girl yet he still has the audacity to scream at her daily and lay his hands on her for his accusations of her being a useless cheating  whore despite her doing nothing to give him a reason not to trust her. This man literally cheated on her for a decently long amount of time and then when he got caught he blatantly lied to her about it claiming that it was only nudes which she just very recently found out was a complete lie when the girl that he cheated on her with texted her with screenshots of conversations. Not only did he cheat on her, lie about it, and then apologize profusely about how he fucked up and how he has never been so sorry and doesn’t know how he could even live with himself but he knows he can’t live without her, after all of this and after her for some reason taking him back he continued to cheat on her and fuck the same exact girl behind her back once they started dating again. So yea he probably wasn’t really that sorry if he kept cheating even after being caught and coughing up an apology full of pity. 

All of this but somehow In his eyes she is the cheating whore in the relationship who doesn’t care about his feelings. Which amazes me that he could even accuse of such a thing after cheating himself to that bad of an extend but I guess it goes to show his rationality. 

Cheating on anybody is an inhumane and emotionless thing to do to your significant other but what amazes me even more is that when she tries to confront him and explain how it still hurts her emotionally and self esteem wise he denies it being his fault and angrily blames her for him cheating on her. His logic is that it’s all her fault that he cheated since he only cheated because of her not giving him enough attention, which is complete bullshit and even if it wasn’t could never justify something like cheating on your partner especially for a reason of that magnitude. 

Recently the abuse has just been getting worse and worse escalating to the point where she can’t do anything at all without being extremely paranoid and fearful of him irrationally physically or verbally attacking her. She describes herself as numb at this point to most emotions and too terrified to do anything in fear of how he would react. I am a natural philosophical and deep thinking who people
Tend to trust soI am the only person that she has confided this Information in and that’s why I feel so conflicted given the severity of the problem and the hopelessness my good friend, who is such a nice and genuine person, has to go through every day being completely put down to a point of deep depression, fear, paranoia, anxiety, hopelessness, and complete loss of self esteem as a whole.  She is so terrified to do anything because he can’t control his emotions or anger at all and at this point anger, spite, and complete cruelty are the only emotions he expresses at all. He refuses to go to any therapy or treatment although he insists on her going and does not give her an option, he also has tried on multiple occasions to make her bring him Into her therapy sessions so that she can’t say anything bad about his abuse towards her to the therapist. He found out once that she was talking to the therapist about the fact that she was having relationships issues, not even about the abuse or Insane extend of it, and upon hearing this information he flipped out yelling at her for being an untrustworthy whore who doesn’t care about him, hates him, and apparently does anything In her power to ruin his life. All of that because she was talking to her therapist, who he Forces her to attend, about personal issues In her life. Correct me if I’m wrong but that’s kinda the point of a therapist. 

Including the 24/7 emotional abuse and mental drainage he has also started hitting and hurting her out of very nonexistent reasons and she now she can’t be with him alone without being utterly terrified because of the likelihood that he will get angry at some small things she does and shove her again, throw stuff at her again which he does frequently, one time even throwing a chair, grabbing her, choking her, spitting on her , simply hitting her, and making unwanted sexual advances on her despite her very frequent expression and explanation on how he makes her uncomfortable because of a past relationship where she was sexually used in a way she did not approve of  and because of the understandable fact that she does not want anything to do with him sexually when he is nothing but abusive although none of this  stops him as she describes his side of the relationship as only wanting sex while she is not comfortable or into it whatsoever. Today he even called her a pussy and a crybaby and started mocking her and Making fun of her for what happened to her when she was young that caused her to be sexually hesitant and uncomfortable while he was at the same time grabbing her in inappropriate places despite her not wanting it at all and despite him just getting
done screaming at her. 

She is far to scared to do anything about her situation because of the fear he has established and his nonstop blaming of his abuse onto her is causing her to start believing a lot of what he is saying since he has convinced her that he wouldn’t be so angry if she wasn’t such a terrible girlfriend. 

One of the big things that scares her about getting help or leaving him is from instances like the time he choked her because she was trying to get out of his car. He was driving like an absolute maniac while screaming at her, throwing things at her, and spitting on her when she eventually had enough and told him that she is getting out of the car. His reaction to this was to choke her with his arm and tell her “you’re not leaving me” before after enough crying and threatening to call the police he finally let her out of the car where ever they were stopped at and drove away. The choking is probably the worst it has gotten physically but that doesn’t excuse the frequent hitting and shoving, one time resulting in her having shoulder pain for a decent amount of time making it painful for her to drive. It also doesn’t excuse frequently throwing things at her and intimidating her using threats of harm. 

He is making constant threats about physically harming her and fabricating lies so that her friends and family will not trust her or like her anymore. These are very common and even in front of people like today in front of a group of my friends and I when he threatened to punch her. She is no longer is on speaking terms with her best friend either because for a month straight he went to both his girlfriend and his girlfriends best friend making up rumors that the two were saying negative and extremely hateful things about each other so that they would both think the other person hated them. He did this every day for a month and watched her cry in front of him upon hearing the terrible things her best friend was saying while he just sat there watching her bawl her eyes out to his made up rumors that he pushed into their heads because he was simply jealous of her spending time with her best friend instead of all her time with him. 

As well as the other threats there are also frequent threats along the lines of “don’t tell anybody about this, or else” and “if you tell anyone about this I’m going to make sure that all of your friends hate you.” 

He’s manipulative, cruel, inhumane, heartless, egotistically fucked up beyond belief, sociopathic, emotionally disconnected, untrustworthy, controlling, intimidating, and irrational in every aspect imaginable. 

He even lied when they agreed to quit juuling together earlier in their relationship to better the both of their healths but he instead got a new juul and hid it from her for 3 months while she became nicotine free thinking that he was going through the battle by her side. 

The repeatedly unreal part to me is how he can do this every single day and expect love, respect, and 100% of his girlfriends attention and human interaction, which are unrealistic expectations off the bat but even more illogical if you are holding someone on that high of a pedastool of expectation while still treating them like an emotionless material item that he deserves complete control over. 

He treats her like he has absolutely zero regard for human decency, respect, or emotional awareness and blames every single action of his on her for making him mad in the first place. It’s absolutely ridiculous and I honestly don’t know what to do I am constantly talking to my friend and texting her trying to assure her that she is not all the things he calls her and convinces her that she is and that this happens to many people but she is so hopeless and scared of him that she doesn’t see any way out of his abuse. 

She has tried countless times to sit him down or talk to him explaining that what he’s doing is not  okay and it is blatant abuse but he without hesitation tells her that it’s all her fault and that 
“If you want me to stop hitting you, you have to stop making me mad.” Which is not at all how relationships work considering there are plenty of ways to deal with minor bumps in relationships that aren’t physical assaulting and emotionally abusing your partner. 

I am forgetting so much regarding inhumane things he has done to her but I think this is enough to get the general idea of the situation.  The guy literally just has zero respect for anyone at all and believes that everybody is out to get him so if someone is nice to him it instantly means that they want something from him or have an evil interior motive for treating him kindly. I will be hanging out with my friend while he spends an hour straight just sending her nothing but angry texts and phone calls despite him knowing she is with friends. There was even an instance where her phone died while we were hanging out in a group of 4 her self Included so her boyfriend called this girls friends phone who was in the car with us and made him Give the phone to her so that he could yell and scream at her which resulted in her crying in the backseat of the car while we were just trying to get dinner and ice cream as a group of friends. Another extreme case of his irrational behavior and the last one I’m going to recollect on here was the entirety of today starting with a huge argument this morning where he was calling and texting her nonstop because she didn’t respond to his text fast enough even though it was 7:00 am and she was driving to school in the rain. When she got to school she looked at her phone and answered his spamming phone calls for him to furiously be asking where she is, who she is with, and why she is ignoring him. This was all at 7 something Monday morning so I don’t know where he thought she would be besides school or who he Thought she would be with but either way it caused him to be extremely mad and swiftly say “don’t talk to me” when she tried to greet him at school. With his attitude she didn’t exactly want to talk to him and he went a few hours without texting her after all the drama about her ignoring him although when the end of the day rolled by he was beyond pissed because she had “ignored him all day and left him to suffer on his own” and apparently for that she is a selfish skank and a useless girlfriend who’s only interest is to ruin his life. In the same exact conversation her little brother walked by and said something to which he told the kid off by calling him a “retarded dork” or something along those lines after the much younger kid had only asked him “are you okay.” This is the same kid who he yells at very frequently and backhanded on one occasion. 

The day only got worse today as those above events caused him to angrily text her about how she’s terrible to him and how he isn’t coming over to see her tonight because he is going to go home and ignore her to see how she likes it considering she was “intentionally” ignoring him in the morning and making him suffer. 

My friend was quite relieved that she didn’t have to see him because he was extra threatening and aggressive today so she decided to hang out with me and another friend for a little bit to pass the time at McDonald’s and driving around town. Well what happened was despite her boyfriends angry texts shaming her and declaring he won’t come over to her house she got a text while we were hanging out as a group telling her that’s he’s at her house. This was obviously unexpected considering his previous message but that didn’t matter to him he was fuming angrier than any of us had ever seen him regardless. He asks where she was loudly and repeatedly and then says some more hateful things while we are in sitting right in the car with her before telling her that he’s going home and that she shouldn’t talk to him. When this happened we were at a park in my town and after the call we were all a little bit amazed and horrified at his anger of the situation but decided to go to McDonald’s to eat some dinner and clear our minds. What happens next is we get to the McDonald’s parking lot and park when she starts getting more calls from him and when she answers he starts screaming at the top of his lungs, no exaggeration louder than I have heard anyone scream before, that she is a lying bitch on top of a few other things. She tried to explain that she isn’t a lying bitch only that we left the park that we were at, that he literally drove to in an attempt to hunt her down while she was with friend, but he countered her explanation with more screaming about her being a useless lying bitch. At this point he is screaming asking “where the fuck are you” still at the top of his voice when she ends the call out of fear and embarrassment for me and my friend witnessing this all happen. We go into McDonald’s and get some food while the entire time he is calling her and texting her demanding she sends Him her location on messenger and then started making threats about what he would do it she didn’t. At this point my friend and the rest of us at the table were terrified and in awe at his behavior but this guy ended up doing the only logical thing when your girlfriend won’t tell you where she is when you start screaming at her and he literally drove all the way back to her house to yell at her mom and complain about her daughter and how awful she is. Her mom obviously gets pissed that this dick bag who she already hates for so many reasons mainly him vaping in her house, calling her son the N word with a hard R while she was very much in earshot, and just being overall disrespectful towards the family. I also just can’t imagine her being joyed with an angry abusive nut case coming to her house on Monday night and demanding the location of her daughter.  Once my friends mom starts calling her about the situation she tells her boyfriend we are at McDonald’s where he arrives zooming into the parking lot in no time at all and storming out of his car towards the front door with the most scary and pissed off expression I’ve ever seen. He walks up to our table and starts demanding she go outside with him so that he isn’t causing a scene inside McDonald’s but she refuses out of fear and common sense when he grabs her phone and threatens her that he won’t go to prom and will tell her mom that’s it’s all her daughters fault that she spend over $1000 on a dress she would no longer need. With the phone and this threat on top of another threat that i don’t remember in detail she does follow him outside where he is screaming at her literally loud enough for us to hear him while sitting inside and advancing he keeps  on her while she backs away before he shoves her phone roughly Into her stomach when she asks for it back and raises a middle finger at me and my friend while mouthing “fuck you” at me and my friend who are doing nothing but innocently eating our McDonalds and watching the anger unfold. He was loud enough and aggressive enough that one of the McDonald’s workers actually approached us while they were still fighting to ask if the girl was okay. This is when he demanded that she leave immediately and meet him at her house and block me and my friend on Snapchat since we were at McDonald’s with her. I was also texting her before she met him trying to convince her to at least ask her mom to keep an eye out Incase he gets physical again but she was to scared to even tell her mom because of how vigorously infuriated this guy was with her just for going to McDonald’s with friends and despite me trying to rationalize with her she decided to just take his torment and take a warm bath afterwards to help ignore any pain. 

I really don’t know what to do at this point because I am doing everything in my ability by talking to her and keeping her grounded In sanity but it’s not easy considering she is not allowed to talk to me or any of her other friends. She is in fearful isolation where  her whole
Life just revolves around being the sponge for this guys anger and self esteem issues. I want to intervene because I know that at this rate with everything he is doing and with the actions that he manages to justify the blame onto her there is no possibility of him
Changing soon and I don’t know how much longer I can watch my friend get abused and tortured every day physically and emotionally causing her to lose all hope in any alternative that’s not suicide. I know I am not supposed to get involved but at the same time her boyfriend is intentionally getting me Involved along with just about everybody else in his girlfriends life. I just don’t know what to do considering how bad it is and considering I am the only one who knows this information but I also know that the last thing to do is Intervene and make a decision for her especially one that would make her uncomfortable or put her In danger. I think for now I will continue to try and talk her out of the emotional rut he is digging for her and suggest the widely available domestic abuse help if things get any worse but like I said she is terrified and hopeless beyond help so I’m not sure how optimistic I am in this.",getoffmybackhomie,2019-04-29 23:51:03,3,4141,31.62,91.33,2.13,1,49.89,17.39,94.54,62.4,21.71,15.58,1.91,0.48,0.41,12.48,0.29,6.13,4.52,15.14,7.78,6.45,9.15,2.22,16.01,4.11,2.1,2.56,0.82,2.75,7.78,1.57,6.09,1.21,3.14,0.72,21.28,0.31,1.47,7.08,6.11,12.99,2.17,2.66,1.09,2.58,2.29,3.79,1.93,0.48,1.06,0.36,1.81,0.48,0.7,0.48,0.22,8.07,3.04,1.18,2.54,1.26,1.11,3.94,9.49,0.8,14.51,1.84,7.41,5.34,0.46,0.43,0.34,0.12,0.02,0.1,1.04,0.63,0.17,0.14,0.1,0,6.16,1.98,1.64,0.02,0,0,0,0.02,0.58,1.84,0,0.07
bj3bdz,Should I Cancel the restraining Order Hearing the Week,"My husband lost his mind and abused me in front of our daughter.  He was charged with several crimes, was released on a very high bond and then put in jail again for something else but now he is out.  Part of his bond is no contact with me.  Right after the incident, I filed for a restraining order but since he was in jail, they postponed the hearing.  I have two advocates from a local domestic violence shelter going to support me in this hearing this week and I am pretty confident I can get the order but I am nervous and uncomfortable going up.  I also feel like his criminal case will take a while so the temporary restraining order might be enough.  Also, I am curious about him and I want to talk to him (I WILL NOT).  I know he is toxic but I was in a relationship with him for 13 years.

bj5pad,My ex abuser texted me last night and I haven’t stopped panicking since,"For context: I ended an abusive relationship two weeks ago. I did not/have not reported him. It was a civil breakup, he was wicked nice to me which made it that much harder. 

But the night before I left, after he gave me the ultimatum, either I move in with him and end my open relationship or we break up, his abuse was at an all time high. But as soon as he knew I was breaking up with him, he turned into a sweetheart. 

He texted me last night, asking me how my weekend was. I immediately called my friend Cody and he talked me down from a panic attack. I just don’t feel safe right now, especially with him knowing where I live. I can’t decide if I should play nice and respond or ignore him, knowing that might make him angry. Advice? I could just use a virtual hug right now too. Thanks for reading.

bja5w3,Advice,"I went to the police, they arrested him and reviewed the evidence (a recording of a conversation) and reviewed my statement. They told me the court decided there wasn't enough evidence to convict, but the police weren't comfortable letting him go and advised me to get a restraining order as legally they have to let him go. They said it was clear on the recording that something had happened that day and that it wasn't an isolated event, that it was a regular thing.
But he went free of charge.
His family don't believe me, they want to take the house from me.
They want me to contact him directly even though I've explained that I've been advised against it.

I have other voice recordings clearly showing a struggle and intimidating behaviour. I don't know if I should ask the court to go over these recordings or ask them to ask our neighbours as I'm sure they would have heard our arguments.

I want there to be some sort  consequences to what he's done to me. Even if it was just a caution, it proves to him that what he is doing is wrong, that he can't get away with it.

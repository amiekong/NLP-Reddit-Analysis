ag2cy6,Anyone else here annoyed about how the news reports traumatic stuff?,"The lead story tonight on NBC News with Lester Holt was a horrific and grizzly kidnapping and murder. 

The banner news story, some utterly wretched shit. 

No warnings. No preparation. They threw that out there like it was their gold for the day.

How utterly callous is that to people want updates on the news? 

I worked in criminal law in law school and saw crap like that. The attorneys who worked regularly on serial killer stuff, murder stuff, the way they coped with it was extreme exercise and professional comraderie. 

And still, they were friggin' heavy people, man. Why not? It's awful shit. 

Yet, our news in the US just tosses this stuff into the laps of every man, woman, and child here who just wants some news for the day and leaves them there with it. 

I think that is utterly callous. Considering I have trauma issues from being a crime victim as a kid, it's like yeah, just what I needed when I wanted some news, man.

Personally, I think they're a bunch of bastards for doing that to people.

ag2g7d,Teenage PTSD nightmares,"This post is not made for attention or to rant about my life. I’m posting this to revive advice, other people’s stories, or possibly help others. Anyways, with my PTSD I have specific nightmares that I can always remember and are usually reoccurring (a side affect of my anti-depressant is remembering my dreams more often rip). So, here are some of my nightmares I’ve had.

1. It was a sunny day and I was on the rooftop of a Japanese high school wearing the uniform and everything, and the girl who caused me to get PTSD pushes me off the roof and I watch myself fall to my death

2. I’m hiding in the bushes of some type of jungle school while that girl is trying to hunt me down and kill me

3. She drives a semi-truck right over me and kills me in front of my house

4. On purge night she doesn’t bother to torture my family, she just scares me until I commit suicide

5. She messages me anonymously on kik, and had cameras placed all around my house and watches me sleep. She says she’s coming over to kill me so I call 911, tell my family, and cry into my cat and dog

6. She attempts to rape me

I tried to tell the less violent ones, but for all of these I’ve woken up screaming and can never forget.

ag3gvt,I got a PTSD service dog and my brother has gone straight up psychotic (not exaggerating) over it. Advice needed.,"After a year of research and heavy thoughts, I decided to rear my own SD. My childhood-onset PTSD has been extremely severe (up from severe) for the last 18ish months thanks to an abusive relationship (mental, emotional, financial, sexual) and other things. I have not been able to make it to a supermarket by myself in over a year, never mind getting a job (ya Allah, how I desperately want one.)  
  
My research and discussions with my psychiatrist, general practitioner, other hospital psych folk and trauma therapist all pointed in the direction of a service dog. A few weeks ago, I practically tripped over a Godsend-- a double registered female American Pittbull Terrier from a local, family-run kennel. I was their first client who wasn't a direct referral so I had long talks with both the kennel owner and the breeder (fuck dog fighting, seriously.) To sum up a boring story, Pack's Nasira bint Chula (those silly UKC/ADBA names) is currently snoring two feet away from me and in barely a week she has turned my life around. 
 
When my brother found out I was getting a SD, he demanded to know the name of the kennel. He called me and screamed at me about how this was going to cost him thousands of dollars (he has nothing to do with my finances.) I wouldn't tell him, because he has a history of being unstable. Instead, he did some Internet stalking and called the kennel owner, telling him that I am ""unfit"" to have a dog and am ""mentally unstable."" 
 
Understandably, the kennel owner called the breeder and relayed the conversation. He also relayed that my brother was ""a complete asshole"" during the call. The breeder told the owner how I trained Nasira out of biting at our first meeting at 4 weeks, that I was the only client to visit their dog (twice,) and he was 100% confident in selling me Nasira. 
 
Two days after I picked up Nasira, I got a hysterical call from the kennel owner. My brother called him again, cursing him out and calling him every disgusting name in the book. The owner had answered via speaker because he was in the middle of dinner with his family, so his wife and kids were terrified that a stranger was threatening him. My brother even told him that I killed two of my cats (never happened.) I apologized all over the place for my brother's behavior and promised the owner daily pictures and videos so he could see that Nasira had everything she needed and was being trained properly.  
  
After a few days, the owner said that I was the most dedicated owner he'd ever seen and that Nasira was clearly thriving. I still post photos and videos of her progress.  
  
I don't know what the hell to do about my brother. I knew before this all happened that he was losing it; his heavy alcoholism was just the tip of the iceberg. I didn't realize how bad he'd gotten until that 2nd phone call.  
  
No further contact between the owner and my brother. I have not had any contact with my brother since a text I sent him the night of the phone call that said ""enjoy jail"" (he crossed our state's definition of harassment.) Mercifully the kennel owner is not pursuing charges, but I am left with a-- mentally unstable, alcoholic brother with a massive chip on his shoulder because I sought a non-conventional form of treatment for my PTSD.  
  
I talked to my mom; she is as upset and lost as I am. To boot, she's battling an incurable form of cancer and my brother just continues to heap his drama tantrums on her.  
  
For reference, my brother lives scott-free with my mother. I live in my own small apartment and get a small stipend; living in one room of my apartment with a heater, currently eating granola bars from one friend and cookies from another so I can prove that I pay for Nasira myself and not with my stipend (I ran a fundraising campaign and have more in the works, including selling a good chunk of what I own.)
  
I don't know what to do. I want to protect my mother. I will cut off my brother if I have to, but I don't want that at all. It would take physical assault before I did that, and suddenly that seems like a real possibility.  I'm scared to even visit my mother now (for the record, she's mostly on board with Nasira but my brother continues to pour poison in her ear about I don't even know what at this point. Money, larks, who knows.)

ag56g7,CBD Helped Me!,"[This is in no way medical advice, just my experience with CBD. I do not recommend using it to replace medical advice] 

I used to be on Prozac but I started to depersonalize and dissociate on it to the point where I couldn't tell dream from reality and I began to imagine things that never happened. Very strange. I stopped taking it and have been unmedicated for 6+ months. My anxiety + depression has become crippling and I have been very sensitive to loud noises/yelling to a point where I'll begin to sob if I hear something like that.

I bought a 500mg bottle of CBD oil (about 17mg a dose) and some CBD gummies (50mg each, eating half at a time). 

I know CBD doesn't work well for everyone, but for me it has been an absolute miracle so far. All the aches in my body disappear, the loudness in my head becomes silent. I cried the other night because I was able to listen to music without my head buzzing. 

Regular weed works also, but I don't like feeling out of control of my body. This was a good alternative for me 😊

I don't go in it very often during the day. It is a mess, and it is always a mess. When I go in it during the day, it is with the intention to clean it. I do a little bit at a time, but I never do it completely.

I think I hate it because of the breakdowns and also because it is a closed space where I'm stuck with my thoughts. Nighttime is hard for me in general because that is when the abuse took place. I've always had trouble at night. The room doesn't help. It doesn't feel like ""my"" room.

I went to therapy last week, got to talking about feelings and stress (surprise, ALL stress is traumatic stress for me! Yay! /sarcasm), and about an argument i had with my SO recently. We rehashed the end result, which was along the lines of ""it is ok to be wrong/you don't always have to be right"". Doc asked me how that knowledge felt, I said I wasn't sure. Then thought about it, and said ""relieved, I think? I don't know. I don't know what relief feels like.""

Doc has asked me to start keeping a record three times a day of what I feel, because as we were discussing he asked me what I felt and i didn't have an answer. I don't know what most of my feelings are. I know anger and a few different flavors of fear and sadness, and I know adrenaline and brief flashes of happiness. But that's not really my norm. My norm is usually some kind of sadness/depression (because depression sucks), with this overarching ""null"" feeling. Like there's something that should be there, but isn't. It's confusing.

ag95au,"I don't know how to live with myself.. TW: CSA, Rape","Hello all,

Lately I've been struggling with increased symptoms, flashbacks, and the like. I went through a very traumatic childhood with an emotionally, sexually, and occasionally physically abusive father. He was a bully, would take advantage of me, gaslight me if I protested; overall he was not a good human being. He ended up raping me at around age 5.

I can live with the fact I was raped. It hurts and breaks my heart that I had to go through something so horrific, but I can live with that. What I cannot learn to live with is the other traumas that occurred in my early childhood. Before age 5, I was forced by my father to sexually abuse my younger sister by 2 years. I had no choice, but afterward I was so broken and hurt by everything that was going on, I'm pretty sure I kept performing inappropriate sexual acts with her. My father taught me what I was doing was ""loving"" her. I honestly thought sex was how to show love.

Out of everything that was going on, I didn't know how to cope with it. An abusive father who would force me to orally pleasure him daily, yet that was the only positive attention I would receive from him. My little 3-5 year-old brain didn't know how to cope with it. So I'm fairly certain I sexually abused my sister as a result.

After being raped, I learned that everything that was happening between my father and me, and my sister and me, was wrong. Honestly I felt I deserved being raped because of what had happened between me and my sister. 

But now, as an adult, I feel the need to isolate myself from everyone who loves me. I feel so overwhelmingly ashamed of myself, it's a challenge to not just end it all. I can't feel comfortable around others because I'm so afraid I'm going to hurt them like I did my sister. I don't know how to live with myself.

I've tried to rationalize it, explaining that I was a child in an abhorrent situation, it wasn't my fault the way everything happened. But I can't accept that. I can't accept that I had the capacity to abuse my little sister. 

I'm just not sure what to do anymore. I don't know how to overcome this overwhelming shame. I've tried to look it up online, but I could find little on the subject. I've tried therapy and medication, but I find nothing helps.

I appreciate any help/advice you could give me. I'm just so desperate for help. I'm 26 years old, live alone because I can't feel okay around others. I feel so trapped in my PTSD and don't know what to do anymore.

Thanks for reading.",theshadowsweare,2019-01-15 06:41:17,1,478,14.48,7.16,96.91,10.08,13.66,15.48,94.56,61.3,25.31,17.36,15.48,0,0.21,1.46,0.21,7.95,3.77,12.97,11.3,5.02,7.32,3.56,21.13,2.72,1.46,2.72,1.26,0.63,10.04,4.39,5.65,1.46,2.3,1.46,8.58,2.3,0,1.67,2.09,17.15,5.02,2.72,1.46,1.46,2.72,4.39,2.3,0.42,0,1.88,5.02,0.42,2.09,2.09,0,7.53,2.72,1.26,2.93,0.84,0.42,7.32,11.72,0.63,10.25,1.46,3.77,5.23,1.05,0,0,0,0,0,0.21,0,0,0.21,0,0,18.83,7.32,5.23,0.21,0.21,0,0,0.42,0.42,4.81,0,0.21

ag9iga,I couldn't stay quiet after my male co-worker admitted his girlfriend is trying to frame him for assault. Now I may lose my job for stepping in.(Trigger domestic violence),"Background - I have C-PTSD from years of abuse starting from when I was 3 to 25. I am thankful for the few times people stepped in to protect me.

For the past few weeks, a co-worker has been emotionally, verbally, and physically assaulted by his girlfriend. I let him know if my background so he could come to me for advice or just to vent  I was hoping my bosses were doing something about it. He is currently sleeping in his car in below 20° F weather because she kicked him out of the house. She calls the work phone number if he doesn't answer his cell phone to scream at him.

A few days ago I noticed scratches on his face and neck. He admitted to me that she is trying to set him up for assault charges and is laying the foundation by telling everyone he abuses her. I know abusers. This guy is far from one and is more of a push-over.

I immediately went into action as I know male survivors are rarely listened to. She was on the work phone berating him as he sobbed listening to her. I took the phone from him and walked outside. I uttered the word ""bitch"" to shock her into silence. As soon as I said that she stopped and asked if I called her a bitch. I continued as I knew she would start up soon. I told her that she is abusing him, needs to stop calling work, and I would be going to the cops. My goal was to make sure she knew she wasn't working in the dark. Someone knew what she was doing.

She started screaming that she will have my job for calling her a bitch and hung up. Later on she did call my boss to complain about me.

After she hung up, I went to the cops to file a report. Now cops trigger my PTSD hard and I had to go to these cops before to drop off a wallet I found. The same one who dealt with me before took my report. He knew it was bad if I felt like I had to come to them. I told them what I saw on him and what he told me about her trying to get him in jail. The cop said I did the right thing.

My bosses want a statement from me on what happened. I fear she will succeed in getting me fired for saying the word bitch to get her to be silent so I could say my peace. From the few weeks of seeing him breaking down, I know she is tenacious. She wants me fired.",8Erinyes8,2019-01-15 07:18:03,6,483,56.58,68.29,19.97,1,14.64,12.42,93.79,60.46,24.43,20.91,10.35,0,0,10.14,0.41,3.52,4.97,17.39,8.28,2.69,4.97,0.62,20.7,4.35,2.69,1.24,1.04,1.04,5.59,1.04,4.55,0.21,2.28,0.41,17.81,0,0.62,5.18,5.59,9.11,3.11,1.24,2.69,2.48,0.41,1.24,4.35,0.62,3.11,0.62,0.83,0.62,0.21,0,0,8.28,0.41,2.28,3.73,1.45,1.04,8.9,8.07,1.66,14.08,2.9,6,5.38,3.73,0,0.41,0,0,0,0.83,0.83,0,0,0,0,10.97,6.83,1.45,0,0,0,0,1.04,0.41,0.62,0.41,0.21
aga3le,"Requested accommodation at work, my coworker keeps saying “yeah I can’t deal with it either” with the intent of minimizing my illness","So I work at a Jr high school. We have one incredibly emotionally unstable student. He will come in to the counseling office (where I work as the nurse) and just WAIL. It’s not normal crying, and he can turn it off and on like a switch. So several days during the week he will come in and “turn on” this wail. The kid “turns off” the wail as soon as his mom complies with what he wants. He is extremely manipulative. 

The wailing though. It brings me right back to the abuse. The wailing sounds exactly like myself and my siblings when we were suffering the abuse. Yesterday, he was in the office just screaming and wailing, and we had to have 6 police officers come in and try to manage it before he was taken to a hospital. 
It caused a panic attack. I had to sit on the floor of the bathroom just suffering through this panic attack and absolutely freaking out. I had told my coworker (who is completely aware of the abuse I suffered and that I am in treatment for it) and she replied “yeah I can’t take it either, but it’s just part of the job!”

This morning, after meeting with my therapist and having her write a letter for accommodation under the Americans with disabilities act allowing me to leave the area when he starts crying like that, I mentioned it to her and some of my coworkers as a heads up. 

My coworker immediately responded saying “oh yeah. I definitely can’t take it either, but I just choose to deal with it”

I’m frustrated. It’s not that I WANT to nope out. I don’t know how to get the point across that I receive flashbacks from this trigger. 

I guess this post is mostly a rant. That despite letting people in, they still refuse to acknowledge the gravity of what I’m going through. This has been the hardest time of my entire life.

agbwxp,How to release traumas when you feel watched?,"I always feel watched; in fact, I **WAS** watched, it's a part of my traumatic experiences, but I can't shake off the feeling. I'm not paranoid, this feeling isn't really scaring me, but it's limiting me from doing normal everyday activities because I feel like my abusers are always watching me. I can't turn off my mind, it's full of my abuser's words, so whatever I do, there's their 'voice' in my head, judging me, and that's limiting me from doing things that I want. I don't know what to do, I feel really helpless. My therapist says that I'm not clinically paranoid, but this is a consequence of long term extreme abuse.  

Anyone else feels this way? What can help?  

I thought about dancing to release traumas, but I feel watched when I dance and I expect someone to come in the room I'm in. I used to write, but my abusers read every one of my writings and from then, I can't write at all even if it's not happening anymore. I used to paint, but they always abused me into telling them why did I paint the thing that I painted. They find every razor I take, I know that's not a good coping mechanism, but it's still a release... they stalk me on the internet. Whenver I got out of my house, they followed me (no guys, this is not paranoia, I 'just' have overcontrolling parents (if that's the word)), so now even though they let me go out of my house, I always expect them to appear out of nowhere (as they did maaaany times).  

I really don't feel free even inside of my own mind, because I've been so abused that they were yelling at me - You think this, you think that. They behaved as they know what is going on in my head, which is why I, for a long time, had to tell them every thought of mine just to not be abused (not literally every thought, but I did that when they get suspicious). So yup, I feel like they know my thoughts, but I feel like that for a reason.  

I really have no idea what to do. I'm constantly whining about this on the Internet and I don't even know why. I can't talk to my therapist because I also feel watched in their office, but they say I'm not paranoid because my abuse history is that specific that even if I got paranoid, it would be an understandable reaction to this behavior of my 'parents' (I hate calling them parents).  

I have no friends (they stalk everyone new I meet, everyone I follow on Instagram etc, **especially** those of the opposite gender of mine). I have no hobbies (for obvious reason; they destroyed my every opportunity to have one). I have no life basically. I don't know what to do. I don't want to study, I don't want to live in this environment. When I get angry, they threaten me with hospital... (hospital was my escape for a long time, but meds physically destroyed me and they are required when you're in hospital, and besides that, I was also abused in hospitals... so no thanks, really).  

I feel helpless and I feel like my life is basically pointless. I see no point in going to therapist. I see no point in living and trying to find life inside of myself because every time I do something new, they have to ask questions and be suspicious and stalk, stalk, stalk. They blame me, of course.

agdi9y,"I don't know if I was assaulted... [TW: CSA, COCSA, Rape]","This might get a bit graphic.

I'm already planning on seeing a therapist about this, but for right now I just... need someone else's opinion on whether it's likely anything happened to me. I feel alone in my own mind and like I'm going insane trying to find the reasoning behind all this.

From ages 15-17 I was a victim of a lot of sexual abuse from predators online, but my amount of sexual trauma doesn't really... make sense, I guess. I have so much *physical* trauma and triggers that don't really make sense, some of which I don't even understand how they could be triggers. The only real triggers I got from those years of abuse were manipulation for nudes, stalking, a few specific words, cum inflation, a few ships and shows, and some other mundane things. (Somehow, mention of pedophilia isn't a trigger despite two of the predators being pedophiles).

But I have so many triggers and intrusive thoughts besides those, and I don't remember what they're from. To list a few:  
\- Even vague mentions or implications of rape/sexual abuse/any kind of creepy sexual activity causes me to dissociate, panic, cry, and shut down for pretty much the rest of the day. Some days are worse than others, and it's the absolute worst if I don't expect it. Usually, if I'm okay with seeing it, it's because I've already been triggered by it that day, or it's just a bad day thinking about trauma in general.  
\- Thinking about certain places, people, or scenarios from my childhood can cause me to dissociate and start to get upset about what I don't know.  
\- Looking at any kind of thick white liquid disgusts me, and fills me with intrusive thoughts of it for hours, especially awful thoughts of touching it or having it in my mouth. I can't even eat whipped cream anymore; at one point, some of it fell out of my mouth, and I had a full-on panic attack.  
\- Human penises repulse me, *especially* human cum. I know I'm a lesbian, so this might seem like an obvious thing to some, but I've always considered myself trans-inclusive, and if a dick is non-human I'm absolutely fine with it because trans girls are cute and valid as hell, and I am absolutely attracted to them as much as any other woman. Thinking back, I think I used to be bi, even from a young age, but after everything that's happened, I call myself a lesbian because I could never in my life date a man again. Back to the topic of this bullet point, I still have intrusive thoughts about images of human cum that I saw *years* ago. I can't get the images out of my mind, and they make me gag. Any kind of while cum absolutely horrifies me (I say white because I do enjoy some porn, but only if the dick in question is a colored tentacle with colored cum. So basically, no real life porn).

Along with these triggers, I have very, *very* vague memories of my 6th grade classroom, being on a desk. Nothing beyond that. And also some vaguely disturbing memories of some of my male childhood friends.

Apparently, about midway through 6th grade, I suddenly started showing these symptoms (many of which still continue today):  
\- Extreme body dysmorphia and dysphoria, and attempting to hide my body as much as possible  
\- Frequent dissociation  
\- OCD-like symptoms, mostly regarding contamination  
\- Steep drop in grades, to the point where I was barely passing classes (whereas I had been top of my class in the years before)  
\- Sudden extreme depression and anxiety  
\- Anorexia

The same thing happened on a much smaller scale in 3rd grade, which was the last year I was with another abuser (I'll call him Ryan). Ryan abused me heavily for 3 years, getting the worst around 3rd grade. He slept over at my house once, in the same bed as me. I don't remember anything happening that night, but I get a pit in my stomach when I think about it.

Throughout my childhood (up until my depression started) I was always really comfortable being naked around friends, regardless of gender. My friend Ruby and I would play ""Vagina, butt, butt"" where we would thrust out crotches into each other. I tried this with my friend Samantha, but she seemed really uncomfortable with it, so we didn't. Ruby had a brother, Tyler, who I had a bit of a crush on before realizing I was a lesbian. It always felt kind of forced, like I only liked him because he was a boy I saw a lot. I'd probably have a panic attack if I ever saw him again, but I don't know why.

As a young adult, I have some other symptoms that I've seen people relate to CSA, but I'm not sure about:  
\- Trouble orgasming to the point where it's sometimes impossible, *much* moreso when with a partner  
\- Crushing shame after masturbation, to the point of being suicidal or in danger of self-harm (which I did for a while in early 2018)  
\- Nearly all of the symptoms from 6th grade, continuing on to the rest of my life

Normally I would say that most of this is indicative of having been assaulted, but I really, genuinely can't remember anything happening to me physically. Yes, there are the vague memories, and I can't remember quite a bit of my childhood (and have instances of having completely forgotten traumatic events that I still can't remember, and only know about because someone told me what happened), but what if I'm making it up?

Again, I am going to go to therapy for this most likely, but I want to hear some thoughts from here. Do you think something may have happened to me? Or is this a result of mental illness caused by other abuse?

I can provide additional details for most things if you ask. I just want some help figuring out if my brain is lying to me, and if I can trust my feelings.",dykening,2019-01-15 13:24:21,1,1029,42.45,12.18,87.13,1.98,22.87,18.08,92.61,56.75,17.78,11.27,10.01,0.19,0.19,0.58,0.29,6.51,5.05,14.38,8.45,7.09,7.77,1.94,15.45,5.15,2.53,1.65,0.68,3.79,5.15,1.17,3.98,0.78,1.36,0.39,5.44,0.1,0.58,0.58,0.87,19.92,3.89,2.72,2.24,7,1.94,5.05,2.53,1.55,0.29,0.49,4.86,1.55,1.36,2.43,0.29,4.28,0.87,0.39,1.85,0.58,0.78,4.66,9.04,0.78,11.66,0.58,5.15,6.12,0.97,0.1,0.19,0,0.1,0.1,1.07,0.49,0.1,0.49,0,0,22.06,4.57,7.19,0.29,0.1,0.29,0,1.85,0.19,3.5,1.46,2.62

I've been listening quietly to people and their posts for some time now. It seems like a place that is relatively safe to talk about internal turmoil. My husband was brutally murdered in front of me and took his last breath in my arms about 16 months ago. He was beaten to death with a baseball bat by a couple of teenage boys over a neighborhood noise complaint. I have been going through the motions of life, having to deal with court dates and victim's advocates, my 12 year old son's emotions and reactions, my own depression and anxiety. I have reached out to counselors/therapists and tried to stay committed to going to sessions, but every time I attend a session I come out of it feeling worse than I did. Dredging up the past trauma does not seem to help, but hinders me. I have become agoraphobic and shelter myself in my apartment. Just going to the grocery store, picking up my son from school, doctor appointments, etc. are a hard commitment for me to keep. The anxiety of public places and feeling vulnerable around others is so overwhelming to me that even talking about it right now gives me adrenaline rushes.

agduii,How do I stop avoiding intimacy and become emotionally available?,"How do I stop avoiding intimacy and become emotionally available?

I have complex ptsd, bpd traits and disorganized insecure attachment. Let’s just say I don’t let many people in my intimate circle as rejection/abandonment is my biggest trigger to emotional dysregulation. So usually I’m the one abandoning others when things get rough or I sense they are pulling away. I have the tendency to pull and push people away. It’s confusing for them and me.

So yeah, I’m struggling.. because I had some opportunities to make new friends in this intensive outpatient program I was a part of.. several people tried to be my friend but I pushed them away because it was emotionally “safer” and more comfortable even though Im in pain due the lack of intimacy and love/support in my life. The only person I’ve ever cuddled with is my dad when i was younger (emotional incest and covert sexual abuse happened).

I do have empathy but notice I Struggle knowing how to comfort others because that never happened in my family. And like I get overwhelmed sometimes when I am already emotional so it feels easier to avoid and run away. Which is not how to have friends and is hurtful to others.

So yeah it’s tough. I crave romance and relationships but I’m also terrified and I wonder how someone can love me just for me.. on my bad days and when I am not benefiting them in some way. Conditional love is so foreign to me.

Any support, tips, or others relate? Thanks.

agf9lc,Seeking support from members who can identify with my type of cPTSD. Potential triggers inside.,"Hi,

This is the first time I've ever posted on an online forum about my diagnosis of cPTSD. I was diagnosed roughly ten years ago with major depression then subsequently PTSD and then eventually cPTSD. The initial trauma occurred in my early twenties. 

&amp;#x200B;

The trauma: I married the grand daughter of a powerful political family (very) whilst living in the ME. I did so naively and after knowing her for six months as a 21 year old. Her father was extremely conservative, traditional and powerful. It was at the beginning of the War (not a good time to be in the ME for a British or American national) and she had ran away from her country of origin to where we met. At no point did she warn me of the severity of reaction we may experience. The first death threat came in pretty much immediately after we informed her father of our marriage. Then more. And more. Then the threat actualised and we were lucky to escape (this period of threats and actualisation lasted for 8 weeks). We got to England but her visa only lasted for 6 months (visitor). In an impossible decision I had to decide either to return to the ME with her or remain in safety alone in the UK. If I did the latter I would send her there alone, divorced and in real danger. I decided to go back with her. I lasted 5 years. I worked obsessively and became extremely aggressive. We faced constant racist abuse (she was typically called a prostitute to my face anywhere from 1-5 times a day). Because of my symptoms and wishing to protect my wife I never backed down and was in constant fights with groups of people or individuals in all locations we lived in within the ME. We were sent various threats over the five years seemingly just when we finally gained some stability / safety. The five years ended with her cheating on me after another major traumatic instance (year 4).

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't understand I was traumatised and that I compounded that trauma by living back in the Middle East for a further 5 years after the initial traumatisation period. The trauma basically became compounded because we were attacked so regularly on the street and in my heightened state of hyper-vigilance I reinforced my 'survival strategies' as I felt it plausible any aggression could be another attempt on both of our lives. Moreover, having to protect my former wife as well as myself made the trauma more complex.

&amp;#x200B;

Im hoping to connect with people who suffer from PTSD / cPTSD after prolonged periods of being hunted by capable and powerful actors in foreign countries (or domestic) and have had actual attempts on their lives accompany numerous death threats.

agh3o5,I'm tired. I just need a safe place to be sad and scared for a minute.,"This isn't exactly a rant. It's just a hard day. I feel worn down. 

My partner and I have been together for 2.5 years and known each other for over 15. I moved here to be with him and there are great days when we just enjoy being together and have great talks. But 90% of the time I feel like all we're doing is trying to avert disaster and manage crisis. While I know that we have grown and made strides over the last 2 years, it's still incredibly hard. He has only recently, and begrudgingly, come to terms with a PTSD diagnosis. This knowledge has been helpful, but hasn't changed anything. We have an appointment for therapy on Friday. He has been doing Ketamine treatments. I want to believe that things can get better, but mostly I see things get better for a bit and then come back to some variation of hopelessness and rage on his part. 

I am tired of false starts.   
I am tired of feeling invisible. 

I am tired of solutions that don't work.   
I am tired of walking around on eggshells.   
I am tired of doing things that don't matter or seem to have an impact.   
I'm tired of doing everything from paying bills to grocery shopping to driving him to appointments to working 4 jobs to pay for treatments to buying gifts for Christmas our family. 

I am tired of feeling like I'm not in a relationship but like a nurse and a maid.   
I am tired of feeling like my feelings don't matter and not having any space for me in this relationship.   
I am tired of seeing glimmers of hope only to have them snatched from me by this goddamn disease. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this isn't his fault. I know that he is sick and I am truly approaching it from that perspective. I don't want to leave because I wouldn't just abandon him if he was diagnosed with cancer or diabetes or what have you. Even if I wanted to leave, I couldn't, because we have a lease together and I make most of the money and I would never just have him live in his car or break a lease and ruin both of our credit histories. I am just very tired and very lonely and very stressed out. He's my favorite person on earth and I'm happy to make accommodations, I just feel like it will be like forever and I feel like maybe that's my fault. I also feel like maybe it's impossible for it to truly stay the same and even some progress, slow progress, is good enough. I'm also scared that it might get worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am doing things for myself, like yoga and reading and therapy and medication management and writing and coming here. I am trying to take care of myself and not feel like I have to get caught up in every drama or fix every trigger. I am trying to do the best I can. I just feel like it will never be enough and I'm exhausted and sad. Sometimes I feel like I'm not sure what either of us are fighting for - normal? Good?   


Thank you for listening. It's been a hard week with a lot of triggers and it's going to get harder still and I am just trying to get my head in a good space.

aghdzu,Confused and overwhelmed,"I was diagnosed with PTSD but didn't take it seriously. My unit told me I was going to Afghanistan for like 27 days then flown back to clear and ETS. I had a meltdown and ended up being told I'm not going due to my diagnosis and stuff. I didn't think I had PTSD, because I never saw actual combat. That being said, I killed over 50 ISIS fighters on deployment from remote engagements (I fly UAVs) and 50 was when I stopped counting. I do not think that my numbers are 100% accurate because some of them are relying on Intel screeners who are notoriously bad at this stuff. Anyway, it never really bothered me much but lately it has been. My wife, her family, and I were watching Saving Private Ryan to test out her dad's new sound system and something about the opening D-Day scene made me physically upset. I started to tear up and my body felt like I was in fight or flight mode, particularly when I saw people get blown up from artillery/bombs. I even at one point had a ""flash"" of an ISIS fighter being killed via hellfire as if I was on the ground seeing it vs in the air. Just for like a split second. I got up and went upstairs and sat until I calmed down, and talked to my dad over the phone and then my wife. It was fine but something about it really upset me. It makes no sense to me because again, I was never in combat. I would walk out of my shelter in Kuwait and go get Charley's or something. I lived in a fucking barracks. Part of me wished I was there, for some reason, or maybe took the place of someone being killed even though it's 1. WWII and 2. A movie. I've been kind of haunted by that for a few days now and I have a therapy appointment tomorrow but none of this makes sense to me.

The most memorable deal of my life was being thrown out of a moving car. I was on the outside, he grabbed the drugs and I (stupidly) grabbed onto the car and tried to get it back. The driver hit around 30 mph and the passenger shoved me out of the car. I have permanent mental and physical scars from this incident. I find it incredibly hard to trust anybody (I only trust around 3 people completely) and I hate being in public. I'm constantly paranoid and looking around myself while in public. I worry about people seeing me, and a lot of other silly reasons. After browsing this sub it made me realize that I have similar symptoms.

aghv5l,"I saw him on the bus yesterday, more shaken today than yesterday","I think it would be safe to call him an abuser at this point, I wont detail anything but I think its really true. He sexually abused me and emotionally manipulated me and I need to see that for what it is.

He was my boyfriend for two years, I broke up with him because I felt unsafe around him and I told him that. He decided the best way to handle that was to show up at my house and offer to talk it out in person, so I huddled in my room and cried while I texted him to go home.

That was over a year ago, I put up so many walls and mde so many excuses for him over that time because it has to be my fault and not his, but it is his fault, its all on him. I had myself so convinced I was doing better, I wasnt scared to be on campus anymore, I was considering dating again, my therapist said she thinks twice a month appointments are better for me now because I was doing so good.

But I saw him on the bus yesterday and I panicked the whole way home, had flashbacks on the rest of my ride and in the kitchen while I was trying to make lunch, but I told myself he isnt here, he cant hurt me, and convinced myself I was okay. Im not. Ive been so dissociated in the last 24 hrs, throwing myself wildly into whatever my current task is, except now where all I can do is lay in bed and have these flashbacks and wish I had the strength to do my homework due tomorrow.

agi2qn,Worst therapist I've experienced in my LIFE (TW: Rape),"Guys, I'm FUMING right now. I saw a new therapist for our first session today with the idea of doing some EMDR. I'd done some research and found someone in my city that looked like they had the experience and would be able to help.


Despite listing herself as a specialist and my contacting being specifically for the purposes of CPTSD, our first interaction was for her to compliment my parents on the choosing of my name. I told her that I was looking into changing it and she look flustered and back tracked.



We start talking about family and how I'd experience little support, if any, and each time I visited or spoke to them it's nothing but denials, invalidating everything I say or think or remember, and insults. When the topic was raised of how last year I had woken up to being raped by a female friend, she said that as I had taken MDMA earlier in the night, I'd made myself more vulnerable and had some responsibility to take. I WAS FUCKING ASLEEP. HOW THE FUCK IS MY TAKING ANYTHING GOING TO MAKE ME MORE VULNERABLE THAN BEING GODDAMN ASLEEP?!
She also corrects me to say that it wasn't really rape, but sexual assault. When I ask her to clarify, she says that because in this instance it was a woman doing this to a man that even though it's horrible, it's sexual assault because women can't rape men. 
She tries to explain why EMDR works and fucking makes something up using an explanation of left and right brain as creative and analytical working together.
She asks me to think of a time I felt safe, and when I tell her that I don't know what safety feels like because nobody has ever stood up for me and I've always had to protect and defend myself, she tells me thst im exaggerating and that there must have been some time I felt safe.
And to round off this shit hour, she ends the session by saying that all things happen for a reason.


What the actual flying monkey fuck happened to me today, guys? Why is this the kind of experience I have everytime I go to see a therapist?

agitcm,I should have turned left...,"It was a nice summer in South Georgia. I was working as a Police officer at the time. My shift was coming to end maybe had an hour left either way I was the primary officer in the area, which means I went back to the station after my partner in the area. My area was a highway and forested area. My wife at the time texted me and asked me to meet her at the archery range to talk while she shot a few arrows. Again I had time and it was my wife so of course I agreed to meet her. I do remember earlier that month she mentioned she wanted a divorce. This is my first marriage we both married young I was 21 she was 20. So I meet her at the range. I tell dispatch where I was and that I was available for any calls still. So we meet chit chat of course typical ""Hey honey how's your day..."" Then we start lightly arguing. We both decide it's not the best idea to do this publicly for many reasons We get in our respective vehicles and depart the range. She takes the lead and heads right towards home. I sit at the stop sign for what feels like eternity even to this day...  I watch my wife's car drive away I'm upset, mad whatever you want to call it. So I snap back to reality and call back to dispatch that I'm going to refuel and return to station which means turning right and leaving my area which I do following my wife a little faster than anyone should including a peace officer. Then it happens... A mile away from the range I get a call about a car wreck... Two vehicles... And a newborn. I have never flipped a U-turn so fast in my life but in hindsight and my dreams it couldn't be slower. Mind you I'm a mile away when I get the call. The speed limit is 55 mph and I was going maybe 65 mph so literally a minute away... Again feels like an eternity.. I arrive on scene and am still blown away, baffled, distraught.. there was a Red mustang coasting slowly away in the distance with the rear bumper barley attached.. and a flipped white kia Sorento... I'll never fucking forget this... As I got out of my car what felt like a crowd of 100 people (I honestly can't recall the actual number) all bum rush my squad car demanding I do my job! I was on my way out of my car when I see a group of five guys standing in front of that goddamn mustang to stop the maniac driver... I just stare in confusion as to why.. and then I see the mom in passenger seat of the Kia crying and holding her bloody leg ""WHERE'S MY BABY!! WHERE'S MY BABY??"".. complete disregard for her own well being.. that's when I notice the door was PEELED back like a fucking tuna can.. then I notice the Dad is peeling back the rear passenger doors to get to his newborn... Luckily the baby was well strapped into the car seat and car and was just scared... Remember the ""100 people"" and police who showed up? We just sat there more or less and watched this father protect his family while ""we"" mainly I just watched in shear panic and disbelief. I don't remember anything else or if I even did a fucking thing except wallow in my own terrible life moment while on Lookers blamed and booed me.. I do remember trying to talk to my then wife about it and she said I was trying to distract her from the divorce. But in all reality if I had just...turned left... I could have pulled over that mustang for literally anything and she wouldn't have clipped the white kia while trying to over take it causing the Kia to flip three times...Everyone survived with minimal injuries. I just feel like such a failure for not doing ANYTHING. I'll never forget those cars, the crowd, the screaming mother, crying baby, the blood, the shear strength of SOMEONE doing SOMETHING (the father)...",davethemanguydude,2019-01-15 23:34:16,8,715,55.47,48.88,90.73,11.34,15.21,13.85,88.11,55.94,17.9,13.01,9.23,1.12,0.56,2.1,0,4.9,8.11,12.31,7.27,5.73,7.27,1.26,16.36,3.64,2.38,2.1,1.4,1.54,3.78,1.26,2.38,0.56,1.12,0.42,11.19,2.66,0.56,2.8,0.84,8.95,2.38,0.7,1.26,2.66,0.98,1.96,2.52,1.54,0.28,0.56,1.4,0.7,0.42,0.42,0,7.83,3.5,1.4,1.96,1.12,0.56,5.87,7.97,1.4,18.74,3.64,9.09,7.27,1.12,0.42,0.56,0,0,0,1.26,0.7,0.14,0,0.28,0,18.04,12.03,1.26,0,0,0.42,0.42,0.14,1.12,2.1,0.56,0

agm4bh,Is CBT the way to go for me? Open to suggestions,"Hello. Call me Will for convenience.

Today I have an okay day, so I figured I could use this opportunity to think about my situation level-headed and see if anyone with PTSD can recognise themselves and reflect their experiences and opinions on how to move forward 

So anyway. I'm 26 years old and regularly go through periods of anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Even on good days like these, from the moment I'm not at work doing my thing, I often have moments wondering about the reason of it all and risking going down a dreadful cycle. Or it's little things like flinching when close friends touch me. Getting nervous in crowds. Losing friends and burning bridges because I can't bring myself to 'impose' myself on friends. Very erratic sleeping  and eating patterns. Trouble with concentration. My appartment is far from clean and I don't see many  guests here. The list can go on really. On bad days it can lapse into depressive mood swings that can last for weeks. It once led me to a cocaine addiction although I'm clean now.

This has been going on for longer than I care to remember and at some point I had started psycho-analysing my own life. Maybe there's more damage that I haven't processed than I originally thought? This isn't mandatory reading but if it helps make sense of my situation, barge in on my past here. Or scroll past.


At 6 years old I've gone through the chaotic divorce of my parents. My mom eloped with a drug dealer and my dad was left to take care of three kids, one job, little money. I was left in the dark about what happened, really, and for some time never knew if I was ever going to see her again or why she even left. I'm up to speed now, but as a kid not much. I spent a lot of years mostly staying at my grandparents and kind of distancing myself from my parents and older brother/sister.
Later on my dad got together with, and eventually married, your typical evil stepmother. Ok I get that our household needed drastic changes. But she was too aggressive, too impulsive, too angry about it. This became a toxic household up until I was 20 years old. During that time I witnessed my brother escaping into drugs, alcohol and aggressive behaviour at home until he left, my sister just disappearing. None of us dealt with this new situation we were supposed to. It was a toxic household filled with anger, yelling, throwing stuff, lots of crying for years. I've managed to reconcile with all of them over time although contact is sparse. I figure though damage was already done?

Not to mention as if my household wasn't bad enough, school was possibly worse. After elementary, going to a new boys-only school I soon learned it became hard for me to connect with people. I became the odd one out and after some time I became victim of regular bullying, both emotionally/mentally and physically. I didn't have the mental constitution to defend myself. I got ganged up on while being recorded, insulted, cornered, choked, you name it. It once got do bad I blacked out in a blind panic and singlehandedly choked one of the bullies until he fainted. When I came to, I freaked out and got beat up by the others since I could barely move after doing that. This went on for five years until I changed schools. None of my friends or family ever knew. This was going on during the same time the Stepmom came into the picture. I was afraid to go to school every single day. I was afraid to go home every single day.

After some years I thought I had moved past most of this and moved into my boyfriend's place. Ready to start my own story, with my own choices.
After 2 years I proposed and by year three we would've been married. Eventually I found out, a week before the wedding, through his doctor, that he was HIV-Positive and hadn't been taking his meds. Despite us having talked about HIV multiple times and us not using protection. After me confronting him I also learned he'd been amassing massive debt. A lot of it on my name as well. I broke up with him that same day but for financial reasons we had to stay in the same appt for some time. I had learned I'd acquires 15k in debt while having not a single dime on my name. I hit a depressive burnout where my hair started falling out from the stress. He continued to force himself on me sexually. I eventually became homeless after three months and had lapsed into drug abuse. I think this was a final chronic drop that I never really recovered from 

Cue now, three more years later. I have my own appartment. My debts are paid off and I have a savings account. I have a steady job/income and a good relationship with my mom, dad and Stepmom. I'm clean. I learned I didn't acquire HIV myself, although doctors can't really imagine how that's possible given my ex's viral count at the time.



Coming from a homeless, broken, hopeless, indebted mess... People would think I'd be doing better. Maybe I should be proud even? 
I'm lucky if more than a few days go by without me fantasizing about how my life will end. I have good days. But I don't feel happy and don't feel capable of getting to a point where I think I can get confident or stable enough to take the necessary steps. My life feels like an endless cycle of loss and disappointment. In myself, my people, the world. Stuck in survival mode without living.

Some time ago i lapsed into suicidal thoughts again and made an appointment with a therapist that specialises in depression, anxiety, PTSD, the works. It's next week. I've done other forms of therapy including medication to no avail.

I figured maybe asking here if PTSD is the right direction/treatment option to look for, and if people here could offer some insight considering I haven't confided in many people personally. Does this get better? Or do we just learn to accept our damages and cope with them? Is there a proper way to prepare for my appointment or for CBT if it comes to that?

Thanks in advance. Sorry for the autobiography.

He refuses any medication due to prior negative experiences with SSRIs. Recently his depression seems to be worsening and I dont know how to help. I'm dealing with my own anxiety and depression issues (Postpartum related; I'm also in therapy and undergoing CBT) and I'm really struggling to be supportive. He sometimes stays in bed all day and I feel torn between anger because I need help with our home and children and being compassionate because I know he is trying. For those of you out there who have struggled with PTSD and depression, what did you need most from your partner? Did you feel supported? Was there any specific practice that brought more harmony to your relationship (ex. Set routines, dedicated alone time, etc)?",zombiethoven,2019-01-16 11:24:43,26,177,37.46,84.55,16.91,1,14.75,27.12,90.4,49.72,14.69,11.86,5.08,0.56,2.82,3.39,0,2.82,2.26,12.43,9.04,5.08,9.6,1.69,17.51,6.21,3.39,2.26,0.56,4.52,10.17,3.39,6.78,2.26,0.56,2.82,14.69,0.56,1.13,0,3.95,13.56,3.39,2.26,1.13,5.08,1.13,1.13,2.82,0.56,0.56,1.13,3.39,1.13,2.26,0,0,8.47,5.08,1.13,3.39,0,0,4.52,12.99,0,10.17,1.69,3.39,5.65,0.56,0,1.13,0,0,0,0.56,0,0,0,0,0,13.56,4.52,1.69,0,0.56,1.69,0,0,0,1.69,3.39,0

I am on 100mg of Zoloft and my psych is aware of my nightmares, but we were hoping increasing the dose would avoid them. I adore my Zoloft, so I’m not willing to give it up, but I can’t handle these nightmares. I dream people stab me, beat me, drown me. That my mother steals my babies (I don’t even have or want kids), that she kills me, publicly humiliates me, shoots me, even tied me a noose and told me to hang myself once.

agrfbs,Any advice on how I can overcome my fear of sounds during the night?,"When I was a toddler my mom divorced my violent and alcoholic father and we moved out. My mom gained full custody. When I was under the age of 5, he came a few times during the night and broke the window. We managed to escape to a neighbor. But one time he managed to get in. We didn’t hear him so we didn’t wake up until he was in the bedroom. Fortunately he didn’t become angry. But another time he managed break in during the day. My aunt and cousin was visiting. He kicked and beat my mom severely. My teenage cousin forced me out while I was fighting to stay there. I didn’t want to leave my mom in danger. But my cousin managed to drag me out and get us in safety at a neighbors and the neighbor called the police. Turns out my mom almost got killed that day. 
As an adult I have been to therapy and was diagnosed with PTSD. I am doing much better now, but still I get worried when hearing sounds during the night. As a child I promised myself that I would never sleep so deeply that I wouldn’t hear intruders coming in. It worked. And till this day I always get up and check where the noises come from. And I have troubles falling asleep until I know nobody are inside my home. Fortunately this doesn’t happen so often. Maybe once a month or so. But I realize that it is not healthy. I read some use white noises to sleep better, but that would make me even more worried as I would then not hear anything at all.a
Any advice on how to overcome my fears of someone breaking in? CBT and stoicism helps me normally.

agrmat,PTSD-related angry tone of voice is getting in the way of my relationships,"Had a fun time in therapy this week. (/s) It’s become extremely apparent that one of the symptoms of my PTSD is that when I get anxious about — well, many more things than I thought, this intense, angry tone of voice comes out.

Needless to say, it doesn’t work very well in my relationships. DH Is dealing with his own PTSD in therapy, one big symptom being avoidance. and has almost never called me on it when he notices it (way more often than I do.) But he hasn’t avoided telling me that we actually have a friend? friends? who have told him they only want to see him alone, without me.

*Totally embarrassing.*

So basically I left therapy the other day feeling like I should just say “f*** it” to any more socializing, it’s just too d*** hard to start learning how to undo literally decades of abuse and communicate more effectively at my age (61). It just feels overwhelming and like too much work and I’d be better off just being a loner, other than being around DH.",Anonymous0212,2019-01-16 15:56:46,10,194,27.36,39.82,67.42,1.48,17.64,17.53,91.75,57.73,18.56,10.31,6.7,0.52,0,2.58,0.52,8.25,3.09,14.43,9.79,11.86,4.64,2.06,19.07,8.76,5.15,2.06,1.55,3.61,7.22,2.06,5.15,2.58,1.55,1.55,10.31,0,1.03,0,2.58,14.43,4.12,1.03,1.55,1.55,2.06,4.64,4.12,0.52,2.06,1.55,2.58,0,2.58,0,0,7.73,3.09,1.55,1.03,1.55,1.03,2.06,12.89,0,12.37,0.52,6.7,5.15,1.55,0.52,0,0,0,0,1.03,0,0,0,1.03,0,21.65,4.64,4.12,0,0,1.03,0,0.52,1.03,2.58,3.09,4.64

My gf wants me to tell her about when I’m triggered, the causes and all that, but it always feels like I’m doing something really wrong or I’m a huge burden. My trauma junk is from neglect, mind games, physical abuse when I was a kid and it manifests in unusual ways. Today I was triggered and I know she didn’t mean it but I shut down at a restaurant breakfast and went robot mode. 

She kept telling me to take the car and go home and that she could walk back home (id say it was a couple miles away or slightly more) which made me feel worse so I struggled really hard to pull myself together and managed to explain to her later via text why I was triggered into that weird episode and it just sounded so stupid and she seemed put off by it. I know it isn’t easy.

The rest of the day I was shaky and weird and emotionally messy. I don’t know how to tell her what’s happening because I’m not sure myself if it was an anxiety attack or emotional flashback or what. Emotions are beyond me and she thinks that telling me I can just leave her places when I’m panicked will fix it.

My girlfriend has PTSD from multiple sexual encounters with an abusive ex along with other encounters that I’d rather not get into. I read online about EDMR and I was wondering if it’d be able to help her. We don’t have much money so seeing a therapist isn’t in our budget.

ah1mm3,Found out my abuser (my dad) has mild autism (SCD),"Found out my abuser (my dad) has mild autism (SCD)

Over the past year in Therapy, I found out I experienced covert sexual abuse (dad sexualizing me by staring at body, making inappropriate comments about body, flirting by sitting on his lap and cuddling up until I was a teenager) and emotional incest (dad used me as his emotional/intimate/affectionate support he was not getting from my mom). His love was also conditional because when I did not fulfill his needs he was rejecting and emotionally abusive calling me all kinds of names like monster, whore, narcissistic, etc.

So I just found out on Friday he has Social Communication Pragmatic Disorder which some people call mild autism or “autism lite.” Basically he has all the communication issues as someone with autism but he doesn’t have the restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. I’ve read a lot about autism and people on the spectrum (even high functioning) often have poor social and sexual boundaries and also tend to be more sexual deviant than people with out the disorder (I can link these articles if anyone is interested). People on the spectrum also tend to have lower empathy which may explain how my dad did not see/feel the negative impact of sexualizing his own daughter like Someone not on the spectrum would.

So I’ve spoken to some therapists and sexual violence advocates about it. A lot of them have said this can help you explain and understand why he did what he did but it is not an excuse for bad behavior. Another therapist said him not knowing what is socially appropriate plus him learning sexualized behavior from his own father explains some of his behavior but the fact that he was attracted to his daughter is another issue—sexual deviance. Another advocate said, “now that he has his diagnosis, watch his next step. If he really cares, he will do anything he can to work on his issues that affected you. Like holding himself accountable and being honest about his actions and be willing to dig dip within his self and history to get better. Parents owe it to their kids to say they really messed up, they love you and will do everything they can to fix it and not do it again. Plus your dad has his PHD so I know he is smart enough to figure out the family dynamics and improve it. His job is to prove to you he is a safe person to be around, not the other way around.”

I guess I am processing this new diagnosis of him. I think knowing he has this diagnosis makes me less angry with him and more empathetic because he didn’t really know what he was doing was wrong. After I had accused him of what he did, he was genuinely mad and confused because he didn’t think it was sexual abuse because he never touched me (rigid thinking—feature of autism). But he also accused me of lying and making it up and made himself to be the victim (shows immaturity and low empathy). One thing he did after I confronted him three years ago, is he stopped staring and looking at me. And once again made himself like the victim, “I can’t look at you without you thinking I’m staring sexually at you..” then he also said he has stopped staring at women in General for longer than 3 seconds. So I think in his mind, he might thing he has already fixed the problem. In the past he admitted he might of stared but it wasn’t sexual. And then earlier this year he said I may be making up those events when he stared because he doesn’t remember it.

One thing I will say is, I will still have limited contact with him and maintain restricted boundaries because my ptsd symptoms act up when I am around him.

Any advice and support?

ah2yaw,"Lost my job, PTSD got me a bit lost","For the first time I am starting to see that I have been living in a vicious circle for years. Every time I start enthusiastically and super driven to a new job, or a new project, or a new adventure, only to find out that I am passing by myself. My body hurts every day and the muscle tension worsens as I try to keep a job. What happens then is that I have to report sick at work, then sit at home for weeks because, among other things, my muscles can not get better quickly enough, then go back to work enthusiastically, and then get sick again.    


This happened to me again in recent months. I was offered a fantastic job and I started full of good sense. But then I became ill. I could no longer move my arms due to the muscle tension. I became uncertain about my own abilities. I was ashamed of myself to my employer and colleagues and hardly dared to go back to work. When I got better again, I had to report sick again after the second working day. And now I am at home without work. It is so hard to admit that I can not do this now. I have tried everytime. But it is impossible to keep up.   


I have been sexually abused on several occasions and I never realized the damaged it caused. I have incurred debts and I am unable to repay them. I can't sleep without having either sleep paralysis or nightmares forcing the terror to my conscious mind. My thoughts keep racing. My body hurts. I feel empty, depressed and it is difficult to enjoy the things I used to love so much.   


I can not afford to stop working, because I have to pay off, and because the fixed costs continue to exist. So how can I focus on my recovery if the worries about money keep following me? And how do I get to fully recover if I start working again? I am lost!  


So back to now. I don't have a job, and I lost interest in nearly everything I used to do. What do you guys do to keep up with day-to-day life? How do you manage to keep a clear head? I have so many questions but I don't really know how to put them into the right words so... anything helpful is welcome.

ah4e1u,"He let me out and we watched her burn together...(tw-violence, sexual abuse, child abuse)","One of my trauma dreams took a turn for the weird lately. In this dream, I’m in the house I lived in after 8 years old. This isn’t the one where most of my brothers abuse happened but it’s where I remember some of the instances. I have the reoccurring dream and it typically is my brother yelling at me and my mom while he watches us burn alive in the house while he watches from the outside. Over recent years, I found out my mother and father sent my brother and me over to this woman’s house and she would molest him in exchange for drugs he would bring back. I would hang out with her only son, unaware of why we came and went so often. The son would touch me inappropriately as well, he did what he probably learned so I’ve let go of that a long time ago.
Before I knew this info, the dream would only be incoherent shouting. He would clearly be cussing and screaming. But it was...lost in translation. He’d point at the driveway which I could only imagine was the time he had to escape in the neighbors bushes for mom not to hit him with the car. I was in the front seat. So there we would be in this dream, crying, suffocating, and dying together. After finding out that mom didn’t stop using with my brothers pregnancy..she told me three years ago while we were both extremely high on cannabis. I spent the rest of the day walking around the neighborhood and getting lost. After that, he would be clearer with his words. I found that he was mainly cussing at mom and thought he was saving me from a life “like his” by killing me too. Mind you, I’m 14 in this dream and this dream first occurred after I got raped by a classmate. I’m still 14 in this dream. He is the rail thin, track mark covered 18 year old I remember at the time, but then he changed dramatically in last nights dream..and so did the dream. This time, I helped him plan a time that mom would be home and so would dad (dad was relapsing at the time) so we could trap them. He looked physically well. He asked me if I trusted him. We devised a plan where they wouldn’t even know the house was burning along with fumes. I’d basically be in there and then run off to pretend I’m helping them find an escape..but the window was open and ready to be locked.

ah4hos,Car crash related ptsd,"I've only been in 2 real car accidents in my life. One when I was 9 and my mom was driving, and one last Saturday.

The accident when I was 9, I was in the passengers side back seat of a 2 door car. I was distracted by something we'd borrowed from a friend of my mom's and hadn't hooked my seatbelt yet. We were at a 2 way stop with no stop for the main road and there was a bush my mom couldn't see past. She thought it was clear and we were tboned by a big truck on the passengers side of the car. Both vehicles were totalled. I, because I hadn't hooked my seatbelt, slid from the passengers seat to the middle of the backseat. Paramedics and police who arrived on scene said had I been wearing my seatbelt I would have had a crushed leg that possibly would have had to have been amputated.

The accident last Saturday, I was at a similar intersection, a 2 way stop with no stop for the other road. There was a lot of traffic and a red light at the intersection down the road for the one that didn't have a stop. When a vehicle left a gap open for the street I was on, I looked and I couldn't see any cars but I couldn't 100% see. I went because I thought it was clear and I was wrong. I got tboned near the rear passengers wheel well. Both cars were ok and nobody was hurt, but when I realized what was about to happen I instantly couldn't function right. All the things I knew to do flew out the window. I tried to hit the brakes repeatedly before I realized that I was missing the pedal and was stepping in the same spot, like move your foot over, you're not in the right spot. The second I hit the brakes I threw the car into park and basically started having a severe panic attack. I was shaking and crying and couldn't respond to the woman who hit me when she came over to check on me. I eventually partially pulled it together and dealt with the situation, but all I could think of was what they said about how I could have lost my leg. It's gotten so stuck in my head.

The accident wasn't bad, the vehicles were fine, both me and the other driver weren't hurt. Not even a broken window or anything.

So I don't know why I can't make myself drive anywhere near that road anymore. It is literally like 2 blocks from my house which means I go the long way around now to get to the store, to work, to anywhere. My boyfriend drove that way and I started to have a panic attack. Every time he turns and I see a vehicle ""too close"" (realistically 100% far enough away) I start to panic.

I don't know if it's just a ""give it time"" thing or what I can do to get past this....

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",QueenFrankie420,2019-01-17 16:16:33,3,524,43.38,14.26,96.22,4.48,17.47,12.98,88.17,58.97,16.98,11.83,10.11,0.57,0.38,0.57,0.19,5.15,9.35,11.26,12.02,4.96,6.49,3.44,20.99,2.29,1.15,2.48,2.48,1.72,3.82,0.76,2.86,0.76,0.38,1.15,4.58,0.57,0.38,1.15,0.38,10.31,2.29,0.95,2.1,2.1,0.95,2.67,2.48,1.72,0.38,0.38,1.34,0.95,0.38,0,0,5.34,1.15,0.57,1.53,0.76,1.34,10.88,7.25,0.19,19.27,3.63,10.31,5.53,0.38,0,0.76,0.38,0,0,0.38,0,0,0.19,0.19,0,14.12,6.11,2.86,0,0,0,0,0,0.76,3.63,0.38,0.38

ah5e47,NSFW Missing Gap in My Memory,"So, I have this gap in my memory from when I was around 7-8 years old. My parents have filled in the more significant parts of the gap, but most of it is totally lost to time minus a trip I took that I only remember because I threw up on a stuffed tiger that I kept by me at all times and it got a bit discolored from it and I had to leave over it (totally... Sanitary?)

Most of this filling in had to do with a number of disturbing things. From me seeing people in the shadows (not monsters like, living breathing people that radiated malicious intent), I wouldn't sleep, I constantly cried, I started peeing my pants, and a couple more things I think were genuine hallucinations. I even slept walked into my parent's bedroom and asked my mom if killing her would break her love for me (my parents aren't liars by the way, and they never told this story with a light heart).

However, I remember one thing. A church, and I remember one person there: P.

P was my brother's best friend at the time. He had a history of coming on to random people but never anything too serious. He would always come around with my brother, my parents filled in a couple gaps including one where I spoiled a movie for him on accident.

P was in this church, and I was in the kitchen. I walked around the table, I saw him, and then my memory cut to a bouncy castle outside, but I can't remember anyone else. He was wearing a red shirt and khaki shorts, it was summer, and I had gone in with a crocodile ZooPals plate to get some grapes while everyone else was still outside.

About the time my memory stopped being a worthless POS, he stopped coming around. I later figured out that he tried to come onto my brother, and when my brother declined he started attacking him.

I tried to force myself to remember something about the church, but when I tried to remember past walking up to him in the kitchen, the details got extremely weird, like it was a mixture between what actually happened and a placeholder, like when you write over a deleted image and the recovered image is messed up to an extreme degree. This cause a panic attack the likes of which I hadn't felt before, and I tried to kill myself over it (obviously failed, thank god).

I'm not saying I have PTSD, nor am I asking if I do, it just sounds a lot like PTSD and I didn't know where else to post this. Its been weighing extremely heavy on me and I just needed to get it out.",ellieisherenow,2019-01-17 17:54:00,1,472,56.55,19.85,94.72,3.51,22.48,15.47,91.74,59.75,19.92,13.77,10.81,0,0.21,2.54,0.21,6.14,6.99,15.68,6.36,6.14,6.78,2.12,17.37,3.18,2.33,1.69,1.06,2.12,4.03,0.85,3.18,0.42,1.06,1.06,7.84,1.91,0.21,0.64,2.97,12.29,3.18,0.85,1.27,2.12,2.12,3.6,2.33,1.27,0.42,0.42,2.54,1.27,0.42,0,0.64,8.26,2.75,1.69,2.75,1.27,0.64,10.38,4.45,0.64,16.95,2.33,8.69,5.51,0.64,0.21,0.64,0,0.85,0.42,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,0,14.19,4.45,5.72,0.21,0,0.21,0,0.21,0,1.69,1.69,0

ah7iil,Life is a rollercoaster,"I'm constantly going from med to med, counseling from one facility to another. My dreams are always nightmares and I find myself so easily disappointed.

I'm about to quit my job because of all the gossip in the clinic, this sucks because everyone I talk to just says that it's a really normal aspect in a clinic. 

I have too much integrity to just sit and hear the gossip so I've gone to management about it many times and have asked people not to talk to me.

Whenever I have a really bad ptsd attack is always after I find myself being disappointed in myself or the good of others. Like the pollution on the planet, people not being as nice to me as I am to them, friends flaking on me, the delusional ways in which people live.

I always tend to get so overwhelmed about these things and it results in full blown panic, paranoia and hallucinations.

As a child I was sexually abused by family members I had trusted and for a very long time I just thought that I had been doing something wrong. Like I wasn't behaving well enough and it was some form of punishment. Before this is was always so lighthearted and playful and wanted to make friends.

When this started happening I became isolated and I started to hate everyone. I was only 5.

I still suffer from triggers from that moment.

When I was 20 I began a mentally and emotionally abusive relationship. It started ok and just went down hill. He always accused me of being overly friendly and he killed my dog out of negligence.

I always tried to do the best I could but constantly always told myself there must be something wrong with me.

I am now at a point where I am trying to seek help and not be in an environment that is detrimental to my health like my current workplace.

I just don't feel a lot of hope right now.

ah99wp,Fuck this muscle tension and the flashbacks,"Heard a flag flapping in the wind and the snapping sound reminded me of gunfire and my muscles locked up - tension so taught the lactic acid made my body catch fire. My own personal highlights montage was already playing on the back of my eyes. It's weird the way the memories come back the night my sister was raped she texted for help but in the memories I hear her screaming in the dark and I can't find her. On the way home every car on the highway was about to crash into me. The urge to jump out of the moving vehicle and run into the forest beside the road was overwhelming.

I went for coffee with an ex girlfriend and knocked my coffee over because I just dont have the motor control anymore. She asked me if I knew my eye was twitching, I didn't. Yesterday (Today?) I don't know for sure but they started me on an SSRI and I had a freakout while home alone, and I couldn't find my anti-psychotics. Last time this happened I tried to hang myself - this time I put my fist through my bedroom door and then ripped it off it's hinges.

My muscles burn right now but I can't have muscle relaxants because they're ""AdDiCtiVe"" which I know deep down is true - but fuck me sideways my body is on fire and I'm ready to kill myself. I question taking a cocktail of random pills when valium 2mg not even the full strength one always did the job. My favorite part is that SSRI's have ""discontinuation syndrome"" which may include flu like symptoms and worsening of symptoms. While evil valium has ""withdrawal"" flu like symptoms but is totally not the same. Whatever doc just get me hooked on whatever will make this stop.

The best description I ever heard for ptsd was like having a glass and everytime something bad happens a little water is added - and when it's full well then you're fucked. 

Monty python is on tv and it just made me laugh: it is the scene in the Holy Grail where John Cleese storms a castle alone and stabs everyone men, women and children on his way up with glee he stops at one point turns around and slashes some roses on the wall - fucked up but I grinned. At this point my forearms are burning while typing from too much remembering so I'll leave it here.

ahbcym,Hypnosis therapy was effective,"Has anyone here tried hypnosis to assist with recovering from trauma? I did when I was 18 (currently 21) and barely remember even going to the sessions but have improved tremendously because of the sessions. I was repeatedly sexually abused as a child by a family member. My boyfriend at the times aunt ran a hypnosis therapy clinic in Chicago. She offered a few free sessions with a great hypnotist there which was extremely kind of her because there was no way I could afford that at the time. I wanted to forget every memory of being molested and abused and pretty much trick myself into having no memory of it so I did not have to actually recover from the trauma because this family member is someone I see frequently. My family is super Muslim so bringing up something like this in the open wouldn’t be appropriate and I would be somehow blamed for it even though I was around 4 years old when it started. Even just bringing up a very small part of my trauma once to my mom when I was 15 years old resulted in her saying that “we don’t talk about these things”. Police involvement, etc isn’t an option or something that I wish to pursue. 

After the first session, I was already starting to disassociate with the memories. By the 5-6 session I was completely forgetting and could make myself believe that it was a memory someone told me about but never actually happened to me. I started to even forget I sought out hypnosis a few months after. I have not even thought about this since but recently had a dream about the same hypnosis clinic. I make daily entries in an online journal so I was able to go back to entries made 3 years ago and read my daily experience and pretty much watch my progression with disassociating the memories. 

Just wanted to share my experience of hypnosis being extremely helpful and was wondering if anyone else has ever thought about seeking out help in this way?",skitzzxo,2019-01-18 07:09:30,3,351,41.58,26.54,84.4,25.77,21.94,20.23,92.02,59.26,15.38,9.4,8.26,0.28,0,0.85,0,5.98,6.27,13.96,9.4,10.26,6.84,2.28,17.66,4.27,1.71,1.14,2.56,1.71,4.56,2.28,2.28,0,1.14,0,7.41,1.42,0.28,1.42,0.28,16.52,3.7,2.56,2.28,4.27,1.71,3.42,1.71,0.85,0.28,0,1.42,0,1.14,0.28,0,6.55,2.85,1.99,1.71,0.28,0,7.98,6.55,0.57,14.81,1.42,5.13,8.55,1.99,1.14,0.85,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.12,3.7,0.57,0,0,0.57,0,0.28,0.57,0.85,0.57,0
ahbjnz,Does anyone have any tips on how to get through situations where you must be exposed to a trigger for prolonged amounts of time?,"So I was planning to do research with my academic advisor in the fall, but I have to take a specific class first (taught by him).  This class is first thing in the morning, two days a week.  Now, there is a girl in this class who suffers from Tourette Syndrome.  Her tics consist of very sudden, very loud, very shrill meowing sounds.  One of the stimuli associated with the trauma I experienced is loud, sudden noises.  To say that I was totally unprepared for what I was going to have to deal with in that class is an understatement.  I have worked very hard for years to control my visible/perceivable reactions to my triggers, and I am at the point where loud noises, usually just make me flinch or cringe or grit my teeth or squeeze my eyes shut.  I used to go straight into a full-fledged panic attack like the flip of a switch.  By the end of that class there was so much cortisol in my bloodstream and I felt so anxious and stressed that I had tears in my eyes by the end of class, just like the old days of being exposed to loud noises I'm not prepared for.  I have worked so hard to get past that, but at that moment, I felt like I was right back where I started.  

I know this girl cannot control her tics just as I cannot control my hypothalamus, amygdala, and HPA axis' responses to my triggers, and I get even more anxious because I don't want her (or anyone else) to feel hurt because of my reactions to her tics or report me to the dean of students for being rude or malicious toward an individual with a disability because that is not my intention at all.  I have no intention.  My brain does what it does, and I can't help it.  In other circumstances I would probably drop the class for another one, but I need to take this class if I want to do research in the fall.  I've already explained my situation to the professor, but that doesn't prevent me from being exposed to the trigger every few minutes, for 75 minutes straight, first thing in the morning, two days a week.  I don't want to take my xanax that often, but I also don't want my stress response to be triggered every four or five minutes while in class because it is obviously very physically and mentally taxing, and I'm concerned it might affect my ability to learn the class material.  Does anyone have any tips for how to calm myself down and get through this class?  

Again, I COMPLETELY understand that this girl cannot control her tics, that she has a disability, and that she is not doing anything of malice towards anyone, just as I have no malicious intentions involved with my reactions.  I have no issues with her.  I just need to get myself through this class, and that's my problem, not hers.",thedevilisaredhead,2019-01-18 07:27:46,11,530,39.9,10.32,70.04,4.6,25.24,17.74,92.26,61.13,19.25,12.45,10.38,0,0.19,1.89,0,6.79,5.09,15.09,9.43,6.04,7.17,2.83,16.04,3.4,1.13,1.51,1.89,1.89,2.64,0.19,2.26,0.94,0.38,0.57,4.72,0,0,2.26,0.19,16.04,1.51,5.09,1.89,3.58,1.51,4.34,4.15,0.57,1.7,1.32,1.32,0.75,0.57,0,0,5.28,0.19,1.32,2.08,1.51,0.38,3.02,11.51,0.75,11.7,0.94,5.28,5.66,4.91,0,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.26,3.58,5.28,0,0,0.38,0,0.19,0,1.89,0.75,0.19

ahclwc,Help?,"New to the sub, so sorry if this isn’t the right place to talk about this. 

I have C-PTSD from an extremely abusive home life that includes sexual abuse, physical and mental abuse as well as extreme emotional neglect. Then when I started dating, I must have had a sign on my forehead that said to take advantage of me because I’ve been assaulted/raped numerous times. I was stalked so much by an ex that I had to take a RO out, and my therapist thinks it’s smarter for me to just not date right now. I’m a 30 year old female and in addition to ptsd I have anxiety, DID and depression. I had to go on disability about 5 months ago because mentally I was struggling at work and becoming chronically suicidal. 

I’m doing much better now that they’ve figured out meds to a degree, however my doctors have a stipulation for me returning to work. I struggle being in open places, the park, taking a walk, etc. these places don’t have quick exits or places to hide, what if I become so overwhelmed that I have a panic attack and am nowhere near my car or personal space to breathe? It’s like playing a game of hide and go seek and I don’t feel I can stray far from home base because I need that safety net. Any suggestions for how to cope? I need to be able to do this before they’ll allow me to return (they don’t want me backsliding if I go back to work too early). I need help figuring out the  hyper vigilance aspect and how to cope in open/unknown spaces.

ahg1wn,So much success!,"First of all, I’ve posted here a few times in this past year and the understanding and support that I received has been absolutely wonderful! I’ve been given advice on how to deal with ‘normal’ incidents, how to explain things so people understand and when I had a massive knock back in November posting on here helped me through.

When I started EMDR I was given a ‘trauma score’ (this is what I call it, I actually have no idea what it is officially called) of 65. I was told that the number for ‘normal levels’ was 32. Basically, I had a long way to go to get better. I couldn’t see any end to it, I couldn’t sleep, I was jumping badly at every little thing. 

I was desperate. I needed it to stop. I went to my GP and got antidepressants, something I’d said I would never ever do. Alongside the EMDR (which was awful during the sessions but actually seemed to work really well for me), they slowly started making me feel better.

A month ago I stopped taking my antidepressants and I felt good! My friends were thrilled for me and seeing how excited they were, I was excited too.

This week I went to my therapy session and I was told that my scores were good and that I am OFFICIALLY in recovery!!

I’m so happy, I cant stop smiling, and after my session I went out to my car and cried. I feel like my PTSD started to define me these past few years. When I accepted it I was constantly trying to explain myself to people, trying to ‘get it out there’ that it’s not just military, that any traumatic event can cause it and it weakened me.

I’m so grateful that I had the strength to take action to help myself. 

I’m so grateful that my friends stood by me and that they honestly tried to understand what I was going through. 

I’m so grateful to my family who had no clue how to react but showed me how proud they were of me in their own little ways.

I’m so grateful that my therapists were able to teach me techniques that worked.

And I’m so grateful to this community who helped me through really difficult times, even the times when I couldn’t face talking to my friends.

ahhb79,I believe I have PTSD flashback but do not remember any trauma?,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

So for the past 6-7 years I have had this vision when I close my eyes that usually pops up after smoking pot (smoking way too much like oil) or doing psychedelics. I have had this vision at least 30 times now for 1-10 minute at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

I started to believe there was something wrong with me. Like maybe it's the vision of the future or that there is something wrong with me spiritually.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I think it might just be a traumatic memory I have had but don't recall.

&amp;#x200B;

This vision feels very intrusive in front of my eyes. It is accompanied by a vision of a person with paperwork in his hands walking from my left to my front as well as another person coming from the right. The vision is accompanied by this extremely weird and extremely uncomfortable feeling. Sometime's it is much more intense and it feels like pure dread. Like the ""matrix just collapsed in on itself/corrupted and I am still stuck in it."" That's the best way I can explain that feeling. It's very scary.

&amp;#x200B;

ahhc4d,I don't know if this actually happened to me or not. I need help understanding.,"&amp;#x200B;

2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. 

&amp;#x200B;

This ""new version"" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the ""original"" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.

&amp;#x200B;

 Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)

&amp;#x200B;

So what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a ""substitute"" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy?

ahirvq,Just feeling low,"I feel so tired. Today I went to the Dr because I was having stubble of a UTI. I'm out of town for work and couldn't get in to see anyone until mid afternoon and I felt like absolute shit because my symptoms had been going on for a day already. 

My boyfriend of three months had what we thought was a UTI a week ago. They gave him antibiotics and it seemed to get better but the day after he stopped the course his symptoms came back. His prostate is fine. 

My thoughts went immediately to an STI like chlamydia or gonorrhea. He's had a vasectomy and we're monogamous so we have unprotected sex. I have not had unprotected sex since 2008 or so when I was married. I typically use condoms for birth control because I can't tolerate the pill. Anyway. I had a full STI panel completed when I met my new boyfriend and everything was negative. 

So here we are three months later and I'm thinking he's fucked someone else. I'm freaking out about it, especially because he's so jealous that I can't ever mention past relationships or he covers his ears and wigs out. But he can talk about all his past shit. 

Right now I'm fixated on this friend of his I met on New Year's Eve who was a total skank. She was drunk as shit (it was only 10pm when we got there) her boyfriend was drunk as shit, and she was kissing and hugging all over my boyfriend. It pissed me off. At one point, he asked her how her relationship with her bf was going and she said it wasn't going well. He reached over and pinched her ear and said something like ""don't be so silly"" and it felt weirdly intimate. Like he looked like he was going to kiss her. I said,""what are you doing?"" And he said ""I pinched her ear."" I said ""why?"" And he said ""because she's being silly."" After I interjected, she turned around and started talking to some other chick at another table. 

I tried to talk to her and she completely blew me off. So I just gave up. She did stop hugging on my bf after that though. She actually left the table. Probably to get more drinks. 

My bf told her that she ""went crazy"" after her divorce and basically fucked a bunch of guys. He said he was her wing man.  She's a 55+ year old groupie for local bands/open mics. I find that pretty pathetic. 

My bf kept saying that he didn't know what she saw in her current man, because he wasn't her type. I said ""well, when you're a 50+ year old open mic groupie, that's the type you get."" My bf denied ever sleeping with her. I think he's lying.

the next day I did address that I didn't like how she was hanging all over him and he said that she does that when he ""brings people around"" - I assume other women. I had a panic attack before I could get up enough gumption to address it.  Then he kind of blew it off and started saying that he hardly hangs out with her at all, which I think is BS, because he talked about her a lot when we first met and she texted him to go see a Kix concert (yeah. Kix. She peaked in 1980.) He said he met her because his son dated her daughter. He always emphasizes that they are friends. But she seemed super possessive of him in a sexual, flirty way. It was odd. 

Anyway, I'm fixated right now on the idea that he fucked her while we started dating and she gave him an STI and now I have it. 

I'm also perseverating on an odd remark a waitress made when he introduced me to her. It's a local hangout he frequents. I think he used to drink a lot proper to meeting me. He told her I was his girlfriend and she said,"" now I know why you didn't sit in my section."" She didn't laugh, and she looked pissed off. She gave me the once over and glared at me. I asked him about it and he was very vague and acting like he didn't understand what I was getting at. I explained and he got defensive. All I said was it was an odd remark and asked him what she meant by it. He never did explain. 

I'm really angry right now and I may have no reason to be angry at all. I've been having escapist fantasies about just moving to another state and not telling anyone, killing myself, and admitting myself to the hospital. I'm perseverating on past traumatic experiences and cycling through everything bad that's ever happened to me in my life. 

I miss the life I had from 2005-2007. I think those were the happiest times of my life so far. I had friends, was confident. I've been really suffering since 2010 onward. I had six suicide attempts from 2011-2013. My husband at the time actually left me for dead and a friend called in for a welfare check (I left a suffice note on facebook.) I also left a note on the dresser. When the people came to do the welfare check he told them I was sleeping and went up to check on me. He had to have seen the note. He just went downstairs and told the cops I was asleep. My friend called the cops again and voiced concerns. They actually came back, forced they're way past him and took me to the hospital. I regained conciousness when they were carrying need down the stairs and recall my husband crying and then telling him to get out of the way. 

When I woke up at the hospital, I woke up to my ex doing sternal rubs and trying to keep me awake. I had an NG tube. For some weird reason that I still don't understand his secretary was there. He was basically putting on this show of trying to save my life after he'd basically left me for dead. 

I am so tired of trusting people only to have them let me down. I am so tired of having pain in my chest and daily panic attacks. I wish I would just die and then this would be over. This is not a life.

I'm doing EMDR but it's not working. My Drs took me off Xanax and put me on Valium. He keeps trying to wean me off of it but I have panic attacks so bad I miss work. He treats me like I'm a drug-seeking addict. 

I hate my life so much.

This is just me venting. I'm not going to kill myself. I just don't know what to do and I am so tired. I could try and file for disability but every time I try to look at my claim stuff I end up reliving the abuse. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far. I hope I didn't trigger anyone. I might call the helpline just to talk to someone.",Hanya34,2019-01-18 20:21:28,0,1209,15.09,62.34,47.3,8.17,12.59,12.82,93.3,61.04,24.57,19.77,9.93,0.58,0.41,8.35,0.5,4.8,4.38,11.58,9.84,6.87,8.27,1.82,21.84,3.23,1.57,1.82,1.24,1.65,5.13,1.82,3.31,0.25,1.65,0.5,17.7,0.5,1.32,3.8,6.04,11.25,2.32,1.82,0.99,2.56,1.65,2.81,3.06,0.66,1.82,0.5,4.05,1.16,2.07,0.83,0.41,8.44,3.47,1.24,2.15,1.16,0.66,11,8.93,1.08,14.89,1.74,6.87,6.45,0.66,0.83,0.25,0,0,0.5,1.9,0.99,0.5,0.08,0.17,0.17,15.55,7.69,1.57,0,0,0.17,0,0.33,1.49,3.56,0.5,0.25

ahjs24,Do you ever get upset with your partners for doing something you used to be abused for?,"I spent several years in an abusive relationship.  

I've noticed that when my boyfriend does something my ex would get mad at me for, or find suspicious, my brain tells me that it's something I need to be worried about - even if it's something I consciously know is fine. It's like the behaviors have been hardwired as bad things and it makes me feel like I'm acting like my ex when they stress me out.   

I guess as an example, my ex would fly off the handle if he saw me texting anyone and hadn't told him who I was talking to. When my partner texts people my first instinct is to wonder who it is he's talking to that he wouldn't tell me about because I now view that as something *normal to do in a relationship* even though I'm aware it is not, and I fear the worst because my ex treated me like the only reason I would talk to people without telling him was because I was cheating even though that was never the case. I deal with this by ignoring it until the feeling passes because I don't want to be like my ex.  

Idk. Sorry for the stream of consciousness. I just realized this is guiding a lot of my behavior.

ahjts6,My (22F) mental health has been downplayed and made fun of by my boyfriends brother and it’s causing me a lot of emotional distress.,"I dealt with a lot of mental, physical, and emotional abuse during my childhood from about age 4-17. I started going to a therapist in high school around the age of 14-15 and was diagnosed with ptsd and anxiety.

Most people in my life don’t know about everything I’ve been through or my diagnosis. I don’t really care to talk about it or open up enough with most people to tell anyone because I’ve had it used against me to many times. Usually if I do tell people it’s because I’m opening up to them and trust them on a level that I don’t with literally anyone else. 

I explained myself to my boyfriends brother hoping it would help him understand why I overreacted to the initial conversation and because he made fun of me for having a panic attack over the situation. 

I’ve tried to explain myself and to not make the situation worse but he doesn’t want to hear anything I have to say about anything. He told me he doesn’t care about me or anything having to do with me and said he doesn’t care about any mental issues I “claim” to have. 

It’s just completely gotten out of hand to where he is trying to lie about what really went on and make me out to seem like I’m something I’m not and also that I’m a person who uses mental illness as an excuse.

I don’t know what to do anymore and it has caused me a lot of emotional distress to the point where I attempted suicide because I felt like if I wasn’t around anymore my boyfriend and his family could have a relationship with said brother again and my boyfriend would be free of the burden of a girlfriend I constantly feel like I am. I clearly didn’t end up doing it but I still held the knife right up to my arm and pushed it down into my skin enough to where I could have done it. I’ve not attempted like this since high school and was happy that I forced myself out of the house in time. 

I contacted him and his wife recently attempting to have us all get together to talk this out to hopefully make things better and they both pretty much told me to go fuck myself. His wife who I thought was my friend told me “It’s adorable to me that you’re still trying to play victim. But we have a lot of other things to worry about than trying to find time to clear your guilt away. Im civil with (my boyfriend) because I’m not about holding grudges. At the end of the day I’m sorry mommy and daddy didn’t love you enough and you have to use “mental illness” as a way to get away with over reacting to things. But I’ve dealt with this situation and like I said last time I’m over it. Unfortunately (my boyfriend) and (his brother) relationship will never be the same because of this. Even if they cleared the air things would be different. But there’s nothing to talk out. The things being said here would be the same things being said in person and bringing it to (his parents house) would only make it worse and result in someone walking out and everyone being mad again.”

His brother told me that he pretty much is open to working things out with my boyfriend but he wants nothing to do with me because I ruined his family in his eyes. He wants it to go back to the way it was before he made me into a joke and if that can’t happen he’s not interested. He doesn’t want to hear anything either of us have to say and he just wants to be told he’s right. 

I refuse to let him get away with treating me he way he has but at the same time I just don’t know what to do anymore. It’s causing so much pain and upset for more than just me and my boyfriend but now his parents. I just don’t know what to do anymore and it’s pushing me into a headspace I’m trying to stay out of.

Also another important point, my stepmother who was my main abuser and my boyfriends brother are extremely similar in the way he’s been talking to and treating me. And I was in a relationship before this one where my boyfriends mother and younger sister didn’t like me purely because I didn’t come from money and they ended my relationship over it. So because of my past experiences I worry more because of the similarities.

I’m putting this in here so if anyone could give me advice that understands or just wants to respond please do. I’m really stuck",liljquimmy,2019-01-18 22:58:31,0,831,24.33,38.62,68.83,18.66,24.44,14.2,96.27,65.7,23.35,15.76,10.83,0.36,0.48,3.49,0.6,7.58,3.97,17.21,11.55,5.78,8.3,2.89,21.54,4.81,3.25,1.44,0.6,2.05,5.54,2.53,3.01,0.96,0.72,0.24,14.68,2.05,1.44,0.72,5.54,15.76,1.81,3.37,2.53,4.21,1.32,4.57,2.05,0.24,1.08,0.6,1.81,0.48,1.08,0.12,0,8.18,4.33,0.84,2.29,0.6,0.36,4.93,14.08,0.96,12.76,1.32,7.46,4.21,0.36,0.72,0.48,0.24,0,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0,11.67,3.97,0.36,0,0,0,0,0.24,0.72,5.17,1.2,0

aho3ig,Cold Sweats at night. Any advice?,"Hey friends! Just wondering if any of you have any advice on how to prevent cold sweats at night. 

I'm on Effexor (Venlafaxine) for daytime anxiety and it works great. I can run errands by myself now with only small levels of panic and I don't dread leaving my apartment. Trouble is one of the side effects is increased dreaming and weirder dreams. I've always battled nightmares but this medication ensured that I was getting them constantly, even for quick naps. I started vaping CBD/taking CBD pills and now I dream less and those dreams are not usually nightmares. However, I still wake up shivering cold and sweating and panicky quite frequently, even when I don't remember dreaming. I tend to quickly warm up after waking up, but it doesn't help my already significant lack of sleep and waking up sweaty sucks. 

Any advice on how to stop it or deal with it?

ahq8h5,"I'm having bad episodes, and I am not sure why or if it is even ptsd related. May be sensitive topic or trigger for someone,not sure.","Not even sure if this is a good spot to post this. 

I am in the works of looking for a therapist to find answers, but that has been an impossible quest. Anyway, I have been diagnosed with ptsd about 2 years ago but had been living with it for a long while. 

I try to explain this to my significant other, and I think my so doesn't understand. Seems to think I am just not able to control my emotions

Out of nowhere I get this feeling like my brain is being cheese graeted and I flip out. I spend 20 minutes screaming about how terrible this world is and how much I am tired of existing because of how screwed up living is. How no one gives cares about me (obviously not true since I am in a relationship) and I am tired of everyone and this world taking a dump on me. I'm not in the drivers seat when this happens... It just comes out in this long winded angry rant.  It is starting to strain my relationship. I have zero interest in hurting myself or anything. On the daily I try to find positive things about my life and these episodes just keep happening regardless of the positivity I add to  my days, and I have no idea why. 


I was diagnosed with ptsd 2 years ago but had it since I was much younger. These episodes are a whole new animal to me and I am trying to figure this out.

ahqi2y,"Did anyone else with PTSD who watched James' McAvoy's film ""Split"" find it weirdly inspirational?","I realize this might seems like a strange question. James McAvoy's character was obviously very fucked in the head. But there were parts of the story that I found strangely uplifting for anyone with a history of trauma. The idea that someone who went through horrendous trauma could basically modify their epigentic profile on such a radical level to create something like ""the beast"" based on pure belief about who they were...is pretty incredible. Also, the idea that he not only let the girl go with a history of self-injury and being molested, but basically called her the next step in human evolution/gave her this sense of power she'd never had before...was something to watch. Most of the time perpetrators prey on who they think are easy targets, people with a past history of trauma...and this was a complete reversal of that. There have been plenty of times when I didn't say a word about anything in my past, any trauma, but felt like assholes/psychos/creeps could smell it on me...maybe reading into some kind of body language or vibe I was giving off..and my instincts were always right on the money. I pick up on A, B, and C, quicker and quicker now and I don't give them the time of day, but still it seems like a never ending cycle of my version of swatting. For once it would be nice to not feel like a target or this unidentifiable ""other"" that the wrong people seem to see.

ahqs3x,PTSD episode on Dr. Phil,"So, recently theres this episode where he gives this woman with severe PTSD a chance at new experimental treatment.

I'm not sure what exactly he means, but he says hes connected to the leading PTSD researcher in the world who apparently said talk therapy isnt that effective and they think rewiring the brain is better. I wouldn't be surprised if this is true.

I'm just curious if anyone knows who exactly hes talking about? The discussion on the show was about finding a new way to cope because conventional therapy wasn't helping, he mentioned he would hook her up to the research.

Does that mean there are scientists trying to create a new form of treatment? I'm curious how much it would help. I'm not sure if something like that exists already, or something that purely and effectively helps rewire. I'm kind of wondering if they're doing trial runs or cases to test this out.

ahqssj,My boyfriends older brother has downplayed and made fun of my mental health and it’s causing me a lot of unwanted emotional distress *possible trigger warning*,"I dealt with a lot of mental, physical, and emotional abuse during my childhood from about age 4-17. I started going to a therapist in high school around the age of 14-15 and was diagnosed with ptsd and anxiety.

Most people in my life don’t know about everything I’ve been through or my diagnosis. I don’t really care to talk about it or open up enough with most people to tell anyone because I’ve had it used against me to many times. Usually if I do tell people it’s because I’m opening up to them and trust them on a level that I don’t with literally anyone else. 

I explained myself to my boyfriends brother hoping it would help him understand why I overreacted to the initial conversation and because he made fun of me for having a panic attack over the situation. 

I’ve tried to explain myself and to not make the situation worse but he doesn’t want to hear anything I have to say about anything. He told me he doesn’t care about me or anything having to do with me and said he doesn’t care about any mental issues I “claim” to have. 

It’s just completely gotten out of hand to where he is trying to lie about what really went on and make me out to seem like I’m something I’m not and also that I’m a person who uses mental illness as an excuse.

I don’t know what to do anymore and it has caused me a lot of emotional distress to the point where I attempted suicide because I felt like if I wasn’t around anymore my boyfriend and his family could have a relationship with said brother again and my boyfriend would be free of the burden of a girlfriend I constantly feel like I am. I clearly didn’t end up doing it but I still held the knife right up to my arm and pushed it down into my skin enough to where I could have done it. I’ve not attempted like this since high school and was happy that I forced myself out of the house in time. 

I contacted him and his wife recently attempting to have us all get together to talk this out to hopefully make things better and they both pretty much told me to go fuck myself. His wife who I thought was my friend told me “It’s adorable to me that you’re still trying to play victim. But we have a lot of other things to worry about than trying to find time to clear your guilt away. Im civil with (my boyfriend) because I’m not about holding grudges. At the end of the day I’m sorry mommy and daddy didn’t love you enough and you have to use “mental illness” as a way to get away with over reacting to things. But I’ve dealt with this situation and like I said last time I’m over it. Unfortunately (my boyfriend) and (his brother) relationship will never be the same because of this. Even if they cleared the air things would be different. But there’s nothing to talk out. The things being said here would be the same things being said in person and bringing it to (his parents house) would only make it worse and result in someone walking out and everyone being mad again.”

His brother told me that he pretty much is open to working things out with my boyfriend but he wants nothing to do with me because I ruined his family in his eyes. He wants it to go back to the way it was before he made me into a joke and if that can’t happen he’s not interested. He doesn’t want to hear anything either of us have to say and he just wants to be told he’s right. 

I refuse to let him get away with treating me he way he has but at the same time I just don’t know what to do anymore. It’s causing so much pain and upset for more than just me and my boyfriend but now his parents. I just don’t know what to do anymore and it’s pushing me into a headspace I’m trying to stay out of.

Also another important point, my stepmother who was my main abuser and my boyfriends brother are extremely similar in the way he’s been talking to and treating me. And I was in a relationship before this one where my boyfriends mother and younger sister didn’t like me purely because I didn’t come from money and they ended my relationship over it. So because of my past experiences I worry more because of the similarities.

I’m putting this in here so if anyone could give me advice that understands or just wants to respond please do.",liljquimmy,2019-01-19 14:00:42,3,830,25.06,39.54,66.85,17.07,25.15,14.7,96.39,65.3,23.25,15.66,10.72,0.36,0.48,3.49,0.6,7.59,3.98,17.11,11.33,5.66,8.31,2.89,21.2,5.06,3.37,1.45,0.6,2.05,5.66,2.53,3.13,0.96,0.72,0.24,14.7,2.05,1.45,0.72,5.54,16.02,1.81,3.49,2.65,4.34,1.33,4.46,2.05,0.24,1.08,0.6,1.81,0.48,1.08,0.12,0,8.43,4.34,0.84,2.41,0.6,0.6,4.7,13.98,0.96,12.77,1.33,7.35,4.34,0.36,0.72,0.48,0.24,0,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0,11.45,3.86,0.36,0,0,0,0,0.24,0.72,5.06,0.96,0.24

I didn't want them knowing where I worked because I was afraid they might tell my abuser and he'd start harassing me like he did my sister. I told my manager and I kept to the back until they left. My coworkers were so sweet and empathized with me. 

The whole time they were in the restaurant I was breaking down. My legs kept giving out. Fear, flashbacks, and anger filled my mind. I was nauseated and dizzy. 

I felt so embarrassed for my behavior at work. I've been doing so well to keep my troubles away from work that I couldn't help but feel disappointed in myself.

ahutza,Help with the 4th F - Freezing up,"So we all know the typical ""Exposure of people with PTSD to situations causing **Fear** causes them to go into **Fight** or **Flight** mode."" Except I think that often people neglect the fourth F - **Freeze**. As someone who experienced a lot of childhood abuse... I mean a lot. I never could fight nor could I flee so I'd freeze and take the abuse as that minimised the amount abuse I'd receive.


I tried to pen a letter to my family today and I'll be totally honest right now so anyone else reading this doesn't feel alone... I wrote four words before I blacked out, felt shattered, started shaking, hyperventilating, got the urge to start stabbing people, and then shat myself. Straight up - that's my mental state in response to fear I froze and shut down.


So after that I treated myself to a cheeky relapse today after a month clean and am comfortably high at the moment as this morning sucked... but I'm not going to let myself do that forever. So my question is what exercises or steps can I take to learn to overcome this mental shutdown? I'm already on meds I want advice on mental exercises that have worked for ya'll.

not to mention we have to have a valid excuse for why were lyfting off for a few hours in the middle of the day because i live with my mother and she cant know about my appointments. i think were gonna roll with getting lunch and doing some window shopping, but who knows, i just hope it ends up okay.

ahv81s,Question about symptoms,"I'm a 19 year old guy who has medically diagnosed PTSD and I have a question about something I've been experiencing. I want to know if this is a symptom or if it has a name or anyone has any tips on how to deal with it. Thank you in advance!

Often and especially when my friends, who I love more than anything, are trying to comfort me/ask me what's wrong/make sure I'm okay I find myself completely shutting down. I physically cannot speak and find it very difficult to move and especially cannot make eye contact or keep myself from retreating to a ball shaped position. These are things I do when I am having a flashback or am badly triggered but there's no accompanying flashback and I don't really understand why I might be being triggered. I hate it a lot because I can't communicate and only worry people even more. Is there a name for this shutting down kind of thing? And is it a PTSD symptom? It definitely seems at least PTSD adjacent. Does anyone know how to break out of it?

If it helps: my PTSD is incest and sexual abuse/rape related.

ahw201,An Ode to a Burning Star,"In living outside the moment, I miss it. I used to be able to be present, and then I was on high alert and everything started to change and turn dark. 

Bright on the outside, but from the inside of a burning star comes heavier and heavier materials as the energy at that core burns up, the force of my burning energy being consumed in order to hold my shape pushing against collapse under the force of gravity. In spending time with my wonderful girlfriend, I feel like my light can be seen, the force of my energy overcoming gravity in a supernova of love burning brightly and effortlessly outward in a flurry of colours. But the universe is cold and dark, and in its infinite dimensions the cosmos saps away at this energy over time, and this darkness is felt, because of the high contrast with the light. I need to escape, in the fear that everything I am will be consumed. I fear that fall into a false sense of security, and that if I allow myself to embrace it, and stop pushing against the universe, that it will consume me and that all things will end. But a star can’t control its own fate, and to fear the expanse of the universe is to remain trapped in a struggle outside of time, pushing for Aeons. 
I need to stop the fight and in a supernova, give myself to the universe and become a part of it.

I’m living a double life, where to the outside world I’m doing well. Succeeding to a high level, all because I’m pushing myself through step by step. The struggle is daily. At home I barely function at minimum, but maintain the ability to hold my life together around this. I’m not just painting the illusion of coping, because I’m not just coping, I’m excelling, I’m doing very well in my relationship, and my career. I can’t accept it easily because in my mind I’m not doing enough and am capable of so much more if I didn’t have a ball and chain around my ankle, or perhaps if I weren’t fighting with both hands behind my back. If I can do all this while held back, what great things could I truly be capable of. To be truly unleashed, like before my mental health truly came undone. Back when everything was easy, and I welcomed challenge because it allowed me a chance to shine, and even then I never showed my best abilities because I was too busy holding together a great secret and hiding it’s effects on me. 

I can do great things. My mind is brilliant, and the light inside me shines so bright. The light is a sun inside me, being harvested by the Dyson-Sphere built by the parasitic civilisation that is my secret shame. I was always looking at a way to run from my guilt, and although previously radiating within my solar system, more and more energy became sapped off as this great Sphere was built around me.

Now only the faintest glow of my ability shines through the solar system, but in that glow is still so much power that my presence is felt. I cannot be fully contained, and even this weak glow lights the lives of the people around me. It’s enough energy to meet their needs, and yet I can still be so much more. This is not a nostalgic rose-coloured glasses view of the past, or a delusion of grandeur.

This is now a turning point. Either the Sphere is completed around me, and the last of my glow is shrouded and I lay forever dark, consumed by my guilt and secret shames, or in one massive solar corona from within, I burst out, shattering the shrouded dome around me, fully unleashing myself and all I can be, glowing brighter than ever before.

I am a force to be reckoned with, limited only by myself. I am a fighter doing all I can to stir the fusion reactor in my core with the power of creation and destruction that I have held back. My time to shine has barely begun, and I will leave my lasting mark on the universe beyond my dying. I will explode brightly unto that infinite void and I will be seen. I can rock the universe to its foundations. I deserve to win this fight.",G1bs0nNZ,2019-01-20 01:31:51,2,747,60.01,9.72,96.11,66.32,21.34,16.73,88.89,60.51,16.06,10.98,10.84,0,0,0,0.13,5.09,7.9,15.53,9.64,5.62,8.17,1.34,13.52,4.42,2.14,0.4,0.54,2.14,6.43,4.28,2.14,1.2,0.67,0.13,2.68,0,0.13,0,0,10.58,1.47,2.41,1.2,1.47,2.14,3.48,5.22,3.48,0,1.61,1.47,0.27,1.07,0,0,7.1,0.94,1.87,3.35,0.94,0.67,2.81,9.5,1.2,17,2.01,10.17,5.22,0.94,0.27,0.13,0.13,0,0.13,0.27,0,0,0,0.27,0,12.72,4.55,6.02,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,1.87,0,0

ahxksf,I have to live in a house full of traumatic memories and I cannot cope,"TW: Childhood trauma, family violence, suicide 

So, to summerise the situation: I left my home not long after my 18th birthday last year. I wasn't really planing well I was just doing awful. The place has a lot of terrible memories and my mother and older brother both have personality disorders. My brother abused us both since his teens. I stayed at my boyfriend's and my dad's for a bit, but it hasn't worked out. My boyfriend and I are now back at my mum's. We are getting support to get cheaper housing from social workers, but in the meantime we have to stay here. It could take months.

Looking through my post history, you can see I attempted suicide a few days ago. My first and only real attempt. I have panic attacks daily. I feel like a totally different person. I'm angry and bitter. The stress is giving me physical symptoms too. Bad bowels, muscle pain, headaches. I snap at everyone. I can't sleep properly. 

My boyfriend and my therapist support me. I'm fortunate to have them, they are both fantatstic. But I made progress before coming back. I was in awful situations trying to live without a permanent home, but I was away from *that*. The first few weeks away were strange, getting used to not being scared all the time was scary. But I was happy despite that challenge cause I was optimistic for the first time in a long time. Now I'm back its like a nightmare. I can't do this again. 

I feel like the little girl who locked herself in her room with a pillow on her head trying to block out screaming. The sights, smells, sounds. Every fucking wall is a bad memory and I wanna gouge out my brain. I'm hypervigilante all the time and too much sound overwhelms me. I cry most nights. I feel like I decay just being here, being around my brother. He acts like he has changed but he hasn't. He yelled at me the other night for saying a Veterinarian is a doctor.

ahz3zk,Hopefully friendly and polite PSA about trigger warnings,"Hey y'all. I don't participate here often but have been reading for a long time, even before I had a Reddit acct. I've been medically diagnosed with PTSD and in regular therapy for 8 years. 

I'm not gonna respond to any of the trolls who occasionally pop up claiming that all TWs are ridiculous or attacks on free speech.

I know that sharing and writing out detail often helps both the OP and the readers. Folks can figure things out about themselves by reading someone else's gory detail about their symptoms etc and it is amazing and beautiful when that happens and everyone has the right and freedom to engage in posts like that. The suggestion that folks use TWs is not an attempt to prevent this freedom nor a debate about free speech as according to the US constitution, but a request for basic human decency. I believe TWs help freedom of speech flourish by making those who don't want to hurt anyone else with their words comfortable with fully expressing themselves, because they can do it in a marked and protected space that makes them feel OK about opening up only for those who want to read.

Please understand that it is part of the medical definition of PTSD that being reminded of trauma, including by reading words, can trigger an episode before the person has a chance to ""just stop reading"". No more than some of us can ""just stop hearing"" a noise can some folks just stop reading a blow by blow account of violence.

Also please understand that there are many causes and types of PTSD, and not everyone has the same triggers. So saying that TWs are unnecessary because everyone should expect to read triggering things when they come here doesn't make sense. When you come to this sub folks are sharing all kinds of traumas and if you are trying to be responsible and not trigger yourself, and not impose on others' rights to share everything they need to, you want to know the general content of a post before reading. Is it physical, mental, sexual trauma, or what? 

If you use this sub to post or read detail about trauma and you would like not to upset others, there is a simple way to do this.

""TW"", ""Possible Trigger Warning"", ""Graphic Content"" etc are not helpful. That's the part we know just because of where we are. We need to know what *kind* of content so we can know whether it triggers us or not, because again, there are so many types of triggers that there is no way this can be guessed or assumed.

It's also nice to signal whether you will be mentioning a type of trauma or going into graphic detail. Some folks seeking support for, say, abuse, may want- need- to read other posts from survivors for solidarity, but be *literally physically triggered* by the posts where someone describes how they were abused with detailed imagery.

Examples of what I've always understood is the most utilitarian way to TW:

TW physical abuse mention
TW child abuse graphic detail
TW in depth explanation of gaslighting
TW description of sex life
TW combat PTSD no details
TW self harm mention
TW graphic imagery of suicide attempt 
TW detailed description of panic attack effects

These warning should be typed in the title or first line of the post, so it's not possible to start reading the detailed content by accident when scrolling down the page. Sometimes I have seen something with a TW in the title and the the first line, readable right there on screen or mobile, goes ""When I was 6, x abuse and y abuse..."" That can still cause someone's episode.

I do understand that even putting the words ""sexual assualt"" or whatever is upsetting to some and it seems counterintuitive. But everyone who comes here does take a certain amount of responsibility on themselves to be around triggering content. What we can do to give our fellow PTSD survivors agency and power is give them the tools to navigate the content here, and make decisions about what they are prepared to read. If you use NSFW because you're afraid the mere words ""TW sexual assault"" would trigger someone, how  do you know they won't click on it because of your vague trigger and inevitable curiosity?

I hope this makes sense and doesn't offend anybody. I would love to hear what y'all think and if there's anything I failed to cover or suggest that's been bothering folks. I'm certainly not meaning to come at anyone who made a post like the ones I'm describing. I don't suspect anyone here of being uncaring toward fellow PTSD survivors. I think folks just haven't thought all this through because there's not a dialogue or an accepted Internet etiquette about it. 

This sub is wonderful but unfortunately I have several friends unable to use it because they keep clicking on random posts with unclear, or even optimistic, titles, and finding themselves immersed in graphic detail of their traumas.

I hope others out there are interested in discussing this and settling on ways to make all potential visitors here the most welcome.

Thank you for reading and I hope you all have a wonderful day :).",stripedagouti,2019-01-20 08:29:09,15,891,46.04,67.32,22.09,39.84,24.75,22,86.98,53.87,14.7,6.73,2.24,1.01,1.68,0,1.8,7.97,5.05,13.13,9.32,5.95,8.08,2.47,17.06,3.59,1.23,2.58,0.45,2.24,7.63,4.15,3.37,0.45,1.35,0.22,11.34,0.79,0.45,0,0.22,19.08,3.37,4.04,2.36,5.95,1.57,4.83,2.69,1.12,1.12,0.22,1.68,0,1.01,0.45,0.11,5.27,2.13,1.01,1.23,0.22,1.01,1.35,13.13,1.35,8.31,0.9,4.26,2.69,1.35,0.22,0,0.34,0,0.11,0.79,0,0.56,0.11,0,0,12.68,3.93,3.25,0.11,0,0.22,0,0.22,1.8,2.69,0,0.45
ahzi7q,A professional said I have cPTSD. But do I?,"A saw a therapist from 2014-16.  She was very helpful.  She had a PhD in psychology, but as far as I know, no medical degree.  I bring this up because she informally diagnosed me with autism spectrum disorder and cPTSD.  

I'm pretty sure the autism diagnosis was incorrect.  However, I keep running into weird things about how I think and act that fit with PTSD.  The most recent one I was made aware of is armoring.  This was much more of an issue with me when I was younger, but I thought it just went with being kind of high strung.  (I only found out it was a symptom in an askreddit thread just now.)

I understand the way to get a real diagnosis is to see a full on psychiatrist or something, but that's not my primary issue.

I feel like my life has been easy compared to so many other people's lives.  I do not feel I deserve to be as broken as I am.  I think that if I were to get a diagnosis, I'd just look at it like a doctor getting paid to make me feel better about being weak by medicalizing what for me (but not those who have gone through real trauma) is a character issue.",somehappyendings,2019-01-20 08:54:09,6,222,40.48,6.3,93.68,42.09,14.8,14.86,88.29,59.91,18.92,12.61,11.26,0,0,1.35,0,6.31,6.76,13.96,10.81,5.41,8.11,1.8,22.07,8.11,5.41,1.8,1.35,1.8,3.6,2.25,1.35,0,0,0,3.15,0,0,1.35,0,15.77,6.31,1.8,0.45,2.7,0.45,5.41,3.15,1.35,0.45,1.35,5.41,0,5.41,0,0,4.5,0.45,0.45,2.25,1.8,0,7.21,12.61,0,9.01,1.8,5.41,1.8,1.8,0.45,0,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.51,6.31,2.7,0,0,0.45,0,0.45,0,1.8,1.8,0

This has helped me a lot with my trauma (although, it may be directing the anger at myself rather than my abusers). I didn't realize that it might be damaging until I read ""The Wisdom of the Enneagram"" and diagnosed myself as a 9.

I found out that I know a rapist last night. She raped a man who was under the influence and couldn't say no. He was hurting incredibly badly the next morning while she teased him about not being able to get hard in front of their friends. After asking her to stop, and her continuing, he eventually slapped her. She sees no wrong in what she did, and she sees herself as the victim in the big picture. This guy slapped her, which makes HIM the baddie.

I can't handle this. I can't handle this because she is a psychology major who brags about how good she is at psychology. She is self absorbed and ignorant and just... gone. She has trauma about men hitting her, but I have trauma about sexual assault, and at least I'm scared to be a therapist because I know my worldview is altered!! At least I can acknowledge that!! So, yeah, the slap must have hurt and made her terrified and brought up bad memories and a lot of pain but!!! But the giant blindspot in her evilness can't be forgiven. 

This... hurts. I kinda thought that maybe my abusers would feel for their actions, but now I see that someone can be blind to it. They can be so wrapped up in their own desires that empathy can't get through. They see the bad things they do as good because it is good for them. I think I might be angry not only at her but at the people whom abused me, which I don't think I have ever been. I'm mad because maybe they don't see the error or the feel the guilt.

ai51zo,"TW Pedophilia, grooming, police, depression, CP mention etc. What is the best way to report a online pedophile to the police, how do I cope with this feelings","I’m really upset right now. Sorry. 

I want to report my abuser to the police. I am constantly having flashbacks. I am upset over this every day. I want it to stop. I’m angry and hurt and question everything every day. 

I was groomed by someone 4 years older than me when I was underage. After I cut her off one year ago I found out she is mostly friends with pedophiles online now who draw child porn. She also draws child porn. This broke me and every single day I feel like I’m going insane. I tried to threaten her that I would report her to the police. Didn’t work and she’s still online. I told her family what disgusting things she draws and about her friends. Didn’t work and she’s still online. I don’t know what else to do. I just wanted her to go away from where I am online and she hasn’t.  I can’t take this it drives me insane. I just wanted her to go away and she won’t. 

I’ve been keeping my feelings away from my family because I don’t know if they’ll be angry. They tend to blame me for a lot of things. I’ve been keeping all of this in for a year and I constantly feel like
I’m going to explode. She thinks she is untouchable because of her pedophile friends online who are in a gigantic circle jerk telling each other they’re not doing anything wrong by looking at cp. I try to stop thinking about what happened constantly and I can’t, and I’ll even dream about it. Every day. I feel like I can’t rest until I get justice, and I try and try and try to get it and I DONT. She gets to enjoy her life with no consequence while I struggle every single day and lose hours and hours of the day to how broken my mind is 

I haven’t contacted police yet. Because I don’t know which way I should. Cybertip, or fbi, or local. She is in a different state from me. This all happened a little over 1 year ago. I wrote a very long document going into detail of many things she did. I have a few screenshots of her sexts and the porn she sent me when I was underage. I can remember everything vividly and recounted everything vividly in what I wrote. I don’t know if that’s enough. I don’t know how seriously people take just recollections of events. I’m tired

I heard from some places that cybertip doesn’t take things seriously or it would take forever for cybertip or fbi to reach me. I don’t know what a local police would or could do about it and I’ve heard that sometimes they don’t care. I also don’t know how to see them without my parents knowing. Does anyone have any experience doing any of these things for sexual abuse or something similar. Should I send them the document I typed.  Does anyone know how things work when a pedophile is reported to the police. Or any similar experiences to mine and how to cope with it. Anything.

ai56pj,The Butterfly Effect Movie: Who/Where would I be if the abuse never happened?,"The Butterfly Effect Movie: Who/Where would I be if the abuse never happened?

I just watching The Butterfly Effect Movie for the first time and it was incredible and very thought-provoking. In the film, the main character attempts to go back in time to change traumatic events he went through. While his intention was to change the traumatic events to create a more positive life for himself and others, he often ends up harming others by meddling with the past.

As someone who has complex PTSD/ BPD, I often wonder where I would be if I didn't go through the abuse I went through. What if my mom saved me from my dad and all of the sudden put her children first and had empathy? What if my parents didn't put all their anger on me for their marital issues? Or what if the covert sexual abuse didn't happen between my dad and I? Or what if I wasn't a mixed race woman with all my racial identity issues? What if I emancipated from my parents as a teen and never looked back? Where would I be? Would I have secure attachment and have plenty of healthy relationships? Would I have been in a long term relationship with a man and am now happily engaged (I am 26)? Would I have been an actress, dancer and performed in music videos and in shows? Would I have chosen another career instead of trying to be a therapist because of my trauma?Would I have had a higher self-esteem because I did not have to face the discrimination and racial identity issues I have had? Would I no longer have my hormonal and digestive issues? Would I be prettier and more healthy looking? Would I have longer hair? Would I look younger? Would I have studied abroad in college, traveled after college, and then moved to London or Italy? Would I have had a close relationship with my sister and brother like best friends? Would I be less child-like and more mature?

The truth is, none of the above is guaranteed. And if I wasn't targeted for the abuse, the abuse may have been turned on my brother and sister. I would never wish this on them.

On a positive note, everything I mentioned above, I can still obtain through hard work through therapy and behavioral changes. I am happy I am alive, have the self awareness I do and the motivation to change. I probably would not be as self-aware, proactive, assertive, hard-working, and understanding towards survivors of abuse as I am now if I did not go through what I did.

But there is still this ""what if"" inside of me? What if someone saved me from that abuse, where would I have been now?

Anyone else wonder what they would be like without the abuse they endured? Any positive outcomes of the hardships you went through?",journey1992,2019-01-20 18:02:26,9,507,25.93,14.34,68.34,22.71,15.36,17.16,92.7,63.51,16.96,12.43,10.26,0,0.2,0.99,0.99,4.54,6.31,11.83,14.6,4.54,9.07,2.96,19.92,5.92,3.55,3.35,0.59,2.17,5.33,2.56,2.76,0,1.97,0,8.09,1.78,0.2,0.99,1.78,18.34,2.17,2.76,6.51,5.13,2.56,5.72,2.37,1.18,0.2,0.39,2.17,0.2,0.99,0.2,0.79,6.51,2.17,1.97,1.78,0.99,0.2,5.72,9.27,0.59,13.21,3.16,5.52,4.93,1.58,1.78,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.61,1.97,3.16,0.39,0,4.73,0,0.99,0.39,0.99,0.39,0.59

ai6pp3,Combat related problems,"My PTSD stems from a 6 month tour in Afghanistan back in 2009. Specifically one day where I lost my best friend and I nearly lost my own life. Lately I have been having nightmares replaying the events of that day. I usually wake up screaming and clutching my left leg which I sustained a GSW that day. It has been really hard for me to cope with it. There are times I wish I would have not made it home. It is really hard for me to go out in public and not get scared. Also I have a massive fear of people in traditional Islamic attire. When I see people dressed like that I have flashbacks and just start crying. Which makes me feel worse because I feel like an asshole for assuming people’s intentions just because of what they wear. I see a counselor once a week and we are going through EMDR.

ai75vh,I feel like the trauma never ends,"I have been suffering from PTSD since I was at least 12. At least, that's how I think it is. My memory before the age of 15 is very foggy. I am 17 now. Anyway, it seems as though I can never escape trauma. I have been displaying dissociative symptoms since the age of 9 or so, for unknown reasons. I'm guessing that's how old I was when it started, but I can't be too sure. The earliest trauma I can remember is watching my grandpa die when I was 12. Since my parents didn't believe I was suffering from any mental illnesses, it went untreated. I was finally diagnosed at the age of 16. Knowing my diagnosis, I believed I could finally move on. And I almost did. That was until my mom died a few weeks ago. I saw it happen. There was so much blood. I can't look at ambulances, hospitals, or blood without remembering and having a panic attack. I saw her waste away and die for 3 years. Anyway, my point is, I don't feel like I will ever be able to move on from the pain in my life. I've been suffering so much for so long that it's almost impossible for me to focus on my future. I should have been developing talents all these years, but instead I was trying not to snap and kill myself.  I'm smart (my grades don't reflect this so nobody cares), and I'm decent at some things, but I am never satisfied with anything I do. I feel like i will go nowhere in life. I'm a total burnout. It hurts so much because there was hope for me to succeed before everything came crashing down around me. I'm tired of the pain. The only way out I can see is to kill myself. But I know that is not an option, because I will only traumatize my family more. I feel as if my life is over. It's too late for any improvement or redemption.

ai7ktt,Let's share secrets.,"I've been known as secretive or mysterious by those around me. So much of my life has been hell that most of their normal stories I have a fucked-up counterpart for. So I stay silent. But I've never really told anything about what I've seen or experienced to anyone no matter how close. To most I'm. Just a cynical hateful old man despite being only 26 lol

Lately I've started waking up in a panic again, running through the house like a maniac checking the rooms and making sure everything is okay. I've started attacking people when they wake me up or I hear a noise. I think sometimes I'll imagine a noise in my sleep.

The anniversary of my child dying is coming up and while I acknowledge it I think I've suppress it. I want to cry but can't, I want to scream but hold it in. Every day I have to restrain myself because I just want to start punching holes in walls and breaking shit. Everyone sees me as moody but there is so much to unpack underneath it all. Surely they know something bad has happened in my life previously, that this isn't normal behaviour.

If only they knew of the monster right under their noses. I've contemplated killing myself more and more recently. It's just been a fleeting thought but it's become evermore pervasive, popping into my head for no reason all the time. 

My SO doesn't know and I wouldn't burden them with it. They must know something is up but not the extent. I can't find the will to get help. I can admit to myself something is wrong but not others. It's exponentially harder to carry something like this alone.

There is a sadness in me that I can't feel. A part of me broke as a kid and it's beyond repair. One thing after another. I've seen too many people die to count. My only solace lies in the fact that as long as I stay silent those around me don't have to imagine the horrors.

Fear

That part of me that nearly stops me getting on the plane. 

That part of me that makes my hands shake and my heart race walking home alone at night. 

That part of me that won’t accept drinks off a random at a party.

That part of me that keeps me up at night thinking about people rejecting or abandoning me. 

That part of me that sits at the back of my mind when I’m at work telling me it’s all over and they’re going to let me go soon. 

That part of me that makes me panic until I forget who I am whenever someone touches me unexpectedly.

That part of me that stops me taking risks.

That part of me that holds me back in so many different ways, that never really leaves.

That part of me that also protects me, more so now than ever before.",astral_berry,2019-01-21 06:19:31,0,205,13.2,12.09,99,12.76,14.64,8.29,95.61,63.9,29.76,16.59,14.63,0,1.46,0,0.49,13.17,2.93,14.63,6.83,9.76,6.34,1.46,15.12,2.93,2.44,2.93,0.49,6.34,6.83,2.93,3.9,1.95,0,1.46,6.83,0,0.49,0,0.49,12.2,1.46,1.46,1.95,3.9,1.95,3.9,1.46,0,0,0.98,2.93,0.98,0.98,0,0.49,6.83,1.46,0.49,1.46,0.98,2.44,2.93,8.29,1.46,17.07,2.44,7.8,7.8,1.46,1.46,0.49,0.49,0,0,0.49,0,0.49,0,0,0,10.73,6.34,1.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.93,0,0

&amp;#x200B;

I tried watching the GreenLeaf TV show on Netflix and I was so triggered! I will not watch another episode. It reminded me so much of my family situation. Where the truth-teller of the family is scapegoated. Also, how someone in the family was sexually abusing a family member and everyone kept quiet about it except the truth-teller. Ugh!!!!!!! It actually seems like a really good show but it is too triggering. I went to bed in a bad mood and had nightmares about my own family and abuse.

aibgo3,How to deal with my reactions to people at work?,"I have been diagnosed now for 4 years and only just getting the real help I need. I finally have a job with a supportive management team, I've had to take a step down to a calming job. I have lovely colleagues however, I'm struggling with a couple of them...

One of them is near retirement, he's a bit sarcastic and likes to shout. He has 'told me off' jokingly a few times and every time he has I've jumped out of my skin, developed full physical symptoms and he just laughs and I laugh back. Then I just feel broken for the rest of the day or ready to cry/run away. 

Another one questions what I'm doing a lot, she's just a bit nosy and does it with everyone. Thing is I hate explaining myself when I don't have to, but the people pleaser inside me starts getting flustered, trying to explain everything. This again leads to intense physical feelings and paranoia... I know she is just joking- it's normally comments like 'why are you finishing early, your never here'.. I'm there all the time so she's definitely joking but it's my reactions that are just all wrong. 

I've started feeling myself become more reclusive at work, avoiding the louder ones.

So.. I've spoke to my manager and she said I'll get used to them and she is there for me.

 I know my reactions aren't the norm but I can't help but feel irritated and angry they would make me feel that way... which I know they aren't doing on purpose. 

Does anyone else have these issues in day to day working life? 
Also, should I tell my manager that this is how bad it's making me? 

I don't want people to make exceptions for me, I don't wanna be that person people are awkward around in case they 'set me off'.

aicpzs,My doctor violated medical confidentiality,"I needed to send a medical report to a disability rights organization I joined some years ago. I told my neurologist I was enquiring about disability rights and that my general practicioner is and will not be informed about any of this. How my psychologist and psychiatrist are responsible for my treatment. He was the only doctor who knew of my autism and PTSD diagnoses. I told him I had a deadline. For weeks, I made appointment after appointment and call after call, because he wouldn’t write the report he agreed to write.


He now not only sent my GP a copy. He addressed the report to him and I was the one merely getting a copy. A report that is highly confidential and was written to be send to a court of law by me and me alone. It starts of with “Presuming you are familiar with the following diagnoses and treatments of your patient...” .  

He was not available to personally speak to me today, but his practice confirmed in front of a witness that I never signed a release clause with them, which is irrelevant anyway, as I verbally withdrew consent.

My first step was damage control. I showed up at the GP 10 minutes before they opened up, after a sleepless night. When I explained the situation to them, the nice lady working there immediately informed the GP and handed me the original report. My diagnoses and treatments were highlighted with a marker by my GP.  He read the entire report. I am not someone who cries easily, but I had been feeing very sick all morning and outside the practice, I just started bawling. I still feel completely powerless and violated. Drained.

I am writing a report to the state medical board. I was also adviced by multiple people to get the police involved, as these seem be two reportable crimes in my jurisdiction. And no, I don’t live in the US. 

The sad part is that I only told him of my diagnoses because he claimed I “seemed heavily depressed” and that “his intuition” is never wrong. That I “must be suicidal”. I’m not. He said I need therapy. I told him I am already getting it. When he asked what for, I told him autism. And I think that he was very embarrassed there for a moment. He started stuttering and said that my “autistic body language” must have thrown him off.

To add insult to injury, the report itself also includes many mistakes and omits important details and won’t be very useful for the court. 

I know this is bad for my health, bad for my recovery. Every other patient would feel violated now. But I feel like a little child again. Every single time I ask a professional for help, it backfires horribly in some form. I rarely ask any longer and I end up regretting it every time.",oldschooldyingcat,2019-01-21 10:00:54,5,492,40.29,39.57,44.19,2.48,13.3,19.72,87.4,56.71,20.33,15.85,10.57,0.2,0.41,4.07,0.61,4.47,6.71,10.98,7.52,5.49,6.5,2.24,16.87,3.25,1.63,1.42,1.02,2.85,5.08,1.22,3.86,0.41,0.81,1.02,11.38,0,0,0.2,4.07,10.37,3.25,1.02,1.63,1.42,2.03,1.83,1.63,0.2,0.81,0.61,3.46,0.61,3.05,0,0,5.28,0.61,1.22,2.44,0.81,0.61,7.32,8.74,0.41,10.16,1.22,2.85,6.1,5.28,0,0,0,0,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,0.2,13.82,7.93,3.05,0,0,0,0,0,2.03,0.81,0,0

I avoid triggers, I give space, I support whatever mental health days he needs, I rarely ask questions anymore a except, ""Do you want to talk about that"" or ""what do you need"" or ""what do you think happened to trigger that"" and even that will get me yelled at.   


Today we made plans to go to lunch and work through this worksheet our therapist gave us. I asked him about it twice and we were a go. He called at noon and said he wasn't in the right headspace. We had a really good night and everything was fine and this morning he wasn't in the right headspace and feels bad about himself. Okay, I support you taking the time you need to go do what you need to do to work through that. But I'm disappointed that we aren't going to do what we planned and I'm feeling a little bit like my feelings are getting steamrolled and things that aren't about him and his headspace are getting ignored. When I tried to calmly express this and say I support you doing whatever you need, but I'm feeling a little unsure of what's going on and I am trying to tell you as my partner that I don't feel there's ever a ""good"" time to talk about stuff, I got a l ot of ""i'm sorry my feelings aren't on your schedule"" and ""i'm sorry I can't get my shit together enough to make you happy."" None of which I said.   


So I guess what I'm struggling with is it selfish to share my thoughts and feelings? I understand that in an ideal world, I would wait until he was ""In the right headspace"" but that literally seems to be never. And when he is, I'm trying to just enjoy it and be in the moment. So when do I get to not even have my needs met, but get to express what they are and what feelings I have? I'm starting to wonder if I'm even loved as a person or if I'm just a security blanket?

Due to unfortunate circumstances I had to quit a few good paying jobs in the past. Long story short I recently lost a job a few months back due to my narcissistic mom who I live with. I used to live on my own for 5 years until I got severe PTSD.
I've been struggling with finding jobs but the only one that has called back so far is a housekeeping hotel job only paying 8.89 an hour. That's the lowest I have ever been paid since working as a teen. Almost 4 dollars lower than what I'm used to. 
I'm very upset but other people told me just to take the job. What makes it worse its a job where I have to stand outside in the freezing cold because it's one of those outdoor motels and the hours are uncertain. I have a clean resume with hospital cleaning and other cleaning services but I'm not getting callbacks anywhere else. 
Like I said circumstances led me back to living with my mom. I got very sick, had panic attacks, and can't live on my own right now. I want to get away from her but my disability barely allows me to feel anything but negativity and hopelessness.

It’s been about 5 weeks since I took the last dose. I felt fine for about 3 weeks before I noticed my memory start to forget the trauma. 

I didn’t feel depressed in fact I felt peaceful and calm. Now I’m at 5 weeks and my memory is gone and my anxiety (shaking) has just begun. 

I feel very tired and fairly flat. 

I can feel my heart racing and my body feels tense. 

I have loaded up on good food and supplements and I’m sleeping well but this feels really unsettling. 

I am most concerned that the part of my memory that has my trauma memory has gone blank which makes me terrified it’s going to come back in a huge bang or it won’t come back until I’m on another anti depressant leaving me with a waiting demon.

aifovy,Horrible Car Crash months ago when I had a learners permit,"Hello, I’m an 18 female, was 17 in November. 
I was in a horrible car crash, probably the worst you could get in and walk away from just to give some description. 

It was on the 19th of November. My 14 year old sister had emergency surgery on her intestine. My dad got banged and bruised badly and still feels it a bit. I felt only a little sore, but I can’t get it out of my head. It’s like an ongoing battle. At first, I thought of the crash itself, then I thought about other crashes, then I thought about scenarios not even related to cars (examples would be: what if I randomly lost the ability to use my legs and fell and busted my teeth out? Or What if the entire world collapses?). I get very nervous when others drive, I can’t help but think of how close we are to the other cars and how fast we are coming up to a red light. I end up pinching myself or doing this weird slurping noise with my mouth. 

The images have gotten better, though if anxious they could get bad.

I had managed to drive and pass my drivers test with an 84. Haven’t driven on the road since I took the test, only an empty parking lot and I felt fine.

Yesterday, my dad surprised me with a 2019 civic (he wanted to get something with high safety ratings)  and today he wants me to drive 5 minutes up the road to my job with him in the car. I’m trying to think like “I pay the insurance, it’s a smaller car than my dad’s, I like the way it drives, very good safety ratings, I drove from Kilgore through Dallas for hours so I can do this” basically to hype myself up. My dad does not want to enable my behavior because he knows it can get worse with time.

Anyways, I’m just trying to get some advice. Please help, I’m really tired of being this anxious all the time.",kennaks3,2019-01-21 14:14:44,0,356,56.85,14.92,96.3,8.82,17.8,12.36,91.01,55.9,17.98,13.2,10.67,0.56,0.28,1.4,0.28,4.78,7.02,13.76,7.3,5.62,7.02,1.4,16.29,5.34,1.97,1.69,1.97,1.69,5.9,2.25,3.65,1.4,0.28,0.56,5.9,1.4,0,0.84,2.25,14.61,3.09,1.97,2.53,3.65,0.56,5.06,1.97,0.84,0.28,0.84,2.25,1.4,0.84,0,0,11.24,1.69,2.53,3.09,3.37,1.4,5.06,10.39,1.12,16.85,4.49,6.74,5.9,1.69,0,0,0.56,0,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,0.28,15.17,5.06,4.78,0.28,0,0.56,0,0,0.56,2.81,1.12,0

aikc64,"MILD TW: SEXUAL ASSAULT Whenever I heat muffled voices/noises from other rooms or outside, I immediately believe something horrible is happening.","If I hear a shout outside, I assume someone is being attacked. Considering I am a college student at a large party school, 99.9% of screams on the street are by intoxicated idiots.

If I hear one of my roommates crying, I assume she just received some sort of horrible news or is suicidally depressed.

If I hear a conversation getting heated, especially if a male voice is getting very loud, I am struck with fear. Even though that situation could be literally anything and it’s not even my business.

What annoys me the most is that if I hear one of my roommates having sex, I get scared it’s actually them getting assaulted. We are all very sexually active women and 3/4 of us have a steady boyfriend. I have no issue with sex. I have it all the time. But because I was once a victim I get really scared.

I feel guilt more than anything. That I may very well be ignoring a horrible situation I could prevent. If something horrible was happening and I assumed nothing was wrong and didn’t budge, I would be directly responsible. A bystander.

At this moment I hear thumps from my neighbors upstairs and I heard a female voice. Turns out the voice was just the wind. Yet for a while I was paralyzed with fear.

Whenever I try to talk myself down and remind myself logically I have zero evidence this is really a horrible thing going on, it doesn’t work. Because I feel like even if there’s only a 1% chance someone is in danger, I am compelled to drop whatever I’m doing and step in.

aikynv,Dealing with Roommates and Insignificant Triggers,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I've never posted here before, so apologies if this isn't a proper post.

&amp;#x200B;

I am living with roommates found online in a small, two-bedroom apartment. My wife and I share one room, this other couple shares the second. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife is out of the country working on visa paperwork, so I'm here alone with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

The roommates are largely okay but very controlling and annoying about what ought to be done. When my wife was here they would needle her about every little thing (the light was on in the hallway, there is water on the bathroom floor, the fridge door was slightly ajar). Nothing they complained about was outright ridiculous, but there was some new thing every day for months, and they wouldn't tell her in a kind way. The boyfriend would tell her and then wait expectantly for her to go ""fix"" whatever insignificant issue there was, watching her the whole time as if he's the boss. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that she is gone, they are still doing the same thing. Not as often, and for some reason they even still text her to tell me to do something.

&amp;#x200B;

So, the point of this story: 

&amp;#x200B;

I largely avoid conflict with them (eg., saying no, telling them to take care of their issues themselves), because I get all worked up and anxious when I have to deal with it. The troubling thing for me is that this is not reflective of my character at all. I am a professor who has lived abroad for many years, I am comfortable arguing or debating with others and dealing with conflicts in a classroom or professionally, I know how to box and fight and am not terribly afraid of physical violence (no more than the ""normal"" person, I mean), I am a big guy, feel confident in myself physically and mentally, etc. Point being, I am at least self-sufficient in most meaningful ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that the second I enter my home, all of this melts away. I immediately revert to the same level of insecurity and anxiety I had as a child growing up in an abusive home. I even sometimes will catch  myself in the mirror and be shocked at my size (I am only 6'1"", \~220) -- not because i'm a huge man or something, but because internally I am literally feeling myself to be a small child again. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, the real point of the story:

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any recommendations for dealing with this anxiety? I can't seem to find ""myself"" when I'm home, and it's a strange feeling. I have this dreadful sense of something bad looming around the corner, but I know rationally that nothing will happen. I just can't seem to shake or deal with the feeling(s). 

&amp;#x200B;

I realize on rereading that this is a little jumbled -- hope it makes a little sense.",Throwaway1123124235,2019-01-22 00:48:32,0,510,43.23,33.31,76.29,2.75,22.17,16.08,87.84,57.06,16.86,10.98,7.45,0,0,1.57,1.96,5.88,6.86,12.35,9.61,5.88,7.65,2.55,16.47,4.9,1.96,1.37,1.37,2.75,5.69,1.57,4.12,1.57,0.98,0.2,9.61,0.59,0.98,1.96,0.78,13.92,3.53,1.76,1.57,3.73,1.96,3.92,1.76,0.39,0.2,0.78,0.98,0,0.78,0,0.2,6.67,1.96,0.59,3.14,0.59,0.78,2.55,11.37,1.18,13.53,1.18,8.43,3.73,1.37,0.2,2.35,0.2,0,0,0.2,0,0,0.2,0,0,26.27,4.31,5.69,0.39,4.31,0.2,0,1.18,1.37,2.16,1.96,4.71
ailh32,Getting help making things worse,"TW: sexual assault

So I went to the dr a couple weeks ago, and I’ve been feeling better over the past few days, but was in a horrible slump right after and a few weeks or maybe over a month leading up to the appt. Getting out of bed was harder, my depressive symptoms were slowly creeping back up, and I was getting a lot of migraine and back pain. I have fibromyalgia and arthritis and it seems everything aggravates it, but more recently, I’ve noticed when I take my adderall it makes things 10xs worse (since it’s a stimulant I know my muscles tend to tense and i have tmj so I crack my jaw all day and notice my temples hurting and headaches sometimes coming from there) I’m also on a smaller dose of duloxetine cause I was trying to get off of it. The adderall was given to me by a fckd up, ageist, discriminatory psychologist (only one I’ve ever seen) and she thought i had add. I was only recently diagnosed with ptsd when that probably was my diagnosis to begin with as a child, but definitely after the sexual assaults/rapes at 15, 24, and 25 (I’m 26 going on 27 now). I finished CPT therapy a few months ago and it’s done WONDERS for my self harm, suicidality, hypervigilance, and self worth, but this nagging leftover dissociation and feelings of anxiety and depression have left me useless with work, even with taking loads of adderall each day and drinking black tea after that (which doesnt do much for me anyway). I got referred to a therapist that does emdr after I went to the dr for gastrointestinal issues (my pcp has been my family dr since I was little and downplays all my symptoms because I “look okay”) and this lady actually listened. She asked all the right questions about my traumas and gave me the right referrals and I cried most of the appt without wanting to or being able to stop (side effect of healing I guess?) and she heard me out completely, which is what I’ve always wanted, but I could help but feeling worse after. I’m semi hopeful now, and I’m going to follow thru with the referrals, but I’ve been procrastinating so much and have a hard time sleeping and waking and eating and overeating and my vivid semi disturbing dreams have come back full force. My ptsd went from a 67 to a 29 when I was done with cpt in November 2018, and my depression was still moderate-severe and my anxiety was within the clinical range as well. I can’t help but think that some symptoms have some back, maybe some underlying mistrust of myself and others since I haven’t had good experiences with the medical system as a woc, but I’m just not sure what to do to help in the immediate moment. I’m from a small town so mental health isn’t exactly the top conversation, and to top it off I work as a therapist so everyone just assumes I’m over everything I’ve gone thru. Any advice or kind words or just real statements to help me through this weird time? Side note for context, I just realized I had been raped those 3 times during the spring of 2017, a couple months after the last rape, so I’m fairly new to processing this type of trauma, which I try to give myself credit for in the grand scheme of things.

aim4o2,"I hate my sister in law for her insistence she has PTSD, and I hate myself for thinking this way.","For twelve years as a child I was sexually and physically abused, even told to kill myself by my own mother. I ignored all my symptoms for years but after seeing my best friend kill himself, it all surged and I sought help, and my psychiatrist told me I have PTSD. 

I shared this with my husband and his family, who are like my only family since my mother was a single mom and did a lot of the abusing. 

My sister in law immediately went off about how I couldn’t possibly have PTSD. She said SHE has PTSD from her exboyfriend. 

Her story is she got with a crummy guy for several years. They had a kid together, making her have her second. She left both kids with my in laws and moved to Texas to live with the boyfriends grandparents. 

She says they both beat each other up, and did drugs like meth and heroin. She reached out to us all after telling her entire family she hated them and they were useless and even accused her father of molesting her because he used to spank them on their bare butt. She wanted to come back to my state so we all pooled money and got her a plane ticket. 

She came back but two months later LEFT AGAIN. Again leaving her two kids, neither of whom she has custody of, with my in laws. 

My husband and I have custody of the second child, the one from this relationship. 

She’s back again, with a third kid from another guy, so far she has custody of him. But because of her moving back and forth and doing drugs and them beating each other, she insists SHE has ptsd but I don’t.  

I hate her for saying her “poor me” lifestyle was horrific. She had two loving parents, two siblings, everything handed to her, and no one beat her, she was spoiled rotten, and has never once in her 24 years of life had to pay rent or a bill since she is so spoiled. 

She chose to do drugs and continue to go back to the guy. She chose to abandon her kids, and now she’s mad at me because her son calls me mom. 

I know I shouldn’t feel this way, her ptsd is just as valid as mine, but I hate her for it.",tossawaybitch,2019-01-22 03:55:19,0,418,27.82,88.87,5.21,1.44,19,11,91.87,59.81,23.92,21.05,8.13,0.48,0,10.77,1.67,2.87,3.11,13.88,7.42,4.78,8.61,1.44,15.07,2.87,2.39,0.72,3.11,3.11,4.55,0.72,3.83,0,2.39,0.48,23.68,3.83,1.44,11.24,3.35,7.89,0.96,1.91,0.72,0.72,1.67,2.15,1.67,0.48,0.72,0.24,2.15,0.24,1.67,0.24,0,8.61,4.55,0.72,3.83,0.72,0,6.22,7.18,0,11.48,1.67,5.5,5.5,1.2,1.2,0.96,1.2,0,0.48,0.24,0.24,0,0,0,0,11.96,5.26,5.02,0,0,0,0,0,0.48,1.2,0,0

aint47,**TW** I was diagnosed with PTSD and a few other issues.,"I am 38 this coming sunday. I have PTSD, Severe social anxiety, Severe chronic depression and Suicidal tendencies among Dyslexia and a few other issues. Every day is a battle just to get out of bed and when I do then I am in fear all day and stressed worried what will trigger me or when will my next attack be.

​
I grew up in a very hostile environment. I am a guy and had a step dad who raped and molested me when I was 5 to 8, would beat me daily or tie me to trees for days on end with no food or water from age 5 to 17. Wasn't allowed to watch tv or have toys. Never went to school. was kept as a slave on our ten acres land we had. My mom never believed me or cared just as long as she had someone.

​

I was forced into incest from my uncle with his daughter, my cousin, and his other daughter and son would get him off while he forced his younger daughter and I to have sex. this happened at age 7, from 7 to 14 I would have sex with her off and on and would even engage with another cousin of mine and ended up with one of my aunts as well.

​

I have witnessed over 20 deaths, some suicides and right in front of me with a gun and unable to stop them or walked in on them after they have ended it. I grew up watching my mom trying to end her life for years. I never knew my real dad until I was 23 then he died a few months later and when I was 25 my mom died.

​

At age 19 I had met this girl and we fell in love, she got pregnant by me but on the 8th month term she went into labor and then ended up bleeding out, lost both of them when I was 20. our daughter and her. I have been homeless from age 20 to 30 and I have been obese from age 6 to now. Nothing I do will help lose weight. I have low thyroid, low testosterone, genetics on both my parents side. I had my thyroid meds upped and lost 40 lbs for the first time in my life. but then a year later gained it all back. My aunt and cousin who I rent a room from eat the same foods and same amount and they lose weight and don't do anything but sleep all day or play video games all day.

​

I have spent over 5 years in the dating scene and have yet found anyone who would give me a chance, they all just reject me because of my weight. I even tried women who were my size or a little smaller and they all just reject me. I am on SSDI and renting the room from my aunt, she is 59 in not great health and if she dies I will be forced to go back onto the streets. I will not be able to survive it again, not with having arthritis in my lower back, knees, hips, ankles and feet. Some days I can't even walk a mile, other days I can clean house then my entire body goes to hurting or gives out on me.

​

I was trying to buy a vehicle to live in and my aunt blackmailed me out of the savings money to buy a tv for her 34 year old son who has no income, doesn't want to work. lives off the both of us. And has say so of the apartment and what goes and stays. She is taking the rent money I give her and using it to make payments on a brand new car for him to have. and when I had money saved I was forced to go out and buy the first car I came across for 800 dollars because she blackmailed me out of 1500 I had saved so the car I bought turned out to be shit and had to scrap it for parts which resulted in a 100 dollars back. I been trying to save since last year when this happened but have been unable to save a dime.

​

I have tried finding rooms to rent but everyone I find won't rent to me because of either my weight or me being on SSDI. I have no rental history and my aunt refuses to be rental history for me. I have no references of any kind personal or professional. If I made a resume it would be blank because all the jobs I did were cash under the table.

I was going to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with PTSD, I have flashbacks, nightmares of things I been through in life or have seen and witnessed then wake up crying hysterically or wake up shaking and confused thinking it just rehappened or having severe panic attacks. I can go about my day doing things and all a sudden a smell, someones name, something that is triggering can send me down into a severe depressive state and bring back memories I don't want to relive and then it is just downhill from there for days on end. 

My psychiatrist quit and then I got this new one who seems to doubt my mental issues and doesn't really want to talk to me and I really didn't like talking to her when I first seen her but sadly state insurance, and they are the only ones in this dead beat town that take my insurance. so I am now not going to anyone. but it wasn't helping anyways, the meds they gave either made things worse or didn't help and my therapist I been going to and talking to nothing they suggested to me has helped, yoga, working out, walking, grounding treatments, volunteering etc none of it works or helps. I just don't know what to do at this point in my life.",allreadydead188,2019-01-22 07:18:26,2,1023,35.38,24.98,93.74,3.82,23.25,9.58,93.06,59.43,17.99,13.59,10.07,0.49,0,2.05,0.98,4.4,3.91,14.17,9.68,4.01,10.17,2.44,17.5,2.74,1.47,1.86,2.83,2.35,4.69,1.17,3.42,0.78,0.59,1.37,9.48,2.15,0.1,2.74,1.27,10.85,1.17,1.66,1.08,3.32,1.56,4.11,1.17,0.49,0.1,0.49,3.91,0.98,1.76,0.49,0.88,8.11,1.66,2.25,3.62,0.78,0.49,6.45,8.8,1.76,17.99,2.54,8.21,7.82,0.98,0.68,1.27,2.35,0,0.68,0.29,0.1,0,0,0.1,0.1,8.8,4.3,2.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.17,0,0.39
aioi77,"I almost died, and I'm still not over the shock.","I was driving to my school's financial aid office to turn in a document. I went in another direction then I usually go because I thought this route would be quicker. I came to a four way street I've never been on. I thought it was a one way street where traffic was only going one way. I was only looking to my left. However, traffic was coming in both directions.

As I proceeded through the street, A BUS WAS COMING TOWARDS ME FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION! I quickly stopped at the last minute and backed up. I was very lucky.

aiozuk,Sabbotaging my closest relationships,"It's been 4 years since I got out of my abusive relationship with my ex... Myself 25 F. 
I got engaged last month, I'm afraid I rushed into it. He loves me, but I hurt him in ways I never thought I was capable of before (before he proposed, I've worked really hard on managing my emotions since. But it still hurts knowing that I've become a damaging person after experiencing abuse in the past), mostly when I get drunk. I've cut down on drinking and I don't  get physically violent. But even both of us being sober, he often does and says things that really trigger me and I try my best to explain why it hurts me so deeply. He also tries playing the role of my psychologist which bothers me even more deeply. Lately I just get anxious for the short time I have my room all to myself and pouring myself into personal work when he is around.

But he's not the only one I push away. My family is completely dysfunctional unsupportive and majorly part of the PTSD its self by circumstance. I have no close friends to talk to because becoming close to anyone is terrifying to me. And I'm too broke and about to loose health insurance to get therapy, anti depression meds havent helped. In fact I stopped taking them. I feel like I've cornered myself and the panic attacks have been rolling in relentlessly the past week. 

I don't know what topics are touchy for others here. So I decided not to add any details of my abusive ex.

aip3j0,"ADVICE: Got over PTSD, now it's come back","Hi all, I'm looking for a bit of perspective here. I was diagnosed with PTSD from one particular kind of trauma, and over many years worked through therapy (talking, cognitive-behavioral, even EMDR), and I gradually learned the tools I needed to integrate all of my memories into my life. While I technically don't clinically qualify, I understand the idea that I will have some of my triggers and down days for the rest of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have come from an incredibly abusive work situation into another, much better position. As I digest my experiences and try to integrate into the new job, I'm finding that I'll burst into tears at random times, I'll be jumpy, dissociative, anxious, sad, and aggressive. Knowing how I used to be and what PTSD looked like for me specifically, I recognize these signs. It's coming back, and I'm trying to get in front of this.   


Does anyone have experience with this, where your PTSD comes back for either related on unrelated situations? I don't think this is just a passing flare up, I seriously think this could be a bigger relapse. I'm journaling my thoughts (a coping mechanism I found that was very productive and helpful for me), I'm doing all the other kinds of things that I know help me, and I'm making an appointment today for a few sessions with a therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd just appreciate any perspective/tips/positive vibes from people who have experienced this before. What helped you?   


TL;DR PTSD is coming back from an unrelated but abusive work situation (that I'm now out of). Therapy is planned, and I'm using all my normal coping skills. Anyone experienced this before?

aiyzc8,Tonight I had a very public meltdown at a concert...,"PTSD has ruined my life. 

Quite literally. The life that I once had is gone forever and I’ve spent 3 years now fighting a horrific battle to try and win back the me I used to be.

But tonight I think I’ve proven to myself that I’m never, ever going to be me again. 

And that breaks my fucking heart. 

My favourite artist playing live and my best friend by my side, and still I was unable to smile, to dance, to sing, to endure more than 40 mins of a 3 hour concert. I say endure... I never would have used that word in the past to refer to a concert. Ever. I was out at a gig probably once a week. I adored dancing and loud music and big crowds. But tonight instead I stood frozen in place, unable to move, to feel a thing, I hated every moment. Tears streaming down my face. Panic attack. I had to leave. Only like 6 songs in or something and boom I bolted. 

I legit adored the person I used to be, the life I used to lead. Now I’m just this broken abstract entity living in the carcass of a once awesome human. And that realisation kills me.

aj2h3g,I had a horrible nightmares,"Last night I had horrible nightmares and I’m breaking down now. I just need to talk about it with someone but I feel very alone right now.

I dreamt first that a person I hate was bit by my dog and that my dog had developed rabies (it was horrifying to see my dogs face so angry and mean), then in my dream I was talking with one of my brothers who suddenly fell down a flight of stairs. He looked up at me and I screamed “are you ok” and he responded “you never care about me!” And he started crying.


I woke up crying at that point (5am) and just laid in bed trying to calm down until my alarm went off. I cried the whole way to work and am thankful no one is in the office today so I can work and cry.

aj3ive,Memory and debriefing???,"I have problems bringing up the memories of things that took place when I am asked to tell my story. I simply cannot find them. 

Then I made a friend online and in talking to her I noticed that when she asked me a question I was able to answer with information I have, but never think of when I am just asked to tell my story. This happened frequently enough that it led me to thinking about why. 

I came up with the idea of ""debriefing"". As in questioning someone about something in a way that elicits the things not readily coming forth by self reporting. Yesterday I was reading Slaughterhouse 5 and the part where he calls Bernard V. O'Hare and he responds ""I don't remember much"" it connected what I have seen on reddit PTSD and CPTSD where people express confusion about memory or only remember highlights of a particular thing. Aside from my recently arrived at theory that the book is Vonnegut processing and explaining what he can of his own PTSD, it hit me that this ""i don't remember much"" thing might be something like my own inability to recall at will and is common to all trauma victims. I mean that the memories are there but like me they cannot on their own access them. It takes interaction with another who is more finessed at questioning a person to get the parts the owner of the memories cannot bring out on their own. 

As I write this I looked up debriefing victims and found this ""critical incidence stress debriefing"" (CISD).  I don't think it applies directly here, it seem to be intended to prevent PTSD. 

I found this Trauma - Informed Care [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207191/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207191/)  Browsing it there is no mention of debriefing decades after the fact. It all relies on/assumes at the time of occurrence reporting. 

Anyway my point and the idea of this post is to find anyone else who is surprised by how much more comes out when they are just talking to someone, than by your own volition when asked directly to tell the story. And to find out if anyone knows what I mean and can name this sort of debriefing. BTW this doesn't only apply to the abuse topic, other things are stored this way too. 

I would think Police should know about this and anyone who takes child abuse complaints etc.

aj48g7,"Back on Lamictal (Lamotrigine) because I had two bad episodes within 4 days for anxiety, ramping dosages, etc.","The best thing that ever worked was Abilify, but there was no generic when it came out and the price went from almost nothing to $400 a script once the trial and then coupons ran out. 
 
I suffer from severe anxiety and panic attacks from PTSD. It becomes a circle. I'm in a panic, I start to further panic because I'm in a panic. The more I tried to hide it the worse it became. The more I tried to write or draw not looking like chicken scratch the more it looked like chicken scratch. The more I tried not to think about something the more I thought of it. If I woke, the more I tried to have the images go away and sleep the worse I would sleep.
 
I could go into it, it was being physically tortured, but, I guess like anyone, anything can trigger it. I have to operate heavy machinery from time to time and on one day, even though I could handle the machines I was retching so hard I thought I was going to have a stroke, poured excretions from every part of my body (didn't know the body could produce that much on demand but I stay hydrated and exercise), and felt vibrations everywhere, I maintained. I was shaking so bad I couldn't light a cigarette or even use the phone. I sorta hid and bent over and wanted to puke the feelings out, even though I didn't feel the need to actually vomit.
 
I am a programmer, an artist (same thing sorta) and a musician and find solace in using my mind. I left work and went immediately home and while listening to classical I dove back into coding and doing my own private things. It was kinda strange how submersing myself in a hobby can help in times of stress of that nature.

Being on a regimen with work always helped to. Get up, get ready, do things, wind down, eat again, sleep. This time that didn't work worth a crap.
 
I can't take any SSRI's because they make my hair vibrate. Aside from abilify (which I was told made me a zombie, a shotgun approach to everything) this worked for me. 
 
Now when I tried to get off of it I ramped down. But with these two very strong episodes I felt like I was dead for 4 days. I know it was from the physical exertion, I eat well, take really good vitamins, but my body just basically quit for a few days after each episode.
 
I strongly think the reason I was ramped up in the very first place was for observation. ""See me in 2 weeks"" then upping the dose. Upping than upping then seeing where the plateau was and then back it down to where it's best. I know what worked, so I went full-on re-dosing back to where it worked before. 
 
I did this before, it has to be saturated in the body, so I'm giving it a couple of days. Sometimes meds do help.",shadowspawn,2019-01-23 12:41:19,0,531,57.08,9.39,92.32,3.78,17.7,13.18,90.02,57.63,16.38,9.79,9.6,0,0,0,0.19,6.59,7.34,13.94,7.72,6.4,7.53,1.69,18.27,4.52,3.77,1.51,1.69,2.45,5.27,1.51,3.77,1.51,0.56,0.19,1.88,0,0,0,0,12.62,2.82,2.07,1.51,2.45,1.13,3.58,3.58,1.32,0.56,1.69,4.14,1.51,2.26,0,0.56,7.72,0.38,3.01,2.64,1.69,1.13,7.91,8.85,0.94,15.07,2.07,7.72,6.21,2.07,0.75,0.19,0.56,0,0.38,0.56,0.19,0.19,0,0.19,0,15.07,5.65,5.08,0,0,0,0,0.38,0.38,1.88,1.51,0.19

I'd tried to leave twice, but he kept saying that we'd only cuddle, and idk I believed him.  I'd been with him before but I was done with it... He didn't respect my space and I didn't get anything out of it.  I was clear that I didn't want to but he kept trying and... I eventually pretended to pass out, which didn't stop him.  I'm sorry for saying this, sometimes I just have to reassure myself that it was real.  Like I said, he was a close friend and part of my immediate friend group (my roommate's boyfriend is his roommate/best friend). I've known them all since freshman and sophomore year (2-3 years).  I told my roommate what happened and how much it triggered my existing PTSD and even caused new symptoms, really scary, debilitating symptoms.  But the other night they all hung out.  Got drunk and got pizza without me.  I can't really say how much that hurts because there's really no describing the level of pain I feel. I'm not gonna tell them to stop being friends with him.  But I feel so alone.  How can I be friends with them when they hang out with my abuser? I can't press charges because his dad's a lawyer and I've seen this happen a billion times with entitled rich white boys, and I don't win.  I lose hard and I get death threats on the internet. But I also can't get out of the situation because I live with her. I really, honestly thought she was a good person. I thought she understood.  I know this is how it is with assault cases but...

aj8gd6,Idk what to do,My entire life ive had horrific fear of any sorta sexually related parts of life since i was like 4 i just recovered a memory of being held down and molested while someone put a girls hairpin in my hair so idk if i have ptsd or something cuz its not like im kinda nervous or shy but i can be completely confident and myself one second and then the next one im on the verge of tears im so scared. I once went i track club or running group for kids my age wen i was like in the 5th grade and the first day i went a girl came up to me and told me i was sexy and my reaction was to get so angry i wanted to literally kill her my face started twitching and i was almost about to cry i wanted to tell her to fuck off but i jus sorta looked away i dont think she noticed cuz she jus ran away after saying it. i pretty much am able to keep my composure in situtations like this other than obviously seem uncomfortable or scared asf. But situtations like this keep happening in my life im 22 ive never had sex never done anything sexual and my fear of it ruins my ability to make friends away from that because im just scared theyll talk about it with me. It ruined my chance to play basketball in my life people told me i could have easily played pro overseas or something if i tried. This fear has completely ruined my life thus far. Now after dropping out of college after 1 week i work at kroger and 2 girls who work there have already tried hookin up with me and i literally just dont have the ability to do that kinda stuff. So idk what to tell these people or what to do i have no kinda sexuality its not even like im gay or something i just wanna torture someone sexually this life is hell please help i really dont know what to do.,aquilles22,2019-01-23 19:55:01,2,356,16.06,4.88,94.01,1,39.56,11.52,93.82,62.08,23.03,15.73,14.33,0,0,1.12,0.28,7.3,2.25,14.61,10.39,6.46,8.71,3.09,18.54,3.93,2.81,1.4,2.53,1.12,7.58,1.97,5.62,2.53,1.4,1.4,7.02,0,0.28,1.97,0,16.29,1.69,1.97,1.69,7.02,1.97,5.34,0.56,0.28,0.28,0,4.49,0.28,1.97,2.25,0,5.34,1.12,2.81,1.69,0.56,0,6.74,10.96,0.84,11.8,1.97,4.78,5.06,1.12,1.4,0,0,0.28,0.28,3.93,0.84,3.09,0,0,0.84,2.25,2.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

aj9fy2,Survivor's Guilt,"Hello everyone,

First time posting. Does anyone else struggle with survivor's guilt? My trauma was just over a decade ago and I still feel that guilt in my stomach everyday. Only recently have I started to seek professional help and open up to a therapist about it. He's a wicked nice guy who specializes in our type of disorder and he said survivor's guilt is common with ptsd sufferers who experienced my type of...trauma, particularly when it takes place in an....academic environment. I'm avoiding specifics as to prevent triggers for anyone reading (aka I'd have to mark this post NSFW, which I have no idea how to do). Part of it involved my breaking routine, where if it had been followed, I wouldn't be alive to post this. My mind constantly questions why I managed to avoid death and not someone else who maybe would have done something amazing with their life like cured cancer? My trauma left me confused about what my purpose is on this planet and what I'm supposed to be doing. Self-medicating with drugs dulled the pain from my experience, but exponentially increased the guilt as I was definitely not being a productive member of society while under the influence. Even though I've been clean for months, my existential crisis is still ongoing. Basically, I'm wondering if this guilt is as common as my therapist claims and if so, how do people cope? Most specifically, HOW do you find your purpose for existence when you're lost and broken?",ISTJ_PHD,2019-01-23 21:58:32,1,257,17.12,37.77,67.57,1,18.36,21.01,91.83,58.75,19.46,11.28,8.56,0.39,1.17,0.78,0.39,8.17,3.11,13.23,12.06,8.56,8.95,1.56,17.12,5.84,2.72,5.06,0.39,0.78,7.78,1.17,6.61,3.89,0.39,0.78,8.95,0,0.39,0,1.17,15.18,1.95,3.5,1.95,5.06,2.33,3.5,1.95,0,0.39,0.78,3.5,0.39,3.11,0,0,8.56,1.56,2.72,2.72,0.39,1.56,5.45,9.34,0,12.45,0.78,4.67,5.45,1.95,0,0,0,0,0.78,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,0,17.12,6.23,3.89,0,0,1.56,0,0.39,0,4.28,0.78,0

ajbpqq,I think I may be having PTSD,"I’m the youngest in my family. My brother is a few years older and we grew up in a one parent household. When our mom was at work he would watch me. I remember some good times like when he took me fishing or hiking. They don’t outweigh the bad. Thinking back I never told anyone except a therapist how awful my brother was to me. He would do things that weren’t as severe such as make food that was horribly spicy and make me try it as a “joke.” He pushed me down the stairs as a “joke.” 
He stuck nasty bugs in my shoe, etc. I guess “normal” things a brother would do? 

What really sticks in my mind is when he would pin me down and suffocate me with a pillow. I remember screaming and he would do it until I stopped. I remember him saying he wouldn’t let me go until I stopped screaming. I remember the feeling of being crushed and not being able to breathe. I honestly cannot remember how often this happened to me when I was younger. Another thing he would do to me was pin me down and grab a knife and pretend he was going to stab me and then at the last second turn the knife. 

All of this happened at least 20-25 years ago. The reason I think I’m having PTSD is because if I feel at any time that “crushing sensation” I feel major anxiety and feel like I need space. It happened to me yesterday when I was at the dentist and I had to sit up and just take a breather. The same happens with me if my husband and I are being intimate and he is on top and everything is fine then all of a sudden we have to stop because I’m feeling that crushing sensation. 

I’m fully estranged from my family for multiple reasons but wanted to share my story. I see a therapist for this and many reasons but lately I feel like this is coming up more and more. I do feel like it’s PTSD and a mixture of anxiety and depression.

ajbz2p,Hurricane PTSD,"So after two years of no therapy and suffering whenever any small storm hit or wind would pass by, I’m growing more and more certain that I developed PTSD. 
I live in Florida and have lived through many hurricanes as a kid. I don’t remember much, but I remember crying and feeling terrified anytime a small storm would hit long after the hurricane was gone, especially at night. 
After Hurricane Irma hit in 2017, I began feeling terrified of the sun going down and going to sleep at night, since that’s when the storm hit Miami. It’s only intensified whenever we would get rain or wind. Even power outages trigger memories. 
I can’t talk about it to anyone here because they laugh it off and go, “You’re so weak, when I went through Hurricane Whatever, we partied and drank, etc.”
Well that’s good and all except I have an abusive/lazy dad who obviously didn’t install the shutters the right way. Actually, he almost didn’t install them at all, believing there was no hurricane and it would just be a regular day. 
When the transformers exploded and the power went out, the entire storm was spent terrified the shutters would fly off with every gust. 
Hurricane season doesn’t start for us until summer, but I really want to evacuate or seek help when the next major hurricane hits. Obviously, leaving isn’t going to happen because my dad doesn’t want to spend money, and he doesn’t care if the storm affects anyone else, as long as he’s fine. I heard him talking about selling our shutters before the next major hurricane to make money. 
I can’t afford to leave on my own. 
Has anyone else gone/going through this? I’m looking for every possible way to cope during the next storm, but I couldn’t even fall asleep last night with all the wind hitting the walls outside. Therapy also most likely isn’t an option. It’s for “crazy people” according to my family and I’m already enough of a disappointment as it is. 
If anyone has overcome ptsd on their own or learned how to cope with it, any suggestions would be much appreciated.

aji566,Is anyone else intimidated/fearful by very dominant/masculine/alpha men?!,"Is anyone else intimidated/fearful by very dominant/masculine/alpha men?!

When I’m around masculine men who are dominate, very
Logical and not emotional, barely smiling, very serious, seem to anger easily, super assertive... I get so intimidated, fearful, and feel helpless around them. I feel less in control of situations around these types of men and maybe it’s because they often like to call all the shots and control others. And I don’t like that. Plus also I am not used to these types of men as the men in my family (brother and dad) are pretty soft, emotional, passive and let me get my way most of the time. 

I wonder if it’s related to my past trauma for me to be fearful of these types of men because their nature it makes me feel less in control. And feeling in control has been a coping mechanism for me to feel safe especially from abusers. Also I think I noticed that in order to protect me from my abusers in my family, I had to become this masculine and powerful version of myself. So maybe I can intimidated by these types of me because I’m like, “whoa, you men are the real thing. You were what i became (to a certain extent) in order to protect myself.”

I feel safer around softer men and calmer and like I can relate to them more (probably because we are both feelers and emotional) and I’m used to this type of man. On the other hand, I also notice I feel attracted to dominant men especially sexually and also how they are often assertive, ambitious, and they can protect and stick up for me instead of me always sticking up for myself. But I also feel like I don’t know how to have a relationship with these types of men because I’ve never been friends with people like that. And I don’t know how to interact with them. Sometimes I’ll act really serious around them because I think that’s what they want? It’s like I feel like they are so different from me. Then I feel anxiety around them like I have to please them and not make them mad. Also, since these dominant men are so overpowering, it scares me because I know if they are toxic individual, they could use their dominating power to really hurt me. Which is what happened when I was sexually harassed 2 years ago. 

But I also have this fascination and attraction towards them. Perhaps it’s that natural inclination of people wanting polarity in a relationship—someone more masculine and the other feminine. I think I’m an ENFP so I would say men who are like ENTJ intimidate me.

I’m confused about whether these types are men for me as my body is telling me conflicting things.

ajjpgh,Does anyone have advise when it comes to cleaning with PTSD? It makes everything look unfamiliar and causes me to panic.,"(Hear me out I know it's weird and stupid and sounds like a cop-out)

Every time I tidy my brain quickly goes into panic mode or having full on panic attacks because even though its the same place with other of the same surroundings its unfamiliar and different from how it should be. The only way I can get around this is by doing so super slowly two or three things at a time before waiting until the things not being there is the new familiar or by just cleaning everything like literally everything; moving furniture to clean under, it wiping down the walls, organizing, just making everything look as much like an IKEA catalog as actually used areas can actually look and dealing with the subsequent downfall of my metal heath. I don't have the time take my time with this (anniversaries are coming and I'm always out of commission for two or three months with them and I want it to be livabley clean before then because it's not going to be after {last year I had dry vomit on my bed for two weeks before I had the energy to clean it and I still slept in it}) and I'm not sure if a big stresser right between the one month of calm (after the winter holidays and before the anniversaries) is smart.

I'd ask my therapist but I don't want her to be upset with me for letting it go this far and I'm worried she'll judge me because I can't even pick up my dirty clothes without feeling unsafe because it all looks different or taking the stack of books I was going to read but didn't from my desk to my bookshelf without putting them right back because I can't calm down with them not being there anymore because it's become the new normal.

ajjwp0,I'd like to vent. Please understand.,"My stepdad was an English teacher at the school I went to.

My science teacher had cancer, and she died. There were different memorials, for different people. I got to go to the staff and faculty memorial, because wives and daughters did. My stepdad...

You don't forget a memorial like that.

Some other students were there. I heard later that they had that reaction people do. Surprised, admiring, saying ""You can sing!""

He can sing.

Those are the words for it, but I don't think they're enough. What my stepdad can do is take his voice, extend it out to where you were in the audience, grab you by the heart, and make your heart sing along with him.

It was impressive, inspiring, beautiful.

I threw out my dresses because I thought that would make him touch me less. Watched my hair fall out from stress. Hated my body because it was something he wanted.

I got reminded recently that people think that evil people are evil.

Like that's all they are.

Like beauty and evil never coexist in the same person. Like the moment I say ""molester"" he becomes incapable of being friendly, and generous, and kind. Like the moment I say ""friendly, and generous, and kind"" he becomes incapable of being a molester.

Like I'm not allowed to remember the person who gave me remembrance, strength, and hope, because he's also the person who gave me post-traumatic stress disorder.

I hate him, okay?

What he did to me. What his job as a high school teacher gave him the opportunity to do to others. The creeping realization that maybe the daughter from his first marriage has a good reason for never speaking to him.

I hate him.

But it takes something away from me, and something away from that hate, to not acknowledge the other things he was.

It takes something away from the betrayal.

I wasn't molested by someone twirled his moustache and laughed. I was molested by someone who taught, who inspired, who sincerely gave himself to people.

I have to live with that.

I have to reconcile that evil and that good in the same person.

I don't have the option of thinking that a good person doesn't molest, like my mother screamed at me. I don't have the option of thinking a molester does no good, like my best friend screamed at me. I don't get to separate them. 

I don't get to have that.

But about a week ago I had a nightmare and suddenly everything is back. Not as strong as before, but it’s back. I know that progress isn’t linear, and I know I’ve made it far.

ajn08b,Meds and PTSD,"I’m struggling with figuring out meds and what’s the right combination for me after being diagnosed. I’m currently being treated for my PTSD by a trauma therapist specializing in EMDR and after today, I quite honestly love her.

My psychiatrist isn’t in agreement with my therapists as far as my diagnosis which is insane to me considering their all under my insurance plan? My understanding was that they should at least share clinical notes between them but I could easily be wrong. My psychiatrist keeps wanting to put me on antidepressants which I’ve reluctantly agreed to because I feel like I have to listen to what they say but they seem to add fuel to the fire. I started Prozac today and it’s been absolute torture. Crazy high anxiety, sweating, cold sweats, hot flashes, tingling sensations. What is going on? What am I doing wrong? How is it my therapist was on the phone with me for an hour today and I couldn’t get a response from my psychiatrist all day? I feel like I’m losing my mind but in the back of my head... I blame the meds. Is this correct or delusion? My therapist offered her contact information to my psychiatrist and I can’t stop thinking about that moment. I have no idea what she’s gonna say but is it too much to hope she’s actually on my side? I’m entering dangerous grounds by liking her so much cause it means if she were to terminate me I would be absolutely crushed. 

I’m hoping others here will share their experiences in the hopes it can help guide me to a real solution because I cannot keep living like this. Thank you.

ajna3m,"I got out! But it's almost harder now. It's like I was holding my breath that whole time, and now that I can finally exhale, I'm left gasping. There's just so much I dissociated from, I cannot really handle it","Positive, no further trauma, but negative, all the abuse I absorbed and dissociated from is now all burning me alive all at once. I purposely have poor memory of those years and purposely don't seek to recall any events, but flashes of random things come to me and they are so absolutely horrifying, I am having difficulty functioning. I don't actively think about them, or anything really - I feel brain dead and stupid these days - yet I also find myself randomly crying in the grocery store for no specific reason and getting lost driving to work. I know it's a ptsd thing but I don't know what to do? How to get this out of me? I tried therapy the first few months (so end of last year) but I almost felt like talking about it a bunch made it harder for me to move forward, and I disliked giving him any more of my time and mental energy and life (trauma therapy is exhausting) so this year I decided I would focus on my own self, my own present and future, instead of him and the past (with the promise to myself I will return to working through anything after I rebuilt my own foundation).

But I feel like I am in unfamiliar, dark waters, and just don't see any recovery nor progress, and am too exhausted and brain dead to research all the ways to help myself stop being brain dead, and like I said, all that time of not processing things is now flooding me, mostly subconsciously if not unconsciously.

I don't know what to do. Therapy (talking about it) almost worsened it, psychiatrist attempt has messed up my brain chemistry, the one thing I would like to really do (exercise / movement - reconnect with my body) I always intend to do but I'm so brain dead next thing I know 5 hours have passed and I'm not really sure what I've been doing since I've come home from work but now I need to force myself to fall asleep so I can be ""productive"" at work, which lately means working 10 hours a day, 140% focused, yet incapable of producing nor accomplishing anything. Again, I have no idea how the time really passes.

I meant to just post the title, had typed up something then deleted it, then typed something else and now here we are. I am moving soon to a place more in nature and in an environment that will not allow me to be so much a recluse, which I am stressed about but is a challenge I am purposely bringing onto myself because I think that it's a good idea right now.

I thought about going to some support group but again I don't want to continue focusing on the past and giving him any more of me, indulging it. I want to move forward. But can't figure out how.

\[originally I wrote this in r/abusive relationships\] Hmm I may crosspost this to [r/ptsd](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd). I was always one for looking up the empirical studies and biohacking my genetics. That is what I need to do to help me now, but I'm so low/off/dead/foggy/in a foreign land that it is too much for me. Would really like some empirical guidance + supplement stack + detox + etc advice.

Now that I think of it I may also have a concussion. Just remembered some things from when I saw him last. I don't really know exactly for sure though but actually I just remembered I think I hit my head on the concrete ground really hard.

ajqq9t,Struggling with PTSD questions,"For those with PTSD (and I know this will look different for everyone):   
\-What do you expect/need from someone you're in a relationship with, your family, friends, etc?  
\- What do you expect from yourself? If you find yourself in a conversation about how your behavior is influencing someone else, even if they understand how it's PTSD related, do you feel angry and defiant and like you're not understood? Or is there room alongside the trauma for an understanding of how the people around you are affected, even if they are supportive and understanding?   


I'm currently struggling with what someone might be struggling with because PTSD makes it difficult and scary and triggering and what is just learned selfish behavior and an inability to be accountable. (Please accept my apologies if this sounds harsh, negative, or judgemental, as that is not my intention at all -  I am very new to navigating the complications of living with someone with PTSD and I understand progress can be slow, but I am currently trying to learn as much as I can about this complex and diverse mental health condition so that I can learn, adapt, and communicate better.

ajxoaf,Shame and guilt of my abuse: Is it my fault? Am I to blame? Am I defective as a human being?,"Tldr: ok, I know this post is way too long. But anyone who had been abused as a child, please please read this, it possibly could be a life saver for me. And for anyone who went through simmilar edperiences

I am 35 years old now.
I have being digging in and ignoring my whole childhood abuse. Because I thought if someone found out, that someone would feel I am worthless as a human being.

I remember since kindergarten I was different. Some adults liked me, some did not. I was oversensitive, while highly curious. But I never got along with other children in kindergarten. I waa an outcast, playing with toys alone.

When I went to first grade, i thought great, nobody knows me here. I can start it all all over again. But something happened. I didnt get along with other children...again. And for the first time I was starting to be abused. Just name calling like idiot, moron, imbecile, kick on the shoulder, maybe spitting. 

And I changes classes...again. Again, I was a black sheep. By that time it was very visible I was poor. And also, thinking back, im thinking...as my lack of understanding  social interaction and sarcasm, i maybe had aspergers. I dont think that anymore, but I was definitely oversensitive about everything.

Then in one time in my third grade everytime i had a conflict i bited someone. And the main teacher (our education has one teacher for four grades) hated my guts. Now I was the ashole who bighted half a class. Couple of times, because of some nonchalant reason like when i teared up a piece of paper, teacher slapped me.

I think i told my parents, but my father was depressive, nonconfrontational kind od guy. Through next four years of schooling it only got worse. I got beat up and mocked up regulary. Once, this person hit me with a leg on my arm and my finger got sprained. And there was anothwr guy who hit my head on side of a table that i got stiches.

In that time, i got no friends. None. I was being alone, watching tv. It was very sad childhood.

I started to got bad grades. And in this country, with a 14 yo, you can choose a high school you want based on the grades.

I got in a technical printery school.
First year was not so bad. Then suddenly, four guys, who from what i heard were from a local gangs and after joined in prison made me their target, slave, a b*tch in colocvial use.
Those guys were real psychopats.
I was abused physicaly, mentaly and sexualy. Funny thing is, everyone in classroom knew that, boys and girls, but everyone disnt wanted to do anything.
I didnt also do anything. Thinking now, i didnt want to say it to my parents, they were already dysfunctional, my teachers wouldnt believe me and even if they did there was nothing they can do. Also, i thought i deserve that. That i am worthless and aomething is wrong with me.

And the school with my 19 year old finally stopped. Somehow i got new friends, i went into the music, started to play dnd, went out and drink. Years between 19 and 25 were good time, i met some good people, even had few relationship. I think it was because young people around 20 have thia surge of energy which last couple of years.

Then, depresion hit me big time. You all know symptoms, suicide thoughts, unable to cope with reality, couldnt sleep etc.

And then by some sheer luck i met a normal guy who had some rough times, his both parents died. We talked about depression and he suggested me a paychiatrist.

At age 27 for the first time i went to psychiatrist, and at that time i thought i had bipolar, so she gave me seroquel. It helped me A LOT. i enrolled college and finished first year. But, with seroquel i slept for 13 hours a day. This was not good.

I already made this story way too long.
But i went on my usual cicle od feeling that everyone hates me, of how i am not worthy, and such feeling of pain every time there is something on tv from that time (like friends for example)

Now i am 35. I have finally being diagnosed with right stuff. Borderline personality disorder, ptsd, anxiety, depression.

And i never tqlked this to anyone, because of feeling shame. Those kids bullied me, because there is something inherently wrong with me. I am just a dog turd in human suit. And this shame and guilt is enormous.

I never spoke this to ANYONE. I wanted to peope to think i am normal guy as anyone else.

Then, yesterday, I went to my psychiatrist, and told her everthing. Most of stuff i told you here. I never cried in front of her, but suddenly there was a rainfall from my eyes, and for the first time i didnt care what she would think of me.

I felt a bit better about telling this to someone, with this trapped emotions inside me.

So, I am teling this to you to. I am sorry for a long story. I feel this shame od being me, because in my childhood no matter how often i switched classes, kids rejected me.

So, title of this post still stands as a question.",Thund77,2019-01-25 20:23:50,3,937,26.67,25.74,93.06,3.03,11.71,16.65,91.46,56.78,20.92,13.45,11.63,0.21,0.53,0.64,0.43,7.47,3.63,11.74,8.43,6.08,7.47,2.13,17.5,3.42,1.49,1.39,2.45,2.13,6.19,1.81,4.27,0.75,1.28,1.17,9.18,0.43,1.07,0.53,1.07,13.13,3.42,1.6,1.28,3.42,1.6,2.45,1.81,0.43,0.43,0.96,1.81,1.07,0.53,0.11,0.11,8,1.6,0.96,3.09,1.71,0.85,8.96,6.19,0.53,14.3,0.85,4.91,8.43,2.56,0.85,0,0.21,0,0.53,0.64,0.21,0.32,0.11,0,0,17.61,9.18,7.36,0.21,0,0.32,0,0,0,0,0.43,0.11

ajyj8x,"Something I wrote...Maybe wrong sub for this but after suffering awful ptsd symptoms all day, i came out of a panic attack/depersonalization/derealization/depressive episode and wrote this. Just sort of came out. Thought I'd share it here.","I want to be able to speak with clarity about these things that haunt me. I want to recount the horrors with both sufferance and indifference. 
But how can I? 
When any concept of time feels detached from my reality. When my existence separates from everyone else’s. When everything slows; looping eternities between the ticks and tocks of the clock. 
Screaming in my head. An endless cacophony of alarm bells. 
When my tongue forgets the subtle formation of vowels and consonants. 
What is a vowel? What is a consonant? 
Have you ever repeated a word so many times that it starts to break down? Disintegrate, 
like a dandelion into the thick, heavy blanket of air? 
When my mind won’t think in words. Ears refuse to hear. When my hands are not my own. 
This body is alien, 
some kind of organic space suit I’ve somehow been trapped in. 
A stranger stares back from the mirror.
Terror. 
When I am not me, and you are not here and nothing is real. 
You can’t trick me. I know this isn’t happening. 
If you cannot trust your mind, you cannot be human. 
(Cannot be human.)
You are nothing. I am nothing. Or am I? Are we? 
Did you dream me up or I, you? Have you walked the labyrinth? How is it that shared suffering somehow soothes the soul?
What a cruel joke. 
How is anyone supposed to make sense of this nightmare where parallel realities come crashing down on this tiny, haggard, fragile thing that is called a self; already shattered, cracking from the inside out. The pressure is far too great. How could they not have known? 
What kind of ridiculous endeavor is this? An excruciating exercise in futility, masquerading as some sort of grand opportunity for redemption. 
Lies. And yet, hilarity. My head keeps pounding pounding pounding.
Maybe Sartre was right. Am I the stranger? Nausea. To that I surely can relate. 
Help. It never stops. Do I even want it to? 
Oh, please, please, please. Tell me, is this hell? All I know to exist anymore - the panic, the vomit, cold, clammy hands. But haven’t you heard? God loves his children. 
They say God loves his children. 
Oh, I want to believe. How I wish I could be someone’s child. I’d do everything right. I’d never misbehave. 
But I know it’s a lie. 
I’m rotten inside. They could smell the decay from miles away; the putrid, festering soul stuck inside of me. I would have thrown me away too. If I could reach in and tear this cancer out, I would. Please know that I have tried. But the core always remains; impenetrable.
Coils of cold, black, merciless death keep snaking their way through every vessel, every limb, every vacant chamber of this wasted mind, further and further until I am suffocating (suffocating)
until they crowd me out. 
Then what is left? How can I be stuck in this awful in-between world? In between what and what you might wonder? I often do too. 
If only the answer were within our grasp.
I am more dead than alive anymore. It wasn’t always this way. All I ever meant to be was what you wanted. What you needed. What you tried to get out of me. 
I’d give you everything; but there’s nothing left. (Nothing left)
Please forgive me. 
I wish this wasn’t me. 
Can we pretend this isn’t me, even if just for a breath?

ak456b,"Keep Vomiting and getting sick, doctors are saying it’s psychosomatic","December and January have been really rough on me. This is my 2nd time with the flu and even when I’m feeling ok, I keep vomiting multiple times a day. 

Backstory: 
I’ve had the vomiting since college. My parents just gave me home remedies like honey and baking soda. I lived with them and couldn’t get out of their household till I got a job out of state. 

I got hospitalized for 30+ days for ptsd and was prescribed Zoloft. My vomiting went away while I was hospitalized. I got better, got a new job I love, a supportive SO. 

A year later, my vomiting and GI got worse (like loose stools worse) and I went to the gastroenterologist, got scoped, and was told there was nothing medically wrong with me. 

My psychiatrist prescribed me buspirone and my vomiting briefly subsided for a few months. I told him I believe Zoloft is giving my diarrhea and he believes it’s still psychosomatic and from anxiety. 

Yesterday I was told by him we’ve reached a block with medication. Since I got serotonin syndrome when on abilify at a low dose and more buspirone makes me tired. 

I don’t know what to do and I feel stuck. I also feel guilty for being sick again and my SOs parents are in town and all I can think about is if they’re like my parents. 

TL;DR: my psychiatrist told me we’ve hit a wall in meds. I’m still vomiting multiple times a day and I don’t know what to do.",o3dipusr3x,2019-01-26 11:32:36,3,267,31.46,22.7,91.44,1,14.83,17.98,91.01,53.93,17.98,16.1,13.48,0.75,0,1.12,0.75,1.87,4.87,11.24,10.49,4.87,8.99,1.5,22.1,5.62,3,1.5,0.37,1.87,7.49,1.87,5.62,0.75,0,0.37,7.49,1.12,0.37,0,1.12,5.99,3,1.12,0.75,0.37,0.75,0.75,2.62,0,0.37,1.87,10.49,0,9.36,0,0.75,8.24,2.25,0.37,1.12,3.75,1.12,9.74,11.24,0,13.86,1.12,4.49,8.61,1.5,0,1.12,0,0,0,0.37,0,0,0.37,0,0,15.36,6.37,2.62,0.75,0.37,0,0,0,0,4.12,0.75,0.37

They don’t understand that I can close my eyes and describe each and every incident clear as day of her abuse. They claim I make myself sick and that’s why I have epilepsy. No, I have epilepsy because of being abused impacted my health so much, adverse childhood experiences effect health. 

I never asked to be abused. And, they just brush me off as crazy.

I am not.

I literally only had one therapy session and the receptionist girl messed up and put my appointment even later than when it was supposed to be. That’s not my fault. 

And,  neither is my PSTD. It’s my mom’s fault for using me as a punching bag.

ak6zun,"Lets talk about psychotherapeutists, what they can do for us, what is their limit and power, and the road of self healing","So ok, I am living in this new world view where people tell me, youre lucky, PTSD and be completely cured. Borderline can be completely cured, as both are mostly from some root of the childhood abuse.

Let me share some context here.
We all live in different countries around the world. And I think that USA is the country where people going to therapeutists have at least stigma. This is me judging from media, tv and stuff. I feel like stigma in USA is maybe finally less and less.

I am thinking about going to psychotherapy. This will not be good psychotherapy, in my country it is paid by the state, but lists are long, and quality is very, very poor. The waiting rooms are too crowded, and sometimes you wait for appointments for months. I am from Croatia btw. But first, let me ask you some questions for those who went to the psychotherapeutist:

1. How much did it help you, and did the therapeutist came to the root of this diagnosis of PTSD?
I will not talk about my diagnosis and I hope so niether you, because just by talking about it it gives me so much pain. I think writing this right now is a bit easy for me, because I am using some really usefull medications.
Two things about my causes: it happened what it happened. I feel shame and guilt. So, people tell me it is not my fault. It is not so easy to accept that as a fact. My abuse lasted for more than a decade. When someone say to me ""It is not your fault"", I dont believe that person. I feel like the person really must know me, really really know me for 20 years before I opened myself and when he say that, there is possibility I could believe him or her. But therapeutists will make you feel good because of money, or it is their job. What could they do to disarm this thought?

2. My primary thought about feeling really healed, is looking back at my past without any ounce of pain. With completely guiltless, free heart and soul I can talk about it as I talk about it what is my favorite football game or something like that. But how can you talk about it? For some time I went to Jung psychotherapeutist, realy nice guy, at the moment I mentioned the trauma, 10 years of trauma to be exact, and thinking about it makes me feel so much pain. Remembering places makes me feel pain, even tv shows and movies and commercials from that period of time makes my heart really like under the press holder or how do you call it. Every time I went from my psychotherapeutist, it made me feel pain.
Question here is how do you talk about it without feeling pain?

3. What schools of psychotherapy do you use? I heard cognitive behavioral therapy is the best for PTSD. But it is really the most expensive. I cannot really afford it. Therapeutists I will go to soon will be old school freudian types. But anyhow I want to hear your comments on therapeutist schools, gestalt for example or any other, and how much it helped you.

4. How long do you go? Months, years, decades? And how many therapeutists did you changed and why?

5. And finally. progress. Can you tell me a progress from 1 to 10 how was on beginning, and the same 1 to 10 how is it now?

&gt;I hope this post will help others too, not only me. I feel like Im going to this subreddit only when I feel pain, and I want to see and hear progress. They say it is curable, so let them make some examples. Or some of your success stories, that would be great. I am also sorry if some simmilar post has already been, and please link me to it

I wish you a road to fast recovering,

I am able to answer questions in message exchanges that I would never have thought I had the information to be able to answer. I can't even think of those questions.

ak7pi9,Do I have ptsd,"I used to be school bus driver as I was trying to join military. I had a minor bottom out accident as bottom of bus got hit. The next day I had 3 trips including late night. I couldn't really sleep well because I was thinking about the other consequences and I was thinking about ways of fixing damage.

For whatever reason, maybe too inexperienced or head boss didn't like people calling sick, I decided to tough out the day. It was like a 20 hiur day. The next two were fine but the third trip I made the mistake of getting the bus stuck in ditch after backing into grass with like 30 people on board. It had to get towed out. Later the passengers didn't want me driving them back at night like halfway through and they knew about my lack of sleep. I later got a strongly worded reprimand letter about it. It claimed that i endanered a lot of lives and that I was close to being fired. This affects my security clearance statud.

Sometimes it flairs up and I can't sleep or sometimes I'll cry. It was the most scary and stressful day of my life. I feel so guilty about what I did and the people I put at risk.

 In the early months of this year I got kind of psychotic due to my depression. I was obsessed with being famous and pushing my musical carrier. And there was this girl. I got to know her from playing video games online. That was when my first deep depression hit me. I had never experienced anything nearly as low as that. She was the only one I was couraged to tell about that, because she is living like 6 hours of driving away from me, so if she judged me, or made fun of me, she couldn't spread that information into my peer group, because I was the only one around me, who knew her. Typical BPD behavior, I wasn't trusting my friends that I've known for years. 

So yeah, I got incredibly strong feelings for this girl and would do anything for her, even giving my own life. She meant so much to me, even thought we would only see a few times a year. Sadly she never felt the same for me, but that was kinda okay. After she entered my life, I slowly got the feeling of trusting other people. I got to know her 2015 after christmas. This girl sticked in my head. I was shy and it was pretty hard for me to talk to her and stuff, but she seemed to like me anyway. 

But 2018 changed everything. As I said, I got psychotic. I used a lot of weed, tons of alcohol and had done acid once and would do it multiple times throughout the year. I got the feeling, she was hindering me from archieving my goals and was something I needed to cut her out of my life. So in march, she came to visit me and my friends, who she knew relatively well by now. I was different at that time. Well I behaved weirdly and did some stuff that was highly inappropriate. And after she left us some days later, I really knew how badly I have fucked this up.

She meant so much to me and I fucked this up so bad. And loving someone with someone with BPD is not simple love, it's complete obsession and admiration of this one person. 

The next few months I tried to fix this between us. She was pissed and disappointed and stuff. We were still in touch, as we were texting almost daily for years. But I took the trust from this friendship. I could very easily tell, that she still liked me, but there was a huge rift between us now. It wasn't close to be the same as it was before. And I wasn't okay with that, I wanted my old friend back. In the same way, she was before this few days, she was staying here.

I got so severly scared of losing her (BPD makes this fear so fucking intense) throughout this whole year, as she was everything to me. 

Today, she is one of the triggers of my PTSD, maybe the strongest. This year I've also tried coke for the first time and fucked up my cardiovascular system. I had some nights waking up and being afraid of dying. 

Next up I was planning on killing myself once, but didn't pursue that plan. I was depressed almost for the whole year. Also I've came to the conclusion, I might have ADHD, as I was comparing the DSM-V symptoms with myself. Also my brother has long been diagnosed with ADHD. In summer I had my first manic episode and after that, I knew my brain far from being intact. I was looking into mental illnesses and found a lot which described my symptoms. At that time, ADHD and Bipolar. In juli I found out about BPD and OCD. And through all this time until end of summer I've done a lot of LSD and got really psychotic. It was fueling my mania and I was convinced to be the next Kurt Cobain. I was sure I would kill myself for months and had do live this drug life. In end of july I slowly became addicted to Kratom. After school started again in August, I would use it in school time to kill my anxiety and fears. I thought, I was soon quitting school and pursueing my musical carrier. After a LOT of stress with teachers, and with my parents and the girl I fucked up with, I felt so incredibly hopeless and without cover. Kratom, at that time. was the only thing keeping me guarded from this cruel world and existence. I was scared of my parents, who put a lot pressure on me and everything was just too much. In october I started to have flashbacks and severe anxiety when thinking about the girl, I fucked up with.   

End of october I quit school, where I wasn't present most of the time anyway. 06th November I quit my deep addiction to Kratom cold-turkey, which I wanted to hide from my parents. That shit in addition to my PTSD-symptoms caused extremely fast Bipolar cycling. In December I met my psychiatrist and told her about my assumption about ADHD, BPD, Bipolar Disorder and OCD and was able to explained her my concerns. That helped me a lot. In December, my PTSD symptoms were almost gone as I was avoiding the major triggers as much as possible.

But one day Januar 2019 they completely surprised me and finally came back. 

Pretty long post so far. My concern was that there are people, who experienced horrible things to lead to their diagnosis, but my year felt like hell,  but in comparison to others, the stuff I've experienced sound like some first world problems. And this is really bothering me and makes me question my diagnosis. 

If you are willing to speak about it, I would hear some of your stories, that lead to your diagnosis.

It just feels wrong that this kind of stuff made me get this illness. It feels like I'm just too weak, so these minor problems made me get the way I am now after experiencing all of that. To be fair, my symptoms aren't as severe in comparison to some people, who suffer every single day from this illness. I get some days of sometimes. But when it hits, it HITS.

ak8mrc,DAE wish they could just enjoy sex again?,"I can’t even come to terms with my own sexuality let alone date. Being raped as a kid, coupled with my catholic upbringing, made me homophobic and insecure in my masculinity. I would have an immediate flashback if I tried to have sex with a guy there’s just no way it would work. I’ve heard that, contrary to my own experience, it’s not painful. people actually enjoy it. There’s a whole facet of my life taken from me, there’s even a whole community there for me which, when I’m done making “no homo” jokes, would support me.

akat9q,"Nightmares and flashback support - TW sexual assault, hospitalization","Hello! It’s now 4 am, and I’m awake AGAIN because I heard my name being called in my sleep and someone knocking at the door but when I got up to check (nervously, might I add), no one was there and now wide awake and scared again. Just before this, I was having a nightmare about people I knew hunting me for sport and a lot of people had paid to come shoot at me. Before that, I had a nightmare about my service dog dying, and lately I’m depending on her more than anything. 

My original diagnosis of PTSD was due to a sexual assault that happened shortly after my parents divorced, and now recently because of some medication I was prescribed, I had a psychotic break and was sent to the ER twice and then a psychiatric hospital, and not five days later I was I sent to jail because of something I did (that I don’t remember) while I was hallucinating during my psychosis. 

I’m starting to have nightmares of the police coming to my apartment and taking me away, things making me not safe at home, etc. especially when my roommate is gone for work and it feels all too much like the start of some secondary PTSD. 

I’m here asking if y’all have tips on dealing with PTSD related nightmares and flashbacks, I’ve got my dog sitting with me watching Netflix because I can’t sleep - any little noise makes me jump. Love and kindness to you all!

akb374,Still trying to find where I belong,"Over the last 3 years, I tried taking advantage of group therapy through the VA. I always felt like I didn't belong because my PTSD wasn't military related. I do go to therapy and try to remember to take my meds daily, but that day is always with me. From the time I wake up to when I finally get to sleep, the day the changed my life is always in the back of my mind. Countless times I've gone through that day and second guess everything that I did. 

My wife does what she can to help me, mostly holding me and trying to make me smile, but there are days that I walk around fighting like hell not to break down. 

It's been a long battle and I hope that one day I can win this war.

akb8tp,I am so tired of tiptoeing around land mines in my life (PHYSICAL ASSAULT TW),"BACKGROUND: my PTSD is centered on a a series of physical assaults I suffered through during my teenage developmental years (about a decade ago). They involved beatings and my face being forced into water for periods of time. I have times where my coping is strong, but I’ve had a lot of life stress recently that has brought more frequent nightmares and stressors. 

A coworker asked me if I would be willing to be a sparing partner. I have a martial arts black belt, but haven’t practiced in years. He hadn’t either, and wanted someone in a similar boat to work through his muscle memory. 

I wish I didn’t have to avoid truly telling him why I can’t. I wish I didn’t have to try and decide whether or not friendly sparing would trigger an episode. It’s like a bomb constantly waiting for the right button to be pushed; waiting for fingers to curl in just the right way, or a playful shove to have just the right amount of pressure. 

I wish I didn’t have to pull the barber aside to tell them they can’t put the hot towel over my face, I wish my knuckles weren’t white while they wash my hair. That I was able to let shower water run over my face, or let people touch me when I’m in a swimming pool. 

I want to not flinch when a hand moves too quickly. I want to not shy away from physical affection and intimacy. I want to truly feel safe and carefree in water.

In so many ways, I feel I’ve grown from the broken child I was when it all happened. But in weeks like these, years after my trauma, I feel so helpless again to the hold it has on me. I’m so worried that I’ll never be given release from the torture.

akfhwq,"The worst symptom of my PTSD is my night terror disorder. In the last month I have had 2 per week, way more than usual","I have PTSD and most specifically an extreme version of night terror disorder. I find I do have triggers (most evident one is stress) but I am trying to figure out a way to stop this.

I have tried CBD oil and it does seem to help, along with weed but my work drug tests so I can't do that. And I have read that CBD can cause you to show up with false positive so I only can use it rarely.

akg83o,"Being a witness not knowing what to do, feeling like the event wasnt real","TW: rape.

About 6 months ago a girl was raped in my neiborhood. I heard her and couldnt do anything because I froze.
My parents were asleep (it happend between 2 and 3 midnight). I decided to keep it to myself.
My parents are toxic and telling them could get me in trouble. Going to the police could get me in trouble for being involved.

Thursday I came back from work. I rode my through my neibourhood when I saw two men walking. This is nearby a playground and it was around 10 in the evening. I found it odd as it was cold outside and there was snow. As I kept looking behind them I saw a female figure on hands and knees.

That is when my memory fractured as if someone threw a stone through a window.
I mainly remember her bare hands.

I started to disociate and put my bike away. When I sort of actually not really calmed down I walked back to the place where I saw the 3 people and searched for them (this was a few minutes later) went looking for them for 20 minitues but found no one.

I feel like I might have imagened it even though I know what I saw was real. 

Maybe I am wrong and nothing happend, but why would she be on the ground on her hands and knees while there was snow on the ground?

Being a witnessed is the worst thing that ever happend to me. Being almost kidnapped myself and getting molested was so much easier.

I feel so guilty for not being able to take action when I thought something was wrong instead of waiting a few minutes even though I know I couldnt have done anything and I had no control over myself at that moment.

I am in therapy, but I go there mainly to talk about my parents. I cant talk about any trauma that involved anything sexual such as molestation or witnessing what I just witnessed.

So I will put it here, because I know that putting it out there will make me feel lighter.
I hope that you wont be disapointed in me for not taking action, I am sorry.",skshenrj,2019-01-27 13:45:33,0,387,16.43,8.96,95.62,2.65,14.88,16.28,91.99,62.79,21.19,14.73,12.4,0,0.26,1.03,1.03,6.46,4.39,12.4,10.34,8.27,8.53,3.1,21.19,4.39,2.58,2.33,2.07,1.03,3.62,0.52,3.1,0.26,0.52,0.26,5.94,0.78,0,1.55,0.26,14.73,3.88,1.29,2.07,3.88,0.52,4.13,4.65,2.07,0.26,2.33,2.84,1.55,0.52,0.78,0,4.91,0.78,0.52,1.03,1.29,1.29,8.01,7.75,1.55,13.95,3.36,6.2,4.91,0.52,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.04,6.2,1.29,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,1.03,0
akgub8,I feel like PTSD is taking over my life,(F23) I was sexually abused as a very young child and never knew how to express how I feel. As I got older and intentionally made myself get fat so that no one would look at me or try and abuse of me again. When I was 21 I was in college getting my life together and I was sexually assaulted by someone who I thought was a friend. I am now 23 years old and have been in a relationship for the past 2 years. I love my partner so much but I don't think he always understands me. When I first met my boyfriend he was very understanding with everything that had happened to me. He would hold me when I would get really bad anxiety or flashbacks. I still get flashbacks and anxiety but it seems like my boyfriend gets annoyed with it so I try to push all my pain back. I have lost all motivation in life and am trying to get myself to be normal again. I recently have lost about 50lb I'm trying to love my body again and get back in shape. It has helped in my relationship because my boyfriend can't keep his hands off of me...in a good way. But I can't keep pushing all my feelings behind. How do I get over all of this? I have gone to counseling but it makes things worse because when I go home and try to sleep I feel like I'm re living everything. How do I make it stop and help myself build motivation to feel free and like myself again?

I’m almost 27, am losing my hair to stress and my complex ptsd controls my life and I self isolate because being around people is so emotionally dysregulating. 

I’m skinny, feel unattractive, my fit hair conditioner still makes my hair frizzy, and Im single as heck with no friends because I push everyone away. I’m also stressed because I haven’t been able to move into an apartment I wanted because my slum landlord hasn’t fixed the lead based paint hazards. So all month me and my lawyer have been stressing and trying to negotiate. I think we are going to court this week and I’m so nervous. I really hope it goes in my favor and they either break my lease with them or are forced to fix everything. I also start my new receptionist job in a week that has nothing to do with the masters degree I just graduated with because I can’t go into social work at this time because I have to save myself. Also, I’m pmsing big time, which is making everything worse. I am also experiencing chronic neck and upper back pain and it sucks. Also I’m in the cold Midwest so I’ve been at home watching movies all alone all week.

I just wanna be pretty, have a boyfriend, have friends, be happy, and be ptsd free!

On a positive note... I start dbt this week. I also start emdr in March.

akicmy,Ex boyfriend raped me and his ex. Feels like there will never be a happy ending. Possibly trigger warning ⚠️,"I’m sober now and have to deal with the shit that happened to me for the first time. It’s not fair that sometimes nothing happens to shitty people. His ex who came out and told people in high school was called a liar and ostracized for telling people. She was told by his friends to stop lying and she was never taken seriously. I’d heard about this but all his friends reassured me he was a nice guy and would never hurt a fly. 

We dated for a few years and he’d showed multiple signs of abuse but I had almost everyone around me defending him, which made me feel crazy. He also made me feel crazy and told me things I experienced didn’t happen. He’d yell at me and corner me and yell in my face then deny it ever happening. He’d threaten to break up with me and tell everyone what a bitch I was. When I didn’t want to have sex he’d guilt me into it so I would cry during, which would only make him angry. Then one time he stuck his finger in my butt and I told him to stop it hurt but he didn’t stop. He just kept going until I was crying and begging him to stop. I pleaded because it hurt but he just ignored me. Then after he finished I went in the bathroom and just locked myself in and cried. I felt like no one would believe me since no one believed when he had fits of rage and I felt like I was stuck. Eventually I was able to leave but he didn’t make it easy and harassed me for months after. Even now a couple years later he still randomly decides to harass me. I feel helpless and like I can’t do anything. I shouldn’t have to be nice to someone who raped me, but I do because I don’t want to set him off. 

I feel guilt that he will do this to someone else since he’s already done it to me and his old ex. I don’t want anyone else to go through this, but I don’t feel like police believe when a boyfriend rapes and I know his friends/family won’t believe it either. He’s a professional victim and would end up making me look like I’m trying to ruin his life when he’s ruined mine. I can never feel safe and I feel worried about my family’s safety and mine. 

He comes off as this dumb nice guy, but he isn’t. He’s dumb, but he’s manipulative and evil. I just want to be able to at least smoke weed again so the nightmares and anxiety will go away. I feel like the only way for it to go away would be for him to be in jail for life or to die, but I can’t rely on either happening at least not anytime soon. 

I don’t know if I’m asking for advice or what, but maybe I just needed to get it out since I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone about it. Maybe it’d be nice if someone had a similar story or if someone even had a happy ending to a story like this out there. It feels like there will be no happy ending with him.

About 2 years ago I finally was fully divorced from my x wife (separates for two years) and she put me through hell and back and mentally and physically abused me... long story short she would cheat on me and had he phone on super lock down and never allow me to see anything EVER she would have random men blowing up her phone and I caught her on recording bringing men home into the apartment I provided while I worked 50+ hour work weeks and white my youngest son home with her to witness these other men..... needless to say I tried hard to be there for my son and needless to say for my well being and sanity I had to leave sadly I didn’t learn and went back while I went into the corps and tried to give her a second chance needless to say old habits die hard and I had to shop her back to the states..... the whole point of this is I have serious trust issues and my ocd/ptsd effects not only my relationship but also my work because I’m unable to concentrate or do much of anything because I seriously feel my gut sink and everything around me starts spinning and I totally freak out and worry and get really sad etc and no matter what I tell myself and no matter how irrational I know I’m being and acknowledge I’m unable to stop until she messages me (woke up from nap or finally picked up phone off charger etc...) 

I guess my question is without getting super deep is.... have anyone been able to come out of this state and get to a point of not having mental breakdowns and not living through the emotions and eventually stop making the accusations? I’m just curious if there is hope...

I also have a lot of other really fucked up things like my very first boss raped and molested me and I have issues with coworkers and peers and my bosses today but not nearly as bad as what it does for my relationship so just had anyone find treatment as a real help or is it all common sense and I’m SOL...???",Blu3_Scr33n,2019-01-28 07:09:14,3,428,25.03,20.67,87.96,2.69,38.91,13.55,92.99,60.51,17.76,13.79,10.98,0,0,2.8,0,3.97,3.04,14.72,9.11,6.78,12.15,2.34,16.59,4.67,1.4,0.7,1.4,1.4,5.14,1.17,3.74,0.7,1.4,0.47,10.51,1.17,0,3.04,1.87,13.79,2.8,1.87,1.4,4.21,1.64,4.67,2.8,0.47,1.4,0.7,1.64,0.23,0.93,0.47,0,7.94,1.4,3.04,2.1,0.7,0.93,4.44,10.98,0.47,13.79,1.64,6.78,5.84,1.87,0.93,0.7,0.23,0.23,0.23,0.93,0.7,0,0,0.23,0,12.38,7.01,0,0,0,1.17,0,0,0,2.1,1.4,0.7
akonl2,Can anyone tell me the difference between PTSD and C-PTSD? It's confusing me. [LONG],"Apparently I've got C-PTSD, even though it's not in the manual yet.  
But I searched online and from what I can tell it's PTSD with a few symptoms of BPD.  
That does make sense as he did say because he can't actually diagnosis me with C-PTSD, he would diagnosis me with PTSD and BPD.  
This was 2 years ago.  
I had another mental health evaluation 3 weeks ago.  
They said that I'm not exhibiting the key symptoms of BPD.  
But I do have a quite a few of Schizophrenia, but not enough to make a diagonsis of it, and I've got pretty good insight of my illness and I'm mostly functioning so I don't fit the criteria.  
My question is can my Psychotic symptoms be apart of my C-PTSD?

akt5d2,PTSD and digitizing childhood vhs tapes,"Hi, I need to talk about this because I don't have anyone I'm comfortable sharing with.

I am going to bring up a couple things that I'm struggling with and share some background so this makes sense. I am F/29 and I am a *survivor* (never said or typed that before) of abuse by the hands, words and actions of a few people. Some of these people I am just now realizing did things to me and happen to still be in my life. This is why I'm posting. I don't know how to manage the way I'm feeling about these flashbacks.

I realized it wasn't just my father who abused me as a child. My childhood vhs tapes. My father narrates and is the man behind the camera in 98% of these tapes. I have probably 20+ vhs tapes I am digitizing for my sister and mother. I knew it could trigger some panic attacks or flash backs to hear or see my father on these videos, but I decided I was strong and I could handle it so my family could share in these memories and I can edit him out as a gift. None of us speak with my father anymore due to his abuse of drugs and us. This is hard to type because I hate seeing this in my head again and it feels horrible. I apologize for how oddly this is written, I'm in a state of shock I think because of what I'm learning.

**Background**

Growing up I have a couple blurry memories or flashbacks of my father doing things that are wrong. One flashback is of me and my mother nude hiding in their closet, wrapped up in their comforter while he is yelling. Another memory is him following me up the stairs and pulling my pants down. Another is him putting his tongue in my mouth. All of these I believe I was maybe 5-7 or even 8? I don't really know. I didn't say anything until I remembered the first thing when I was 15. My parents were divorced when I was 13 or 14 due to his drinking and drugging and abusive ways. I have one sister who is 18 months younger than myself. I also have a very saddening memory of my father being angry with her for not staying upright on her bike (she was probably 4 or 5? so I was 6 or 7). He had cornered us in the laundry room and he was hitting her with a broomstick as she tried to climb into a cabinet where her shoes were kept. I was on my back kicking at him. Her little knees were bleeding so badly from falling on her bike. I don't know why I remember this incident so vividly. CPS has been called on my father 3 times. I don't know much but he was taken to court after me telling a therapist about the first flashback at 15. My mother tells me that she ""made it to where I didn't have to testify"". I don't know a lot about the court case. I know my father is re-married to a woman who is younger than him by at least 10 yrs. She had a 3 and 5 y/o when they married. Those kids are now much older and finishing high school and starting college. I know their father was worried about what my father had done to me and wanted to keep his children safe. I wish I was able to learn the details of these things. I only have my mother as my source and she can be misleading at times and also doesn't remember everything either.

I had stopped all contact with my father at 15 and ended up in treatment by the age of 17 because I was an emotional wreck. I think I still am. Anyway, once I turned 19 a boyfriend (who was also abusive and much older than myself by 10 yrs) convinced me that I needed my father in my life. I regret being convinced every day. I cut ties with him and his blood relatives when I was 26. He had told me he solved an argument with my step brother (who was 13 or 14 at the time) by ""quickly and physically ending the disagreement"". After hearing that I got out of his car, said ""goodbye"" and never spoke to him again. I was frozen. I felt that it was my fault. My step brother ended up in treatment similar to mine for some time. I don't know how he is doing now since I don't speak with my father's side, but I hope he's alright. I also hope my little step sister is alright. I don't know if I can forgive myself for ""leaving"" them.

**The Videos**

I started digitizing and felt fine with hearing his voice at first. It kind of sounds like an old video tape instead of what he sounded like 3 years ago in person or even on the phone. I thought ""Ok, I can do this just fine, just start with the tapes that Mom and sister will like to see first."" This was turning out to be great because I could see my grand parents and great grand parents, my aunt and mother and myself and my sister. I couldn't stop watching. My mind was racing. I chose a tape that was labeled ""1996"" - I realized there were a few copies of the same footage with the same label. I watched this tape and it's pretty normal until it stops and comes on and I hear my father saying things about how it's early in the morning. How he's going to show me this in the morning. I am heard saying ""no"" and clearly uncomfortable. Watching this I was horrified. I can see is the dimly lit room that was clearly the master bedroom floor. I am laying on the floor under a blanket. I am watching this for the first time my husband and I were looking at each other in shock. I immediately stopped it and was sobbing. Why would my dad take that video? What is the reason for that? Is that video part of what my first flashback was or was this a regular occurrence that I still can't remember?

I was alarmed to see footage of my father dropping me down a slide when I was barely able to walk. My mother reacted clearly upset and the camera went off as you hear me screaming. There was another tape from ""1996"" where I'm crying hysterically and it keeps cutting in and out of weird conversation with me sobbing. My little sister is trying to comfort me. My mother is not there. I can almost remember parts of this that aren't on camera. My dad says something to me, as he is shooting the video, about how no one thinks I'm a brat, and he asks ""right?"" to my sister and she says something like ""only mom and dad think \_\_\_\_\_\_ is a brat."" He quickly corrects her and she seems to look like she's confused by his manipulation. The camera goes off and then comes back on to my face. My hair is soaked with tears and is stuck to my face from crying so much. I believe my dad starts telling me to go to bed and I refuse and cry more. Watching this I can tell that I'm afraid to go to bed because I know what he's going to do. I won't get into that because I don't truly remember much. I know it's blocked out and I'm afraid to watch more because It could all come back.

I gave myself a couple days after that footage. I was afraid I'd see something worse. I decided to watch my sisters birthday party in 1996. It was on another tape labeled ""1996"". My sister is turning 5 and we are at the local pool with some childhood friends and some family. I see my cousin and I see my childhood friend. I instantly remember inappropriate things happening with those boys. My cousin used to pretend we were ""married"" when we were around that age. He would make me go into a bathroom after our ""marriage"" and undress with him. He always locked the door. He is about 2 years older than I am. I remember feeling like it was wrong but that he was older so it must be ok. I don't remember much of what happened in the bathrooms when this stuff used to happen. I know for sure it happened in 2 places. I know I was crying at one of them and my sister was knocking on the door. It was a family vacation. He has a daughter now and she is about 5. I hate him.

My childhood friend I mentioned, he also made me take my clothes off because of what ""grown ups do when they get married"". This must have been at the same age as my cousin incident. I remember something weird he did once he made me lay on top of him, he said we had to touch nipples....then I remember his mother walked in on us. I felt instant embarrassment and guilt, but being so young, I didn't know exactly what was wrong. She never said anything or did anything. This friend is still in my life and also has a brand new daughter. They were at my wedding and so was that cousin. I feel sick thinking about this. How could his mother not have done anything!!?? I saw her face in that video too and felt even more sick. Once we were in the high school ages, we spent more time together. He talked me into cheating on my boyfriends because ""kissing isn't cheating"". He'd feel me up and I told myself it was ok because we weren't having sex. I hate myself for this.

I hate seeing these people on my video tapes and remembering these things. It makes me feel like my family isn't real. It makes me question if things really happened even though I know certain things definitely did. I continue to doubt myself and pretend I'm ok. I'm not ok. I'm having a very hard time with these new things and I feel physically sick reliving these things.

**Can having abusers in life be a pattern for some survivors?**

I have had far too many moments in my life where my innocence was taken from me or I was hurt in different ways. I was raped by an ex for years. He took photos of me after he drugged me when he took me out of the country. He was so much like my father. So many red flags and I should have ran screaming, but he was SO manipulative. He told me no one would ever love me like he loved me. He exposed me to HEP-C for years and never told me. He cheated on me. He would tell me I was overweight and that my style was boring. He told me I didn't ""do anything"". He would force me to have sex with him every day multiple times a day. I was fresh from treatment, he was sober and had been for years. I thought he was safe. He even convinced my mother he was great along with other family. He has thousands of nude photos of me from the age of 18-22. He refused to destroy them when I begged for many years. He'd always convince me to come back when I'd leave him or when he said something painfully horrible. He'd show up at my apartments while I was in college in the middle of the night yelling at me. He was a 3x felon. He was an addict and when I left for good, he started drinking again and then using drugs. No idea where he is now, but I pray it's prison. He had his 3 strikes.

I also have been in a friendship where a guy in college became obsessed with me and stalked me. I had to go to the Dean of Students because he had signed up to be in every one of my classes. This was after he had left things at my doorstep, stood outside my front door at 3am whispering my name and sending me paragraphs about how he wanted to ""practice having sex"" with me ""because we are best friends"" and he ""felt like I would give him feedback"" *WHAT THE FUCK!?* \- Guess what - the college only asked him to change classes. That's it. The Dean told me they would kick him out of the college, expel him from classes that semester or ask him to change his classes. I had to tell all my professors on my own because the college didn't have my back. He even showed up in NY when I moved after college, and I moved across the country.....I finally got rid of him when I moved from NY.

There was a guy in college who raped me because I was too drunk to drive home one night. He offered his bed and he slept on the couch until he joined me in bed later that night. I woke up and he was having sex with me. I remember he noticed I woke up and put a condom on. I was frozen. I didn't know what to do. I left when I could see the sun was coming up. I wouldn't talk to him and he acted like he didn't know what was wrong. He'd even send me texts if he was on the same bus to tell me he was behind me. I'm still confused by that.

I'm sorry I spilled this mess here. I have a lot in my head and I don't know how to get it out. I have no one to talk to. No one understands unless they've had these things happen. I'm tired of sharing with someone I feel I can share with and they tell me they don't believe me, or ghost me completely. I had began to keep it all to myself for a few years in college and now I'm busting at the seams with flashbacks and panic attacks. I had a flashback when I was skiing with my husband this year. My father did things to me once when he was teaching me to ski as a kid. I was in the trees and it all came back. I don't know how to talk to my husband about these things. He doesn't understand. He means well and he's good to me, but he will never understand what I feel and what happened to me. I've never been able to really heal from any of this and I'm just now remembering things. I feel like a pile of used, damaged crap. I'm in a new city now, and I don't have any close friends here. I feel lonely and these flashbacks have affected my social abilities. I'm always on edge and I just thought I could share on here and someone might be able to tell me I'm not crazy and that I'm not bad for what happened. I feel I am though.",hemtuh27,2019-01-28 14:44:11,3,2570,15.94,33.57,83.68,9.5,14.2,12.76,93.58,62.3,24.79,18.68,12.92,0.51,0.04,4.71,0.51,6.11,3.74,12.92,11.25,5.72,7.78,2.02,21.13,3.74,2.1,2.3,2.26,1.95,4.75,1.71,3.04,0.7,0.93,0.43,12.61,2.76,0.43,1.71,5.25,11.63,3.58,2.02,1.21,2.37,1.25,2.37,3.62,1.44,1.09,0.97,1.98,0.7,0.86,0.43,0.16,6.61,2.72,0.89,1.83,0.66,0.62,8.25,10.62,0.58,13.93,1.83,6.3,6.15,1.13,1.01,0.93,0.04,0.04,0.04,0.51,0.08,0.04,0.27,0.04,0.04,14.98,7.08,1.17,0,0,0.39,0.12,0.27,1.48,2.88,0.31,1.28
akthfe,Everything keeps hitting me all at once,"Let me start this by saying I have PTSD. Everything hits me a bit harder than most people so if you think this is nothing, it may be for you but for me it's hell.

Let's start with last week. I contacted Amazon over a pretty simple request. I'm on disability and didn't receive my cheque for December. I've been scraping by for that month and this by dumpster diving and panhandling. Merry Christmas to me I guess. At any rate, I contacted Amazon customer service with an off hand request. I had gotten a Prime trial and asked them if they could extend it for a month for free. I explained the situation. Didn't expect anything from it at all, but the reaction I got was weird. The person I was chatting to on their website started asking for order numbers. I said nevermind and ended the chat. 13 hours later he emails me to say he didn't understand what I was talking about and said to contact again. So I did. Weirdly, the second person was like ""No problem, done. Go enjoy The Grand Tour!"" So I tried to get on Prime and it didn't work. Figured I'd let it be for a couple days. 

While waiting, my roommate comes back. He left in November to go to India for the holidays. I forgot how much noise he made. He's on the phone at all hours of the day and night. He often puts the other person on speaker phone and will yell his responses. I can't sleep. I mean I can't afford my medication to sleep properly anyway, but this asshole is so fucking loud that I couldn't sleep if I did have the meds. I've gotten maybe 2-3 hours sleep since he returned last week. I turned the music on once at 10AM and he had the nerve to tell me to turn it down. That pissed me off even more. 

While all this is going on, I'm waiting for the government to tell me what happened to my disability cheque. They keep saying they're doing investigations and will have another sent out as soon as it's done, but that does fucking nothing for me. We don't have food stamps here so I can't go get that. Food bank is miles away and my knees are fucked, so getting there is hell to begin with and coming back takes multiple hours. Even if I did get there, I don't have a current statement from the government with my address on it because they didn't send the goddamned cheque. 

So I go back to Amazon. Prime still isn't working. So Customer Service tells me it's just a glitch and they'll reach out to me in 12 hours. They do. 12 hours later they say I never had prime to begin with. So I contact customer service AGAIN. This time I get someone who calls me darling every 3 seconds despite me asking repeatedly for her to knock it off. She says that they did give me an extension on the prime but it was an extension of nothing because the prime was already over. She then hangs up on me. So I say fuck it and tweet Amazon. They respond and ask what's wrong. I explain. At this point I don't care about the free prime. I had no right to it anyway, I always thought it was a longshot, but being told a half dozen different things is just bizarre and confusing. They then don't respond for a day. So I say ""Uh hello?"" And another amazon rep comes on twitter to ask what's wrong. I explain again. No response. Today, 4 days later, I say that it's the worst service I've received. Amazon immediately jumps on and gives me a link to contact. I do and don't even get a chance to explain. The dude just says another department will reach out to me.

Then I turn to Canada Post and ask why the hell I didn't get stuff delivered. They shrug and say ""We deliver until 8PM."" I'm checking the mail continuously. We have no mail and no one else has gotten mail in the neighborhood. We live next door to a Canada Post and have never had this problem before. Maybe it's the weather? No. People across the road got their mail. Just that we didn't. So no cheque for me today despite being told I'd get it today. That means no eating today, no meds today, no paying bills today. Sitting in the dark crying all night. 

Like I said it in't much. But this is overwhelming to all hell to me and I'm freaking the fuck out. I want to beat the shit out of my roommate because he won't shut the fuck up, I want to scream my goddamn head off at Amazon because they won't give me a straight fucking answer. I want to lose my shit at the government because they lost my cheque and i've been without any money since the start of December. 

To top it all off, a storm kicked up at 3PM and I can't go dumpster diving for any food. Tomorrow it's going to be worse and colder so I won't be able to go dumpster diving then either AND the mail likely won't show up again.

aktrhk,I’m sorry if this is not the appropriate group for this! /Trigger warning/ *long* kind of,"Since 2001 (when I was aged 9-10) I’ve experienced this. I’ve only recently begun thinking it could be some kind of PTSD-like symptom, but I don’t know.

But sometimes, I get The Feeling. The Feeling is when I’m met with an overwhelming and very, very deep feeling of disgust, discomfort and trauma. Things that can trigger it are hearing about child sexual abuse, especially when it’s described in detail, and (this one is odd) androgynous or feminine sounding men. For instance, I liked of one of the songs of Cigarettes After Sex. But when I heard another, the singer’s feminine but male voice was an instant trigger and I had an anxiety attack + the ‘feeling’. I’ve never been able to properly describe The Feeling, but the best words I can describe it with are disgust, discomfort, wrong, no.

The thing is though, I have no recollection of anything in my past or childhood that would explain it. The closest thing to an incident I can think of is when I was 6, the teenage boy next door came up to me and said that if I kissed him he’d give me candy. I said no. He then started following me around school (I was in pre-school. I think that’s the proper term. I’m not American.) but this school had classes from grade 0 to grade 10. I just feel like this shouldn’t be “enough” to trigger such a serious condition. Perhaps my mind is weak.

I am by the way diagnosed with schizophrenia, anxiety and depression.

akvrf0,I lost the woman I loved because of PTSD,"First time poster on here but I’m just seeking advice from other people with similar experiences.

Long story short I was in a 4 year relationship with an abusive woman. I already had combat related PTSD when we were dating and she knew that and I think she manipulated that.

She would threaten to kill me and my friends, beat me and attacked me. I snapped one day and picked her up by the throat and threw her on the floor and told her she wasn’t going to kill anyone, that she doesn’t know what that does to your soul. 

After it was over I tried to kill myself. I felt like a monster for what I had done.

I was stopped and baker acted and got help and put on medication. It helped but this woman would come back into my life and prod at me and pull me back in only to torture me. This went on for two years of the 4 years.

She ended up leaving for another man and I was okay with that, I wanted peace.

I ended up meeting someone amazing and I fell hard. She was everything I could have wanted in a person and so kind and gentle and driven.

But while we’re together, we would do things and I’d get these waves of emotions relating to my abusive ex and i couldn’t place why I was thinking about her and I felt terrible.

There was pressure of marriage and I hadn’t sorted out the unknowns feelings yet and my anxiety skyrocketed so I broke up because it felt wrong to be thinking about someone else while I was this amazing woman.

I’d later come to find out through a therapy session what these emotions were. I was diagnosed again with PTSD relating to an abusive relationship.

It was clarity and I realized that this amazing woman was what I wanted but it was too late. She felt like I used her to heal myself and left afterwards but it’s not the case, not at all. But I can’t change the way she feels and I lost her trust.

We were romantically involved but she essentially broke up with me and ended things. Now I feel numb and don’t know what to do. I still love her so much and I she’s my best friend and I feel like she’s my person but now I’m heartbroken and numb and tired. 

Please help.",50SahdesOfBrown,2019-01-28 19:18:09,1,420,12.03,39.66,89.63,13,16.8,13.33,95.48,63.1,25,17.62,11.9,0.95,0.24,4.52,0,7.38,3.1,11.9,9.29,5,11.19,1.9,20.48,3.33,1.67,1.67,1.19,0.71,8.1,3.33,4.29,0.71,2.14,1.19,13.33,0.24,0.48,5.71,0.24,12.86,4.76,1.67,1.9,0.71,0.48,3.33,2.38,0,0,2.14,2.38,0.24,1.43,0,0.24,8.81,3.81,1.67,3.1,0.71,0.95,11.43,6.67,0.24,15,2.62,6.67,6.19,0.48,0,0.24,0,0.24,0.71,0.48,0,0,0.24,0,0,10.24,5.71,1.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.33,0,0

YES YOU SPEAK UP tell someone immediately if it’s not to late my boss would turn the cameras off and sit next to me and hold me down while he rubbed himself on me and my genitalia even though I was 16 and he was 30+ with a husband and a kid at home (who he adopted mind you just that year I started working there) and I kept telling him no and yet here I am I felt like I couldn’t tell my family because they’d kill him and end up in jail and even if I told them or the cops the cop that would visit and ask if I’m going to come out with them over the weekend and I deny because I know better and I get stuck because guess what this cop could end up getting the call what happens if he’s in with his boss then what I’d be either beaten or incriminated in some way shape or form..... and here I sit with the x wife who provided no moral support and never offered to help and would make fun of me and I would be stuck day in and day out working just to support her and I never quit because of her.... (girlfriend at the time but x wife now sadly didn’t learn she was just using me...) 

Anyways, speak up go to the cops contact state police go above if you have to because in hindsight I could of called state police and been able to fucked them all over and now I sit here and think how many more victims are out there because I never spoke up... so don’t just do it for yourself but do it for the next possible innocent victims who is about to have their life ruined when all it takes is you to have moral courage and speak up and get help!

Please stop being a victim and save yourself and others while you still can!

akwr9a,Am I making a mountain out of a molehill?,"Hi all,

I bike to work every day, and two weeks ago I was tapped by the back of a bus going round a corner downhill. I fishtailed, lost control of my bike and crashed into the curb, flipping twice into a bar of shrubs and landing 3m from my bike and losing consciousness. I came to on the foot path, a passing car having stopped to help. My bike was badly damaged, but I wasn't, miraculously; my basket was completely mangled, but all I had was a mild concussion, some road rash, impressive bruises, a torn ligament in my shoulder and a sprained wrist. Considering I was going at 40km p/h and the bus was going significantly more, it's miraculous. I lodged a police report but because I was knocked out and didn't remember much, there is nothing I can do with them, and the bus is being an utter jerk and denying everything.

Now I have been in bike accidents before as a teenager, even ones involving a bus. I was dazed, but fine, and now my bike is fixed. I was totally cool with the idea of biking again, right up until I started biking to work this morning, when I started feeling nauseous and anxious. I kept feeling like I would lose control of my bike, or that a car would clip me. This was pretty irrational, but I still felt unduly worried, imo. I'm familiar with trauma causing PTSD (I lived through a large series of earthquakes in Christchurch from 2010 - 2014) but this seems kind of.... unwarranted? I was ultimately fine, and before today I was more pissed off that it's costing me $600 to fix my bike. 

TL; DR I was hit by a bus the other week on my bicycle, I only received minor injuries, I am now concerned by riding but it feels like I am making a mountain out of a molehill.

akwxv6,Can I call myself a survivor? (CW: sexual assault),"

Basically I tried out tinder and met this guy and agreed to a date and then he tried to make it into this weird week long relationship thing I didn’t want and when I tried to back out he guilt tripped me. I mean I wanted out but I figured the relationship was going to be over after the date anyway bc we agreed to that so I just sucked it up and went with it. Then when we did stuff he stopped when I said no but he didn’t really ask before doing anything and I froze up but he kept going. Like he didn’t care whether I was comfortable. And that really fucked me up.  I feel like what happened is my fault and I was just weak and stupid. I feel like a fraud calling myself a survivor (although I did experience emotional abuse in another later relationship). I just want to feel okay again especially with sex.

akz1u1,"The cops, his friends, decided that all documented injuries were from consensual BDSM. Never insinuate that I didn’t do enough, or I made myself a victim. I was 16, I had no support. The injuries were a mandated report from a doctor and when I got home no one was there for me.","TW: rape


I did what I was supposed to do and at this interview, which was forced on me by a doctor, I was asked if I enjoyed it, orgasmed, was into BDSM, “liked it rough” or said no clearly. They concluded that bc he was suffocating me, I must not have said no clearly, so he didn’t hear. So all injuries including a ripped ass were apparently BDSM. 

I understand that people tend to blame themselves because if they know what they did “wrong” then in their heads if they don’t do the “wrong” thing again they will be safe. the reality is, no one is ever safe. There are things we can do to make us safer or at least feel safer. so to be healthy we kinda have to balance the vulnerability that comes from knowing it wasn’t our fault with the feeling that we are constantly in danger. 

but if you’re victim blaming to feel safe keep it to yourself. Don’t be a toxic person and put your own insecurities on MY shoulders by telling me I didn’t do enough or I’m making myself a victim or it’s MY fault.

al06w5,PTSD &amp; Mdma treatment,"It seems the last post on here about that was awhile ago, so I thought I would give it a shot and ask if anyone has recently participated in that research study with MDMA and treating PTSD. I've been checking out the MAPS site and found a local study and reached out to them. I haven't heard back yet (it was only yesterday I emailed them). 

Just curious if anyone has participated, what was your experience, and did it help? I know a lot of people have tried it recreationally and tried to self-treat, just interested if anyone actually did the real study with the therapy and everything. 

Thank you in advance. My heart goes out to all of you dealing with PTSD... my boyfriend suffers from it, as related to combat and I hope we can find not only a counselor he trusts (he has a hard time with counseling - if he doesn't vibe with the person or thinks they are bullshitting him, he will walk away - he is realllllly intelligent and smart and needs someone who doesn't treat him like an idiot).

al1k55,Getting to the “meat” of my trauma,"Insurance stopped covering my therapy, so I can no longer wax poetic about why I hate driving or how much I hate interacting with strangers.

Nope. Can’t do that anymore as every session needs to be focused on the biggest part of my trauma. The real meat, which is the fact that I absolutely hate myself and hate myself for being abused. 

I am literally disgusted by myself. My female body parts. They make me want to gag. I feel like a child again being forced into sexuality again. I don’t know that I’ll EVER feel like a ‘woman’ and I get grossed out thinking about sex and body parts. 

As a kid I was forced to feel sexual like an adult and do sexual deeds. Now as a “woman” I feel like a kid and just want to retreat into my head. 

I guess I am just venting. Last night EMDR got nowhere close to helping me feel less repulsed. I’m pretty sad and worried it won’t ever get better.

al29za,Reoccurring denial of diagnosis?,"Hey guys. So, last night, I had a very long and vivid dreams about one of the people who abandoned/mentally abused me (and one of the two people that caused the traumatic event that led to my diagnosis a year or so later), woke up crying at 4am. I woke up a couple hours later for work, since I had to go in, and decided on my bus ride that I felt bad enough to take CBD. 
Long story short, I feel pretty fine now, the CBD is still kind of in my system. But I have been thinking about what it would be like to finally talk to my abusers about all of the things I've discovered or thought about since the whole event happened (I haven't spoken with them in over a year, for sure) and it's making me feel like a fraud - this happens a lot. Like I don't have PTSD even though I've been diagnosed by a doctor and reassured by my therapist.

To keep my bum out of the fire that has been threatened, gonna keep this as anon as i can. 

23ish years ago some really bad things happened in my family. 3 years later visits started happening and at the end of each visit tiny me would beg to go with the person leaving. They'd leave me behind.
Looking at it now, they might as well have been abandoning me over and over and over for 11 years. Little me didnt understand anger or trauma, and wasnt really allowed negative emotes anyway. Once i was older, the visits stopped and i actually did go with visitor. Then the fighting started.

I didnt know how to process anger. Punching pillows and screaming didnt really help, and i didnt have anything productive to put it towards. So i ignored it and hoped it would go away. Ofc it didn't.

Fast forward to now. I'm in therapy, finally processing this shit. Realize some really upsetting stuff about visitor. Cue accidental poking of the anger that I've been ignoring and shoving down, and its like i dropped a goddamn mentos in diet coke. Fury doesn't begin to cover it and I don't know how to keep a lid on things while i do such necessary things as work and communicate with people.

tw: abuse, toxic relationship, ED mentioned, suicide mentioned

Throughout 2017 and 2018 I used to be in a long distance relationship with a girl I met on instagram. She was really sweet towards me at the beginning and I became extremely emotionally attached to her quickly due to how perfect she seemed to be.
Though once our relationship evolved further she started humiliating and threatening me, at one point she demanded me to cut off my childhood friends because she was jealous of them and suspicious of me cheating with them (which I didn’t). She would tell me, her friends and her instagram following that I was extremely toxic and abusive and that she is afraid of me, that she needs help and so on, she even told people I was the cause of her eating disorder.
I don’t know why she did that, we fought a lot, I did everything she wanted me to do - I even ended up cutting ties with my childhood friend because she kept saying “it’s either her or me” and at that point I was convinced I couldn’t live without her anymore.
But besides calling me names, starting fights with me, threatening me to kill herself and so on the one thing that stuck with me the most was that she kept telling me how terrible and abusive I am, that she was the victim and I shouldn’t cry around because it’s my own fault and because of how weak I am.
After many times of trying I broke off with her a couple of months ago. 
And even then the things kept happening, she would post online how, because of me, she would kill herself and created an account on a porn website using my image and private information (I am a minor).

I just can‘t get over it, I have nightmares about her, get flashbacks and I just don’t know how to live like this any longer. She did ruin my life and I am haunted by these memories of her, I don’t know if in truth I was the one abusing her because of all the fights and the things she spread around. It may sound stupid or delusional, I am sorry if it does and I don’t think anyone can understand what is going on with me but I had to get this off my chest. I’m so confused, angry and it hurts not knowing the truth.

Sorry in advance if the writing is bad, I'm still not over it.

When I was 12, I came out to my extended family as lesbian. While most responded ok (even though they didn't believe me), my father's mother didn't. She didn't even respond to my initial coming out text (we live 3 hours away from most family so it made sense). About 3 months later my dad and I went to her house to visit. The day before we were about to leave, she sat me down, a notebook and Bible with her while Dad was out on a morning run. She proceeded to condemn me, using quotes from the Bible and going into detail about how I'm a horrible person. At the end, she asked if I understood and if I was fine. I just nodded, afraid that if I spoke, I would burst into tears. She hugged me and let me go. I went into my room and sobbed for a good 5 minutes. The next day, we were going to leave. Dad and I got in the car and I told him what happened. He hesitated before asking me if I was ok, looking scared at what I was about to say. Now, at the time, I was a very timid, quiet, and overall emotional person. I was afraid of what people thought of me and put everyone else first. So, seeing him look at me with a look of fear just made me want to say that everything was fine. So, I did. He sighed in relief and started the drive home. For the next two years, my feelings would fester while I was forced around this woman that condemned me. Eventually my mom convinced me to tell the truth. This led to him not believing me due to more complicated issues I don't want to delve into. Since he didn't believe me, not only was I forced around her, but anytime I acted uncomfortable and/or she complained, I would get the ""you need to respect your elders"" talk. It eventually all ended when my therapist diagnosed me with PTSD. Now I am not forced around her but since I still live with my father, I am constantly reminded. Not only is he part of the trauma, but he has pictures of her around the house. I can't stand to go around churches, I hate even thinking about Christianity (even though, logically, I know it isn't religion that is inherently homophobic), and I can't stand the name Judy or brown, short, curly hair. It's been almost a year and I'm going through treatment, but I've started having nightmares about the whole thing and I can't stop blaming myself for being so weak. It doesn't help that this is something small when compared to other things.

al52yu,Child Protection Worker Living Past Traumas,"I was diagnosed with PTSD in my early 20’s and had success with treatment in lessening my flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, and general feelings of anxiety. I felt like I was a success story. 

I wanted to become a social worker because I enjoy helping others and making them see the light I once thought did not exist. I still believe it is there. 

My experience was in school social work at the high school I graduated from. I also have been working as an associate psychotherapist to get my clinical hours for the next portion of my license. I feel like my empathy and first-hand knowledge have really helped me to connect with my clients. I have remained grounded and still considered myself to be a success story. 

Since April, I changed jobs to working as a child protection worker. I was positive I had overcome the triggers of my past and was ready to help children who deserved a voice and to feel safe. However, as of this month, my symptoms have started creeping back. I have been having high anxiety on a daily basis. I notice myself isolating more and more. I have been having difficulty sleeping in my apartment alone and tend to sleep over my mom’s house even though she is also a huge trigger to me. I have been having nightmares and find myself dissociating frequently. 

I wish I could take a mental health day or a vacation but I’m scared that my anxiety will get worse because the workload just piles up when you’re gone. I know I need to find a therapist and do self-care but I frequently work overtime and never have time with the two jobs I’m working.

One thing I found is the scary similarities between PTSD that occurs in youth(formative years) and the more widely accepted understandable combat/adult PTSD.
In fact the only differences I've found are 
1: consent/awareness of origin
2: society's reaction
3: options available

al6jqp,I feel stuck as a little girl most of the time I’m awake and it’s hard to explain,"It’s so hard to explain because nobody actually understand what I mean. I was sexually abused from the time I was six from when my parents discovered me twirling around in my cousins dress. I’m transgender and my parents weren’t having any of it. That’s when the sexual abuse and physical and mental abuse started. I was raped almost every night for twelve years till I ran away on my eighteenth birthday. They didn’t want me, and when ever I tried to kill myself they would just bring me back. No one ever believed me not even the police and if I ever told they would just make it worse. I was just a sweet child and all I wanted them to do was love me but they hated me so much. And as I got older all it did was get worse. And when you know this is going to happen to you every night you come home from school it really ruins having a social life or friends. I wasn’t allowed toys I wasn’t allowed fun things. When I left my parents I moved in with an adoptive family who decided they didn’t want me when I started transitioning and then they kicked me out. So most of my life I’ve been abused and abandoned. I Live with a roommate now and even he is kicking me out because of his girlfriend. But mentally I feel stuck mentally at a young age because I never had a chance to grow up, I have all these toys and stuff I never got a chance to have when I was little, I play with them I don’t care they make me happy. I like to play dress up I like stuffed animals I like all these things I never got a chance to play with or do. Because whenever I close my eyes or whenever I try to be normal all I picture are all of those terrible things that happened to me and it’s awful. Seeing that and feeling that I just feel so gross inside. And knowing that no one will ever want me, I have no one to call mom or dad, I have no family, I have no one to comfort me when I’m sad or depressed. I have no one. And it makes me want to die. I’m autistic and have had the early stages of schizophrenia and I’m just so sad and hurt and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m just such a screw up no one could bare to ever want.

al70z0,When is the right time to inform your partner about your ptsd?,"I have ptsd from my childhood. Mostly emotional abuse, but some physical, specifically an attack in a car. I’ve gotten a lot better in that I don’t have panic attacks in cars unless someone is yelling. But I do have some small triggers. If a man moves quickly near me or reaches his hand out too quickly, certain phrases, and certain men that look like my abuser can cause me to panic, noticeably flinch, experience severe paranoia, or even have a panic attack. 

In the past, I’ve let my partners know in advance to avoid behaviors that might set me off. But they all seemed to worry so much about it that their entire behavior changed. They would do something small (like move too fast) and if it triggered me, they would feel so guilty about it that they keep a distance from me for awhile after. 

While this stems from caring about me, I also struggle to accept it because I have abandonment issues from the emotional trauma and I feel guilty about flinching or panicking or whatever happened. And I worry that I’ve done something wrong to make them feel like they can’t be close to me. And I worry that they’ll leave. 

When is the right time to let your partner know you have ptsd? Telling them beforehand seems to make them unnecessarily cautious and distant but I don’t want to be triggered and not have them understand what’s going on. Does anyone have any advice or experience with this?

al78x6,“You just need to start having fun!”: I wish it was that easy for me....,"“You just need to start having fun!”: I wish it was that easy for me....

I am 26 with complex PTSD and borderline personality disorder. Maintaining relationships has been difficult my whole life and let’s just say I am pretty friendless at this time. I push people away, become incredibly dysregulated when feeling rejected or abandoned, and have deep distrust about others. I also feel unlovable most of the time and so when people show me love and care, it often makes me uncomfortable and I back away and reject them.. not helpful to say the least. My therapist and some people from my old group therapy told me I just needed to start having fun. 

While I agree with them I also feel absolute irritation with that comment. While I want to socialize and have fun, often my CPTSD and BPD symptoms get in the way and it is so draining to put myself out there to socialize and go to events when I start having intrusive thoughts, hyper vigilance,anxiety, depression, suspicion, etc.

I feel so trapped and like I’m not living my life to my full potential—-like I’m not working in the career I went to school for because it’s too stressful, I’m not going out to events and concerts, having friends or dating like I’d like to because of mental health. I take lithium to stabilize my moods and kava as well. I will be starting emdr soon... I am also thinking starting medical marijuana... 

Anyways, when people say I just need to have fun, it feels like they are belittling my feelings/experiences and are basically telling me to get over it. I know I need to hand more fun and put myself out there.. and at the same time, I’m struggling to do it because it also harms me by being out there as I’ll often be in fight vs flight hypervigilant mode.

Anyways, what do you all think? Anyone relate?",journey1992,2019-01-29 17:12:56,2,343,17.36,23.31,92.72,21.3,18.05,16.62,92.42,58.89,19.24,14.58,12.54,0.29,0.87,0,0.87,4.66,1.46,13.99,9.33,8.75,11.08,1.17,21.57,5.83,3.21,1.46,0.29,2.04,8.75,4.08,4.37,1.75,0.58,1.17,7.58,0,0.29,0,0,13.12,4.08,1.17,2.33,3.21,0.58,2.33,3.79,0.29,1.17,2.04,2.92,0.29,2.33,0,0,5.54,2.04,0.58,1.17,0.87,0.87,1.75,13.41,2.04,13.12,2.04,4.96,6.41,0.87,2.33,0,0,0,0,1.17,0,0,0.29,0.29,0.58,18.66,8.45,4.37,0.58,0,0.58,0.58,0.29,1.17,2.33,0,0.29

al7yso,I honestly don't know if I can do this anymore,"I don't know what to do anymore. I screwed up my life 3 years ago and lost everything, I tried to get help, therapy, went to the doctors, things got better for a bit and now I'm back to being a miserable waste of space who contributes nothing to society and pretends to be OK all the time. I just screw everything up and do nothing to help myself out of these slumps. I don't even have the balls to kill myself because I couldn't do that to my family and I really don't want to die.

I was tortured by my mother for the first 13 years of my life, it's been discribed as one of the worst child abuse cases that officials involved had heard of. I won't go into detail as I don't want to trigger anybody. I stayed strong for my dad and little brother and kept it all inside, trained to be a nurse. The PTSD got too much for me to handle and I ended up abusing over the counter opiates, got arrested and lost my job and kicked out of my family home. I was clean for a year but have relapsed since then. Currently studying for a master's in software engineering but screwing that up too. 

My credit rating is shit, I've lost a lot of my loved ones, I'm having to take medical leave from my masters and I'm lying to my aunt and uncle about it and about my mental health which is killing me. 

The post is so incoherent sorry, I just needed to vent. I feel like I was so messed up at the start of my life that I can never really recover from it. No matter how hard I try I always end up back in this rut. I'm sleeping all the time, still tired, no motivation, don't care about anything, I feel guilty and I feel this heart wrenching ache all the time too.

ala5yi,Does anyone else experience this?,"Hello, this is my first time posting in this sub but I am experiencing something that I have never really heard mentioned associated with PTSD. Some background, I was diagnosed with Complex PTSD due to a great deal of trauma placed on me by my mother’s long, particularly ugly battle with heroin until her death when I was very young. I live in the suburbs of one of the most dangerous cities in the US. I have been kidnapped, had a gun placed to my head, seen her be sexually assaulted, overdose, had to pull her out of public places while she was overdosing and staff were yelling at me (couldn’t have been more than 8 or 9) to get her out of there, and have had many more awful experiences that have left me with PTSD and attachment issues. I am not currently in therapy because truthfully I can’t afford it. The therapist I did see briefly wanted to see me once a week and although I have insurance the copay wasn’t doable for me so I’m trying to figure something out. Anyway, lately I have been experiencing what I can only call “the call of the void” if you’ve heard that term. Many people use it in terms of the urge to commit suicide, but that is not what I’m referring to. It’s like when you’re driving and for a second that voice in your head is like “what if you just swerved into oncoming traffic rn” or if you’re standing on a bridge over water and the voice in your head says “what if you just dropped all of your belongings down there rn” I have this intense urge to go back to the city that I roamed the streets of and go back to the urban decay and go into the abandoned house my mom died in and I want to walk around and go to the places associated with these memories. I spend a lot of time looking at the neighborhoods I used to frequent on google maps, and every time I see freeway signs pointing toward said city the little voice in my head wants me to just skip wherever I’m going school,work, whatever and drive there. Obviously I don’t do it, but the urge is there and it’s a recent thing and I don’t know why. Is wanting to return to the places where trauma occurred common? Do other people experience this? Looking for some insight from people who deal with what I do.

albtll,An open letter to my abuser...,"(TRIGGER WARNING) this letter does talk about my experiences with physical, emotional and verbal abuse and suicide. please do not read this if you can be easily triggered. I don’t want to hurt anybody, I just want to tell my story and hopefully help people who have or are going through the same thing I have gone through. 


Open Letter To My Abuser. 

To my abuser, 

You have no idea just how much you have screwed up my life. How much pain and torture you have put me through in the relationship and out of it. How it angers me that you get to walk freely, with no consequences or punishments for all of the horrible things you have done and got away with. I have tried so hard to erase the memories of what you did to me from my mind. I have tried to forget what happened, pretend it was all just a nightmare. Yet no matter how hard I try the reality is, you abused me. 
You abused me, my body, my mind, out in public, at your house, in the safety of my own home. You stole so much from me throughout those eight months of torture. My trust in others, the way I look at life, my happiness in life. You stole the two things I have control over. The two things that no matter what storm, no matter what challenge I may face the two things I am always in control of is my body and mind. And you stole that control. You took that from me and for that I hate you. I hate the fact that you took advantage of me and abused me. You made me suffer for so long, you don’t even know how much of what you did to me in that relationship fucked me up. 
After we broke up I tried so hard to numb the pain you inflicted on me. I tried to pretend everything was okay. I thought drinking would quench the thirst I had for the pain to go away. I began recklessly living my life. Jumping into more toxic relationships and hooking up with people I didn’t even like for the hopes of being able to feel something other than the pain I was feeling, I did it in hopes of forgetting about what had happened to me. I was on a downward spiral, my world was spinning out of control and I was losing my grip. 
I bet you didn’t know I tried to kill myself. I wanted to tell you, I wanted you to know what you did to me had pushed me too far. I secretly hoped that if I killed myself and left a suicide note detailed with why I chose to end my life, you would understand that what you did was so incredibly horrible. You would feel remorse or maybe guilt. You would cry to the heavens for forgiveness for the horrible sins you committed. You would blame yourself and beg for a chance to change your actions. I wanted you to know that you were the reason I could bear no longer living. I wanted you to realize what you did.  
I had so much self blame and self hatred, I was driving myself mad. The nightmares and flashbacks of what you did to me played on repeat in my mind. That night I slit my wrists 10 times while downing a bottle of vodka. My attempt was just that an attempt, a failed attempt. I woke up the next morning feeling worse than before. I hated myself for wanting to die and hated myself even more for not being able to successfully kill myself. A few months later after the breakup having to deal with this all I had a choice to make, it was time for me to decide to either live or die. I had to choose whether I wanted to keep fighting or surrender. I knew I was spinning out of control. I knew I couldn’t let this horrible thing ruin my life. I knew I couldn’t let you ruin my life. So I made a decision. I decided I was going to continue fighting. I was going to fight this war and I had to try. I had to keep swimming. Push through the waters and make it to the other side. 
The first thing I had to do was rip the bandaids I had put over my cuts. I had hoped by placing these flimsy bandaids over these deep cut wounds, I could some how forget they were there. Just ignore the blood oozing out of the sides, the pain was still there but it was covered and not nearly as visible to the outside. I had hoped if I smiled through it I would be okay. But now I had to face what happened. I could no longer pretend the damage was not there. I had to take off the mask.
And so as the bandaids were ripped off and the blood began to pour out, all of those memories I tried so hard to forget came flooding back. Your face, the smell of your cologne, the pressure of your grip of your hand as it forcefully grabbed my wrists and threw me to the ground. I had to remember everything you did to me. I had to remember how you would throw me, hit me, slap me, push me, slashed me. How it made me feel, how at the time I felt so much fear and so much pain. I didn’t understand what I did to deserve this treatment when all I did was love you. I loved you so much you have no idea. I would have done anything for you. How I expected you not to hurt me the way you did. I would be crying in pain and you would later realise what you had done, so you would snap out of your rage and come help me up and comfort me as I cried. The bruises you left on my skin eventually faded but I still have the scars you left me from those fights, the one on my left cheek..I had to remember how you would yelled at me, shouted at me, threaten me, curse at me, call me names. All because I did something that upset you, something so small, something that shouldn’t have been taken out of hand for. You would make a big scene about the smallest things and a result in that would be you putting your rage out on me. I remembered how I would believe in your words, how scared and afraid you made me feel. How you would manipulate me, control me, my life, who I was friends with, who I talked too, I know you hated that you couldn’t be with me 24/7 because you weren’t able to control my life more than you wanted. I remember you getting jealous very easily which would lead onto you physically and verbally abusing me. You always needed to know where I was at all times. You needed to have domination and control over me to feel powerful. You would create circular, never ending conversations to confuse and exhaust me, you would hurt me with suicide, threaten it if you didn’t get your way, threaten suicide over me when you felt depressed, send pictures of a knife to your neck, making me believe that you were gonna kill yourself then you would block me on all social media. You would lack empathy for how I felt during these arguments and threats while I would feel the most empathy towards you. I would cry so hard when you would do this to me because I was so scared of losing you. After everything you did to me, I still cared for you and I shouldn’t have!. You would threaten breaking up with me whenever we had a argument to scare me, I remember you doing this to me so you could feel that you were wanted because I would be there begging him to stay. Your behaviour would be unpredictable so I wouldn’t know when you would abuse me next and that would terrify me, anything I did could trigger you into abusing me. When all of this was happening to me I took the abuse on myself by cutting because I felt like all of this was my fault. That I deserved all of this. I am not going to deny that the ways I handled this were not the great. I know I hurt you too. I know I expected a lot out of you, to be there for me when I needed you and to be a good boyfriend, but I never ever did anything like abuse you thought out that relationship. Nobody deserves the type of treatment and disrespect I got. The abuse hasn’t ended, with the posts and songs you make about me saying how much you hate me, wanting me to die, that I killed you inside. All the times you talk about me to other people saying I am a slut and a lier and all the lies you tell them saying it was all my fault and that I am the bad guy and that everything abusive that happened in our relationship was all a lie. You made me afraid to go out in public because if I ever crossed paths with you I know I will be abused all over again. It hasn’t ended, small bits of abuse still carries on today and I wish there was something I could do to stop it but I can’t. I had to remember it all and I had to deal with my monster, my demon… You. I had to choose to try to get through what you did to me. I wish the pain that you caused me could some how be bottled up or liquified so I could put it in a syeringe. I wish I could mail the bottle to you and have you open it just so all the pain that you caused could swarm over you, destroying your life like you did mine. I wish I could take that syeringe and inject it into your veins, flooding your bloodstream with all of the agonizing pain and self hatred you caused me. I wish you could live just one day with the misery I have had to deal with for the past eight months when getting abused and all the months after having to deal with it! I wish you could have to go through what I have had to. 
And yet at the same time I wish you never have to feel the pain I do. I wish that no one you love ever has to go through what I’ve had to. I wish that your younger brother, your Mother and Father, your future wife and kids, I pray they are never abused. I pray that a monster like you, a guy with the same intentions you have never inflicts that hurt on anyone you know or love. I hope I’m the only “victim” of yours. I hope you’ve never abused anyone else or never will. I hope I’m the only one who was unfortunate enough to be involved in your sick and twisted game. I hope no one else has been fucked up at the hands of you. 
You not only fucked over my body but my mind. My soul. You abused my trust in everyone. I fear every guy that I come in contact with. I’m afraid of getting too close, or being alone. You abused my self worth. I feel so ashamed and guilty for what you did to me. I blame myself every single day. I think back to every incident of abuse I encountered with you and wish I could have done more to stop you. You abused my family and friends. Those few I told, those few who know, some did not understand. They blamed me. They too were hurt. Some blamed themselves for not somehow preventing it. And some left because they couldn’t handle the pain I was going through when I would talk about my story. I lost friends because they could never imagine someone like you doing this to me. You did this to me. 
You abused me. You stole so much from me. You have been this horrible devilish monster from the depths of hell that has continued to pull me down. That took my control, that clawed at my heart and soul ripping away at all of the trust and faith I had. You have surrounded me in your burning flames and I was falling into your grip. I was falling further and further down… But now I’m slowly climbing back up. I’m pulling myself out. I’m fighting back. 
You may have done this to me. You may have abused me and hurt me in more ways than words can ever describe. But you will not win. You will not continue to taunt me. I’m fighting back. I’m getting my life back. I hate you for what you did. I will not let you win. I am going to continue fighting this war against you, even if it means I’m fighting alone. 
I know my battle is far from over. I still have a long way to go. I’m going to push through this and fight back. My wounds you caused they are still there but some day they will only be mere scars, and living with scars is much better than not living at all. You have done such a horrible thing and for that I feel so sorry for you. I only hope you can change for the better. Climb your way out of your own hell and be a better person. I’m slowly climbing out of the hell you drug me in and one day I’ll be at the top. One day I’ll be okay again. 
Sincerely, 
your victim no longer",hayleyprice,2019-01-30 03:33:51,1,2354,18.47,52.04,78.96,1,15.69,11.34,95.41,64.74,26.38,20.43,12.96,0.13,6.88,0.04,0.42,5.95,4.16,13.55,10.88,5.23,6.58,2.17,20.73,3.19,1.87,2.25,0.72,2.34,8.75,1.95,6.8,1.1,3.48,1.1,11.51,0.21,0.34,0.08,0.3,15.04,2.76,2.63,4.08,2.46,1.95,2.55,2.59,0.13,0.25,2.08,2.85,0.81,1.57,0.21,0.13,6.37,1.15,1.4,2.63,1.27,0.93,7.69,8.07,1.78,11.68,2.12,5.9,4.08,0.21,0.3,0.13,0.13,0.51,0.59,0.51,0.34,0.04,0.13,0,0,11.38,6.54,3.19,0,0,0,0.08,0,0.08,1.36,0.08,0.04
alf267,I opened up to someone about my PTSD and they told me I was being dramatic.,"I opened up to someone about certain parts of my PTSD, I left out details about some things like hyper vigilance and nightmares because I didn’t feel comfortable discussing the root cause yet. Today I was put in a situation where I felt cornered and my brain was working on overdrive imagining all kinds of dangerous outcomes to a seemingly benign situation. I didn’t have a way out of the situation so I texted the friend I opened up to how I was feeling and that I felt like I was in danger. After the situation was over they dismissed my feelings and told me that I’m usually pretty dramatic. At first I was angry but now I can’t help but think they’re right and I feel like I’m going crazy.

algwys,Delayed response/flashbacks,"**tw:** *threats/potential violence*

Yesterday as I was driving to work, I honked at someone for cutting me off dangerously. They promptly slammed on the breaks, blocked my car in, got out of theirs and started banging on my window holding a knife. 

I mean, that'd be upsetting for anyone I assume. But considering the origins of my PTSD it was especially triggering

However, I was a little shaken up but fine as it happened. I got out of there safely, went to work, was operating fairly normally and then BAM. A half hour into my shift, it hit me. I started having flashbacks and absolutely lost it.  One of the worst episodes I've ever had, and it sure was embarrassing around my coworkers. I felt like a huge idiot, and that I was just being dramatic or something, because it didn't happen until a while after the fact.

Does/has anyone else experience the delay like this sometimes?

alhigx,Just Sharing My Past Trauma of Being Bullied and Domestically Abused,"I have ptsd from being intensively bullied + isolated at school for 10+ years(kindergarten to junior high). I had too much empathy, I was more emotionally mature than the average children, I was shy. In our education system, we are stuck in one classroom and different teachers walk in to teach us different subjects. So I stuck with the same people that bullied me intensely 8 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. The teachers hate me because I was too anxious and miserable to have good grades, they never cared that I was bullied. I didn’t even think anything is wrong, I thought I deserved it for being an incomplete human. This obviously has serious influence on my self esteem, I grew to have severe social anxiety and find it extremely hard to make friends/be in a stable relationship. 

My mother abused me both physically and emotionally at home almost every day(not exaggerated) from since I was in primary school until I was 17. She only stopped because I grew the courage to fought her back with a (TW) very blunt scissor, there was no cut, no blood and all that. (If it’s a sharp scissor I wouldn’t have ever used it) I am also a girl, I weigh 40 kg in my teenage years—now, she weigh 60kg and is taller than me. 

Hitting a child is not illegal in my country so she did it everyday. Every day when she came home from work, I’d hear her complain about work, telling me very loudly that I am a trouble for her, she raised me so I should be grateful, etc. Usually out not no where I’d turn into yelling and hitting. I was so miserable, over the I yelled(basically more of crying than yelling) at her back, I defended for myself and hit her back. But I was so small and skinny I could never win. 

Whenever I was defending for myself, be it yelling back at her or trying to hit her back, she’d pull out her phone, trying to record me, tell me if I don’t stop she’d record me crying and being hysterical, and send it to my teachers and classmates(I was already severely bullied at this point), and I quote, “show them who you truly are”. Because of this I am always confused about whether I am being a brat for defending myself, and thought no matter what I do I’d stuck being miserable, etc. 

My dad never comes home until it was midnight. He was never close to me, I never talked to him. I didn’t know if he knew but I think I had assumed he did and that there’s nothing he could do to stop it. Because I didn’t see it as a form of abuse, it’s my norm, I’d only think I’m unlucky, and I’m supposed to be treated this way because I suck. So the abuse part only happens behind closed doors, between me and my abuser.

I suspect my mother to have borderline personality disorder tendencies. The worst thing is, she is shy and anxious on the outside, and most of the time a people pleaser. So when I finally people she had been abusing me(at 16 I think), people are finding it hard to believe. Including her own father, my grandpa told me there’s no way my mom would hit another person. Over the years some of my relatives sort of accepted the fact but still kept telling me that she’s doing it because she loves me, or trying to convince me that she’s always a loving mom. That hurt me a lot. The trauma still stuck with me to this day and I feel there’s no mean to escape.",nowissnotthetime,2019-01-30 13:08:30,0,641,11.73,23.17,84.1,1,21.37,16.54,92.2,61.15,22.62,17.63,12.64,0.47,0.16,4.06,0.31,4.99,4.06,10.92,11.54,7.49,7.8,3.12,20.9,4.21,1.87,1.09,1.25,2.03,7.96,1.72,6.24,1.4,2.03,1.09,11.08,1.25,0.31,4.06,1.25,12.95,2.65,1.56,1.25,3.12,2.65,3.12,2.18,0.31,1.09,0.78,0.94,0.16,0.16,0,0.31,6.55,1.72,0.94,2.34,0.31,1.56,6.55,9.36,0,13.88,1.4,6.86,6.4,2.18,0,0.78,0,0,0,0.16,0.16,0,0,0,0,16.38,4.52,5.62,0,0,0,0,0.16,0.31,3.12,2.18,0.47
ali937,I think ptsd has sealed my fate,"I suffered from some pretty rough childhood trauma induced by domestic violence and neglect. It’s caused me to get to the point where I can’t trust anybody. I’m so paranoid and I can’t form any real relationships (both dating and just casual friends) because I’m too afraid I’ll be hurt again. I’ve pushed so many people away who hadn’t even hurt me just out of fear of them doing it in the future. 

And if I’m being honest, In a way my trauma has seem to have made me a monster. I’m not gonna blame all my behavior on my trauma because I know I gotta be accountable for what I do, but I feel like the events that happened early in my life have caused me to lack empathy and sympathy and to be a bit desensitized to bad situations/people’s emotions. I’ve admittedly hurt people myself out of fear of being hurt, and I hate myself for it.

aljkkv,I don’t know how to sit with myself.,"I don’t know how to live like this. 
I don’t know how to sit with my horrible feelings and urge to escape. 
I don’t know how to just sit with it. 

My mind is always looking for a way out. 
How can I escape this nightmare. 
How can this be my life. 

I just wanted to come home. 
I didn’t want to be abandoned by my partner and hurt by my mum. 
I didn’t want to be thrown into survival for years. 

I don’t feel real, i don’t know what is real. 
Time doesn’t pass, this place that was once home doesn’t feel familiar 
I don’t have anyone who I feel safe with. 

How do I sit with the feelings when my mind and body want to escape?

I keep thinking of how many pills will I need to just fall asleep like I would every night and not wake in the morning. 

I don’t want to die I just want to feel like a human being that isn’t broken. 

It’s just so unfair.

aljqxm,[TW: sexual assault] How to identify triggers?,"I was diagnosed with ptsd due to a 2 year abusive relationship and then a separate sexual assault (diff person). Sometimes I randomly start feeling angry or irritated by little things, things that usually wouldn’t bother me at all. And I also become hyper-vigilant (scan every room for him), start dissociating eventually, and lights (such as headlights) become VERY bright.  

I can only remember about half of the separate assault, and my ex raped me 3 times while I was unconscious (2 that he admitted to, I woke up during one of them). I feel like not being able to remember a lot of these incidents makes it really hard to identify what triggers me. Some are obvious, like I ran into the guy that assaulted me in a restaurant a few months back, obviously that triggered me. But a lot of the times it’s out of nowhere.   

I just hate not knowing what’s going on with me. Knowing what’s bothering me helps me wrap my head around it and then deal with it quickly, rather than it building up until I explode. Then sometimes I don’t even know what I’m feeling, but I know something is just really ‘off.’ (Does anyone else ever feel like that? Happens a lot.) I had a lot of really great therapy so I feel like I’m very good at handling these things, this is just the one thing I really struggle with.   

How do you identify triggers and then deal with them? Any advice that could help me?",brassysmom14,2019-01-30 16:41:50,6,263,28.51,11.2,99,1.57,16.44,18.25,93.92,60.46,21.67,12.55,10.65,0,0.38,0.76,0.76,9.13,4.56,14.07,7.6,8.75,7.6,1.9,15.21,2.28,2.28,2.28,2.28,3.42,6.08,1.52,4.56,0.76,3.8,0,5.32,0,0.38,0,1.14,22.43,6.84,2.66,1.14,4.94,2.28,5.32,3.42,1.14,0,2.28,2.66,0.38,0.76,1.14,0.38,5.32,1.14,0.38,3.04,0.76,0.38,3.04,9.51,2.28,14.83,1.14,6.08,8.37,0,0.38,0.38,0,0,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,18.63,4.56,3.8,0.38,0,1.52,0,0.38,0.38,3.04,3.8,0.76
alkbm7,"My PTSD stops me from having a healthy relationship with my mom, and she wont try to understand..","I'm 23, I have delt with depression &amp; anxiety as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 18, due to constant yelling for about 8 years of my life, from my parents &amp; sister. I was blocking out every bad memory I could and replaced it with my own happy lies in my head. I was scared to have friends over due to the constant arguments. My mother always made sure I was okay, and wished she could stop it all. My mother was my best friend, now we have no relationship. She doesn't understand how much the arguing affected me, how much it hurts when all those memories I blocked out comes rushing in my head.

Basically anytime someone yells or shouts at me or someone I care about, I react with yelling. I start to shake, my thoughts are not clear, and I defend myself or whomever anyway I can by yelling. Its not like I react to simple loud noises, sirens, nothing like. When someone is talking down to me or someone I love, I become very sensitive to it. Yea so does everyone, which is why its hard for my mother to understand the way I react to yelling.

I've asked my mom to come to therapy and let my therapist explain my triggers, but my mom sits there and just tells my therapist the ways I react a re wrong.  My mom . will get into arguments t hat . a re preventable through understanding PTSD. These result in me being called crazy,  unstable, and that just makes me worse. Mentally I can't process anything.

Im trying to move out . because my mom no longer wants me home. I have no credit so I am being denied, the state housing sign-up is closed. Yet my mother picks at me daily, making me feel worthless.  Which sets off my PTSD. I understand it takes 2 to fix something. 

I'm confused on w hat to do to fix our relationship. Sorry for my grammer, I have a crap keyboard

almpfw,Help...I’m stuck and feeling desperate,"Long story short, or as short as it can be, I was sexually abused from the age of 2 or 3 until I started my cycle around the age of 10. Sexually abused by a family member growing up, never got the help I needed or deserved as a kid or a teen because I was always “just being dramatic”. When I was 19, now I’m almost 30, I said enough is enough and sought out help. I’ve been on meds and going to therapy on and off ever since. I recently opened up for the first time about all of my trauma as a kid to my therapist. After 5 different therapists and never being able to talk about any of it, I told her almost everything. I don’t know why, but I felt like I finally found a therapist I could really open up to about my trauma. Things were going pretty well; all things considered. Then, a bomb landed on me; my mom told my fiancé and I that we had to pack up ourselves as well as our 3 large dogs and our toddler and move out of the house we were renting from her in a matter of a week. She had been planning to sell the house and finally found a buyer to flip the house, but said we had to be out in a week. We had nowhere to go but her house. So, since September of 2018 I’ve been stuck living with this bitter, self centered, hoarding, anxious, fucking mess of a person whom I have never gotten along with. When I was 13, my mom had a severe mental breakdown and never got help. She has gotten worse ever since. In 2014 her codependent died; my dad. So naturally, she still hasn’t gotten help and is now developing what I’m 99% certain is COPD, still won’t go to a Dr. Anyway, I live in a 13x10 room with my fiancé and our 2 large dogs sharing a hallway and bathroom with our toddler who has a room about 10x8 in size. We can’t get approved for a home loan, my only running vehicle is on it’s last leg, and I legitimately cannot get ahead to save my life because everything has to be put on hold now that we are in this situation. Did I mention that in the same week we got evicted my therapist also had to leave the practice and I could no longer see her due to insurance? Yah... awesome. I suffer from PTSD, anxiety, and severe clinical depression as well as CFS and Raynaud syndrome. Can’t have another child, get a house/better vehicle, continue with my plans for nursing that have been put on hold for 6 years now, or function like a normal human being because every single thing that I had to help me has been taken away. It’s easier to stay in my 200sqft of space every day than it is for me to go out into the rest of the 2,500sqft of house that this selfish asshole  that I call my mom has because I’m sick and tired of being constantly nit picked and blamed for things I didn’t do and her making shitty comments to my toddler or under her breath. My child is coming to despise her own grandmother at only 3 years old because she sees what an absolute bitch the woman is. I can’t stand the level of toxicity I have right now. We need to get out of here but are stuck because of shitty credit scores. Every single day I’m backed into a corner and fighting my way out. I am a first responder so my career choice in helping the sick and wounded has not exactly helped my health. I am so lost right now and desperately searching for the light at the end of the tunnel but all I can see is darkness and a tiny speck of light. I’m not suicidal but I do feel stuck and hopeless at the moment with zero motivation.

alpdjj,"First time on reddit, needing some support","Hi, i stumbled across this when trying to google how I'm feeling. 
I got diagnosed with PTSD in 2018 after I was involved in a terror attack. The person is going to trial soon and I have to speak and so I have been feeling pretty emotional about it. I don't know about the rules on this forum regarding triggers, but i generally don't talk about the trauma because i don't want to upset anyone. The scene was incredibly graphic and I can't see any blood on movies anymore without feeling sick and remembering what happened. 

I have been feeling isolated and alone and like my friends arent supporting me. I have deopped hints about being scared about the court case but no one reached out to me. I decided to message a friend and try and talk about how I'm feeling. I said i feel alone and scared about the court date. He told me i need tougher skin and then mocked me and minimised the trial by saying it wasn't like i was snitching on a mobb boss. I immediately started crying and felt so hurt and bad. 

I am sick of the nightmares, sick of the triggers.. I'm sick of needing to wear my noise cancelling headphones and getting overwhelmed in crowds.. I'm sick of being afraid when I'm in the city and feeling like no one understands how i feel. 

When another attack happened in our city, my friend said dont worry, the likelihood of it happening and you being there is low. But here we are. And i have to see that monster in two weeks.

It feels weird asking for words of support from strangers, especially when i don't talk about this with my closest friends. But i just really need to feel supported right now and for someone to tell me it is going to be ok.",Sunshinegal91,2019-01-31 05:21:25,3,321,29.08,20.89,88.96,1,16.05,16.82,93.46,58.57,16.82,12.46,11.21,0.62,0.31,0.31,0,4.36,4.36,15.26,9.66,8.1,10.28,3.43,24.3,4.98,1.87,2.49,1.56,0.93,9.97,1.87,8.1,2.18,0.93,2.18,8.41,0,1.56,0,0.31,14.33,4.98,1.87,1.56,2.8,0.31,2.8,6.54,0.93,1.56,4.05,2.8,0.93,1.87,0,0,6.23,2.49,0.93,1.87,0.62,0.31,5.92,14.02,1.25,11.21,0.93,5.3,4.98,0.31,0.62,0,0,0,0,0.62,0,0.31,0.31,0,0,12.15,6.54,2.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.43,0,0

alqwna,TW: Suicide. I feel like I have PTSD from an attempt and am struggling,"Hi, i’m a 21 year old guy and a uni student in my second year, in my first year of uni i attempted suicide due to how bad everhthing became, i lived in student accomodation and everything was so bad, i was accused of being violent due to being cornered and shaking because they twisted a tweet what I had posted, it was a stupid mistake and was meant in a light tone. I was labeled as violent as I was shaking so much in the corner of the kitchen and ran out, I didn’t hit or touch anyone.
I felt so so unhappy and so low, I barely ate, slept or drank and I rarely left my room.
I attempted suicide because of everything, being labeled as violent/aggressive and having no friends and for feeling so low.
I can remember the blood so much and I used to have flashbacks frequently. 
I am currently in the uni toilets, crying, breaking down because of how they mentioned about PTSD and right now it feels like they don’t understand how it feels to be so weak, broken and to live with no support.
One of the people who cornered me is still in my same class/course and it breaks me so much knowing nothing happened",ggaunted55,2019-01-31 08:01:32,11,230,22.04,21.69,87.24,1,25.56,19.57,90.43,58.26,15.22,11.3,10,0,0,0,1.3,3.91,4.78,12.61,9.13,7.83,14.78,2.17,19.13,4.78,2.61,2.17,1.74,1.3,7.39,0.43,6.96,1.3,2.17,1.74,5.65,0,0.87,0,0.43,11.3,4.35,3.04,0.43,1.74,1.3,1.3,3.04,0.43,0,2.61,3.48,0.87,1.3,0,1.3,5.65,1.3,0.43,3.04,0,0.87,9.13,7.39,0,12.61,0.87,6.52,5.22,1.74,0,0.87,0,0,1.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.87,3.04,5.22,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,1.3,0,0.87
alt8z6,I need help understanding how to treat someone who has PTSD. I live with him.,"I hope this type of post is allowed.

I really need some advice here. I do not have PTSD, but I live with someone who does. I live at home while prepping for grad school. He is my mother's boyfriend. All of us here are very close.

Let me start with that I don't blame him for his struggles. I understand that PTSD (and other mental issues) is incredibly hard to go through. I'm sorry if some of my stress comes through in this post. I care about him and want to help him as well as take care of myself.

You see, he's always struggled and been kind of unstable. But he was a lot better for a while. It wasn't until summer of 2018 that he and my mom went on a trip that things got bad. Some things happened on that trip that built and triggered him to have a crazy PTSD episode (I'm sorry if my terms are not great here, I can't say I understand the disorder that well). The kind where it is extremely vivid and reliving the traumatic experience. Ever since then, he has been not okay and is really stressful to deal with sometimes.

I never know what I'm supposed to be doing. Half the time, I feel like I'm making it worse. I just don't know how I'm supposed to treat him. How much slack to give him, how far to push him, etc. Not really sure how to balance his needs with mine. I know his mental health is his responsibility and that ultimately there is not a lot I can do for him, but it would help everyone involved if I knew how I was supposed to be acting.

Some examples of things he does that affect me:

\- The biggest thing. He does things that scare me. I came home from a trip once and he thought someone was breaking into the house (I told him I was coming home that day at that time) and he rounded the corner with a loaded gun. I admit I totally flipped out at him. Things like that just scare me and I felt unsafe, and still do sometimes because he does things like that. I've talked to him about stuff like this more calmly, and he has apologized and promised me nothing bad would ever happen. He just always feels like he's going to be attacked and needs to defend himself. I trust him, but I have anxiety issues myself and my mind can run away with me. I can't help but feel uncomfortable.

\- Not doing essential tasks (we're on a ranch). I'm talking like not giving the livestock water. When he doesn't do that, I find it later and end up having to do it in the dark or before work when I don't have time, not to mention the animals went a significant period with no water. It's like he starts doing the bare minimum, sometimes not even that. I imagine this has something to do with depression related to his symptoms. I usually do start nagging him when stuff like this happens because I feel like it sucks that he's leaving important tasks to others when he is supposed to do them.

\- Gets extremely negative, so everything that comes out of his mouth is just horrible stuff. It's unbearable to me. I just have to leave because once he starts it does not stop.

\- Victimizes himself. For example, he is struggling to find work right now. He'll talk to me and my mom about it and we will try to offer some solutions. He will come up with a bunch of reasons why the solutions are useless and eventually escalate to yelling at us. I just... I'm not okay with being treated that way.

\- He goes through phases of either wanting to do absolutely nothing or working himself into the ground. It's frustrating because either tasks are not getting done or he is extremely unpleasant to be around because he's stressing himself out so much. He's very black and white, all in or all out, etc. Balance in his life has never been achieved.

\- There is just a general undercurrent of stress and despair that makes me feel really anxious (I do have some anxiety issues of my own) and uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

He sees a therapist, although that is fairly new. We both try to help and support him, but sometimes it feels like a lot. It contributes to my anxiety and makes it hard to focus on my own life. I sympathize with him and I care about him, but I just don't know what do. I've tried to talk to him about it, but I always feel bad because he will say things like he's sorry he bothers me, he doesn't mean to have these problems, etc. All stuff that shows he values himself so little. It becomes a conversation about how I'm bothered rather than about how he is struggling and how we can help.

How much sympathy is appropriate? Is it wrong for me to get frustrated when I know he is struggling mentally? Does telling him off make it worse? How much do I have to bend to offer support so he can work on these things? is it wrong to nag him to do essential tasks given him mental state? Are my expectations too high?

I feel like a ball-buster because I'm constantly managing his behavior trying to prevent things from getting out of control one way or another. I don't want to be a ball-buster, and ultimately I feel like me doing so makes him worse. But what am I supposed to do? Ignore it and let him do whatever he wants at detriment to myself (and probably himself, because he can be self-destructive)?

These are the kinds of questions I have for you guys, who are definitely more experience than myself. I thank you in advance for anything you can offer me.

alttmb,How to deal with interactions with the person who caused your PTSD?,"So my kids dad was my abuser, rapist, and the main root of my PTSD. I left the relationship 8 years ago but I still have major issues dealing with it. I don't trust anyone new unless I meet them through a trusted person. I have panic attacks regularly. I have managed it throughout the years without needing medication or anything else. This past 6 months, my kids dad has been in a custody battle with me and is demanding 50/50 custody and daily contact. My symptoms have progressively gotten severely worse, and I am literally at the point where once I get a text, I am in full panic mode. I can barely get out of  bed to go to work and I am in a full on panic everyday. It doesn't help that every single decision that needs to be made just ends in an argument. 

You guys, I have no idea how to deal with this at all. I feel like I am stepping into a new realm of depression and anxiety I've never experienced before. I can hardly function and it terrifies me. I have an appt with a therapist next week and my BF really wants me to get medication for my anxiety because smoking weed isn't helping anymore and I cry all the time and am in a constant panic.

Does anyone else have to deal with a situation like this where you have no choice but to deal with the person who caused so much pain and sorrow in your life on a ""multiple times a week"" basis. I don't know how I can continue doing this. Each court date and each argument just adds more weight what I already have on my shoulders.",lifesabeachblonde,2019-01-31 12:28:40,7,304,43.17,29.92,91.6,1,17.88,14.47,91.45,57.89,18.09,12.17,10.53,0,1.32,0,0.33,5.92,6.25,13.16,9.54,5.26,7.24,2.63,14.14,3.62,1.64,2.63,1.97,3.29,7.24,0.99,6.25,2.3,1.97,0.99,9.54,0.66,1.32,0,1.32,11.84,1.64,2.96,0.99,1.97,1.64,2.96,1.32,0,0,0.99,3.29,0.33,1.97,0.33,0.66,5.92,1.64,0.33,1.64,1.64,0.99,3.29,13.49,0.33,15.13,0.66,6.25,8.22,0.66,0,0.33,0,0,0,0.33,0,0.33,0,0,0,10.2,5.26,1.97,0,0,0.33,0,0,0.66,1.64,0,0.33
alu2pi,TEIGGER WARNING: SEXUAL ASSAULT. Do I have PTSD?,"I was sexually assaulted by one of my best friends two years ago. It wasn't rape but it was two incidents of him trying to kiss me and touch me after I said no multiple times. I would always end of freezing so he would always get his way. For about four months, we were on and off friends and I would always forgive him after he assaulted me. It took me a while to realize that what he was doing was wrong. I told him I didn't want to talked to him again and to leave me alone. Unfortunately, we are in the same major so I still had classes with him and we were in two musicals together. Plus, he would always still try to talk to me even though I told him not to. I found myself disassociating and having multiple panic attacks that's semester. In one rehearsal, there was a possibility that I would have to dance with him and I had to leave the room because I couldn't breathe. I played it off that I was afraid of heights and didn't feel comfortable being lifted. I luckily didn't have to dance with him. During his last semester, I only took a few classes and I went to an IOP eating disorder clinic. I wasn't eating and I was planning on killing myself. I only saw him twice that semester and everytime  I did, I would have a major panic attack. I luckily haven't seen him since he graduated last semester but ever since he assaulted me, I have been having vivid nightmares every night. My psychiatrist says it might be PTSD and gave me pills for it but I don't know if it is. I do have dreams about him sometimes but not every dream I have is about him. Most of my dreams are about being stalked, killed, or assaulted by someone else. A lot of them have to do with my family abandoning and choosing the side of my assaulter. I never feel well rested. I feel like I could sleep all day and never feel satisfied. The reason I want to figure this out is because I don't want to say I have PTSD if I don't. It isn't fair to the people that actually have it. Thank you if you have read this far.

alurs0,I'm just tired. I know we're all tired.,"I love my partner but it has been an extremely rough 2.5 years. I'm not hopeful it's going to get better. I am bending over backwards to create safe spaces for him and to also have my most basic needs met. He is extremely defensive and he acknowledges it, but we can't talk about anything without it coming back to ""Well yeah, what about you?"" and I don't know how to communicate. We're in counseling and he has made progress in a lot of ways, but I regularly feel like my feelings are getting steamrolled and pushed to the back burner and that any kind of conversation can turn into a conflict because he is so prepped for battle, so to speak. He feels like people are attacking him constantly and the reactions to that end up extending to me.   


I love him because he is beautiful and creative and kind and strong but he is so checked out sometimes and I Know that paranoia and forgetfulness and defensiveness are all classic PTSD, but it's breaking me a part a little bit. Even if I thought a break was healthy, we live together and I'm not sure that would be okay for either of us financially. There's also a part of me that thinks that I've invested so much into this relationship - over 15 years total - that I'm not sure what a life without him would look like. But this isn't working either. I've tried to be explicit and clear and kind about my feelings and he says he hears me but I'm not sure he does or can or if he loves me at all or why.

alva9l,I have CPTSD and I feel like I'm no longer in control of my life,"I was diagnosed with CPTSD (Complex PTSD) which I didn't know existed. My psychologist helped point out that a lot of what I'm experiencing and how I act has become a part of me now because I grew up with constant trauma. Not only that, but the weird thoughts and reactions I have are of my brain trying to stabilize itself now that I've moved out on my own, trying to get used to the fact that I'm not in danger anymore.  


Ever since she pointed that out it gave me a whole new perspective on who I am as a person and why I react and think the way I do. Now that I'm aware of the way that I act almost every day, it makes sense as to why I feel so exhausted and overwhelmed all the time. I'm only 20 and I am already so exhausted and broken and feel like I have no control over who I am or my life. I don't want to be acting the way I do yet it's become apart of who I am so it's instinctive, so I'm now dealing with hating myself every day.   


I'm extremely hypervigilant so I have to be aware of everything that's going on around me at all times, I have to scan the room and all the people in it, I listen closely for every single sound no matter how small even if it's all the way down the street and very faint, I need to know what roommates are in the house at what times and where so I am always actively tracking them and if I am caught off guard I jump and get scared real easily, etc. I feel like I'm being watched most of the time. I always feel like I need to be ready to fight so I need to know what I have around me to use as weapons. I always feel like someones going to get mad at me out of nowhere and start screaming and hitting me just for sitting on the bus, opening the wrong tab on my computer, or slicing cucumbers. If my emotions get too overwhelmed and intense I completely shut down and disassociate to the point that I can't remember anything or anyone's faces and I don't know where I am. The list goes on but I go through this every day and I can't even relax in my own home or get schoolwork done. I feel like therapy is useless and I've had a lot of therapists tell me that they either couldn't help me, that I needed constant long term therapy that I can't afford, or they literally didn't know what to say.

alvqsn,C-PTSD ruined my school life,"(tw, domestic violence) 
Hello, 17 y/o f here, diagnosed with C-PTSD, Bipolar II, and an unspecified dissociative disorder all within the past year. I'm new to this site, so forgive me if I fuck anything up. I also apologize for how long this is going to be. I am/was a senior in high school, and I am supposed to be graduating this June. However, the last semester of this year has been absolutely horrifying. 
From the ages of 13-15, I was abused by two different partners, consecutively. These took forms of emotional, mental, physical, and mostly sexual abuse.  This has left me with serious trauma that didn't impact me until I had a class with my abuser at the beginning of this year. I won't go into the harrowing details, I’m sure you can all imagine the cliche of PTSD- yep, I experienced it. Panic attacks before school, hiding from my abuser in the hallway, dissociating during class, fits of rage, RAPID mood cycling etc... It's not that I didn't expect to see my abuser. I just shoved them out of my mind. 
Paranoia took over, long story short, I fell suicidal again (I was hospitalized my junior year for a major depressive episode and suicidal ideation). 
My counselor offered to change my schedule, but I was way too stubborn, way too ""I am woman, hear me roar"". Plus, changing that class would ruin my schedule, and jeopardize my academics, as this was the first year I was doing superbly (straight A's, as an honors program student). I was even in an honor society and a community service club. I didn't want my abuser to win. I thought I could persevere throughout seeing them every day. It ruined me. I feared for my life almost every time I walked into the classroom. 
I did end up having this abuse reported to the SVU. My therapist (a lovely, intelligent advocate) called CPS, who got the police involved. The police showed up at my house at 9 P.M. in the rain, who took names and facts. I wasn't able to provide them with all my info because I was so foggy and scared. 
The following week, I was pulled out of class to be interviewed by two female cops, SVU, who both were very stern. Not comforting, for the SVU, ESPECIALLY after being notified that I had severe mental health issues. They wore guns on their belts (I have gun PTSD). Never ONCE giving me my rights (saying I had a right to a lawyer, my parents, even my therapist as a MINOR), I sat there shaking, recounting all the trauma my brain allowed (which was not all, but enough to portray illegal actions from my abusers), while the cops gave me stone faces. I gave them photos, messages. At one point, a woman had been talking in the room next door too loudly, and one cop stood, slammed her notes and fists against the wall and yelled at the women to be quiet.
The questions came quickly, and were jarring. I was unmedicated at the time, as well. At this point, I had been rapid cycling for weeks, and the school was working with my severe mental health issues. 
Sitting, re-traumatized, sobbing in the security office of my school (about to vomit) the cops said to me ""Looks like everything was consensual, and there's no way to press charges. Young girls need to understand the difference between pressure and force."" They smiled at me. They pouted at me. ""I'm sorry, honey. If you're ever sad, you should look up this video...""
I blocked them out. I was numb. I was escorted to my counselor's office by my security guard. My counselor gave me a look of helplessness. I asked him to please remove me from my abuser's class, changing my schedule. 
Although I was no longer in my abuser's class, I was now in new classes with unfamiliar people, teachers I did not jive well with, and severe depression post recounting trauma. For a month and a half, the paranoia would completely take over, and I either would be catatonic in bed and would be absent from class, or I would have panic attacks in the halls and would be dismissed early. It came to the point where we had an intervention team meeting with my school and they decided to apply for homebound instruction.

alwbvy,Is this PTSD?,"I have really been struggling since 2012. Around that time where I lived there was many different deaths and suicides of people I grew up with. Neighborhood friends dad got stomach cancer. We watched a thriving happy father turn into a sick man and died quickly after. A girl in the neighborhood over from us hung herself, another girls dad died in a tragic street bike accident on the road near all of us, one of my close friends crashed his car with his girlfriend near his neighborhood and both of them died on impact. It was like the air reeked of death.

This was all capped off when my best buddy got ran over by a drunk driver at 3 am at the beach in May of 2012,  and I was woken up to phone calls from my friends telling me he was gone. I actually was there at the beach the night before, but had come home that Saturday morning for reasons I still can’t even figure out. This is where everything got strange for me. It was almost like I felt it was coming 3 weeks before it happened too. 

My grandparents both died soon after my buddy was killed, and I was in too bad of shape to even go to their funerals, something I regret and feel bad about to this day. 

For 2-3 years I would go up to his grave daily and just hang out there. Many of the friends that I did have stopped contacting me because they could tell that I needed help, but for the longest time I denied it. I reacted angrily after he was killed, people were most likely scared for me and what I was becoming. I used to be this happy energetic dude but after that strange period, I have changed. Nothing pleases me anymore. I used to love snowboarding all winter, but that has gone out the door because I can’t enjoy it without being in my head. I can’t do anything without being in my head, and can’t live in the moment at all anymore. I think constantly about life/death and replay that time period over and over. 

I have nightmares every single night and dream about my friends dad who had stomach cancer as well as my good buddy. I have come to the point where I hate going to sleep because I know I’m going to be in for a ride when I do fall asleep which is usually around 3 am after lying there running through my mind. I now sleep on and off for most of the day dreaming the whole time, and wake up feeling extremely fatigued and basically like garbage. 

I see my doctor on February 16th, because I have finally given in that something is really wrong with me. I appreciate anyone who has made it this far in my post and has any thoughts.

aly4mt,How do I tell my SO that my past is causing severe anxiety about his new job/living situation?,"My SO knows everything that happened to me and has proven time and again that he is faithful, trustworthy and would never hurt me on purpose. He has encouraged me to get counseling, but I’m still working up the courage to go. I know it would help my current situation but frankly it’s still terrifying to me. 

Background is that my ex was a horrible person. A lot of bad things happened and at the end of our relationship he left me for another person who was friend of ours and that he had known since high school. It’s been 5 years and I’m still dealing with it, and probably should have sought help years ago. 

Fast forward to now. My SO got an amazing job 6 hrs away about 3 months ago. Prior to that he had been dealing with depression and a general “who am I” type crisis. This job has brought him back and he is who I remember falling in love with. I am beyond happy for him. The problem is that he is renting a room from and working closely with an old friend of his from high school. A girl I have never spoken to and only heard about from him. There are more than just the two of them in the house (her, him and 2 other guys). To everyone else it’s obvious they are just old friends. But for me it feels like at any moment my world is going to fall apart. That I’m going to wake up and find out he left me for her. Almost like a repeat of the past. 

Everything he says and does proves to me that it’s not going to happen. He drove back one night just to spend 12 hours with me. But there is a part of me that is living in terror every day and I don’t know how to tell him.

i think it was three boys. my mind keeps wanting me to believe i know who one of them was (i'll call him john, for the sake of convenience). if my memory is right, then that would mean john forced me to perform fellatio on him while i was held to a desk by 2 other boys.

alzcrj,"Multiple cases of PTSD I believe, as well as depression and looking for a workbook/advice","I'll try and keep this as short as I can and only include the necessary information to explain where I'm coming from.

(EDIT: This ended up longer than I thought, I apologize.)

&amp;#x200B;

I believe there was sexual abuse when I was very young, I have blocked out a part of the event and need to go under hypnotism or some other form of therapy to know for sure. 

I was mistreated half of the time in grade school because I was cute but vulnerable as I was kind, positive, honest and sheltered. I was raised by women, an artsy guy everyone ""liked"" and liked to talk about behind my back, called gay and lost all my friends due to a few spreading rumors being...jealous because I was good with women when I was young? I don't know, perhaps as well an easy target because I was wearing tight pants when they were ""gay"" ha. 

Went to a state school and returned a semester later because I just drank and smoked pot (Great fun while I was there). I've been living with chronic depression since, brought on my trauma (Read further) and-I don't think so, but possibly-marijuana or very sparingly ecstasy/lsd use after state school (Though I value the lessons in perspective they have taught me). Chronic depression has been for 13 years (Since 19, I'm 32 now). 

Went to commercial art school a couple of years later to make the most out of my passion. After school, I worked for a narcissist who gaslighted me and berated me on everything from the way I speak and walk to my sexual orientation (Straight, but nothing against those who are gay, just those who use it in a negative way). Very little of it WAS helpful as it's hard to see yourself and I never had a steady father figure, but 95% of it was a push/pull at getting me to devalue myself. Yelling at me and demeaning me in front of important clients when I was doing good work for him, until I almost completely broke (This was for 70-75 hrs/wk for 7 months). Besides retreating from that, I decided against my profession if 150-300k a year meant giving my life up and a potential family for it.

Then I lived with my father for a year (who I met at 14) but our second attempt at a relationship fell flat (Mostly kind, but completely an ""out of it"" alcoholic). I haven't really talked to him much since and that half of the family is berating me for being ""difficult"" for not accepting his behavior. He doesn't even remember conversations. I had to walk away from those I love (That half of the family) because I couldn't take more judgement and criticism in my life.

I have a mother who is kind (Doesn't put me down, but can never see herself as being wrong) who I moved in with a year later to heal and start a new business. It was always just the two of us while I was growing up, other than see her try a marriage to a guy who turned to a control freak, who hit her. My residence was shared with my stepfather who she had been married to for 6 years (different guy). He was nice to her then flipped into a narcissist, berating her and me. She didn't tell me everything until fairly recently, but I knew he was physically violent to her a few times and constantly emotionally abusive to the both of us . We helped him grow close to his family after alcoholic abuse to them and he lied to them about us, turning them against us for a total of 13 years. This finally ended (living with them for 5 years) because he was physical with me recently and we got a civil protection order to get him out of the house. They are about to get a divorce (Thank god), but I lived in it so long and had to take it from him and smile so he wouldn't kick me out, because I didn't feel comfortable leaving him alone with my mother.  My mother didn't leave because she would have been financially screwed at her older age as she let the times of physical abuse (and pressing charges) slip by, thinking he would change. She was just waiting for one of us to get hurt to make it work.

\- - - - -

So here we are. I don't have the greatest confidence (To say the least) and I've read that people should self-soothe after PTSD. Though, I've always been very critical of myself. I was egotistic for a couple years after high school and I have battled with seeing the difference between confidence and egotism since dropping it. I see it as egotism means putting other down to inflate false-selves and confidence as being sure in your true strengths AND knowing your weaknesses. Though I can't seem to be confident without feeling like I'm not being humble and I fear self-soothing will lead to ego. I also don't want to blind myself from negative truths. I try to always question myself before others and I still think that it's a good practice. Though, I've only felt like I've truly known myself, inside and out-for the most part-for a couple of years. I always try to be the best person I can. Though, it feels more and more and more like I just can't go anymore. It feels like I'm 60 in terms of the the stress I've dealt with in my life. Though, I'm sure there are those that have it much, much worse around the world. I'm trying to find a career with purpose (Self-business has shaky future because of industry) where I make the world a better place. While I'm fine with giving my life for others, it probably means becoming a firefighter and dying at age 40-60 due to health risks in that profession. That, or at I.T. job in a cubicle for the rest of my life. I'm trying to learn from all the unhappy lives and circumstances I've seen in my life, not to make the same mistake. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Is there a clearer way to see confidence/egotism? Confidence while being humble? I've lost my friends, not because of who I am or how I treat others, but because I've lost confidence and they've lost respect for me because of that.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Is there a really good workbook for any of this?

&amp;#x200B;

\*I plan on seeing a therapist again. I saw one at 19, but he didn't agree with bringing up past blocked memories. He just said to stop smoking pot. While I have taken breaks and know I don't need to to be happy, it has always been my self-medication for depression and I rarely drink. It is my outlet, but solo as I'm anxious when intoxicated in public (Brings out insecurities or negative feelings I'm feeling). I completely dropped anti-depressants 9 years ago and feel better and better compared to when I was taking them. There are different types of depression, medicines treat some symptoms of some, but creates really exasperated feelings of suicide in depressed people for the first and last two weeks on/off the medication). I've tried a couple (Wellbutrin/Prozac) and stopped due to those side effects and a feeling of emotional numbness.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only do I not find joy in everything but some in sex/masturbation/pot/video games (Sex addiction perhaps as well), but I am really running low in my RESERVES of will.

I have been on countless meds over the years: the current cocktail is Prozac, Xanax, and hydroxyzine. However, talking with my doctor as well as the counselor who has worked with me, we have determined that medical cannabis would be a beneficial treatment to try. How many of you folks use cannabis medicinally for PTSD and, in your personal experience, how has it worked out in coping with PTSD. The frustrating thing to me is that SSRIs, benzos, and all the other pharmaceutical crap KINDA works, but not that much, and then ceases to work and have to increase the dose, or else switch medications (my SSRI before Prozac was Zoloft). I have heard that using medical cannabis for PTSD is a far more effective option, so I would love to hear feedback from you all.

am0gfu,Could this be ptsd? [Possible trigger warning],"Last night I had two nightmares that woke me up in a panic. One was about wanting to go meet a lifetime bestfriend but not being able to because in the dream I was having a panic attack. (He ditched me last year after seeing each other every single day for 4 years straight. When he left it was very traumatic because he turned on me and became a bully. I had no friends other than him and he took advantage of that) And one was about me badly beating up a bully from years ago. Both dreams were very vivid. I've been getting bad anxiety ever since October after my grandma died. When I was 13 my anxiety started after a baby died in the family so could there be a connection there? 
I've been told by docs that I have GAD and panic disorder but have never had dreams that have woken me up before.
I apologise if any of you read this and take offense. I know ptsd is no joke. It could, and more than likely is just my anxiety acting up but I just want to know if any of you feel this could possibly be ptsd

am1v38,How do you deal when no one in your family believes your trauma history?,"I was severely physically, emotionally, and sexually abused by my father in my early childhood, along with certain other relatives abusing me in emotional and sexual ways. I've expressed what has happened to me but I find no one can believe me. I don't blame them, it's difficult to see loved ones capable of such terrible acts of atrocity. 

But I find it's really contributing to my isolation. I feel ashamed of myself for having these dark, terrible secrets. I know it's not my fault, I was only 2-6 years old when much of the abuse took place. But I find myself compulsively isolating, feeling the need to be away from everyone; allowing others to live in their fairy-tales where nothing is wrong, all the while I have had to suffer daily for years because the adults in my life didn't know how to take care of their child properly.

It just seems like some horrible stuff that happened a long time ago and which is the likely explanation for me turning me into a weirdo hermit. 

My therapist says that I have just disassociated myself from the trauma and that all the stress is stored in my body. Now she wants me to have EMDR therapy which will cost me an extra 50% per session. From what I've read about EMDR I'm wondering how it would even work for someone without vivid memories or emotions.

When I read my therapist's CV I can see that PTSD is her specialist subject and that she has recently learned how to administer EMDR. She is a very well qualified and established professional so I don't think she is exactly scamming me, but I can't help but wonder if it might be a case of a person with a hammer thinking everything looks like a nail.",fitzswackhammer,2019-02-01 10:29:19,2,212,13.61,7.86,69.48,8.74,19.27,18.4,88.21,60.85,21.7,14.15,11.79,0,0,2.36,0,7.55,6.13,9.43,12.74,7.08,7.55,2.83,20.28,1.42,1.42,3.3,0.47,2.83,4.25,0.94,2.36,0.94,0,0,5.19,0,0,2.36,0,18.4,6.13,1.42,1.42,5.66,2.83,4.72,2.83,1.89,0.47,0,2.83,0.47,2.36,0,0,1.89,0.94,0.47,0.47,0,0.47,2.83,16.51,1.42,5.19,0,2.36,2.83,3.77,0,0,0.47,0,0,0.47,0,0,0,0.47,0,11.32,4.25,1.89,0,0,0.94,0,0,0,3.77,0,0.47

am7k91,"Talking will help, but I'm going to hate it. (potential trigger?)","Long time listener, relatively first time caller. 

I fucking hate this. It's been over four years since the last event, and I did all the work, did all the therapy, even did some medicine for it. Stress from a job flared up some anxiety, and now all these old issues come tumbling back. I did all the work on talking about the events, all the EMDR, all the hard work where you're so wiped out you just get home and cry and sleep for 12 hours. 

But I never realized that that was the only trauma. There was the grooming, the lesser events that didn't get nearly as violent but were just as mentally damaging. And now I'm in a wonderful job, surrounded by good people, and I'm sneaking out for cigarettes to bring the anxiety down. 

I'm going to have to talk about these things. I've never said them out loud in a straight line, described the event, described my fear, described the physical reality of what I experienced, and now it just rattles around my brain. There's crying, there's vomiting, there's more crying, and there's just a twitchy edginess about everything. 

There's therapy next week, and I'm just so crushed by the fact that this is back. It will always be a part of my life, and that's fucking depressing enough. I didn't deserve this, and they don't deserve to get away with it. The cases are still open, technically still under investigation, but I know the harsh reality of whether or not that will go anywhere. That part doesn't even matter. There's just the anxiety with a thin layer of anger on top of it. I'm so fucking angry that people are so selfish, that they can cause this much damage that's so far reaching. I just hate this feeling and I'm so so sad to have to do this again. It'll be worth it once the work is done and time can get in there and heal things for me, but the grief I feel for myself is staggering.

am953z,A bunch of little things,"As far as directly triggering things, life has been semi smooth recently. I started back up at school and that’s been hard but getting thru initially. But the last like 2 weeks I have had so many like just common life circumstances all happen at one and has cause me to spiral so fast and have panic attack after attack. I was able to pick my self up for a few days but my goals of getting work done today were not met and I ended up spending almost all day in bed. I am trying to be self positive and saying that I must have needed this time but as deadlines and exams dates get closer I just can’t help but feel insufficient. Like I am not capable a facing “normal” life. Teachers and friends just keep saying things like “oh well your computer breaking just happens sometimes” and “falling down the stairs and spraining your ankle is just a bad day” and having to pick your self up and play fun best friend to a girl turning 21 in New York City “should be an amazing time” and having debilitating stomach pain when eating almost anything just sucks. I know all these things are true but I feel like all these people would handle it without feeling bedridden and self harming. Im really not feeling sorry for myself about any of these things happening either because I can recognize that it’s “just life”.

amaho9,"After some very scary things happening, I am afraid when my partner goes on dates with others (in a polyamorous relationship) for his safety, and I don’t know how to deal with it (tw for sexual assault)","Hi everyone

(tw for sexual abuse of different sorts, not graphic)
((when responding please give me a trigger warning if you’re going to discuss anything in detail along the lines of what this post is about if you can. thank you so much))


I am posting because I don’t know who else to possibly ask this question. A few days ago I found out these past few months my partner has gotten into some extremely unsafe situations under the influence and has been sexually assaulted and raped. It is really hard for me to say that and I probably won’t say it throughout this post but I think I need to be honest to ask for advice.

But. The person who did that to him is making a very difficult situation for him currently, and that is the only reason he told me. All I knew is suddenly he was more jittery and jumpy and had this crying spell, totally sobbing, when i’ve known him for years and he usually can’t cry even if he wants to.

He told me about this and I loved the poly part of our relationship before; he’s been seeing a girl who sounds really nice, and I’m seeing a girl who I really like as well; the problem is now I am extremely scared when he is going out on dates. I have sexual trauma from my childhood and I didn’t know for months this happened to him, and I am terrified that he will get into a situation where he won’t know how to say no or can’t, and it will happen again. I truly want to stress this is not possessiveness - it’s just this is deeply disturbing me and it’s not about me but all I can think is that now he understands what it feels like to have that sort of trauma and I never ever wanted him to be able to understand that. It makes me sick to think I could be sitting here and something like that could be happening again and I’m freaking out. Because he’s somewhat in denial sometimes or blames himself, and I’m scared he’ll get in that place and be invalidating himself again and not protect himself as much as he would if he acknowledged that even though he’s male this can happen to him too. Im worried someone will coerce him or hurt him and I can’t stop thinking about the person who hurt him and how it happened. I wasnt there so I don’t know but I imagine it in terms of what happened to me and I can’t think. I can’t focus on anything, I feel just constantly on edge and paranoid of everyone. I just thought he was safe, and this is the sort of thing that happens to me, not him.

I know it’s paranoia, and I trust him, but I don’t trust others right now. I love him so much and I want to protect him but our relationship is so lovely the way it was, and I don’t want to ask him if we could close it because it’s something he loves too, being able to explore and share our experiences and meet new people. Especially because it doesn’t make sense that it almost feels like for some reason I’m more scared for him than he is for himself. I think he is in a bit of denial and taking a while to process the trauma, but I cannot stop thinking about how I didn’t see the signs and didn’t know and didn’t try to help him, and I feel like not checking on him something may be happening to him... but that’s possessive, and I want him to be able to have a good time with others. Especially after what happened, I don’t want him to end up scared of others like I mostly am (which is a large reason why we are open - so I can be less afraid of other people and learn how to branch out more).

So I am wondering if anyone ever had a partner who experienced anything like this, or if they had experience with this, and if anyone could give any advice on how to get rid of this paranoia or how to properly deal with it while letting the both of us have the sort of relationship that makes us happy. Thank you so much for reading if you did. If anyone has any suggestions for somewhere else I could post this where they might know more, please let me know.",throwaway95848482823,2019-02-01 19:57:20,4,799,5.74,39.14,46,4.94,30.73,12.39,96.5,67.71,24.53,14.89,7.76,0.88,0.63,5.38,0.25,9.51,3.13,12.89,11.76,8.26,11.01,3.5,21.53,4.26,2.5,3.13,0,2.75,6.76,2.38,4.38,1.75,0.63,0.63,13.77,0,0.38,0.25,5.63,20.65,4.51,2.63,3.13,5.88,1.63,6.63,2.5,0.5,0.5,0.88,1.13,0,0.13,0.63,0,6.13,2.63,0.5,0.88,0.75,1.5,3.5,16.15,1.38,10.01,0.5,4.13,5.01,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0.13,0,0,0.13,0,12.52,3.38,3,0,0.25,0,0,0.25,0,4.13,1.5,0
amalsk,Tired Of Being Angry,"In the early stages of my PTSD, anger was just beginning to develop. I would have small bouts of rage, enough to be abnormal, but not enough to control my life. Now, my anger is becoming all consuming, to the point where I feel like it’s changing my personality. I’m irritable, on edge, aggressive, and defensive. It’s like I’ve completely hardened. I never had been this way. I’d always been one to forgive and forget. I was patient once. Anger was something I rarely, if ever, experienced. Now, it’s part of my every day life. If I even experience a trigger for a split second, you can bet that I’m cussing and yelling the next. I’ve always been good at hiding my symptoms, but it’s becoming more and more difficult. I don’t want to hurt anyone, nor myself. It’s exhausting. Sometimes, I’ll get so angry that I’ll find myself furrowing my brows, clenching my teeth, tensing my shoulders and tightening my fists unwittingly. It leaves me with a lot of physical symptoms like headaches or knots. I just want to breath a little. Let my guard down. I just don’t know how.

amg7oo,(22F)Continuing to feel if I wasn’t here anymore it would be beneficial to everyone around me.,"I’ve been dealing with a lot of issues since I was a little kid. I grew up with an physical and emotional abuser as a step parent who made my life a living hell. My father never did anything about any of the things she would do to me and numerous times I went to him telling him she was hurting me or she said something really upsetting and he would either tell me it didn’t happen or he would just tell me that he’d leave her one day. Leaving this little piece of hope in me but he didn’t end up leaving her until I was already almost 18. This went on from age 4 until I was 18-19 because after they divorced and he moved out she literally went out of her way to move into his new building and get the apartment right next to his. Trying to get everyone in the building to hate the both of us. 

Ever since I was little I always felt like the odd one out that just didn’t belong. I had two older brother who were 10 and 12 years older than me. By the time I was three my parents divorced. My brothers both had relationships with my dad that I would never have. Not to add they were so much older than me that it was hard to connect with them. Since I was little I never felt important or of value. My mother was the only family member I had that I felt I could trust but it didn’t make any of the pain my father inflicted any easier. Literally everyone in his eyes was more important than me. The relationship my brothers had with him I never had. Then when he married my step mother she had three grandchildren who he took on as his own. He would take them everywhere and go to all of their sports events and school stuff. He never went to anything for me at all not even showed interest in any of the good things I did. It was like everyone else on the planet would always be better and I just wouldn’t be shit. 

Growing up with all of that and just all of the terrible things my stepmother put into my head at a young age has made me have quite a few issues. When I was little she would always put me down. Mind you when she came into my life I was 4 so I didn’t have much power over my situation or really any way at all to stick up for myself. She would insult almost everything I wore to make me feel like I was a freak. She would tell me how ugly I was and how I was fat (which might I add I’ve never in the eyes of others been fat). She would tell me I dressed like a whore and that I would never amount to anything. She would tell me that my mother didn’t really love me and that she was just using me as a way to get money out of my father. She told me this all throughout my life and although I knew it wasn’t true I started to believe it.
I had always struggled with my self esteem and have always hated myself for as long as I could remember. I felt like there must be something wrong with me that my dad never showed all to much interest in me and that the things my stepmother did happened. When I made it to middle school I attempted suicide for the first time. I tried to hang myself with a belt in my closet with the doors closed. The belt broke and I felt even more pathetic from that point on. I started not to eat as much when I was in middle school and whatever I did eat I’d force myself to throw it up. This went on for a few years on and off with the severity until I was about 16-17.

I had gotten into a serious relationship for the first time and felt like I’d finally found happiness. Just to find out that my boyfriend at the time had a mother and a sister that didn’t like me from the start. I didn’t come from money and for that reason I wasn’t good enough for him in their eyes. I was with him for a little bit under 3 years and the bulimia came back after about a year into the relationship with him. I didn’t share my true self with him until after a year. I started opening up and having panic attacks in front of him instead of constantly holding in my feelings. He didn’t really know how to handle it and most times would end up getting angry at me for just not being normal. This added to me continuing to feel like an outsider and a waste. He ended the relationship with the typical “it’s not you it’s me” bullshit which I knew meant it was me.

After we broke up I had got with my best friend who I had feeling for since before I met my previous boyfriend but he had a girlfriend at the time so I never pursued it. We ended up telling each other that we always had feelings for each other and have been together since 2015. His family took me in like their own and it felt so wonderful. I finally felt like I was going to be happy for once in my life. He accepted me fully for who I was and for all of my mental problems. He’s come to counseling with me and always has been super supportive and patient with me. He’s seen every side of me and never left and I’m grateful for that.

But as of recently his brother has caused some problems. For the past three years I’ve been with my boyfriend his brother has always had things to say about me to my boyfriend. Since we are so close we literally tell each other everything so he told me the things his brother had said about me. Each time it pissed me off but I never addressed it to his brother because I didn’t want issues with his family. I’ve lived that hell before and didn’t want to experience it again. Back in September his brother posted a side by side picture of me and my boyfriends ex girlfriend next to each other trying to compare us as a joke. Now our group of friends has always been about joking with each other but I just felt that was too much and initially overreacted to the picture. Mostly because of all of the things I knew his brother had said about me prior. He made a comment to my boyfriend making fun of me saying something along the lines how I was a crazy person and how it’s such a great idea for a crazy person to help crazy people. Seeing as I’m seeking a profession in social work it was just really insulting and hurtful. His brother then sent me a long message apologizing for what he said about me being crazy but it wasn’t really an apology. More like a backhanded one. I had gone to his wife about it because we were friends. I talked to her about how I was really upset and having panic attacks over the situation. Then not to long after his brother had messaged me pretty much making fun of me for saying I had a panic attack. So I waited a day to respond mainly because I was infuriated and didn’t want to respond aggressively. I wrote out my response explaining myself completely and telling him some personal stuff about me to help him understand where I was coming from and to explain why I had the panic attacks he was making fun of me for. He pretty much told me he didn’t care about me or what I “claimed to have” ( even though I’m diagnosed and have been for years with severe ptsd and anxiety). He told me that I was using my mental health as an excuse to be a shitty person and since then has made my life a living hell. He wants to be told that he’s right and won’t take ownership to his actions. He has involved my boyfriend and his parents and it’s awful. His mother is very sick with a rare auto immune disease and he’s telling her she has picked sides with me and now won’t even call her mom. I attempted to message his wife to have us all meet up and attempt to resolve it but in response I got “ we all have much better throngs to do then get the guilt off your back. Sorry mommy and daddy didn’t love you enough and that because of that you like to use your mental health as an excuse to overreact”. Then his brother fought with me after for most of the day telling me everything was all my fault and that he’s open to working things out with his brother but wants nothing to do with me. 

This situation has gotten so out of hand and I feel responsible even though I know it’s not my fault. I wish I would have never reacted because the pain it’s causing my boyfriend and his family is killing me. Every time something new happens with this it just feels like the knife is going deeper and I’m really just losing hope. I’ve been suicidal for a very long time and it’s constantly in the back of my head. I try to deal with it but most times it’s unbearable. I just feel that if I was gone everything would be better for everyone else. My boyfriend could be successful with his dreams and not have such a burden attached to him. He could find someone who was on the same level as him and could grow more with him. I feel like if I was gone his family could be together again and no one would have to be hurting. And I feel like it’d just be better if I was gone. I constantly feel like a burden on everyone around me and I just wish I could disappear.

amhjdc,How to support friend with PTSD during trauma anniversary,"I hope it's ok for me to post here. This girl and I have been very close friends for a few years, and she has PTSD. She didn't tell me any details about her trauma, all I know is that it's from sexual assault. February is a hard month for her, because she's reminded of it more than usual as it's the anniversary month.

I really, really want to help her, but it's hard because we're far (she's an online friend). She's been venting online the past two days, and saying some concerning things clearly related to trauma, but whenever I offer to listen to her she doesn't even reply to me - she barely ever does, because she says that she feels like a burden, even if I told her over and over that she isn't, because ""I already have enough problems"" so she doesn't want to overwhelm me with hers. She can't afford therapy and never had any treatment, she's severely burnt out from work, and since we recently confessed to each other but don't know if we actually want to start a ldr, she's been stressed out by doubting her feelings too. It's a very hard time for her.

I also deal with trauma, but I deal with it completely differently (I have access to therapy and a few other conditions so it's a whole different situation), and since it was an ongoing trauma, I have no anniversaries. I don't know how any of this works. Is there a way to support her? Or is it better to let her process her feelings alone?

amhn8e,Family with a very negative view of medication.,"I fought my PTSD without medication for years pre and post diagnoses but after starting a full time Master's Degree this year along with full time work and a few other personal life stressors my anxiety just got the better of me and I was finding it difficult to function. I ended up screwing up my degree and am having to take a leave of absence and I am recommending the degree from the start part time in September. This means it's going to take 3 years longer than it should but I really think its the best thing for me. 

I've been agonising over telling my aunt about the leave of absence. I had a bit of a breakdown three years ago, got arrested, lost my job and registration as a nurse and basically just completely screwed my life. My dad and his wife kicked me out of the house, I didn't make life at home difficult and helped out as much as I could but my dad's wife was just waiting for a reason to get rid of me and my brother. I was very fortunate to have my aunt who took me in, looked after me, provided for me and got me back into education.

The only problem with her is that she doesn't believe in mental health problems and always states that ""they weren't a thing 20 years ago"" etc. She was always getting at me about the PTSD saying I need to learn to get over things and draw a line in the sand. She even asked me if I was in therapy for attention.

My housemate is on sertraline my aunt was asking how he is getting on and she basically said she couldn't understand why he was on it and I told her he had really bad anxiety and she said ""anxiety? What even is that? We didn't have any of those things 20 years ago. He needs to just get on with it. A man his age should know how. He's going to be destroying his brain and he'll be on it for the rest of his life. I just don't understand that.""

The thing is I finally had the nerve to go to the docs about my issues and started on propranolol and sertraline and I was trying to figure out how to tell my aunt about it along with the leave of absence. I don't really know what to do. I'm supposed to graduate and get a job relevant to my degree this summer and I don't really see a way around telling her but it's going to cause a complete blow out and things have been really good with her lately. She won't understand it. It's difficult for me to get a good job with the conviction and the degree was a way around that. I have my own house but I go home at the weekends and work at my aunt and uncles business (I'm trying to get another job) and I think she'll panic thinking I'm going to be relying on them forever. It might not be so bad if I get another job. Does anyone have any advice in regards to this? I would really appreciate it.

amji6i,Sudden Flood of Good Memories,"Hi all. I am not a follower of this sub, but I have PTSD and  I just had a profound and overwhelming moment that was incredibly positive, so I just wanted to share it with you to show that things can get better and there is the possibility of a brighter future.

A bit of background of my experience. I had a pretty rough time at school and with my family, which had a negative effect on me. I ended up working in commissioning at our local hospital and I think I got swine flu and was just not right for a year or so until I had a chest infection that wouldn't quit and started catastrophising my job, all coming together into  a huge breakdown.

This left me bed ridden with severe anxiety, chronic fatigue, pain and the most bizarre constellation of symptoms, including stammer, ticks, altered gate, hypersensitivity, involuntary movements and a lot more. I was in a wheelchair for a lot of my 20s and on crutches with altered gait for the rest. I barely went out or did anything.

I had numerous attempts of doctors and psychologists tried to help, Identify and pin down what was wrong with me, I kept shrugging them off and refusing to believe it was anything to do with my mind, or they just didn't know or want to. It was a very bleak time. 

Finally, I had one last go at it and I was lucky enough to see a fantastic therapist who used CBT and EMDR to help me process the memories of school. It was rough, but ultimately it changed my life dramatically. I could walk and talk, losing all my anxiety and bizarre symptoms. I still have the fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, but it was a whole world of difference.

I did have another breakdown a while later, but managed to see the therapist again, and this time sort the family stuff out, which has left me so much happier and able to have a relationship with them as an adult.

Anyways, to today.

It's been a year and a bit since I last saw my therapist. I am happier now than I have ever been in my life. I still get overwhelmed with my conditions, but now I know it's okay to have feelings, and I am free of the weight that ground me down all my life.

Tonight, I had a bath and sang along to two albums that were so tied to the bad times, but albums I do so enjoy (Out of Bounds by No Fun At All &amp; Americana by The Offspring). I sang along with every word and I was suddenly inundated with all these happy memories and good times that had become so buried by all the bad and traumatic ones. A whole, overwhelming flood of good times and friends from a childhood and adolescence that had only been pain and discomfort before. I absolutely sobbed my heart out, and not for the first time in the bath, but this time it was pure joy. It was indescribable and such a gift to have the positive memories back and to be able to cope with the processed negative ones alongside them.

I think I just wanted to share this because it was so profoundly positive and I wanted to give hope to anyone in the dark and cold because I know reading this would have buoyed me a little when I was adrift.

I have so much love for all of you suffering with PTSD or family, friends or partners effected and trying to help. I send you all positive vibes and truly hope things get better and you can have a moment like this because it can get better and things can help.

Apologies for the long and rambling post, I just wanted to share some good that has come after struggling with PTSD.

TLDR: I had a big happy cry in the bath and remembered some good times from my past, which was overshadowed by the bad times for so long while getting my 00's punk on, and things can get better.

amk0uy,[TW] Need some support,"Hey Reddit,

I really need some support right now.

Here are some things that have happened in the last 2 years:

&amp;#x200B;

* I got drugged and gang raped by strangers
* A university lecturer locked me in his office with him and threatened me
* My ex-boyfriend tried to murder me
* That same ex who I was in an absuive relationship for 5 years with has been harrassing / stalking me continuously since we broke up 4 years ago
* My dad died
* A guy on my university course spiked my drink with ketamine and sexually assulted me

Most of the time, I can handle it. But right now, I feel really overwhelemed.

I have a mountain of work to do, and I am worried about letting my teachers down when they have been so supportive and kind to me. 

I feel like a massive idiot for not being more on top of my work. Even though it feels like i'm working flat out most of the time.

My family mostly pretend that nothing has happened, and that I don't have ptsd. 

My boyfriend has been genuinly amazing. But he lives an hour away and I feel like i've already been really whiney about this stuff with him.

&amp;#x200B;

It's almost impossible to explain to anyone what it's like to try and study or do anything really when the flashbacks are so intense.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know why i'm posting. Just that I desperately feel like I need a little bit more help to keep going.

When he was old enough to walk but still very young my mother went out with friends and my brother cried alot. My dad recorded my brother crying and played it back to him while chasing him around the room(my sister and I chased him too). I was also involved in psychologal abuse with my father toward my brother by scaring him when he was trying to go to sleep at night( I would have been 10ish I think). He involved my sister and I in other ways but being the first born, I knew I *needed* to participate, so I was more involved. 

We were all forced in to counseling at one point and my sister told my mom a little of what happened and we're not sure if she believed it or not. I don't think my mom has ever talked to my brother about it because she seems to have a sort of mental block stopping her from accepting or denying information about physical abuse. My ssiblings are all very close now. My sister and I remember everything(we think) but my brother has never talked about remembering any of it (except scaring him at night, but the memory seemed vague - we told him what happened and apologized). 

I have been diagnosed with ptsd and I suspect my sister would too if she could find a decent doctor. We both had a really hard time in highschool and mental illness has taken us for a hell of a ride.

My brother on the other hand seems pretty well adjusted. He went through highschool without any problems, when he gets jobs he keeps them and says they aren't very stressful, he makes amazing art and makes his own furniture. He used to have some weight issues years ago but he took it upon himself to start lifting weights and seems pretty happy with the results. He also used to be kind of a dick but he responded to feedback really quickly and has become an amazing person.
 He is *very weird*, he was a weird guy in highschool and he's a weird guy now(in a good way). He seems very confident in hismelf and doesn't seem to compromise his individuality for anyone. He's pretty much the same guy to everyone he meets (to a reasonable extent). He made most of his friends online at first but now he's got friends at work and a gf. All my friends love him and like that he doesn't really care what people think about him.

My sister and I are so proud of him and are pretty surprised that he adapted to normal life so well considering he got the brunt of the abuse.

We wonder how much he remembers though. We all still talk to our dad and my brother handmade him a gift this xmas. He's never seemed mad at our dad and doesn't talk about him the same way as my sister and I do. I always keep an eye out incase my brother shows any signs that he's upset/depressed/traumatized and the only thing is that he has nightmares sometimes. They are scary but not really about abuse or our family.

We have slowly started sharing somethings that we were unhappy about as children with him, but we don't want to just outright tell him he was abused if he has no memory of it or isn't ready to hear it. We have an alright relationship with our dad since he stopped abusing us(9yrs ago?). He has another child now so we think it's very important to be there incase anything goes wrong.


Should I begin to let my brother know about his abuse? Or wait for him to come to me? Or something else?",sleep_life,2019-02-02 20:14:14,3,704,20.98,85.99,31.09,14.09,19.56,14.35,95.45,58.95,22.02,17.9,6.39,3.27,0,7.81,0.43,4.12,4.12,12.22,8.52,7.24,8.81,1.99,18.75,3.84,1.42,1.14,0.85,2.56,7.39,3.27,4.12,0.71,1.7,0.71,21.16,4.26,1.14,2.27,10.09,16.48,4.4,1.56,1.56,5.11,1.85,4.97,1.14,0.28,0.28,0.57,1.7,0.57,0.85,0.14,0.14,11.08,7.67,0.99,1.14,0.99,0.57,6.68,11.08,0,11.65,1.42,4.12,6.53,1.42,0.71,0.57,0,0.14,0,0.85,0.28,0.14,0.14,0.28,0,11.79,4.55,1.14,0,0,0.71,0,0.28,0,2.13,1.99,0.99

amms5y,Is this PTSD,"Hi guys,

I’m a Marine combat vet. Got wounded in Afghanistan after a suicide bomber killed my interpreter and double amped my counterpart. Seen about seven people for sure dead and one kid. 

I’m kind of struggling, mildly. I don’t have flash backs, but very angry, I cant sleep sometimes, I drink a fair amount, and I’m overall bothered but not to the point where it’s red alert ptsd like in the movies. 

I honestly think talking about things helps but it’s the subconscious that has been altered slightly. Overall I’m normal, able to function, but it just takes an effect on me for sure. People don’t know what it’s like to literally have bone fragments and lead in your body, and carry that shit around with you. It’s a slight mental fuck. 

There’s a few memories that don’t sit too well with me but they don’t “haunt” me. So I consider myself lucky and am very humble (still have all legs and eyes) but I’ve been affected.

Just looking for sense and direction I guess.

amnlem,Can PTSD surface years after an event?,"Hey,

Just wanted some advice. This has been happening for the past month. About 4 or 5 years ago I was a victim of police brutality and was assaulted, robbed, and thrown in a jail cell by police over fake charges. It was all very distressing from being thrown in a pitch black van in handcuffs and not being told whats happening, and also being told ""Better hope somebody finds ya!"" before throwing me into a cell after I explained I cant call anyone to bail me out since the cop who arrested me took my phone. I mentioned I am diabetic and needed my meds... had to scream from my cell for my medication, I could hear them right around the corner but no one came to my aid and was never given insulin, I rushed home after i was released 6 hours later to take it.

Its giving me a lot of anxiety just writing this. While it was very distressing at the time, I thought I had gotten over it maybe a month after. 

For some reason now ive been having nightmares of it. I wake up drenched in sweat and just full of anxiety, sometimes it feels like my heart is going to jump out my chest. It feels like the anxiety is constant, and im not getting any good sleep. No matter what time I sleep i seem to keep waking up at 4am with the anxiety, nausea, and thoughts of the situation.

Im just wondering if its normal for this to happen for an event that happened years ago? 

Also, I am not anti-police for anyone who might interpret this wrong. I understand some abuse their power when they shouldnt, but theres plenty out there who do their job well.",PixelatedFoodie,2019-02-02 23:44:14,24,304,47.83,22.47,95.6,1.72,17.88,11.84,91.78,57.89,18.42,11.18,9.54,0,0.33,0,1.32,7.24,4.93,15.13,9.54,5.59,5.59,2.63,19.41,3.62,2.96,1.64,1.32,2.3,6.25,1.64,4.61,1.97,0.99,0,6.91,0,0,0,0,12.5,3.62,0.66,1.97,5.26,0.66,2.63,1.97,0.33,0.99,0.66,3.29,1.97,1.32,0,0,5.92,0,0.33,3.62,1.97,0.33,8.22,7.89,0.99,17.43,1.97,6.25,9.21,1.64,0,0.33,0,0,0,0.99,0,0.33,0,0.33,0,11.51,5.26,4.28,0,0,0.66,0.33,0.33,0.66,0,0,0

amrbup,Why I have ptsd..,"When I was in middle school, I was bullied a lot. Physically. I've been assaulted a few times from women when I was a teenager. I remember in 5th grade I got off the bus and two women jumped me, broke my nose and left me bloody.. a few months later another woman assaulted me at school, and would throw me against the locker(she was much older than me). I also got in multiple fights with people and I saw some fucked up shit like a cat getting ripped to shreds by my own dog.. After that I would see dead animals on the side of the road and break down in tears. I was a bully in school too. always built with rage. One time a kid jumped on my back and bit my shoulder and In response I body slammed him on the concrete because he freaked me out. I put him in the hospital and his dad threatened to kill me (I was 13, He was in his 40's). I was going to be charged with assault even though I was defending myself unless I wrote my bully a letter saying that I'm sorry. The reason I was in the wrong is because I'm a huge dude and he was half my size. It was fucking stupid. I also had my nose broken again in high school when I got drunk at a party and this guy jumped me on the side of the road, he bloodied up my face pretty good... a few months later I was assaulted by a couple claiming to be part of the neighborhood watch, they had their 5 year old kid with them and they pinned me down in the woods, wouldn't let me go for an hour. It was completely dark and I was terrified. They told me I was going to murder their child and I had to be stopped, when in reality all I was doing was fucking around at the lake throwing leaves at my buddy. I grew up around drugs, and meth heads which is why all the teenagers around me were so fucked up, they had fucked up parents who didn't give a shit and were abusive. I left town when I was 18 and moved to Seattle, got a job at McDonald's and started therapy. I had a suicide attempt that same year and that put me in the hospital for a few weeks. I left my job at McDonald's a few weeks later, got a job at amazon and started making something of myself. But I struggle around people, I always have. My coping mechanism is painting, I'm an artist outside of work and it's something I care deeply about. I'm thinking of leaving Amazon to become an artist because that's what I want to do. I don't care if it's hard, I've had a lifetime of hardship so I know what hard is. Anyways this is more of a rant than an explanation. I had a very abusive childhood and it's made me have thick skin, It's why I am the man I am..",Weezerismyjam,2019-02-03 08:54:39,0,528,43.88,16.7,95.9,1,18.21,11.74,92.42,59.85,20.27,16.48,13.45,0,0,1.7,1.33,3.79,7.77,13.45,11.74,4.73,7.01,0.57,19.89,4.73,2.08,2.27,1.33,3.03,6.06,0.95,5.11,0.57,3.6,0.57,7.58,0.38,0.76,0.76,2.27,7.01,1.14,1.89,0.95,1.14,0.95,1.52,2.08,0.76,0.19,0.76,3.98,1.89,0.95,0.95,0.19,7.01,0.76,0.19,4.17,1.33,0.76,10.42,7.01,0.38,17.99,2.46,10.04,5.49,1.89,0.76,0.19,0,0,0.76,2.08,1.7,0,0,0,0.19,13.64,6.63,3.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.22,0.76,0

amt2in,Anyone else's PTSD manifest after childbirth?,"Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what my PTSD stems from exactly. I had a kind of traumatic childhood and was in an abusive relationship/raped by said abuser a few years before having kids with my now husband. But I had my first child and got PPD pretty badly, struggled through it without seeking help, my father died when I was pregnant with my second and already worried about having PPD again I sought therapy for a few months after having my second. PTSD amd anxiety was confirmed during therapy but the trigger really wasn't ever found since I moved and didn't continue therapy. It's been 5 years since my last (and only) go at therapy and while it did get better for a little while, it's been getting worse and worse in the last year or two. While I intend on getting back into therapy, I've been curious about how and why everything seemed to come up and surface after I had kids. I feel like these should be some of the happiest times in my life and its just... hard instead.

ive been keeping goldfish for almost 4 years now and havent lost that many, when i did it was to things that i had never even considered, but just two weeks ago i lost a fish i had been wanting for ages, i spent like $10 on this tiny baby because he was so beautiful and i loved him so much. unfortunately, managing cleaning the tank with the heavy dissociation that comes with the start of the new school term was too tough and he wound up passing. im...i kinda expected it would happen, he wasnt holding up like my other fish were, but i was so dissociated and stressed i just didnt do anything about it

ive been feeling so guilty these last two weeks. i took him out of the tank and he had gotten so big he filled up half my palm, when i got him saying he would have fit a quarter would be generous. the last time this happened it was because i had tetras that i moved into the wrong temperature of water and they didnt make it. i cried for like a day and self harmed a lot to try to make up for it in some fucked up way. i havent harmed this time, but i just feel guilty. if im so bad at caring for my pets why do i even have them? ive been needing to clean the tank for like a week but i just cant bring myself to do it

i just woke up about a half hour ago and was watching my girls swim around excitedly because they know its food time and i almost started crying. why are they so happy to see me if i killed their friend? why are they so happy to see me if theyre living in garbage right now? i dont understand why they love me so much

the oldest goldfish in there is is almost 3.5 years old, shes huge and gorgeous and never really liked me until these last few months where she gets so excited to see me. the last few days when ive been in my room shes chosen to sleep right beside the edge of the tank where i am and i just dont get it. shes been through so much over the last three years i dont understand how shes still holding on

i just love her so much and i dont understand why she loves me when ive been so bad to her.

Taking away my stuff, gaslighting me to questioning my own sanity, not letting me shower, only giving me expired food, and fucked up punishments. Horrible.

At any moment my life could have been pulled out from under me. The only thing I ever aspired to have was to feel safe, live in a house with a backyard and have a dog. And I have all that now but I still feel this urge. It’s like, I got addicted to that rush of having my life in danger.   Everything feels so painfully dull and empty I can’t stand it. It’s like, was that it? What do I do now? 

I can’t even sit in a stupid classroom(I’m in college). The whole things seems so god damn pointless. Is the fear of getting a bad grade on a test the closest I’ll ever come to how it was before? Is this it? Oh boo fucking hoo my life is ruined cuz I got a bad grade on a paper, time to go home to my house with electricity and food and without bedbugs or rats or literal shit smeared all over the floor. 

It’s like once you go through some horrible shit it all breaks and you don’t even want a normal life anymore. I don’t think I could stand the dull ness of it. For fucks sake a sick part of me got excited when my mom was having money troubles because we might lose the house and that’s a challenge. A rush. I need this pressure to live. It feels like I’m wilting without it. 


There is a part of me that wants to be a social worker, someone who can help people who are in crisis. I think I might be good at it because I know what it’s like and I would do my god dam best to help and make a difference unlike the social workers that terrorized me as a kid. Maybe that’s why I went through all that so I could go out and help others. But then I ask myself, do I want to spend the rest of my life doing an impossible job: fixing the world? I’ve already been miserable do I really want to spend the rest of my life being that way too? 

There is another part of me that wants to live in the happy cushy world. I want to like feeling safe you know? I don’t even think anyone would hire me for a job like that cuz of, Well, the ptsd.

amzw7v,I'm... honestly just a wreck at this point,"Heya. i'm Zenny. i'm 18M and i'm a hot mess. a total. mess.

Since I was 5 until i was 9-10ish (my memory is still quite messy about the details) i was sexually abused by my eldest biological brother. who was a solid 10 years older than me. My family knows about everything (since I was 15/16. when my PTSD finally surfaced despite the abuse ending.) We disowned him and basically pretend he doesn't even exist. but I digress. Since that time I've been struggling with the physical symptoms of it. the flashbacks. the intense irritability. little energy/trouble sleeping. it even got so bad that when I left for college after graduating. I ended up dropping out a few weeks in due to a near suicide attempt which landed me in the Behavioral Science Unit at the hospital. Which is an entire story on its own.

I've been off and on antidepressants and sleeping meds. and found a set which work. yayyyyy. But now. I face a sort of crossroads. i still want to be successful and happy with my life. but considering the poor house life and financial struggles. Leaving would screw my elderly parents who cant work and my elder brother. (not the same one) who's schizophrenic and just won his SSI case.

an0y84,New to Reddit and this diagnosis // I have questions,"*Hello, before i start this weird post that i'm pretty sure nobody will end up reading let me get a couple things situated. Hi, i'm Uncomfy and i'm new to Reddit. I made this account because specific people in my life say that i have too many issues and i'm uncomfortable to be around. So i made this account specifically for asking questions about things that relate to mental health, and occasionally things i like to indulge in to keep myself preoccupied from the outside world. Hopefully this will cause my issue of being an uncomfortable person.Before i start i must specify that i am not making anything i say up or am doing this for attention. I have no idea how Reddit works, so i apologize if i don't do things that people may find mandatory. (I would appreciate They/them pronouns if you end up responding to this post please.)*

**TW// Slurs, cutting, depressive thoughts**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, lets get this thing started. Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. My whole life i can only remember my mom being an unreliable black blur. You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD. 

&amp;#x200B;

***I skipped A LOT of other issues/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know its been a messy read with tons of grammar mistakes and cringe like wording but i truly appreciate it. I hope you have a good rest of your night/morning and have a wonderful week. &lt;3",UncomfyPerson,2019-02-04 03:53:04,3,1911,22.33,13.36,93.6,4.02,14.05,14.7,91,58.82,23.6,16.69,13.19,0.26,0.63,1.78,0.84,6.91,4.45,12.14,10.05,4.92,6.8,2.83,20.93,4.76,2.72,1.31,1.05,2.41,6.17,1.94,4.13,0.63,1.26,0.99,8.11,1.41,0.05,2.35,0.37,14.23,3.51,1.41,2.62,2.67,2.04,3.72,2.09,0.31,0.94,0.84,2.04,0.63,1.2,0.1,0.26,6.28,1.2,0.99,2.09,1.57,0.78,7.64,8.74,0.99,14.13,2.15,5.65,6.54,1.31,0.68,0.99,0.37,0.1,0.16,0.84,0.37,0.42,0.05,0.1,0,18.47,7.12,4.97,0,0.47,0.26,0,0,0,2.35,0.84,2.46
an17tk,Help,"I don’t know if I have PTSD three days ago my boyfriend had a seizure while we were at my apartment. We were alone and it was a very violent seizure, he stopped breathing for a little and I thought he was actually gonna die. I called 911 And he has a appointment for the neurologist in two weeks (it’s the soonest one) but I think I might be traumatized from the event. I have barley ate, I only sleep from being so tired from not eating and by smoking myself to sleep. I already have anxiety and depression which was going on before this and I could force myself to eat if i smoked weed. Now I can’t even if I’ve been smoking all day I don’t even feel hungry even if I have barley eaten anything for days! I keep having flashbacks of the event at random times of the day and start to tear up and sometimes if I’m alone I’ll cry forever about it. We got in a fight about it last night because he doesn’t understand why I was “acting strange all day” he doesnt remember what happened luckily BUT I DO and I know if he saw what I saw he would understand but he didn’t and it was horrible. He wants me to be able to get over it but I can’t. I usually am really good at quickly getting over traumatic events and can push it under the rug until I forget about it but I’m honestly broken.

an1mt8,Parents had sex in bed next to me when I was 10...,"I’m sorry if this post isn’t worthy of this sub but I need to post it somewhere.
Just to start off, I want to give some backstory. I am now 14. When I was seven, my parents who were together for 8 years split up(never married) but there were no harsh feelings. They split up because they were shouting at eachother a lot and they disagreed on how to parent me. When I was six, I was diagnosed with high functioning autism (I’m like any normal person but have a difficult time socially and have anxiety). 
That’s the backstory.
Here’s where it gets weird. It was 2014, I was ten, it was the summer and the world cup. My parents decided to take me to a hotel with them as a holiday. It was fine the first day but on the second day there was a match. We watched it in our hotel room but I got tired and fell asleep halfway through. I can remember this perfectly. The match was nearly over when I woke up. I heard moaning and squeaking next to me so I slowly turned on my bed to see what was going on. At the time I had no idea what was happening but a few years later I understood. I watched for what could be 5 seconds or 5 minutes. I was really confused. I got up (I used to sleep walk so I fake sleepwalked to the toilet) and thankfully they stopped. I heard them talking and saying (i’m paraphrasing btw) “never again” or some shit. It stayed in my head for 2 years until I understood. One day, when I was twelve, I confronted my mother about it and she just said (again, paraphrasing) “sex is a natural thing” and “it was only a one time thing”. Only until I started crying and screaming at her why she didn’t even apologise to me. We never spoke of it again. I had forgotten about it after getting kind of closure but recently I had a dream that they did it again and it’s really bugging me.
My questions are:
Am I in the wrong and do I not deserve an automatic apology?
What can I do to forget about it?
I really don’t want to talk to them about it again.
Thanks so much to you guys who read all of this :)

an29rz,Flashbacks on flashbacks,"Within the past year, a lot of light has been shed on the state of my mental health. For a decade, I had the Bipolar II diagnosis forced on me until I began doing some research of my own. Turns out I have CPTSD from a childhood of neglect, sex trafficking, physical/emotional abuse, and the like. Only recently have I been able to identify my flashbacks as actual flashbacks, before I was under the impression that I was simply remembering things I didn’t like to remember; I now realize that my days are full of flashbacks, sometimes one right after another. Makes sense why I’m a ~ pot head ~. Not only do I use pot to dissociate, I use it as a sleep aid to prevent night terrors. What I’m wondering is if this is common — to live your whole life in constant flashbacks? Can anyone relate? How do you cope?

TL;DR 
CPTSD causes back to back flashbacks - all day, everyday. Can anyone else relate?

Relief washed over me knowing that it was a bird's miscalculation that caused the sound and resulting damage, but then I felt so stupid for overreacting.

an3i05,i feel like everything is happening again,"hey so i don’t think i have ptsd but i wasn’t sure where else to post this??

about two years ago i was emotionally abused by a significant other who i trusted with all my heart and he was my whole world.
over the course of the past two months i’ve been emotionally (and kinda physically?? i’m not sure?) abused by a kinda significant other and just realized it about a week ago. the similarities between the two are striking, from the manipulation techniques to everything they said near the beginning of the relationship and even the advice they gave.

the thing which i don’t understand though is that starting last night i started feeling as if i ‘went back in time’. like my mind went back to two years ago when the first relationship was happening (it’s probably triggered by the most recent one?) and it feels so strange. it’s exactly the same feelings and fear and anxiety and i feel as if i’m being split in two. i feel like i’m simultaneously that scared sympathetic girl who would give him as many chances as he asked for but i also feel like ‘now me’, like the present me who’s angry and bitter and rough. i’ve been fluctuating between the two ‘me’s’ throughout the whole day.
it also feels like i’m fluctuating in and out of the ‘past’ too. it feels like the guy from the first relationship is going to text me at any time and i know it’s irrational but i don’t know what to do.

thank you so much if you read up to here. i really want to know what’s happening right now and WHY i’m feeling this way but honestly any comment would help. i legitimately feel like i’m going insane.

an6rcv,how do you get through this?,"I dont know if this belongs here or if there's a more general r/mentalhealth where this should go.  I just got home from driving my mom home from the doctor and I'm just...ugh.  there's a whole thing.  I just want to know if it gets better, if it ever goes away.  Can PTSD be beaten?   


I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2014.  It was a relief for me then because up until that point I didnt know I what I was experiencing and I was seriously taking steps towards suicide because I thought I was just going insane, that everyone dealt with these symptoms and I was just a wimp about it.  Finding out it was PTSD presented a light at the end of the tunnel, I guess, ""Oh.  I know what this thing is now.  it's got a history of medical treatments that have worked.  Entire communities of people struggle with this and help each other through it.  I'm not alone"".      


I spent the next however long fighting.  Like, actually fighting.  I got medicine, I started trying to find coping mechanisms for the panic attacks.  Panic attacks, for me, on a bad day happen a bunch.  I'll have one, it'll last about ten or twenty minutes, I'll get some time as like a break and then I'll have another one.  it's SO exhausting and I hate it, but the knowledge that what I was experiencing had a name gave me hope that it could lessen.    


Rewinding the clock a bit, my trauma came about through some childhood nonsense (who doesnt have a little bit of childhood nonsense that induces trauma, amirite?) which really kicked into high gear around the time that I was 16.  I was sexually assaulted (I'm a guy), but I didnt want to admit it.  To be honest, I dont think I ever thought about it at all. I got super depressed after that.  I stopped doing EVERYTHING.  The next year in college, I was assaulted, left unconscious inside of a car wrecked in a ditch, raped, dropped out, was homeless, got three jobs, raped again, maintained the three jobs, went back home, went back to school, got diagnosed.  FOCUSED, got all A's, got scholarships, took out a small loan, went back to school and graduated in two years with a degree in psychology.    


I skimmed over all the nonsense there.  maybe I'll make a longer post about my story if I ever find the right subreddit.  At any rate, I'm posting today because the panic attacks never stopped.  I was diagnosed and the medicine they gave me induced more panic attacks. The only reason I'm here right now is that I was determined not to fail a second time.  But I'm burnt out.  When I went away to college the second time I got a single dorm so that I wouldnt wake anyone up/be embarrassed by someone else seeing my night terrors.  I would pretty much go to work, class, then back to my dorm to have panic attacks where no one can see and to study.  After graduating, I've opened up more about my PTSD, the assaults, the trauma or whatever it's called to my friends and to professionals (until I lost health insurance).  I didnt want my friends to ""fix"" me, I just wanted them to know that I need space sometimes/talk about what some of my struggles are.  I dont like how this opening up has affected my friendships.    


The PTSD is starting to cost me things REAL things.  All my relationships have started to fail in ways they never have before.  I dont have a handle on this.  I've lost so many friends and I dont want to lose any more.  what do I do?  I dont think the panic attacks are going to stop, and that's fine.  I can deal.  I just dont want to be alone and I can tell that's where I'm headed.    


Does anyone have any tips?  How do you get through this?  How do you not drag the people you love down with you?  I know that no one is going to endorse ""going it alone"" but like... I feel like I have to go through this alone.  I just dont want to be alone while I do.  does that make sense?

an86pz,Should I change therapists if my current T keeps having difficulty staying awake mid-session?,"Hello all, I'm having a bit of a dilemma. TL;DR below.

I've been seeing my current therapist for about a year and a half now. She specializes in trauma and dissociation so I thought she would be a good fit for me. But lately, I've been having a lot of doubts in her ability to help me. I know she's well qualified, but I'm having a difficult time deciding whether I should keep seeing her or attempt to find a new therapist.

I have severe PTSD from a very traumatic childhood and have tremendous trust issues. It's very difficult for me to trust a therapist, but I'm so desperate for help from my debilitating symptoms (such as my inability to have relationships, hold down a job, flashbacks, compulsive isolation, etc.) that I keep seeing her hoping one day, she'll find a way to help me.

But as of late, I've noticed a pattern where if I'm talking and not actively engaging her, she'll show signs that she's fighting off sleep, similar to a student who is having a hard time staying awake at a school lecture they find boring. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt (thinking maybe she's sleep deprived or struggling with old age), and I have for months, but it's starting to bother me. It seems to happen at least every other session and even occurred once when my sister was attending a session with me. 

I have felt stuck in therapy for months, making only very gradual progress. But overall, I feel the progress is being made by me outside of therapy, and then I check-in with her to show her how I'm doing and improving. It's very rare when I leave therapy feeling that I've made progress. I wish she could help me more.

I've seen over 15 different therapists over the years. For the longest time, I thought it was just me. I thought my disorder and trauma was just so complex that no one could help me. But now I'm questioning if maybe it isn't me but my current therapist, and if it's just my fear of abandonment and fear of hurting her feelings that are keeping me from seeing the truth of needing to find a new therapist. I'm not really sure what to do.

I really want to make progress forward, I'm desperate for help. I so hoped this therapist would be the one, but I'm having a lot of doubts. Any comments/suggestions/personal-insights would be appreciated. Thank you.

TL;DR: Been seeing current therapist for 1.5 years, afraid she's not the therapist for me. Not sure what to do. Afraid I'm too messed up for anyone to help me.

an9bit,How to bring up past trauma to a therapist? (Tw sexual assault),"So I was diagnosed with PTSD after I was assaulted in 2012. 

In 2015 I was raped by my fiancé at the time. I’ve told maybe 2 people about it since my ex and I broke up. 

My PTSD flashbacks/panic attacks aren’t about the 2012 assault anymore but about the 2015 rape. And it affects me a lot. 

I’m just not sure how to bring it up at this point to my therapist. I’ve been seeing her for years and I’ve never brought it up to her despite it being 3 years ago. 

I see her tomorrow (2/5/19) and I wanna tell her because I had a really emotional night related to it and idk how to just bring it up since it was so long ago. 

The first one I was able to talk about because it was brought up in my initial assessment if I had a history of abuse or assault. 

The rape in 2015 happened after that initial assessment so idk. I spent a long time trying to forgive him for what happened. Then we broke up. And I spent a long time just trying to move on from all of it. 

Now I think I’m ready to actually grieve and heal but idk how to tell her that. 

Idk. Ways I can tell her tomorrow? 

Thanks 💕",ariana_mcclair,2019-02-04 18:12:34,2,236,34.06,13.53,98.09,1,12.42,12.29,92.37,62.29,21.61,15.25,11.86,0.42,0,2.97,0,6.36,4.66,17.8,7.63,8.05,8.9,2.97,16.95,1.27,0.85,2.12,5.08,0.85,8.47,2.12,6.36,0.42,3.81,1.27,7.2,0,0,2.54,0.42,12.71,1.69,3.81,0.85,2.54,1.27,3.81,0.85,0.85,0,0,3.39,0,1.69,1.69,0,7.2,0.42,1.69,5.08,0,0,8.9,8.47,1.69,19.92,2.54,7.63,9.75,0,0,0,0.85,0,0.42,2.54,0,1.69,0,0,1.69,12.71,6.36,0,0,0,0.85,0,0,0,2.54,1.69,1.27
anaaci,Physical symptoms?,"I got a tentative diagnosis of PTSD at the end of last year by my therapist, and have been going to therapy on and off for a while now. I have nightmares sometimes, and panic attacks pretty often, but I also started passing out and ‘losing time’ and I’m not sure if it’s related to PTSD or if it’s a different thing, so I’m wondering if anyone here has had any related symptoms. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post it, but honestly you guys seem like a good community (this is more or less a throwaway, but I’ve been lurking for a while on another account). And I know that it says no medical advice, and I don’t know if this would really fall into it- I’m seeing a doctor regularly, and I don’t want advice about what to do more than just wanting to know if this is something other people experience. Anyways, when I black out it doesn’t feel at all like a panic attack, my vision goes dark while when I have a panic attack my vision goes bright and everything looks white. Also, during panic attacks I feel over sensitive/ every sense seems alarmingly heightened, but when I pass out it just feels like I completely lose control, everything goes black and I can feel myself falling and then I wake up. Ive checked with my doctor to see if it could be caused by heart problems as they run in the family, but all results came back completely normal. Honestly I didn’t even think of it being related to PTSD until a friend suggested it. Along with passing out, there has also been days where I look at the time and realize that somehow four or five hours passed by without me recalling any of it. I don’t use any substances, and honestly it’s a fairly scary experience and I don’t know if any of you have felt anything like that that ended up being related to PTSD. Thanks in advance! Sorry that this is kind of a messy post.

anahuj,I’m becoming scared of my boyfriend due to my PTSD (TW: Mention of sexual assault),"Hi everyone. I have been dating my current boyfriend for two months. He knows about my sexual assault and PTSD. He always triple checks that I’m comfortable with any intimacy that we have. My PTSD comes from an experience where I gave a guy a blowjob while blackout drunk. Last night was the first time I have my boyfriend a blowjob (after he made sure that I was absolutely okay with it). I also gave him one this morning. At the time, I was really happy that I was doing something for him since he does so much for me. But now...I’m having intrusive flashbacks, dissociation/floaty feeling, and negative self-talk. Also, being close to him right now (physical presence “close”) is making me really anxious. I’m scared of him when I have no reason to be scared. I want to tell him this but it’s so hard to think up how to tell him and how to get the strength to tell him. 
I don’t want to be scared of him. Please, if anyone has advice how to deal with this crippling anxiety, I would greatly appreciate it.

anbcls,Not sure where to go from here,"First time poster.

I recognise that I am suffering PTSD from a miscarriage and subsequent surgical evac of that pregnancy, which isn’t helped by the fact I work in maternity.

My work are fairly supportive and I had what was deemed the appropriate time off after my miscarriage, but I find myself extremely affected by similar cases in work. I’m also terrified of the prospect of becoming pregnant again and keep running worse case scenarios in my head.

I have had bad flashbacks, and when I needed another General Anaesthetic later on last year, again bad flashbacks. 

I also have ptsd from personal examinations and just don’t know how I’m going to cope with future ones (smears, pregnancy exams etc)

I’m finding it difficult speaking to anyone about or where to even start looking to start to help with all this.

It was terrifying and I'm scared to try again because I have the worst luck and blew my tire on my way back. I sat there while my boyfriend changed my tire in so much of a panic it lasted for over 3 hours where he kept trying to tell me it's ok and it was an honest mistake but I was so upset it felt like my heart was going to explode and i couldnt breathe let alone see through the tears.

anfmgb,I forgot how utterly exhausting being triggered is.,"I’ve got my PTSD under control for the most part. I’m not super easily triggered. If I feel something coming on, I’m able to ground myself. 

I’ve been doing martial arts for a few years ago. I started by infrequently going to Aikido and Taihojutsu/Judo classes. I was doing them with a FWB, we’ll call Nick. When we stopped sleeping together, we remained close friends and classmates. When we started getting into ground grappling in Taihojutsu, I told Nick about how I was diagnosed with PTSD and I was afraid of getting triggered. He’s been extremely helpful, understanding, and cautious with me. 

A couple of months ago we took up BJJ and cardio kickboxing together. So now I go to BJJ 3-5 times a week and kickboxing 2-3 times a week, on top of weekly Aikido and infrequent Taihojutsu. 

I’ve been able to power through/ground myself from every trigger in BJJ. Even so much as working with a guy who looks EXACTLY like my abusive ex. It’s really uncanny. The only person in these classes who knows about my history is Nick. 

So yesterday, during the street self-defense portion of our kickboxing class, we worked on “What if somebody came up to you and tried to choke you from the front?” Immediately I was thrown off. Nick could tell I wasn’t okay. He kept asking if I was okay, if I wanted to do something else. I powered through thinking, “No I should learn this. So it never happens again.”

But still. Damn. I was shook. I was able to distract myself during BJJ. But I’m still so tired and foggy brained.",dinosaur_apocalypse,2019-02-05 08:14:04,2,285,31.45,41.67,95.01,20.46,10.56,18.95,88.77,54.74,17.89,14.39,10.18,2.46,0.7,0.7,0.35,3.51,3.51,14.04,9.82,7.37,8.77,1.4,20,3.51,1.4,2.46,1.4,2.11,4.21,1.75,2.11,0.7,0.7,0,10.18,0,1.4,0,1.05,12.28,2.46,2.46,2.46,2.81,1.4,3.51,0.7,0.35,0,0.35,2.81,0.7,1.75,0.35,0,11.23,4.21,2.81,2.11,1.4,1.05,9.82,6.67,1.05,17.89,2.11,7.02,8.77,2.46,0.35,0,0,0,0,1.75,0.35,0.35,0.7,0,0,20,9.12,3.86,0,0,0.35,0,1.05,1.4,3.51,0,0.7
anggeg,i’m proving everyone wrong and it’s exhausting,"a year ago on march 15 i was roofied and raped by two men. i went to police. they did nothing even thought the two guys posted the whole thing to snapchat. the police said svu has no access to snapchat. i had a lot of bruises and had vaginal trauma which they wrote off as birth control. hundreds of people saw the video. i ended up withdrawing my case. after it happened for months i drank myself to oblivion and spent almost all my time at strip clubs. which sounds weird but it brought me comfort knowing that all the guys were focused on the other girls and not me.

anii7b,"I have PTSD and therapy, meds, etc don't work. no idea where to turn. also this may be triggering so be warned.","I have been through a lot in my life from childhood trauma of being raped, molested by my step dad, he would even tie me to a tree for days on end with no food or water. my mom over looked it because she just wanted someone, anyone to be with. he would even beat me till I was bleeding.

Ran away at 18, found a girlfriend at 19, got her pregnant then 8 months in she dies with our daughter. I become homeless and an alcoholic, lose my business her and I both ran together. 

I over come alcoholism on my own, get my CDL but couldn't get a trucking company to hire me. I still am homeless doing odd jobs. have witnessed over 40 deaths and 12 of them were suicides, 6 of those suicides were right in front of me where I couldn't stop them, most were strangers, one was a friend of mine and a couple others were cousins of mine. 

Never knew my real dad till I was 23 then he died a few months later liver failure then when I was 25 lost my mom to suicide. I have been shot at while being robbed, stabbed while being robbed, I have had family try to kill me and I even tried killing myself many times and was even in a coma for a few months.

I have tried therapy, sitting and talking, opening up was the hardest so I spent a year writing everything down then showing it to the therapist and have had several of them think I was just making stuff up, others would say snarky remarks and others would just ask me, ""how does all of this make you feel?"" 

I even been to psychiatrists, and found out I have PTSD, Severe social anxiety, Severe chronic depression, OCD, ADD which now they say doesn't exist and is now called ADHD, I been told I have  Severe abandonment issues, which I can literally see that I do have that. and I found out I have a pretty deep form of Dyslexia just I don't see words backwards but I got all the other signs of it and am slow at learning and understanding things.

Nothing works for me, I tried many things except weed and such, but I won't ever go down that road because I have a very addictive personality and anything that makes me feel good or feel fine, I become highly addicted to and chase after that feeling over and over. 

But sleeping at nights is horrible, I have nightmares of things that I been through or seen or have had happen to me, I wake up screaming ""help me"", or wake up in cold sweats and shaking uncontrollably, or waking up having severe panic attacks and struggling to breath. 

I spend every day, day in day out trying to avoid things that can trigger me, it feels as if I am walking on egg shells all day long and gets so tiring of this. I am 38 and have been dealing with this for the past 15 years. it slowly started but I feel it grew and grew after trauma, after trauma and so on. 

I even had one therapist/psychiatrist tell me that it is too deep seeded that nothing will help. 

TL;DR, I am 38 and been through 34 years of trauma and bs, losing people to suicide and death, been homeless for ten plus years. therapy, meds, etc doesn't work. I have ptsd and a few other mental issues.

My past wont let go
Its grip is deepening
Nothing I did wrong
But this pain is seething
I look to the sky
And stare at the ground
I just want it to end
I want to live and be happy
Loved and appreciated 
All I have is abandonment
And the solitude it created
I look to my friends
I listen to family 
Statements like Just be happy
And you need to cheer up
They stab me to the core
What’s left is rotten
Damage and baggage 
Anderson and sorrow
Pain and anxiety
Flashbacks so real
I feel what I felt
As the time it happened 
I see the sights, smell the smells
I am locked up inside
My personal hell
I don’t want to do this
Face it daily
But my responsibilities 
I don’t take lightly
I promise you this
I will keep on trying
But don’t give me shit
If you see me crying
It’s the only release I have
Because words tend to fail me.

anmc54,"Is it possible I have PTSD from my infancy, without any memory of the cause/trauma? (Throw Away Account)","I've had A LOT of symptoms of PTSD my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

As a child, my mom had me see multiple counselors, psychiatrists, and apparently even a neuropsychologist (this one was recent news to me). I'd been put on many different medications, mostly for anxiety and depression.

&amp;#x200B;

I was compulsive and picky about so many things, especially food. Sleep has always been terrible for me. From as young as I can remember to about age 11, I couldn't sleep alone. My mom had to sleep in the same bed as me every single night because I had constant nightmares. The tried for years to assure me that she just in the other room and would be there for me, if I woke up from a nightmare. Still, that wasn't enough, I couldn't even fall asleep alone out of my a fear I still don't know. I was sort of scared of that dark, but I knew that wasn't what kept me from sleeping alone because no amount of light made a difference. I also wasn't scared of the nightmares themselves. The only reason I eventually was able to sleep ""alone"" was because I got a dog at that age, who would sleep with me every single night. Although, that didn't stop the nightmares and terrible sleep, my dog just became a substitute for my dog.

&amp;#x200B;

My cognitive development definitely lagged behind everyone I knew around my age, growing up. That, plus my dyslexia, had me put in a special education class in elementary school. In middle school and high school, I got assisted learning opportunities that I refused to take advantage of because I never wanted them, or to have been in a special education class back in elementary school. I struggled with making and maintaining friendships. I always felt alone no matter how close I was to family and friends, or how many friend I have.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these things, and so much more, has made my life post-high-school extremely difficult. I've struggled maintaining jobs, keeping up in classes, and I've given up on just about everything my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like, if I do have PTSD, it doesn't make sense. All of my anxiety, depression, stress, and previously listed problems have burdened me for as long as I can remember. My parents treat me like I was just born this way because I had colic as a baby, too. I've been passively treated like I'm broken and a problem by my family my entire life, but it's so passive. They've never hit me. I've never been sexually abused. They don't even verbally abuse me. Sure, my parents aren't great parents (they're honestly pretty shit at parenting, both my sister and I agree on), and they've said some awful things to me (especially when I had been aggressive towards them or had an emotional outburst), but there was no argument for verbal abuse aside from the passive comments they'd make the made me feel like a broken problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Feeling and being treated like a broken problem isn't going to give me PTSD. All of my struggles growing up never got an explanation. I've even been seeing the same (fantastic) therapist for over 6 years, and I finally found an anti-depressant that I see real benefits from, but most of the problems that I mentioned in past tense still exist today. I still can't hold a job. I'm still a drop out. I still struggle with SO MUCH in life. I feel like I can never be a functioning adult. Worst of all, I feel like I'm sleep deprived from the constant nightmares that never seem to have any relevance to anything going on in my day-to-day life.

&amp;#x200B;

I just spent all day, today, in a disassociated state because I started to mentally explore the idea that I could have experienced trauma in my infancy that lead to something like life-long PTSD, but I couldn't find any answers in my head. I just ended up having to cancel a lot of stuff I had planned today because I was distraught that I could barely look at or talk to anyone without having a panic attack. All just because I was deeply thinking about if and how I could have experienced an early childhood trauma that snowballed into all of this, without even finding any answers.",throwAwayAccountPTSD,2019-02-05 19:16:32,9,765,35.52,7.35,92.88,1,18.66,17.39,92.16,57.12,17.78,13.33,12.29,0,0,0.13,0.92,4.44,4.84,14.38,10.2,6.93,7.19,3.27,16.47,5.88,3.14,0.78,0.65,4.05,8.24,1.83,6.41,1.7,0.92,1.18,4.58,1.31,0.26,0.52,0,16.99,3.4,2.61,2.22,3.27,3.66,3.4,2.09,0.78,0.13,0.78,3.01,1.44,1.31,0.13,0.13,7.06,1.18,0.78,3.27,1.18,1.05,7.45,6.93,0.39,13.07,1.44,6.01,5.62,2.48,0.26,0.52,0.26,0,0,0.26,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,20.52,5.1,5.49,0,1.83,0.13,0,0.78,0.26,3.66,1.31,1.96

ano3ol,Flashbacks vs intrusive memories,"TLDR: Can someone help me understand the difference? 
----
I have really bad memories that always come to the forefront of my mind when I lay down to sleep and no matter how many times I tell my brain to stop it always loops back around to it or something similar. Sometimes this isnt memory though sometimes its just fake arguments about my condition with people who invalidate it or other generally negative fake possible interactions. I just end up feeling so strongly about it or other memories or other fake situations that i end up crying over it. I thought at least the memory parts were mini flashbacks but looking it up lots of sites say stuff like ""strong emotions that you felt while it was happening"" or ""smelling or hearing things that happened when the trauma happened"" and of course the typical ""lost touch with reality and literally thinks they're back in the situation"". I think some of the above might qualify but im not sure if all of it would? Would this be considered an ""episode""

I do have dreams and other types of flashbacks but the intrusive bad memories/situations only happen right before bed. Ive been diagnosed and have a doctor for this stuff but no ones actually really described the disorder properly to me so i was hoping someone could share what their flashbacks feel like (I will talk to my doc about it but i dont see her till Saturday) . What actually happens with the senses and what youre thinking when it happens. Can you stop it before it gets too bad? 

I hate that all flashbacks ive ever seen on media are like crystal clear movie scenes that play in your head. I was traumatized as a child and my memory is poor. Thats nothing like my flashbacks. Thats not like a lot of flashbacks.

ano8sh,Wanting to be left alone,"I have been super withdrawn lately, which isn't anything too weird for me honestly. I sometimes just need to detach and be alone. I've only really seen and talked to some online friends and my boyfriend. Which, again I just DO sometimes. But I haven't been talking to a friend I'm going to break things off with, because she betrayed my trust, for a few weeks and she decided to make a federal case about it. She started calling me and then made our mutual friends freak out by calling them when I wouldn't answer. 

I was just so angry I [i]couldn't[/i] talk to her. I've had anger issues as long as I can remember and I get heart palpitations once I get to a certain point of anger. And I just feel cornered because I need to be left alone so I can calm down enough to talk to her...but with everyone messaging me wondering why I'm not going out or replying in the group chat, I have to either not say anything, or explain the whole damn thing 10 times. 

I'm just really annoyed because she made it sound like I was in a suicide crisis just because I wouldn't answer her. Which people believed because I am mentally ill, but I really don't want people losing their minds everytime I feel a little asocial. I always reach out when I need help. And yes, I have been triggered as hell, but badgering me is hurting, not helping.

She was actually really excited to see me based on that knowledge.

Now, I have this appointment tomorrow. I can't wait. This morning when I was looking through my emails from my kids school, see her name as one of the moms who will be helping at my son's Valentines Day party. She has a child in the same class as my child. She has a very unique name and her child does not have the same last name (I have no idea who the child is to be honest). This would be considered a conflict of interest right?

antv1z,The Only Way Out is Through: Using Virtual Reality for PTSD in Veterans,"In 1997, virtual reality, then a newly developed technology, was hypothesized to be an effective method of delivering exposure therapy. In virtual reality exposure therapy, the person is immersed in a computer-created virtual environment. While initially developed for advanced game play, it was quickly realized that the technology could also be used therapeutically.  The first study with ten veterans demonstrated that this therapy was effective in symptom improvement in all participants. This success was considered so significant that after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York’s World Trade Center, burn victims suffering from PTSD were treated using virtual reality exposure techniques. The outcomes for this treatment situation was also extremely successful. 

To date, virtual reality exposure therapy for PTSD has primarily been used with Vietnam War veterans so the virtual setting includes such imagery as helicopters and jungles. Research has shown that this type of therapy helps to reduce PTSD symptoms in these veterans. A few subsequent studies conducted with small numbers of Iraq and Afghanistan War vets found that virtual reality based therapy was also helpful in reducing symptoms in these former soldiers.

I wanna ask if anyone relate to that. 

I live in a house with 2 rooms and one room with curtains and the other is not but when I am in the room that doesn't have curtains or the bathroom I feel afraid for some reason.

keep in mind my bathroom does not have any windows or something like that but for some reason, I still feel afraid.

So the moment I wake up I stay in the room that has curtains and one more thing that I find really hard to get a shower now because I am afraid of the bathroom so the last time I got a shower was 2 weeks ago.

Last time I took a shower I did it really fast so I wasn't that clean and when I was taking the shower I was putting pressure on my teeth so when I finished the shower I came out of the shower my teeth hurt.

TL;DR: When I came out to my grandmother at the age of 12, she condemned me to hell with a sit down the next time she saw me. Lied to Dad about how I felt, bottled it up for two years, and finally tell the truth. He doesn't believe me and forces me around her until another year, when I'm diagnosed with PTSD.

So, I've been going through PTSD treatment. This treatment is basically the recognization of cognitive distortions and the fixing of those thinking errors, then telling the story in any way you want. I've been doing this for about 3 months. About month in, I started having nightmares about the event and family leaving me in general, which affected my sleep. This also led to a rise in depression, which led to me falling behind on school work.

any2tq,"PTSD from mental and physical abuse, looking for kind words or just to feel understood","I'm without a vehicle currently, making it difficult to go to group meetings or find a compatible therapist... and I feel like my brain is very ill. Trying my best to make sense, but I'm feeling out of it right now. 

A lot of what I remember from growing up, is that my dad was angry, sometimes he took it out on the kids, usually with harsh words but now and then with physical violence. 

I'm now 26. 

When I was 22, I fell for a 20 year old guy after months of him working really hard to get me involved. I was in a relationship that was fairly new, so I ended up cheating for the only time. I got with the 20 year old. The (now) ex, had severe trauma from being cheated on, and I was crummy enough to do that to him again...

Now I'm in a steady healthy relationship with neither of those guys, but my PTSD causes obsessive thoughts of me feeling like I cheated on my boyfriend. I feel so much guilt, like I'm putting on a big show, lying. I would never do that again. I don't know how to let go of the shame and feelings of needing to make sure I've covered all of my bases in lying. In the mornings when I leave his apartment and he's already gone, I pace around for 20 mins checking (for what, idek) and get panicky when I think I left my phone at his place. Mind you, there is nothing for me to hide. 

Back to the 20 year old that got me to cheat. He had red flags that seemed minor because I was so naive. One night while at my parents, I told my mom, ""he reminds me so much of dad"". My mom gave me a weird scared look that I thought was strange because my parents are still together, and they act like the abuse as a child wasn't ever real (which also messes with my brain, because sometimes I beat myself up like I'm making up this pain). She said, ""I hope he doesn't have his anger..."" and sounded so sad. I reassured her. 

SO this guy and I end up dating for 2+ years off and on. He played some weird gaslighting games and tried cheating and played on my emotions, saying he suffers from sex addiction, he's getting help. Idk it just got weirder and weirder and I am not going into full detail... but he was doing things like seeking out orgies on Craigslist and getting bjs in the cemetery from 50 yr old men. 
I try, finally, to confront this guy and leave him and he doesn't let me leave, instead I spend the night in the ER getting my face fixed. 

And still he manipulated me into getting back with him. He CONTINUED to lie and cheat, we had so many traumatic nights where we would fight and I would be awake for 72 hours. Near the end of it all, he would flat out ignore me for days. And then finally answer me, just to tell my I'm a psychopath, he will never want me, and to go kill myself. 

Alright, so now that I'm in this great healthy relationship... my brain keeps telling me it's still happening. I have to live with this sickening paranoia if I want to be in the actual relationship of my dreams. I know logically the man I'm with would never hurt me. Yet I'm obsessed with catching him. I always feel like I can't go have fun because the one time I'm not paying attention he will know, and use the chance to cheat. 

I have had nightmares, where I wake up in a panic attack from dreams where my new boyfriend is doing those same things that my ex did. One night, my boyfriend tried comforting me by saying ""it was just a dream, it wasn't real"". Not helpful. 

I know it takes time to heal... I just feel incredibly alone and helpless. I feel like it's such a serious situation I went through, that people don't understand and judge me. Everyone victim-blames because I stayed. Not to mention, when I was with him, I had only my cousin on my side. I lost all of my friends, broke contact with my family... nobody knows the extent and I'm sick of people having the ""it wasn't that bad"" attitude on my bad days...",freckleddeerborn,2019-02-06 17:05:59,7,766,28.62,24.85,93.08,1,15.96,13.58,93.86,59.14,21.41,16.71,12.79,0.26,0.13,3.39,0.13,4.7,4.05,14.1,8.75,6.79,7.44,2.61,19.58,4.18,1.96,1.44,1.57,1.17,9.01,1.96,6.92,1.04,2.35,0.91,10.7,1.04,1.17,0.52,4.57,11.36,3.39,1.7,1.31,1.83,1.44,2.48,3,0.52,0.65,1.7,2.09,0.65,1.17,0.26,0,8.62,2.61,1.96,2.35,1.7,0.52,5.48,10.7,0.78,15.93,1.83,6.4,8.09,0.39,1.04,0.26,0.26,0,0.26,0.65,0,0.13,0.13,0.13,0.13,18.8,8.22,5.22,0,0,0,0,0.13,1.04,3.26,0.78,0.13
any5jm,Ptsd and hallucinations and more,"Hi,

For the past 9ish months I’ve posted here and on the bipolar forum about the onset of intense hallucinations, illusions, confusion and delirium. All of which landed me in the ER via ambulance multiple times. 

I’ve had ptsd for a long time. I first developed it in 2007 but felt recovered in 2012. Due to additional trauma in 2015, I developed ptsd again in 2017. Up until early 2018, my symptoms were textbook. Panic, fear, insomnia, flashbacks, dissociation and derealization. I was off and on suicidal and self harming. But in 2018 everything changed. My symptoms became psychotic and I’ve written about that a few times here. 

The reason I’m bringing this up is that I’ve seen a new psychiatrist in my new city, and after just minutes of explaining my long psychiatric history and then the sudden onset of these psychotic symptoms, I’ve been told he believes i have an infection in my brain. Likely caused by something I’ve encountered while living and doing humanitarian efforts in tropical countries. 

I know this post is not directly related to ptsd. My ptsd is related to that time in those countries though, and I’m not sure how to feel about this possible diagnosis. It’s a very serious diagnosis with serious treatment and consequences and I’m just starting the process to investigate it. I am scared. I have this deep terror that makes me black out and this is contributing to it.

But I guess I also would be relieved if I had an organic reason to have suddenly started having such intense hallucinations and illusions and confusion. My brain has literally felt like it’s been disintegrating. 

I’m sorry for the long rambly post.

anylr4,How do I know the difference between PTSD and irrational paranoia?,"My question is how can I tell the difference between PTSD symptoms and paranoia in the sense of the mental illness on its own. 

I don’t exactly feel safe in my own house, but safe enough knowing that I know my exit points, choke point at the top of the stairs and have a weapon at hand if need be, but outside on my own I feel insanely vulnerable. 

Just going outside to the shop down the street has me on edge, anyone who looks at me long enough has me thinking that they have malicious thoughts, making them the ‘enemy’, even though I know they aren’t and it’s all in my head, I can’t feel but to get the fight or flight response from simply being looked at. If I’m walking down the street alone and see someone walking toward me I instinctively get on edge and create an exit/action plan. Just to clarify because I’m more than aware that this post does sound crazy enough as it is, I have absolutely no need or desire to take ‘preemptive action’ against any of these people, rationally I know that I’m not under threat and I will never take any action against the imaginary threat except avoid them or come back later when the area is less busy. 

When I hear a car stop outside my house or hear a neighbours door open/close I immediately go into sentry mode and watch out my window until they leave or I have deemed the area clear, I also can not go to sleep until I’ve checked twice that all of my locks are locked and all doors are secured.

I understand that people with PTSD rarely feel safe and are on edge a lot of the time, but am I taking this to an extreme where it’s become it’s own mental illness aside from the PTSD?

Unfortunately they are the only doctors my insurance covers 🙄 I’m so angry and foggy and the flashbacks and nightmares have been constant due to the fact that I ran out of medicine and because no one around here takes my disorder seriously, since I’ve never seen war.

anzvfl,[TW: Suicidal Thoughts/Rape] Asking for help as the SO of a trauma victim,"Hi, I'm using a throwaway that I just kind of found on my system b/c there's a nonzero chance people will recognize my account, and I don't really want that. This is also kind of a rant, I'm half venting, and half asking for help. TW below, nothing graphic, but Rape/Suicidal Thoughts/Shitty Therapists are mentioned.

My SO was raped before we met. I met her very, very soon after, so I guess I've never known her pre-trauma. She's had a really, really difficult life before this nightmare happened, and the trauma was really just a horrific layer of icing on top of a cake that really didn't need it. We've tried therapy before. It gives her tremendous anxiety, and every time she goes she comes back worse for wear. I can't keep telling her therapy is something that will help when every time she goes, it hurts her deeply. Her first therapist actually fucking blamed her for it. Said it was because ""She got involved boys"", and that it was par for the course. Fuck them, it still pisses me off to think about it. She struggles with intimacy, and gets so upset with herself for not wanting to have sex (which is something I totally understand, and really, truly do not have problems with). She also struggles with self-image/anxiety/self-worth on a really deep level. They've confided in me recently that they really just want to die, and I'm terrified. She's mentioned it before, sometimes with intent behind her words. She says she would never act on it, swore on it even, but I'm still this nervous wreck.  


We've been together for almost two years, and I've sort of watched every step of the way as she struggled with her trauma. She's just so important to me, she's a wonderful, kind person who truly cares about others. We connect on so many levels, my life has only been improved since I met her. Right now, we're long distance for a variety of reasons, and I try to talk to her every day, even though sometimes life gets in the way. I'm so afraid of losing her, and I just don't know what to do to help.

I tell her I love her every day, because, well, I do. I just wish I could take some of the burden off of her shoulders. She struggles with enough already. But at the same time, I know I can't. In multiple ways, it's not possible for me to carry this burden for her. What should I say to her? Is there anything I can do to help?

Thank you for reading this far.

The downside is that I had to place my 1.5 relationship on pause which of course, isn't going well. Today I felt better, I checked out two books on overcoming CPTSD and childhood abuse. I'm determined to recover and put this all in my past. It's just a bit tricky when there's so much darkness and so much hope looming over my head at once.

ao1bwe,Mirtazepine and what happened today,"To try and make a long story short, I went to the psych unit for a week back in November, went to partial hospitalization/intensive outpatient for a month, and was referred to a new psychiatrist clinic afterward. They diagnosed me with (nothing new with the current diagnosis of) PTSD, BPD, 3 types of anxiety disorders, insomnia, depression... finally took out the bipolar 2 diagnosis after 13 years of being misdiagnosed (3 clinicians have confirmed). However, they changed my medications AGAIN. Surprise, surprise. This was 3 weeks ago. I was put on Mirtazapine which he said would ""help"" with my marijuana usage (which i normally use only to regulate my anxiety and fibro). I was really weary begging this as i read all of the negative side effects, and I've had quite the opposite. Severe nausea, my PTSD symptoms have worsened, i refuse to even smoke since starting it. My second visit with him, i asked him why he said it would ""help"" with marijuana use and he said the long term effects of marijuana use has had some studies that have had shown signs of dementia. Then said he wanted me to up my dose of mirtazapine to 30mg from 15mg and THEN said i need to see a social worker because i have been hospitalized more than 10 times, more than 2 lethal suicide attempts, and basically kicked me out the door with no follow up care in hand. No other visit. Gave me a piece of paper with numbers to call (even though one of those numbers i have been on a waiting list for this counseling place with DBT therapy, psych services, 9 yards for over 5yrs).... said he would put in a referral. Said to call him... he woukd put in 60 day scripts. But said he normally isnt allowed to up my dose without a followup visit but go ahead and do it. Even though im not doing well. And i dont trust his word on this dementia shit. Thoughts???? I have no one to turn to besides my partner and using my CBT skills and my therapist and going through EMDR....trying not to break.

TLDR; Got prescribed a new med from a new psych after being hospitalized, then being told I'm a liability and they aren't able to provide the help i need and marijuana causes dementia. Upped meds without follow-up care.",KimAndNumbers,2019-02-06 23:32:38,5,406,70.77,32,68.5,18.51,16.92,18.97,88.42,51.72,14.04,10.84,7.39,0,0,2.71,0.74,3.2,4.93,15.76,7.39,3.45,6.16,2.96,18.97,3.2,1.72,0.99,2.96,1.23,3.45,1.48,1.97,0.49,0.25,0.25,9.85,0,0.25,0,2.71,12.56,1.97,3.2,2.46,0.99,0.49,3.94,2.46,0.25,1.97,0.25,5.67,0.49,4.93,0,0.25,5.91,1.23,1.48,3.2,0.49,0.49,7.14,7.88,1.23,15.76,3.45,5.17,7.14,2.71,0.99,0.25,0.25,0,0.49,0.74,0.25,0.25,0,0.25,0,17.98,8.13,4.43,0,0.25,0.99,0,0.25,0.99,0.74,1.97,0.25

They were pushing my head in between the glass and gun leaving my neck all sore and bruised from it. They took all my money and were going to take the car but they couldn’t drive stick. Before they left they decided to throw punches and pistol whips. I had to walk home because they took the keys to my car and my phone was almost dead.  I don’t know what to do from here. I had a spare key at home that I used to get my car but I’m really worried these people might know where I live and try to take the car again or try to break in my house.

ao8wlz,Needing advice on how to talk and approach my mother about me moving in with an online friend? I am nervous as I am moving to move away from my abuser and my mother still enabling him,"I am 24 years old and want to a start over in my life, I feel depressed and stuck in the place I live. (its so expensive and hard to find a job) I am planning to move in with an online friend and her dad that I have known for 7 years. One of the main reasons i am doing is because i have a half brother who is 35 years old and getting out of jail this year and he always been abusive to me and suspect he has some behavioral issues, i have have developed PTSD from him. I do not trust him nor my mother words that he has changed for real this time, this is the 8th time he was arrested for the same crime (drug dealing and this a possession of a gun). He is trying to behave good in jail so he can get out early. But when he gets out, he will realize he is free again and act however he wants since he doesn't have the restrictions of jail anymore. I do not want to be miserable living with him and being cautious to come home. I do not want to take any chance this time. This is something i have been talking for a while my friend. I spoke with her father as well and he told me how they will help me with finding a job( job opportunities seem to be easier there than here)/ and budget/financial concerns adjust to living with them and that state.They also told me to take a visit to them and try to see how i like it for a few weeks and if i don't like it, i can just come back here since they do not want me to feel trapped. I really am set on doing this, especially if it means i can escape living with my brother when he gets out.
I am very nervous to speak to my mother about this, because i know she will disapprove and has told me do not trust those people when i hinted it at her before. She also thinks it to far since i have to go on airplane which is hours away. I understand her concern and im nervous about it too, but this is my other option to escape from the upcoming hell my life will be. My mother wants me to help support him and her when he comes back, she tells me he is sick and full of wrinkles. I don't want to sound harsh but he had so many chances to turn around and improve himself but never did, at that point i don't think he deserves my support especially after ruining my life. Considering his record he is probably going to live with my mom for the rest of his life
I will take my precautions and if i notice anything uneasy or if i don't feel comfortable then i will think of another alternative, because i know i am not going to feel happy nor be successful if her son is there, i don't want to be surrounded by such sadness and toxicity. I do feel guilty for leaving my mother and get anxious for her (like forbid she gets sick or something and i will be states away). 
How can i feel less anxious and tell her of my decision that can put her a bit at ease? i am so incredibly nervous of the whole thing in general",starspade94,2019-02-07 13:32:59,1,624,17.02,31.54,56.33,18.67,28.36,11.54,94.07,64.26,22.44,17.47,10.42,0,0,6.25,0.8,4.97,3.21,14.26,11.06,5.93,9.94,2.4,22.12,4.33,1.44,1.6,0.8,1.28,5.61,2.56,3.04,1.44,0.48,0.64,12.18,1.92,0.48,3.21,4.97,13.3,3.69,2.08,2.24,2.88,0.64,4.01,1.92,0.16,0.48,1.28,2.08,0,2.08,0,0,5.29,1.12,1.12,0.64,2.08,0.96,1.92,17.31,2.24,12.34,3.04,4.65,4.97,0.96,0,0.16,0.64,0.16,0,0.32,0.16,0,0,0.16,0,8.01,3.04,1.92,0,0,0.32,0,0,0,1.12,1.28,0.32

My other friends are all girls I’ve met this year.

This year, I thought I was ready to date again. It had been 5 years. I had one failed relationship two years ago that increased my repressed memories and fucked me up, but I thought I could move past that.

Oh boy was I wrong. What I thought was stupid paranoia about guys pushing boundaries with no regard wasn’t stupid at all. It was real, and I was too afraid to stop it like I was in the past.

I am no longer friends with any of my straight male friends. I can’t do it for my own mental health.

I had my first major panic at the beginning of this school year. A guy who looked just like the man who assaulted me was coming on to me. I couldn’t bring myself to speak for days. I normally can’t shut up. Eventually, I broke down at a Panera and was forced into a mental hospital. It was the lowest point I thought I would go through.

I love my job more than anything. I’m terrified of my boss and male customers. My boss is the sweetest man, who only wants the best for me. I’m so afraid of him. I feel gross for being afraid; I shouldn’t be, but I can’t stop myself either.

I just wish everything could be over. I wish I could move on but this year has proved I may never be able to, because my fears are real.",rougejeans,2019-02-07 17:08:39,0,315,15.91,12.01,95.88,1,11.67,10.16,97.14,60.63,24.13,17.46,16.19,0,0,1.27,0,6.67,4.13,10.79,14.29,4.13,3.81,3.49,21.27,7.3,3.17,1.59,1.9,1.59,8.25,2.22,6.03,2.54,1.59,0.95,11.43,0,3.49,0.95,4.76,12.7,2.86,1.27,3.17,0.95,1.59,3.17,1.59,0.32,0.32,0.63,2.22,0,0.63,0.95,0.32,9.21,3.17,1.27,3.49,0.32,2.22,7.62,10.48,2.22,13.65,2.22,5.4,6.03,1.9,0.32,0,0.32,0,0,0.63,0.32,0,0,0.32,0,17.78,8.25,3.49,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0.63,4.13,0.63,0
aob6v2,I can't tell my partner what my nightmares are about,"Tw sexual assault mention 

I just got home from drinking at the student association with my partner and realized on my way home that I had a nightmare last night. It was trauma related and I got panicky in bed. They calmed me down but I can't tell them why I'm panicking at times like these. I can only tell them it was a bad dream. I did tell them, two years ago, that I got traumatized by several events that were all similar and told them what exactly (rape) but I was drunk and idk if they know it's related to those dreams.

I really wanna tell them because I really trust them but I also don't trust anyone when I'm having an episode like that. Does anyone know how I should tell them? It's important for me that they know because touch is often hard for me, even from them.

aoc3aj,"He died.... (tw-abuse, death)","So my ex died..
There’s so much to this. First off, he died in a motorcycle accident. A year after I left him, he got married and had kids. It’s been 3 years now. When I left, it was out of pure desperation. I was starving, severely anemic, covered in bruises, and I had to fight him physically to make him take me to his grandmothers to use her phone. He “got rid” of his phone. Really he’d leave the phone with someone he knew and go get drunk every night, hook up with ppl, use his phone, then come back and beat me for not wanting his std ass touching me.

It was because I would try to call someone to pick me up or I’d go to the ER and claim to be suicidal so I’d have time to try to leave to a home.....sadly you suffer alone under the Bible belt and nobody cares about you or your right to be free or at least not kicked and beaten. So anyway, I’m torn. His mom was a saint. And now she’s alone in this world with the man that made my ex the way he is. Not to mention, whether he still hits the wife and kid he has now, the daughter is without a father. 
I have to give him the benefit of the doubt, I didn’t know much about him after I left unless toxic friends of mine or his would tell me about him to ruin my day so maybe he got help. 
But the sheer fact that one of the trashiest friends he had called my father at his work to try to get my number and tell me herself, I sure hope the wife was better than letting him beat them both.
I’m happy he’s dead. It’s awful to say but it’s true. He deserved it. I hope someone that wants a child takes their kid. I hope she loses it sheerly because I almost am certain he was abusing them. I just don’t feel like people that do things like that actually change. And lord knows the next dad (and there will be one too soon) could be worse. 
I keep wanting to hate on him but I truly don’t care enough about him, good or bad to get hung up on wishing bad things or saying he got his just desserts. I’m sad for his family more than anything, much more than I am FOR HIM. And it’s just..bringing up a lot of bitterness. Sorry for the lengthy post, just had to say it because I really can’t say this anywhere else, I’m a blabber mouth but even some of my closest friends don’t know the full story.

aoggts,Do you think I have PTSD from childhood? I always thought so.This might be why I can't hold a job.,"I always wondered if I suffered from PTSD. It's either that or my own self pity. It might be both.

I have not held on to a job longer than 3 years. I am in my late 50s. 

During my hours at work, many times I replay childhood and teenage memories, that consisted of fear, frustration and anger at home, mostly from my parents. I was a slow learner and my parents (especially my father), were not equipped on how to deal with this issue. So, instead, there was much yelling and anger while trying to show me how to do things. Many times, my parents would argue with each others, as I sat between them, over how I should figure out math problems. This put a mental block in my head that I did not overcome until many years later as I struggle through college to try to fix the damage done.

I did suffer physical abuse once. My whole face was black and blue. I won't say who this physical abuse came from. The person was sorry. When a social worker at school asked about it, I made up a story. She knew I was lying. If it happened today, the police would have been called.

I was in the slow class. This brought up great anger and yelling in the household. One person who was in this slow class felt it fit to remind me I was in this class after I got my college degree. This always plays in my head while at work.

Probably the most significant issue is when I work around men and they are trying to show me how to do something, inwardly I feel I am that scared little kid who is being yelled at by his father. I believe my body language shows this, and my facial expression shows this to the man who is working with me. They do not know why I am displaying this facial expression, or this body language. All they know is I show that I am scared and I don't respect myself. As a result, they treat me as inadequate and stupid. Thus, my jobs eventually end.

That's it in a very short nut shell. Wish I could have wrote it out more clearly, but it would take too much time.  Does this sound like it might be PTSD? Is there help?

Obviously mental health issues run in my family. I have been living with generalized anxiety that leads me into periods of depression. For a long time my nightmares became less fiquent and I was thriving for one of the first times in my life, suddenly there has been a huge set back and I feel like I've lost control. My nightmares are back, anxiety through the roof, I'm so angery all the time. It is really starting to take its toll on every part of my life. I'm constantly trying to fight with my husband. The littlest things will set me off and I with blow up and then cry for hours. I struggle having the kids for a whole day by myself and feel like I'm on the edge every moment of the day. I can't seem to shake it this time it's been since before Christmas. I'm physically and emotionally exhausted and I know my husband is hitting that point also.

Every few months, I'll have a really bad episode of PTSD.

I know it sounds crazy...

I'll start to fall back into my old way of thinking: maybe I just overreacted, maybe he didn't mean it, he's going to be upset at me that I haven't talked to him/I blocked him, I should tell him I'm sorry for running away, It was all my fault anyway....

The next day, after I survive the night managing to not message him, I feel like shit. I start to second guess myself all over again. I start to tell myself I must have wanted it *because* I thought about reaching out. No one would ever *want* to reach out to someone who did what he did to you!

aoobha,Apparently I have ironic PTSD,"I started to realize I have PTSD a few weeks ago and shortly had it confirmed by a professional. Today I was in therapy and my therapist pointed out that one of my major triggers is parenting.

The thing is, all I've ever wanted in life was to have kids. I was that little girl who always talked about wanting to be a mom. People in high school called me ""Mom."" That's been my goal my whole life. And today it suddenly became clear why being a mom has been such a struggle for me. 

The thing is, I'm succeeding. I am a great mom. My house is always a mess and I'm always on the verge of being completely overwhelmed with anxiety, but I'm doing such a good job. I tend to have a hard time recognizing when I do things well, but there's no denying this. Not only am I (with tons of help from my husband) raising two intelligent, kind, and compassionate little girls, but I'm building great relationships with both of them. I don't always succeed, the anxiety and stress win out sometimes, but overall I'm doing a better job than I ever thought possible. 

I thought being a mom was almost impossibly difficult, but it turns out I'm doing it on hard mode. It's a relief to have an explanation for why I struggle so much. And now I can work on getting better. Maybe my house will even be clean one day. 

I'm not really sure why I'm posting this. I guess I'm just sort of reeling from this revelation and don't have a ton of people to talk to about this.

aooodh,My experience (caution graphic),"I’m honestly looking for someone to tell my I’m not crazy for feeling the way I do.

I was deployed to Afghanistan from September ‘17 to March ‘18.

During that time I didn’t do much. A few missions here or there that exposed me to rocket and mortar fire. Some landing as close to 100 meters (roughly a foot ball field) away.

But that’s not the moment that bothers me. To avoid giving up possibly sensitive information (truly don’t know if it would be OPSEC or not), I was a contributing factor to an air strike that killed a Taliban insurgent. Personally I feel that I am 1/3 responsible out of the whole situation. And I watched the death occur in front of me. Watching the man about to fire a PRG into friendly forces, then dissapear into a black cloud... then when the smoke clears, just a torso remains...

The thing is. Occasionally I just zone out and flashback to that moment like it’s happening all over again. I don’t feel guilty. He was about to kill 5+ friendlies. But it’s just burnt into my brain and doesn’t just stay there. It comes back randomly. And haunts me.

That and when a 15 year old afghan soldier almost shot me and my buddies in a neglegant discharge as a result of a faulty weapon. And we almost shot him.

Those two memories just resurface at random times and send me into a trance where I can’t stop thinking about them.

aop2vg,Childhood PTSD - and no one to talk to without being judged,"Hello everyone, I would like to share my traumatic childhood experience with you guys in hopes of getting judged by those I talk to about it. First things first, this is a throwaway account, and I apologize for my bad English , as it is not my first language, and I'm not the best writer out there.

A little bit of background first, I was born in 1985 in Indonesia (the country with the most Muslim citizens) to parents of Chinese descent, and I'm currently studying for my masters degree in Australia. In May 1998, when I was still 13 years old, a massive race and hate fuelled riot broke out in my country. I was living in Jakarta (Indonesia's capital city) at the time, and my big family from my mom's side all live not far from each other (family from dad's side live in a different state/province in a different island). My family were merchants, and they live off opening different kinds of shops in the city - one of my uncles owns a car workshop and spareparts store, my dad owns an electronics store, my other uncle owns a restaurant, and so on. I lived in a riverside home near the local river in an area called Glodok (which is sort of a shopping district in and of itself), and I went to a primary school not far from my house, which was a few houses down my uncle's car workshop (I'll refer to him as Uncle A from now on). 

I vividly remember I was in school when the riots broke out. I saw one of the shops near my house's area was burning,and I immediately started getting worried. I remember the teacher telling the students ""Finish whatever work you can, and go home immediately."" After I finished my work, I went home and as soon as I get home, my parents locked all the doors and windows. From my house, I can see one of my classmate's house across the river, his house was looted and his family car was burning. I also heard the masses shouting ""Kill the Chinese! Burn them alive! Loot their houses! They have no place in our Muslim country!""

When I asked my parents what was going on, they only replied with ""You wouldn't understand - this is a political issue.""

As the day goes on, I saw lots of people taking various items from the houses they looted, I saw a guy carrying a fridge on his back, and I even noticed some stuff from my uncle's car workshop getting taken.

The next day was even worse, the masses started burning the cars on my street, including my uncle's car. Many people died during the raid, and unfortunately my aunt were among the victims. She was raped before she was beaten to death and burned alive as I found out years later. 

I remembered having to carry a machete with me all the time, and taking turns with my dad watching the house entrance in case someone tries to get in. Schools were canceled until the situation died down, and it was a very traumatic experience overall.

Thankfully nothing else happened to my family, and when I returned to school some of my classmates weren't there - either dead or fled to another country.

Lately I got triggers from this traumatic event approaching my home country's presidential election, because one of the candidates is the mastermind who orchestrated the May 1998 riots. There has been a string of hate crimes towards the Chinese descents in Indonesia which I won't go into. I'm really worried about the safety of my family, and everytime I try to talk about this to a friend they judge me as being Islamophobic with the political situation in the West nowadays. I really don't know who to talk to about this without getting judged, and I hope this subreddit can give me some advice and input. Thank you very much.",hrasdg4,2019-02-08 20:41:32,8,674,76.83,34.42,92.22,10.7,22.47,18.1,91.1,53.41,16.02,12.31,9.64,0.15,0.59,0.89,1.04,3.71,7.72,15.73,6.08,4.01,6.08,1.93,14.24,4.45,2.67,1.63,1.93,2.37,3.56,1.19,2.37,0.3,0.74,0.3,9.5,2.97,0.59,0.59,2.23,7.27,1.19,0.3,0.59,2.08,0.89,2.67,2.37,0.89,0.45,0.74,1.34,0,1.04,0.15,0.15,8.16,1.93,1.48,2.82,1.78,0.59,6.53,6.82,1.19,17.51,2.37,9.64,5.64,2.67,1.63,3.26,1.04,0.45,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.13,3.71,5.19,0,0,0,0.59,0.59,0.89,2.52,1.48,0.15
aop4h6,[NSFW] Pelvic physical therapy?,"Hi, all. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD years ago after being raped and have been picking up the pieces ever since. Today I met with a gynaecologist to talk about pain I experience randomly and with intercourse. She has referred me to receive pelvic physical therapy and it's sort of freaking me out. 

I 100% plan on making and attending the appointment and will of course ask the doctor about what to expect and will share my concerns and hesitations with her. To clarify: I'm not looking for medical advice, just some support. 

I am just wondering if there is anyone who reads this sub who has had any experiences with this type of PT?",nerdner,2019-02-08 20:47:16,3,119,57,46.64,33.76,6.82,14.88,19.33,91.6,55.46,15.13,9.24,7.56,0,0,1.68,0,5.88,3.36,16.81,10.92,5.04,6.72,0.84,16.81,2.52,0.84,2.52,0.84,3.36,5.04,1.68,3.36,0.84,0.84,0,10.08,0,0,1.68,0,15.13,3.36,2.52,1.68,6.72,1.68,1.68,3.36,0.84,0,0.84,9.24,1.68,6.72,0.84,0,5.88,2.52,0.84,1.68,0,0.84,4.2,10.08,3.36,9.24,1.68,2.52,5.88,2.52,0,0,0,0,0,1.68,0.84,0.84,0,0,0,13.45,5.04,1.68,0.84,0,1.68,0,0,0,1.68,0,2.52
aop73i,Anniversary,"Hi. I’ve been using Reddit for a long time now but I’ve never really interacted with it so this is my first time- I hope I’ve gotten everything right. 

Anyways, next week is the anniversary of when my high school was shot up. It’s going to be one year. 

It’s been a really really rough year for me. I used to be perfect in academics and a social teenager but now my grades aren’t great and I’ve isolated myself.  

I lost a really good friend in the shooting and it hasn’t been the same since. I also lost my mother when I was young, so I think those losses have kind of compounded together to create one big ball of gross sadness.  I was also diagnosed with depression recently and ptsd about six months ago because of the shooting. 

This part is kind of triggering. I have never had to be scared for my life until a year ago. I have never had to worry about telling my dad goodbye forever until a year ago.  There’s a part of me gone but I’m not sure what that part is. Sometimes I’m walking to school and I smell gunpowder, sometimes I’m in Walmart and I imagine a person shooting up the place. 

It’s so hard to return to school everyday, where it happened. I see the building everyday with locks on the doors and the windows boarded up. I can’t help but think of the horror that ensued within those concrete walls. 

Lately, I’ve been pushing everyone away. I don’t know why. I don’t want to. All my loved ones have good intentions and want to help but I don’t want them to... even though I do? I feel like a burden all the time to my father because he is a single parent and doesn’t make enough money to pay for the amount of therapy and support I need.  My dad always tells me I’m not a burden but I can’t help but think I am. 

I just don’t know who to talk to anymore. There aren’t really any support groups for school shooting survivors. The school admin seems to have moved on. It all just feels so isolating. I’m just a kid. I don’t know why I have to deal with this. I wish I could reverse time and do something.

Thanks for listening to me vent. I hope whatever you’re going through gets better too, you deserve it.

aoql62,Nightmares are back,"I'm sorry this is so long 

I used to have frequently recurring trauma nightmares.

I did a lot of work with my therapist to get over them. We did one-on-one trauma therapy, and then I went through group therapy as well. In a one-on-one session with my therapist, well after I was finished with group therapy and was still having some nightmares, she told me that she used to have a recurring nightmare, too, where a monster would show up, but one day she was absolutely sick of it and told the monster ""Go away"" basically. She said that it had worked, after a few tries, and she no longer saw the monster.

So I tried it. Whenever my abuser showed up in a dream, I would tell him off in different ways - fuck you, I hate you, you're not welcome, etc., etc. He never *stopped* showing up in dreams, but I stopped being afraid, at least for a while.

About 8 months ago some things happened, and as a result I cannot see my therapist until I get those things fixed. I thought I was fine, honestly. We had cut back on sessions a bit because I seemed good, and a few times she had mentioned the possibility of graduating me (although I do remember at my last session, she had decided she wanted to try EMDR therapy).

A few nights ago, I had a very abuser-centric dream. It started off with me just being annoyed, but then every time I tried to tell him off - I was suddenly powerless. My mouth would fill up with goop and I couldn't speak. I tried and tried to spit it out and speak but I just.. couldn't. I could talk to other people in the dream fine, but as soon as I tried talking to or about him .. nothing.

The dream left me feeling really gross, and then it happened again the next night.. and I just don't know what to do at this point.

I'm absolutely terrified to go to sleep tonight. And I know, nothing that I have described is very ""nightmare""ish, but it's the tone of them, I guess.. the way they leave me feeling. I hate it.",Awkward-Octopus,2019-02-09 00:38:20,0,379,28.84,26.33,87.72,1,15.16,15.3,96.57,61.74,20.58,15.83,10.55,0.53,0.79,3.17,0.79,4.75,5.28,13.72,9.23,6.86,8.71,2.37,21.9,5.28,2.37,0.79,1.58,2.9,7.12,1.85,5.28,0.53,1.58,0.26,8.97,0,0,2.11,1.06,11.61,2.11,1.06,1.85,2.11,1.58,3.43,2.64,1.32,0.79,0.53,3.17,0.79,2.11,0.26,0,6.6,1.32,2.64,1.58,0.79,0.53,10.29,8.97,1.32,16.89,1.06,7.92,8.44,1.58,1.32,0,0,0,0,1.32,0.26,0,0.53,0.53,0,20.32,7.65,6.86,0,0,0,0,1.85,1.06,1.85,0.53,0.53

aotert,How to cope with guilt over not reporting assaulter (TW: sexual abuse),"I was raped when I was twelve by a person I did not know. After the event I tried to pretend like it never happened and moved on with my life. Over the next couple years my mental health quickly deteriorated, and I eventually told a friend of mine what had happened.

It's been five years since I told that friend and soon after confided in my family, but there's always the nagging thought in the back of my head that by not reporting him I could have allowed him to hurt others. It feels like that fear has been growing in intensity of late.

Being it seven years since the trauma, I don't think there's much anyone could do about it. So I'm left here just ruminating on the terrible things that could and might have happened. And all of the people I may have allowed him the opportunity to hurt.

I recently started seeing a second therapist to focus on processing the trauma, so hopefully that will help me with this and with the other symptoms. But I thought I might as well reach out to you all to see if you had any thoughts or things that helped you cope with or get past these thoughts.

aotret,Could I have PTSD?,"Before I'll start I want to mention that I don't intend to insult anyone that suffers from ptsd.

So after I've read a lot about ptsd I realised that I suffer from some of the symptoms of ptsd. However the 'problem' is that I can't tell if my traumatic experience was 'enough' to let me suffer from ptsd. I should also mention that I suffered from chronic depression for a long time and that I still suffer from anxiety. So it could be that the symptoms are from these illnesses rather than ptsd.

As I already said I'm not sure if my traumatic experience is 'enough' to trigger ptsd. The main reason why I think that is because whenever I read stories from people that suffer from ptsd they had to experience really awful things that can't be compared to what I experienced. So I kinda feel like I'm a bad person if I just diagnose myself for what I experienced while other people had to live through way worse things.


So here's what I think might have been a trigger for my possible ptsd:

Some years ago I was playing soccer in a good team where only the best of the country could play. I had chances to eventually become a professional player. At the time I was only 11 years old however the pressure from the coaches and the soccer club in general was almost unreal. We had a list of foods which we should and shouldn't eat. I wasn't allowed to go to skiing holidays with my family because the risk of getting injured was too high. We had about 6 times training per week and whenever someone misbehaved the punishment was getting screamed at and doing push ups. And with 'misbehaved' I mean not looking at the coach or not having your hands behind your back while he was talking. For us 11 year old kids this was quite extreme. Everyone was somehow friends but behind the back there was always this envy and fear that the teammates could take your place in the start formation and stuff like that.

All this pressure from the teammates, parents who wanted their kids to be stars and also from school was simply too much for some of my former teammates. Crying kids before, after or during the training became a normal thing.

Then after I played there for about two years I suddenly got the message that they don't want me to play there anymore. It was a huge shock and the message came out of nowhere. I didn't really know what to feel/do when I got the message. Everything I worked for since I was 4 years old was suddenly gone. My whole world collapsed that day. I locked myself in my room for some weeks or even months (I can't really remember). Shortly after that, my parents divorced and my grandmother died. I somehow couldn't shed one single tear even though I was really close to my grandmother. I was just so numb.

Some time later I became really depressed and got suicidal thoughts. I had nightmares about this topic for a long time. It was just too much for my 12 year old self. My anxiety got stronger and stronger and I wouldn't talk with anyone if I wasn't asked something or spoke directly to. My whole life felt like a film. It felt like my body wasn't even my body. I had trouble focusing on things and my thoughts were a mess in general.

Before all that happened I was a extroverted and a joyful person. I was quite cheeky and had a lot confidence. Now I am very anxious, introverted and people always tell me that I look really exhausted and depressed. It's like I'm a whole different person after all that happened.

Now after 5 years I can't remember a lot of the things that happened back then. It seems like my brain has deleted most memories. 

So my question is: Could I have ptsd and should I seek professional help?",OnlyLongComments,2019-02-09 08:24:15,6,684,24.95,18.23,88.06,1.52,15.91,16.37,93.86,61.11,19.59,12.28,10.67,0.58,0.44,0.15,0.44,7.31,5.7,12.13,10.38,8.48,7.31,2.49,18.86,4.24,3.8,1.61,1.32,2.63,6.29,1.61,4.68,1.02,0.44,1.46,7.89,0.88,0.15,0.29,0.15,15.79,2.92,1.32,2.92,4.53,1.61,4.82,2.19,0.29,0.44,0.73,2.34,0.88,1.32,0,0.29,5.99,2.49,1.02,1.61,1.46,0.73,8.77,7.89,0.73,12.72,0.58,4.24,8.33,1.46,2.49,0.29,0,0,0.29,0.15,0,0.15,0,0,0,11.7,5.99,0.58,0.29,0,0.29,0,0,0,4.09,0.29,0.15

aouguc,What to do when your panick attack is real.,"Hi, I'm transgender and Im dealing with panick attacks related to feeling unsafe in the idea of being abandoned by my family again after already being abandoned before by my father at 18, leading to my PTSD. I don't know how to deal with the aftermath of my panick attacks or how to make them stop. It is very hard for me to separate reality from my panick attacks since the concern of being abandoned is very real, due to the fact that my mom isn't accepting. 

I know for most people they have flashbacks of past events, which I used to have, but ever since it seems history is repeating itself for me, I panick about the very real reality of having no one. I can't tell myself it isn't real cause it is. I can't tell myself I'm safe, cause I'm not.

aovmyp,Finding happiness in your struggle,"I just watched Season 3 of this great show called One Day at a Time which I highly recommend. One of the characters has PTSD too. So it's relatable. But the last episode talked about finding happiness in your accomplishments rather another person. 

I am a rape survivor. I have been walking in a pitch black tunnel of depression for almost 3 years. I have had 3 attempts on my life. I've seen the inside of the psychiatric hospital twice. I spent last summer in residential treatment.

But this tunnel I speak of is is one you all probably know of. It's pitch black, no light. You walk in a direction not even knowing if you are walking closer or farther from the exit. Sometimes you want to sit on your ass, starve yourself of hope and die there. I was at that point. I was at rock bottom. 

During my last attempt on my life, I was actually the one who picked up the phone and dialed 911. Because while I felt dying was the only way to take away the unbearable feelings of shame, there was still a part of me that wanted to desperately live. After my attempt, I began to cherish my life like nothing else. I remember having the delusion that my mom was going to stab me in my sleep, so I locked myself in the bathroom and slept on the floor. I remember I was on the metro in Portland and a man came in holding a briefcase and I was convinced there was a bomb, and with panic got off the train. One night, I remember it so vividly I realized that my life could be taken at any moment, and I would die with regret knowing I wasted time not doing the things I love. I remembered a dream in the back of my head of doing the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), a 2,650-mile hiking trail along the Pacific coast from Canada to Mexico. And there and then I finally saw a flicker of light at the end of the tunnel. 

When I set this goal I was barely making it out of bed to go to treatment, let alone hike up a mountain with a backpack. But no matter where I was on my journey to healing I saw that light and I walked towards it. It started with baby steps, and later turned into miracle like leaps. Today I have held a job down for the longest in my life. Going on 6 months. After isolating myself out of fear for 2 years I have 2 friends I hang out with regularly. I have finally found the medication that works, and allows me to remain stable. I exercise 3-4x a week. I have a handle on my drinking. But most importantly I have my hard copy permit to do the PCT. 

I realize by even just stepping foot on this trail I am giving PTSD the big middle finger. I am telling it that it no longer runs my life. And while there are days where I still struggle, I think I can honestly say I'm out of the tunnel. Not meaning that I am cured of PTSD, but that I have the hope and the skills to make it through the next tunnel. Because as you may know, PTSD is not a linear recovery. It is up and down, and all over. But I'm prepared to accept this and ride this rollercoaster with confidence. 

I want to write this out because recently I was dumped by a woman I was dating, who I really liked and it's hard. Like any human, I wanted connection and affection. I wanted it to make me happy. But I realize now that I can find happiness in myself. I tried for a while to find a savior, but when no one could fulfill that expectation I had to be my own hero. And I saved myself. And that is the ultimate love and happiness for myself.",OddEggplant,2019-02-09 11:26:57,6,682,60.29,14.55,97.82,47.46,14.21,13.49,90.03,59.38,18.62,13.34,12.02,0,1.32,0,0,5.28,7.18,14.81,8.06,4.69,6.6,1.32,17.45,2.93,2.2,1.03,2.49,1.03,4.69,2.93,1.76,0.88,0.15,0.59,4.25,0.29,0.15,0.29,0.15,10.7,3.23,1.32,2.05,1.76,0.59,2.64,2.79,1.61,0.44,0.73,3.23,0.88,1.61,0.15,0.29,4.4,0.59,1.32,2.05,1.03,0,6.6,8.65,1.17,17.3,2.64,8.94,5.87,1.17,1.17,0.44,0.15,0,0.44,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0,11.44,6.89,3.08,0,0,0,0,0.29,0,0.88,0.29,0

When I took a semester abroad, for some strange reason I still can't figure out, I started having this flashbacks about being abused and they were all consistent with things I thought happened a long time ago. I am a male and I was abused by my biological father (Neglect, Verbal and Sexual Abuse) [Also, Wow! It's incredible how writing that felt].
After returning to my home country I looked for assistance. And after a couple of failed tries with other doctors I finally settled down with my two actual ones: a therapist and a psychiatrist. Right now, both know what happened to me and how it affected me. They both diagnosed PTSD and Major depression. It's been 2 years since I started the treatment and I feel amazing now. I can even say way better than before remembering all this stuff. Now I'm questioning myself about, Why I couldn't remember all this?

TLDR: My memory repressed the abuse memory and now that it came out, after starting treatment, I feel amazing.

aowew5,Triggered during work training,"I am starting a job as an ABA behavior tech, and I couldn't be more excited. I have some online training courses I have to complete in order to start, and the oddest thing happened. I was reading about Domestic Violence which, of course, includes sexual abuse. There was a tab I had to reach about what constitutes sexual abuse. When I did, I felt all the blissful-dreamy-stress response pool into my head. Now my eyes are glazing over more than usual, my thoughts are louder, and everything is farther away. I have never tracked a trigger response so clearly. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone right now. I don't trust my words, I know my stutter is going to come out and I feel too disconnected. But I look fine, and that gives me some happiness.

It's so stupid that I've been battling PTSD for months now and I am still surprised when I have a trauma response. That whole minimizing your pain and denial stuff is too real. It just sneaks up on ya.

I'm going to try and power through this even though I know it will result in a bad night as my flashbacks are delayed. But I care about this job, I am happy that I am actually DOING things and I know that soon I won't be able to anything. I am going to ride this burst of productivity out as long as I can.

aoylzc,I'm starting to think that my fear of water may be PTSD,"Hi this post will be very long so be patient. Also I'm not an english native speaker and I'm writing this in a very bad mood so I forgive in advance for my errors.  
Even though I swim regulary twice a week for 6 years I still fear water. I started swimming because 7 years ago, at the age of 9, I had a near-drowning experience in the swimming pool of my best friend's house. If I'm alive, it's thanks to his father. I remember kinda vividly the experience but I don't want to trigger anyone so I'll be brief. Basically I was already scared of water to begin with (I even had both the rubber wing and water wings on) but after a long time I decided to remove every protection to stay on the raft but my friend dived on it and i fell in water. I was drowing and after my friend's failed attempt to rescue me I eventually surrendered and let water in my lungs. As you know I woke up (I don't remember where) but since then I did feel terribly, I was always thinking about my ""death"", crying, nightmares and I couldn't interact with my best friend because I would remember it and that resulted in me destroying our super big friendship, that was even my only one friendship; I still feel bad about it. I have very good parents but unfortunately they don't know anything about mental health in general and so they stigmatize every mental disorder as being ""mad"" and without the ability to think rationale so you can guess the result of my request of going to the doctor because I did feel terrible. Of course his son it's not mad! One year later they decided that to cure my fear of water needed to be cured so began to take swimming lessons. I now thank them for it but at the time it made me worse than before. I literally cried in silence for the whole lessons pretending it was the water of the pool coming down my face. Year by year this ""fear"" cured itself and now can even enjoy swimming a little bit. I don't have nightmares nor I constantly think about my traumatic experience (even if sometimes I have flashbacks that last a few seconds) but I do have some strong anxiety some hours prior to swimming. In water I have anxiety with flashbacks for about 20 minutes and the last 40 I hardly have any and I can even enjoy swimming. I cannot stay submerged for more than 1 second without feeling I'm drowning if I don't have my goggles on or for more than 10 seconds if I do have my goggles on. Two years ago I discovered the existence of PTSD and I do have a feeling that I may have it. No person in the world (except this subreddit now) knows any of this, my parents think that I'm fine and I don't fear water anymore. This week was super tough for my, my friend had a panic attack in front of me and my diabetic friend had a crisis also in front of me and now I feel like some mild form of my 9 years old without flashbacks and I'm on the verge of a breakdown. I don't know what to do honestly, I don't know how to deal with this mood and for my ""diagnosis"" I was thinking of going to a psychiatrist when I turn 18 because I don't want to open up to my parents about this.

ap0yun,I never really talked to anyone about this (TW- Victim blaming(?)),"I was diagnosed with PTSD about a year ago, from my bullying as well as PTSD from being groomed and tricked by a pedophile online and doing other things I'm not comfortable discussing right now. Either way, for the second PTSD thing I used to talk about it a lot. I'm not sure why, I think it may have been my form of accepting what happened. And it got to the point where my family started to blame me for what happened.

 I was standing in the kitchen with my brother talking to him about it and out of no where he gets irritated with me and tells me it was my fault I didn't see what he was doing and got in the car with him in the first place. And deep down I guess I agree. I was 14 or 15 at the time and I should've known better. Was it really my fault? I'm still not sure. I'm at that point where I don't trust people like I used to.

ap0zv3,I feel like I’m regressing.,"I’ve never posted on here before. Actually, I’ve never posted anywhere on reddit before; I mainly just read and empathize with others. But I need help. 

I was stalked. My ex boyfriend, who I only dated for a few months, stalked me for 18 months after I broke up with him. I was a senior RA at my college at the time so I lived on campus (free housing and meal plan!), and he would sit in the dining halls, lobbies, and wait for people to leave  my hall and catch the door to shove letters and jewelry under my door. He tried to pick my lock with a bobby pin at 2am. He would show up unexpectedly, everywhere. When I escaped to my parents’ house for the summer, he drove 8 hours, across state lines, and sat outside my house until I got home from work. Refused to leave until I threatened to call the police. I DIDNT CALL THE POLICE. That is one of my biggest regrets. 

When I came back to campus in the fall, I was having panic attacks almost daily. Couldn’t be in my room without the door locked and furniture pushed in front of it. Saw the free campus therapist, wasn’t helping, ran out of sessions. Jumpy, hypervigilant, exhausted all the time, numb. Dazed. Paralyzed.  I think a part of me has been paralyzed since two years ago when it all started. 

Flash forward six months. He showed up to my best friend’s birthday party (she wanted to go bar hopping). He pretended not to see me, but he was there. Within 10 feet. My skin was crawling. He was wearing a pink patterned shirt; it looked awful. How come I can remember exactly what shirt he was wearing that night, but I can’t remember the order things happened the day he showed up at my parents’ house?

He graduated college, moved back to his hometown a couple hours away. I felt like I could breathe again. Breathe with a weight on my chest, but breathe at least a little. I could go study at coffee shops again. I could go out to my favorite bar once every couple months, wearing all black, keeping my blonde hair hidden, staying in the shadows. A nice man, a genuinely nice man who loves his mom and has the most positive energy and treats me better than any male has ever treated me before, fell in love with me. I opened myself up to the possibility of falling in love with him too. 

This past summer. July 2018. He somehow left a voicemail on my phone, at first it could have been “mistaken”as a butt dial when I heard him introducing himself to someone, but then there was over a minute of footsteps and heavy breathing—even though his number is blocked, even though there were no missed calls on my phone. I finally called the police, filed a police report, detailed everything that had happened over the past 18 months. Police couldn’t figure out how the voicemail got on my phone. I decided to file for a restraining order. Got the temporary one. Got to court, saw him for not even 3 seconds through a window. He stared right at me. It was all he wanted, to be near me again. I froze. I couldn’t. I couldn’t do it. I backed out. He walked. 

I found out five weeks ago that he had moved back to the city I will be living in until at least August. He’s working for the Democratic Party of (state we live in)—apparently they hired him even with the record of having a restraining order filed against him. 

It’s been, what, 6 months since I saw him in court? When I knew he wasn’t here, I felt better. Not okay, because he still knows what city I live in, but at least I knew he had a job in another city that he was probably at, so I could leave the security of my locked apartment without gripping my bottle of Xanax in one hand and my individually-dyed canister of pepper spray in the other. Since I found out he moved back, I feel like I’ve regressed back to almost two years ago when he had dropped out of school to stalk me full time. I’ve been consistently hypervigilant, needing to sit both where I can see everyone who comes into a building and be close to an exit, terrified by white men with blond buzzcuts and khakis. Locking my bedroom door and pushing furniture in front of it. I can’t focus on hospital applications for shit. (they’re due in 5 weeks and I’ve barely started). A knock on the door or unknown number on my phone sends me to the verge of a panic attack. 

I finally made the leap to see a psychiatrist last week. I was officially diagnosed with PTSD, had meds switched and added, and am maybe 30% of the person I was before all this happened. The adderall helps me focus on internship applications, prazosin helps me sleep without the nightmares and cold sweats, antidepressants switched and increased. I’m hopeful that, in time, they will help, or my psychiatrist will find the right combo. Until then, what the FUCK do I do? How do I cope with this regression of symptoms? These next five weeks are literally the most important of my life. These applications determine whether or not I get an internship, which is required for me to pass my certification exam and officially receive those coveted letters after my name. I do not have TIME for PTSD. I do not have time to feel re-traumatized by various triggers every day.

ap1drr,Hard time,"Its been 7 years and I’m finally telling people what happened to me for the first time. I’m moving forward with police.

The day after I finally opened up, I was diagnosed with PCOS. There is a chance I will never have children of my own. So I’m going through a lot, and my friends know this. Some have been more supportive than others, and I was expecting that. No one really knows what to say to me and I understand. I wouldn’t want anyone to be able to relate. 

Not too long ago I was talking to friends in our group chat and was complaining about work (we all work together). One of my friends launches into a thing about how I’m always complaining and that I don’t ever try, and that if I just tried harder I would be a better employee. 

As I’m writing this, I’m getting a huge barrage of notifications both from the group chat and from the people in it individually. She had her wisdom teeth removed and is on painkillers but I went to see her yesterday and she was lucid enough to know what she was talking about and not misspeak. 

And it hurt, so bad. I know I’ve been cranky, I know I’ve complained a lot but I haven’t lashed out at my friends, and I’ve been reaching out to open up to them and ask for support. I have a job that makes me want to kill myself and all of my spare time is wrapped up in dredging up evidence for my case. I’m exhausted and haven’t been eating or leaving my house except to work at a job that treats us all like slaves. 

It hurt more than I thought it would. She’s been cold to me all day (I told her last night) and initially she was incredibly supportive but I don’t know what changed in her and I feel like I’m losing my support circle. 

On the upside, I’ve been reading “Option B,” a book about moving on after horrible life events, and it’s been incredibly helpful. It focuses mostly on the aftermath of the author’s spouse’s passing, but the things she talks about can be relatable in a lot of different contexts.",mkgstat,2019-02-09 22:08:52,2,379,30.14,25.46,90.94,14.78,18.05,15.3,93.67,60.69,21.11,15.3,11.61,0.79,0,2.64,0.26,5.8,4.75,15.3,12.66,4.49,7.65,2.37,22.43,4.22,3.17,1.32,1.06,3.43,4.49,1.85,2.64,0.26,0.26,0.79,10.82,0.26,1.06,2.64,0,14.51,3.43,1.06,1.85,2.9,1.85,4.22,2.37,0.53,0.26,1.58,1.32,0.26,0.79,0,0.26,8.97,3.69,2.37,2.37,0.53,0.53,6.07,13.19,0.79,14.25,2.64,6.6,5.54,2.64,0.79,0.26,0,0,0.26,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,0,15.57,5.28,3.17,0,0,0,0,0,0.53,5.54,1.06,0

ap2urf,"(TW: CSA, sex, kind of a rant) I feel disgusting for feeling the way I do, I want it to stop","Context: 19 y/o trans man, was raped at age 7. have PTSD from a combo of that + physical abuse throughout my childhood. Not getting any sort of therapy or help aside from my partner's support.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel super gross writing this, but its been on my mind too long and I need to get it out.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, when me and my partner have PIV sex, I get flashbacks to when I was raped. Most of the time, I ask to stop straight away, because I'm extremely uncomfortable, remembering it makes me upset, etc. And my partner is incredibly supportive and helps comfort me. But lately I've been feeling different about it. Almost like I'm sexualising that sense of fear and lack of consent. Like I enjoyed what happened. Which makes me feel disgusting- it was horrible and traumatic and yet I'm not immediately repulsed when I get flashbacks during sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had other reactions similar to this before too, like being aroused after remembering what happened, stuff like that. While I'm fine with consenting adults having their fantasies, this is something I never want to explore, and I never want to feel like that again.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a youtube video explaining why people have kinks etc, basically saying our first sexual experiences have a huge role in what we're into. And since I've always been submissive in the bedroom, I'm scared that being raped permanently affected who I am today. I know logically that at that age, there was no way for me to consent or ask for it to happen, I didn't enjoy it, etc. So why is it coming up now? I don't know what to do. I feel disgusting just writing this, hell I never talk about what happened except with my partner, and even then I only go into detail sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do now? How do I stop having the wrong response to remembering something so horrible? Or better yet, how do I stop myself from thinking about it at all when I have sex? I'm sure that my partner doesn't want to have to look after me every time it happens, and we'd both be better off if I could just put the past behind me. I'm guessing I'm gonna need therapy, but I'm disabled, cant work, and my income is just what I get from the government. Which barely covers living. I only got therapy when I was forced by my foster parents (tl;dr they were almost as bad as my bio parents), who didn't make me pay for food, only rent / internet etc.

&amp;#x200B;

ap558p,I am at a loss,"It's been a rough few weeks and I've been posting a lot and I'm sorry, I just don't have anywhere else to turn.

My partner is having a rough go right now and not only am I at a loss of what to do, I'm scared for him and for us. Everything I say gets twisted and he's pulling away from me more and more all while saying I don't listen or respect him.  I am trying to give space, to ask questions for clarity, to remind him i'm here and i'm trying, to ask what he needs, to not raise my voice, to not engage when he yells. We just keep circling around back to stonewalling.  I know he's not going to be able to really hear me until he's come down a bit from being anxious and symptomatic but I dont know what to do in the interim. I feel like i'm losing him. I know he wants to get better but this shit keeps happening. Mostly I just tiptoe around my house or cry inmy car. 

I also have this part of my brain that knows this has nothing to do with me but I watch him be kind to our dogs and ignore me and it breaks my heart.

ap5aqk,How do I handle my moms PTSD rage episodes?,"A little back story. I’m a female in my twenties currently living with my mom and younger siblings. My mom has PTSD from living with my father who has antisocial and narcissistic personality disorder. I struggle with the traumas myself but aren’t diagnosed with PTSD.

My mom is extremely easily triggered by others behavior, and her episodes or outbursts are often emotionally and verbally abusive. I struggle to handle her rage often, because it triggers memories of the verbal/emotional abuse from her I’ve gone through. 
Don’t get my wrong, my mom is an amazing loving mom, and she doesn’t mean to harm anyone, but sometimes she does.

Her biggest issue is feeling used, unappreciated,  not good enough due to how my father treated her. The issue is everything can trigger that. Yesterday there was an issue with our car and me asking if she was sure she pressed the right button caused her to scream at me in the middle of a public parking lot. It’s always about how “we” just think she’s nothing, and we’re all better than her even though she does everything for us and no one is ever thankful. She’s also extremely paranoid and will turn everything into something it’s not. 

I don’t know how to handle it. At this point I’m so frustrated, both because I know she can’t help it and because I feel like she’s trying to play the victim of everything. She seems to think it’s okay because she’s standing up for herself, but often she’s not. She’s irrational and jumping to conclusions that doesn’t really make sense.

Is there anything I can do to either stop it from escalating, calm her down or get it to stop somehow? When she’s angry about someone outside the household I try to explain that maybe x didn’t do y to make her feel bad, or maybe she’s feeling like she’s being mistreated because it reminds her of something else, not because she’s actually being mistreated.
Any tips would be appreciated.

Also moving out isn’t an option right now for financial reasons and due to me being disabled and dependent on her help.

It's a hard dream to explain, but it's the only dream I can recall having a direct relation to my trauma. I can't really remember it, but I remember seeing his face as clear as day; for the longest time when I thought of his face all I could do was draw up a fuzzy haze, but I saw him 100% clear in that dream. I remember reporting him for the rape of someone else (just in the dream, he only abused me) and then I found him hanging in his room.

ap7bnx,Need for approval,"Growing up, my best friend was emotionally and sexually abusive (we were friends from around at 3 or 4 to 15). I've been in abusive friendships and and a relationship since then. Currently just trying to avoid toxic people as much as I can and work on myself in therapy.

My self esteem is awful. I don't actively hate myself, but deep down I don't feel good about the person I am. Growing up, my best friend made it very clear what she did and didn't like about me. I was allowed to wear certain things and not allowed to wear others. I had to keep my legs shaved because I was gross otherwise. Even though she's gone, I feel like I need people's approval. I live with my parents and if they don't like my outfit or hair or anything like that, I really struggle. They aren't nasty and everyone is allowed to have an opinion - but hearing a negative opinion triggers me. I grew up being manipulated into ignoring what I wanted, so if someone says they don't like how I dress or something like that, I struggle to brush it off.

My birthday is coming and I want to get my septum pierced. I'm an adult and I can do this. My parents have said I can; they hate septum piercings but they aren't going to tell me I can't get one. So I should be fine with that. But I'm struggling. I really want this piercing and I want to work on my self confidence (I've been forcing myself to dress how I want more and more despite feeling like people might judge me), so...while it makes me REALLY anxious, I'm thinking it might be a good thing. Like an exposure therapy thing almost, to get something I know my parents dont like and do it anyway

Does anyone else understand these feelings? I feel so bad because my parents love me but sometimes when I get triggered, they get frustrated and feel like they can't share their opinions. I value their opinions. But I don't want them to rule my life because of past trauma. (Also opinions on whether or not getting a piercing that they don't like and taking that step is an good idea would be appreciated.)",risingsun1999,2019-02-10 11:27:08,1,388,5.75,6.11,88.96,39.6,16.17,18.04,94.33,62.63,24.23,17.78,14.18,0.26,0,0.52,2.84,6.44,2.32,11.34,11.6,5.15,11.86,3.87,21.65,3.09,3.35,1.55,1.03,0.77,9.02,4.9,4.12,1.29,1.55,0,9.79,1.03,0.77,0.52,0,20.62,2.84,3.61,3.09,4.9,1.03,7.47,2.84,0.26,0.77,1.8,2.58,0.77,1.29,0.26,0,11.34,2.84,1.55,4.64,3.35,0.52,3.87,16.49,1.29,7.47,1.8,3.61,2.06,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0.26,17.27,6.44,2.84,0,0.26,0.26,0,0.26,0,5.67,1.55,0
ap7jvz,"I just want to complain about my entire life, if that's okay","I don't know if my life was / is worse than anyone elses. It's not a competition, i know that. I just feel like my brain, my self, was fucked from the get go. 

I was traumatized when I was 13, sexually abused by a male friend of mine. I am straight, and it messed up my whole psyche. I feel like my entire life stemmed from that. Anxiety, stress, the nightmares and ptsd. I very quickly turned to sex, drugs, and alcohol to cope with my misery. 


Even before then it was like my brain was programmed by society to be a binger. Go to school all week, hate it, then watch cartoons all Saturday and explode my dopamine in joy. Rinse, repeat. I'm not blaming that as the core of my problems, but I really don't think it helped?

After 13, I turned to binging on drugs, alcohol, and sex. Years and years of rotating vices. Finally alcohol really did a number on me, in my 20s, and I got sober and tried to work on myself.

Now I am 27, and I live my life more sober than I ever have. Starting back when I was 13, I can't remember a solid month I didn't do a substance (maybe even a week). I was pretty fucked up for about 14 years, give or take. 

Now, it's like I'm playing catch up. I have to live life on lifes terms, and my PTSD is more real than ever sober. It's the core of all my problems. The trauma. The nightmares.


I really feel for people who have to go through this shit. It's fucking horrible. It's not easy. Some people are just not going to have that good of life, no matter what you say. I don't mean to sound so sorry for myself. I have night terrors regularly, sometimes once or twice a week. Have had them since I was 15 on and off. I find the only thing that cures them is smoking weed, and that's illegal in my state and my employer drug tests. 


I don't drink anymore, but the pain stays the same. What pisses me off more is I know there's plenty of others with my same story. Finding a recipe to have your life not be complete crap takes a ton of work. I go to therapy once a week, I did rehab, I don't do any illegal substances for the most part. Yet my life still just won't get better.

I realize though, it's not about that, it's about fighting for it to get easier and make yourself better. But it's a life long battle. There's no clear goal or finish line.

ap9q1s,Mental illness or abuse?,"So basically my life story: From ages 3-11 I was raped, beaten bloody, starved, and practically psychologically and physically tortured by my family. I've been diagnosed with ptsd, panic disorder, gad, mdd, ednos, unspecified sleep disorder, and am being tested for bpd. Now that we're all caught up; one big abuser was my father. I still live with him, along with my brother, my father's girlfriend, and her two sons. Now, I had repressed all of my trauma tightly until I was 12, when I admitted I was raped (long story). I went to court and shit, yada yada yada, and my mental health crashed. I began to remember everything I pushed back, everything I hid from. I never really trusted my dad, I think, but only my subconscious looked into that until my memories came flooding back. I'm terrified of him, everything about him. His voice, his breathing, the sound of his steps in his steel toed boots hes always wearing and his chain wallet clinking, his smell... it immediately puts me on edge. A reminder: I live with him. If he gets even the slightest bit angry I get flashbacks and panic attacks. But he gets angry at me that i dont trust him. Gets angry that I cant ""move on"" and saying I'm just ""hiding in the past"" and ""getting joy from my misery.""

apbc49,"my ex publicly shamed me for being diagnosed with c-ptsd after out toxic relationship ended and his post is still haunting my dreams, how dumb is that?","a friend of mine messaged him about it (she had no vile intentions i hope, but i cant be sure) and then he made around 6 or 7 memes that basically said that i am lying since i cant get ptsd from a relationship and posted them on his instagram stories

after he posted the memes he uploaded another story where he was looking very content with his actions that said something in the lines of ""I am having way too much fun with this"", obviously referring to the previous stories.

he was the first person i've ever loved and even though i have received therapy from both a psychiatrist and a psychologist and i've been prescribed fluoxetine it killed me from the inside to see that he publicly showed this kind of disgusting behavior and like in the past he made me question my own sanity and diagnosis (he gaslighted me a lot)

i am afraid to talk about this with my friends because i dont wanna sound like those ""you made fun of my mental illness"" memes but it really did affect me. i know that no matter what i say he is going to publicly twist my words like he always does.

he made me feel like i am experiencing trauma for attention and for some goddamn reason i cant get it off my head, like his opinion is the only legit one because it is the one i dont want to hear

ive made so much progress this past couple of months mainly because i have such caring friends, i even got into a new relationship that is so healthy, honest and wonderful it makes me realise how badly he treated me all this time. But seeing me again like this (heart palpitations, cant sleep, nightmares, puking, flashbacks out of nowhere especially when im having fun, suicidal thoughts) discourages me so much

it stresses me so much that i cant keep avoiding our hometown forever and ill have to go back for easter break, luckily i moved for uni as soon as this whole mess happened and it really helped me but the thought that i might see him, his family or his asshole friends literally stresses me out to the point of vomiting

the situation also triggered my anorexia (that I thought was gone but nnnnope) and as a result the pills i was described messed up badly with my stomach and i was forced to stop taking them, but i guess it was a bad idea after all",Erinto,2019-02-10 18:09:30,12,451,22.59,27.48,60.63,4.97,75.17,17.07,92.9,59.2,23.06,16.41,10.86,0.22,0.22,4.66,0.44,6.65,4.43,11.75,7.76,6.21,8.43,2.22,16.41,3.99,2.66,1.11,1.11,2.66,7.32,2.66,4.66,1.11,1.33,0.22,10.86,0.22,0.89,0.22,4.43,14.63,2.66,3.99,0.67,2.88,2,3.55,2.66,1.11,1.11,0.22,3.77,1.11,2.44,0,0.44,5.32,2.66,0.44,0.67,0.89,0.67,6.43,9.09,1.33,10.86,1.77,3.99,5.1,0.22,1.33,0.22,0,0,0.44,1.11,0.67,0,0,0,0,7.54,0.89,3.1,0,0,0.22,0,0.22,0.89,0.44,1.77,0

I remained friends with his parents on Facebook for some time after, but eventually deleted them because the content they were posting was triggering PTSD anxiety and flashbacks.

apg1mq,"Invited to my abusive big brother’s wedding, family pushing me to attend | TW: sexual abuse","The primary source of my C-PTSD is my older brother. In 2013, I came out to my family about the abuse. While initially supportive, my mom ultimately has taken the side of my brother. 

Despite admitting to sexually abusing me, he tried to minimize the situation by likening it to “playing doctor”. This is essentially a blatant lie as he was plenty old enough to know what sex was and groomed me for it as well. As far as I know, my brother hasn’t disclosed to his fiancée.

Because of this, my mother has made it her life’s mission to get me to bond with him and will not respect my wishes. It would be so easy to cut her out of my life, it is never that simple.  Not only has she provided some support through my grad school career, she has pledged to help me with my own wedding. 

Also, I love my mom. Our relationship sucks sometimes, but I’m bonded to her and I don’t want to lose her. 

I’m stressed because I have the constant reminders/triggers of my brother (literally in the mail— he got my address from my mom and has sent me invites/save the dates) and this enormous pressure from my mom to be at his wedding and invite him to mine. 

I need some support/advice/encouragement.

I can fucking feel it. But I’m making it up? It makes me hate myself and I can’t be close to my fiancé but yes I’m totally making something that serious up for no reason. 

She diagnosed me with ptsd for other abuse that I more vividly remember (within the last 3 years rather than 14 years ago) but won’t believe me on this when I told her soon after I ‘recovered’ the memory. 

What if I am imagining it? Then why does it feel real? Why do I remember it? I wasn’t going to press charges regardless, I didn’t for the others, I just wanted to get it off my chest and I’m not believed.

apjvfy,Just found out I’m pregnant,"As the title says I just found out I’m pregnant, with my second child and I have some mixed emotions. On the one hand I’m happy, I won’t lie and say I love babies because they are so much work but I love my daughter to pieces and I love she gets to have a sibling. I think it would be so beneficial for her. 

However having CPTSD and being in the process of working on it it feels kind of worrying. The first time I didn’t know I had PTSD, I entered therapy when my daughter was about 6 months old and she’s now 3. Things in my life are far more stable than they were then which is great. My husband is by far the most understanding and supportive person I know. 

I think my fear comes from remembering how hard the infant stage was on my mental health. But I try to remind myself I didn’t know all the things I do know and I was not in a healthy frame of mind then that I have vastly improved on. Of course there’s always room for more improvement.

I think the great fear is going from no kids to one is not the same as going from one kid to two. All the other parents say it’s hell and it’s freaking me out!

apk6u2,where do I even start?,"I’m 19 and a sophomore in college and I just came out as a lesbian. I’ve been loosely diagnosed with several things by several counselors and therapists, none of whom were ever reliable or supportive. Some of whom should honestly be fired for malpractice. But 9/10 of them agreed I have PTSD from an emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive childhood. 

I know I have a whole mess of issues. Narcissistic &amp; alcoholic mother, distant and homophobic father, financial struggles, a chronic autoimmune disorder, going to a catholic college as a lesbian, been sexually assaulted several times, am the victim of sexual abuse as a child, never being able to process grief, etc. The list never ends.

I guess my question is: where do I even start? Every therapist I see thinks a different thing is more than important everything else. I just want to start somewhere that isn’t right in the middle or a place I don’t feel comfortable starting at. I’ve had to walk out of therapists’ offices before bc they were unwilling to talk to me about some of my traumas bc they didn’t matter or weren’t important enough to them. And they all treat me with a weird “zoo animal” kind of fascination, sometimes prying and pushing me to the point where I feel physically sick or unsafe. I’ve almost always felt more suicidal walking out of therapist’s offices than into them. I thought they were supposed to be helpful, but I’ve yet to find anyone who doesn’t treat me like a baby, a freak, a science experiment, or a hopeless cause.

I just want to do something, *anything.* But since I can barely afford to eat, I don’t know how I’ll ever afford therapy. My chronic illness leaves me very fatigued and in bed most days, so working a full time job while going to school would be next to impossible. At this point, I feel trapped and hopeless. My life feels like one never-ending bad day, even when I have “good days.” I guess I’m just posting this because I don’t want to give up hope on myself even though all the signs point towards my situation being hopeless.",afterchampagne,2019-02-11 11:52:04,13,370,41.98,12.81,95.76,5.55,18.5,20.81,92.16,55.14,15.41,11.89,10,0,0,0,1.89,3.24,5.68,13.51,10,7.03,7.57,2.97,18.11,5.41,3.51,2.16,1.08,3.51,7.84,2.97,4.86,0.27,0.81,1.35,6.22,0.81,0,0.81,0.27,17.84,3.24,1.89,1.89,5.68,2.7,4.32,1.89,0.27,0,1.62,5.68,0,4.05,1.35,0.54,4.32,0.27,0.54,2.7,0.27,0.54,2.97,12.43,1.08,15.68,1.89,6.49,7.3,3.24,0.27,0.27,0.27,0.27,0.54,0.81,0.27,0.54,0,0,0,18.65,5.14,5.68,0.27,0.27,0.54,0,0.27,1.08,4.32,0,1.08

apkkjd,"My therapist said my dad and I both have ptsd, but I'm not sure I believe her?","My dad and I went through a traumatic experience not too long ago that causes our therapist to believe we may be suffering from ptsd. Not too long ago, my mother almost died from stage four liver failure and was placed on hospice. She was going through major withdrawals and we were told she only had a couple of weeks to live. She was seeing things, had to have her diapers changed regularly, had to be stopped when she tried to leave the house to get more alcohol. I have never been close to mom, but that experience required me to be a caregiver. We mourned for her, but we were also glad to be done with it when the time came. She was verbally abusive when she was drunk and tore me down till I was nothing but a pool on the floor. 
Another thing that happened when she was on hospice was she would fall. A lot. She's a heavy woman, and when things were quiet and I'd be doing something like playing video games or cleaning, a thunderous boom would be heard and everyone in the house would rush to mom's room. We didn't know what we would find. If her skull would be cracked open on the floor. Miraculously, she never suffered any chronic injuries from those falls. But those booms... I'll never forget it. The sounds of my mother dying. The sound that tore my soul in half and filled me with fear. It happened five times a day when I was alone, and I had to call dad to come and pick her up because little me couldn't do it myself.  Anyway. To this day, anything loud gives me that same feeling. That terrible feeling. The amount of anxiety and fear kills me. How do I conquer it? How can I not feel that way when I hear a dog bark, or a gunshot in a movie, or someone yelling? Maybe it's not even ptsd and I just so happen to hate loud things but I have never experienced that until the experience with my mother...",misssunnybunny,2019-02-11 12:26:08,8,369,11.63,39.31,59.83,1.68,14.19,13.82,95.12,62.6,21.14,13.82,7.86,1.9,0,4.07,0,7.32,5.42,10.3,12.47,6.5,10.03,3.25,21.95,1.9,0.81,2.71,0.81,1.9,4.61,0.81,3.79,0.81,1.08,1.36,10.84,2.17,0,5.69,0.81,13.55,1.9,1.63,1.9,3.25,1.9,4.34,5.96,0.54,3.25,1.08,2.44,0.81,1.63,0,0.54,4.07,2.17,0.81,1.08,0.27,0.54,9.21,8.94,0.81,14.36,2.44,5.69,6.23,0.54,1.9,0.81,0,0.27,1.08,0.27,0,0,0,0,0.27,13.82,7.32,3.52,0,0,0.81,0,0,0,2.17,0,0
apksve,Anyone have PTSD from living/having lived in a country with terrorism or experienced a terrorist attack?,"I lived in Istanbul, Turkey for three years. My husband (Turkish) and I recently moved back to the states and while I’m happy to be back home, I’ve been experiencing so many PTSD symptoms that I’m finally seeking help. I have an appointment with a trauma counselor in 10 days. 

Let me explain a little... 

I lived in Istanbul from 2015-2018. Within the first month of moving, there was a terror attack in Ankara. Months later, one in Istanbul. And over the next year-year and a half there were many attacks including a coup. The coup of July 2016 itself was the most terrifying event for me as we lived right next to the Bosporus Bridge. I still have videos of the gunfire I recorded. While I was already extremely on edge from the other attacks, this one in particular changed me. In addition to the rapid gunfire and the people being run on in tanks on the streets, there were multiple sonic booms from low-flying jets. One was so close to our home that it felt and sounded like an explosion. My husband and I were so scared that night that we had to take Xanax to be able to fall asleep at 5 am. 

The next attack that stands out to me was the Besiktas Stadium car bombing. We live near there so we heard and felt that one. I was already feeling like I’m living in a war zone. 

After all of these attacks and incidents in Turkey, I had trouble sleeping, I felt easily triggered by noises... any kind of noises but the ones that triggered me the most were airplanes flying over our apartment. My heart rate would go up at any noise.  I was extremely vigilant while using the metro or other public transport. I was scared of driving in traffic for fear that a bomb would go off. I hated being in crowded areas as I felt very unsafe. I always felt on edge. 

Now that we live in the states I feel safer but it seems to have manifested into insomnia. I have trouble sleeping and staying asleep due to noises. Any sound that I perceive to be unexpected I become jumpy, irritable, scared, sweaty, and an increased heart rate. I also hate thinking about those situations I experienced as they make me cry and feel awful. 

While I could go on and on, I wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced trauma from living in a country with frequent terrorism and/or experienced a terrorist attack themselves. 

I feel really alone in how I feel. Any comments would be appreciated.",neverfreeneverme9,2019-02-11 12:46:52,7,459,70.8,33.15,96.95,1,14.34,16.56,90.63,54.25,14.81,10.46,8.5,1.53,0,0,0.44,4.36,6.75,15.25,8.5,4.79,7.19,0,17.43,6.1,2.61,0.22,2.61,2.18,7.41,0.87,6.54,2.4,2.18,0.65,4.79,0.44,0,0,0.44,10.89,3.49,1.31,1.31,3.05,0.87,2.18,5.88,0.22,1.74,2.18,4.14,1.53,2.61,0,0,8.06,2.18,0.44,4.36,0.22,1.09,6.75,7.19,0,19.39,3.49,9.8,6.75,0.22,0.22,0.65,0,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.07,7.63,2.83,0,0,0.22,0,0.65,0,0.87,0.44,0.44

apnd5r,"First post, a bit shaken up","Hey everyone, first time posting here. Diagnosed with PTSD 2 years ago. 

So last night around 1am, I was in bed getting ready to sleep and I heard keys jangling outside my door, and I  just assumed it was my neighbours. I live in private student accommodation, so we have 24 hour security, I generally feel very safe. But then, after hearing these keys, my door began to open and a security guard walked in. I jumped out of bed to speak with him, apparently he'd had a noise complaint, my TV was on but it wasn't loud enough to be heard from where the complaint was, so he apologised for disturbing me and left. After he was gone I just broke down, it scared me so much

This morning I found out he filed a report himself because he's new to the job, and had thought that my flat was one with a communal living space, ie. A flat he would be allowed to enter without knocking. He had no idea he was walking into a studio flat, essentially my bedroom.
I know that this guy made an honest mistake, I'm not upset about that. It just upset me so much to have someone walk into my space like that with no warning. I don't necessarily want to go into my PTSD diagnosis on this post, but I'm so shaken up by this event.
I really don't feel like being in my apartment at all, and I can't sleep because I feel like someone could just walk in. I'm so on edge and I'm so tired. I feel like I'm overreacting, but when I think about it I start shaking. I just don't feel like anyone understands, so I guess that's why I'm here, I wanted to get it off my chest to people who would understand.

I'm tired of being afraid to go outside for weeks after I'm triggered.

I'm tired of explaining what PTSD is.

I'm tired of explaining that not only members of the military have PTSD.

I'm tired of people asking what trauma I suffered to get PTSD.  I shouldn't have to justify anything to anyone nor should I have to share something so personal.

I'm tired of being angry, always on the verge of tears, my thoughts racing a million miles a minute, dissociation, sleeplessness, memory loss, stomach issues, losing time, thinking everyone has ulterior motives, and feeling out of control.

I'm tired of people treating me like I am a bad person, incompetent, and less than because I have this condition.

And last but  not least I'm tired of people telling me to talk if I need to and then telling me to buck up or that's the way life is.  This is why I can't trust anyone.

I came up with some things that felt right, but I honestly am not sure if I like them because the excitement isn’t there. I have CPTSD and have had it all my life basically.

apuunn,"Wife is dissociated from reality, has been for 6 months","My wife has PTSD. She was diagnosed \~8 years ago, went through CBT,  seemed to 'recover', but we appear to be dealing with a relapse now. I believe it's been happening since September 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

She spends every moment of the day she can on the internet talking with a new group of friends she found on Twitter (none of whom know her in real life). She's built up this persona of herself that is effectively what she would be like if she were healthy, and interacts with people through this persona. She is so removed from reality that she's just completely unaware of her own emotions, body sensations, or literally anything going on around her.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how to help her. She sees a therapist, but I have no idea if she's told him she's having a relapse (this is a new therapist, she's only been seeing him for about 8 months). She won't make an appointment with her doctor for some anti-anxiety medication, the mere mention of it sends her into a panic attack that lasts hours. She doesn't leave the house unless she 100% cannot avoid it. Groceries are the exact same groceries every few days, she only buys enough to last for 2-3 days, and gets the exact same things. Self-care is going down the drain, her sleep is disturbed, and she can't even verbalize what is going on around her or inside her at any given moment. I have compassion for her wanting to escape feeling bad all the time, but by doing this she's making it worse because she's never coming down from panic attacks, she's just dissociated constantly.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know where to start. I'm the only one that works, we have a child, and I'm going through my own trauma therapy right now, and it's all I can do to hold life together as is.

aq127h,[Living with ptsd] - a little about me...,"I'm sure you're wondering why I must have started this blog page and well, I sort of don't know either. My first initial thought was to give myself a place I can express my feelings in hopes someone else can relate. I've been through a pretty tough time these past 7 months and I really don't think anyone understands. Well, at least no one I know. I'd like to fill you in on my story that got me into the position today to start writing this blog.On the morning of April 4th, 2015 at around 10:00 am I was woken suddenly from a deep sleep by my ever so annoying alarm clock and I'm sure you can relate. I start my daily routine. Get up, grab my clothes for the day, grab a towel and see how my mom is doing. Before I go any further let me explain a few things... My mother had diabetes and suffered severely. A couple weeks after coming home from a family vacation she noticed an infection in her foot. Her foot then started to change colors and eventually turned black. I could always hear her cry from how much pain she was in. She ended up getting her big toe amputated a couple months later. Then she started going down hill and here I am... a year and a half later.So I was checking on my mother and making sure she was okay. I entered her room casually and started with a happy ""good morning!"" and I got no response. I went in to her room to see her lying on her bed unconscious. I say mom, mom, mom!!! and no response. I rush towards her screaming her name and shaking her but I receive nothing. Its like she couldn't even hear me. I run down to my bedroom and wake my girlfriend, Molly. She goes back upstairs with me and we both try and wake her and nothing is working. Molly calls 911 and they tell us what to do. At this point my face has gone white and I'm staring at nothing. Molly's screaming my name but I can't hear her. Everything else around me has been put on mute. I start to hear her, its felt like 10 minutes have gone by but its only been seconds. I quickly snap out of it and help Molly with what ever the 911 operator instructs us to do. We were told to carry my mom off her bed and on to the floor to preform CPR. I don't know how we pulled it off but we did. I began pacing back and forth, back and forth around my house while Molly did everything she could. I hear the sirens in the distance, I can't believe this is actually happening. The emergency services came in and told us to get out so they can try and help my mom. We sit, and we sit, and we sit. Nothing seems to be happening. I have this deep gut feeling that she is gone but I didn't have the guts to say it. I couldn't swallow the truth. I had to have faith. We then got rushed to the hospital and started calling my family. One after another, I had to explain, Mom is in the hospital you have to come now. I knew she was gone but I can't say that, there has been no confirmation but the look I got from her when I first saw her, she was already gone before I could even do anything.My family arrived at the hospital and we sat and waited, and waited and waited. The nurse came in and we could see it on her face that it wasn't good news. I knew she was gone. She then said the words, your mother has passed away. Those words were the worst thing anyone has ever said to me. I look around at everyone crying, and I'm just blank faced. I didn't know what to do. Do they know what my girlfriend and I just went through? I feel like I'm the most content person here and I watched my mother pass away in front me. I knew there was nothing we could do, there was nothing anyone could do but we had to try.Well, that's what happened. I've been trying my best to live with what happened these past 7 months but its been the hardest months of my life. I hide so many feelings from people because I'm afraid they won't understand. I've lost my mother, my best friend. The only woman I could ask anything to.I've been really struggling lately and it's severely affecting my social life, school and relationship. I'm afraid I'll lose everything.This is The Derek Report, the unwritten story of turning my life around.[The Derek Report](thederekreport.wordpress.com)",TheDerekReport,2019-02-12 17:36:22,1,823,18.2,50.49,92.8,22.01,14.19,12.64,94.65,60.51,23.09,17.86,11.18,1.82,0.61,3.77,0.49,5.22,4.37,11.42,11.06,5.22,7.41,2.67,24.67,3.04,2.19,1.34,1.58,1.34,4.37,1.94,2.19,0.61,0.24,0.61,14.09,1.82,0.36,5.35,0,12.03,3.04,1.22,1.34,2.07,2.31,2.55,3.89,1.34,1.46,1.09,3.28,1.34,1.7,0,0.24,6.56,3.04,1.34,1.22,1.34,0.49,9.23,12.39,1.09,18.1,3.52,7.53,7.65,0.97,0.85,1.22,0,0.12,0,0.49,0,0,0.12,0.36,0,16.77,8.38,3.04,0.12,0,0.12,0.49,0.12,0.24,3.52,0.24,0.49
aq1g4s,Daily Klonopin - Thoughts?,"I’m so nervous about meds, I’ve always tried to be as natural as possible but I am in a constant state of panic. I am a sexual assault victim, when I came forward there was retaliation and stalking against another victim, he always made bail, after 2 years at the sentencing he was put on suicide watch. It has been a really intense time for me. I also believe I was assaulted as a child... I tried emdr therapy but I couldn’t do it anymore I panicked and stopped going. I finally sought help from an psych APRN. She referred me to the medical marijuana program and prescribed me klonopin originally just at night and an antidepressant. The antidepressant was horrible, I felt like I was in a bubble and even more sad. Like this really sad film over my life. She decided that my anxiety is too high and that I should try the klonopin during the day to in the am to see if that helps. So I’m doing am and pm, the goal is to just do medical marijuana and be on no meds. I’m just terrified I’m getting sucked into something that’s hard to get off of. I work a high stress job, I wake up at 4:30 every morning now and exercise, I meditate, I also have a chronic disease I manage, and have been formally diagnosed with PTSD. Most people wouldn’t know any of the above about me because I’m super private but I feel that has also been to my detriment. Anyway, any input is appreciated.

aq25ut,My husband does not believe in my PTSD.,"We are both 28, married for a year now, and from different cultures. I am American and he is Algerian. I want to start by affirming that he is well meaning. He loves me, he is gentle, kind, and honestly the best man I have ever known.

I have PTSD from childhood trauma. While I was physically, mentally, and emotionally abused by both parents. For the most part, I have been in a good place and I was doing a great job avoiding triggers. In January, however, one of the classes I am enrolled in has been a huge trigger point for me. It is a psych class, but I was not expecting having to write personal narratives about different developmental lifespans.

I have been trapped in my pain, to the point of wanting to die. I told my husband tonight. He doesn't want to hear about the PTSD and asked me to stop living in the past. He told me to be strong, fight it, and look to the future. He told me that I was tiring him, and that he doesn't want me to ruin a happy time in our lives (we are having a destination wedding in a few months to celebrate our marriage). 

I know him inside and out, and I understand that he is trying to help me and motivate me. But I also know that he does not understand PTSD or high functioning mental illness. I tried explaining it to him, and he would repeat it back to me like it was crazy, and it would make me feel shame and resort to saying, ""I don't know. I don't know how to describe it.""

I'm not sure how to help someone understand PTSD? I also don't know if this class is beneficial and an opportunity for deeper healing or if it is just destroying my health.",malakasinat,2019-02-12 19:35:39,14,320,23.78,34.21,59.88,55.21,15.24,15.31,94.69,61.25,21.25,16.56,10.94,1.25,0,4.38,0,4.69,5,12.19,11.88,3.75,8.44,2.81,22.19,4.69,1.88,0.62,0.62,1.56,7.5,4.38,2.81,0.62,0.94,0.31,12.5,1.88,0,0,5.31,13.75,4.38,1.88,2.81,2.19,0.62,4.06,1.56,0.31,0.62,0.62,2.81,0,2.5,0,0,8.75,4.38,1.88,2.5,1.25,0.62,4.69,15,1.25,10.31,0,5.94,4.69,2.5,0.31,0,0,0,0.31,0.31,0,0,0,0.31,0,15.62,6.25,5.94,0,0,0.31,0,0,0.62,1.88,0.62,0
aq29ss,How to reintegrate and create supports for yourself?,"I went through something mildly-traumatic about a year ago. My house was broken into by armed people while I was inside. It's been a year and I've seen social workers many times (no therapists/psychiatrists) but I still feel completely removed from the actual world. 

I've noticed that when I'm connected to old friends, I feel like a different person. I try to enjoy things, focus on self-care and being in the moment. However, I go to university in a different city and it's been difficult to find friends since. It's like a constant cycle of getting triggered, losing the rest of the day to dealing with it and then playing catch up with missed schoolwork. I have no energy to put in the extra effort to work on social skills and re-engage like most people do. 

I know I'm only 19 and this is a battle for the foreseeable future, but I hate that it seems like everyone else is finding their way through relationships and getting support from friends/family. My family is toxic and until I get better I just cant get what I need from them either.

aq4yw8,Tracking my family history of CSA,"I was recently diagnosed with PTSD after experiencing years of CSA at the hands of my twin brother for many years - it was only in recent years I realised it wasn’t experiencing. Sadly I perpetuated this and attempted to engage with my younger brother a few years younger - fortunately he said no and i respected that  (which I have recently discussed with him today).

My thoughts are that my twin was assaulted when he was younger because of the things he asked me to do at 8 years old. I’ve been trying to track how this might have occurred started by finally telling my younger brother what happened and if it occurred to him too (which fortunately it hadn’t)

Is this wrong, going behind his back to try find who it might have been if anyone? For background all 3 of us have mental health issues, as do some of my half-siblings. I’m wondering if more than I’d imagined is related to my trauma.

aq5n3j,Every time the lights turn off I am reminded of how it all began.,"so my traumatic event began around 4 years ago in middle school. I was in second period and it was thundering and lightning outside. Class had just begun then we all hear a loud burst of thunder and we see there’s a flash of lightning from the window. The next thing we know, the power goes out. I was in the complete dark, which was slightly alarming but I was too concerned yet. around 15-30 seconds later the generator kicks on and everyone can see again. Then a few seconds after the power turned back on, the speaker from the office tells everyone to go to the hallway and get into their tornado positions. Everyone was lined up against the lockers in their tornado positions. I heard the teachers saying there was a tornado forming outside. We stayed in our tornado positions for around 30 minutes. the scariest 30 minutes of my life. I acted like I was fine, but I wasn’t. After 45 minutes in the hallway we got to go back to our class. 
It’s been around 4 years since this and I still think about it. I close my eyes and all I see are tornados. When it is windy outside all I can think about is that day. It’s taken me years to look at a picture of a tornado and not jump or scream/gasp. Whenever people say the word tornado I start to breathe heavy and I can’t think straight. When we do tornado drills in schools all I can think about is that day. I get why we do the drills but I feel like it takes me back to that day and that is painful. yesterday my power went out for times, I jumped and screamed. every time the lights turn off all I can think about is that day. I just feel like I might die, even though it is winter right now. I know it is not logical to think these thoughts but I can not help it. It really hurts because I used to love tornadoes. I wanted to become a meteorologist to study them and weather in general but now I just can’t. I have felt so sad because the one thing I loved is what hurt me the most. I also sorta feel like I don’t deserve to label myself with PTS(D?). What happened to me happened to almost a thousand other people in my school. They are fine. We didn’t get hit by a tornado. We all lived. I feel like the only one who was impacted from that day. thanks for reading my story, it feels really good to share, and sorry this post is so long. I have wanted to tell someone about this but never really had anywhere that I felt I could go. I want to reach out for help and one day I will.

1. Does the traumatic event have to be violent? I was always under the impression that only veterans and victims of violent crimes had PTSD. Or can you have PTSD because your childhood, while not necessarily violent, was traumatic in other ways? Could a childhood of emotional abuse cause PTSD?

2. I have very common PTSD symptoms/reactions, but I do not remember any violent or necessarily traumatic events. Is it still possible to have PTSD without any recollection of the traumatic event(s). 

3. Sometimes I have flashbacks and night terrors about memories/events that I dont really remember. Is it possible to have PTSD over traumatic events you dont remember? Why wouldn't I remember them?

I feel disgusting. It happened a bit over three years ago but ever since, my sex drive has been so high and I hate it. It doesn't help that I'm 17 and I feel like I shouldn't be like this even though I know teenage hormones are a bit out of wack at my age. I haven't had sex yet and honestly penetration scares me because of what he did to me, I want it so bad, but I don't. If that makes sense? I dont masturbate because it doesn't feel good, I've never actually had an orgasm either. That might be because I'm also a trans guy so I'm also pretty uncomfortable wiyh my genitals. I dunno.

aq722r,[Living with ptsd] - 3 years later,"It's been 3 years since I started my blog and made my first and only post. I'm not sure why I started it but obviously I had some intention to use it as a form of therapy. When I wrote my first blog post it had only been 7 months since the loss of my mother... The day I failed to save her life.. so I thought. After that first blog post.. I did in fact lose everything.. at the time.My girlfriend Molly of 3 years or so was trying to be supported during my hard times but when she returned to University she couldn't help me anymore and it was stressing her out. One day I moved her in and two days later she left me. It was sudden and out of nowhere and left me broken for months... I drank, smoked weed and dropped out of college. My life went downhill and I didn't see much point anymore. I had a basement apartment for 3 months and I stayed down there hoping I'd find an answer but I didn't. I researched how to commit suicide without feeling any pain.. I did my research and figured out a few ways but I just kept drinking and laying in my basement apartment day in and day out. Eventually I didn't have any more money so I had to move in with my sister.. She helped me for a bit and I'm so grateful. While there, I smoked weed still but stopped drinking. It was a change and I found that balance that helped deal with my mental health and whatever else was going on.After a few months of living with my sister I didn't do anything.. we were both depressed after losing our mother. Shortly near the end of living with her our Grandmother passed away. Our mothers mother... It was difficult but I didn't cry. I was emotionless, confused but in peace. Shortly after we had her funeral. Guess who attended? .. Yep. Molly. I was so nervous because I wasn't sure why she was there, I thought maybe she was there to support me and we can maybe get back together or maybe she was there to just show her support and leave it at that but nope.. Never heard from her after that. Couple months go by and I start talking to a few girls trying to make some friends and build a life again. During my relationship with Molly I lost a lot of friends because I was so infatuated with her and in love. I had tunnel vision and before I knew it I was alone with my small group of friends In my sisters apartment not doing anything with my life waiting for that text saying ""I want you back"" or whatever. My friend who I grew up with moved an hour away and had a student room in the same house available so I hopped on it.Let me go back a month. I started talking to this girl named Nicole, she was so beautiful! I was nervous to go into something but I didn't totally turn down the idea of another relationship. We met a couple times.. went for dinner and went on a walk 4 weeks went by and I haven't kissed her yet because I didn't want to ruin anything we had.. or I thought we had...To be continued..[The Derek Report ](thederekreport.wordpress.com)Talk soon,DerekDecember 11th, 2018",TheDerekReport,2019-02-13 06:21:18,4,588,25.26,23.75,98.32,18.27,14.7,13.95,94.05,60.2,21.09,15.99,11.39,1.53,0.17,2.89,0,5.1,3.74,13.61,8.5,6.29,9.01,2.72,19.39,4.08,1.87,1.53,2.04,2.72,4.59,2.04,2.55,0.68,0,1.53,9.69,1.36,0.85,4.59,0,13.27,1.7,2.21,0.68,3.57,1.53,4.42,1.36,0.51,0.34,0.51,2.89,0,1.7,0,1.02,7.31,4.25,1.7,1.19,0.17,1.02,11.22,5.27,0.68,19.9,3.23,6.97,9.86,1.36,0.85,0.85,0.17,0,0.34,0.17,0,0.17,0.17,0,0,16.16,10.71,1.19,0,0,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.34,2.38,0.34,0.68

aqds62,Unexpected Breakup. Feeling Lost.,"Bless who ever reads this and offers advice.

My gf of ~20 months (26f) spontaneously broke up with me (26m)...

We were fine just a few days ago. We hung out like always and had a good time. We had been okay for months, both stressed about different things in life, but we've always supported each other, then boom. All of sudden she was having thoughts of breaking up and being unhappy. She hasn't spoken to me in 6 days now, and we spoke every single day for nearly 20 months before that. She's my lighthouse. Like. I feel so lost.

Sorry, I literally could make a book series describing how amazing our relationship has been before all this happened, how she's like the Robin AND Tracey to my Ted of HIMYM (just gave her the yellow umbrella a couple weeks ago and she loved it), how she's the Rose AND River to my Doctor from DW, and then a short book about everything that happened this week. 
But to shorten:
She's my best friend. Like, insane level of understanding and help and support and fun and trust. Hung out every week. Went on adventures, out to dinner, to movies, saw friends. Well, before last week...

To clarify: I absolutely want to work things out. I think we've had an amazing relationship, and I want to figure things out. She said maybe break up for the first few days since she mentioned it, but when I upsetly pushed the issue at a time she was stressed, it turned into her not wanting to work on things. 

(Also, she's who helped me the MOST out of my last relationship a few years ago and made my life absolutely better overall. But she and I every so often, even recently, discussed how horrible it was for my last ex to up and leave with NO explanation ever. She would tell me how shitty that was and felt bad for me.)

I've left her alone because I know how she's someone who needs space after being overwhelmed, that she was already overwhelmed and stressed before this happened, and I'm sure she's needed time to recharge. She never said not to talk, but just stopped responding last Friday. She hasn't made any attempt to talk since then. So, I've been terribly depressed for the last week not talking to her, I'm trying to give her time, and I'm just wondering how on earth this all happened out of nowhere. I'm really struggling to wrap my head around what happened because our relationship has been so amazing. No one in my life, nor me, saw this coming. We even had several plans for months from now. The only thing that's made any sense to me is her PTSD and/or bipolar causing all of this. I mentioned that last week, but I don't think she listened. Idk what to think, or of she'll even talk to me. To clarify, she has always been described as one of the nicest people ever. She's has lots of work experience in the psychological field, and is always incredibly understanding. (She doesn't always take care of her own physical pr mental health that well, though.)

(Below is what I've planned for handling things.)

But I bought her Valentine's gift a couple weeks ago. She and I have these soft, foam ball pillows (idk how to describe) that have always been, like, ""our special pillows"" that we always use together. She also loves raccoons. We saw this a few weeks ago when we goofing around having fun in the store, and she really liked it. So I went and got it without her right after.

http://imgur.com/a/gJd8pFh

Thought about taking it to her house tomorrow (Valentine's Day), but I figured that would be too surprising and overwhelming for her. I thought about just texting her ""I love you"" and/or ""Happy Valentine's Day"" at 8:21 because that's her birthday. She LOVES her birthday, and usually tries to look at the clock for that special time. But I still worried that wasn't a good option.

To keep my mind off of her the other day, I had been stress cleaning. I found a small piece if paper on my dresser that I have NO IDEA where it came from. It had some Gallifreyan on it and said ""GALLIFREYAN TRANSLATION: I LOVE YOU"". Out relationship has had TONS of ""signs from the universe"". Legit. So, I thought of this as one. I figured I could attach it to her gift and just overnight it to her for Valentine's Day. I printed out a larger copy of it. 

http://imgur.com/a/6pVBljP

Her favorite color is green. So, green crayon. Mine is blue, so blue, obvious, but is also cool cause I randomly picked the crayon ""cornflower blue"" and that's the color tie Barney from HIMYM freaks out about before his wedding.

She LOVES vines. Like, a LOT. One of her favorite vines is:
🎶 ""You are my dad. You're my dad! Boogie woogie woogie"" 🎶 ?
https://youtu.be/BsuY9lHxg88
🎶 ""To Ariel. Ariel! Boogie woogie woogie"" 🎶

One of her FAVORITE THINGS EVER is Hamilton. Our first date, which we've always bragged to people about being the best first date, was to a gay bar to see Hamilton in drag. It was an amazing night. So, Hamilton has always meant a lot to us. We LOVE to sing together. Our mutual friends we were just on vacation with sent us a bootleg copy of the show. She had never actually watched it, not just listen. So, it was a huge deal. We had been meaning to watch it for weeks, but she kept forgetting it when she came over. We had finally nailed down plans to watch it last Friday. That was the plan until Thursday when she broke up with me. But the past weeks she had been ecstatically telling me about her favorite song, Wait For It. She passionately sang it to me in the car. (I started singing it over and over yesterday. Didn't even know the words yesterday. It's one of the only things that's given me hope.)

So I sent her this,

I was diagnosed with PTSD about a year ago, but because of insurance issues have stopped getting treatment for it. I was physically abused by my father as a child, and later got into a relationship with someone who was verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive. I haven't been able to get into a serious relationship since that one ended, and anytime anyone bigger than me (I'm a 5ft 1 F) makes a sudden movement towards me or slightly raises their voice, I get extremely startled or even go into full anxiety attacks.

Please can someone help me find a mechanism to cope?

I applied for SSI out of desperation because I didn't want to leave my best friend alone to pay the bills. But I got denied. 

Valentine's Day is also extremely triggering because it reminds me that I have no family or a partner to share it with. Plus my birthday is in five days and no one is going to do anything for me. I have no money to celebrate by myself either. 


I wish I could drink away my worries or get high but I'm 4 years sober and weed is illegal here so that blows. 

My roommate drives himself and me everywhere for important things and his vehicle needs repairs with money neither of us have. I feel so useless and worthless, I wish I could help him. Im worried about bills and expenses like my cats meds &amp; my own meds. 

I just fucking lost it and started crying and sobbing like a banshee. In a manic state, I grabbed a razor and cut up my arm. When the pain started, I felt relief. Like I deserved to be hurt since I was so useless and unwanted. 

Now I'm here feeling numb and hopeless. I am utterly alone and my brain is scarred from years of abuse, trauma, and instability. I try so hard to keep my head above water and to help with bills. I even tried selling pics of my feet and boobs to help but I've been called ugly so thats a no go.

aqirey,***TW*** I just wish I could run away from my own mind and never come back... ***TW***,"I am 38 and have been through so much hell in my life from my step dad beating me till I was bleeding or raping me and molesting me from age 5 to 8, being forced into incest by an uncle and forced to have sex with one of his daughters as he watched. Or witnessing many deaths either natural deaths or suicides even losing a friend of mine to suicide. Lost my Fiancee and our daughter she was 8 months pregnant with. 

I survived ten plus years of being homeless and 33 years of being obese and unable to lose weight from my hormones fighting against me. I have done many jobs in this life and done many things. but nothing helps with the memories, helps with the triggers, the flashbacks, the endless nightmares that make me wake up either crying, screaming, shaking, confused and conflicted or in cold sweats or all of them at once. 

When I do sleep it is only a few hours here a few there. I nap throughout the day a couple hours here a couple there. I am always so god damn fucking tired. physically fucking tired, mentally tired, emotionally drained and exhausted. I honestly don't know how I can keep going, how I can keep tracking along but yet I do and every day is like walking on egg shells with myself.

I have tried therapy, group therapy, psychiatry and over a thousand medications which none worked. either made things worse or turned me into a robot or had severe side effects from. I just stopped going to my psychiatrist because my old one quit and got a new one and didn't like her very much. We didn't really click, the vibe was off balance and I hated the fact she was younger than me. 

I been listening to this song that was just released last week by a singer I like, Reina del Cid, called Moss and Fern and the lyrics to it and the vibe of the song and the tone of the song just all hits me so fucking hard. I literally can't shut the song off and when I do I end up going right back to it. It just hits me so hard because I can relate to the person she is singing it about. and I wished I had someone to take my hand and lift me up and just be there for me and just guide me along, but alas, I am here single, alone, no friends, no family. I am utterly alone in this entire world and I am a ghost. 

I sometimes just wish, I just wish for gods fucking sake I could run away from my own mind and just escape and stop being a fucking prisoner to this shit and could be normal and live a normal fucking life and be a normal human being. I just wish I could be cured from this shit and never have to deal with it again. 

Some days I feel like just packing a bag of clothes and grabbing my knife and wallet and just hitting the road on foot and never looking back and just keep going until I can't keep going anymore and just keep traveling like I did in my entire 20's and early 30's, but unfortunately my body won't allow that now since I developed arthritis in my lower back, knees, ankles, feet. So that is a no go unless I had a vehicle which I am trying to save for which isn't going so well.

Some days I just wish I would not woken up and would not have to face another day of wondering whats going to trigger me or is today going to be a good day. 

I just feel like screaming and breaking things all around me but unfortunately I live in a place where I can't do that. Idk anymore what to do. I am at my breaking point and I have had a few mental breakdowns in my life already and feel like I may have another coming on soon because of this fucking PTSD.",alllreadydead188,2019-02-14 03:24:51,5,710,28.57,6.79,84.31,1,23.67,12.54,91.69,59.72,16.48,12.25,10.99,0.28,0,0.85,0.14,4.23,4.93,12.39,9.3,7.46,10.28,2.68,17.18,5.07,1.83,1.27,1.97,3.66,5.63,1.13,4.51,0.28,1.97,0.99,3.94,0.99,0.42,0.99,0.56,11.27,1.13,1.97,1.69,2.25,1.69,3.94,2.82,0.28,1.27,1.27,6.2,1.97,2.68,1.55,0.42,5.63,1.27,1.27,1.97,0.56,0.85,4.08,8.87,2.39,13.52,2.54,5.35,6.2,0.42,1.13,0.14,0,0.28,0.7,1.83,1.55,0.14,0,0.14,0.14,11.13,4.37,3.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.55,0,1.69
aqk5hn,One hell of a dream to start Valentines Day (tw-sexual abuse),"So instead of not dreaming or having a dream that I was gonna live happily ever after with the wonderful man I’m with now (the only one that deserves to be called a man so far), ptsd has a way of making sure I start this day off with the reminder that I’m nothing. And you know, it’s right I guess. I’m 100% convinced ptsd is a demon. It’s gotta be. 
So I had a dream that went off with someone who was going to fix my boyfriends truck. Somehow though, it was someone I didn’t wanna see. Someone who..he was toxic and somehow he was there.
The moment I got in the truck with him, I felt the tense atmosphere. He made sure I locked the door and was in a seatbelt, not for my safety. Then he took me to my first high school. I looked at him, trying not to seem visibly mad or upset. He just kept at me until I told him where we were.
“Yeah you fucking whore. You’re back where no ones gonna find you, just like before.” *he gets on his knees too to my level* “Now why don’t you just stay here. No ones gonna look for you now either.”
I was at a k-12 school. I got raped in an unused part of the elementary building. Head bashed, resisting, not even a chance to stay conscious. He never got charges despite a positive rape kit, bruising, stitches across my forehead, and signs of a severe concussion. 

I’m almost “out of the woods”. Collectively over the years, the traumatizing things that happened to me went from August to third week of February. I’m so close to happiness. I’m so close to not fighting as hard and getting a break for the summer. But I feel as though that dream was a foot to trip me just before breaking the finish line tape. Everyone has gotten through, I was in first but now I get to watch myself assume the last place. And nobody is gonna ask about who tripped me.",832Squiddy,2019-02-14 06:12:50,0,363,44.57,27.23,90.66,9.04,12.96,11.29,92.01,60.33,19.01,13.77,8.82,0.28,1.65,3.03,0,5.23,7.71,14.33,8.26,8.54,5.79,3.31,19.01,3.58,1.93,1.65,1.93,0.55,5.23,1.93,3.31,0.55,1.93,0,9.09,0,0.55,0,3.86,12.12,2.2,0.83,0.28,3.58,2.2,4.13,2.2,1.38,0,0.83,3.03,1.1,0.55,1.38,0,5.23,0.83,0.83,0.83,2.48,0.28,7.44,9.92,2.2,17.08,3.03,7.44,7.16,0.83,1.38,0.28,0,0.55,0,3.03,0.83,1.65,0.55,0,0,19.01,7.99,3.86,0,0,0,0,0.55,1.65,3.03,1.1,0.83

I’m convinced that these issues go beyond just being a symptom of my PTSD/anxiety/depression (although I do acknowledge they can contribute), but at this point I’ve been blown off by so many doctors who essentially tell me it’s all in my head. This has happened often enough that even being at a low key appointment is triggering. When I’m in a doctor’s office, I can feel myself right on the edge of a panic attack. I try to remind myself to breathe deeply, really focusing on what the doctor is saying instead of letting my brain run away to worst case scenarios, and bring in a list of objectives/questions I wrote ahead of time because I know I can’t think straight in the moment. Despite this, every time I leave I have a crippling panic attack (like, locking myself in the bathroom, sobbing on the floor type of panic attack.) I try to call a friend or my parents but honestly that usually makes it worse. My usual game plan is to wait it out for 10-30 min, stumble out of the office bathroom and to my car and drive home when I feel safer after my Ativan kicks in. Does anyone else have this problem? What are your strategies?",yawaworhtymsisihtih,2019-02-14 07:48:35,3,234,69.84,15.25,99,1,21.27,17.52,89.74,55.13,17.95,11.54,10.68,0,0.43,0,0.43,6.41,6.41,16.24,8.12,4.7,5.13,0.43,14.96,2.56,2.14,2.14,0.85,1.28,8.12,0.85,7.26,2.56,1.71,1.71,4.27,0.43,0.43,0,0,11.54,2.99,1.28,0.43,2.99,0.85,3.85,1.71,0,0.43,0.85,4.7,1.28,3.42,0,0,9.4,1.28,2.14,4.27,0,1.71,1.28,13.68,0.85,19.66,2.99,10.68,5.98,3.42,1.28,1.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.38,3.42,4.27,0,0,0.85,0,0.43,0,3.42,1.71,1.28
aql7b0,*rant* psychiatrist won't take me seriously,"As background, I have complex post traumatic stress disorder (only diagnosed as PTSD by a different physician)and before that was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression by my PCP in my teens.

So basically I had shit health insurance which left me with a doctor who doesn't listen when my symptoms get worse and always tells me to ""think positive"". Thank goodness I've got better health insurance; now it's just the process of finding a new doctor and getting in to see them. 

But in the meantime I've got someone who 1. Didn't listen or care when I said I was going to end up losing my job due to panic attacks at work (along with some other chronic health issues) and having to leave. 2. Doesn't seem concerned that I've not been able to work since and though some of my physical symptoms (non-ptsd related) have improved, my mental health isn't good.

I've been experiencing more dissociation (something I had to look up myself as this guy only cares that I'm not suicidal, nothing about educating his patients or actually trying to come up with an effective treatment plan), as well as more frequent panic attacks. I don't sleep well (it takes me quite some time to fall asleep) and I experience nightmares fairly often which leave me feeling exhausted more often than not. I'm hypervigilant a lot (this was worse when I lived in the city. I got to the point where I couldn't drive because I kept being triggered so badly). 

I can't deal with loud sounds or people raising their voices without my anxiety getting really bad and having to remove myself from the situation or have a straight up panic attack and possibly dissociate if bad enough. People or situations that remind me of the abuse/abusers will trigger panic attacks. It had gotten to where I wasn't leaving my house unless I absolutely had to. I've been working with a therapist and while I've eliminated some toxic individuals in my life who were partly to blame for the c-ptsd, I'm not really better. If anything I'm worse. I've developed some level of agoraphobia. Going to the grocery store by myself is an exhausting ordeal in and of itself, nevermind anywhere else outside of doctors appointments.

But no, this man won't listen to me or acknowledge how much this is affecting my life and limiting me. Thank goodness I've gotten to where I can drive some places again. But the therapy, working on grounding techniques, and prescribed anti-depressents and anti-anxiety meds just aren't cutting it. Oh, and if I mention to said doctor that I have been needing to take the anti-anxiety meds more often due to panic attacks, he just warns me that they can be addictive so try not to take them. Like Jesus H. Christ, are you going to give me anything else, advice, anything? or do you expect me to just hermit and never function normally again?

I just want to be able to go places without fearing a complete breakdown or having to run to my car to have a panic attack (assuming I make it that far) until I feel safe enough to either go back in or drive home. This is debilitating. I can't even begin to bring up potentially getting a service dog to help with this and I'm scared to death that I'll be out in public by myself and dissociate and not be able to respond to people around me (I tend to just shut down/almost black out).

aqlwtw,I used to love living in the city,"When I first moved to a big city, I loved it.

Ever since developing PTSD, I've come to hate it. I wish I had a car so I could drive myself away from all the sirens and flashing lights, to a place where police cruisers and ambulances are scarce, somewhere where I can't hear those sounds or sew those lights that send me into a panic.

PTSD frustrates me a lot. It's frustrating to be scared all the time, to be on constant alert, to feel the need to carry a knife at all times just to feel a little safer. I wish things would be normal again, but I can't go back and erase my traumatic experiences.

aqmxx5,Is this PTSD?,"Tried to create a throwaway for this one but Reddit's system was having issues.  

I am male, mid-late 30s. 

A number of months ago I was riding light rail in my city. I sat down behind a number of girls who appeared to be high school age and one of their friends/sisters (I don't know relationship) who appeared to be in the 12-13 year old range (also overheard her mention going to a local middle school) was sitting on the other side of the aisle. In front of her was an older man listening to headphones. 

The girls sitting in front of me got off a stop or two after I got on, and the other girl remained seated in the other aisle. A few seconds after they got off I saw the girl in the other aisle immediately move over to the aisle in which I was sitting. She didn't say anything, but the older man in front of her said ""Sorry"" and then snickered a little. Because I didn't see what happened, I couldn't intervene, but I suspected he had attempted something, so I kept my eye on him. 

A few seconds later he started singing the Rolling Stones' ""Brown Sugar"" (the girl appeared to be of Hispanic lineage) and Lynard Skynard's ""That Smell"" and creepily staring at the girl in front of me, who was staring out the window. At that point I knew something was definitely very wrong and resigned myself to intervene if it got any more serious (I was debating at what point I could legally step in.) 

A few seconds later he looked over at her and pointed his finger and said, ""I never did **anything** to you!"" at which point I unzipped the bag I carry my laptop and other items in and pulled out the 4-cell Maglite I carry so the bus I catch in the mornings can see me, and had it ready. The man then reached over and attempted to grab the girl. I slammed the seat in front of me with my flashlight and screamed something to the effect of ""That's enough! Leave her alone!"" Both the old man and the girl jumped. The old man then said something like ""I can speak to her any way I want to! I didn't do anything!"" I then said something about how she moved over there for a reason, and that if he tried anything further I would beat him within an inch of his life and no jury would convict me (I can't remember my words exactly-I sometimes get memory loss when I'm really angry.) Dude then said something like ""Well if you leave me alone I'll keep to myself"" (again, I can't remember the dialogue exactly. At one point the girl said thank you, and I remember as dude got off he tried to shake my hand and I told him to leave me a lone and get off the train.

So, here's the thing. Ever since then I go through this scenario in my mind and have some pretty violent thoughts go through my head. Every time I ride public transportation I feel like I want to fight someone, which is not normal. I've spent countless hours watching [pedophiles interrogated by police](https://youtu.be/YZ8-up3hRA8) and have violent fantasies about attacking people like this....I don't know if I need to seek help. I have not had these thoughts or feelings before. I suffered abuse as a child, though not of the sexual variety, and am not sure if this isn't feeding into this.",Oakwood2317,2019-02-14 10:35:28,1,608,57.18,29.35,94.49,8.23,20.97,14.8,90.62,57.4,19.57,13.32,9.54,0,0.49,2.96,0.33,6.25,7.24,14.14,6.74,3.12,7.89,2.47,17.76,4.61,2.8,1.64,1.15,1.64,4.11,1.32,2.8,0.16,0.99,1.15,10.53,0.16,0.49,2.96,2.63,12.83,2.3,0.99,1.97,4.28,1.15,4.44,5.26,2.14,1.97,0.82,1.32,0.66,0.16,0.16,0.33,4.77,0.66,0.99,1.97,1.15,0.49,7.89,7.4,1.32,19.24,3.12,10.03,6.09,0.82,0.49,0.16,0.16,0,0,0.82,0,0.33,0,0.16,0,17.76,4.61,2.63,0,0,0.16,0.82,0.82,2.3,2.8,2.14,1.48
aqn81q,General paranoia,"Over a year ago I went through a knife attack and was also physically assaulted at work. Sadly my PTSD was compounded by the negligence of my employers and their lack of support. They made it many many times worse.

At the moment I'm doing well in my recovery though. I have a new job and I've moved on with my life. I still attend therapy regularly and I have good coping strategies for when flashbacks occur.

But I cannot shake this general sense of paranoia. When I'm not having emotional flashbacks and remembering what happened to me, I have this horrible sense of impending doom instead. It's different to a flashback. It's worrying about what *could* happen next. Shortness of breath and a nervous clench in my stomach. I worry that everyone is just like my former employers were: cold, uncaring, unprofessional, deceitful. 

I find it really hard to trust people and it makes me feel anxious all the time. I get panic attacks and sometimes have nightmares about what people might be saying and doing. Just wondering if anyone can relate or has any advice?

aqotzj,"I think I have PTSD but I am not sure (16,M)","This is my first post on this subreddit. I think I've been traumatized and I'll give my backstory. Yesterday I was walking around my apartment listening to some creepypasta on my phone thinking for ideas till I hear my neighbor yell for help, it takes me a minute to register but I look through the peephole unsure if it's a fire or not. I see the neighbor and their boyfriend arguing and said neighbors throws a ball. The boyfriend pulls out a gun from his glove compartment and I assume he pulls back the hammer. I begin to panic and I ran back to my room in terror, locking the door. The police were called but I'm not sure what they did. 

I believe I've been traumatized because now whenever I hear any noises from outside or hear anyone talking I immediately run to my room and lock the door. I can't sleep anymore thinking it'll happen again. I went to bed at 3 am because of how scared I was. I can't look at humanity or guns the same way again and I'm scared just being here. I have anxiety and depression that I both have medication for and I'm not sure if that's a factor. Now I spend most of my time in my room playing games and I'm too scared to go around the rest of the apartment without someone being home.

aqqods,triggers/anniversary time ruining my relationship/friendships,"I have been feeling terrible lately and I realized it’s because it’s been the 2 year mark of when I got out of an abusive “relationship” which only lasted 3 months but felt like a lifetime. 

I’m super set off, I noticed when I kept apologizing to friends and just trying to act annoying so the people in my life would dump me. I keep carrying the blame for what happened to me, I keep hearing the abusers voice telling me “no one will love you ever again after what I’ve done to you” and what’s my luck, after getting out of the abuse I met someone who’s really great but sadly after going out a few times I also pushed them away. For some reason they talked to me still and didn’t judge me, I always wondered why.  I went and got intense counselling/therapy and did my own healing for over a year, at that point we still spoke, I still couldn’t get why. We started going out again for a few months but recently agreed on putting things on hold which was fine. But then the anniversary dates came up and I was triggered a lot, so I took the whole break thing out of proportion and I apologized to them cause in my ptsd mindset, silence equals punishment. I know it’s irrational and I know I’m cared about but I guess it’s hard to accept. I’m very shocked that even after that they still talk to me as normal. 

I’m waiting for my therapist to return my voicemail to make an appointment cause I can’t deal with this alone anymore, I’ve been crying a lot and not knowing how to cope healthily. I feel bad for hiding my symptoms but in the start I was handling it fairly well, regulating my feelings and was stable. I’m worried that things are irreparable because of my apologizing and taking constant blame :( has anyone experienced similar? What kind of therapy and work is necessary to push past this?

I got home from classes and it really just hit me right in the chest. I want to ask if any of my friends are free but at the same time I want to be alone. Is that weird? I just kinda want the company of someone without any expectations. 

My best friend is busy right now, which makes me a kinda sad. My friends never seems to realize that days like this are going to be difficult for me. Idk if it’s because they haven’t been through trauma or what. I just wish someone would take the time to reach out without me asking. It would mean a lot more. I feel like if I ask right now I’ll be burdening them and I won’t be any fun.

aqsuyq,living with wife who has PTSD - any advice!?,"My wife of 10 months struggles with PTSD and associated anxiety and depression due to childhood abuse and a string of unhealthy relationships that followed her into young adulthood. She is an amazingly strong and caring person, but some days it feels like I can’t do anything right for her. 

For the first few years we were together she was handling things well, or maybe just hiding symptoms from me. Over time her struggles, and ours, have increased and I’ve recently had to accept that I need to do more to support her, and to take care of myself.  

She takes medication, goes therapy and has tried a wide variety of treatment over much of her life. We try talking but the conversations often turn into arguments and we both become defensive. I know that a lot of her reactions and emotions come from her PTSD but it is hard not to be hurt when anger takes over her emotions. I then have to fight to remain calm, and don’t always accomplish that. 

We recently moved to a city close to my home and she is away from friends and family and having a difficult time meeting people. I know plenty of people in the area so our opportunities to socialize without each other are not equal yet. I feel like I’m often the only one she can talk to besides a therapist, and think it’s probably time for me to get one of my own. I’ve never been able to tell my family or friends about her situation because she does not want to be judged for her diagnosis and I respect her wishes. However it’s hard not to talk, and even harder to not be able to occasionally vent about how her PTSD negatively impact me. I don’t want to share with her how hard it can be and cause more guilt than she already feels. But I also feel I should be honest and open about my feelings, as I encourage her to do the same. Anger, negativity and resentment seem to be contagious at times and I wish I knew how to take a step back in those moments. We always apologize but these conversations are sometimes left unattended after. 

I’ve seen my wife at her best but realize this isn’t something we can just address and be done with. I know I can do more big and little things to remind her she is loved and supported, but it often slips my mind until she’s having a difficult time. Not an excuse on my part, but I’m an optimistic person by nature and get stuck in the moment when things are going well. 

When times are tough, she doesn’t think I take her PTSD seriously or truly understand how she feels, and not sure I ever will be able to understand. I want to commit to be better, but it’s scary knowing that this is something I can’t fix and will need to offer support on each and every day. 

If any of you have PTSD, or experience living with someone who does, I’d love to hear what helps. This is my first time on reddit so feeling a little uneasy..

aqsy6f,How do I deal w my partners ptsd related anger and isolation?,"I have been w my boyfriend for 2 years. We plan to get married, buy a house - the whole package. He has two kids that live with us full time (mom has been mia for years) and they are a delight. 


He is rated at 80% disabled from the VA with the majority of that rating from PTSD. Additionally, he had a horrible first marriage that ended 5 years ago and his ex wife completely abandoned them - which I believe he also has some trauma from that he hasn’t completely worked through out. 


He is normally wonderful but when something stressful happens he completely turns. It’s like he snaps. I could say the smallest, most insignificant thing that sets him off during these stressful times and then all of that negativity is turned towards me. He will yell (I have asked countless times not to be yelled at), not admit fault, and then isolate and give me the silent treatment (even though we live together) for days. Eventually he will come around but it is after days and days of what I consider to be emotional abuse. Guys - I have never done one intentionally mean or disrespectful thing to my boyfriend ever yet he treats me like this seemingly on a whim. 


He has recently sought counseling because he knows something is wrong. He has been seeing a counselor for the past month on a weekly basis. But on this Tuesday I come home from work, excited about an idea I had, and when I told him he completely snapped - yelled, screamed, accused me of meaning something that I completely didn’t mean. It’s now Thursday and he still is “punishing” me. He has said “I know what I did was not okay and I’m trying to work through it” but no apology, still the silent treatment, sleeping on the couch, etc. 


I know this is a mental illness caused by experiences out of his control. I know this is not him. I know he is trying to get help. But how tf do I support him in getting healthier when his ptsd causes such destruction and heartache?

aqyeia,really need advice,"my former roommate, who was a coworker, moved in with me when i was abruptly told i could no longer live with my (abusive) stepmother and father. in late december he raped me (check post history for more info if you want it)

i’ve been spiraling since, i’m supposed to return to work tomorrow but i don’t feel ready to face my coworkers who have all been wondering where i am, and my former roommate also disappeared so they’ve been asking me about him.

i’ve barely been functional for the past month and a half, i’ve gone to therapy and handled some legal matters but that’s all i’ve been able to manage. my symptoms are getting worse, i can’t stop shaking, i don’t sleep at all and i think i had my first auditory hallucinations last night, and woke up in a panic almost every 15 minutes. 

weed and alcohol (the alcohol i want to quit but the weed has aways helped me feel calmer and sleep better) is all that’s helped. i’m literally completely out of money (and weed which is all that helps me when i’m in a panic) and people stopped sharing/donating to the go fund me a friend made. i have to go back to work because i NEED money for therapy, rent, and the bills i’ve let go unpaid since december. 

i don’t know what to do, i don’t feel like i can go back to my place of work without having a panic attack. i can barely shower and get dressed so i don’t know if i’d do any better working somewhere else. it’s never been this bad before (i’ve had ptsd for 10+ years), should i go on disability? i have to do something asap because living with a negative account balance and going into debt is making my anxiety even worse.",brattynattylite,2019-02-15 08:39:14,5,313,16.07,9.53,96.16,7.38,26.08,14.38,94.25,56.55,18.53,14.7,13.42,0,0.32,0.64,0.32,3.51,3.83,11.5,15.02,5.43,7.99,3.19,26.52,3.51,3.51,2.24,1.28,2.88,5.43,1.92,3.51,1.6,0.96,0,6.07,0.64,0.96,0.32,0.96,14.38,2.56,1.92,2.56,3.51,2.56,2.88,1.6,0.32,0,0.96,3.83,0.96,2.56,0.32,0.64,7.67,1.6,2.88,0.96,1.28,1.6,7.67,17.57,0.64,15.97,2.56,5.43,8.31,2.56,0.64,1.28,2.56,0,0,0.32,0,0.32,0,0,0,17.57,3.19,3.83,0,0,0.32,0,0,0,6.39,3.19,0.64
aqyu1a,Service Dog/Companion Dog,"A little background: 

So, my brother was in the 101st Airborne in Afghanistan and came back with pretty severe PTSD. He's gotten some help and is mostly functional, but has anxiety attacks, insomnia, major depressive symptoms, and it is still really dangerous trying to wake him up (he can be violent). 

Recently, he and his fiance adopted a dog from a rescue organization. The dog was supposed to be specifically for him and his PTSD, but his fiance didn't give him a say in which dog and didn't even get a dog that met the criteria for an emotional companion dog. She simply bulldozed and went ahead picked one that met her specific needs: a high energy dog she could run with and show off to her friends. 

My brother is obviously hurt and resentful of her blatant selfishness. He is also having trouble connecting to--and not feeling more anxious around--this hyper and super anxious dog. They have a tiny one bedroom in the city, which makes it even worse.

My question is: Are there any organizations in Northern Virginia (Arlington area) that help Veterans train their dog to help them with PTSD? 

I feel like it could become HIS dog if maybe someone came in and helped him train and connect with it. Obviously he and his fiance need to talk about what she did and how it's causing him to feel resentful and angry, but at least this might help him feel less so. He has started drinking more again and he's essentially told my Dad and brother that it's the stress of the situation. 

Any suggestions are appreciated. I love my brother and want him to be happy and healthy.",harukomariko,2019-02-15 09:19:12,3,289,28.11,88.69,1,1,19.27,19.38,89.27,55.36,17.65,12.11,2.42,0,0,8.65,1.04,5.54,4.84,10.38,9.69,6.23,9.69,1.04,17.65,6.23,2.42,1.38,0.69,2.42,8.3,2.42,5.88,1.38,1.73,0.69,18.34,2.77,2.08,2.08,9.34,13.49,2.42,1.38,2.08,4.15,1.73,2.77,2.42,0.35,0.35,1.73,2.08,0.35,0.69,0.35,0.35,10.38,5.88,1.04,3.11,0.69,1.04,5.54,11.07,0.69,9,1.38,5.88,2.08,1.04,0.35,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.19,4.5,3.11,1.04,0,0.35,0,1.38,0,2.08,1.38,0.35

I was wondering if anyone else here has consenting sex with their s/o and cries afterwards? The actual act of sex is fine but afterwards I find myself crying but I have no thoughts going on in my head or actual reason to cry. My s/o feels terrible after when they see me crying. I’ve explained that it’s not their fault and everything, but I can’t understand why I end up crying.

aqzvwr,Secondary trauma from girlfriend’s ptsd,"So my girlfriend has experienced sexual assault, and it has been seriously affecting our relationship. I grew up in a not so good household and lived on my own pretty young, so I feel like I am the one who knows how to do adult things and take care of finances, put things in our google calendar, make sure we wake up on time, etc. Recently i have struggled with that and am feeling burnt out because i work and go to school full time, and also take care of the finances/appointments (she does not work, but she does go to school). I have struggled with depression/suicide my whole life, and I feel like I am definitely feeling secondary trauma from dealing with her ptsd every day (and every night, as she has loud and violent night terrors that keep me up so I usually just don’t sleep). We have been together for over a year and there’s only been a few months where she’s gotten better, and then just went back to her old ways. But recently she also has been unable to have sex which is hard for me because I have really big insecurities around sex (I grew up being told multiple times that I was too ugly to have sex with, by multiple people, so it definitely took a toll on me). I have always tried to be understanding and tell her it’s okay if she can’t, and that we can do what is comfortable for her (so it’s mostly just cuddling), but this is making me feel unattractive and unloved. I don’t know what to do because I am extremely close to having a breakdown because of the burnout, and I know I’m not treating her as well as I can because of it. Should I take a step back and maybe take a break for a while? We live together, so breaking up would be really hard, but in the end, is that the right solution? I’ve read a lot about secondary trauma and I’ve read that it is important to put my mental health first, but I’m worried if I break up with her it will cause her to slip further into her problems and she may start self harming again. Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR Girlfriend has night terrors so I don’t sleep, we don’t have sex anymore, and I’m feeling burnt out from taking care of her, so I am not treating her as well as I can. Is it time to break up? Or is there anything I can do?",throw1away1acct12,2019-02-15 10:57:21,5,438,9.55,35.73,67.62,16.04,27.38,14.16,95.89,63.93,18.95,13.7,8.22,1.6,0,3.88,0,5.25,3.2,12.79,14.38,8.22,11.64,2.05,22.15,4.79,2.51,1.37,0.46,1.83,7.53,3.42,4.11,1.37,0.68,0.23,8.45,0,0.68,3.88,0,12.56,2.74,2.51,1.14,2.51,1.6,3.42,2.74,0,0.23,2.28,2.97,0.68,1.14,1.14,0,10.96,3.2,1.83,3.88,2.05,0.23,2.97,16.89,0.68,14.38,2.05,6.39,5.71,2.05,0,0.23,0.46,0,0.23,0.68,0,0,0.23,0.46,0,14.38,2.51,5.02,0,0.23,0.91,0,0,0,3.42,1.83,0.46

Here is Melody who is five years old trapped inside twenty one year old body. She loves to write, books, music and especially animals.
But there is another side of the story... She has Ptsd 'cause of rape, children abuse, bullying, physical abuse. Everyday was a nightmare for her. She remember every little detail of her past, the bad past... The past started to control her life sec by sec.
She took a blade on her hand one day. Never thought that can harm, in fact maybe it can help more than anything. It can take her pity life from her pity hands. Maybe she can rescue her soul from all the things she went through. Maybe she can love the way she is in the after life. Maybe she will trapped in black endless hole without any noise. Let's figure what can be worse.
She took the blade to her right hand and cut the wrist up to down. See the blood, relaxed, no tears, no regrets, than she sleep. Sleep like never slept.

ar13wm,Sensory Processing Disorder keeps destroying me. Have you beaten it? Please share tips.,"Hi folks. I have sensory processing disorder as a major feature of my autism/ptsd. Certain sounds like loud engines, fireworks, and firearms kick my ass. My mind goes blank, my throat goes lumpy, I panic, and I feel the most pain. Days after exposure I'm still anxious, hypervigilant, depressed, and obsessed with the idea that the sound will come back. I used to get paranoid and psychotic too.

I failed out of school after a guy in my apartment complex got a loud-ass motorcycle and revved it every morning. I turned to alcohol to numb the pain and fucked up my life.

I moved in with the love of my life but our house was in a big city and the fireworks and subwoofers fucked me up. I tried to kill myself and lost the relationship, my job, and my house.

I finally rebuilt my life, again. Yesterday at home I heard a really loud noise that triggered me. I was doing so well and now I feel like shit. If it becomes a regular thing I'll have to move, again. I'm out of money to keep running away.

I always have at least 75dB of white noise running when I'm home. I have earplugs and earmuffs. Yesterday was so loud this didn't help.

ar2as9,My story,"Hi my names Sam and I’m 14. I haven’t got diagnosed with PTSD but I’m showing signs. I don’t know whether I have PTSD or as the psychologist I met said “just normal stress”

Last Easter I was in Gran Canaria in a holiday bungalow when a man came in. He came through the living area when I was in the bedroom. I got up and at first I thought he was a member of staff, until I saw my iPad, my brothers iPad and my dads phone. He was going through to the dinning area to try and get my dads wallet. I confronted him, he tried to get out of the bungalow, I grabbed his arm and tried to hold him there while shouting in my dad. ( my dad was in the bathroom at the time) he turned around and landed a punch to the chest and pushed me to the ground. He then ran out of the bungalow in which I ran after him. He turned left out of the door and ran over gravel. I ran after him barefoot and kept up with him. He ran around the other bungalows but got out through one of the locking side exits. He got away with my dads wallet and my iPad. He dropped the rest when I was chasing him. 

In the days just after the event when I was still in Spain I was physically jumpy. I remember a man with the same complexion walking past me and me almost punching him. 

When looking back on the event I feel angry, about being robbed but more because I didn’t catch him, I also feel guilty about not catching him, I feel like if I ran a bit faster I could have got him. I feel like I should have caught him and beaten or killed him. If I ever see him again I would kill him. No exaggeration. 

I’m hyper vigilant, when I go any where new I’m scanning for threats, if someone frightens me I am very close to attacking them. 

But then there’s a part of my brain that just says to me that I’m milking it. I’m fine, I don’t need any help and I’m just making it up for attention.

ar2d49,Hello everyone 2,"Hello everyone,
So the thing is Melody woke up, she woke up with sadness and disappointment. All her head is going on ""You can't even success to kill yourself, you are worthless"" She was only 14 years old... She didn't even realise and remember what happened to her.
Next day her mom saw the scars on her wrist and got the appointment from psychologist. First diagnose was Bipolar Disorder. It make sense but it didn't fit her at all.
She had so many toxic friends from high school. They were seen like friends but they were always bullying me at the same time. Never been happy, never been loved... They were ""joking"" about her disease all the time.
Then at the age of 16. She met someone. Friends of her friends... Nice guy, handsome... It was enough to trush a guy in 16, teenage years we say. Second date with him, she was afraid if they are going to make it and she realized she is not ready, she was not ready at all. She said no, he said yes. She cried, he laughed. She saw blood, he saw joy. 
Three days, feeling sick, feeling worthless, feeling like a bitch cuz it was her fault, it was... Her fault. She always been the worst, she never felt loved from family, from friends, from boys. She was fat, worthless, cheap, slut, ugly, mental... She didn't deserve anything. 
Those days she wanted to tell someone and she wrote to her best ""male"" friend. He invited her to house to talk, she said ""are you kidding me? I am telling you he raped me and it is not funny."".

ar33cr,Finding out so much about PTSD,"I am M(42).

Was diagnosed almost 2 years ago with PTSD but healing and moving forward is sometimes not the easiest thing to do.

When I was younger I was subject to sexual violence by big boy bullies at my school and I believe that I was also raped. This happened at the school showers when I was 13 so living with this for almost 30 years.

This event has affected my life and probably has caused problems with relationships with friends and my marriage to my wife (which is really awful).

How do you cope?  I go to so much therapy.

In 2017, after the suicide of a friend of mine, my ex boyfriend emotionally abused me into a relationship with him again. In December, he sexually assaulted me (not rape.) I didn't consent but at the time I felt like since he was my boyfriend it was okay. I've come to realize that it wasn't okay and I was violated. 
I have been having horrible nightmares of the incident, of him committing the act in another way, of him being in my life, of everyone dismissing that he was abusive because they liked him (which happened irl.) When I see someone with a patchy beard like him, curly hair like him or a car like him, my heart stops. I cry all the time when I even think of a physical relationship. I have panic attacks even seeing someone with a similar side profile. If I hear his name or see his photo I just relive memories.

 I just wanted to say that ptsd is real and it sucks and that more people should educate themselves on mental health so they can help people like us get better. I feel like PTSD is still massively stigmatized and I have trouble finding specialists around me that specialize in ptsd that can actually help me overcome my ptsd that accept my insurance. I've been battling it for years now and I need some help but have no idea where to get it. My anxiety disorder is crippling me. I'm terrified to seek help because I don't want to be hospitalized forever. I don't trust the organizations designed to help people like me. I'm terrified that hospitals still practice MK ultra in secret and that mentally ill or undesirable minorities are who they test on. I fear in patient hospitals. I fear they do not actually cure people like me and that they test on us like lab rats. After seeing the ""three identical strangers"" documentary, how the hell am I supposed to trust the gov. to actually help people with ptsd? I think I would rather take my chances with a shaman and some ayawascha to help cure myself of my ptsd but I am not sure if that would make my condition worse or not. I have a lot of fear and it's crippling me from living my life to the fullest. If anyone sees or reads this and has any suggestions for me on what to do please tell me.

ar6qg7,Does anyone who uses legal hemp(cbd) for ptsd want to participate in an anonymous data survey in regards to the use of hemp(cbd)?,"A little background I’m the director of Operations for a legal medical marijuana dispensary for about the last 8 years, the doctors I work with have gathered loads of amazing data in regards to mmj over those same years. Last year in a similar capacity a hemp(cbd) company was started and the hemp(cbd) products were added at the dispensary. We have several patients that love the hemp but have also found most medical patients with prescriptions for mj don’t go through the red tape and expenses involved to come to the dispensary to get their hemp since it’s available at several locations nearby without the patient prescription necessary. The doctors would like to do some impersonal studies or data collection in regards to hemp(cbd) and it’s uses, delivery methods, potential benefits, and possible detriments. I’m simply wondering at this point if there would be any interested in participating?
We are about two weeks from rolling out the program which will require submitting a request to participate form as well as filling out a brief survey. There’s no specific disqualifications or commitments. It is a long term study and participants will have access to hemp at or near cost in return for participating. Organic hemp flower at about 1$ a gram as an example. You are more then welcome to join the study and use which ever hemp(cbd) you have found that works. This is about helping to further the industry by legitimacy and data. The data gathered will help to steer the more controlled and clinical study that will take place down the road. Allowing future resources to be used in the most appropriate avenue for possible benefits or detriments to the hemp users. Please pm or send me a chat if interested in participating and I will send you the link in a couple of weeks when available.

Backstory: I'm an alcoholic with 5yrs sober. I'm very honest about this because it's what lead to my trauma. I'm worried I'm going to be treated like a criminal because I've experienced this before.

ar7nik,Flashbacks in dreams?,"Hi everyone. 

So, I haven’t been diagnosed with PTSD, and I have no memories of any traumatic events. But a few times recently I’ve had dreams where my dream-self has flashbacks? Of course they’re rather vague and scattered, as a dream is, but my brain still labels them as “this is you having a flashback.” 

Does that make any sense at all? Should I hold these things in my dreams as having any sort of possible truth?

When I was in, that's how we dealt with things, and now I'm losing my mind as I try to sleep. I miss my brothers and dealing with issues this way. After tonight, I feel like I'm so alienated from all of these friends I've known for 20 years. 

I searched the top posts of the last year and saw no veteran posts within the top 20. I'm not trying to down play any of those posts, but I was hoping I could find a similar situation.

My reaction right now is to still put him in his place and knock his lights out, but I know it's wrong. I've been out for 10 years and these feelings are all just flooding back. I still want to knock his lights out but I know in my friends' eyes I'm some brute.

arcnw5,I feel like I am rationally moving forward but emotionally stuck.,"I really don't know where to talk about this, but I hope people here might have some insight. I've spent 4-5 years in therapy and been trying to recover from a very chaotic and emotionally abusive childhood. I'm grateful to have met some good people and had a therapist who has been trustworthy and empathetic. I know that there are opportunities that I can seize on, and despite there being no guarantee of anything, there's no reason not to try and everybody is nervous about the future.

So rationally I have made great strides in realizing where my thoughts of hopelessness, mistrust, and self-loathing are distortions. But emotionally I feel like I am spinning my wheels. I know that if I take up any new task I will have to learn as a beginner, I know that there are career options available to me if I work hard for them, but emotionally I still avoid things and obsess over every possible thing that can go wrong. I've changed career tracks twice in the last 6 months, mainly because I am utterly terrified of being in an underemployed job section or of committing to something that doesn't work out because I'm not good enough to make it work. I hesitate to even do hobbies I like because I get too afraid of what might go wrong. It's not that something might not work, it's that it will end in catastrophe. I know other people feel these kind of fears too but for me it feels like I am ruled by the fear. So cognitively I can see how fortunate I am and that I have opportunities I can take, but emotionally I am afraid of life. I have read enough to know that people who are obsessed with attaining their goals usually do just through sheer work effort and will power. But I feel like I would never be good enough for it. Is this common for people who were traumatized earlier in life? To obsess over when the other shoe will drop and where it will drop and how heavy the shoe might be and if the ceiling's going to come down with it?

I don't want to feel like this, I want to push myself forward but I guess I feel stuck on how I might do that. Has anyone felt similarly?

ardx8c,I feel like I'm drowning and my doc won't listen,"To start things off - I'm so grateful I found this sub and I really just feel like I need to vent, so apologies for the long rant.

Before my PTSD diagnosis, I suffered for years thinking ""PTSD is for people who get shot at, not someone who had a few bad experiences."" I finally reached a point where I had a breakdown and decided either I get help or take my own life. I decided to get help.

The only thing that kept me going was knowing that help was coming, but now that I'm trying it I'm not so sure. I'm about to experience the most stressful, panic attack inducing week of my life (grad school interviews, a conference, spending the 4 day conference and 20+ driving hours with my PTSD triggering/panic attack inducing boss who lives in his own world of disillusion, presenting and justifying my past years work, and knowing that if I fail everything I've worked towards until now will have been a waste and I can no longer financially support myself) and my doc won't prescribe me anything stronger than an anti-histamine (whixh only increases the feeling that I cant breathe) and a blood pressure medication that not only doesn't work, but causes me to pass out as soon as I get up from bed. 

The interview is on Monday, we leave Tuesday and don't get back until Saturday. I called my psychiatrist and explained everything that was going on and why I didnt like my meds and he told me to hold off until our follow up meeting after I get back. The next week is going to be a constant cycle of every trigger that causes me to break down. 

I didnt plan it this way. I was supposed to go to the conference by myself and not present my work, and I hadnt heard from my dream grad program in 4 months and assumed it was time to move on. Suddenly grad school was back on the table and my boss was forcing me into work that's not in my contract plus added social pressure and it all happened to fall in the same week. I've been a crying mess. My therapist is a great listener but not much else, and all I'm left with is some medications that keep me from breathing and make me pass out.

I’m tired of being afraid of my own father and family friends, I’m tired of believing I deserved it, I’m tired of believing someone’s going to actually get the chance to take what the boy couldn’t get to, and I’m so very tired of fearing every little touch or close contact that I get from male friends or family. 

I don’t want to be afraid anymore. I want to be happy when a male friend put a hand on my shoulder because we were being idiots together, or when my brother-in-law gets close to me or when my father hugs me or kisses my cheek. 

I just want to be a normal teen not having to be so anxious or worried about letting guard down around people. I want to stop seeing things and having moments where I believe I’m the only real person in the world. 

I want to stop hyperventilating and crying because some random thing triggered me at school. I want to remember everything that boy had done to me that day and push through it with my therapist.

arhq9m,Really frustrating triggers,"Potential trigger warning: mention of suicide and depression.






For context, depression runs in my family. My brother committed suicide in April and was severely depressed ever since he was a teenager, he was 26. I have chronic depression and anxiety, not been diagnosed with PTSD but my trauma therapist said I fit the criteria. My triggers are really starting to annoy me. I follow r/Anxiety and sometimes there are posts that aren't related to anxiety and are depression or suicidal thoughts related and it's really starting to trigger me. I get really upset when people mention depression or feeling suicidal and it's starting to make me just not give a shit at all. Although, take away the triggers and I still don't really care if someone is depressed as my mind always thinks ""clearly not as depressed and my dead fucking brother was"" and I just lack empathy for most. Yes I'm a terrible person. It's just really starting to bother me. I had to unfollow r/depression because of how triggering it was and now I think I need to do the same for r/Anxiety. I don't want to because I like to help people sometimes or share my own stories to make people feel less alone but it's really starting to mess with my head, especially since people never put trigger warnings if they mention anything suicide related or they just post about their depression without even mentioning their anxiety. This subreddit is perfectly fine as you lovely people put trigger warnings but more often than not it is SA related which I don't often get triggered by talking about or seeing people talk about it. Maybe I'm being dramatic and stupid but it's really starting to get to me. It's not a super bad trigger but it's enough to make me cry or angry as well since people on r/Anxiety don't seem to follow the rules. Sorry for whining it just doesn't feel good since it's all still so raw and I'm only just getting treatment for my trauma and I hate when people don't follow basic rules.

arjxlb,How to self manage PTSD from childhood?,"Hi everyone,

Long story short, I had a shitty childhood with a very narcissistic mother who broke all my self-esteem and all that jazz. I had some serious talk with my father recently - confronting him about my mother's abusing behaviors. I thought he did not have knowledge about it and simply left for another woman. However, it turned out that he knew about her unstable personality yet left me with her anyway. It really hurts knowing this piece of information. 

I am trying to survive on my own somehow and tbh, I am quite young and not doing a good job. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I could still hear her yelling screeching voice in my head and all my nightmares involve her somehow. I went for a therapist and some meds for this but it never really goes away. I have been diagnosed with depression with melancholic features, too and eventually ptsd from childhood. 

I hope to have some tips to self-manage the symptoms and all until I get my shit together and go see a therapist again.

Thanks A lot &lt;3

ark287,emotional flashbacks...,"hi everyone,

after being raped when I was 17, I developed PTSD, but over time the daily visual flashbacks turned into nightmares which changed to emotional flashbacks. I’m confused because I have every single symptom of CPTSD, especially the toxic shame, feeling worthless and defective, difficulty regulating my emotions, but I know this doesn’t constitute a diagnosis, and I also have no history of long-term abuse which I know is required for CPTSD. it’s just weird having these extremely intense emotional flashbacks where out of nowhere I will feel so indescribably filthy, disgusting, and shameful and it’s incredibly painful, but I don’t have any visual imagery when it happens. I’ve only read about emotional flashbacks in relation to CPTSD, so is it possible that they can also go along with PTSD?",beauty_for_ashes613,2019-02-17 04:16:27,0,134,11.09,13.14,86.48,1,26.8,29.1,86.57,53.73,16.42,8.96,8.21,0,0,0,0.75,7.46,2.24,10.45,11.94,8.96,10.45,2.99,17.91,6.72,0.75,3.73,1.49,2.24,12.69,0,11.94,2.24,1.49,0.75,2.24,0,0,0,0,14.18,4.48,1.49,0,2.24,3.73,2.24,2.99,0.75,0,2.24,3.73,0,2.99,0.75,0,5.97,1.49,0,3.73,0,0.75,2.24,12.69,0.75,12.69,2.24,5.22,5.22,2.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.4,4.48,8.96,0,0,0.75,0,0.75,0,4.48,0,0

arl64b,Had such a good week last week and now going downhill since vday,"I had such a good week last week, I was sleeping ok, eating ok, had positive one on one and group sessions, I really felt like I was finally getting a grip on things. It's been almost a year since my diagnosis.

Then after Valentine's, the nightmares started again much harder than before. I am used to waking up scared once a night, but now it's two or three dreams a night. They aren't memories or flashbacks but feelings. Dreams of powerlessness, loss, not being able to save someone or save myself, not being able to fight back. I didn't have a good Valentine's day but I had to pretend I did for my kids. In reality I felt so isolated and alone but I had to act like I was having so much fun.

I'm feeling so tired. I feel spent. I feel like I haven't even slept at all. I don't have any energy to get out of bed, to make breakfast, to take my meds. I don't even know what the dreams were last night but ive been crying for hours.  I feel broken.

Dammit I was doing better. I just want to stop feeling scared.

arlna5,feeling like an imposter,"trigger warning for attempted suicide 

about a year and a half ago i tried to kill myself because of a disagreement with my mom that, to anyone else, would have seemed like a really small thing. even to myself i feel like i overreacted really badly, but after three days of panic attacks and high-key anxiety and spiralling (over such a tiny thing!), i really found no other way to go on. 

on the morning after my attempt, my psychiatrist asked me what was going on, and i explained something that my mom did to me when i was 15 (i'm now almost 25) that was extremely upsetting and has followed me to this day. 

my psychiatrist said i had ptsd. but it was one event. it was horrible, i'm still fucked up over it, but my mom didn't hit me or even verbally abuse me. she's done a few terrible things, including one thing in 2016 that was almost as bad as what she did a decade ago. but no actual physical harm. just a lot of emotional distress.

to this day, if my mom is even slightly displeased with me, i get incredibly upset and usually start crying. but i still feel like an imposter for saying i have ptsd when others have been through so much worse. i don't know what i'm looking for. reassurance, commiseration? how do i deal with feeling like this?",AutomaticSquash,2019-02-17 07:43:32,1,242,23.66,6.33,97.74,1,16.13,15.7,91.32,63.64,21.9,13.22,12.4,0,0,0.83,0,8.68,4.55,14.46,9.92,8.26,8.26,1.65,18.6,6.2,4.13,2.48,2.89,1.24,8.26,0.41,7.85,2.48,1.65,0.41,4.96,1.65,0,2.48,0,13.64,3.31,1.24,0.83,3.72,0.41,5.79,2.89,0.41,0.83,1.65,0.83,0,0.41,0.41,0,4.96,0,0.41,2.89,0.41,1.24,9.09,7.85,0.41,13.22,1.24,4.55,7.44,0,0,0,0,0,0.83,0.41,0.41,0,0,0,0,15.7,4.96,4.96,0,0,0.83,0.41,0.41,0,2.48,1.65,0

I also don't feel like I can talk about it, especially to people who don't have PTSD because I assume that would make them feel even more awkward about talking about it. It's hard enough trying to explain to someone and have them not pity you, not to mention it always seems to end any conversation when you bring it up.

arp5uo,Can someone make sense of me?,"I have PTSD due to childhood trauma, and have been in and out of therapy for about 4.5 years. I graduated from therapy a couple of years ago after extensive EMDR around a parent's psychotic breakdown when I was three. I had life changing benefits and I no longer find myself returning to that trauma or that set of negative cognitions about myself. However, this winter I have been descending into worse depression than ever before. I returned to therapy and it seems I am now dealing with trauma from time spent in foster care after the original event. My PTSD episodes are worse than they ever have been. I am dealing with intense feelings of worthlessness, of being unwanted. I am aware that I'm re-experiencing the time in foster care. My little girl is in my head constantly screaming for mommy and daddy. I can barely function. I mostly can't.

This is coming up a lot in my work life. I'm approaching the end of a temporary position, and I really love it. I'm feeling horribly abandoned and unwanted as this job comes to an end. I can't reasonably blame my employer or colleagues. I have applied for permanent jobs with no success. I've seen jobs created for other people in my position when they were being timed out, but no one has offered to do this for me. I have mentioned to my boss that I would like to stay, and his response was something about needing me to do more ambitious projections. I can't tell if the projects are a test, and if I do well I might be able to stay, or if he just wanted me to be able to accomplish some good stuff before I leave. I don't like the idea of being tested. And doing projects for their own sake might be fun if I were in a different mindset, but feeling like it's a test is really stressful.

My T wants me to have a conversation with the boss where I specifically say that I want to stay and ask if there's any way it's possible. I really can't do that. All I want to do is hide. And throw up. And sleep. I am now triggered over and over again at work. Where previously work was a situation where the ""little girl"" would not take over, I am now seesawing. The trauma feelings will recede for a time, then I remember I'm at work and have to leave soon, and ""Nobody wants me. Nobody cares about me,"" comes back up and I feel like I'm dying. The other day at work I caught myself seriously considering crawling under my desk which is humorous, but also this is how intense it is.

I'm feeling really invalidated that my T and others think I can navigate this situation by having a conversation and advocating for myself. I have grown a lot in this job and have gone way out of my comfort zone in self-advocacy. I have pitched projects and thrown my hat in the ring for jobs, volunteered for things, spoken up about ideas, etc., etc. And I'm just so tired. I feel it has stretched me but not really gotten me where I want to be. It has not changed my belief that I am dispensable and not the kind of person that can receive mentoring or support in the workplace. (Why? I don't know.) I am struggling because I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to commit suicide, but I keep imagining my death like, ""I know it's not my time to go but I wish it were."" I am not in danger of killing myself, but going on day after day with no will to live is exhausting and I'm so mad at myself because it's like I'm watching myself waste my life day after day.

I had a therapy appointment this week that triggered all of this. It's been four days and I can't get right. I've tried texting my therapist and it sort of seemed like it became an argument? At any rate, I didn't feel like she understood how desperate I am feeling. She made some self help suggestions and offered an early appointment that I can't use. I don't feel like I can keep contacting her because I feel stupid and ashamed for not being able to cope. I also tried a suicide prevention chat line, but it didn't work for me at all. The counselor just kept rephrasing my statements back to me, and when I pointed that out, they said that was how they do things. I don't know what I'm looking for, but I feel like I don't make any sense and no one can understand what I'm going through. I'm crushed all day long with intense feelings of fear and grief. I wake up in the morning disappointed to be alive. I just want to be accepted and have meaningful work in my life, but I don't seem to have the skills to do that. Or the world works in some different way than I understand and I can't make the leap. I just really don't understand how people can march into someone's office and demand a job, but that seems like how it works at my job? I feel so broken.

I hate what happened to me in childhood. I'm so angry that this is my life. I feel cheated out of normal human experiences of fitting in and being able to make a contribution to the world.",Chimmychimmychubchub,2019-02-17 13:14:56,0,937,22.36,3.92,98.83,9.86,15.36,15.47,94.13,61.9,20.28,14.19,13.13,0,0,0.53,0.53,6.08,3.95,14.19,12.17,5.66,8.11,3.52,21.34,3.09,2.67,1.81,0.53,1.49,4.91,1.81,3.09,0.64,0.85,0.53,4.59,0.32,0.11,0.64,0.32,16.76,4.48,2.35,2.13,3.52,0.85,5.55,2.88,0.32,0.53,1.6,2.03,0.32,1.6,0,0,6.3,0.85,2.24,2.24,0.75,0.75,4.27,17.4,1.39,14.19,2.35,6.83,5.55,3.84,0.21,0,0.11,0.11,0.75,0.11,0,0,0,0.11,0,15.15,6.19,2.99,0,0,0.43,0,0.21,0.64,4.48,0.21,0

I know this is going to sound stupid, but I went to the hospital on the day Stephen Hawkin died and I feel like I somehow killed him. It's an irrational thought, I am aware, but it doesn't stop me from feeling this way. 

  
I typically hang out in r/writing because that's what I love to do the most, but ever since I was put on a mood stabilizer for BP I and PTSD I feel completely flat. This is on top of my diagnoses of GAD &amp; ADD/ADHD. I upped my dosage on dr's orders thinking it would help, but I think I'm just at a point in my life where I can't feel anything.   


It doesn't help that I lost my dog and my cousin within two weeks of each other, and around the time of my PTSD inducing event.   


I'm looking for advice on how to move forward. I don't know if I'm grieving and in one of the steps of grief, or if perhaps it's medication induced. I see my therapist this week and next month I see my psych. I'm having a hard time working. People were gossiping about me on the first day, as I approached them I heard them talking about me, so I already feel awkward at the job.   


I'm just unsure as to get back into writing, and I'm afraid to post to writing because they get a million ""lost my motivation"" posts and it clogs up the stream, but nobody mentions mental illness in their posts, so I don't want to just get told to ""just write"" because I can't.   


I'm having a hard time enjoying anything. I've also stopped smoking cannabis, which helped me cope with everything since the PTSD inducing incident, maybe not cope, but mask, I'm not sure. Either way, I'm at a standstill in my life and any advice on how to move forward would be most appreciated.   


I appreciate your time. Have a good day/evening.

I feel like school doesn't even matter, but if I were to keep living, without school I'll be nothing and have no one.

    For the first time in 3 years I saw the person who caused my trauma. I thought they had left the area I live so I was very surprised and unprepared to see them again. I am so paranoid and panicky and I have been avoiding leaving my house. I feel so incredibly ashamed and weak because it's like he is still in control of me. I am currently in therapy and would normally just wait for my session but I was asked on a date that is happening before my session. I really like this person and click with them which is quite hard for me to do with the whole PTSD thing. I feel so excited and normal when I think about the date but that quickly turns to panic because I keep imagining him showing up at the restaurant or finding out he works at the restraunt. I know if I cancel I will feel even more suffocated by him than I do now so it can't be an option.

arssjd,"My girlfriend is a CSA survivor and doesn't want to talk about it (NSFW, no abuse details)","Before I start, I know I can't make her talk about it, nor would I want to. I'm not a csa survivor but I have been traumatized in other ways and I know she has to make the decision to talk about it on her own because that's how it has been for me too. And because this will become necessary to mention later, we are lesbians.

She told me about a month ago and hasn't brought it up since. She said she had never told anyone before me, aside from calling the RAINN hotline a few times. Before we were together she was with her previous partner for 9 years and I don't think she ever told her since she said I was the first person.

She has a higher libido than I do and can have as many orgasms as she wants basically, while I max out at two a day at the very most. Sometimes we will be having sex and I just know I'm not going to be able to orgasm, so I'll stop her. Every time this has happened she gets very mad at me, turns away, and won't speak to me for a few hours and sometimes days. I think it was the second or third time this happened I begged her to talk to me about what was happening and why she was getting to angry at me over something I couldn't control and she said it was because her whole life everyone has only wanted her for sex, and when I don't have an orgasm she feels that I don't find her desirable. No matter what I said I couldn't make her believe that we are just physically different when it comes to sex and I literally just get sensitive faster than she does, she couldn't believe anything other than it was that I don't desire her.

The last time this happened she was angry at me for two or three days and it was unbearable, she said we should have just stayed friends because we were sexually incompatible (me not being able to have an orgasm doesn't happen frequently). After things went back to normal I asked her if she really meant that and she said no and hugged me and apologized. Even so, I started doing everything I could think of to make sure I had an orgasm when we had sex. Today however, I just couldn't. As with the other times, she went to the bedroom and turned away from me. I asked if she was mad at me and she said no, I asked her to talk about it and she wouldn't. I started crying and it hit me that this almost definitely has something to do with her being a csa survivor so I asked her ""does this have anything to do with what you told me that night?"" and she shrugged. I told her that I knew she didn't want to talk about it but that it was hurting her to not (paternalistic I know, I shouldn't have said that).

I don't even know what I'm looking for in posting this. I thought about calling the RAINN hotline myself or an lgbt hotline because everything I can find for partners of csa survivors assumes you are a man if you have a female partner. My girlfriend is suffering and I don't know what to do. I'm crossposting this in other subs because I feel almost desperate for feedback.",heirloomapplecandle,2019-02-17 19:40:07,1,599,5.32,44.03,35.05,14.29,23.96,13.52,95.99,68.28,27.05,18.7,10.02,1.17,0.5,7.01,0,8.35,3.84,12.19,13.36,6.18,8.35,4.67,24.54,3.84,2.5,1.67,1.17,1,2.5,0.83,1.67,0.17,0.83,0.5,15.86,0,1,7.35,0.17,16.19,3.51,2.5,3.17,2.84,1.5,4.34,2.17,0.17,1.5,0.5,2.34,0.83,0.33,2,0,5.68,2.5,1.17,1,0.83,0.17,8.68,13.69,1,11.02,1.67,3.17,6.68,0.33,0,0.17,0,0,0,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,0,12.19,3.84,2.84,0,0,0.17,0,0,0.33,4.01,1,0

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, people of this subreddit. First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.

This is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):

A couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.

Then, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to ""listen to her point of view because she had listened to me."" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our ""conversation."" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.

At some point in this ""conversation"" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say ""No"" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said ""nice talking to you guys."" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.

In the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way ""there"".  

I'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways. I don't know if what I'm going through is normal, or even PTSD, but I know that what happened changed my whole ""me"" in ways I have never experienced before. In any case, thanks for reading, and I appreciate any support anyone might be able to offer.",bluewhale3030,2019-02-17 19:57:36,2,1028,40.49,29.28,94.4,6.37,18.69,16.63,93.87,60.31,21.01,13.81,10.99,0.49,0.29,1.46,0.58,7.2,5.45,14.3,9.53,5.25,6.32,1.95,20.43,3.7,1.95,2.53,1.07,2.72,5.45,1.85,3.6,0.39,0.39,1.07,9.53,0,0.97,1.46,0.39,13.91,3.79,2.04,1.46,3.89,1.46,2.82,4.57,0.39,1.75,2.14,1.07,0.68,0.29,0,0.1,6.52,2.24,1.65,1.46,0.49,0.88,10.41,6.91,0.97,15.86,2.04,7.68,6.32,0.39,0,0.39,0.1,0,0.1,0.1,0,0.1,0,0,0,17.12,5.25,6.32,0.1,0.29,0,0,0.39,1.36,1.65,0.88,0.88

arxtmr,Resources for people in relationships with those suffering from PTSD,"I am in a relationship with a young man with PTSD &amp; what  I believe to be complex trauma. He's a trans man who was sexually abused and raped as a child by his neighbor... this neighbor was an adult when my partner was a young elementary-aged girl (pre transition). The neighbor did heinous things to my partner which included creating child pornography of my beloved boyfriend. Typing out this sentence makes my eyes well up with tears. The past two days I have woken up to him having body-thrashing nightmares where he's sleep talking, over and over repeating ""please, no... please, no... God, please, no...."". He told me these nightmares are all of real life events. My heart breaks for him when I witness them, and I do my best to gently wake him up so he can escape this relived nightmare.

arza6m,My ptsd is apparently ruining my bf’s life,"I got in a car crash 10 years ago that triggered ptsd. It wasn’t the worst car crash but the what if’s were enough to send me into a tailspin of anxiety. I was with my family including my 2 year old and my 2 week old baby. We were t-boned and flipped the car. I was the only one that was a bit hurt but it could have been a lot worse. 
So fast forward to now, I can’t be in a car for an extended amount of time. When I get in my whole body locks up and braces for impact. My mind races and shows me all these scenarios of what could happen and how I could die in a crash. My bf doesn’t care to understand. Or maybe I should just say he doesn’t care. He says  my ptsd holds him back from experiencing life and traveling/taking road trips. He knew when we met what he was in for. Nothing has changed. He says he’s just grown tired of it. So now he’s given me an ultimatum, either “get over” my ptsd or move out. He’s giving me 30 days to get out with our son.

as31eo,How can I help the best way I can?,"I've been dating a woman for the last year in a long distance relationship. She was up front with me that she wanted things to move very slow, and I'm absolutely okay with moving at her pace. Early on she was open with me that she has PTSD and she has not shared anything more than that other than traumatic events occurred in her past. While we were dating there were many times she would flake on plans, ignore phonecalls, etc. due to serious anxiety flare-ups and just shut down completely.

There are so many moving parts to this but I will try my best to get to the point. Initially we had planned many times to meet up and they never saw fruition. When we first started dating she thought she was ready but that was not the case and she wants time to heal before considering meeting me and continuing this. Which I fully support. After the fact, I could tell she wanted this earlier on. I gather that she has been afraid to say anything in fear that I would leave her (she had told me this is fear she had from the start).

Is there anything I can do from a distance to help her? Is there anything I should avoid? She has not opened up to me about her trauma, and I dont want to ask that of her. We are still talking as friends. But should I reassure her in any way that I'm here if she wants to talk about anything? Are there any books I can read that would help me to better understand from her perspective? Are there any books that have helped you in the past with healing? And if space is the best thing I can do, I'm fine with that too. I just want to be the best man I can for her.

I’ve spent 15 years working on it. It has improved so very much. But I still get vivid intense nightmares three times a week. I’m still triggered by things that remind me of my trauma. But over all, I’m functioning. 

I started a new job a little over a months ago. It’s in a very busy part of town that has a severe homeless problem. At work yesterday, a homeless drug addicted woman came into my shop and sexually harassed me. I thought she was trying to get a rise out of me so I’d leave her alone and she could steal things. I stood my ground and was proud of myself. Though I did not comfort her. 

I went on my lunch break sometime later. Ran into the same women on the corner, under a blanket with a homeless guy. She cat called me very aggressive and graphically. She asked if I was offended. I said I was. She told me to take it as a compliment and “smile more”. That I was asking for it. 

I responded by telling her to never come back into my shop again. (And a loud “fuck you”). I grabbed my lunch and went back into the shop. Told my boss. She backed me up. Told me she was proud of me. 

It was really shaky. Feeling physically nauseous. But I had a few smokes and worked on my breathing. I never did eat my lunch. But I didn’t have to go home for the day! I was crazy anxious, but I didn’t have to take my emergency ativan! And I made it through my shift with out incident.

as59lf,My nightmares are becoming concerning/does Prazosin help you?,"Hi all. My nightmares are becoming undeniably out of control. I have slept walked/talked, and even texted in my sleep for years. Last night I had a next level, BAD nightmare and “woke up” in a panic, sent my boyfriend some very concerning texts that I have no memory of sending, and woke up this morning to the aftermath. My text messages I sent included things that I don’t feel and would never say while I was awake. I am scared to go to sleep. 

I had taken a Xanax before I went to sleep because my nightmares have been so bad lately and I wanted a peaceful night, but then all of that happened. My dr gave me prazosin, but I am terrified it will make me stop dreaming all together. My nightmares are bad (clearly), but my good dreams, which I get once a month if I’m lucky, are so so good, and I am so afraid of never being able to dream again. I remember every detail of my dreams, vividly, and I have 3-5 separate dreams every night. I have tried taking it twice and it made me very lightheaded, and combined with my sleep walking that can be an issue, but I legitimately can not function with my nightmares how they are.

(I’ll never forget the hurt from that).. years go by with in and out inpatient stays in the hospital but then I was doing GREAT! ... and then I went to college. My roommate was just like my dad and was so manipulative it was like living with him when I was in elementary school again. When things were the worst. No one listened to me when I would tell the hall director or especially the RA. My life has fallen apart and now I’m struggling more than ever before. I have a panic attack at just the thought of going to an appointment. Everything is such a big deal for me to do. Every step of leaving to go somewhere is pointless to me. Any advice? Any help? Or just encouraging words would be nice.

as5snx,"I need advice, 2/17/19 should have been my final day alive and I dont know how to cope","Backstory (optional)

Let me introduce myself, I'm a 17 year old male from northeastern USA. I don't think there's very much special about me to note so I will just get right into what I need to say. On 2/17/19 I was with my friends doing typical teenage stuff like going to the mall, visiting pet shops to see animals, and fooling around at Walmart. Walmart was our final spot we went to before it was time to drive everyone home for the night. My one friend who sat in the passengers seat needed to be home by 11:00pm so we were in a rush to get her home so she would not get in trouble (strict parents). At 11:02pm 2/17/19 we crashed into a metal guard rail going anywhere between 50-75mph and ended up flipping our vehicle 3 times and moving about 75 feet from where we initially made contact with the guard rail. There were 5 people in the car. The driver, passenger, and rear driver seats were all using seatbelts. I sat in the rear passenger seat without a seatbelt and my friend in the middle seat was not wearing a seatbelt either. (I know we should have worn seat belts I literally always wear it, I have always been terrified of being in cars that arent driven by me and this happened to be the one time I wasnt wearing it). We were all taken to the emergency room and we all survived luckily without major injuries. I dont understand how I survived or why, the car we were in was a 2018 so it had some very good safety features like curtain airbags (this is a major factor in how im alive) but there are so many other factors that went into this and ive been through them a million times in my head. I walked away from this accident alive with only full body soreness and multiple cuts from glass but that was it. I know now how scary death is and I never want to come as close as I did that day, if anything went differently everyone in the car would be dead.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ever since then I've watched the accident happen over and over again, I can vividly hear my friends screaming as we hit that guard rail and my one friend screaming after we got out of the vehicle about her head. It terrifies me and no matter what I do nothing keeps me occupied. I've tried watching a movie, drawing, playing video games, listening to music, etc. and I dont feel motivated to do anything. I dont want to talk to anyone really, no one understands what im going through even the other passengers in the vehicle. I turned off all notifications on my phone because it was bothering me that other people wanted to talk to me about stupid stuff like typical small talk. Ive always been very social and eager to talk to anyone but its just not like that anymore. I dont feel motivated to do anything at all and thats why im venting over reddit i guess and to hopefully connect with someone else who would understand what im feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone out there relate to this? I just need help and I dont know what im suppose to do to feel normal again. I have sat in my room the entire day today doing absolutely nothing and I feel like im going insane. All i can see when my eyes wander away to the wall is the crash and then the screams follow. I know ptsd cannot be diagnosed this early but i dont know what else to call this. I apologize if this does not fit in this subreddit, I know nothing about reddit really so feel free to redirect me somewhere where this post would fit better.",rB78293,2019-02-18 19:20:44,18,673,29.77,24.24,89.06,23.45,23.21,14.41,87.82,57.8,19.17,11.74,9.36,1.78,0,0.45,0.15,7.28,4.31,13.97,10.85,6.54,6.69,3.42,20.8,4.16,1.93,2.53,3.27,1.78,2.82,1.34,1.49,0.45,0.3,0,7.73,0.15,0.89,0.45,0.15,15.3,3.12,1.93,2.38,2.67,2.67,3.71,3.12,1.04,1.19,0.89,1.93,1.34,0.74,0,0,6.98,3.12,1.04,1.19,1.19,0.74,5.5,12.63,1.19,15.01,2.82,6.98,5.05,0.3,1.34,1.04,0.3,0,0.74,0.45,0,0.3,0.15,0,0,36.26,4.01,2.38,0.3,0.3,0.15,0,25.85,0,0.74,1.19,1.34
as5x3a,I don't know what to do (potential trigger?),"So I was hit by a car going 70mph 4 years ago, from it I haven't felt enjoyment or happiness I fake smiles when I'm with family and my girlfriend when in reality I'm just lost inside my own head I feel very alone most days and have developed and overwhelming fear of death and on top of that the fear of death is getting to the point where I don't go out because of what could happen. If I'm in a car I would imagine the driver swerving into the incoming traffic and I would see the outcome in my head in detail which makes me uneasy obviously, to the point where I will reach for whatever I can hold on to usually the door inconspicuously so the driver wouldn't think I'm strange, same if I'm walking near a road and a car comes up from behind I move in as much as I can and in some cases clench my fist or even jerk my arm back as if I'm going to launch a punch?. I struggle to watch shows or movies now as I'm not paying attention rather just staring through the screen this lasts for about 3 seconds after I notice I'm doing it and as is the same in work as I work I just kind of stare into nothingness. Every so often the memory of the accident would play in my head and it's as if I can't change the thought until a certain point in the memory. It's sad and it's scary and I feel alone I don't really feel like I'm on the same wavelength as other people if that makes sense? I just can't relate to anyone any more and it makes me feel bitter I don't really care about life not that I'm suicidal it's more of a what's the point.

as6w97,I am afraid to go to sleep,"Hello. My name is Alice. I am 15 years old. When i was 12 I was trained by red cross to do first aid for more common accidents and injury seen around a city. I didn't think that I would actually need to use the skills I learned until a year later when I saw an 11 year old girl get hit by bus. I rushed over immediately to help and started doing the first aid Ieanred. It all happened so fast yet every second felt like an hour. It was a busy street in rush hour, and a crowd formed almost immediately. I felt each and every eye of the bystanders watching mg every move in a mix of horror and shock at what they were seeing. I was there at 13 holding an 11 year old girl in mg arms screaming and crying as she probably died. The ambulance arrived before I could fully do my job so I let the pros do their work. 

2 things really bug me. 
1. I never got the closure of what happened to this girl. I think I know she died, because the speed of the bus and the fact she went under both wheels. But I need that closure that I'll never get

2. I can never sleep at night. Knowing I have to relive the experience over and over and over until I wake up and cry. I don't want to sleep anymore. I stay up as late as I can every night hoping I don't have to experience it again.

as7fe0,I should not be a firefighter.,"Trauma unrelated. I got into a firefighter course by accident and it's a little late to back out. I got sponsored for it and I went along with it. We've been going over a lot of stuff and apart from getting episodes from the feeling of breathing through an SCBA and becoming borderline narcoleptic in class due to my meds, it's been really enjoyable. I say that without sarcasm. The facilities are great, the flexibility is admirable, and the people are...well, they're well-intentioned and I'm not about to badmouth them for their social skills. I really like this program.

But I really shouldn't be a firefighter.  Even if I had all of the procedures mastered and all the material memorized, I'd still be a liability. Like I said, the air masks throw me into episodes. And while I'm getting better at keeping it together, it's far from an acceptable level. Sometimes it's just a change in my voice, sometimes it's a complete shutdown where all I can do is blankly stumble around and sob. While the latter hasn't happened in the mask yet, I'm not exactly sure how well I'll hold up in a burning building with people yelling over the radio and with other people's lives on the line. I think I can scrape by in training, but I really don't think I should be on the actual firegrounds.

It feels like a waste to learn this and not use it, but I don't really see a better option. Until I can keep my shit together, I don't think I'm going to improve the situation. I'm not saying no forever, but I don't think I'm ready yet.",ptsdThrowaway019,2019-02-18 22:36:34,2,286,39.08,4.36,98.36,71.69,15.89,18.18,90.21,62.94,16.78,11.54,10.49,0.35,0,0,0.7,5.24,9.09,14.34,13.64,6.29,6.99,4.55,22.03,1.75,1.75,0.7,0,1.4,6.64,4.55,2.1,0,1.05,0.35,4.55,0,0,0,0,17.48,3.85,1.4,1.75,2.1,2.45,6.64,3.85,0.35,2.1,1.4,1.4,0.7,0.7,0,0,6.29,1.4,1.75,1.4,2.45,0.35,3.5,15.03,1.05,14.69,2.1,8.74,4.2,1.75,0.35,0,0,0,0,1.4,0.35,0,0,1.05,0,19.93,7.34,4.55,0,0,0,0,0.35,0,7.69,0,0

asbjy6,Vet with PTSD character,"Trigger warning: I'll be mentioning major and possible symptoms of PTSD.

Hey guys! I'm writing a story (just for hobby) in which one of the characters is a veteran with PTSD (I don't have PTSD). If you've got the time and feel like it, I would very much appreciate your insight on some questions I have. 

I've done some research, and it seems to me like this condition is extremely diverse in that everyone experiences it a little differently, and it often overlaps with other diagnoses... So yeah please help me out haha.

1. **Can you have spontaneously appearing intrusive thoughts that aren't flashbacks?** Thoughts that aren't directly related to one's specific traumatic experience, but are somehow negative, fucked-up, maybe violent thoughts or even fantasies? Do you need to be stressed in the moment in order for such thoughts to appear, or can they become a casual occurence?
2. **Do you visualize intrusive thoughts similarly to flashbacks?** So, assuming you DO have intrusive thoughts... Can they be as visual or ""real"" as flashbacks?
3. **Do you think of anything when you dissociate?** Do you have intrusive thoughts WHILE you dissociate? Or any thoughts? What are they about? Do you only dissociate in stressful situations, or spontaneously?
4. **Do you or have you ever had problems recalling a certain aspect, or the entirety, of your traumatic experience? Is this possible in general?**

asf42b,"Every time I close my eyes, I see the gun pointed in my face","Trigger warning: Domestic violence

&amp;#x200B;

My goddaughter's father is a violent schizophrenic who refuses medication and enjoys alcohol and recreational drugs such as Xanax, exacerbating his already fragile mental state. He has physically abused my best friend throughout their relationship, even knocking her out a few times while she was pregnant. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day, me and K (my friend) leave the baby with him at my dorm while we go run errands. (Yes, I understand how foolish this was in hindsight, but it was wintertime with a high of 20 degrees and we didn't want to bring a three month old outside). My dorm was stocked with everything he needs, diapers, wipes, formula, and the works. He calls her about two hours later, screaming that the baby won't be quiet and he's going to kill her so K needs to come home. We order a cab - five minute waiting time turns into thirty due to the weather conditions. When we enter, we expect to see a bloodbath. Instead, the baby is unharmed. He starts to beat my friend up. Starts hitting her with the gun. Drags her out in the hallway.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, he grabs the baby. He has my goddaughter in one hand and the gun in the other. I try to grab the baby from his arms and he points the gun right in my face. I remember taking a few feeble steps back and putting my hands in the air. I felt like I was floating in the room after that. I felt like I was watching everyone from afar, or from the ceiling. I felt so disconnected from reality. Sounds were muffled. From that moment, I felt no fear. My heart wasn't beating fast, I wasn't shaken, I was just... there. I remained calm the entire time. Didn't make any noises. I think that, coupled with my goddaughter miraculously not letting out a single cry or yelp throughout the whole ordeal, saved all of our lives. All he had to do was move his index finger and we all would have died. I forget why he decided to put the gun down, but once he did that, he tossed the baby on the bed (she had a heavy snowsuit on and was not physically injured as a result), but my friend grabbed the baby and ran to a different floor. She was crying in the bathroom. I was still in my withdrawn state, and I recall telling her, ""let's act like nothing happened."" I had to go back in the room and he is still there. He says he wants the sweater he let K wear back, or he's going to beat her up again. Not even ten minutes after he tried to kill me, I had to be the middleman in delivering clothes and returning other belongings to them. I didn't want him to get riled up again. I did what I was told.

asfk8g,Sunshine and Rainbows Partner doesn't get it,"Sorry, this isn't quick. I need to explain.

I've PTSD for a long time (caused by the death of two boyfriends, two children, cancer twice, childhood sexual abuse, physically and mentally abusive marriage - the list is just ridiculous). I had it under control, then I was involved in a car accident. I was stopped for backed up traffic, the person behind me hit me at 75 mph, spun me across the interstate and rolled down the embankment. Woke up hanging from my seatbelt and my friend paralyzed (temporarily, but didn't know that then). It stirred up things I had settled. Went to therapy, got everything settled (again).

Fast forward to a year ago - I get with this great guy. Things are going very well and I'm finally happy. I start having paid from the cart accident again and I go to the doctor for a few more months. I find out I have a permanent injury they can't fix, amd the pain is persistent. This affects my 12 year career, changes so much for me, and I have trouble leaving it behind like I could work everything else because it's THERE every damn day. 

Enter more PTSD: angry, irritable, need quiet time to calm down but I never get any, feel overwhelmed all day every day, and I never get a break from it. Wonderful boyfriend isn't so wonderful anymore. He's one of those people who have had a mostly charmed life and never had to deal with anything especially hard besides the regular punches of life. I need his support, I need him to curb the triggers that he's able to. I need extra help while I get my shit straight again. But, he doesn't do what I tell him I need, then gets angry with me when I'm not able to keep things together (housework, cooking, laundry, my demeanor). I've told him how paralyzing it can be. I don't know if I haven't explained it the right way, or if he just doesn't care. I'm back in therapy, but every time I get a smidge better he's to the point he wants  to break up with me and causes a setback.

How would you handle this? How do you explain it so a complete outsider understands? How can I explain that the quicker he supports me the quicker we can get back on track without making it sound like it's completely his responsibility?",nertneert,2019-02-19 13:19:28,14,412,25.67,22.59,80.75,22.02,15.85,17.96,93.45,56.31,20.63,13.83,9.95,0.24,0.49,2.91,0.24,6.8,5.83,10.92,9.47,6.07,7.28,3.4,19.42,4.85,1.7,1.7,1.46,2.43,6.07,2.91,3.16,0.49,1.7,0.49,9.22,0.24,1.21,0,3.64,15.05,2.18,2.91,2.91,1.7,2.91,3.64,1.46,0.24,0.49,0.73,3.4,0.49,2.67,0.24,0.24,8.98,1.94,1.21,2.91,2.67,0.73,4.13,15.05,1.21,16.26,2.67,5.83,8.5,1.21,0.49,0.49,0.24,0,0.24,0.73,0.49,0,0,0.24,0,19.42,5.34,6.07,0.24,0,0.73,0,0.49,0,4.61,1.94,0

ashv6p,Numbing,"So I was severely bullied at a young age, I'm talking being beaten daily by others around me, being emotionally abused by the bullies to being their friends and then they would beat me more. I fell for that trick everytime because no one else wanted to be my friend and I was so incredibly lonely.

I'm 18 now, and I'm proud to say I rarely get flashbacks and it's now more of the depression and anxiety that have stemmed from it that I need help controlling. 

But as I've gotten older, I've become alot more numb to things, like I dont feel things as much, in terms of emotions or hunger or thirst or anything like that. It usually comes and goes abit but at the moment it's been almost a full week of this. I still smile and laugh like I'm supposed to and it comes across as genuine but I dont feel anything. It might be my PTSD resurfacing or it might have something to do with my boyfriends lack of contact over the past week (He's pretty much my safety net).",Tezzlar,2019-02-19 17:00:05,0,186,13.24,11.85,92.33,7.28,23.25,13.44,93.55,62.9,22.04,12.37,10.75,0,0,0.54,1.08,9.68,3.23,14.52,13.98,4.84,11.83,1.61,21.51,5.91,5.38,0,1.08,3.23,7.53,2.69,4.3,0.54,1.61,1.08,5.38,0,2.15,0,1.08,16.67,2.69,1.08,2.15,7.53,0.54,4.84,2.15,0,1.08,1.08,1.61,0.54,0.54,0,1.08,8.06,2.15,1.61,3.76,1.08,1.08,4.3,15.05,1.61,13.98,2.15,3.76,8.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.9,3.76,3.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.84,1.08,0
asi90y,I wish some of my triggers were more easily avoidable,"A little bit of back ground: the person who gave me PTSD is my father. He beat it into me. It's pretty bad. He's been working away from home for as far as I can remember, so, on the rare occasions that he was home, he beat my sister and me. Aside from that, he's a patriarchal peace of shit who just lies down in the living room, watching football and bossing everyone, including my submissive mother who's still protecting him and blaming me when I point out how much damage he's done, around. I hated living with them, and now that I've moved out I'm doing better. Not completely fine, but the difference is worlds apart. 

Here's what's bothering me now: as I've already said, he would watch football a lot, and beat us. My brain has made that connection - seeing the football field and hearing the noise of a stadium and the sports commentator's voice (the voice is what gets me the most, for some reason), among other things, set off an alarm in my head. Since I live in Europe, it's pretty hard to avoid those things. I recently met a really sweet guy and he tried to teach me how to play, I don't know, PES or something like that because I was clicking everything on the joystick (it was turned off; I'm anxious and it was calming) and he thought I would like it. I didn't want to tell him too much, so I went with it. It was a nightmare, but I played it off as sports generally not being my thing, which isn't a lie either way. Tonight he wanted me to come over or go to a cafe with him and watch some important game, and just the thought of that freaked me out. I'm just lucky my job takes all the energy I have so I rarely go to cafes anyway, otherwise I'd be seeing and hearing those horribly triggering things all the time. 

Most of the triggers I have are more easily avoidable and understandable. This one is bothering me more than the rest, however, since I can't do anything to foresee or avoid it, and I'm getting really tired of it.

asj4fl,The man who gave me PTSD just got engaged,"I found out yesterday that he got engaged to a woman he’s been dating for less than a year. He and I were together for more than two before I finally was in such a rocky place myself from the building trauma that I had to leave him. I was absolutely numb yet simultaneously melting down from panic attacks and disassociation’s and nightmares every single day. 

I’ve been in therapy for a year next week, and it has helped so much I can’t even believe it. I don’t even recognize the woman that I was a year ago, 18 months ago. It’s absolutely incredible, and I am so grateful to have found this therapist and have these resources.

But hearing that he was engaged just rocked me to my core. So many things that I thought were settled came flying up to the surface. I know it’s kind of stupid but I ended up calling in sick to work today because I just couldn’t handle it. I couldn’t stop thinking about all the screaming, the holes in the wall, the meltdowns, having to scan him every time he walked in the room to see where he was at and what his mood was and if I needed to keep the boat from rocking. 

I was so upset yesterday, and I think all of my friends thought it was because I was upset that he had moved on. And of course that is a small part of it. But the anger and the sadness and the fear went so much deeper than that, and it took me a few hours to figure out that it’s probably my PTSD. I feel embarrassed because they all just think that I am still heartbroken and a little in love, when I’m actually just still traumatized. 

I’m so angry that he has moved on with apparently no consequences, and I am still ponderously reassembling myself day after day, week after week. It’s really hard. I just want to be well. I want to stop thinking about him, and I want to sleep through the night, and I want to not get stuck in fugue states for thirty minutes at a time.

I have been dx with PTSD but it's been in remission for a little over a year.

asjcg6,Manipulated? Trapped,"I can't stop thinking about wanting to leave my girlfriend lately but it would be such a permanent relationship ender if I mentioned a whisper of anything. I tend to feel like I'm ungrateful, just in general, and especially in regards to her. Really not sure how much of that comes from C-PTSD guilt symptoms or not? But I'll often get the impression that she twists scenarios in her favor, to make me feel bad or guilty.

We've had a long, long relationship that began in a rather strange manner. But we met in.... 2012-ish, I think? At the time, it felt like a massive stroke of luck. I'd been on the phone with one of my friends and she told me to talk to at least one person in my next class. Well, that was her. (Gonna note here that she's a trans woman, which does impact her current sex drive, among other traits.) We'd spend hours and hours together, going out to the beach or going out to eat, I enjoyed how willing she was to adventure around.

We'd share thoughts and stories for hours and hours, stay out late at night in parks to talk more. But these days it's as if she'll shut me down mid-sentence pretty often and I'm genuinely starting to hate it. She's hit me across the face once when I was in a hyper mood because I ""needed to calm down"". She doesn't know that it still bothers me. She's yelled at me to shut up during her video game playing because I'm ""distracting"". When I feel hurt about her doing those types of things, she has this tendency to turn it around on me.

It'll be about how I'm actually the one in the wrong for ""getting on her nerves"". She's made mentions about how I'm ""too loud sometimes"" or that I'm "" practically yelling when I'm excited"" but I'm doubtful that's really true. Even with my latest job, I was told by multiple people that I needed to speak up when using the store intercom. Because of my childhood abuse, I'm usually too terrified of being annoying to be as loud as she claims I am. And I'm already introverted, so I don't speak much as is.

When she's especially upset, she'll basically throw an adult tantrum. She'll start shaking, and throw things around the room; she's broken things in the past. It'll feel like no matter what action or reaction I do around her, that I'm the problem. If I withdraw or get quiet so I don't say anything stupid or lash-out, she'll get frustrated and take it out on me. But if I do show any annoyance, sadness, or anger on my face it'll be about me having a problem or how I'm hurting her feelings again.

Lately, I question if she's been taking advantage of my memory gaps. I had a white phone charger that I used all the time but she'd take any charger she could find to work in the morning, and now mine is still missing. It's so she can charge her phone at work but I explicitly recall saying I was annoyed at her for just taking mine because she'd forgotten it back there again. Except that claim has changed, she doesn't remember that talk, and tells me that I probably just lost it somewhere but can't remember. Here's the issue though, we live in a single basement bedroom, one which I choose to clean on a weekly basis. I'm an organized person who has bins and drawers and folders for where everything should go. She's the exact opposite.

My depression and hopelessness symptoms hit me like a truck these days but now I seriously question how much of it has to do with her influence. For a long time, she'd panic if I went to use the bathroom or went up to the guest bedroom for a few hours. I'm stifled in our shared room but because of her panic about my suicidal ideation, she seems to think she always has to account for where I am basically won't allow me to be alone. I've tried to explain that even if the ideation exists, me wanting alone time isn't a punishment on her or a desire for me to suddenly disappear into the night.

Honestly, she's.... way too invested in whether or not I'm even mildly unsettled and it's starting to suffocate me. I worry about losing my solo coping skills because she literally will not allow me to be alone anywhere, in the household or otherwise, if I display a flicker of moody behavior. Like, I need her to be able to believe in my recovery and trust me to not be stupid. I've been clean for months and months, maybe up to a year, from serious self-harm actions. I worry that I've hurt her in the past when I did display those sporadic episodes and I recognize that must've been frightening. But I don't try to smash my skull into walls anymore and I definitely do not binge drink or cut, nothing like that.

It feels like being around her has drastically altered me as a person. Sometimes, if I'm hurting or hopeless, she gives me the it-could-be-so-much-worse talk, or the think-about-how-lucky-you-are-to-have-me-because-so-many-other-people-are-miserable conversation. Not only does hearing either of those make me feel shitty and angry at myself but it also makes me slightly more bitter towards her because those same """"pep talks"""" are what I drill into my own head so I can stay grateful. Seriously don't need her repeating the same shit I tell myself when I'm being inwardly harsh / toxic.

That's not touching on the topic of her being forcibly sexual, or her playing enslavement porn games for hours on end and days in a row, or her not cleaning her bedroom space unless she's extremely stressed about something (which turns into kinda a fit while attempting to blindly throw everything away), or her not taking initiative to work on business projects but then will try to blame me for nothing being completed. But she's.... The only person I trust to this extent after so long? She's seen my worst parts and I've seen her's but I really wonder if I made a huge mistake by moving in with her.

askkbs,Mother with PTSD (domestic violence trigger warning),"So... i am 21 years old, female and i am currently attending college part time and working part time. I used to work and go to college full time. But have cut down due to mental stress. 

A year ago September 2017 we moved to this small town from a larger city. We moved under the circumstances of a domestic violence situation. My moms ex husband (my mother and this asshole married back in 2014 and then finally separated by force in 2016) was very abusive to my mother physically and emotionally to her only, but not me and my sisters. He tried to convince her of killing herself, possible incidences of him drugging her and always manipulated her etc... One night he got aggressive and pulled out two large knives and threatened us while locking all the doors in the house. My mom called the police and they ended up braking a window and he was arrested that night. After that he was forced to move out and we began to struggle financially (because he controlled the financial aspects of our lives. And we were dependent on him because he was in the military) he did some really fucked up shit to my mother. I despise him greatly for what he did to her. And ever since.. she hasn't been the same..

she now suffers from PTSD. This asshole continues to stalk us. Spam call us (silent calls that hang up) and he continues to fuck with our private information. We have a restraining order on him and we have renewed it recently for longer. We spend soo much time trying to report tampered information to authorities but never seem to get anywhere... this has continued to happen for 3 years and present day.. my mother has changed her number and still gets the calls constantly and so do I.

Life has been incredibly hard and scary. And very unpredictable. We have been struggling for years now. And have been forced to move back to our home town in a small 2 bedroom house my mother previously owned in a bad neighborhood. Its me, her and my 3 younger sisters. I have spend the majority of my time working in call centers and have made a long work history in jobs of that nature until i finally started college here in this small town thanks to financial aids help. So much has happened... mentally it has taken souch of a toll on us.. including my poor mother..

I absolutely love my mother. She has taught me everything i know. She has always been so patient and kind. And has always helped me in my toughest times. She was always there. My mother has always tried her absolute best. She was a young mother and had me at age 17. Things have not been perfect but she has always been strong. And so have we.

However.. after what happened with my moms ex husband.. things have not been the same.. my once caring and loving mother has become bitter and aggressive.. she is sick with a joint condition that seems to get worse with stress... i am concerned about her.. she has taken out her anger on me especially. She has become resentful of me and my sisters and has constantly reminded me and my second oldest sister (age 18 and autistic) that we are a burden in her house.. she has called us lazy and ungrateful.. she says we are ""killing"" her (she claims this to be sarcasm but this remark is always followed by agression) and that we are pushing her over the edge.. me and my second oldest sister work and attend school . My second oldest sister attends high school and i attend college and we both work. I pay some of the bills and so does she. The house is horrible crowded with stuff we were forced to move last minute from our big house in the larger city (we have been here a year so far). And we are always busy most of the day. My mother especially. She has thrown chairs and raged frightening my younger sisters twice and blames it on me.. she has even told my autistic sisters ""why can't you just be normal"" when she gets upset at her.

She is currently unemployed and is receiving government benefits to maintain the rest of the expenses. And because of the fear she has over her ex husband she often obsesses about him being near the house (especially since his family live in the same street as us. Thinking he will use that as an excuse to lurk around.. and there has been suspicion activity around out house before.  People stealing things tampering with our fences, the locks being picked at night etc-)

Before she started to get aggresive and when she was on the verge of losing her job due to physical condition i have offered to drop out of college to get a full time job to help with more of the bills. But she insisted i stay in college. She assured me we will be fine. So I trusted her, and i stayed enrolled. 

The harder things get. The more aggressive my mother got.. she has grown distant and bitter.. her love seems so conditional at this point.. and I am so heartbroken..now she threatens to kick me out at any moment over forgetting to clean something around the house or waking up late. Or generally when i dont do what she wants me to do. Her scolding has gotten more hurtful.. i am always called ""disrespectful"", ""ungrateful "", ""manipulative"", ""abusive"", ""childish"", ""spoild"", ""over emotional"" etc... I am always reminded of my mistakes when i dont do what she asks and even if i say nothing at all i am ""disrespecting"" her and ""i dont know how i make her feel"" when i do that... 

I... am exhausted.. i understand my mother has a mental illness due to a team event... I am trying soooo hard to be patient and to handle it in the best way i can but at the cost of my self esteem? I am not the enemy.. but she makes me feel like i am.. she accuses me of being all the things that that her abusive were to her.. to her i am a liar... to her i am a manipulator... to her i am two-faces.. to her i am intentionally bringing her down.. to her i make her ""eat shit"" as she puts it... 

The things i do wrong is that i am not consistent with cleaning nor is she because of our busy days.. i clean when i can but i am often tired and so is she. The house and it being small often gets dirty and cleaning is often neglected. I try my best to keep up with it but its a lot... She omits my second oldest sister from doing it and my 12 year old sister (because they are younger and my 18 year old sister often throws tantrums due to her autism) so its only me and her keeping up with the house. I sleep in late and that bothers her a great deal because i am not being productive enough... and i shut in my room for the majority of the time.. we have argued often about the things she says but i am always wring and shut out..

I am often depressed.. i face my own personal issues with my father being deported due to him being arrested and me declining sponsorship due to fear of being taken advantage and for being financially unreliable even to myself... and suffer from my own chronic medical conditions (HS).. i already have low self esteem and i already feel like shit... why is it that my own mother.. someone who i love deeply and who has always built me up.. is now tearing me down? 

Now.. i am being kicked out. Because i have refused to allow her to call me names and to devalue me.. i have tried working it out. I have suggested family counseling and she has declined it.. I have even spoken with her counselor to have a family council..but she never goes through with it.. she only suggests it when she feels that i am doing her wrong ""maybe we need family counseling so my counselor can see how much you treat me like shit"".... she paints this rotten picture of me to everyone.. to her i am all the things she hates.. she has stopped giving me rides to college and has threatened to throw my cat outside and has kicked my door in and slapped me because i have chosen to ignore her..... 

So I have made effort to move out with my boyfriend and his parents. I told her that I was going to leave by the end of the semester and she said ""that isn't soon enough "" ... so now i am looking into dropping out.. 

Reddit... i am writing this today because i am terribly hurt and i do know if i am making the right decision.. a part of me is convinced that I am the things she tells me that i am lazy and ungrateful and a immature adult.. but another part lf me is saying that it is not right for someone to make me feel so bad that I despise myself... I feel hopeless because i do not know how to get her the help she needs and because i am still dependent on her especially if i want to continue my education..

It has gotten to the point where i contemplate suicide. Because her opinion is something i hold highly. And i am pained because this small family i was left with is the only structure i have. And it feels frail and seems to be breaking apart.. we are all miserable.. and her tender sides only show to my youngest siblings.. and i want nother but her affection again..

I do not know what to do and i feel i have no choice but to leave college and move out.. 

Has anyone ever been in this situation? Is there something i may be doing wrong? Am i really what she says i am? Could i have really be manipulative and abusive ?? If this sounds familiar to anyone please speak out..

Thank you for your time.",theunsurelad,2019-02-19 21:40:30,0,1751,21.17,63.85,56.54,1,12.97,14.96,93.83,61.11,22.22,17.59,9.19,1.83,0.23,6.23,0.11,4.63,3.88,11.88,10.28,5.37,8.91,1.14,17.93,4.85,2,1.2,1.14,1.37,6.28,1.37,4.8,0.91,2,0.63,14.56,2.34,0.11,6.91,1.31,10.28,1.66,2.51,0.63,2.17,1.83,2.28,1.94,0.23,0.63,0.86,1.71,0.51,0.86,0.17,0.06,9.82,3.66,1.31,3.6,1.37,0.8,4.11,13.42,0.4,15.71,1.83,6.62,7.48,2.51,0.4,1.37,0.69,0,0.17,0.8,0.46,0.11,0.06,0,0,16.96,12.85,0.69,0,0,0.4,0,0.11,1.6,0.17,1.14,0

asmbad,PTSD since 1976,"Hi, all 
I'm new here. I've been suffering from PTSD since 1976. Some days are good, but most really suck. Without going into detail I'll just say my PTSD is combat related, although we were not in a ""declared"" war at the time. Not Vietnam, BTW. It took the VA and social security until 2014 to finally recognize my problems.
I suffer nightmares almost every night and only get about 4 hours of sleep. 
Writing fiction has become a release for me. 
My current wife, my first wife passed away, is supportive, but doesn't really understand why I have so many bad days. She doesn't understand why we sit in the back of a restaurant and I always have to face the door. 
She doesn't like when I drink but she knows it keeps the monsters (memories) at bay - flashbacks are less frequent when I've had a few adult beverages. 
She also doesn't understand the mood swings and the anger that sometimes wells up. I try to warn her that this is not a good time for a discussion and it pisses her off. There are no support systems for families where I live - the Philippines  - so she just puts puts up with my bs.  
Damn, I'm rambling now. 
Anyway, I look forward to reading posts here about how people cope with their monsters. 
Sorry for the rambling, but it's been one of the bad days. 
BTW, I never physically abuse my wife but I can get loud sometimes and I know that can be just as bad. She loves me and puts up with my shit. 
I sold all my weapons but there are days when I wish I hadn't. 
Oh, and I was in counseling for a year. Useless. I take no drugs,  like xanax or any of that shit but beer, brandy,  and gin are great pacifiers.",KrazyKano,2019-02-20 01:21:34,15,313,25.08,11.86,91.07,1,13.04,13.74,90.73,56.55,15.97,13.1,9.58,0.64,0,2.56,0.32,2.88,5.43,11.5,9.9,8.95,8.63,3.83,18.53,2.88,1.28,2.24,1.92,2.88,8.95,2.56,6.07,0,2.88,1.28,7.67,1.28,0,3.51,0,13.74,2.88,1.6,0.64,2.56,1.6,4.79,0.96,0.32,0.64,0,4.15,1.6,1.28,0,0.96,9.27,2.88,0.64,1.6,2.24,1.92,2.88,15.34,0.96,15.02,2.24,5.11,8.63,0.64,1.28,0.64,0.32,0,0.32,3.19,1.92,0.96,0,0.32,0.32,18.21,7.35,4.79,0,0,0,0,0.96,0.64,3.83,0.64,0
asn1rl,Paranoia taking an unexpected turn,"I’ve recently come out about abuse I suffered in childhood and expected it to hit me hard again, and it did, in a very unexpected way. 

It’s late and I’m tired but basically found out that the man involved had other victims, and hunted one girl down IRL (this all happened online). 

Of course right after i got this info a slew of other things happened. I had my life threatened by a customer at work. Trafficking is high in my area and I’ve had sketchy groups coming into my store and asking if I’m alone, loitering around the building, etc. I was in the immediate vicinity of a shooting (no one was injured). 

I’m totally convinced that 1.) someone is after me, or 2.) I’m going to be killed or hurt in some sort of malicious act. I can’t hardly leave my house and I absolutely will not leave after dark. I can’t go anywhere alone. I can’t be home alone after dark without my roommate home without locking myself in the bathroom and not coming out until she gets back. I’ve nailed blankets over my window in case someone could possibly peek through the gap in my curtains. I can’t undress in my own bedroom. I’m 20 fucking years old and drafting a will because I’m certain that someone is going to kill me. 

 I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like everyone is watching me, and not watching me at the same time. Like, there’s constantly eyes on me but if someone were to try and grab me, no one would be paying enough attention to stop them. Shit, I have to check my fucking trunk before getting in my car because i’m terrified that someone will be hiding in my car. I can’t sleep at all, and don’t even get me started on the nightmares. It’s ducking exhausting. I feel like i’ve 100% gone crazy. 

I don’t know what provoked this particular reaction out of all of the ways i could have reacted. I haven’t been to therapy in 2 weeks and I’m going back thursday so i’ll have a chance to talk about all of that, but her office is in a semi-sketch area and I’m afraid to drive there.

asoyph,Feels like I am incapable of having fun,"TW: Childhood abuse, sexual assault. TL;DR: It feels like my trauma has lead to me feeling like I always have to be responsible, and can never actually relax and have fun.

Growing up, I was held to an unreasonably high standard by a mentally ill grandmother, who was hell-bent on breaking me of anything childish by age 11. She did this by destroying any of the books or toys she thought I loved too much, and by yelling at me if I acted like a child around her. 

She was around less during my teen years, but after that I got involved in a string of abusive or just toxic relationships. In my second year of university, I was randomly assaulted while walking around my city downtown. A year later I got involved in another toxic relationship which ended in assault.

I'm 23 now, and in a better situation than I ever was. Understandably, I don't have many memories of just being able to cut loose and have fun. It's gotten to the point where I'm not even sure I remember what it feels like to have genuine relaxed fun with others for more than 2 or 3 hours tops.

I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be a fucking downer for the rest of my life. But it's almost like I don't know how to relax and just have fun. I feel as though I wind up always having to be the responsible one, the designated driver, etc. even though I hate it. But at this point I don't even know how to change. 

I've been called a ""stick in the mud"" and a ""bummer"" by people close to me, and I'm inclined to believe them. But at the same time I don't know where to even begin. 

Thank you for reading. I just needed to get my feelings out somewhere. I worry that at this point it's impossible for me to start having a good time.",Squidiculus,2019-02-20 06:31:49,0,342,48.87,10.45,96.47,25.77,15.55,12.87,92.69,60.82,17.84,12.28,10.53,0,0.29,1.17,0.29,5.26,4.97,18.13,10.82,7.02,6.43,2.34,19.3,5.56,4.68,2.05,1.75,1.75,7.6,3.8,3.8,0.29,2.92,0,4.97,0.29,0,1.46,0,14.04,4.39,1.17,1.46,2.63,1.46,4.39,2.34,0,0.29,2.05,2.34,0,1.46,0.58,0,6.73,0.88,1.17,3.8,1.75,0,4.39,12.57,0,15.2,1.17,8.19,5.85,1.46,2.92,0,0,0.29,0,0.58,0.58,0,0,0,0,15.79,6.14,3.51,0.58,0.29,0,0,0.29,1.17,3.8,0,0
asqd32,Please tell me I'm not the only one who gets this (Sexual Assault TW),"Things in the trauma department have actually been okay for me. Overall, things have been good. I haven't been as depressed.

But now I can't get these God-awful intrusive thoughts out of my head. Imagining what would happen if I was raped again. How I would handle (or, rather, not handle) it. Imagining how the scenario would go.

asqkz7,Struggling with upcoming court date (possible triggers),"I was granted an emergency PFA and custody of my kids mid January. We had a hearing a week later and my ex asked for a continuation to get an attorney. The judge asked him why we were here and he basically said we were just having a rocky relationship. That really bothered me as I felt like he was downplaying all of the abuse. 

March 5th is the next court date. I’m to try to bring witnesses and be prepared to testify. My therapist is going to help me write a trauma narrative. I’m having a really hard time coping the past week. I have no idea how to handle court and facing him. If anyone has any advice or even coping strategies to get me through that day I would appreciate it.

asqn4n,I'm not sure but i think i might have ptsd (TW: blood),"I have recently decided to see a psychologist but i am not sure.

When i was 8, my mom was robbed at knifepoint by a couple of druggies on a motorcycle right before my eyes. She took 2 knife wounds. I was unharmed but my mind somehow blocked out all memory of ever seeing a knife.

What i do remember is us running to a nearby establishment to ask for help. Blood fell in thick dark drops - i can still see them in my mind. And as the drops fell, a waiter at the establishment mopped them up silently, and the drops turned to streaks of dark red on the tiled flooring. This is probably what i see in my minds eye the most.

Whenever i hear the sound of a specific type of motorcycle engine running, my mind goes blank. My first instinct is to run and run and run and my heart beats like crazy. 

And sometimes, i think about that memory and i can't stop crying. I don't even know why - my mom is alive and well, and i wasn't even harmed. I am typing this while sobbing.

asv90j,Do I need to go NC to heal from abuse by my family related to my sexual trauma?,"This is a ridiculously long story with no tl;dr but I really need some advice. I'm going to start around 2005. I was a high school junior with over a 4.0 gpa on track to go to my college of choice on full scholarships and then law school, and I also worked 30 to 40 hours per week as a waitress so I was paying most of my own expenses (but not rent). I eventually did all those things i planned and am now a moderately successful attorney. I was laser focused on my future when I was young so I was generally a ""set it and ""forget it"" kinda self sufficient young person at this point. I was the first person in my family to graduate from college, was valedictorian, and got my law degree with highest honors.

The kindest way I can put the next part is to say that my family had a lot of problems. My sisters and I, one of whom is close to me in age and lived with me growing up, took care of each other a lot when our parents were failing to meet their responsibilities. There was also a lot of abuse in lots of directions. Mom and Dad verbally abused the shit out of each other ruthlessly every day for years and years with my dad punching walls and cornering my mom sometimes. Our daily lives were a battlefield with them using us as pawns against each other. They allowed us children to be exposed to their behavior toward each other and it scared and confused us so much that I think it has a lifelong influence on our feeling of general security. Mom and Dad also physically and verbally abused us seriously. Dad threw my oldest sister at the wall when she was about 15 because she started dating a black guy (we lived in an area where our school was mainly black and we were white) and then he tore down all of her posters that had any black men in them, including will Smith. I consider our childhood household to be quite abusive, and I have worked quite a bit in the area of domestic violence law so I mean that objectively speaking. Based on my professional experience as a GAL I dont believe our household would have survived any amount of scrutiny by a court or an agency like DCFS. There is a lot more to this but I dont wanna lose ya here by being too long winded. 

My parents got divorced in 2000. Mom and Dad sat us down and said they were doing it for financial reasons (apparently mom had run up $40K in credit card debt and was addicted to large amounts of ephedra which was still legal then) but that we were going to stay together and they would still be a couple and nothing was going to change. Soon dad started disappearing for long periods, like going to the grocery store and then coming back with no groceries 9 hours later, or going on vacation with his new gf during Christmas to visit my grandparents, who hated my mom and thus were fine with my dad having a new gf, but not telling us he took his new gf on that trip until we found out accidentally. 

In the divorce, my dad hired an attorney, who practices now in my courtroom and does not have a good reputation in the legal community today. Back in 2000, she advised my Dad that there was no need for both of the spouses to spend money on an attorney--she could just do it for $1000 and it would be unnecessary for my mom to seek her own representation. In fact, she didnt even need to show up to court, said counsel. Sadly, I now know that this was highly unethical and that my dad getting full custody because of my mom's lack of awareness of her rights and her trust in his word even when they were divorcing was probably not the right outcome. By that I mean that if a GAL had been brought in to represent the interests of the children, Dad would not have gotten full custody and might have had to have his visitation supervised. Instead, mom felt defeated before it even began and she basically just let it all happen. 

In 2004 mom moved out after dad changed the locks while she was at work one day. She came home on a lunch break to take a shit and he wouldn't even let her in to use the toilet. It was ugly to say the least, but my sister had just gotten her license and at least she could drive us to visit our mom. Mom was never well again from that point forward. She descended into alcoholism and died at a young age from a preventable disease. Visitation was difficult but I'm still glad I spent time with her when she was still alive. 

Now, back to 2005, I was a teenager and I had planned visitation with mom on a weekend day. Mom didnt have a license anymore but she and my aunt came over to pick me up. The conflict started because my room was messy (honestly it always was, and my house is messy now, and idgaf) so my dad said I couldnt go to mom's. I tried to get into my aunt's Pontiac aztech but he grabbed me by the feet and tried to drag me out of the car onto the pavement. My mom was pulling on my top half but my dad was stronger and a struggle ensued but my dad pulled me out and dragged me on the driveway. For reference, I was 5 foot 4 and 130 lbs, and he was 5 foot 10 and about 250 lbs. There was a huge screaming match that ended in my mom and aunt leaving. I dont remember exactly why they left. 

The battle between my dad and me continued into the house, and we screamed at each other at the top of our lungs. We said the most hateful things we could conjure up. This wasnt our first go around with each other. I was standing on the top step of a set of 12 carpeted stairs and he was in the living room below as we argued. Whatever I was saying (I dont recall exactly what) made my dad so enraged that he quickly charged up the stairs toward me and clotheslined or body checked me by hitting me directly in the face with his massive shoulder. I fell to the ground and he stood over me screaming ""you wanna see who can scream louder than who?"" over and over while advancing forward as I was cowering and crawling backward on the floor of the bathroom at the top of the stairs, a distance of about 20 feet. When he had cornered me and kept coming at me and screaming, I told him to back off and that just made him more angry so I grabbed my virgin mobile flip phone and called 911. During this incident, my sister was in clear view and able to see and hear the whole thing from her bedroom near the bathroom with the door open. 

My dad was and is a volunteer firefighter so he knew a lot of the sheriff's deputies and city police officers. As soon as I called 911, he snapped immediately into a different calm personality preparing to talk to the police and save face with the emergency personnel. My sister claims that at this time he gave her his debit card and told her she may have to bail him out of jail but he now denies recollection of that. He went out into the driveway so that he could talk to the police before I did, ya know, to tell them that we just have an out of control teen here who needs to be put in her place. They took both of our statements and then asked my sister what happened. she lied and said she was in a different part of the house and had no idea what happened. 

For some reason, even though she and I grew up side by side, we have very different views of the world and the difference between right and wrong. In the end, no arrest was made but we were required to go to the police station to meet with social workers. My dad was required to do counseling and to pay for me to attend counseling and a social worker monitored our family for the next year. My dad's side of the family was not shy about shaming me for calling the cops on my dad. They did not however criticize him at all for committing domestic battery against me or for scaring me so badly that I felt I needed help from the police. 

Years passed, my mom died rather suddenly and tragically at 55 right after I passed the bar exam. I needed medication to deal with my devastation after losing my mom, and that caused my sex drive to stop completely. My former long term boyfriend sexually assaulted me multiple times after years of physical and emotional abuse. (I am aware that my abusive father may have caused me to seek out abusive characteristics in a partner). I was diagnosed with PTSD, and I already had GAD and depression. I went through a really rough time period there where I dissociated chronically. During that time period (2015), I met with my sister, with whom I shared a close relationship by then, for dinner at a local bar. Somehow the topic of the incident between my dad and me where the police were called came up between us, and she became indignant. She was angry that she was put in the middle, and she blamed me for that. 

Then, she proceeded to tell me basically that I'm not a good person and I never have been and how it is always been unpleasant for my family to have to be around me. She then told me that the incident with my dad was my fault because I just enjoy being the victim, and it was my fault I got raped and had ptsd because I just love being the victim. I literally pleaded with her to stop because it will make dad unhappy if we dont get along, but she said she was done with my shit. She and her boyfriend then stormed out, leaving me sobbing alone right as the food arrived. (They did smugly pay the bill before leaving). 

I told my dad what happened and he was puzzled that the incident even came up. He took no stance on what was right or wrong in that situation in 2005. I told him I know I was being disrespectful and being a teenager but I just want him to take responsibility too. His response was that he took responsibility by paying for all of our counseling that got required because of it. He wouldn't budge. I thought that maybe if he had grown enough to acknowledge that what he did wasnt right in hindsight, and if he were to explain that to my sister, maybe she would let up on me. No go. The true irony here is that my dad's current wife is a domestic violence prosecutor who has a 16 year old daughter with a different dad, and you better believe someone would be getting charged with a crime if they body checked that little girl, no matter what she said. Wife also frequently complains about the family dynamics that make it difficult for victims to report crimes committed against them by household or family members.

Not long after the fight with my sister happened, my dad told me my sister's bf asked for permission to ask my sister to marry him on their upcoming vacation. I didnt want to let a temporary disagreement stand in the way of my longterm relationship with my sister, so even though she never apologized for blaming me for my rape, I texted her that I love her and I hope she has a good trip. 

Our relationship has gradually improved since then. She did invite me to her wedding and I went and was nothing but nice and supportive. However, my sister and her then fiance are very simple self described country folks, and they had their wedding in their backyard so I just assumed they weren't doing a whole formal thing with bridesmaids and groomsmen. My dad had previously mentioned that my sister had her bridal shower, and I was sad she didnt invite me but I said nothing. 

Much to my surprise, I show up on the day of the wedding, already crying because I wish my mom were there, and see that 3 girls my sister has talked mad shit about in the not so distant past are dressed as her bridesmaids and conducting a bunch of little pre wedding rituals in which I was not welcome to participate. It killed me inside. My big sister and I had talked about our weddings since we were kids just assuming we would be each other's maid of honor, but instead she chose this girl who she previously said didnt really care about anything other than having a good time (getting drunk). In her maid of honor's speech, she said that she was part of our family now. Like, no the fuck you aren't bitch. This whole day absolutely made me feel like my insides were crumpling up, shrinking, and dying. I contemplated getting in my car and leaving without saying anything to anyone, but I had promised my grandma in another state I would record the ceremony for her and I didnt want to make the day about me so I just did my best to put on a happy face. After the wedding, I kept quiet about my feelings because I truly dont trust my family enough to tell them the way I feel. Part of me doesnt want my sister to know how much it hurt me because I think she would be happy she hurt me and I dont want to give her the satisfaction. 

The wedding was in October of 2018 and things have been pretty calm since then except that I've been having chronic nightmares about my dad and sister ganging up on me and telling me all the reasons I'm worthless and not a good person. These are intense ptsd nightmares that come in between flashbacks of my assaults or recreations of them. I wake up sick, panicking, and frequently vomiting. I have talked to my psychiatrist about this and adjusted meds as best as possible. I have told my dad about the dreams and he seems puzzled and cant understand how those could be based in any real memories. He has a very selective memory that conveniently excludes his own wrongdoing.

Here's the meat of the issue, finally: my dad generally treats my sister like she hangs the moon. She can do no wrong in his eyes. I think he loves her more because she's humble and only a high school grad like him and I'm all uppity and educated. He also acts like getting married is literally the best thing you could ever do. He was so much happier at her wedding than he was when I graduated law school summa cum laude, got a full scholarship to both college and law school, or landed one of the most prestigious jobs in my regional market. I feel his failure to denounce her bad behavior, his failure to tell my sister not to treat me like that because it's not right, constitutes an endorsement of her actions and words, but I dont trust either of them enough to tell them that. Every time I see or hear about him treating her like a saint, I feel like he's telling me that what she said is right. 

This last Friday night was her birthday dinner, and of course maid of honor was in attendance and well lubricated as usual. I put on my happy face and was nice to everyone, but pretty much every time I opened my mouth someone interrupted me or talked over me. It didnt help that I was the only adult at the table not drinking alcohol. My dad and my sister decided this would be an appropriate time to reminisce about what fun they had at her wedding shower (from which I was excluded) right in front of me. She said to my dad in some joke I didnt understand, ""yeah well you weren't technically allowed at my shower,"" and I thought ""yeah neither was I"" but i did not say a word, did not stop smiling, hugged everyone and left while some were still finishing dessert saying that i didnt feel so hot. 

After holding in my emotions all this time, something snapped in my head, something akin to a ptsd episode. It was like I was broken all weekend, mich worse than usual. Uncontrollable panic attacks, sobbing, and nightmares with obsessive thoughts about how my sister said my rape was my fault and my dad's complicity with all of her actions means that he thinks it was my fault too. I decided right away that I was going to need to have some space from both of them for awhile because their influence seems to be preventing me from recovering from my assaults. On Monday, I sent my dad a long text that was calmly and carefully worded but direct and assertive. I told him I need some space from them and I deserve an apology from each of them, and I requested that he not reply to the message because a back and forth exchange may traumatize me further. He did not reply.

The real problem with this whole situation is that my dad and my sister are usually my 2 closest family members. I have to admit that I've been thinking a lot about ending my life now that I dont care if it hurts them. I dont have much else left in the way of family and I don't put much stock in the idea of friends. I dont trust them. They come and go. So now it's just kind of me and my dog. 

Did I do the right thing? Am I helping my recovery or hurting myself overall by taking some space from them? I have been to a lot of therapy but none lately and I really need to hear what an outsider sees in this situation. Please give me your perspective. If you have read this whole thing thank you so much.",avocat_89,2019-02-20 15:08:21,5,3169,39.41,57.15,67.16,8.95,23.47,15.21,93.22,59.1,20.1,15.43,8.96,1.17,0.32,3.94,1.04,4.67,5.11,13.92,8.39,5.05,8.02,2.18,16.5,3.94,2.24,1.2,1.07,2.43,5.55,2.05,3.44,0.28,1.23,0.63,15.27,3.79,0.32,4.26,3.09,11.08,1.89,1.55,1.55,2.43,1.14,3.6,2.08,0.5,1.01,0.54,2.05,0.63,0.66,0.28,0.44,9.28,3.79,1.2,3.22,1.04,0.98,7.76,6.75,1.14,14.7,2.27,7.42,5.36,2.11,0.88,1.23,0.6,0.09,0.16,0.69,0.22,0.22,0.09,0.09,0,9.09,4.13,2.84,0.03,0.03,0.13,0,0.06,0.28,0.88,0.63,0.06

Has anyone blocked their trauma out so much they can’t remember?,"They seem to change - whether it be gunshots or fireworks, how I have to see and map out each exit at any event I go to, how a man walking just a *little* to close can make me whip around and be ready to fight.

asxcjg,Campers &amp; Coercion,"I had to write this again bc I couldn’t crosspost it for some reason. Sorry it’s long but venting is helping. My backstory-I’m very soft spoken, gentle &amp; introverted person by nature but became a loner from having a disability, school bullying and a mentally abusive stepdad. I survived most days by escaping to own imagination, living vicariously through books and having the affection of pets. When my “trauma” occurred, I was in my mid 20s, already in a dark state of mind, contemplating suicide and having thoughts of murder. I didn’t know how else my family and I could be free. Anyway, I decided one day that instead of one of us dying, I still just wanted to be loved and a Prince Charming needed to save me. And right away. So I turned to online dating. I wish I could take that one decision back. A man from out of state (but only a few hours away) contacted and pursued me. I still don’t remember any red flags or anything odd that stood out about him. He told me he graduated from the college near me and had friends here still &amp; sometimes had to come back &amp; forth for work; entirely plausible bc I know several other people that do the same thing. We exchanged texts, a few weeks of friendly banter &amp; flirtation. It eventually got a lot more intense; I had someone to talk to, to trust. Many people knew what my stepdad was like, what my family was going through, including other family &amp; church. And they all looked the other way like it didn’t matter. This guy paid attention to me and took me seriously. I can’t drive bc of my disability and he would eventually drive several hours just to see me. So I fell hard. I had had a “normal” boyfriend before but this was intense lust, passion. Nothing like I’d ever felt. But one weekend when he asked me to stay with him, the first “incident” occurred. He picked me up, we drove a few hours. He said he was tired and wanted to stop at a hotel, even though we should have been almost at his house. It was weird &amp; I knew something was wrong. He wasn’t too tired bc we had sex in the hotel all night. But when I woke up, he was on the couch staring like in a trance. And clutching a backpack. I don’t think he was stoned, it looked like he was having a hallucination. When I touched him he snapped out of it and yelled at me &amp; grabbed me. I got startled, went to the bathroom. Then I heard the door slam and my heart drop. He’d left me there. Abandoned me in a hotel like a prostitute. I wasn’t mad. I felt overwhelming fear, abandonment, rejection. I called someone to get me and felt intense fear until they arrived. I still deal with this. Even if I go out to eat with someone &amp; they step away to the bathroom, I feel overwhelmed, afraid they won’t come back. I let this jerk in again after a bs story and apology. I tried blowing him off at first but I was weak. My stepdad had just beat my little brother so bad that social services was investigating, I hated my mom for not leaving, I had no self esteem, no direction. I thought I needed him. So the next time he promised me he wanted to make it up to me, let me come live with him. I decided to just stay a week to make sure I liked it bc I was anxious from the hotel incident. But again...this time instead of stopping at a hotel he stopped at a bank. Put on sunglasses &amp; grabbed the backpack. Idk if it had drugs, a gun, idk? Idk why he targeted me to begin with bc he didn’t initially know that I had a disability or home problems. Anyway he told me to go inside and empty my account from my debit. He went in with me. My parents had used my money for a bill so it was empty and I think that saved my life. He took me back to the car and thought for a few minutes then took me to a campground. It was still cold outside, I only saw one car there. The camper was rusted and rundown. The inside was trashed and looked like an episode of hoarders. I’m not sure if he’d planned to bring me here in the first place. Or if he’s taken other girls there. There was a small tub filled with acorns bc it was squirrel infested. I still have nightmares from the sounds of squirrels and mice running through the walls while the bugs and ants crawled on my skin in the dirty bedsheets. I love animals &amp; the outdoors. But it’s still hard to do things like hiking, especially seeing a squirrel pop out and I can’t tell someone why I’m freaked. He had sex with me in the camper in the late evening. I’m not calling it rape bc I didn’t try to fight him off. That’s part of my guilt and inability to tell my story, why I don’t feel like a real victim. But I was scared to death, my fight or flight ego mode on I guess. I had no idea why he’d brought me to this place, what he was going to do with me, how to deal, etc. survival mode maybe? Or maybe that’s my excuse. Bc I still enjoyed the sexy part. I disassociated myself during that time while he was there with me; sex was darkly twisted for me, I still thought it meant love and he was my prince. During the day and night though I was alone in there. No food or water. I was so hungry I tried to eat a can of soup out of one of the many trash bags but it was several years old and I puked. I still can’t eat soup. I had access to a cell &amp; told my mom I was ok and having a nice time. I didn’t want my stepdad to know how stupid I was, to need their help. I was also still suicidal and at the same time fearing for my life. I wanted mom to think I was happy if something did happen to me. Thankfully my survival instincts truly kicked in after almost a week and I told her the truth. I didn’t know where I was but she found me thanks to cell maps/technology. She got me while he was gone during the day. I came home &amp; my stepdad hugged me sincerely for the first time in a decade. He died soon after. And I died inside. Staring at the wall. Mom pushing me to brush my teeth, shower. I did eventually wake up from the “death” that I felt. But then I felt the pain. And got addicted to porn, one night stands,etc. I couldn’t handle real relationships. I turned to dom/sub type relationships because I felt so ostracized from society, no longer like a human, but I made a good pet for cruel masters. I’ve been going to church for a while now &amp; im finally past dealing or not dealing with things those ways. But I still feel crippled by fear, abandonment, shame. Not just by what happened but how I’ve wrecked my life afterwards dealing with it. I’m done with how I did deal with things but I can’t find the courage to actually stand up on my own two legs and conquer what feels like the Great Wall of China. Mines not a story of overcoming...yet anyway. But I hope other people learn lessons from it anyway. I won’t tell young women to know their self worth and yada yada yada bc I cant seem to get that through my thick skull yet. How about a lesson to others not to drive people to the point of weakness through cruelty and bullying that they feel it’s too late? That’s one theme I’d like to drive home. Your actions can have life threatening consequences on someone else. And you never know what secrets and hurts and pain someone else is carrying. And if you know of things going on that shouldn’t be, don’t look the other way bc you feel you can’t make a difference. Just being an ear can do something.",sheltieluvr8,2019-02-20 18:15:17,0,1434,33.49,18.04,91.09,10.08,13.4,13.25,91.84,59.55,20.22,15.27,11.23,0.35,0.35,2.86,0.49,4.95,5.58,12.97,8.23,6.42,7.81,2.79,17.99,3.21,1.53,1.46,0.91,1.32,5.51,2.09,3.35,0.91,0.91,0.84,9.07,0.98,0.28,0.63,3.42,13.67,3.28,2.09,1.74,2.51,0.84,4.74,3,0.77,0.42,1.74,2.93,0.49,1.05,0.63,0.56,5.58,1.74,1.19,1.26,0.98,0.7,9.21,6.76,1.05,14.44,2.86,5.51,6.49,0.91,1.05,0.98,0.7,0.14,0.56,1.46,0.14,1.05,0.07,0,0.49,16.95,7.6,3.21,0,1.19,0.21,0,0.07,0.56,2.86,0.14,1.12

A few years back, my father was diagnosed with a rare 1 / 10 million chance of cancer on the muscle and ventricle sac (a nebulous bubble, like that which surrounds a child in the womb) with stage 4 heart cancer, right after he received a successful triple heart bypass surgery.  Doctors said that if they had never done the bypass, that type of cancer was basically undetectable and he would have passed without any warning.

&amp;#x200B;

As for me, I was so scared of the triple bypass that the fact that he had cancer didn't quite register at first, until the doctor sat us down and really told us what was what.  After all, many of my relatives had had cancer, and they ended up OK.  Once they said it was in late stage ""6-months to live"" territory, and no possible surgery for heart transplants was viable, that's when I buried my head in the sand and just pretended it didn't happen.  I squandered my time ignoring the problem, never visiting my family and pretending life was normal.  Denial was my drug of choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 11 days after my 30th birthday, and I had made it just in time to the hospital (after lying on my couch in the basement trying to convince myself that my father would be fine that day, I didn't need to go visit), I got an urgent call from my younger brother... I needed to be there, right now.  I made it just in time to the hospital to hold my father's hand while he passed away.  

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, anytime I see a movie or watch a show where someone passes away and someone else holds their hand or is comforting then when they pass, I break down near uncontrollably, flashing back with near perfect memory to that moment.  The look on my mom's face, the shriek in her voice, seeing the shine disappear in my dad's eyes, and the coldness in his fingers even before he passed.  It paralyzes me in a way that nothing else really does, and turns me into a giant ball of snot, fear, regret and a boat-load of anger at myself for not doing anything earlier, which only tends to feed back into itself like the monster that it is.

at0rew,D&amp;D character with PTSD questions (sorry if this type of post is not allowed),"So I myself am suffering from a PTSD from being bullied in my childhood and other things that I might discuss later.

I mostly put my time and energy in writing and love D&amp;D and role playing my characters. I try to make them all unique and memorable and always strive to make them feel real as possible.

Now I had this interesting character who is suffering from PTSD as she has quite the typical scarring main character background, but instead of being cheery and only being there to make the character feel interesting I thought it would be something to make the background have some impact on her.

She is based off of Guts, the main character from berserk, where she has a lot of trust issues, lack of parent figures, trouble with physical contact and the only outlet and place she feels in control is in battle. I’ve discussed some of the triggers she has with my girlfriend who does a lot of research into this kinda stuff and she says that my character seems to be pretty consistent with her traumas and her unhealthy way of dealing with them.

The question I have is though, is how it would manifest over the years, as I had the idea that the character at the time of playing would be around 50 years old. She had no real healthy coping mechanism or any good outlet, hasn’t been very open towards others except her wife who she spent time with but she had died in a horrible fashion so that made her close up again. 

Would triggers, certain traumas and such that you had gained since childhood still remain really bad at your 50th without any good coping mechanism or outlet? She also has gone through some pretty scarring events between her childhood and the age she is now.

Again, very sorry if these kind of questions are inappropriate on a sub like this. It didn’t seem a good question to ask on a D&amp;D related sub since this really is about making a character with PTSD feel accurate or at least consistent. 

I would really appreciate any feedback and please be nice.

at2cov,I’m stuck in a school-related PTSD loop.. and it’s preventing me from progressing in life.,"I wouldn’t say the pstd is 100% school itself, but it’s the cherry on top of all the trauma I was going through at 14 years old. It made everything worse.

I left public school at the end of 9th grade due to my mental health deteriorating and my grades getting worse. So I got homeschooled for a few years.


Fast forward to now..

I’m 21. Not working a 9-5(I do some side jobs like housesitting, taking care of animals, yard work. But only a few times each year) and I I’m not taking and classes or courses.. on top of the fact I don’t have a diploma or GED.


Now this is where the issue comes in. I was a terrible student. Both learning and behavior wise. I was depressed and was a class clown. I had ADHD  and I just didn’t take it seriously. And because of that, I was a terrible test taker. I’d get anxiety attacks nights before a big test and end up staying home those days..

Now you might see where I’m headed with this. The GED test is 4 categories and multiple hours of testing..

So starting a few years ago I started looking at pretests and jobs(hoping I could make it in life without ged/diploma) and instantly I had a mental breakdown. I lost my shit. The worst I’ve ever felt in my life. I was having an episode for a whole week.. just from looking at the ged - nothing else. 

Just simply looking at anything related to school/education fucks me up.. and every time I try to get my life started, I end up repeating the episodes.

Every. Single. Time.


And on top of it, my parent(who I live with) is always telling me I have to do something, anything. But she also says It’s nearly impossible to be successful without a ged and diploma. So then when she asks about what my plan is or if I’ve been looking into classes/ged, I get another multiple day episode.


And this is how it’s become a loop:

**Need GED to find decent work -&gt; Need classes or studying for the test -&gt; Have a panic attack within 5 minutes of focusing on any GED related classes/tests/ect. -&gt; Distance myself and become secluded for MONTHS -&gt; Get back to feeling “normal” -&gt; Realize I need to work eventually to support myself, as my parents won’t be around forever -&gt; look at nearby jobs -&gt; see that nearly every job requires ged/diploma -&gt; Panic attack -&gt; Restart cycle.**


This happens multiple times a year and it’s been going on for years now. It’s fucking terrible. Every time anyone brings up college/geds/work/ect, I try to change the subject or distract myself instantly or I’ll have an episode.

I really have no idea how I’m going to get around it. I’ve tried tons of stuff for depression, anxiety and PTSD. Multiple therapists, 30+ different pills, health/lifestyle changea, exercise, ect. - I just can’t beat the loop.

It’s like I know the anxiety and emotions aren’t necessary. I KNOW in my head that it’s just a test, if I fail, I try again. But no matter how many times I tell myself that, I can’t control the episodes I get. That’s the worst part of ptsd in my opinion. The loss of control when it comes to your own feelings/body.",throwaway2k17,2019-02-21 04:01:31,0,593,42.93,8.87,95.25,1.27,12.89,17.2,89.21,51.94,16.53,10.79,10.12,0,0.34,0.34,0,5.73,6.07,11.47,9.11,5.56,7.42,2.36,19.22,4.38,2.02,1.52,1.52,3.71,5.56,1.01,4.22,0.84,1.01,0.84,3.04,0.34,0,0.34,0,13.66,2.87,1.52,1.52,3.71,2.02,3.88,2.02,1.18,0.34,0.51,2.53,0.51,1.69,0.34,0.17,8.26,0.34,3.04,3.04,2.02,1.18,3.54,13.66,1.69,16.02,2.02,6.75,8.09,6.75,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,0.51,0.51,0,0,0,0,26.14,9.11,3.04,0.17,1.52,0,0,2.19,0.34,4.38,1.01,4.38
at2lwb,Night Terrors,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to share my experiences and see if anyone had any tips to help cope with the night terrors from this.

When I was younger about 10ish I used to go to church with my school every sunday as it was a religious school. I don't really remember entirely what happened but I remember feeling trapped, alone and terrified. All I really remember is my gut originally telling me something was bad and that I should get out of there as soon as I can and me telling myself ""It can't be that bad and you are just over reacting"". Then I remember feeling alone and desperate for someone to believe me, I couldn't explain to people what I was feeling as I wasn't sure how. I tried to tell people but I couldn't articulate my words properly.

After that I remember telling myself that if no one else could see the monster behind the mask then I would refuse to grow up in the adults around me and I would make sure that I remembered this so that I would never leave someone alone and stranded like I felt.

After that I started dismantling my self worth, I tried turning myself into a martyr for others along the idea of I couldn't escape but I could help others and I wanted to dedicate myself to hunting down bastards like him and exposing them so other people didn't have to. I taught myself to be super sensitive to people's loneliness and isolation in case something was wrong.

During this time and through my teen years though I started seeing and hearing hallucinations. They included inanimate stuff trying to grow and consume me, death stalking me and voices that had opposite effects at the same time. (like hard and soft, angry and calm. Hard to explain).

I also started having night terrors where I would essentially have to sacrifice myself for others and this usually meant I would have to endure torture and death to save others when the option to walk away would always be there.

I started lucid dreaming to try and smooth out the nightmares and control them but this made it worse as the more I tried to control it the more they would shift into worse creatures and I would start feeling physical pain (bones breaking and limbs ripped off etc).

This caused me to stop fighting it and to stop lucid dreaming and the dreams became more passive. Like more about survival although I still felt the physical pain.

I have been keeping a dream journal and noting patterns and trying to use it to help with the night terrors which helps a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't really like getting outside help as I don't really trust people with this info and I like to solve things alone. Recently though I've been feeling exhausted from dealing with this and I don't really wanna dive into the cause and stuff, I wanna try to avoid it.

&amp;#x200B;

Also as a side note the more I tend to fight for others the less the night terrors seem to bother me. Like if I get mixed up in protecting others who feel alone and terrified as if no one can see what is going on then it seems to be less severe.",themavryan,2019-02-21 04:31:03,0,564,30.69,11.75,86.01,1,24.52,16.67,93.09,59.57,20.21,12.23,11.17,0,0.18,0.18,0.71,7.98,3.9,14.72,8.16,5.14,10.82,2.3,18.62,7.09,4.96,1.6,0.35,2.13,7.27,1.6,5.67,1.6,1.06,1.24,6.56,0,0,0,0.18,17.91,4.43,2.13,3.9,3.19,1.42,4.96,3.9,0.71,0.35,2.48,1.42,0.35,1.06,0,0,8.33,1.42,1.77,3.37,0.53,1.95,6.21,8.69,1.24,10.99,1.24,4.08,5.67,0.53,0.89,0,0.18,0.53,0.35,0.53,0.18,0,0,0,0,9.75,3.9,1.24,0,0.71,0,0,0,0.35,2.13,0.71,0.71
at3dti,"NSFW *TW*r@pe, k!nk. Help. Please","I'm a long term sexaual &amp; emotional abuse victim from my early teens. I'm 20 now but the shit still gets me bad. Kink is how I've always expressed and helped myself handle my trauma and PTSD as well as my BPD. I tend to use sex with my fiance or ex s/os as a weird form of validation. My fiance had been avoiding sex and withholding it since before Valentine's day. Last night he wanted to sleep with me, I really didn't *want* to but I knew it was necessary because if not he would continue withholding for a longer period of time. I go between being very sex obsessed to sex repulsed. Last night, I was sex repulsed. I gave in after numerous attempts to turn me on. I really disassociated during vaginal intercourses, tried to just move my body and get it over with. Then he was going so deep i had a pain in my stomach. I tried to suffer through it. We switched positions a few times so he can ""hurry it up"" as he said, but I couldn't stop whining almost because it hurt.  and he stopped, stood up and said he couldn't hurt me. I said it's fine I'll try to fight through it because I love being close to him. I cried out a few more times and he decided fuck it we're doing anal. I was anally raped. Many times. I tolerate it because he loves it, he prefers it to anything else and I just wanna make him happy. He was sorta slow at first and used a little lube but then he just thrust as deep as possible, mind you the entire time my stomach is still killing me and I've started to cry at this point. He grumbled ""take it all"" I tried to not squirm but fuck it hurt. It hurt so bad. He knows I hate anal. But, here's where it gets complicated .. I had casually brought up consensual non-consent (essentially, a rape fantasy) to him a few times and the sub reddits related. He has no idea anything about BDSM. Subspace. Aftercare. Ect. A rape scene in my mind I think wouls be nice because it either helps me cope with my trauma or it causes extreme emotional damage, thanks BPD for the self destructive tendencies...but that kind of stuff is previously talked about, planned, safe words, limits drawn, ect. So is he just oblivious to the need for that stuff ? Or l did he disregard my well being for his own pleasure?  He didn't get off because I kept squirming away and ran into the bathroom and cried for a few minutes, disguising it as just cleaning up lube. He brought our cat in to check up on me. When I came back into the bedroom after I finished cleaning he passed out. I just sat there and cried. I changed into something that didn't show any skin because I felt gross me Isplit the entire night and I'm doing it so badly today and can't think of anything but the bad stuff about him. I know I love him and care but splitting is causing me to not want to be near him. We were cuddling a few minutes ago and he put his hand in my shirt, I pulled him away and he whined a little but then went back to bed. His touch made me feel gross, like I was used up and thrown away. I feel so on edge and jumpy today now. 
What do I do? I'm not leaving him, so please go somewhere else with that bs.. how do I talk to him about it? Is it wrong I don't want to do anal? How do I fix this mess?",throwthisoutplease99,2019-02-21 05:52:52,8,642,23.65,23.68,75.99,1,13.1,13.08,90.97,57.32,21.96,16.2,10.12,0.62,0.16,5.3,0,5.61,3.43,12.62,7.48,5.92,9.81,1.87,18.69,5.76,2.18,0.93,0.31,1.87,8.88,2.49,6.23,0.31,1.71,1.71,9.03,0.31,0.47,0,5.61,13.24,2.02,2.96,1.71,2.34,0.78,4.36,2.8,0.16,0.78,1.71,4.36,1.87,0.16,1.87,0.16,6.39,2.02,1.09,1.4,0.78,1.25,7.79,9.81,0.93,15.73,2.65,6.54,7.01,0.16,0.62,0.47,0,0,0.16,1.87,0.62,0.78,0.16,0.31,0,16.51,7.32,2.96,0,0.16,0.93,0.16,0.16,0.62,2.8,0.31,1.09

I’ll never believe that shooting up a crowd is the right thing to do but I understand why people do it. Why is everyone so hellbent on making the world shittier with their hate and negativity? Why is it so hard for people to just be good? No one is going to listen to this or change just because I care about living in a safer and better world. I’m over it. I’m done trying.

I get to see a student getting stabbed and bleed out in front of me, and I get to see him fucking shudder and he takes his last breath. THERES NO FUCKING GOOD LEFT ANYMORE AND I KNOW THAT NOW. I just wish someone would have told me sooner and maybe I wouldn’t have fought so hard. It would be better to just be fucking dead.

I've posted here a couple of times, ptsd kicks my ass with anxiety and depression, I've got issues with family that caused said ptsd.


So, I have been obsessing with getting an apology from one family member. Said fam had violated a personal boundary and outed me (I'm NB, present as my assigned gender but am working toward presenting as my preferred gender), and had then shoved me back into the closet in a verbally abusive manner.


It was scarring to say the least.

Except, I think I'm beginning to recover. I'm still obsessing over resolving this, but more in a manner of ""How I am going to tell fam to fuck off forever"" instead of ""How I am going to make fam apologize to me for everything they have ever done to me"". Therapist has been working with me on getting past this. Partners have been supporting me as best they can. I'm reclaiming myself slowly but surely.

My mantra is slowly morphing into a line from one of my favorite songs, ""*Just know this too shall pass*"".

I think that my barfday gift to myself is gonna be that tatooed on one wrist with a mobius strip/ring, and a blessing from my faith on the other.

This was added to the OCD and generalized anxiety I’ve had since childhood. I feel like I’m losing this war and I just don’t want to keep fighting. I am to a place where I daily unravel and sob, wail, scream uncontrollably for hours until I pass out or someone gets me medical attention. I can’t stop reliving my trauma.

I want to forget the septic shock and feeling the most unbearable pain while knowing I was in organ failure. I want to forget getting pregnant and learning I was due on my dads birthday. I lost him years ago and he was everything, I was elated. Until the worst happened and I lost the pregnancy. I want to forget them strapping my knees with belts to the stirrups. I want to forget the two doses of fentanyl/versed not working and being lucid during the manual dilation and hearing the sounds of losing my baby. I want to forget when later that year I died and it took 40 minutes of CPR, drugs, intubation and ventilation to bring me back. I came back twice before the third time saved me. I wish I didn’t remember waking up on a ventilator with a tube in my lungs. I wish I could forget the faces of my nurses and doctors, their panic and tears in the eyes of the nurse by my side - Cara - I’ll never forget her name. I lost consciousness while Cara cried over me and told me to hang on.

atieh3,What do you do when your best friend &amp; coworker becomes a trigger?,"Backstory: I moved to a new state and started a new job a little over 2 years ago, and while I get along with people fine, I don't make friends easily because of my trust issues. Still I managed to make good friends with one of my coworkers. For almost a year, we hung out almost everyday and did pretty much everything together (including vacations) and were very close. She even brought me with her when she took a new job.

I got badly triggered during the Kavanaugh/Ford media debacle. My friend wanted me to talk to her about what was going on with me and I resisted for a long time. (I lost my last best friend 10 years ago after telling her about my rape, so I generally keep shit to myself now.) Eventually I opened up and told her. Her reaction sucked, but she has lived a pretty privileged and trauma-free life so I didn't expect her to get it. And then we stopped hanging out. Suddenly she was always busy, and found other people to spend all her time with. She was my only friend in this whole state, so it sucks a lot. Worse, we share an office and many job responsibilities. So we still have to communicate and I have to pretend like it doesn't hurt.

Lately I've started getting really panicky about simply talking to her. Like heart rate &gt;100bpm panicky. My blood pressure at work this morning was 139/108. Its getting worse.

atiuwj,"I badly hurted someone as a kid, it still haunts me","This event had me deeply traumatized as a child and I never talk about it. I decided I needed to in order to finally get over it so here I am. 
I am not saying I have or had ptsd, I'm just sharing a story and want to discuss it. 

*If you're uncomfortable with injuries, stop right here

Basicly, when I was 12 years old (am now 17) I went on a camping trip with my best friend and his family. That friend and I really liked building stuff and we decided we were going to get some hazel to make bows and arrows. 
Like all 12 years old boys, we liked to tease each other and my friend went hard on me because I had trouble cutting the rope for my bow. After a while, I ended up taking this teasing way to seriously and I wanted to prove him I was just as strong as him. I was in this mindset when he asked me to cut a piece of string he was holding right over his leg. I chopped the string with unreasonable force and didn't pay attention to where the blade was gonna end up. Not surprisingly, the blade ended up in his thigh near his knee. 
At that point I completely froze up for a few seconds and then realized I needed to get some help so I ran to his uncle who was probably 100 meters away.  I felt so weird I think I barely breathed for the whole run. 

Adults quickly took care of him as I sat completely silent. His father took him to the hospital which wasn't close since we were camping. He got a bunch of stitches and everyone seemed to think I didn't miss the artery by much. I felt an enormous amount of guilt and basicly could not stop thinking ""I could have killed him"". The very next day my friend was already walking which didn't help since I was trying my best to avoid him. At the time I really thought I could have killed him but I now doubt it. Anyway. 

In term, he healed perfectly and we still are friends today even though I avoided him for mounts after the event. To this day I still have unconfortable burst of guilt when thinking about it but it is nothing compared to the flashbacks I used to have. I never told my parents about the story and went through the consequences on my own. The worst part of it was being so young and mentally fragile when it happened.

I definitely am  not saying I had ptsd but reading your stories helped me so I decided to share mine.

I’m on hyper alert all the time and It’s gone down to me knowing the sound of his foot steps, when he’s usually in the kitchen or going up or down stairs, and knowing if he’s gonna walk in the hall way the same time I have. Sometimes if we get home at the same time i’ll wait inside my car until he goes first and i’ll go in about 5 minutes after to make sure he’s not still taking off his shoes and hanging up his keys.  I feel like i’m living in a constant state of fear and just hearing his voice sends shivers down my spine and makes me dissociate bad and have flashbacks. Do i muster up the courage to talk to him about it? To tell him how bad he’s potentially fucked me up?  He grew up in PR and used to tell me that over there if you had “issues” they weren’t real and to get over it.

atjt7n,Reporting? (TW: r*pe),"Good day, all. 

I survived an abusive relationship. I'm a college student and a very active leader on my campus. The relationship had emotional manipulation, verbal abuse, and nonconsensual sex acts. To this day, it's still a little hard for me to use the right language and to understand what happened. 

But anyways, the person who did these things is someone who goes to my university. I pursued an institutional No-Contact Order against him, which was granted at the end of last semester. This semester, though, I thought it would be enough - but it isn't. I have crippling anxiety to the point where I've been scared to leave my room out of fear of seeing him. I can't go to the dining hall, since I'm afraid I'll see him. I can't go to events. I even started skipping class. When I see him, I have severe psychological and physiological panic attacks (I start crying, I shake, I sweat, I've almost passed out, my heart rate increases, I throw up or something... It's bad). He has classes near mine and it's been hell. I started feeling really unsafe and skipping class and I've been devastated by having to see him so much. I will do anything to avoid feeling that fear, it's unlike anything I could ever imagine or articulate.

I decided to file a Title IX report against him. I wrote a statement and compiled pictures and screenshots. I have a ton of follow up meetings and interviews and everything (alongside my classes and extracurriculars) and I feel rather overwhelmed. 

Essentially, I was wondering if anyone had any experiences of reporting r*pe or anything like that? How did it go? Was it a legal investigation or something else (mine is an institutional Title IX one)? Does anyone have any advice for how to be calm and clear my head? 

TL;DR: What can I expect now that I opened a Title IX investigation for sexual misconduct? How can I stop worrying?

atkw24,Memory Erasing Drugs for PTSD,"Please let me know if I am out of my place here and I'll delete the post. I'm doing research to write a paper for an ethics class, and as someone who does not have a first hand experience with PTSD, I'm hoping to gain an authentic understanding from someone who does - that's why I came here. 

&amp;#x200B;

The essay topic:

""Research shows that there is potential for new treatments for PTSD. The treatment involves direct erasing or modifying of traumatic memories using drugs or other procedures. The effect promoted by some researchers is that the traumatic memories are simply 'erased'. 

Is this something that we should have available as treatment for suitable patients?""

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering how someone who suffers from PTSD views this potential treatment and how you feel it would change your sense of self or identity, and if it's something you'd be interesting in taking. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

atled5,I didn’t even realize how fucked up it was until now,"Fuck I wish I could just delete the whole thing from my brain. I knew the psych facility was bad with health code violations, questionable safety, fucked up ethics and all that abusive neglectful shit. 


But I knew that some things were wrong like rotten food, basic rights like phone calls, visitors, and showers being a privilege to be taken away at will.  Or even being denied a doctor or medical tests when my pre existing conditions were acting up. Some things I didn’t notice the extent until later like I didn’t realize how badly I’d been gaslighted and manipulated until the brink of insanity. 


But I didn’t even realize how fucked certain “minor” things were. Like being forced to wake up at 6 am when I got a cold or how I wasn’t allowed to even sleep during “reflection time” which was basically a 3 hour time out style punishment for breaking rules or trash talking the facility, or refusing to eat the expired food. They would take away all my things like books or drawing stuff- anything to occupy the time and I wasn’t allowed to sleep either. They would stand there and poke me telling me “no sleeping” every time I tried to sleep to pass the time.


I was at my weakest when I went there- because I was depressed with a bunch of mental illness but now I still feel so broken. I am angry and sad and I was talking to my grandma yesterday and she was appalled at the things I just thought were minorly shitty. I guess it puts it into perspective.



But my dad still thinks that I’m exaggerating and over reacting because the facility flat out denies most of the stuff, making me seem insane.

atn04m,Of PTSD and romantic relationships.,"I was constantly abused (verbal, physical and sexual) for 5 years. I won't enter into details but it definitely left me scared. I was diagnosed with PTSD a couple of years ago and already started treatment. Even now the symptoms are very present but fairly manageable. My problem comes to this:
I don't think (or feel) that I deserve to be loved. 
I guess it kinda has something to do with my abuser's verbal attacks, but I just feel that I'm so dirty, soiled and broken that I want to avoid any meaningful relationship with anyone. And I feel I'm ""protecting"" others from soiling themselves with, well, me.
I've dated a couple of times but never after a second date. I tell them that my job is too busy or that my family has some meeting, after a while they just stop texting. I know isolation is a symptom of depression, but I just don't feel like I deserve to be loved. My relationship with friends and family is very good btw.

atnxj0,Looking for advice,"I have never been to this subreddit before so hello all!  Sorry for the fresh account but I would rather this not be tied to my main reddit account.


This is a fairly long story and I really cant think of a TLDR version of it so please bare with me.


I have been out of the army for 10 years now, my deployment was in 2007 - 2008 in Baghdad, mostly a motor pool fobbit but had 3 months in a highly active small medevac fob where we were being attacked by mortars and RPGs on a daily basis.

So 2 weeks ago I had a fight with my closing manager at my secondary 5 hour a week job, I was doing absolutely nothing wrong but my manager flipped out on me and was saying I was not doing any work and was stealing from the company.  I immediately got very defensive and nearly blacked out in anger and was screaming at her.  I got sent home with the threat of police if I didnt and dont remember too much after that. 

The next morning I woke up completely drenched in sweat and terrified and I had no idea of what.  The only thing I really remember is being very cold and being curled up in the bathtub/shower with the hot water turned on and being scared.

I ended up falling asleep again and feeling perfectly normal when waking up.  I did not think much of it, maybe a 24 hour flu or something.

Yesterday however I woke up in the morning full of adrenaline and just in GO MODE.  I did not shower, brush my teeth, put on deodorant, nothing.

When I got to my full-time job I realised there was something wrong and I told my boss I did not feel right.  He saw that I was extremely on edge and said it's ok just stay here in the shop and we will find you something to do here ( I'm a golf course groundskeeper)  shortly after he came up to me again and asked what I was doing.  Apparently I was pacing back and forth and doing circles.  He sent me to the fire department next door who immediately called an ambulance because I was nearly in cardiac arrest with my heart beating at 180 BPMs.  The fire department guys gave me an IV and some kind of beta blocker and I started to feel more like myself pretty fast, by the time the ambulance got there i was perfectly fine besides being very embarrassed.

The next morning I woke up fine and did my normal routine but was able to piece things together what happened the day before.  

I remembered I actually grabbed my .45 out of my nightstand and went to work with it.  No one at my work saw it so I must have kept it in my truck or something, I dont remember.

This is what scared me the most, I brought a loaded weapon to work and have no memory of it at all.  I can not stop thinking what would have happened if I killed one of my co-workers.

I already turned my gun (only one I have) over to the police after explaining what happened and informed my boss about it (maybe not the best thing to do because now this has justifiably became a giant concern to them)  fortunately they are being very understanding of the situation and told me to take the rest of the week off with pay until I see the mental health person at the VA clinic on monday morning.

One of my NCOs while at the medevac fob accused me of the same thing about not doing my job because I overslept for my night time watch duty shift.  That is what I am thinking set off some kind of trigger in my head at work but I'm just speculating right now.

Anyway that's my story and was curious if anyone else has experienced something similar.  I have never had any anxiety or anything before this so I dont really know what to make of it considering the only combat I saw was 12 years ago.",PFCTayTay,2019-02-22 14:42:33,1,704,36.3,10.58,97.37,12.57,24.28,14.49,91.62,61.22,17.61,12.07,10.8,0.28,0.14,0.57,0.28,5.54,5.68,13.49,9.66,7.67,7.24,2.84,17.33,5.11,1.7,1.7,1.99,1.56,3.84,1.42,2.41,0.85,0.85,0.14,4.83,0,0.14,0.14,0.57,13.35,3.12,0.99,1.14,3.98,1.7,4.12,2.84,0.85,0.43,1.28,1.56,0.71,0.71,0,0.14,5.97,0.57,1.28,2.84,1.28,0.71,9.38,6.68,0.14,16.34,1.85,7.81,7.1,2.98,0.71,0.71,0.57,0,0.14,0.71,0,0.28,0.28,0,0.14,7.39,3.84,1.42,0,0,0,0.14,0.43,0,0.57,0.85,0.14
ato5xd,"Not ""feeling it""?","Sorry for posting so much. I had a question for you all. 

I've been trying to reflect on my trauma and be aware of what happened to me. That said, sometimes I forget things and remember them randomly later. Atop that, I have not cried about my situation. I have not stopped and felt any type of sadness about it, and I really wish I could. When I'm exposed to triggers, I feel anxiety and even have panic attacks (nausea, shaking, sweating, crying, etc). But, aside from that, I feel really really numb. 

Does anyone else relate? I want to feel sadness or anger or *something* so I can process it and decrease my anxiety. I've tried so hard, and I just can't. This has been weighing on me for so long.

atoh0a,Do I want to risk having a conversation with my sister?,"I came here because I thought someone might have advice . I grew up in a verbally and emotionally abusive family (Grandparents, mother, half sister) and after 30 years am dealing with the repercussions still. Both grandparents and mom have passed but my sister who is 11 years older than me is still here and lives in the same town. My brain never really wrapped around how bad these people affected me until the last year. My sister and I got close after my mom passed and the abuse subsided. My sister even acknowledged that she gave me a hard time but that was it. I tried to follow up with, ""Yeah it's really really messed me up"" and her manipulation continued by her saying, ""Oh it wasn't that bad"". Things were starting to ease up and I felt myself growing finally and met my now husband who has helped me tremendously dredge through all this trauma (other things happened not just the abuse). About a year ago my sister crossed a line. She started into me like I was 13 years old again and I shrunk back into my 13 year old crippled mind. She finally left my house that she barged into (and almost knocked my husband over when he tried to stop her) and that's been the last time I've seen her since. I cut all communication off from her and told her ""there will be a time that we can go into this but now is not happening"". I was suicidal for 8+ hrs. I should have went to the hospital but I couldn't take myself away from my animals. So I hunkered down and waited it out. My husband was stuck to my side to make sure I didnt try anything because right after she left I immediately went and grabbed a knife and was intending to cut but he wrestled it out of my hands and locked them and all the medication up. It took me a few days to come back to myself and once I did I remembered how horrible it was growing up, all the angst and loneliness and the intense need to leave my life. I'm currently in EMDR therapy to deal with this and other trauma but on Christmas I got a text telling me Merry Christmas. I had a bit of a panic attack but eventually texted back Merry Christmas and that was that. She texted me the day after my birthday and told me she didnt want to text me on my birthday and ruin it but she said happy birthday and she loved me. (No panic attack this time!) And I replied back that I love her too. Because I do, shes my sister but damn did her and my family fuck my head up. I don't think that I want to go back to having so much to do with her but I had the thought of sitting down to talk to her and explaining where Im at.

atolvo,Should I go for a diagnosis?,"TLDR: Sorry for the long post just looking for clarification on if what I have been experiencing through my teenage years is somehow connected to PTSD

I'm currently 17 years old and after research I seem to have almost every single symptom of PTSD. The main reason I found this is because anytime I am yelled at by anyone (mainly parents) I instantly go into full panic mode and it feels like my whole body freezes up. This happens even when I know they aren't trying to yell at me but are just raising their voice. The reason I am confused is because I cannot remember a traumatic event in my life that would be substantial enough to cause something like this. The symptoms I experience that may or may not be connected to PTSD include:

Fear and avoidance of situations where either being yelled at or being made fun of is a possibility
Extreme social anxiety to the point where it is difficult for me to make new friends outside of my group and has caused me to avoid relationships because I am afraid of rejection/being laughed at by the school
Paranoia involving being attacked or bad things happening to family members even though I live in a suburb that never has crime
Difficulty sleeping with no specific cause, usually at night I just am constantly in my thoughts playing out millions of different scenarios in my head
Feelings of isolation, mainly that I am somehow not like everyone else because of all these symptoms and my ADHD diagnosis, this causes me to isolate myself and run away from problems such as walking away from a conversation with my parents if I get yelled at for something
And finally the strongest symptom I have is constantly replaying bad moments in my life or imagining bad things that have never happened

Unrelated to these symptoms I find that I struggle with addiction/self damaging behavior as just 6 months ago I finally was able to stop smoking weed daily (after a consecutive 4 months straight) due to the fact that it relieved many of these negative feelings. The only reason I was able to stop was because I was caught being high by my parents and immediately had a panic attack that ended up with an ambulance ride to the hospital.",pj0809,2019-02-22 15:47:09,5,398,56.69,13.99,96.84,1,56.86,23.62,94.47,58.04,16.08,9.8,9.3,0,0,0,0.5,6.28,4.52,16.33,9.55,5.78,6.03,2.01,16.33,5.03,2.51,1.01,1.26,1.76,8.29,1.26,7.04,2.51,1.51,1.01,4.27,1.01,0.25,0,0,17.09,4.27,3.52,1.26,5.53,1.76,3.77,3.27,0.25,1.51,1.01,4.02,0.75,3.02,0,0.25,8.29,2.51,0.75,2.26,0.25,2.51,4.02,9.3,0.5,16.08,1.76,6.53,7.54,0.5,0.75,0.25,0,0,0,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,0,5.03,1.51,0.75,0.5,0,0.25,0,0,0,0.5,1.01,0.5

When I finally get him to smoke a bowl to back down from the dark edge.  


When he mellows enough pull me aside, ""I have something to tell you and I'm only going to say it once.  If you ask me about it later I will deny it.""


When he slings a heavy arm on my shoulder and says, through hopeless tears, ""I killed a lot of people.  They made me do it.""  And then clings to me and cries into my neck.  


It was over two decades ago when he experienced this.  He told me he never saw armed combat.  He told me he never fired his gun.  And yet I learned not to come up to him quietly while he was asleep, lest he startle awake and try to choke me before realizing who I am.  


... he tells me this, cries into my neck.  Then pulls back and says, ""What am I doing here? What were we talking about?  I can't remember but this doesn't feel right.  I.. I need to go.""  


Wanders off but keeps coming back to me, like I am a port in the storm.  His anchor.  ""What am I supposed to be doing?""  he asks, as simply as my 6 year old son might.

atqbu6,I can't stop having nightmares about my abuser (tw maybe?),"I haven't seen him in three years, haven't heard from him in two. I try to ignore the feelings that he's left with me. I thought I was doing so much better. I have a man in my life who truly loves and cares about me. So why, laying in bed next to this lovely man, am I having nightmares about my abuser? The nightmares all start the same way: I try to call my boyfriend to tell him I love him. When the phone call is answered, my abuser's voice is on the other line. I feel like something is wrong but I don't know what, I don't know it's him yet. I try to tell my boyfriend I love him. My abuser asks if I really mean it, that he's been waiting for me to come back to him and say that. That's when I realize I'm not speaking to my boyfriend. I panic and try to hang up and get away from my abuser, but I feel like I can't get away from him. I feel dirty for telling him I love him, but it wasn't meant for him! How could I have called the wrong person? I feel like my boyfriend will hate me for telling my abuser I love him, and that he'll leave me, even though I know outside of this dream world he would never do that. The nightmare ends.

I've had different variations of this dream over the past few months. I feel lost. I don't want to tell my boyfriend because what if he gets upset that I'm thinking about my abuser after so long (even though I know that's an irrational fear, and he'd never do that).

atqlg5,I just had a nightmare for the first time in maybe a year and I am in full blown panic mode.,"I know it’s because I forced myself to take a nap after 48 hours of manic awakeness without any drugs, but meditation and breathing techniques over many hours. I know that these nightmares mean nothing to me. I don’t know anybody in them. I don’t even think they have to do with me. I just know that I had to keep *fighting*. Physically fighting. For the two hours I got in, my brain was on overload making me paranoid and making me feel like I had to fight the whole fucking world. The more manic I quicker to agitation and wanting to hurt people I am which is new and scary. It’s not like it’s dramatic and I need to go to the hospital or call the police right fucking now, but I used to be one of those people who have had the most loved people in my life brutally murdered, I’ve been raped and abused, and other horrible shit has happened to me yet I never believed in the death penalty personally because “it never brings my loved one back” and now I’m like FUCK YEH FRY EM. I lack empathy. My mind is racing a mile a minute along with my heart. I have my service dog in training curled up along side me but he isn’t trained for this yet. He isn’t technically trained for anything yet except be calm in public and stay under my desk or chairs. He’s still really young but he’s trying his best to comfort me right now I think. My stomach is literally turning with nausea. I feel even worse than when I was just awake for 48 hours. I should have just waited until 9 pm to take my meds and sleep instead of trying to take a nap without them, but now I know. What do I fucking do, guys? I’m fucking scared. I don’t want to have nightmares. I don’t want to be in panic mode. I feel so sick and angry and tired. My eyes keep rolling back in my head but I’m forcing myself to stay awake and alert.

atrxln,I have PTSD because of a volitile relationship,"It's a very long story and it's pretty dark. But here goes. I was with this girl for three years and we had a house together, pets, you name it. Well we started fighting a lot and she had self harm issues. Our fights would start out small and next thing you know, we were screaming in the house, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg. She would lock herself in a room and try to cut herself in the middle of these fights, so I would break into the room to stop her (my mind immediately shifting to I'm not fighting with her anymore, I'm going to try and stop her and show her I love her), but she never let up. She would resort to brutally beating me in the face to get me away from her and say the most horrible things to me. She would tell me I was a loser, I was ugly, fat, and all sorts of things that I refuse to remember. I would try to leave and blow off the steam and she would force her way in front of me and threaten me that she was going to kill herself or that we're done if I leave. And we had the cops called on us three times, because we were so loud. I lied when they said was anyone hurt, as I sat there with a developing black eye and her sitting there with her cuts. I lied to my friends and said that I got my black eye from work. I remember one time specifically was at AWA, and all of my friends that were there, surrounded me and wouldn't leave me alone about my black eye, which wasn't the first one. I lied to them again and then I told them I had to pee, and went to the bathroom and cried really hard. Fast forward to the end, a couple of years ago. I had a concussion at work. I fell into a running compactor and hit my head, and my boss saved my life. I completely forgot the previous two months, including my sister getting engaged and everything. They wouldn't let me drive or watch movies or anything until I recovered. It was a nightmare. Well I started getting my memory back and she started a fight with me because my friend was coming to see me and she ""wanted to do her workout."" it escaladed very quickly to the same routine as before only this time I broke a statue that we got together and I threw the flowers I got her on the floor and the cops were called again and said one of us had to leave for the night. She kicked me out and broke up with me and never let me come back. I couldn't drive at the time she made me stay outside until my mom came and got me. I begged her not to do it, because I was in love with her despite everything and she treated me like a criminal and condemned me. She tried to turn all of my friends against me (which failed horribly for the most part) and told everyone that I was the one abusing her. I never touched her like that and I never said anything so horrible to her. I treated her like gold 95% of the time and I cared about her more than anything. I left her a long letter on the porch a week after all of this, explaining how much she meant to me and that I wanted a new start with her and she called the cops to tell me to leave her alone and told everyone that I was a psycho.

For example, I was dog sitting for my sister. I have a crazy strong bond with the dog but he’s not trained well. I had been awake for 3 days (mania). Dog starts barking at the window. I’m sure it was the loud noise in my usually quiet house. 

Suddenly the dog is right in front of me. He’s trying to bite me. I jump back and he cowers in fear. This happens 3 times. Suddenly the dog is in the living room on the rug. He’s on his side with one leg up in the air. He puts his leg down. Then back up. 3 times. 

I’m freaking out. My 11 y/o son is there the whole time. He’s laughing but it’s sooo loud. I shout at him to stop. I’m scared of the dog so I get him out to the enclosed porch. Called my sister and tried to explain. 

Long story short, my whole family is mad at me. I didn’t understand why at the time. I was well into a manic episode so I’m sure I sounded like a lunatic trying to explain to anyone who would listen. 

Ended up in the psych ward. Doc says it was a PTSD “emotional” flashback. Eventually I realized that the dog never tried to attack. He was licking my hand. It startled me and when I jumped back so did he. He knew something was wrong with me. My son saw the whole thing. It’s like my brain skipped time and repeated one part. 

Turns out it had happened before but I didn’t realize it. I left my husband of 11 years because I thought he pushed me into the wall. Actually my brain skipped him walking towards me. Suddenly he was right in front of me and it startled me so I fell back into the wall. I actually shoved him back really hard out of pure reflex. It started this whole chain of events. 

Now I don’t know what’s real and what isn’t. What if I’m at the shop and it happens and I attack a stranger? 

Anyone else ever had something like this happen? What are your attacks like? Sorry so long. 

TL;DR PTSD flashbacks completely cause brain hops. I don’t even know how to describe it.",bettysworld,2019-02-23 00:56:46,4,430,31.56,21.45,96.16,4.51,8.96,13.02,90,59.77,22.09,15.58,11.16,0,0.47,3.95,0,6.51,5.81,13.26,10,7.21,5.58,1.86,19.53,2.79,1.63,2.33,2.09,1.16,4.88,1.4,3.49,0.93,1.16,0.23,7.91,1.4,0,0.47,4.65,10.47,2.79,1.16,0.47,2.09,1.4,3.02,3.26,0.47,2.09,0.47,2.56,1.4,1.16,0,0,5.35,0.93,1.16,2.33,0.23,0.7,7.21,10,0.47,19.07,2.33,10.93,6.98,0.47,0.7,1.4,0.23,0,0,1.16,0.23,0.47,0,0.47,0,17.44,10.23,0.47,0,0.23,0.93,0,0,0.93,3.95,0.47,0.23
atv9ke,Advice on therapy,"Hi, I’m new to reddit so I apologize if I’m in the wrong thread or anything..

I just had a few questions I was hoping to get some advice on. I have never been diagnosed with PTSD but I have experienced a lot of trauma in my past that is currently surfacing and making it very hard to function or go on in life.

I was recently hospitalized but I didn’t find it helpful as I was unable to talk about anything that happened and the only thing taught was DBT, which isn’t bad, just not what I felt I needed.

Anyway, through that stay I was set up to see a behavioral health social worker who I was told deals with trauma. My fear is I don’t know much about the behavioral approach and whether or not it would be helpful, as I didn’t find it helpful during my hospital stay.

I am scared because I really need and want the right treatment and counseling because I cannot live this way anymore. Do you think that I should be seeing an actual psychologist or do a lot of social workers treat trauma?

I just know when I was in the hospital I wasn’t listened to at all. I tried to explain how it is affecting my life, how disconnected from reality I feel, and how awful it was but they just said “well, you must be depressed.” Which I am, but that’s really not nearly the half of it. 

I just need suggestions on treatment I guess, and what has worked for you if you’ve had experience with counseling.

Any advice is welcome, thank you.",clockworks3825,2019-02-23 04:59:56,2,279,7.76,12.57,89.94,20.36,19.93,14.7,96.06,63.8,21.51,13.62,11.47,0,1.79,0,0.36,7.89,3.94,11.11,13.98,7.17,9.68,3.58,24.73,4.3,1.08,3.58,0.36,2.51,6.09,2.87,3.23,0.72,0,0.36,9.32,0,0,0,0,20.07,3.58,2.51,3.58,5.73,1.08,7.53,3.23,0.72,0.72,1.08,3.23,0,3.23,0,0,6.81,2.51,1.79,1.79,0.72,0.72,8.96,14.34,0.36,9.68,2.15,5.38,2.87,2.51,0.36,0,0,0,0,1.08,0,0.36,0,0.36,0.36,12.9,4.66,3.94,0,0,0.36,0,0,0.72,3.23,0,0
atvyux,"Dumped by email 7 yrs ago, I still think about it multiple times every day","Before sharing all the context, I'd like to say that I had professional help for at least one year after the incident and that my goal here is seeking advice about whether contacting my offender or not. Anyway, thank you all for sharing your stories here. It encouraged me to do the same.

Seven years ago, in a Monday afternoon, my girlfriend sent me a short email saying that she doesn't want to stay with the anymore. It happened after a few weeks where she was distant and confused. During this period, I offered total support, saying that no matter what was happening, I loved her and want to make things work out. In her message she didn't provide much detail. Tired, hurt, and proud, I reply to the message promptly saying she was rude and inconsiderate, but if she wants to dump me, fine.
I promise myself I've crawled enough for someone who never wanted me in the first place. It was 7 years ago and We never talk to each other again.

Turns out that our entire relationship last 2 years. From knowing her and being rejected a few times to make out a few times, from quitting her because she won't like to be my girlfriend, to spend holidays with her entire family as his official boyfriend. I told a love her a million times. She showed affection, but never at the same level.

The last 8 months of our relationship, when we finally were stable, was the time she moved back to her hometown -- a 3-hour flight and 5 hours drive from me. That time, I've also got a promoted on my job, fulfilling a dream of several years. Even the soccer team I support won an important championship for the first time ever. I've never been happier in my entire life.

Her message came only one week after my promotion, and seeing everything on perspective now, it explains a huge part of my failure at the new job. After 6 years in the company, I last only 10 months in the new hole. I suffered lots of harassment by my former manager and peers, but I know I was vulnerable and weak to fight back because losing her was a huge blow. 

In a few weeks, I start to see an ex-girlfriend again, we saw each other for about 6 months, and I dumped her. I simply couldn't be a good person with her. It happened again four years after she left me. It wasn't with the same intensity, but my then girlfriend just notice I couldn't love her the same way I love the one who dumped me by email in 2012. In one way or another, I guess all my other relationships were doomed since the beginning for the same reason.

I'm writing this at Saturday at 4:00 a.m. It's been very common to me to wake up and think about the moments or dialogs I had with my ex-girlfriend. During the last seven years, I did a very good job removing triggers for that. Living in the same neighborhood where we've been together was so painful that I made mine out of my own country. It helped a lot but didn't solve the problem.

Two-hour sessions of therapy twice a week, antidepressants, antianxiety medication, weed, professional success, love from family and friends,  new relationships, new country, seven years waiting time to fix the wounds… and I'm still ruminating about this every single day, every day and it's always hard to stop. 

The only thing I never tried was to write back to her. I'm considering doing it on my own sake. I think it's fair to let her know how much damage she caused. At the same time, I know it won't fix the past, and the perspective of having an inconsiderate or pitty answer, already made me feel humiliated.

If you read this far, thank you. Any advice is helpful. Especially if you had the same doubt and confronted your past. How's your life after that?",jubash,2019-02-23 06:23:22,3,694,53.46,57.44,90.76,33.22,16.93,14.99,94.52,54.18,19.02,13.54,8.07,0.86,1.01,3.6,0,5.48,7.2,12.54,6.63,5.91,5.76,2.16,15.13,5.48,2.88,1.3,3.75,3.89,7.06,3.75,3.31,0.58,0.86,0.86,13.11,0.29,1.15,3.46,0.29,11.67,2.31,1.87,1.44,2.02,2.88,2.88,1.73,0.58,0.58,0.58,2.31,0.14,1.44,0,0,9.51,4.76,2.45,1.87,1.3,0.86,6.63,6.77,0.58,20.75,1.87,6.48,12.82,2.74,0.86,0.43,0.14,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,0,0,0.14,16.28,5.91,6.2,0.14,0,0.14,0,0.86,0,3.03,0,0

aty77s,"Yesterday I was catcalled, freaked out and exploded (Mentions TW: sa,ed)","So I was with a friend, at the mall. As I am a very large woman, I am used to being shouted ugly things at, being taken ""hidden"" pictures of, or just plain laughed at. And so when I heard two men at a table say ""Look, the one that comes walking here now"", and I just knew that it was me they meant, because my friend is a very pretty and normal-looking woman, and and they sounded cruel already, so I braced for laughter, or a cruel comment or something to that effect.

And then what happened was that they said ""oh that one"" and mentioned my haircolour, ""she has a nice big ass"", and I felt such a pang of humiliation. If he had said it softly to his friend, it wouldn't have been so bad, but he damn near shouted it, and I just felt so revolting. It took me three seconds to decide, and I asked my friend to hold my bag and I turned and went back and asked him if he was aware that I could hear him. He blamed it on being under the influence. I replied ""well then go home,or behave properly"" and left, and it took me three full hours to really analyze what happened. 

I got scared. I have felt safe in this body for so long, because most men are repulsed by me/my size, and that makes it safe, and this was my town, and suddenly my town isn't safe anymore. (I was sexually abused for 12 years) so now I am afraid of being raped again, and I feel like I should gain weight, since not even this weight is safe. The flashbacks have been kicking my ass since yesterday,and I am so tired.

atyijj,New to PTSD mid-30’s male,"If you were to meet me on the street, or observe me order a coffee, you’d never have picked me for the life I have lived. I meet people who talk about a tough upbringing and are left in shock when I rattle off mine in a quick fire 90 second run down, and then say it’s only the tip of the iceberg. My psychiatrist (NHS) is astounded that despite the horrors I managed to steer away from serious substance/alcohol misuse, homelessness, and maintain a clean criminal record. It’s no wonder that I should have a bit of PTSD right?

Well I have skirted around the symptoms never truly applying them to me and live situations, plus having to manage ASD, ADHD and bipolar I’ve had more than enough to be working on. But after a tirade yesterday in the car with the folks, similar to other very brief outbursts with other family followed by complete shame at my behaviour and disappointment at still sweeping up broken pieces from an already fractured, splintered and cracked childhood.

So enough is enough and I am here to learn. I’ve been conducted my own home therapy using the publishings from FDA approved MDMA research for diagnosed PTSD sufferers which has allowed me to unlock a lot of things holding me back from being someone who isn’t afraid to say hi to others in the town, offer help and assistance to others without fear of judgment, deepen the relationships with my family, and proposing to the woman of my dreams. The 8th serious relationship partner in my life, and one who’ve I have made an incredibly close bond with whilst I rebuild myself into the role in life that I have always been yearning for.

My main issue is those live events. How to catch yourself before you ‘jump off at the deep end’ with things - coined by the folks. I respect that I can’t expect anyone around me to accommodate, and I don’t want to either. When my mum said yesterday that sometimes she is afraid of having certain discussions with me based on how I would react, and opting to keep quiet and let sleeping lions lie, I realised that there is an important line of communication broken and that I am limiting myself in finding a solution to stop these outbursts.

I managed to calm myself and make a promise with my folks that if I were to shut up and think every time they say ‘going off at the deep end’, would they return the favour by highlighting my behaviours as soon as they appear instead of keeping quiet and hoping it doesn’t escalate. That was really positive but I can’t rely on this for the rest of my life. What do you experts suggest? When I mean experts I mean those who are living and breathing it, no professionals thank you.",2814-2815,2019-02-23 10:38:10,4,490,61.85,29.77,83.04,29.17,27.22,16.73,87.35,57.76,17.76,11.63,9.39,0,1.22,0.2,0.82,6.12,6.33,16.53,7.96,4.69,7.14,2.04,15.1,5.51,1.63,2.04,0.82,1.22,4.9,2.45,2.24,1.02,0,0.61,8.57,1.22,0.2,0.61,0.2,11.43,1.63,2.04,1.84,2.04,1.84,3.67,1.63,0.2,1.22,0.2,3.27,0.41,2.65,0,0.41,6.53,2.04,0.61,3.47,0.41,0.2,3.47,9.59,1.02,14.08,1.84,7.14,5.31,1.84,1.02,0.82,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,0.2,0,11.43,3.06,3.67,0,0,0.41,0,0.41,0.41,2.86,0.41,0.2

So, who am I. Girl of 25. Grown up in a dysfunctional family, I don't want to add too many details so I'll try to keep this short - father was violent, mother depressed, my older sister is in complete isolation since 18. 

I escaped that shithole at 23. However sometime I have this memory that torments me. My boyfriend doesn't know. My (few) friends never knew. My therapist doesn't know.
This memory that torments me is my mother, 7 years ago, that keeps calling me slut.
Why?
Because she was constantly having dreams about me and my father having sex.
She was rejecting me, and insulting me, everyday.
For something in her own head. Something so embarrassing and sad that I cannot tell to anybody.

So, nothing. I don't want nothing in particular here. Just to unload this. Thanks for your attention.

At the hospital I couldn't talk and I do not remember the 3 weeks I was there. I come to realize that it was depersonalization amnesia that I experienced but after I was released I have been way more anxious, self conscious and emotionally numb and detached.

The doctors told me they had to restrain me but it only made it worse because what I was experiencing felt real so I would be trying to get out of them but it as all in my head. Now I wonder if my ADHD is actually a depersonalization disorder or just PAWS from benzos. I cannot sleep more then 3-4 hours without waking up even if I took a bar, but before I would sleep like a baby. Has anyone experienced this? I also have developed AvPD ever since I was released and my life took a 360. I can barely go outside or communicate became of shame if I don't take a benzo to relax. I am back on it so I can continue living like before but I have stopped going to school and have my friend managing my business's. I just want to go back to how I was. I am pretty sure I am depressed and I am seeing a psychiatrist in a couple weeks, I just want to see if anyone has experienced this or have found out that there ADHD was actually derealization but that is for another sub.

TW : Re sub about drunk rape 





Someone posted recently in an “unpopular “ opinion sub that essentially if two people who are drunk have sex, it shouldn’t be considered rape, because they’re both drunk. I foolishly decided to read the opinions thinking that someone would shut this down quickly, but the vast majority of people are victim blaming and shaming the hell out of anyone who disagrees, joking crudely etc. I’m really overwhelmed with how much of a trigger reading all of that was given my very own unfortunate experience. I don’t think about what happened very often and I’ve only told a handful of people, so it really throws me for a loop when I’m moved to the point of tears over a dumb opinion. I guess I’m just looking for some validation from people who have been similarly upset by seemingly innocuous posts.

au7ke4,I’ve become violent towards my boyfriend. I don’t want to be this way. Please help.,"I’ve had PTSD for a while now from childhood sexual abuse, and later domestic violence from my ex. 

One of my worst symptoms is my anger. I develop this temper very quickly over the smallest things and I feel I lose control. I start knocking things off of counters and tables, and I throw things at the wall. 

However, the worst incident is when I shoved my boyfriend. His yelling was very aggressive and triggering, I felt I was having a panic attack. I immediately threw my hands out and pushed his chest, then he got pissed and stormed at me so I put my hand around his throat. 

This is exactly what my ex did to me. He would push, shove, grab my neck, and pin me down on the ground. He would even take it a step further  and squeeze his legs around my stomach forcing me to throw up and not breath. 

I don’t understand how I’ve experienced this before with someone else that now it seems I’ve become exactly what I hated about them. I have never been abusive and I feel disgusted and ashamed of myself. I love my boyfriend so much he has been everything I never had and has never laid a hand on me. He’s the most patient guy I know and he fully understands my diagnoses, but I can’t believe I actually hurt him... 

I’m on anti-depressants and I see a counselor for treatment. I’ve been hospitalized before as well. But I’ve just never stooped this low. I don’t want to be like this and I don’t want to hurt ANYONE.

aua588,It's all a revictimized PTSD invisible person (tw sexual abuse),"I have been on my own since 16 when I left a very abusive family. I did things on my own, I was my own advocate and fought for help and developed independence at an early age and adulthood while navigating the system. I managed to complete high school alone and went to College and never finished, I have worked minimum wage jobs. 

Throughout age 16-23 I was always revictimized because of my health and mental health. Nobody understood me or heard me. I was always unheard and felt invisible. Jumping through hoops and navigating the system while I was in extreme pain physically and emotionally. I never had any breaks. Hospitals suck for mental health and the Canadian Government sucks for mental health for help. 

I learned to shelter myself and do my own things. I became angry and bitter because that is how I found results. I knew when I was angry people heard me but when I wasnt nobody did. Its sad. 

I am 25 now. I struggle with PTSD all stemming from my childhood. Mostly from my father who sexually abused me, a teacher assaulted me, being revictimized again and again. Being attacked three years ago in broad day light by a group of men (I am lucky I am alive), and last year fled family pyshcological abuse. 

I havent worked in a year. I am on social assistance. I have been denied disability and have a lawyer fighting for me to have it and have a Tribunal in the summer. All my life I am always fighting for everything including my own life. 

My PTSD comes and goes. I go to counseling weekly. Its very helpful. Lately I want to give up on life. I cant do what I want anymore. 

I was recently revictimized and its not the doctors fault because they are doing they're job but for me its a big deal. I saw a specialist because I have bladder issues. They ran a bunch of tests, very uncomfortable ones. After all the tests and after hearing the results is when I told them I was sexually abused as a child and teenager. This opened another area. 

My treatment used to be covered by the Government. I need to get pelvic floor physiotherapy because my pelvic floor is completely messed up. I cant afford it and again I am stuck and left cleaning up the mess of my father in what he did to me. At my last appointment the doctor is sending me to another hospital and specialist for a different treatment for pain and pelvic floor dysfunction just to manage my symptoms. 

I have felt useless. All of this. I am alone. 

I am in a relationship and letting my loved one know things that are going on that has taken me years to tell my counselor is draining. When I react to something and talk about my feelings sometimes its dismissed when I was asked to express my feelings and open up more. It is frustrating. When I am frustrated with it, it somehow becomes about me and its not okay. Sorry? 

I am in a loving accepting relationship and the family is wonderful. My relationship issues are around not understanding my trauma and sometimes I am too ""emotional"" and sometimes its hard to get my thoughts out. All I want to say is, ""imagine what its like inside but add physical pain to it, and sometimes I can see my abusers in my head or their voices."" Its not fault. 

I own up to my mistakes. I have been trying to change and be this super person. I am exhausted. I have been a horrible person. 

I am not used to having people around. I have gotten upset when I come back and ask for a tea to be made and no response and I break down. I never had that ever. I rely on it and I shouldn't. Obviously I have attachment issues. 

I am done fighting. I am done trying to communicate my feelings when something comes up for me and its dismissed, I am trying, I am fed up with my life and I am sick of proving myself and not being believed. I have no idea what to do. 

I feel so low. My soul is sucked from me. I dont know what is wrong with me. It all happened when I never got around filling my Effexor up and went through withdrawal symptoms. I went back on it and felt better. Since I havent felt the same. I was off it for fivr days and it happened two weeks ago.

I dont know what I am looking for or asking. I just am tired of fighting off my PTSD and its exhausting because I dont want to feel the physical pain so I just make myself go numb or step out of my own body to protect myself as I am so used to it and that is what I have been doing for years in order to function and now I am taking time for myself I havent been needing to do that as much.",BetrothSword,2019-02-24 09:27:16,3,873,19.27,7.78,97.79,1,12.65,15.69,92.67,60.71,21.31,15.35,14.78,0,0,0.11,0.46,5.96,3.44,12.49,11.23,4.81,8.93,2.75,20.05,4.47,1.26,2.18,0.8,1.72,6.19,1.03,5.15,0.46,2.41,0.69,5.96,0.57,0,0,0.46,12.03,2.86,2.29,0.92,1.95,2.29,2.29,2.75,0.46,0.57,1.6,4.58,0.69,3.09,0.34,0.34,7.33,1.6,0.8,3.67,1.03,0.57,7.45,11.57,0.11,14.2,1.83,5.84,6.53,2.52,0.46,0.34,0.11,0.11,0.11,0.46,0.34,0,0.11,0,0,10.42,7.67,1.26,0,0,0.11,0,0.11,0.46,0.34,0.46,0

So in October a coworker and I were cleaning a huge piece of machinery when the catwalk broke and he fell 40' to his death right in front of me. I had to run for help and was first on scene where I had to roll him over and tried to help him by clearing his nose and doing chest compressions but I also knew he was already dead. This whole experience has been really hard for me to deal with and I've mostly been off work since it happened. 

I'm doing a lot better now but still struggling. I've found that any mention of CPR is a trigger for me. I never noticed how much it gets mentioned online or in shows or even real life until this happened but damn it's kind of everywhere and it's driving me crazy. I don't have a full on panic attack or anything debilitating but it does cause me a lot of distress to the point where I will exclaim something nonsensical or make distressed noises, twitch, have flashbacks and generally make me feel terrible. I don't know what the best course of action is here. Would taking a CPR class be a totally terrible thing to do or would it maybe help?

audy67,Am I overreacting?,"I'm stupid and don't know how to tag/mark things, so potentially NSFW or triggering content



I've never posted here so I'm pretty anxious about this. But I need to know if I'm overreacting. Basically, when I was 13 I was in a sexually abusive relationship and I developed PTSD from it. I am 19 now. The person who abused me still lives in my hometown. Last year, a girl he had been dating broke up with him, and she told me that he would still talk about wanting me, that kind of thing. I was in the band in high school, and so was he. Anytime I happened to look up, he was staring at me. When I started a job in fast food, I (stupidly, in hindsight) put it on my facebook. He started showing up there the next day. Recently, he sent me a friend request on facebook. I thought I was okay but the past couple of days have been worse than usual. For context, I have nightmares every night and flashbacks every day. So you can imagine that it getting worse has completely derailed everything for me. I'm pretty much just floating around, dissociated, at this point. I have very little memory of the past couple of days. 

I told my boyfriend I didn't want to come home from college for spring break because I knew that if I ran into the guy who abused me, even just saw him like at a store or something, I wouldn't be able to handle it.

Instead of support, I was told that I'm being irrational. He said that I spend too much time thinking about it and that its ""unfeasible"" that I could run into the abuser. Then when I pointed out that every time I come home from college, I see the abuser at some point, my boyfriend said that I shouldn't act like its anything more than an interaction with any other person.

That really set me off. I told him, how can I act like I'm fine when I spend each day and every night involuntarily reliving what happened to me? Then I told him not to talk to me.

I feel like I'm completely overreacting, but my heart hurts so much from this. I feel completely alone, nobody in my life actually knows the pain I feel from what happened to me. I literally can't even say the words ""I was abused"" out loud without having a panic attack or flashback and I feel so pathetic. But I feel like I've done something wrong here. Can I please get some advice as to if I overreacted?",fishonthesun,2019-02-24 15:15:41,6,445,16.46,12.59,96.23,1,15.34,15.06,93.71,60.9,24.94,17.53,14.61,0,0.22,2.7,0,7.42,3.82,13.03,8.76,8.09,7.64,2.02,18.2,3.6,2.7,2.25,0.45,3.15,6.07,1.35,4.72,0.67,2.02,0.9,9.44,0,0.9,0.45,3.15,14.38,2.92,0.9,2.25,3.82,2.02,4.49,3.6,1.12,0.9,1.57,1.35,0.22,0.67,0.22,0.22,4.94,1.8,0.45,1.57,0.45,0.67,7.42,10.56,0.67,14.61,1.57,5.84,7.19,1.35,0.67,0.45,0.67,0,0,0.45,0,0.22,0.22,0,0,15.96,5.84,4.72,0,0,0.67,0,0,0.9,3.15,0.45,0.22

i just one day up and left without saying anything, he went to work and once he was gone i went to a psychiatric hospital and never went back. He finally got sober literally the day when he got home and saw i was gone. Im so frustrated. this wouldve been the week we met 3 years ago, we were so fucking happy. idk if it was all a lie, or he was just too damaged.

aue5py,"I need some help, family member with PTSD","I don't know what to do.  My brother, he has had it rough for the past decade, the short of it is, was in a bad car accident (someone blew a stop sign), one person died, he didn't through luck only.  After that he got PTSD, he lives another state over so I only heard about the months right after, but it was allot of randomly breaking out into screaming and crying in public, or getting extremely furious over random mundane things.

At that point I thought he was working through it, he had a therapist, was doing stuff for it.  I was hearing things were getting better.  But 2? years later, it seems like he is somewhat ok on the day to day, but also has stopped trying for any more.  I visited him for a month and he still routinely completely breaks down, you can tell that small things that irritate him just build up and build up until he just freaks out and screams at the nearest person.  I've tried to have serious talks or help, I've asked if there's anything to help on a day to day like, meditation, just simple breathing exorcises, exc, exc and it always ends up with either ""you dont understand"" ""you cant understand"" ""this is its own animal"".  I even straight up asked ""do you think you can get better?"" and he said ""no"".

I don't want him to be like this for the rest of his life.

I'm so sick of being so fucked up. I went to this cake show with my mom that weve gone to for years- she knows I have PTSD and a slew of other issues but she dosent really understand that my triggers are still triggers when she says/does them.

I have a debilitating fear of touch related to my PTSD. even a tap or brush can send me into a panic attack. 

me and my mom go to this cake show/con every year. it was particularly crowded this year with way more kids ( I HATE little kids because they have no respect for personal space and being around them is almost terrifying bc of that)

my mom kept standing super close and people around is would crowd to look at cakes. I would panic  and scream at people to move and I feel over trying to scramble away from this lady that kept repeaivly shoving her hands in front of ppl to take pictures. id impulsively snap at people or my mom to move. I ended up having a really bad panic attack/flashback and passing out on the floor (I was sitting thankfully) and like 7 people in this class across the hall just gave me weird looks. 

I'm sick of not being able to enjoy things. I'm so fucking sick of it. I'm sick of not being able to go to the fucking grocery store with out crying in the bathroom. I'm sick of missing events I love because of my paranoia. my life is fucking ruined. it's been 4 years since I was diagnosed and I havent improved at all.

auf7m8,My boyfriend wants to end himself because of PTSD.,"Hello, I don't use reddit often, so I'm sorry if I don't respond quickly or if I'm not clear about certain things in my initial post. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend (lets refer to him as ""C"") has been struggling a lot with PTSD. There was a lot of bad events that happened in his past, but it all went downhill after a couple really bad crashes. We're in a long distance relationship, but we visit each other twice every year. I'm not sure how to help C besides by talking to him when he's really stressed out. He tried therapy for a couple months, but he feels stressed during therapy, so he stopped going. He also tried medication, but that made him feel more suicidal than he already is, so he stopped immediately. C usually smokes pot (it's legal in his state) to help him de-stress and he would play video games too. However, almost every week he would tell me about how useless he feels, how he would end himself if I left him, how he wants help, but also feels as though he doesn't deserve it, how he feels like he has no emotions left, and that he feels like he can never be fixed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a couple of the main problems C and I are having: 

1. The problem with where C is living is that he didn't have a good past with his father and his brother is being a dick to him more frequently. Both his father and brother are aware that C has PTSD, but they don't understand that when C tells them that they're stressing C out, they don't stop. Basically, the household that he's living in is stressful for him, but he also says that he feels safer being at home. It's also convenient for C to be in the same house as his brother since they can go to and leave work at the same time. 
2. C used to go to college and he had amazing grades. Heck, he was at the top of most of his classes. However, he stopped going after the incidents. He badly wants to go back to college again, but he feels stressed out when trying to go back. When we discuss topics regarding school, he mentions that he feels like he's too ""dumbed down"" to go back to school and that he's going to have to restart everything. His father also refuses to pay for his tuition. They're don't have any financial issues (that I know of), but his truly believe that C can pay for his own tuition. He could, however he's already paying rent to his father and he's buying most of the groceries in the house. 
   1. I've been telling C that he can't depend on his dad for anything anymore, but his dad is the only person he feels comfortable asking for help. My parents have actually told me that they would be willing to help him out by letting him live with us and helping him get a start at school again. They just want C to ask them and talk to them about it. C's issue with that is that he doesn't feel like he deserves the help and he feels really stressed thinking about asking them for help, even though they said they would be willing.
3. My personal issue(s), that I already stated in the initial paragraph is that C constantly feels useless and that he feels as though he cant be saved. He often talks about all the things that he could be in the future and all of the things that he wants to do in the future, like having a family with me one day. But none of that is going to happen if nothing changes either. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, he told me that he he feels insanely lost and that he really want to end it all because of PTSD. Any advice on the situation and how to help him would be great. If you have any questions I'll answer as best as I can.

augk6j,Please help me. (long),"Okay let me clear this up right out the bat. I have not been diagnosed with PTSD officially. I am still a minor, and I live at home with my parents. They refuse to believe that mental disorders exist and will not permit me to get any kind of mental help because they can't come to terms that their child might not be ""normal.""

When I was very young, I was the victim of voilent sexual assault. It scarred me very bad mentally, and I continue to be abused and harassed by the same person. I have told my parents, but they don't believe me. It really hurts to know that they're not on my side, and it also hurts to know that nobody is here to protect me from him. My abuser is a part of my family, so I can't get away from him either.

Many things have come out of these assaults. I lost my sense of freedom and my feeling of being in control of myself, and my body no longer feels like a home. I was diagnosed by my regular care doctor with anorexia nervosa, because I gave up on caring enough to maintain a proper body weight. I started to treat my body like it was a game, and that it no longer belonged to me. 

I also have quite frequent panic attacks.

These panic attacks effect my everyday life, and they stop me from being able to function normally. I often do not complete in-class assignments because of a very bad panic attack, which makes me unable to focus or move. 

They are often a result of someone commenting something about sex or rape (which is very commonplace, because I'm in high school). I have very graphic flashbacks, because the biggest assualt is always in my mind. I feel like I can't talk or breathe because of certain things that my abuser did during the numerous times when I was being assaulted.

Sometimes, though rare, there has been occasions in the past where I have passed out because of such a bad panic attack.

I hate having panic attacks and I'm so fustrated with myself and my inability to stay calm. I'm about ready to give up because I don't know what to do.

I also feel like even if I was allowed to seek professional help, they couldn't help me. I am deathly scared of any kind of pill or medication. It gets so bad to the point that if I am forced to take a pill, in my state of fleeting panic, I will force myself to vomit to get it out of my system.

I just really don't know what to do, or how to get my parents to believe or understand me. This might be ranting/venting now that I think about it, but if you guys have any thoughts for me, please help.

Also I know I'm just a stupid kid, but I don't know if I'll grow out of this. Even if I do, I just want to be a normal kid again, a happy kid that didn't lose their sense of self or even innocence so long ago.

Again, also I am deeply sorry if this triggers anything for anybody. I think I know how it feels, and I would never wish anything like what happened to me on anybody else, not even my worst enemy.",suicidal_thottie,2019-02-24 19:49:11,4,573,17.5,6.91,94.39,1,17.36,13.79,95.46,63,21.82,15.01,13.09,0,0.17,0.35,1.4,6.81,3.32,13.79,9.95,7.33,8.73,3.32,17.28,4.01,1.92,1.75,0,1.05,8.2,2.09,6.11,1.22,2.79,0.87,6.81,0.7,0.17,0,0.52,17.63,4.19,3.32,1.92,5.24,1.05,5.41,2.09,0.35,0,1.4,3.14,0.7,1.75,0.52,0.7,9.6,1.92,0.7,5.58,1.05,1.4,3.14,13.09,1.05,10.12,1.05,5.41,3.84,0.87,0.35,0.52,0,0,0.17,0.17,0,0,0.17,0,0,14.31,5.58,4.71,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.35,2.62,0.7,0.17

auhelq,Success/Panic A strange man knocked on my door after 8pm tonight and my brain flipped out,"I live alone in a house I recently bought in a nice neighborhood. It’s my first house and I haven’t lived in a nice neighborhood since I lived at home, so my years of ghetto living haven’t suddenly vanished yet. The town I live in, I know one family and they’re not close. So it’s very uncommon for someone to randomly knock on my door because in the ghetto, people don’t do that without a hidden agenda or unless that’s how you’ve set up your place which I very much have not done.

Anyways, around 8pm tonight, some rando knocked on my door asking for a man I don’t know and left without incident, but because I have ptsd involving a man, or really ptsd in general, alarm bells went off and I panicked. I left for a short bit because that was my plan before he knocked, but I started freaking out in the car that he was scoping out my house and saw a female alone with no dog in sight (I have no pets) which is an easy target.

I rushed home and popped an anti anxiety med and had a single rational thought that I have a couple door knobs and deadbolts to put on a couple doors still. So I flung a chair over to the door that comes from the garage and put that bad boy together like a pro which was not the case when I put the front door one on.

By the end of the project, my med had kicked in and suddenly I’m angry at the situation. I’m angry that my brain made this stranger out to be a bad person automatically. I’m angry that, if he was scoping out my house, that he has the audacity to pick mine of all the houses. Like for real, I’m on disability for mental health reasons and can just about afford this place, can finally stop renting, and this fuck is triggering the hell outta me by existing. Then, I get angry that I’m angry. That my doc wants me to get fueled with rage about situations like this, to feel “empowered” and to “take a stand” instead of cowering and being hella submissive.

aujcgd,Drug coma hallucination flashbacks. My brain’s being a dick. NSFW (medical fiasco w/deets). Input is appreciated.,"Wft brain, you aren’t supposed to remember drug coma shit, but jesus, that shit was like a 2 month long acid nightmare, except the pain was real. 

Hallucinations were layered onto reality. I wasn’t being taken to my high school commons, I was going back into the OR.I wasn’t being water boarded, the dr. was just trying (and failing) to get me off the ventilator. I was wasn’t being held hostage and having my body mutilated and  experimented on, I was...well yeah, guess I was lol.

I’m slowly extracting the puzzle pieces and making the connections, but daaaamn, I didn’t think shit would be this intense. And to make shit worse, all my near death hospital shenanigans as a kid are haunting  me in top of that. 

To add even more, the 90’s smooth jazz gets stuck in my head during panic attack time. Wtf 90’s?! Way to further traumatize my childhood with that horrid music. At least that’s a trigger I’ll never face again. 

But yeah, I got slapped with a gory memory this evening. During the epic medical fiasco, they had to keep my sternum cracked open after open heart surgery for 2 days and yes, I most definitely got sepsis. Good times. 

Holy fucking hell though, the memory of the smells, sounds, bodily sensations, and terrified confusion enveloped me as I was falling asleep tonight. I remember trying to move my restrained limbs and I felt my chest tubes tugging and heard my nurse freaking out, telling me not to move, then I’d feel a cool, tingling sensation and pass out for a day or 2.

My dreams were like a bad batch of lsd. In one darkly amusing dream, I was a head in a jar being displayed on one of a circle of barstools bordering the windows of the space needle in seattle. I was placed on display next to the jarred head of that one shitty redneck comedian guy... eh , you know who I’m talking about. Wft is that? What chemical concoction and memories made that shit happen?! Couldn’t I have been placed with headberg or literally any other comedian ever?! Why that?? And why do I wanna vomit all of the sudden? That shit was random thus hilarious and recalling that makes me sick. 

I’m soooo scattered and my memory is shit. I’m scared to fall asleep because the nightmare demon pixies are waiting. I gotta take a clonidine and a clonazapam, and hope for the best.

aun8qm,Unable To Feel Safe or Let Go,"Over four years ago now I was taken advantage of by an older man who blackmailed me into preforming sexual acts and taking explicit photos of myself. Just recently, a couple of months ago, the guy I was dating mentally abused me. He repetitively told me how disgusting I was and if I were to cry or be hurt by his abuse he would just yell at me more saying I needed to forgive him because he forgives me for all my mistakes, and I make a lot more than him. 

The first abuse I suffered never leaves my head and I can never just forget about it for a day, although it doesn’t induce the same amount of anxiety it used to. Although I feel like i was able to get a grasp on the sexual abuse the new hell mental abuse I was trapped in haunts me. I have panic attack and cry myself to sleep because I just can’t forget. 

I’m unable to find peace with myself and when I start falling I start falling fast. The worst part of it all is that I miss him, and I know it isn’t right for me to miss him but I do. I did some reading and realized it’s normal for people in these types of situations to miss their abuser and knowing that makes me feel a bit better but still.  I feel stupid and pathetic.

I don’t know how to live on just knowing all these things have happened to me. I want to find peace.

auntku,I wrote a poem about my trauma,"I am not really good with words but I wanted to share this poem I wrote a year after the event which caused me to have PTSD happened. Here it goes :

&amp;#x200B;

I was in a terrorist attack.  

I was in a terrorist attack.  

It feels like I've been saying it over and over. 

To the journalist that wanted to know what happened,  

To my counselor who helps me getting better, 

To my family that was scared for my life, 

To my friend with whom I share everything, But still, it feels weird saying it. 

Did it really happen? Was I really involved? 

Does not being physically hurt means that I'm not a victim? 

Am I just too sensitive? 

&amp;#x200B;

But I also feel angry saying it. 

Why me? Why us? 

Why at 21 years old should I know what it's like to be afraid to die? 

Why at 21 years old should I be worried that someone shoots me when I'm with my friend? 

Why at 21 years old when I hear fireworks am I brought back to what happened? 

It's not fair. 

No one should be thinking about that sort of thing.

 And I also feel scared.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, it's getting better. I am not perpetually worried that someone will burst out of nowhere and kill everybody. 

But still, I keep scanning, checking everybody's face,  

I know where the nearest spot to hide is,  

I know where I can try to survive,

I was totally doing alright and everything was fine, until some music came on at work. It wasn’t even music I listened to near what happened, it was stuff I got into later on, but for some reason it was a huge trigger and I had a massive panic attack. 

It somehow just reminded me that the person who hurt me isn’t just a name, that he’s a full person and he’s out in the world living life, and it just reoccurred to me that what happened was actually real and not just a nightmare, or a memory, but that it actually happened. It reminded me of that time in my life and that was enough to send my brain down the PTSD rabbit-hole.

I just wanted to talk about it a little, it’s so weird to me that triggers can really be anything and it’s weird what your brain will zero in on as a reminder of what happened.

In the last few tears I experienced 2 sudden deaths of family members in a 3 week span, then had to help care for my mother after she nearly died on the operating table. Combined with an entire childhood of watching grandparents die and dealing with a chronically ill parent, I’ve shut down. One of those deaths was a best friend/basically sister I was codependent on since childhood, and I learned of her passing pretty horrifically and went in to shock. 

My mother said to me the other day that’s like I have no emotions anymore. I don’t trust people. I lose my shit when I get a text just saying “call me” because of how I got notified of one death. I completely lose my sense of reality all the time, sometimes when I’m driving!, and am either stonecold numb or sobbing randomly. 

I have zero motivation and I’m sick of this. I want to let people in but I struggle to tell my coworkers basic details of my life without being terrified. 

I’m just so damn over it. I’m quitting my job as soon as I can because it’s high stress and I’m already too stressed and hyper vigilant.",coronetheart,2019-02-25 20:28:16,4,252,37.53,12.49,96.31,1,18,18.25,92.06,55.16,19.05,15.48,14.68,0,0,0.79,0,3.57,4.76,13.49,8.33,5.95,8.73,1.59,17.86,5.16,2.38,1.19,2.38,2.78,7.94,1.98,5.56,1.59,0.79,1.59,8.33,2.38,0.4,1.98,0.4,11.51,2.78,1.98,0.79,2.78,1.19,2.78,2.38,0.4,0.79,0.4,3.17,0.4,2.78,0,0,8.73,2.78,1.98,2.38,1.59,1.98,4.37,12.3,0.79,13.1,1.19,4.37,7.54,1.98,0.4,0.4,0,0,1.98,0.79,0.79,0,0,0,0,13.49,4.37,2.38,0.4,0,0.79,0.4,0,0.79,3.97,0,0.4

Well enough of talking around the bush, let's get into the actual thing I want to ask.

I myself am not effected by anything PTSD-ish (Well in college I was heavy breathing at night, stressed out and such, but it went away once I turned 22, never happened since even if I tried to force it)

So do know that there has to be some kind of trigger, and that it is different to each and every person individuall.

If I somehow trigger someone, especially someone I know and love, should I just pretend like it was nothing or should I actually... I don't know, help?

But now I'm in a fog and terrified he's going to get the same reminder and try to contact me. I'm happily married now and just want this to stay in the past. Most days in fine but some days it still hurts so bad. Or something little will happen that will remind me of it and I just can't handle it. I'm tired of feeling broken from this period in my life.

av4i4j,Panic attack while dreaming,"A couple years ago I was involved in an incident that left me with pretty bad ptsd &amp; occasional panic attacks (that were mainly in the months following the incident when something reminded me of it. I still occasionally get panic attacks and sometimes they aren’t related to the incident, the last major panic attack I had was probably very recent after the incident.  I was too prideful to admit I needed help/ therapy and lately my anxiety has been getting bad, not even relating to the accident but school, etc. 


Yesterday there was an incident in my college town that resulted in a student death. I didn’t know the student, but several of my friends did from either back home or here at school so I was pretty upset to hear the news. 

Later that night I had a dream that I was at the scene of the incident and although they weren’t really similar incidents, I think it subconsciously reminded me of my incident and I had the worst panic attack I’ve ever had, all while dreaming. It was so vivid. I think I knew I was dreaming but I still could not calm down. I woke up later, not immediately after that and was soaked in sweat. 

It was different than the usual nightmare/ being scared etc. It was like I was reliving my past trauma again for the first time. 

TL; DR - Had a dream of an event that reminded me of past trauma that I never received help for &amp; relived a similar experience leading to a massive panic attack all while dreaming but it felt the exact same as if I was awake. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Does this mean I should seek help/ therapy for unresolved trauma?

avf21u,"My girlfriend has PTSD, I have a temper. I need help navigating issues that come up because of this.","This is long, sorry. TL;DR at end.

I have issues with my temper. Not a crazy issue, but it can get somewhat out of hand sometimes. My anger is normally somewhat justified but my reaction is normally pretty dramatic. I have raised my voice, I have punched a hole in a wall and slammed a couple doors, never would lay my hands on someone though. My girlfriend also has a temper, shes raised her voice, shes punched holes in the wall, slammed doors, smashed things. She would never lay a hand on me either though.

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 5 years now, my girlfriend is diagnosed with PTSD from going to jail (accidentally brought a joint that was hidden on the bottom of her purse across the border from Canada into the US, spent 150 days in a women's jail awaiting trail before getting dismissed and deported home) along with trauma from a past relationship. Her previous boyfriend mentally and physically abused her, once locking her in a bathroom and beating her with a rolled up ball of socks.

Because of some of the trauma my girlfriend has experienced in the past it can make navigating stuff a minefield for me. Sometimes I will say something very innocent and she takes what I say, mixes it up flips it around and makes it into something it's not. She always tries to read between the lines and act like what I'm saying has some coded message in it to hurt her. She says this is because her past boyfriend would always be negative, belittle her and knock her down at every turn. I do not do this. She's acknowledged I do not do this. This causes a lot of fights though and I am not putting the blame on her for this.

When she gets worked up she says her mind goes blank and she can't remember what she said, or what I said. for example, she'll say something to me that hurts or that I don't like, she's joked about our sex life to friends and I really don't like it. I will point out that, she will get defensive and we get in an argument. She will say something out of anger that's hurtful and I will point that out, she is already worked up and denies she said the thing, this sets me off and I get really angry so I tell her to leave my apartment. She will then act like the reason she said the thing that set me off is because I kicked her out of my apartment.

She backtracks and pretends, or somehow confuses my reaction to getting upset and makes it the thing that started the argument. So instead of us talking about how it makes me uncomfortable to joke about our sex life, the argument becomes about me telling her to get out of my apartment. I will often be like, so in your head out of the blue I just told you to leave my apartment with no context? Then she will say she doesn't remember exactly what happened because of PTSD, but for sure my version of events didn't happen even though she can't tell me what has happened. It just feels like we are arguing about not real shit constantly, fabricated situations. I try so so hard to be compassionate to her PTSD but it seems shes conveniently doesn't remember things if she is in the wrong and jumbles up her memories to paint me in an evil light while you can sure as fuck believe if I was in the wrong she would remember everything to the exact detail. We'll be an hour into arguing, I will be like ""please get the fuck out of my face"" and then she will act like me saying get the fuck out of my face is what started the argument and justifies whatever she said even though we we're arguing for an hour before that. It's exhausting.

I get very very angry in these situations sometimes, I yell, I've slammed doors and I've punched two holes in the wall before. My father did this growing up, he was very angry when he was upset and would break stuff and yell but never laid a hand on me, my siblings or my mother and besides that was the most loving and perfect father you could ask for. I picked this up from him I assume and I am not proud. All this shit came to a head recently when we were in a very very big loud over the top argument. I was yelling for her to get out of my apartment and give me space (she has a house). She was refusing to leave, I was screaming over and over to get the fuck out, not proud of this.

She finally goes to walk out the door and I go to slam the door behind her out of anger. Just as I go to slam the door she turns around and tries to come back in the apartment and I smoke her in the face with the door. 100 percent not on purpose, 100 percent all anger just melts away and I just feel like such a huge piece of shit I feel so fucking guilty I just want to die. I just hit the women I love and hurt her, while unintentional it is the closest I have ever came to physically abusing someone and it scared the living shit out of me. I want to control this anger and I don't want to get that close to doing that ever again even though it was unintentional my anger caused her to get hurt and that eats at me.

I have tried therapy and that doesn't do it for me. I don't know what to do here, I don't know how to deal with the frustration of being accused of stuff, arguing things that are not based in actual reality and trying to navigate my SO's PTSD. I'm compassionate to it but sometimes feel like it's a bit of an easy excuse but that's also terrible to even say.

Any advice on how to keep my cool, how to navigate my SO's PTSD, how to be more compassionate and ways to not get so worked up. Any advice at all would be appreciated. I've tried my hardest here to no make this sound one sided and honestly say my downfalls

TL;DR: My GF has PTSD, she says because of this she has a really bad reaction to frustration and anger and shuts down forgetting everything that gets said in an argument, puts words in my mouth and twists situations to make me seem like villain sometimes. I get very very frustrated by this and we get in pretty intense arguments with back and forth yelling. All came to a climax when I hit her with a door by a mistake. Never want this to happen again and want help navigating someone with a mental illness and any advice on keeping my cool in these situations.",notathrowawayawayz,2019-02-27 08:04:51,3,1210,36.71,45.71,46.64,1,23.27,13.97,92.4,61.98,21.24,14.38,8.18,0.91,0.33,4.96,0,6.86,5.45,15.29,8.51,6.2,8.1,2.4,19.09,3.06,1.82,1.49,0.58,1.74,7.52,1.9,5.62,0.41,3.72,0.5,12.23,0.33,0.74,4.79,0.58,12.73,1.9,2.4,1.57,3.14,1.65,3.22,3.97,0.25,2.23,1.4,2.89,1.16,0.91,0.58,0.17,7.52,2.56,1.07,2.15,1.74,0.25,3.8,13.06,1.32,13.72,1.74,8.1,3.97,0.33,0.41,1.4,0.08,0,0.08,0.99,0.74,0.08,0.17,0,0,10.91,4.21,3.31,0.08,0.17,0.08,0,0,0.17,2.56,0.33,0

avg9qj,Do I have a claim to PTSD?,"So I know PTSD is a serious thing, and that people have been through some crazy shit. Therefore, before claiming to be a person with a claim to PTSD, I would like to submit my story to this forum and see what you believe. When I was about 5 years old, my biological Mother had me and my Brother in the car, and she had some type of episode. She claimed she was about to crash the car and kill all 3 of us, and me and my Brother had to beg and cry for her not to do it. We were pretty terrified and thought it was going to happen, and had to cry and reason with her not to do it. Eventually she decided not to do it, and we drove home. (She died of overdose about 9 years later).

I have often felt an extreme level of emotional numbness in my life, and multiple incidents like this seem influential. But is something like that enough of a reason? Obviously encountering military shells and rape are more intense, but I'm just asking the community if I also have a claim to PTSD.

avh08c,Shameful events give me PTSD-like symptoms,"I am 20 now and ever since I was 12 I've been having these PTSD-like symptoms where I would get flashbacks to shameful memories. It's not one particular memory that haunts me. They're basically all memories of a shameful nature that happened in the past few years. It could be where I said something wrong and later thought it to be embarrassing. Or it could be someone who belittled me and made me feel shame. I have a history of childhood bullying and a hard upbringing, and I quickly learned not to react to those events and instead of digesting them in a healthy manner, I would keep them to myself. 

I get these flashbacks multiple times a day, where I have to roar or smash the wall with my fist(poor neighbors). It makes meditation uneasy for me as they come up during my sessions too. I've tried to observe them as merely thoughts, but the feelings of shame that are associated with these thoughts are simply unbearable. It's funny how my mind is racing, but it's mostly the same thoughts that I think. I'm also quite uneasy to be around as I often come off as insecure and needy. I also keep myself busy with media all day long and can't be productive at all. I also look and feel older than I really am.

avinw4,how do you deal and cope with flashbacks without resorting to anger and suicidal thinking? (Possible Triggers),"so i have put this NSFW as i want to be open as possible. i have been battling with a flashback for years, which all happened in response to a relatively mild event that the rest of society wouldn't be affected by. 

i used to get repetitive stuck images about the event in my head and obsess, which would lead to feeling extremely detached from myself and a sense of brain fog, the residual impacts after the episode had extreme effects on my mood generally causing severe anhedonia and hopelessness, as well as irritability, self aimed wraths, and even suicidal ideation. 

i saw a psychiatrist and didn't really talk about this event but did talk about other traits, i was diagnosed with OCD and GAD, and cluster b traits. my GP prescribed Zoloft which worked great in addition to seroquel, i stopped seroquel due to weight gain but even after stopping the seroquel, Zoloft was well enough to control the flashbacks alone and these episodes would happen every few months generally. 

&amp;#x200B;

i no longer get images of said event but instead it manifests itself as a change in aura, a sense of atmospheric change. i feel as if somehow i am reliving said event, or in other words reliving the same psychological effects that i had during the event. i don't feel scared or anything in these episodes, i just feel this sense of ''brain fog'' and a sense of being cut of from myself, it's an extremely depressing feeling, and i convince myself that the present is all that exists but it does not change anything. i've had this all night tonight, what can i do? how do i snap out of this when i feel a flashback coming? is there way to electrically shock your brain everytime a flashback happens, could ECT help this?

When i was nine... my mom decided to divorce from my dad... in most cases it wouldn’t be too bad... in this case it was different... this entire shit storm caused my diagnosed PTSD. I faced my dad getting destroyed by my mom in every way possible... from my dad having to sleep in his car to my mom who aways said my dad was a demon... from the most horrible things you could imagine... my mom wrote a letter to her lawyer stating that my dad “beat us” “Physically abused us” and “mentally abused us” my mom is delusional, She has mental health issues...  Because of this she only sees her own reality instead of the actual reality... now skipping ahead... when i was 12 my mom kicked me out of her house because her new boyfriend who moved in with us almost immediately hated kids... He played her in such a way that my mom started hating us. A couple of weeks later when i moved in with my dad.. My sister still lived at my mom’s. my sister had enough of being isolated from the people and family she had been with her entire life.. so she said “mom i wan’t to go to dad to see my brothers...” my mom took this as a sign of her wanted to move into with my dad’s as well... when they dropped her off there was a giant hassle between my dad and my mom’s boyfriend... her boyfriend pulled out a pickaxe (i know right what the fuck) and threatened my dad. I proceed to calling the police and they show up... we got Youth counseling at the end but that didn’t work as planned... they damage had been dealt and still to this day me and my mom are rivals.. she’s a delusional alcoholic who lost her mind.

avlbeq,Any advice on revisiting my trauma from 5 years ago to grief properly?,"About 5 years ago when I was 16 my grandpa committed suicide and a few weeks later my dad passed away. At this time I was so low I was unable to show my face at school because the first day I went back all eyes were on me and the abnormal attention was too much, along with many other things I’d rather not discuss. Kids are mean. At this time we decided home bound was the option for me. In order to be home bound because of “mental illness,” it was required to be seen by psychologist and psychiatrist consistently on a weekly basis. That’s where I was prescribed all of the different anxiety/depression medications you can think of. I feel as though this time period of my brain constantly being fogged by medication stripped me of my ability to properly grieve. Fast forward to now and I feel as though I have a strong unbalance within me. There’s no doubt in my mind that I need to revisit this time in my life and grief properly for the sake of my sanity. Does anyone have advice on how I should begin to reface the part of my life that gives me suffering and sorrow every day? For some reason I feel like maybe going somewhere beautiful to write my feelings down could be helpful. Therapy isn’t an option for me anymore. While I support it and have seen it work wonders for my loved ones, my experience of therapy hasn’t been helpful for me. I’m an introverted soul that feels like this is something I need to face on my own. Was just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience on revisiting grief that could give me words of advice or encouragement?

avld7t,I was diagnosed yesterday,"Yesterday, my medical doctor officially diagnosed me with PTSD.
I have been seeing the same physical for 11 years, and my ex saw him too.

The doctor has treated us individually, and he knew that my ex had mental issues, but I never opened up about the physical abuse until after I had the courage to leave him.

It’s been 4 years.
Not getting any easier.
I get triggered so easily, and if I’m out in public, that fight or flight instinct kicks in, and I RUN.

I must say it was such a relief for my doctor to say “I can’t believe we didn’t diagnose you until just now. After everything you have been through with this man, of course you have PTSD”

Instead of me just feeling like I was crazy, or had no reason to be anxious or have a full blown panic attack, now I’m so happy that there really is something.

After being verbally, physically, emotionally, sexually, financially abused for all these years, I guess I couldn’t keep the mask on, and I cracked.

Next step is seeing a psychiatrist.

avn0q1,Scared of touch,"Lately my PTSD has gotten a lot worse. It's to the point now where any kind of touch, even accidental, is terrifying for me. Usually only when it comes from my boyfriend though. I have been retriggered by being sexual with him because we were both in bad states of mind when we did so. Plus we've been arguing a lot so it's been terrifying to even try and trust him. My therapist thinks I was forcing myself into sexual or intimate situations because of my ex or in spite of my PTSD which in turn retriggered me and made me trust my boyfriend less. This has made it hard recently to understand when I *want* to do things. And not like normal questioning but rather obsessive. Like, ""do I want to be touched"" turns into ""I think I want to be touched, but I'm not sure, what if I dont, what if I'm just forcing myself,..."" which devolving into ""i think I want to play a video games with him, but am I sure, am i forcing myself to, do i want to, is he forcing me to,..."" and it just keeps spiraling.

avni17,DAE feel uncomfortable with people of the same ethnicity as your abuser(s)?,"*mentions of CSA*

I am by no means a racist or prejudiced individual.  

However, my father, who is Ecuadorian, sexually abused me for years. The earliest encounter I could recall is before age five. It continued until I was twelve years old. 

To this day, I tell people I am solely of Colombian origin (identifying with my mother’s home country) and will flat out deny that I am from anywhere else.  Most people say I look more Puerto Rican, but on the rare occasion people say I look Ecuadorian, I feel deep rage and anger inside. I will get upset if people suggest Ecuadorian when they’re taking a guess at my ethnicity. Only one of my friends knows I’m Ecuadorian, and that’s because she’s known me for years. No one else in my circle knows. Everyone just thinks I am a Colombian-American. 

I feel uncomfortable around Ecuadorian men. Since I was not abused by women, they do not invoke the same sense of fear as men do. 

I have only dated and been intimate with black guys. I feel a sense of relief that when I’m with them, we look different physically. I cannot date a Hispanic man because our skin tones will look similar, and when we are intimate, it will remind me of my father. I don’t expect anyone to understand my logic behind this. I am not prejudiced or biased towards Hispanic men, but my father’s abuse has deeply affected many of the ways I look at life. If a Hispanic man shows romantic or sexual interest in me, I feel repulsed and disgusted. I feel like I have to take several hot, scalding showers. I will only seek out the attention of black men. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Has anyone felt strange around people who either resemble your abusers but have nothing to do with the abuse or feel resentment against the gender and ethnicity of individuals who resemble your abuser?",pricklypointycacti,2019-02-27 21:45:30,0,342,43.06,33.05,95.65,1,14.87,18.13,89.77,52.92,17.54,13.45,10.82,0.88,0.88,0.29,0.58,4.09,4.39,12.57,9.94,3.22,7.31,2.34,18.13,5.26,3.8,1.75,1.17,1.46,6.14,0.88,5.26,1.17,3.51,0,12.87,1.17,0.88,0.88,2.92,16.08,5.85,1.46,1.17,3.51,0.58,5.85,7.02,2.63,0.58,2.92,1.46,0.29,0.58,0.58,0,2.92,1.46,0,0.58,0.88,0,2.05,14.04,1.75,10.23,0,4.97,4.97,0,0,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.2,5.85,4.09,0,0,0.88,0,0.29,0,2.34,1.17,0.58

avp06j,How do I deal with new doctors?,"Hi, 

I got a diagnosis of Complex PTSD last year, after 8 years of having my disorder misdiagnosed. I’ve since moved 2.5 hours away from the doctor/psychiatrist who was able to diagnose me (they’re only Monday to Friday, I’m a teacher), and I’m trying to find a new doctor. 

The main issue is I’ve found two who have either not believed I have PTSD because “You’re young, and nothing that bad happened.” Or asked me “What happened to you to make you this way? Why do you have PTSD?” It’s really upsetting and I don’t want to relive the past again.

I’m also overweight and the medication I’m on (lexapro, 40 mg, trying to see if it will continue working) causes weight gain. I eat (mostly) well and I exercise often and log this. One of the doctors has tried to take me off of the medication so I could lose weight, while the other has tried suggesting I was lying about my calories and suggesting a Keto diet so that I could lose weight and that I might have diabetes (he didn’t listen to me when I said I’ve already had the assessment and I don’t have diabetes). 

How do you guys usually find doctors who are decent? I’m in Country Australia and it was oddly easier in a town of 1200 people. I just want a doctor that believes me and is willing to listen around my medication and concerns. I really want to fight this and if I can find a doctor who’s willing to read my case notes and go from those suggestions that would be excellent.

Also, how do you deal when this happens? Both times have ended in a panic attack.",Laurensics,2019-02-28 01:03:11,2,295,13.16,29.37,78.64,9.22,18.44,13.9,91.19,59.66,19.66,13.22,10.85,0,2.03,0.34,0,6.44,5.42,10.17,13.9,7.46,9.49,1.69,25.08,3.73,1.02,3.73,2.03,0.68,4.75,1.36,2.71,0.68,1.02,0.68,8.14,0,0.34,0,0.68,13.22,3.05,2.71,2.71,3.05,0.34,3.05,2.37,0.34,1.02,1.02,7.12,0,5.76,0,2.03,8.47,0.34,3.39,3.05,1.69,1.02,6.1,16.61,0.68,11.86,0.68,3.73,7.46,3.73,0.34,0,0,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,0.34,0,17.97,3.73,3.05,0,0,1.69,0,0,1.36,5.08,2.71,0.34

avrif2,"I’ve had PTSD for almost 6 years, I know for some that’s not long to some, but in the past 6-8 months I started to get flashbacks.","Yea so, after an assault, that happened by someone that faked our friendship, I had a the normal amount of waking up from nightmares and during a day out, from time to time, when I saw a man that resembled him, it was horrifying to say the least. About a year later I was walking around the mall with a friend and I saw him and told my friend, “ that guy walking towards our direction, he’s the guy that assaulted me..” she just held my hand and made me feel a lot better. I felt so lucky to have her do that. At that time, she was one of the only real friends I had so it meant so much. 

Anyway, about a year later than that, so it had been two years later at that point, it just stopped, I didn’t shove it done, I accepted that I survived it and I know even to this day, that if it haunts me, it’s still not as bad as the act itself, I live with it and I know trauma sticks with ya. 

It came back when I was 19, throughout the day I would uh, kinda see in my head him raping me, or random people getting assaulted, and sometimes it was children, I think bc my love for kids ( in a very non predatory way. ) i have a nurturing instinct so I think that’s part of why it is shown. I’ve always considered that to be one of the worst crimes. I could hear the people screaming sometimes and I’m not schizophrenic, it’s just something that I’m wondering if it happens to others?

Now I’m about to be 22, and I see my own assault mostly, thank god it’s rarely random people... but I will start shaking, I know it’s not happening again is what I tell myself in my head, but at the same time, it’s hurting me bc it feels like it is happening again, I’m just aware it isn’t. I can’t move when this happens. 

Sex is something that I have to stop in the middle of more and more often. I found out what my triggers are with the help of my bf, I’m very lucky that he understands. 

I’m sorry this was a bit of a long post, I’m just wondering if people have had the experiences of seeing other people in their head, assaulted and or themselves. It sickens me, really.
That’s by far the worse thing when it does happen from time to time, I’m just lucky it’s not everyday anymore. 

I’ve been to every kind of therapy you can think of, even about a year before the incident happened. It’s not worked after seeing around 5 therapists, but does anyone know if hypnotherapy is real? I mean I know there has to be fakes, but I’ve never actually been walked through it while laying down or anything.

The level with which she consciously fucked with my head has left me still wondering what even happened, and its been over a year since I last talked to her.

When I was with her I didnt live in the real world. I lived in her world. It was a fever dream where nothing made sense and everything was slimy and dysphoric. Up was down. Tears and self harm were expressions of love.

Im not going to say Im a victim because I chose to live in that world, and more importantly, victimhood is her manipulative game and not mine. All I want to say is that spending the last several months figuring out what is real and what is narcissistic fantasy has been the most painful thing Ive ever done.

avrtzd,Trauma and relationship guidance,"I am in a relationship and I am having a difficult time with a few things because of my trauma. I am not sure if anyone has any guidance or advice on any of it or if you relate, anything is helpful. 

1) I am not showing respect towards my partner. He has expressed I don't respect him and I feel I do but maybe I don't but I can't see it. Is this common in PTSD people particularly in childhood sexual abuse survivors? How do I respect my partner more? 

2) When we are talking about our relationship and he is telling me things, I sometimes black out or forget because I feel its to much emotional strain or something happening. He always says we come back to the same conversation again and again where I forgotten that he talked to me about it. Does this happen to others? 

I find it happens when we are arguing and things are intense and inside my past comes up for whatever reason which I don't say anything. More like, I act this way because of X thing happened to me. Which I don't tell him. 

3) He wants me to share what's going on for me and my feelings. Before I had a hard time doing that. I worked on it and started to let him in more. I am finding I go to him to tell him at the wrong times and I don't always ask him if I can talk to him or tell him something, but I do. How do I balance letting him in and him not becoming frustrated over me ""dropping my feelings on him"" per say? 

I get mixed messages of ""what's bothering you, you can tell me."" To ""I want you to come to me when you feel like talking or something's bothering you."" To ""I'm to emotional""

I am not saying he is at fault, I am also at fault. I would like to know what I can do so next time I am better equipped to handle these things. My past trauma really did a number on me and I am trying to figure it out and I feel so alone.

avus3y,I want to go to the police but I feel guilt and fear.,"My brother molested me from the ages of 6 to 12, he was 13 to 19. I told my parents when I was 17 because I’d finally had enough of the secret. My form of dealing with my circumstances was over idolizing my brother, I separated him into “big brother” and “abused” like he was two people. Now as an adult I realize he was always just an abuser. His friend nearly raped me and he laughed it off. His buddies stayed at my parents house and his wife told me they said disgusting things about me and my brother never even said a word. When we’d go out to the bar together he’d spend the whole night talking about sex, he even would tell me my childhood best friend sent him dirty messages (which I doubt). 

My parents believed me for about 12 hours, then after speaking with him a switch flipped and they began ignoring me. I left that summer. I’ve confronted them on it last year. I called them out and told them every time they ever failed me, they acknowledged their failure but have refused to change and now our relationship is very distant. Which I’m okay with.

Last year I also outted my brother on Facebook. I had a handful of family and friends who supported me but most of my family ignore it entirely and haven’t spoken to me since. According to the statue of limitations once I turn 26 I won’t be able to file
Criminal charges against him and I thought that I could be okay with that but I’m struggling.

I want him to held accountable by SOMEONE. I want someone to say “yes what happened was wrong and he will pay the price” but I’m terrified of walking into a police department to say “yes 10 years ago I was molested” it feels stupid, it feels like I’m being dramatic. But honestly I feel like I’ll never be able to let it go until he is held accountable by someone. 

I just have no idea what the process is gonna be like or what to expect and it scares me. The unknown of if he’d even be found guilty scares me. Because what if he gets away with it entirely..... I’m afraid it would set my journey of healing back so far.",im-opinionated,2019-02-28 11:01:17,10,405,21.8,50.99,75.74,1,17.61,15.56,94.32,60,25.43,19.75,12.84,0.49,0,4.44,1.98,5.68,3.7,13.33,9.38,5.19,7.65,1.23,20,3.46,1.98,2.22,2.47,1.23,7.16,1.73,5.43,2.22,1.23,0.49,16.79,2.72,0.99,0.25,5.68,11.85,2.72,0.99,2.22,2.47,1.73,2.96,2.96,0,1.73,1.23,0.99,0,0.25,0.49,0.25,9.14,5.19,1.48,2.47,0.49,0.99,6.67,9.63,1.48,13.33,2.47,4.44,6.91,1.48,1.23,0.74,1.23,0,0,1.23,0,0.25,0.99,0,0,13.83,6.67,1.48,0,0,0,0,0,1.98,3.21,0.49,0

I’ve been seeing the same therapist for over two years and she is easily the best therapist I’ve ever had, the first I’ve felt comfortable sharing many difficult things with. We connected so well and she’s never indicated any problems with me. I missed two of our weekly sessions in January and haven’t been back since. I called in to schedule and the receptionist said she would get back to me and never did. I emailed my therapist and she asked when I was available, I responded, and then never heard back from her. I’ve emailed her again since then, still nothing. 

I honestly feel crushed. I trust this woman, more than just about anyone else. I’ve told her things I have never been able to say to anyone. I was invested in this process. I don’t want to start over with someone new. Am I really that horrible? Does she just not want to have to be around me anymore? I’m definitely not “all better” and ready to ease out of therapy. It’s stupid, but it feels like I’ve been dumped and I don’t even know why. I don’t even know if I can handle opening up like that again, especially if this is going to be the result.

avvgmx,Feeling Completely Stuck (Trigger Warning ),"So I've been living in a community for a year, and three months ago, an old, married man began making very inappropriate advances towards me. I told my therapist at the time and even though my alarm bells were ringing hard, she told me to confront him on my own. Well, his subversive behavior has only continued and I feel totally let down by my therapist. Now I have told some members of the community, which was really hard to do, but the other issue I have is that, on top of having to go through an external process to address the behavior, I am also feeling now completely triggered all the time, since the last incident. I waa groomed into an abusive relationship beginning age 17, and the methods used were completely the same as how this current guy has been trying. They even used the exact same sentence. The only difference between then and now is that I was silent then, and I have spoken out now. It is quite a major difference. However, I know that even with the actions I am taking, I will continue to see the guy on a regular basis because I live in the same very small community with him. Therefore, even once he has the warning that I will go to the police with the next inciden, I will still feel triggered every time I see him. The first guy destroyed my life. And it will never be the same again. I now hsve  major ptsd and chronic health problems. What I'm dealing with now, besides being stressful in its own right, is also dredging all that up. I don't know if anything can help, but I wanted to express how I'm feeling.",colourfulsoul369,2019-02-28 12:01:32,0,297,35.2,29.49,92.47,3.4,18.56,19.87,93.94,60.27,16.16,11.78,9.43,0,0,2.02,0.34,4.38,8.42,10.77,10.77,10.44,7.41,0.67,19.19,4.38,2.69,1.35,1.35,1.35,3.03,0.34,2.69,0.67,1.01,0,7.74,0.34,1.01,0.34,3.03,14.81,2.36,4.04,1.35,1.68,3.03,3.03,4.04,0.67,1.01,2.36,2.69,0,2.36,0,0.34,7.74,2.36,1.35,3.03,0.67,1.35,5.39,12.12,2.02,18.18,2.02,5.39,10.77,0.34,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,0.34,0,0,0,0.34,0,13.47,5.05,6.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.35,0.67,0
avvm3a,Need help explaining symptoms to loved ones and employers.,"I often run into an issue where people think my anxieties and triggers are much more controllable for me than they actually are. For instance, winter weather and rain are a trigger for me, so is interstate driving, and when those things combine, I cannot handle and I just want to stay home and stay safe but others tend to make light of that and just tell me to calm down and everything is going to be fine. I drive 1 hour to work everyday and if the weather is not very good and I am not able to work from home, I am very stiff and tense the whole drive, I am freaking out the entire drive, and I am utterly exhausted by the time I reach the office. Additionally I can't focus, because I instantly start dreading the drive home, frantically checking the weather every 20 minutes or so, get angry that I can't just be normal, and fried from all the anxiety. How do I explain this and other issues in a way where people realize these are not things I am fully in control of (yet) and that my fear and anxiety, while albeit unnecessary at times, are VERY real to me and VERY hard to overcome?

avvr73,Well that sucks.,"So I got an email from my therapist saying she's closing her practice in April, and she wanted to give her clients enough time to come in and ""process"" what that means to them. I've been going to this person for almost 2 years, on and off. She's been a good therapist, and I think I've made some progress. 

So I sent her an email back wishing her good luck in the future, because, really, I didn't want to go back. I just didn't see the point.

So then she sends me another email inviting me in for a free session to, again, process this, and that ""trust me it will make you feel better""  

Like huh? No, it won't. It's almost like she's feeling guilty about it and she wanted to explain or something. I'm not about to go in and cry about the fact that she's got other shit to do in her life besides hold my hand, and it's just putting off the inevitable. I mean, what's the point? I'm pretty used to people fucking with me, or ghosting me or whatever, so it's like it's a new thing. 

So I said no thanks, I've already moved on, and good luck.

avwmnh,I am triggered majority of the time and I can't escape it....,"My ex is THE trigger. I can't escape the bastard because I had kids with him years ago. Any kind of contact I have with him is a trigger. I'm not even kidding, every single time I even get a text I get dizzy, tunnel vision, chest pains, upset stomach, difficulty breathing, thoughts spin out of control, and I go into full panic mode and it will last for the remainder of the day. It happens instantly and I don't know how to manage it at all. These panic attacks have taken over my fucking life.

My ex insists that he is in contact with me on a damn near daily basis. It doesn't matter what I do or say to him for him to stop, he simply refuses listen. He will text first thing in the morning, while I'm at work, at the end of the day, he doesn't give a fuck. He demands that we ""co-parent"" regardless how I am affected by the constant contact. I honestly can't do it guys. He enjoys his ability to control me still and is obviously still emotionally abusing me 8 FUCKING YEARS LATER. We went to a mediator recently where he told her I am a narcissistic mother and it's just what he has to deal with. He read the report for the first time yesterday and proceeded to call me a narcissistic liar first thing this morning so I know that I will continuously be called that by him now. He also loves to constantly throw in ""well we will just have to talk to the judge about it now, wont we?""

I know that the only way I will be able to manage these emotions is by blocking his number completely, but I can't do that yet. I was able to manage my damn symptoms/triggers for years but now its completely unmanageable. My PTSD is back and it's worse than I remember the first time. The first time around I mainly reacted with depressive episodes, but this is full blown anxiety/panic attacks that lasts until I can sleep. Well, I can't sleep. I can't do my job. I can't find energy to clean my house. All I want to do is stay home all day. I've gained SO MUCH fucking weight. I'm in contact with a local domestic violence organization and have asked for their help in advocating for me in court (I do have a lawyer already) and I am on a wait-list for counseling.

Does anyone have any tips for me on how to navigate these symptoms and feelings?

avxeke,[[Trigger Warning]] False/Repressed Memories &amp; my Memories/PTSD//Freaking the HECK out,"I have been hesitant to post this here, as I know how sensitive of a topic it can be. Yet, for a long time it has bothered me, and much more recently so. I didn't know where else to process this, as talking for me is very very hard, in comparison to writing or drawing. Anybody else's experiences, research, resources, etc., would be greatly appreciated, as I feel like I am losing my god damn mind.

&amp;#x200B;

To begin, I know that I am prone to repressing traumatic memories. I was skeptical about them in high school when the below happened (I have always found the human mind fascinating and followed psychopathology/research), but the below experience is literally the only reason I believe in memory repression/trauma based delayed recall.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I know that in high school, I was sexually assaulted by two ex-partners (let's call them J &amp; L), at once. Upon returning home that night I didn't remember much, but a few weeks later, I was speaking to one of J's ex's, whom had mentioned that he tried to take advantage of her, and that I should be careful. It felt as though flood gates had opened (I lost my shit for a few weeks straight, because the emotional response was just so strong). Upon hearing this, I freaked out, and instinctively grabbed my journal (which in high school, i religiously wrote in almost every night). I opened it to the date that I hung out with my two ex's, and sure enough, there was a very long account of what had just happened. Up until speaking to J's ex, I didn't remember a single second of it, nor did I carry any related emotion. It was almost as though my brain had stored it, for later use/recall.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I am beginning to think a lot about my childhood, I am having the same experience. A number of my ex partners have suggested that I was abused as a child, merely due to my emotional experiences when I became sexally active, or neglected to (I started being intimate a lot later than a majority of my peers due to panic attack inducing fears, and genital pain that has never been diagnosed//cured). Thankfully now I am with the most supportive, kind, committed man and I am eternally grateful that he has stuck with me throughout all of this insanity, over the last few years. It's just been incredibly terrifying, and confusing, as it feels as though having a ""childish"" side of my personality has morphed into a low-key case of DID recently with all of the stress of adulthood. Thinking about my childhood, I am beginning to remember how my father would cuddle me at night, if I was nauseous or tired. He would usually cuddle me in a bathrobe, spooning me. I don't recall the cut off age, but I was definitely on the verge of becoming a teenager during the last memory. My household was already one with emotional and occasionally physical abuse, and my mother began to accuse my father of sexually taking advantage of me. As a child, I didn't understand her claims, but recently, they have really begun to bother me. It was always odd to me that my father and mother were so rarely physically affectionate, but during those nights, he would cuddle right up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my memory was basically non-existent - with exceptions of trauma/abuse/things similar - until about age 14 or 15. I have very very very few memories of my childhood that are positive. Some of the things that remind me of my childhood or my father still make me want to retech, and I still have this persistent fear/physical pain reaction to sex sometimes. I am fearful of bringing it up, because while I remember my mother making those accusations, anything else that I remember past that is cloudy at best, and I feel absolutely terrified that maybe I dreamed these things, and that my memory was altered to make me think that these things never happened. For a long time, I felt that way about 

&amp;#x200B;

Working in mental health and having been a patient myself, I am very drawn to research. According to research, DID may not exist (obviously there are politics here) and there are accusations of malingering. I don't have a opinion yet, especially due to my personal experiences. It just really hurt to read that, as the last episode I had, my (now ex-friends) accused me of lying, and recounted the research I just mentioned above. They acted as though I was making shit up, because I pretended to be asleep when I was regressed in a child like state, and giggled when I got out of seeing a ""big scary doctor"". Doctors and hospitals were a form of punishment for me as a child, not just a place to go where I was sick. So. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's also especially confusing, because after the fact, and sometimes even during, my experience is not one of total amnesia. I am sometimes able to see what's around me and experience my surroundings, but it feels as though a more childish, as though I am watching somebody else's life, behind my own eyes instead of on a television screen; no matter how loud I scream it doesn't do anything about what I see or experience in front of me.

&amp;#x200B;

Especially since the only therapy i've had has been 8/9 sessions of DBT (fuck the fact that nobody wanted to address my trauma because of my BPD diagnosis), six weeks of IOP eating disorder treatment (aka, reality checking our bodies, anxiety management, and maybe some light CBT), and now i'm starting to talk to my therapist about EMDR. So it's not as though I've talked about these things in depth, if ever really at all, and have had the chance to implant false memories. I don't know, I just don't fucking know and I feel like i am losing my fucking mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry that this is rather disorganized, just any experience, etc. would be GREATLY appreciated. I am not looking for people to discount memory repression or argue the existence of DID - but instead people whom have been in the same place as me, and found a way out, or at least a place of peace.",waystosaygoodbye33,2019-02-28 15:07:49,0,1097,35.71,11.98,94.22,1,25.51,18.69,90.34,56.88,17.41,11.49,10.39,0.18,0,0.55,0.36,5.93,4.65,13.86,9.66,7.75,8.02,1.73,16.13,6.11,3.28,1.37,1.19,2.1,6.75,1.55,4.92,1.46,1.46,0.64,5.01,0.64,0.36,0.46,0.82,15.22,4.47,1.82,1.09,3.37,1.91,4.01,3.1,0.73,0.46,1.09,2.92,0.64,1.64,0.64,0.09,4.92,0.73,0.91,2.73,0.64,0.46,5.83,8.02,0.09,13.22,0.36,6.02,6.75,1.64,0.27,0.46,0.18,0.18,0,1.28,0.82,0,0.09,0,0,21.06,3.92,7.38,0,1.73,0,0,0.64,0.36,2.19,1.64,3.19
avzcm4,aggressive and paranoid,"I noticed that my symptoms were creeping up the last few weeks.  I had more hyperarousal type stuff, I had more uncontrollable memories, intrusive thoughts....  but I didn't put it together until tonight that probably that is also why I started feeling like everyone was out to get me.  I became paranoid and aggressive at work.  Everything is okay, but I feel bad for being like that with my coworkers, who are nice.  I could apologize, but I don't think this is as big a deal to them as it is to me- I think I came more off as crabby than horrible.  I could let it blow over instead of being like ""sorry I was a jerk, it's because of my horrible backstory and also when you turn the ceiling fan on it causes me to have flashbacks"".  Probably letting it go instead of drawing attention to it is the smart move.

aw2s7k,Progress,"Last night I realized that I have a fear of being alone that's been ingrained in me from childhood traumas. As I grew and the traumas continued to pile on, I lost me. I got used to adjusting who I was depending on what situation I was in. That deepened my fear of being alone. If there was no one around for me to adapt to, I didn't know who to be. I think I've known this, but I've never been able to see it clearly until now. 

Today I wrote down some smaller goals and some bigger goals. I need to be ok with being alone. I need to explore more and get to know me better. I think I'm starting to like me. I know understanding and seeing the patterns is just one part, actually taking what I've learned and putting it to use in my day to day is a completely different battle. A hard battle. But I feel proud of myself today and a little more at peace. One more part of the puzzle is in place. 

I'm very grateful to everyone that shares their stories here. This community has helped me alot in a short amount of time.

aw2zme,"[F, 22] Delayed onset PTSD due to possible past sexual assault experiences. I'm confused. Please help.","These are my past experiences which I think is and is close to sexual assault:

● I was in my teens (high school) when this happened. I was in the living room with my mom, dad, and sister. We were hanging out when suddenly my dad decided he wanted to touch my genital. I moved away because I felt uncomfortable, but he kept on reaching for it and he was eventually able to touch it. I felt violated, but they were laughing, including my mom so I dismissed the feeling. Please, don't misunderstand. My father is a bit emotionally and mentally abusive, but he never tried to abuse me sexually except for instances like I mentioned.

● This happened when I was in college. It was late and there were no seats left, so I had no choice but to stand up in the bus so I could go home. I felt something hard on my rear, which I didn't quite pay attention to due to the bus being so crowded. I thought it was a belt or a bag, but then my friend (who was standing as well) suddenly pulled me closer to her and told me the guy behind me was rubbing his crotch on my back. The shocking thing is I laughed because I thought it was funny. When I arrived home, that's when I realized that what happened wasn't normal. I suddenly felt cold and mad at myself for reacting that way.

● I was still in college and these happened while I was in a relationship with my now ex-boyfriend. He had quite a few exes, but he was my first so I relied on him about relationship matters because I admit I was still quite naive. I also told him about the things I mentioned above. Before we did anything sexual, I already told him I will only allow us to go 'til second base and he agreed.

When we had our first intimate encounter, he was really respectful of my boundaries. But as time went by, he became really pushy. He would force to undress me when I don't want to. I have self-esteem issues and I want to open up to him little by little, but he doesn't seem to care about my discomfort and only cares about his own pleasure.

He also kept on convincing me to give him a blowjob. I told him I don't want to do it, but he just didn't stop on convincing me until I finally gave in. Our entire relationship almost revolved around me giving him blowjobs everytime we meet since then. I felt like he was treating me like an object, so I told him I really wanted to spend quality time with him (sitting in the couch and watching movies, talking about random things, getting to know each other more, stuff like that). He often agreed, but it always led to something sexual.

There was also a time when we were making out and he tried to finger me. I didn't want him to do it so I held his hand in order to stop him, but he kept on pushing my hand away. He eventually did what he wanted to do. I complained about it being painful, but he kept on doing it so I just let him because I felt like even if I refused, it won't matter anyway.

He also tried to give me oral sex. I'm not comfortable with it, so I refused. I said no twice and held his hand, but he kept on lowering my jeans. I wanted to cry, but I stopped myself because we were at his room and his parents were at the living room so I don't want to make a scene because it would be so embarrassing if they found out what we were doing. When I felt his lips on my genital, I felt cold. I froze. He still kept on touching and kissing me, but I never felt any pleasure from it. It's like I was there but I wasn't. I could remember giving him a blowjob and me hitting my head on the wall and almost gagging because he was being too rough. I also heard him say something like, ""I would've cum into your mouth, but I felt pity on you."" with a smug look on his face. I think this is because we agreed that he wouldn't cum in my mouth because I don't want to. I just felt numb the rest of the day while I was with him. When I arrived home, that's when it sank in. I told him through text that I felt disrespected, and he said sorry. He told me he just got carried away and he won't do it again. But after that event, there were times when he'd try to touch me and I'd push his hand away but like what he did before, he'd disregard my refusal.

There were a lot of times when I was aroused by what he was doing even if I don't want it. And I feel like it's my fault because I let him get his way when I could've fought and resisted more. I could've set my boundaries clearer. I'm really confused. I feel light-headed. I want to go into details more but this is already too long. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to feel.

The doctor was mandated reporter, but still the cops asked me if I liked it rough, if I orgasmed, they asked if I said no and in response to “It was hard to talk he was choking me” they said “well he must not have heard you.” It was so terrifying what happened. For the first time I experienced real death anxiety because I thought I was going to suffocate to death. There was tearing from anal rape, which is what the doctor reported. I’m having a bad time bc someone told me if he were falsely accused of rape he’d rape her so at least he got something out of it. I’m angry.

aw87t1,Experiences finding a counsellor/therapist,"Hi r/PTSD. I am new to this thread and wanted to share a recent experience and ask for your support. 

I experienced a significant trauma 2 years ago which involved a health care provider. I was left physically damaged and required surgical repair. Since then, I have suffered from psychological symptoms, which have been debilitating at times. I have sought support from counsellors paid for by my employer, but they have been terrible. I was forced to see a new one and had my second meeting with her a few days ago. I hadn't discussed my trauma in our first session as I wanted to get to know her a bit first, but before our second session I had suffered a psychological setback and needed someone to talk to. She really pushed for hypnosis. I refused. Then she encouraged me to tell her about my trauma despite my obvious discomfort in giving her details. When I did, she made me repeat myself over again because she wasn't listening. At one point, she suggested I seek out faith healing at a local church, despite my telling her about spiritual abuse I had suffered through an ex-partner. I will never go back to see this counsellor and am left wondering what is the point? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Counsellor wanted to hypnotize me, suggested ""faith healing""

&amp;#x200B;

What are your experiences with counselling? Have you found counselling beneficial? Did you have to see multiple therapists before finding a right match? Is it worth it?

aw8t5h,Complete numbness is destroying my life. Advice?,"Slight, possible TW for mention of court, effects of ptsd etc.

Though I knew I had it for a long time, I was officially diagnosed with PTSD last year. I had the classic, textbook symptoms and then some. I had brief points here and there where I was numb for a while, but nothing to the degree I feel now. I believe (and I've spoken to a therapist about this) that my worsening mental health is because I am currently taking my rapist to court, it's past the GJ, and we are sort of in the waiting stages to see what comes next. I had to make a statement going into explicit detail about my abuse that went on for a long time, which was obviously very upsetting to me. Everything effected me harder in the following months after the investigation began and it got so overwhelming that I ended up quitting my job late last year because there would be days where I'd get so upset I would have to go home. I was seeing 2 therapists and though I've been taught some coping mechanisms, it hasn't helped the numbness at all. I've tried medication... again.. the numbness persists. Now, here is the problem:

I can handle being numb. It's not pleasant, I'd prefer it otherwise, but I can handle it. What I can't handle is feeling nothing towards my family, but more importantly, my husband. I am, under normal circumstances, a very passionate, affectionate partner... but since this has happened, I feel absolutely nothing for him. I feel like I \*know\* deep in my heart that I love him like I know I love my family, but I can't \*feel\* it if that makes sense. We have had our share of issues during all of this and at it's worst, I came extremely close to having an affair. Simply because it felt like an escape from my life. Luckily, we recovered and that person is not in my life anymore, but... the numbness still remains. I keep thinking I'll find a way to flip a switch inside of me and I'll feel things again, but it's just not happening, and to be perfectly frank it's kind of destroying my life. Like I said, I can handle it... I would be able to endure it indefinitely if I had no one but me, but not being able to feel the love I desperately need and know would normally be there is driving me really crazy. It's a constant, daily struggle and worry of mine now. 

I guess the advice I'm looking for is... if anyone else has experienced this... how do you cope? Does it ever end? This is the worst it's ever been for me. There's a lot of advice out there for numbness but I guess I'd like to hear from people in relationships that experienced this. I just really need to see a light at the tunnel, honestly. Everything feels utterly hopeless right now. I just want to know that this isn't my life now.

awd4rw,Want to Share a bit of my Story (TW: sexual abuse),"So right now I'm going through a formal process of bringing ti light some sexual harassment I've suffered, and it's triggered me badly regarding the sexual abuse I endured as a very young adult. I have rarely spoken about it since it happened. I was disssauded from being public about it, and I now realize that those people although well meaning were wrong. 

Because being secret has only added to my shame and has crushed my self esteem. Now I'm realizing I want to be more open, but I thought the Internet is a good place to start. Part of my issue with sharing is that I can't fathom if anyone would have gone through anything equally terrible, although I logically know that of course people have. 

This story is quite traumatic, so don't read if you're feeling fragile:

Well I began being groomed by an older man (49) when I was 17. I was (am) autistic and extremely naive and with somewhat neglectful parents so I was the perfect target  At age 18 he started with the sexual advances and I was lured into a three year thing you can't even call a relationship because it was so disturbed. 

He was also married with three kids and the craziest thing was I ended up living under his roof from age 19 to 22 and was sworn to absolute secrecy. His wife didn't have a clue, but later in the piece, he brainwashed her into watching while he had sex with me about once a week, and at the same time, concealing the real 'relationship' he and I had underneath, where he blackmailed me into having sex with him sometimes several times a day. 

And meantime all this was going on with his children around completely clueless because he was such as clever freakin bastard. Then on top of all that, he manipulated (through suggestiveness) his wife into 'having the idea' that the three of us go out and swing, which basically meant that once every few weeks he'd organize for us to meet with a guy or even a guy and his wife, and I would be effectively gang banged  (gang raped if you take the level of sheer coercion into account). 

In the months leading up to my leaving, he started talking about organizing larger and larger gangbangs (gang rapes) and i have no doubt he would have followed through if I'd not been able to leave. He also photographed and videod a lot of our encounters and I have no doubt he's still watching me naked on tape often as there was no law requiring him to get rid of this.

There were other elements to this abuse too, such as a high level of emotional abuse, cult like spiritual brainwashing, and even after I managed to leave him, it ended with stalking and so me filing for a protection order and an eight month battle through the legal system to get one.

 While I was on the cusp of leaving rhe relationship, I became acutely suicidal because it was so damn hard to get away from him and the people at the mental health center said they'd never seen someone so suidical. 

This man destroyed my life right on the cusp of adulthood. I never got to complete my university degree because I was trapped under him when I should have been there. Also the abuse most likely triggered my health genes, because now I have several quite severe chronic health conditions.

 I completely lost my ability to trust people, and most of my family and friend relationships have failed. Because I can't work, I can't afford proper health care or therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a full blown panic attack for the first time in my life..  I held a gun to my head, apologized to my wife for having to have met me, confessed about my abuse as a child, and pulled the trigger.  I willingly tried to throw my life away...  I black out from here and friends/family have filled in the rest.  my wife filling in the worst details of it all.

TONIGHT:

we are cleaning the house right now and packing up to move back home. (1600 mile move)  I moved our bed aside and broke it down. I kept noticing something shine in the floorboard but I ignored it.  After cleaning the room and sweeping I noticed it was a bullet.  I have not had any guns in 3 years.. I got rid of all of them because I cannot trust myself.    I found the bullet that I carved my mother's initials into because that's how I was going to thank her for giving birth to me.   I found the only bullet I loaded into the magazine of my 1911 and made sure it was in the chamber..  

&amp;#x200B;

I can't help but feel like I do not belong here right now... I am reminded that I wanted to give everything up for silence.. how can I forgive myself and get over this guilt?

aweqdt,I’m not sure if I have PTSD,"TL;DR Might have PTSD and want to know what to ask my therapist when I get an appointment.

&amp;#x200B;

Trigger warning, emotional abuse and mild sexual abuse discussion. View with discretion.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey y’all, not sure what to post. I’ve seen therapists regularly my whole life but never really thought about having PTSD until recently. I’m getting a new, more weekly therapist soon, so TBD on how that’ll go down, but any advice from you all on how to deal with issues and what to talk to your therapist about helps.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the mind rambling/getting things off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been having nightmares and flashbacks on and off, in rare occasions, for a few years now. They aren’t triggered by anything in particular, like a lot of stress or something related to it happening that day. They just…sort of happen randomly.

&amp;#x200B;

All my nightmares/flashbacks happened after high school. I’m in my mid 20s now, and have been living on my own and away from my mother. She’s the main source of my trauma. Lots of emotional abuse and gas lighting. Manipulation. Making me doubt myself because I have autism. Made me hate my dad (divorced) all my life and left many psychological scars that are healing and have been acknowledged, but still sting now and again.

&amp;#x200B;

I may be bipolar, and was diagnosed from a hospital stay (anxiety attack) but then undiagnosed by a psychologist who knew me better later in life. I am certainly manic if I am off my meds, which I know to take regularly and they help keep my mood, anxiety, and depression stable. I am dealing with life quite well all things considered, and have learned to cope, but I still keep getting nightmares and flashbacks to things I thought I had come to peace with.

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to forget my nightmares very quickly, so I never really remember to bring them up at my therapist appointments. And they don’t really bother me in my day to day life. But they are so horrific and so vivid and so strong that I wake up in a cold sweat and an awful feeling in my gut that takes a few hours to go away.

&amp;#x200B;

They are mostly due to fears of my mother (emotionally) hurting me. Berating me. Telling me I’m wrong or forcing me to do something that would trigger my anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

A recurring theme is my mother and step father (both white) having a child of their own, and me (my bio mother’s child, mixed race due to black bio dad) being left behind or feeling like an outsider.

&amp;#x200B;

It was always a fear I had even though my mother never had another child. I always knew I would hate that child. That I would be considered an adopted child when I was a biological one. That me being the mixed-race child of two white parents made me less legitimate somehow. Even though I had no problem with others being adopted. Had I actually been adopted by my mother and step-father, I doubt this would bother me as much. Hell, to this day, if I ever had kids, I would ONLY adopt or foster, never have my own bio kids.

&amp;#x200B;

But for some reason it still bothers me. I mainly feared the other child would be born a white-raced boy: the thing I always wished I would be. But instead I was born a mixed-race girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I am transitioning to be male, and have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. But there’s nothing I can do about my race, not that I’d want to even if I could. I just have these strange thoughts about being mixed with a mind that doesn’t match that identity. It just doesn’t seem to click for me.I very likely have racial dysphoria, as I was raised “culturally white” and had mostly white family and friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I never questioned my race until I was bullied later in life for not fitting in with racial stereotypes. But despite the actual physical abuse I received from my black peers, I never have nightmares about that. Oddly enough, that never bothers me. I kind of resolved it mentally one day by standing up to my bullies, and just like that, the bullying stoped.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven’t had a chance to do that with my other traumas.

&amp;#x200B;

And so, I continue to have these nightmares about the horrible thoughts my mother put into my head about my father doing terrible things to me, about the terrible things my mom DID do to me, and every so often, sexual abuse. It’s rare, but there was a dream that things I am certain never happened to me happened very vividly, and even while unconscious and asleep, I could FEEL it. I woke up in a could sweat, shaken to my core. I felt sick to my stomach.

&amp;#x200B;

I rarely have sexual dreams. I can count on one hand the amount of times I’ve had dreams with any sort of represented sexual idea, even if was just a kiss or a lustful thought. I never see or feel genitals, think about sex, or dream about another partner in a sexual manner. But the few others I have had have all been in my adult life, within the last \~5 years. I was reminded of this because I had one just today, and I was able to see and feel genital stimulation. I didn’t feel anything pleasurable or painful about it, just that it was happening and it was not something I minded but didn’t really want either. Just…meh.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know if my lack of sexual dreams come from some sort of dysphoria or repressed sexual trauma. I can’t think of anything that would count as an event to say “Yes, this happened to me,” but I feel like something did. I can’t explain why I was so oddly sexual as a child. Maybe it’s my autism. Maybe something did happen to me as a kid. But the way I acted as a kid was not normal and I feel like someone should have noticed it sooner. My sexual identity is a mess and I still don’t understand what to do with myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m pretty lost as to where to go from here. I thought I had come to peace with these things. I’ve gone through so much therapy and talked about my problems to so many professionals. I don’t know why I still feel so unresolved with these issues I’ve never really had.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice helps. I don’t even know what I could do with my therapist other than talk about how these events make me feel and what I’ve done to cope with them. I’m not sure there’s much else I CAN do.

&amp;#x200B;

awkcqi,Job Search,"Yesterday, I went in to interview for a job I applied for about a month ago, and I've been feeling pretty down since coming to some realizations. Whether of not I get an offer isn't so much of an issue, I'm just really scared at the possibility of working somewhere I hate, or that is as toxic as my former employer. My boss at my old job sexually harassed and emotionally abused me, and this resurfaced a lot of trauma that I had spent years working through. My co-workers were complacent (possibly out of fear of retaliation if they spoke out, since this organization has a history of  sexual harassment being reported and unresolved) and HR was no help. This was my dream job, so I continued to stay as the abuse worsened my health and ability to complete assignments, which resulted in me being fired for ""not being a good fit."" Part of me wishes I never started working there, but another part of me blames myself for not doing a ""better"" job and sticking through what was happening. I've now been unemployed since mid-October, and I feel scared and confused most of the time.

Trigger warning: sexual abuse

I am seeing a new therapist soon, on a more weekly basis, but have seen a therapist regularly for my whole life. However, I never really realized I might have ptsd until starting my new job, where I talk to people about their disabilities and ask about how they affect their life. This made me start questioning myself and now I’m wondering if some things might be related to past trauma I hadn’t thought about before.

I know I was emotionally and psychologically abused by my mother as a child. She manipulated me into hating my bio father. She gaslit me and made me doubt myself because I have autism. She antagonized me when I had anxiety attacks and generally made me feel like I was never good enough. I occasionally get nightmares about this sort of abuse and have learned to recognize and cope with it, though I will be working through it more with my new therapist once I get one.

What is starting to concern me is my sexuality. I have gender dysphoria, and have recently started testosterone. Being more my true self has let me explore my sexuality, and having a new partner who is very open to exploring has made me realize some possibly concerning things.

I never have sexual dreams. Never so much as a kiss or a partially naked person appears in my dreams in a sexual context.

I can count on one hand how many sexual dreams I have had in my life, and two where nightmares. The nightmares were complete fantasy, and I am certain something like that never happened, but it was so vivid and so painful, I could actually feel it in an unconscious state. I woke up feeling sick to my stomach.

These sorts of dreams are extremely rare, but the fact that I had them at all, and such a strong reaction to them makes me worried that it may be related to something traumatic more than just not being in control of my body,
and having others hurt me in a way where I couldn’t escape.

The other sexual dreams I have are so “meh” that, had they not been so rare, I wouldn’t notice them. I had a dream the other day where I was with another person receiving stimulation from them. I could see we were naked and could feel them touching me. It was vivid, and in the context of the dream, this was a person I was attracted to. I didn’t really want it, but I didn’t really hate it either. It was just...meh. Whatever. 

The dream later continued with the same person and another pursuing me romantically, and that was much more satisfying for me. Even dreams like that are rare, where someone desires my affection, and genuinely pursued me instead of I them. 

I question my sexual desires as well. I think I am some sort of demi/pansexual. Most of my attraction is purely emotional and romantic with a person who has a good character. I have body types I prefer, but it’s the personality that attracts me. I can have sex, and actively seek to please my partners. But as far as my own pleasure, I simply don’t enjoy sexually pleasuring myself outside of masturbation in private. It just isn’t the same. Even if I am totally in control of my pleasure with another person, it just doesn’t do it for me.

This is where things get messy for me. I’ve always been an oddly sexual child, before I understood what it meant. I gave “bedroom eyes” and tried to look “sexy”, not cute, in photos, even family photos. I remember posing for a Xmas photo for family and licking a candy cane in a sexual manner. My mother told me to just lick it normally. I didn’t understand what I had done until much later in life. I had to be about 15 at the time. I don’t know why I did it, I just know that I did.

I gave my half brother a very noticeable hickey, and sucked on his neck, and he did the same with me, although I didn’t have the marks to prove it. Our dad caught us, and told us not to play like that any more. I initiated it. His mark was so obvious his mom made a joke about it, and we as a family agreed to never speak of it again.

I didn’t grow up with my half brother, I didn’t live with or see him outside of weekend visits to my dad’s house, where he lived, so I didn’t grow up thinking of him as my brother the way others who grew up with siblings do. But I still knew it was wrong. And I kind of knew it was sexual, but we never kissed on the lips or did anything else. I just knew it felt good to suck on his neck, and it felt good when he sucked on mine. But it was me who initiated it. And that concerns me.

I have autism, so I’m always a little behind with the social norm of when people experience things, and I’m especially a late bloomer when it came to actually having sex. I was so afraid to loose my virginity I actually had an anxiety attack. Thankfully I was able to try again with the same person later and became very comfortable very quickly. But I have always been eager to please others, especially when it comes to sexual acts.

I like to give, not receive. And this has left me frustrated in the bedroom. I just keep waiting for it to start to feel as good as it does when I masturbate, and it never does. Maybe my partners just aren’t patient enough to get me there, maybe I just don’t like it that much. But pretty much everything, from penetration to external stimulation does nothing for me. I just don’t have any sensitivity.

I don’t know if it my gender dysphoria, my autism, an interesting form of asexualilty or demisexuality, or some sort ptsd that is shaping my feelings about sex and my sexuality. I’m so confused and lost I don’t know what to discuss with my therapist or how. This is the one thing I can’t fully explain about myself. I can’t think of an episode that would have triggered me to be like this. I don’t seem to have any triggers either. These things just sort of happen at random.

So with all that out on the table, what do you all think? How should I discuss this with my therapist? What can I expect going into a session to deal with this? Any similar thoughts you’ve had or experiences?

Any insight helps.

awsyxk,Relationship development issues,"I've suffered from what I think is PTSD for several years now and tried to keep it bottled up and denying the facts of what happened to me. I still have nightmares on a regular basis, but I don't breakdown in public or at work anymore usually. I really just fake it constantly so people I'm around don't sit in judgement of me. 

I haven't had a successful romantic relationship with someone in as long as I've been suffering. I really push people away so I don't have to be touched or touch other people. I have been on plenty of dates but I can't handle physically escalating with the women I date. I've wanted to tell these women that I want to hold them I want to tell them about the pain I continue to live with. I want to have a live with children and a loving relationship but I can't handle telling about what happened. I saw a doctor about coming to terms with my problems but living in denial is really all I can do. 

I don't know how to change, sometimes I progressively count and arrange patterns and I feel less out of control but then someone looks at what I'm doing and then I go back to faking it. Does anyone who has overcome stuff like this have any suggestions or good coping skills they could share with me? How do you explain to the worst thing that ever happened to you to someone and get them not to leave you? Any recommendations or suggestions would be appreciated.

upon disclosing my symptoms to two psychiatrists and other additional anxiety traits they diagnosed me with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). many times i felt as if my flashbacks were some form of an entity, i found myself losing touch with reality and no matter how much i tried to drag my head out of the mud and the ''drowning'' feeling psychologically, it just wouldn't work. accepting the sensation, meditating, fighting it or even going to sleep would not stop an episode. it was a health epidemic that left me feeling extremely hopeless and disinterested in all areas of life, i was quite sure that i was some rare case of a schizophrenic who cannot be cured or fixed. 

these flashbacks would generally invoke the same feeling time and time after again, sometimes the flashbacks would be covert (come in suddenly no cause) or overt (come in with a cause such as obsessive images which leads to a flashback).

these feelings could typically last from 2-10 hours, generally i return to normal after it passes but many times i still have residual symptoms such as anhedonia and even worry that it will make a comeback which leads to compulsion seeking and asking a million questions online.

the symptoms would typically be described as a feeling of being back into a headspace that was distressing, it feels so drastic to the point you're convinced that said event was happening all over again. there is a sudden change in the atmosphere, it feels that another ''identity'' takes over your body, and that the real you has drifted away, you then start to feel a strong sense of depression, hopelessness, irritability, anger, nausea, etc. eventually it reaches a snowballing effect to the point it can create tension in your whole body and even when you try to relieve the psychological symptoms, nothing works.  

&amp;#x200B;

in 2017 i was prescribed Zoloft, quite quickly went up to 200mg, i found that 60% of my OCD was neutralised and that my flashbacks were much quicker and less frequent however still occurring on a weekly basis sucking the wind out of me and leaving me in a dump for a day or 2, i was then put on low dose seroquel with risperidone and found that episodes were much less frequent to the point i would go into remission for 2-3 months at a time, i decided i was going to stop both of those meds as i reached obesity levels and the side effects weren't good, my doctor agreed to help me stop it. upon stopping the two meds, i was and still am on Zoloft, i noticed that the remission continued into 4-5 months, until three days ago i had the same dark episode as i did a few years back, i've now been haunted by this and it feels i am slipping into the same delusional dissociative rabbit hole again with no way out. any words of encouragement xx?",your_godammn_right,2019-03-03 08:35:56,9,535,63.11,33.36,93.5,4.69,38.21,20.19,86.73,52.71,14.58,8.22,6.17,0,1.87,0,0.19,6.36,7.1,12.71,7.66,5.61,6.73,1.5,14.95,4.67,2.62,0.93,2.62,2.99,5.42,1.68,3.74,1.31,0.56,0.93,3.55,0,0,0,0,13.27,4.86,2.24,1.5,3.36,1.12,2.06,3.18,0.37,0.19,2.24,4.49,0.93,3.55,0,0.19,4.67,0.37,1.5,2.24,0.37,0.93,5.23,5.98,1.31,18.5,3.18,7.1,8.79,1.31,0.19,0,0,0.37,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.52,2.24,4.86,0,0.37,0.37,0,0.56,0,2.43,1.12,0.56

awysx5,Therapist recommendation (A story from my past) ¡ trigger warning ! Contains talk of bullying and sexual harassment,"Some context:
My name is Katherine, and I’m a 21 year old college student at Oregon State University, or at least I was for the past two years. Currently, I live at home where I’m taking online courses and attending various medical appointments that were interrupting my school life. The primary appointment has been therapy, though, which I attend every week for an hour.
Recently, my therapist has been informing me that I have some really bad ptsd, which has been a hard reality to come to since I live with my dad who is a war veteran and has incomparable ptsd. I’ve always felt like it was an insult to him and others to even consider myself a victim of the mental condition. My therapist has started giving me ptsd treatment, however, and a lot of things have come to light.
So, here I am. My therapist has recommended I share some of my stories anonymously with other people as a means to cope. I also want to bring to light for other people that it’s okay to be haunted by a past experience, just because somebody is worse off than you doesn’t mean you don’t need help too. 
Hooooo... so here I go.
I grew up with anxiety my entire life, which in my early years caused me to cry as a response to any confrontation. Of course, as you can imagine, this made me an easy victim. I also have mild ASD (autism spectrum disorder) which made it only easier to mess with me.
I experience a plethora of things that moulded me into my current mindset. Girls from my sports team who would rake their cleats down my legs and tell me I’m worthless, boys who would tell me how ugly and disgusting I am, and ‘friends’ who would hit me and force into uncomfortable situations. These were all classic cases of bullying, but it was when the bullying turned into sexual harassment that it really began to hurt me.
Boys would spread rumors about me, saying my vagina was disgusting and nobody would ever want to touch me. I was ugly and worthless, and people would talk about it right in front of me. They went as far as playing hangman games in our class free time where the answers were “(boys name) licks Katherine’s vagina”, and a chorus of “ewww”s would ensue. I was hit, harassed, and made a spectacle of in front of my peers for them to laugh at. I became isolated, bullied by even the ‘friends’ I held dear who would regularly start fights and leave me threatening notes in my locker detailing how disgusting I was. 
And I would cry. I would have massive breakdowns where my anxiety would take over and I became hyper sensitive to all the things they did to me. People spread rumors that I stalked them, took pictures of them in their sleep to save for later. I was lured in when people were nice, then beat down relentlessly later.
The worst experience I had occurred on the bus when I was about 12. This older guy, in early high school I think, sat near me and my brother and always looked at me. Then one day he started making rape jokes and threats towards me, telling my brother how I was ‘hot’ and how my brother should fuck me. I was terrified, I barely understood what he was implying, but it scared me enough to send me shaking and crying home. My brother told my mom who called the school. The guy was banned from the bus, but never suspended or reprimanded further. Some days he would still climb in the bus, and nobody cared enough to do anything. 
I was conditioned into thinking I was nothing but a monster, a disgusting glom of oil and dirt. I was an ogre, bumbling around covered in rotting flesh. The rumors kept going until I would sit all alone whenever I could, and I stopped trying to interact with anybody. To this day, my body is like a giant ball of mucus, a deformed disgusting creature. I have ptsd episodes where I have severe panic attacks where all I can think about is how much of a gross, awful failure I am. I can’t breathe, I can’t speak, and only recently have I developed coping methods beyond self mutilation. Sometimes I lose consciousness all together, and I faint and crumple to the ground. I have a hard time trusting people with my emotions, and struggle to be emotionally involved with people anymore. 
1 year ago my ex broke up with me, saying I was disgusting and they never wanted to touch me in any way shape or form. Then when I had a panic attack they began to accuse me of committing domestic abuse because I yelled at them. I lost all my close friends because my ex spread rumors about me. They follow me to this day, and I can’t feel welcome in my own town I worked so hard for.
So, since I have to get all this off my chest somehow, I agreed to talk on the internet with some support groups. I want to spread awareness of the lasting affects that bullying can cause, and how much it can interfere with daily life for many years after.

The first time, he'd collapsed outside my cousins house and we were only alerted because of blue lights outside. It was dark. We had a horrible feeling that we'd know who the body on the floor was, and we did. I cant get that fucking horrific image out of my head. They got his heartbeat back but he never regained consciousness. He was taken off life support 2 days later and died again on NYE.

I was watching something with my boyfriend last night and a character shouted ""don't let him die"". Before I knew what was happening I realised I was crying uncontrollably and my boyfriend had wetsuits his arms around me and was trying to calm me down and comfort me. All I could hear was mums voice that night screaming ""don't let him die"".

Please, please can anybody help me with advice on how to get rid of these flashbacks? I was in a first fire at the age of 11 and even now I'll get flashbacks but they've become easier in the last 13 years. I always struggle on the anniversary though.

awzoet,Alternatives to Kratom for PTSD," 

I'm  sure this post has been made at some point before, but I'm having  trouble finding it at the moment. Basically, I have extremely severe  C-PTSD that prevents me from functioning normally without kratom. I  don't even have PTSD symptoms while I am going through the acute  symptoms of withdrawal. I am trying to get through school in spite of  having severe ptsd and probably some form of schizotypy. I got medical  marijuana, which helps immensely with the ptsd, but it is giving me  short term memory problems. Also, it does not give me the same degree of  cognitive boost and clarity that kratom brings. Not that it is  completely terrible in that regard, but any task involving short term  memory is definitely impaired. I am left with the normal mental issues  that come with PTSD even though I am not actively experiencing it.  Kratom is the thing that makes my brain feel the most like it did before  the traumatic experiences.

The problem  with that is that I do not want to be on it long term or all the time  for reasons that I hope are self-evident, and it is also making my hair  fall out. I am non-binary transgendered and this causes me extreme  dysphoria (note: I already stopped taking my T at this point once I  realized I still pass; it's definitely just the kratom now).  I have  tried numerous pharmaceuticals. Standard pharmaceutical reuptake  inhibitors make me suicidal or want to vomit. Standard antipsychotics  cause me to hallucinate. Actually, every pharmaceutical I've ever tried  has just effected me in a terrifying or harmful way, if it did  anything....so I would very much like to steer clear of those. Any  recommendations? I already exercise and have tried various herbs, none  of which come close to the relief kratom provides. So many, in fact that  instead of listing them I will comment if I have tried your  recommendation before, because tbh I'm not sure I can even keep track of  them all.

ax03e0,Paranoia negatively affecting my life.,"x wife had an affair fro months and gaslit me. There were many instances that I caught her. Once I ripped the dude out of the car but his buddies ended up jumping me and putting a knife to my throat. My sense of self worth is pretty fucked from this along. But around the same time,  my ""friends"" all went behind my back for months and betrayed me, basically ratting me out for something we were all doing. (distributing mushrooms, but I was the manufacturer. The DEA busted in my house in the morning, my wife let them in. I was arrested, but after 3 days was bailed out by family contributions from both my family and hers. And at the same time I was trying to graduate college while facing 35 years of prison, working as a research assistant, and a supervisor at a liquor store (I graduated, somehow). (60hrs/week total, while in school full time) I eventually graduated somehow, while going through a divorce. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been two years, I'm sort of in the field I now want to be in, making money I want to make, but I've reached a very depressed spot in my life. I'm hypersensitive to noise, and very paranoid in public, and experience major anxiety around authority figures or people ""masquerading"" as my friends. I jsut spent all weekend in my bed because I'm exhausted and I feel like I've been ""pushing through it"" ever since all this went down. I didn't have a chance to relax while I was in college because I didn't want this to be the reason I failed, so I pushed through it. Then when I graduated, I pushed through some more to get a job in the payscale that I wanted. And now I've got it, but I have no one in my life anymore. And I have so much guilt about everything, and am confused about everything still. I have flashbacks to the many instances of emotional turmoil that existed at that time, and whenever I do it debilitates me for a week or more. 

&amp;#x200B;

In that phase of my life, so much fucked up shit was going on. Now everything is silent but I don't want to isolate. But if I go out or hang out with friends, its like I am on edge, waiting for something, watching for manipulation, hyper aware of everything around me that I do not come across as normal or relaxed. I haven't been able to relax since all of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, rant off. I just wanted to reach out to people who might understand. I'm exhausted just being awake because I'm always so ""ON"" all the time. I'm just super tense around people and can feel myself starting to isolate and I'm not sure what to do, because I know it's just going to get worse if I keep doing this, but I can't present myself as this fucked up version of myself anymore.

ax0hb8,Post-Traumatic Stress &amp; Hypersensitivity,"I've struggled with post-traumatic stress for nearly three years due to a specific incident ( I won't go into detail now). I was essentially in shock for a few months and had a lot of panic attacks.  There was a lot of hyperventilating and ugly crying going on.  After about 6 months the panic attacks decreased and I began to have migraines.  Overtime I got to a point where I was having a few migraines a week.  Thankfully I have that more under control, but I have noticed I am hypersensitive to bright lights, fragrances, chemicals, etc.  I feel as if these things are attacking me and they actually trigger a migraine in many cases.  I know that I my perception of the lighting or fumes do not match reality.  I thought everyone was out of their minds staying in a room with paint fumes like that.  I'm not able to watch TV as it is ""too bright"" for me to look at and gives me an instant headache.  I'm able to use a computer with the monitor turned down and blue blocking (e.g. night shift or f.Lux) enabled.  I've been researching Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) and I find that my symptoms align with the descriptions.  Do you have PTSD and struggle with hypersensitivity, MCS, or migraines?

I am employed as a senior phone support  advisor for a major tech company and work from home. I am currently on my 2nd medical leave due to PTSD from child hood trauma. I have completed 2  DBT programs and scheduled to start EMDR within the next month. My Dr. is has to send my latest medical and asked me to make a list of accommodations  to give me the best chance of success in minimizing suffering.  He said he will pretty much put anything I give him and they either say ok or they don’t.
Problem is anytime I even think about going back to the same job sends me to a near panic attack. I guess my question is since my main function is to talk to (angered) people on the phone would asking for another position that is not dealing with the public be considered reasonable? This would be in addition to other things like flexible schedule, time off, etc.
 I am also very worried what may happen if they can’t make the accommodations the Dr sends them. I know they have long term disability but It will only cover 2 years for any mental issue.

ax1p1g,when people dont respect the diagnosis,"trigger warnings: cars, driving, unsupportive family 

about three weeks ago i got diagnosed with car crash related ptsd after three years of suffering from it and it getting increasingly worse. my college counselor told me about it and i live out of state so this is the first time ive seen my family since getting the diagnosis. 

to me this was a surprise and a relief- im not just a wuss or unduly paranoid; i have untreated ptsd. im not just being stupid and sensitive, ive been traumatized. this was very validating for me and all my friends were like “uh yeah duh isnt it obvious?” which was good because it showed they cared and were paying attention. not so much for my family. 

my dad is great and drives carefully so i dont frequently get triggered, though it just happens sometimes on the road and theres nothing he can do about that. my mom on the other hand hasnt changed her driving at all and was the one who was always more road-ragey and fast and slammed on her brakes. knowing ive been diagnosed with ptsd, knowing i just had to endure a 5 hour car ride from my college, and knowing that being a passenger AND driving both freak me out, she asked me to go to the store down the street to get her something. 

i felt terrible about it but i timidly said i really didnt want to do it and that being a passenger is one thing but driving is a whole other fish to fry. she didnt say anything. she just grabbed her stuff, looked at me with annoyance in her eyes, and huffed and left to do it herself. 

I cried for two hours because i felt like a failure and a burden on the family because i just couldnt bring myself to drive. forcing myself to suck it up and drive these past three years has made me experience even worse symptoms of ptsd and anxiety, so im trying to heal by doing what my counselor said: slowly reintroduce yourself to cars and driving. just sit in a car for an hour. dont turn it on, just sit. know that it cant hurt me like this. I havent even done that once yet and for some reason my mom thought it would be ok to just go out and do errands as usual. when my absolute worst fear is dying or killing someone in a car accident. 

Then my sister asked if i wanted to go out to eat before she went back to college. i went through the usual “YAY FOOD” and then “oh no cars” that has been happening for the last few months; this fear has been stopping me from doing fun things because i love the things but hate how i have to get there. so in trying to enjoy spring break and not stress myself out even more, I said no, im sorry, but i just cant deal with cars anymore today. she said “youll be fine” as if that was gonna make me less traumatized by cars. when i get scared of a honk happening outside in a parking lot when im in the second story of a huge cinderblock building. 

what’s with my family and not caring about my diagnosis? all of this is hurting me more. they keep saying i have to “deal with it” but theyre expecting me to deal with it in a way that doesnt take away from my average everyday life. news flash: ptsd doesnt care about being inconvenient! it doesnt care that i have a life to live! it just makes me afraid all the time and ive been living with it, suffocating under it for years without treatment and they expect me to be all better? like im not trying my best already? like i dont want to be ok with being in cars again, with being independent again? 

I just had to rant about this here. i feel so alone in this and so powerless. can anyone offer me any encouragement or advice? im sure some people have had to deal with people who werent supportive and it would really make me feel better to know that for sure. it feels like ptsd is valid when other people have it but my family doesnt care that i have it too.",Samalgam,2019-03-03 18:18:15,4,740,21.43,14.9,85.82,16.15,18.97,12.7,93.92,61.08,20.14,11.89,9.59,0,0.27,1.62,0.41,8.24,4.19,13.92,11.35,6.62,8.38,3.65,20.95,4.05,2.7,1.49,1.35,2.43,7.43,3.38,4.05,1.08,0.68,0.95,7.3,1.35,0.14,1.89,0.27,13.11,2.57,2.03,1.35,2.3,1.62,4.32,2.7,0.54,0.81,1.22,2.43,0.27,1.62,0,0.41,5.54,1.35,1.22,1.22,1.76,0.95,5.95,12.43,0.81,13.92,3.38,4.86,5.95,1.08,0.95,0.81,0.27,0,0.27,1.49,0.41,0.14,0.68,0.27,0,9.73,4.05,2.16,0.41,0.27,0.81,0.27,0.27,1.35,0.14,0,0
ax22sp,Partner Understands for First Time in 14 Years,"Hey, all. I suffer from PTSD stemming from a span of 8 years of physical and emotional abuse by my stepfather when I was a child. This abuse has shaped my whole life as a person. It has been very hard. I have pretty much been on medication and in therapy constantly since graduating from college. I function. I'm a mom. I'm a good mom! I am doing okay. :)

Anyway, we were watching the R. Kelly documentary, and there's a part where one of his victims says, ""I either had to find a way to kill me or kill him."" During a commercial break, I turned to my husband and I said to him, ""I used to keep broken scissors under my mattress in my bedroom, because I just got so mad some days that I swore that I was going to kill him if he came up into my room to hurt me or yell at me."" 

I could see my husband was shocked at this announcement. It took him a few minutes to sputter, ""I...I never knew just how intense it was for you."" I added on to that that the reason I do not like open doors is because I would always keep my door closed, because it would mean it would be one more barrier between me and my stepdad, and it would give me one more second to grab the scissors if I needed to. 

He was pretty visibly upset by that. 

But, I can't tell you how validating it was. I don't talk much about my specific abuse and what happened to me, so maybe that is why he never really understood.

Even in the midst of almost dying from severe IBD. I was only 6, hospitalized for internal bleeding and infection risk. I had IV drugs and a TPN picc line for months. I was just so so sick, but I recovered fully, I didn't feel very traumatized at all despite it being so awful.

Probably because I didn't even really understand what the fuck was going on.

But then flare after flare over the years, and I almost had to have major surgery back when I was 14. The pain from then traumatized me. I felt so helpless and hopeless, nothing was working and no one could help me for months on end I just suffered. 


After that I have never been the same. I can't eat certain foods that remind me of that time, and I've lost a lot of trust in doctors to help me before things get too bad. 


I just wish I could have the innocence of a child again so I could move on. Especially to help me trust medical professionals again after an I was sent to an abusive rehab program to heal from the medical trauma.

ax44rq,I had a dream....,"I had a vivid dream last night I was wondering around my highschool (it’s been nearly 10 years since I graduated) and I felt myself feeling so comfortable and happy there. Then I found a room that was elementary students, their eyes all filled up with joy,  curiosity and innocence and I felt this overwhelming sense of longing to be that. I never had a childhood. My trauma started from birth and lasted all the way until I was 20. I wish so badly I could have had innocence, had childhood wonder. An I wished more than anything I could go back to that dream and be one of those kids. 

I’ve got a kid of my own now and I often feel jealous that they get to have so much that I didn’t, but also so proud that I get to give someone else the childhood I wish I could have had. One with two loving parents, with laughter and joy. I feel like I’ve finally come to this beautiful place where I can experience the dark feelings of my PTSD without being overwhelmed by them, that I can cry for an hour or two then wipe my tears and know in my heart that it’s okay to be sad, to feel betrayed, to feel it was unjust and unfair. But it doesn’t get to take my life away from me, that I get to decide who I wanna be despite having so much taken away. Even more I realized today playing with my child that I can experience childhood in a way, with my kiddo every time we play together, every time we stop to stare at an ant for 30 minutes. It’s my job to teach, and my protect my child but I’m learning that she is teaching me so much too.",im-opinionated,2019-03-03 22:51:41,0,309,18.82,10.95,97.7,43.46,23.77,12.3,96.76,60.19,22.98,15.86,13.92,0.65,0,0.32,0.97,7.12,3.88,12.62,11.65,5.83,8.09,1.29,20.71,2.59,1.29,0.65,2.27,2.91,7.44,4.21,3.24,0.65,0.32,1.94,5.18,0.32,0,0.32,0,13.92,5.5,0.32,2.27,2.27,1.62,2.91,5.5,1.62,0.32,2.59,0.97,0.65,0.32,0,0,7.12,1.62,0.32,2.27,2.27,0.65,6.47,11.33,1.62,13.27,0.65,4.85,8.09,2.59,1.62,0.32,0,0,0,0.65,0,0,0.32,0,0,12.3,5.18,3.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.59,0.65,0

ax4m1b,I had a PTSD freak out at work and I feel really ashamed,"Hi. I'm not very open about this stuff, so forgive my awkwardness. I was diagnosed at age 16.

I don't remember what happened to me in my childhood. I remember bits and pieces here and there of random things, but most of my childhood is extremely disassociated up until age 14. I have problems validating myself of the abuse that I suffered through because... Well... I can't remember it. There's other shitty shit that happened from 14+ on wards, but I don't feel it pertains to this.

I work with kids who have Autism as my job. I really like it, honestly. I accompany them at schools and help work with them throughout the day, managing behaviors, emotional regulation, etc. I was working with a kid in 2nd grade. 

He was having a pretty not great day, and I was getting a little frustrated but nothing too major. It all fell apart when he tried to cut my hair. I moved away in time, no biggie, it happens, but then he held the blades up an inch from my eyes, pretended to stab and snip, and then pretend to throw them at me. I nearly lost it when he wound his arm back. I started freaking out inside, I felt my adrenaline rush, and all of the sudden the only thing my brain screamed at me was ""WE'RE GOING TO FUCKING *DIE. HE'S GOING TO* ***KILL US*****.""** 

Barely holding it together, he ran off from me and hid in his break room. He barricaded the door and kept himself in there. The teacher noticed what was happening and came over to support me. I managed to take a break of mine for a few minutes and I completely broke down. One half of my brain was scolding me, saying things like ""He wasn't actually going to hurt you, you know his behaviors, you know how this works. This isn't logical."" While the other side of me was completely whirling in pain, confusion, and complete and utter terror. Going through that cycle of emotions was fucking agony, and what only made it hurt worse was in the midst of it my only thought was my brain going, ""I remember feeling like this before.""

It didn't get better. Come nightfall I completely broke down, freaking out and having a depression episode, self-harm tendencies were nagging, ED thoughts were high, and I was just a complete wreck of a human being. Didn't eat, hardly slept, I picked fights with my boyfriend, I was incredibly insecure, etc. I couldn't even go to work the next day because my absolute *terror* of this kid throwing pencils and scissors at me was too strong.

I had to be reassigned to a new child. I feel so humiliated, frustrated, confused, and just so angry. It feels so hard to move past from, and I feel like I can't even tell my work what's going on due to an instilled fear from my Mom that if I told anyone about anything regarding my mental health, I would be fired instantly. I need this job so that I can receive mental health assistance to lead a functional life, but it feels so impossible to navigate through life - especially when you're suffering from this disorder, but you can't even remember the fucking things that caused it in the first place. I only get more information when triggers come up, and I'm forced to relive the horrible emotions all over again.",Schizii,2019-03-03 23:55:55,12,594,33.01,16.44,94.57,1,16.5,17.68,93.43,59.09,21.21,14.31,10.61,0.34,0.84,2.02,0.51,6.9,4.38,13.97,6.9,7.24,7.74,2.36,17.68,4.04,1.68,1.68,1.01,1.35,8.42,1.35,6.73,1.35,2.19,1.52,7.07,0.17,0.17,0.17,2.19,13.8,4.04,1.52,1.01,1.85,2.02,3.7,2.53,0.17,0.34,2.02,3.2,1.35,1.18,0.51,0.17,8.59,1.18,2.02,4.38,1.01,0.51,8.08,8.25,1.35,15.32,3.37,6.73,5.22,3.2,0,0.34,0,0,0.34,1.52,1.35,0,0,0.17,0,20.03,6.73,6.57,0,0,0,0,0.34,1.01,2.86,0,2.53
ax5d71,Hit kind of a turning point where things are getting bad again. I just can't stop feeling it,"One month ago I left my abusive relationship. Before this relationship, I already was diagnosed with PTSD after being raped in December 2016. I hadn't been struggling much with specific symptoms for a little while, mostly just general bad mental health stuff and stress from the abusive relationship. However, I kind of hit a really rough spot this weekend and I think it's going downhill again. 

While I was in that relationship, I think I had to just ignore and rationalize and completely push down the things he did to me. But now that I'm out of it I think it's really really starting to hit me hard. I haven't been sleeping for the past week and when I do I have terrible nightmares about him. I'm so hyperalert all the time. I can't stop thinking about it and just break down often. I'm so scared constantly, even when I shouldn't be. I feel absolutely devastated. It's like I'm really processing the abuse for the first time.

I am planning on going back to therapy ASAP but won't be able to for at least another two weeks. I have been attending a weekly relationship abuse support group and plan on leaning on them for a little bit of support. Is there anything else I can do to help myself in the meantime? I am trying to focus on self-care and healthy habits but it is hard. I really need to be able to keep going to my classes because I just fianlly got back on track.

tldr: the reality of the abusive relationship I left a month ago is starting to hit me and my PTSD is coming back quickly. I won't be able to go to a therapist for at least another two weeks. What can I do to take care of and help myself in the meantime?

ax6dv2,Abusers get out of prison very soon,"I’m a victim of long term (up until I was 12-13) sexual, physical, emotional and verbal abuse as a child, my abusers were my grandfather and my siblings.

I’m going to apologize in advanced I’m on Mobil, it’s 4 am, I should be sleeping so I’m understandably sleepy and the formatting won’t be the best but I’m just really in need of some advice. 

Well for starters I’m 17 my birthday is in a couple days and instead of being able to feel excitement I’m only feeling panic and impending doom.  My abusers get out of prison in August and September and I’m so insanely panicky and having insane episodes relaying my trauma the more these dates creep sooner and no body around me seems to understand in the slightest way. I recently stopped therapy cold turkey going from a session every week for three years because my family had to move due to the upcoming releases of said abusers. I’ve been having worse night terrors and night sweats, I’m hyper aware of everything, I don’t feel comfortable in my own skin anymore everything just getting worse and I don’t know how to deal with it all. My grandmother is choosing to stay with this monster after everything he has done to me and my sister. I don’t understand why she would give up everything to still be with this monster and I feel like it’s somehow my fault for not giving her enough attention and love so she’s seeking it from this man. My mother, sister, and I have repeatedly told her that we probably wouldn’t stay in contact with her if she chooses to take this route, leaving the home she built from the ground up, raised her children in, she has so many memories and it’s her dream home I don’t understand I’m so hurt that she would give up everything she loves for someone who sexually violated her grandchildren. Everything has been so hard lately and I guess I’m just trying to say that I wish I had some friends who knew what I was going through  and who could give me advice on how to deal with everything. It feels like nobody around me seems to understand, my boyfriend always gets angry and upset and slanders my grandmother and abusers whenever I try to talk about it or just tells me that maybe I shouldn’t focus on it. He also has trauma from his childhood but hes dealt with it by suppressing it and I wish I could do the same but it’s my every thought, I could be making dinner and a sound could trigger a memory which snowballs into a panic attack and bombarding visuals from my childhood.

I’m still waiting for a therapy and psychiatry appointment... it’s been 4 weeks and I still can’t get a call back. (My husband is military, so I have to go through military channels.)

Is there a free resource I can share my thoughts and concerns on AND get responses?

ax9god,I am terrified of annihilation but still wish I never existed.,"If I don't get enough sleep, which is basically every night now that university has started, all I can think of is how awful the world is, how doomed everything feels and that I wish I could disappear. Yet I'm so fucking fearful of death. I cannot stop that feeling of trying to conceptualise non-perception. Non-existence. 
Would suicide be a perceived as basically infinite pain. What was not existing like, I can't remember. I'm sure my personality is just a product of my biology and experiences, but why do I feel so hesitant and attached to let it go.

That people who were traumatized by abusers have to deal with all of this shit and suffer all the consequences. I wouldn't even be in this position if it weren't for him. I was punished when he abused me, and now I'm still being punished in my adult life, because of what he did to me. He fundamentally changed me, and I can't get my self back. Some people don't know me anymore or wonder why I can't do things like I used to, because that old person before my abuse and before I realized it was abuse is loooooong gone. 

It sucks that I have to deal with this everyday, while he gets off with nothing. I already lost to him before this even begun.

Afterwards for 3 months i felt like nothing was real and i was in a dream. I had times where I'd get reminded and start shaking very often. Like nearly every day, sometimes a few times a day. 

Then i slowly got out of the dream amd the times when i got reminded got progressively less and less. The first year - year and a half was HELL ON EARTH and i really suffered and developed some bad self harm stuff. Felt terrible and things that reminded me terrified me. 

Last time i had a ""flashback"" i had a nightmare very similar to what happened that night years ago and i woke up in sweats and shaking and wanted to vomit. That was a month and a half ago. Since then i had a minor thing reminding me but i shook it off and wasn't too bothered by it. Thay was 2 weeks ago.

Do i have PTSD? I feel like i don't, like lately apart from the very occasional ""flashback"" it doesn't really bother me too much.

! Violent experience! 
(If anyone has an issue reading or wants this post removed or I have broken any rules I am very sorry and I will take it down without question)


First a little backstory and some information. I live in a highly populated town outside of Philadelphia. 

I had this dog named Murphy and he was a Jack Russel terrier very fast and energetic. My mother is allergic and so my grandparents let him stay at their house. We didn’t have a fenced in yard so we took him around our yard on a leash. Next door there was an older couple in their late 40s who had two pit bulls. One a puppy and the other quite old. I am currently 16 but was 12 when this happened. I got to my grandparents from school and went to take the dog out. The other dogs were out and my dog wasn’t very friendly and neither were they. I walked him around the yard and went by the side of the house. It’s a very tight corridor and doesn’t get any more wider than maybe 5 feet from the house to the neighbors fence. 
! Final warning for any triggers ! 

I never noticed that at the bottom of the fence there were holes in it. I walked my dog up the side and it happened. These two very large pit bulls had came under the fence and were now biting and regrowing around my 17 pound dog. I instantly screamed for help while it was going on. These two dogs were on the verge of killing my dog and nearly did. They had been throwing him around like a child’s toy and we were now in the front yard.
(more backstory) 
(I am at the time of this about 150 pounds 5’9 and quite muscular for my age. )
I was punching these dogs as hard as I could to the point my knuckles bled and now have scars from me attempting to beat the dogs away. I told my grandmother to grab my granddads shotgun as I now had full intent on killing this dogs. Luckily the lady next to us on the other side rushed out and got the dogs away before my grandmother came back. There was blood everywhere and we now took my dog inside to take care of his wounds. He was badly injured. He had a huge hole in his stomach. He also had bumped his head against the concrete and broke his paw. There was also some very concerning neck bites. We placed him in he tub and prepared to take him to the animal hospital. 
He survived the attack and made a full recovery 5,000$ later. But the mental affect of this on me was way too much and sent me overboard and still have a grudge against the dogs and I will not go into detail over that. I am seeing mental help and take meds but I needed to get this off my chest as the anniversary is today.",supital622,2019-03-04 18:09:22,5,543,53.03,43.41,73,4.83,13.92,11.23,87.29,57.46,16.21,11.97,6.81,1.29,0.18,2.95,0.74,4.24,7.55,13.26,8.29,6.26,8.47,1.47,15.47,5.71,2.58,0.37,2.58,1.66,3.68,0.74,2.76,0.18,1.47,0.37,8.84,1.1,0.37,0.74,3.5,8.66,0.92,1.1,0.92,3.13,0.37,3.68,1.47,0.18,0.18,0.92,2.39,1.66,0.92,0,0,7.73,2.03,0.74,3.13,2.03,0.37,8.47,6.45,0.92,17.13,2.39,10.31,4.79,0.37,0.92,1.84,0,0,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.5,6.08,0.18,0,0,0,1.66,0,0,1.29,1.1,0.18

&amp;#x200B;

Thought I would share some of the eternal pain I suffer through everyday, which I would love to just get off my chest. I am trying so hard to be strong and keep it together without the harmful coping methods I know so well, like the risky sex, drugs, alcohol, you know the BS. But it isn't easy and I have no support system. I have isolated myself in a way that is for the best yet here I am feeling so god damn alone. I don't know my father and my mother was extremely abusive which kind of led me into some of the trouble I got into in the past. I let it go. I don't act out in anger and I am taking better care of myself. She lives here, with me and my grandpa and she is so ill. She has schizophrenia and psychosis. Her room is next to mine and she has no clue who I am or who she is nor the year or state we may be in. She deteriorated from an abusive crazed women to a person I can barely recognize by eye who talks to herself and laughs all day. I just don't understand how my grandpa has got it in his head that I can live like this. I suffer from PSTD from, I don't want to begin the things she did and said to me growing up that I have reoccurring flashbacks of. It just continues and it is worse that I am here around here. I feel like I shouldn't feel this way and that I should ignore how I feel because my grandpa makes it seem like it is so easy and that I won't get anywhere in life if I don't do just that. Which is to drain out the pain I am feel. I want to leave and I feel weak and crazy . Can I have someone who doesn't know who I am tell me I have a right to want to get away. People say I have it good because I don't have to pay rent , that I am not like my grandma and uncle living on the streets cause I am ""spoiled"" but what I have is someone who wants control over me and to not feel alone. He doesn't love either one of us especially not my mother because he would of taken her to a psychiatrist, yet he will let her sit there because he feels ashamed that his daughter is this way.

axi2ti,"I don't know what's going on anymore, self blame (Advice?)","I'm not sure if this is the right forum for what I'm going through, but I dunno where else I can go. Over a year ago, I got out of a relationship because he would always guilt me into doing sexual things I knew I didn't want to do. He'd say stuff like 'don't you trust me?' and I felt like it's what I needed to do to be a good partner. But after every time, I'd have to hide in my bathroom for a few minutes and calm myself down from a panic attack. I was and still am full of guilt from the situation and can barely think about it without feeling disgusting. For the most part, I've kind of willed myself to stop thinking about the details but I remain hyper vigilant and paranoid that he's watching me (we still live in the same city). I've always suffered from anxiety and depression but my list of triggers has almost doubled in size, but for the most part, I can function like a normal person. 

I've found it really hard recently to keep everything straight in my head, and the fact that I still have feelings for him makes it to where I can't even take myself seriously about what happened. Maybe it was my fault after all and I'm just over exaggerating. 

I can't seem to be mad at him for anything but the few people I've confided in seem to be pretty pissed. It doesn't make sense.

axj32c,TW: violence/sexual abuse. Is it possible that my anxiety is ptsd related? I (24/f) grew up in a favela and had some life events happen to me,"Why I want insight: from the age 15-18 I tried to self-diagnose a bunch but then by 18 I felt like it was just a regular “growing up and figuring it out” phase. The one label I have identified with since then is the good ol’ “anxiety”. Everyone has it. So in a sense I have felt “normal”. I have worked through a bunch of things that I attributed to how my parents raised me and I would honestly say that I am a generally happy, positive person.

Now, here is what got me started on thinking about this: A few days ago I did coke for the first time ever (I’m not a druggie. All I have done is the somewhat regular weed and occasional alcohol). No big deal. I didn’t trip out or enjoy it. I simply felt nothing from it. I snorted my last dose of it close to 10PM. At around 3AM I tried to sleep. I was at a cheap motel and in the room next us there were some people having a party and talking a little too loud, walking in and out of the room. Sometimes it sounded like they would be walking into my room — a thought which I could easily dismiss but a feeling that I couldn’t shake. I was on full-on alert. I felt as if I was going to be “disturbed”, that something or someone would be making me get up and I was scared. The more I thought of it, the less what I felt seemed cocaine-related, and the more I could think about other times I felt the same way.

So, here is my background:
I am from a neigbourhood called Piedade, in Rio de Janeiro. Born and raised there until I was 8/9 years old. I moved with my family around Brazil until I was 15, at which point we moved to Canada. 
Rio is a dangerous (!!!), violent place. My neighbourhood was a favela. Not the worst one but a favela nevertheless. I can recall most nights falling asleep to the sounds of gunshots. I can’t really recall the sound of gunshots nowadays until I hear one. I have been caught up in the line of fire quite a few times. Most of them were on the streets and we would just stay put in corners of the house. Some of them were while I was out on the streets and had to just scoot down in the car or run and hide inside nearby stores. One of my earliest memories is of me being woken up in a hurry by my parents. They just grabbed me and my brother and took us to the bathroom. Our doors and windows were gridded and someone — or in my memory as a child, something scary — was banging on them. I honestly don’t remember much of that anymore. Just the paralyzing fear, attentiveness, confusion. What happened was that someone was getting followed by a gang to be killed. We had a big yard and this guy jumped into our property. My parents, who were outside, heard neighbours yelling to warn them and they ran inside to get us. The gang arrived, our neighbor was an ex cop, and a shootout happened all around us. But like I said, it’s mostly a feeling to me.
We left Rio when I was 8/9 and I witnessed a lot less of that type of violence. I continued to witness robberies and assaults. A lot of noisy situations. Looking back at it, robbers tend to make their presences known when they are trying to intimidate people with noise.
Anyway, that was until I was 15 and we left to come to Canada.
15 was also just about the age when my dad stopped hitting me. He had some anger bursts for no good reason.
In a few instances in Brazil, and once in Canada, I was groped very indiscreetly.
Then in Canada, once I was 18/19 I was living alone in a basement. I got out of my shower, heard some loud bangs on my door. I froze. Some people burst through, looked at me, ran away. I was shocked but still managed to call the cops right away. I just couldn’t think properly enough to explain it to them in as much detail as they wanted.

So here I am today. I have recurring nightmares quite often. I would say I could go a week having nightmares only. Someone usually dies in my dreams. Most times I am killed in it, other times I am the one killing. Occasionally, in these dreams, someone else will die in front of me. In real life when I hear loud noises my mind freezes. If someone is talking to me after a noisy disturbance I can “go with it” but about 30 seconds to a few minutes later I have to ask them to rewind because I wasn’t “there” anymore. I have really, really, really light sleep. I feel tired all the time. I don’t like spending nights alone at home. Sometimes not even days. If I do, I keep checking on doors, windows and peep behind curtains. If I’m alone I barely sleep or sleep super late until it’s light out. I don’t feel comfortable in loud places (unless there’s rythm/music).

Anyway, like I said in the beginning, I am still a generally happy person. My anxiety, other than what I just described above, is not a big part of my life anymore. But also, what I call anxiety I have usually attributed to that “worrying” feeling that I will fail or something will go wrong because of me and my decisions (money, school). So, I guess I am wondering if what I described is something like ptsd or if I am just being dramatic and trying to label myself again. But also, part of me feels as if I have made huge progress with my anxiety and that it shed a light into something hidden deeper — I have made peace with the things I used to blame for my anxiety, yet some feelings of uneasiness linger on. I was wondering if I could have ptsd to any extent (none or mild to moderate maybe?). 

Please tell me what you think. Personal experiences relating to it and even not relating to it would be appreciated. I’m obviously not going to use your opinions as diagnosis but it would help to have a frame of reference.

axnbds,I feel like there are 3-versions of myself,"It's so very complicated and I don't mean in a DID way either. My PTSD is due to a single traumatic event at age 9. I cannot remember much about myself and personality before then. My memory is messed up. And then there's just ""me"". But I've discovered recently that I have dissociative amnesia shortly after the trauma that lasted for months. I've always felt confused by my memories because they seemed ""off"". I finally figured out that it's because things are not in a chronological order and because a huge chunk is missing, so my therapist said that I've created false memories to make up for the missing parts which is why my memory always felt off around that time. 

I feel like my trauma is related to another version of me aka 9 year old me which is in a constant state of distress. When I talk or think about the trauma, it's like I become that person again.

axom2r,Tips for distractions/coping mechanisms to stop abusing alcohol?,"Hi everyone.

I’ve never exactly had a healthy relationship with alcohol but until recently (like, last summer) it’s been under control. Now that I am dealing with a lot of trauma processing and symptoms keep flaring I am really losing my fucking shit. (fyi I am 34.)

When I drink with friends I am okay because I am not drinking to cope. When I drink alone, I drink to get very drunk on purpose, to deal with PTSD-related anxiety/reliving and the restlessness and the pain I feel. Obviously this is alcohol abuse. It’s usually only 1/2 to 3/4 bottle of wine or 1/4 bottle of whiskey. 

But lately when I drink I drink more than I used to and faster; I might drink a 1/3 to 1/2 a fifth of whiskey or an entire bottle of wine pretty quickly and blackout, then pass out! One time I missed something I was supposed to do because I fell asleep for three hours. This had never happened before and it’s scary. It’s happened maybe a few times over the past couple months. 

So I dunno if I’m an alcoholic or just have a coping problem but I need to stop drinking, at least alone. But the thing is that I don’t want to sit around and drink all day; that’s not my issue. I do have hobbies and I do go for long walks and see movies and friends, but I live alone and eventually I have to come home and be with myself. 

The anxiety and restlessness and all that really especially gets to me at night when it’s quiet and I’m alone, especially if I want to do something creative and feel too paralyzed to do it. That’s when I am most likely to cave and go to the store—at night alone with my thoughts. 

It used to help me get creative work done at night by relaxing me a little, but not anymore; now I drink too much too fast and don’t get any art done anyway, so it’s exhausted that purpose and I have no more practical excuses to do it.

I’m considering if a dog (either a support animal or just a calm breed) might be a good idea, as I have a cat and cuddling him can help some, but that’s a big decision.

If you abuse alcohol or became an alcoholic due to PTSD, how do you prevent yourself from caving in when your symptoms are severe?

axomxh,Do I have ptsd?sorry of this os offensive for some people,"I just moved countries last year due to my dad having something like cancer and needing better medication,so I was under alot of emotional stress and I was at a point in my life where I was kind of suicidal.

I changed schools and was introduced to a subject that I never took in my country(ICT)back home all we used to do was play online games,I was basically computer illeterate.Im usually a straight A student but My first term there I got an F.I was very upset and frustrated though I gave myself a pass since the shit was extremely card to me(making excel spreadsheets with codes and other complicated stuff)well the next term,which was the last term.I studied extremely hard and was at the ICT teacher's desk every single day.

Exam day comes and Im feeling extremely anxious,my stomach was in knots,though i kept trying to calm myself.I do the paper and the question before the last confused me and my asshole of a teacher was no help and didnt want to answer anything I ask.I start shaking and feel dizzy and almost about to cry,begging help from the students sitting next to me,and they obviously dont partialy due to them not wanting to risk failing heloing a kid they dont know.

Ever since that day everytime i sit an ICT exam i get a panic attack and my hand keeps shaking and get uncontrollable diarrhoea,funnily enough this only happens in ICT.

During ICT tests i score full marks but i fuck up in exams due to this,I honestly feel like next time I'll take an ICT exam I will fall unconscious.The feeling is too overwhelming and it just happened to me today.Sorry if this isnt the right sub or if it its offensive because of how stupid it is,but words seriously cant describe the anxiety,panic and freaking out I go through.Its so stupid yet affects me greatly.Even thinking about it makes my stomach turn into knots.I apologize for  my bad english its my second language.

And yes I have tried taking private lessons though only i groups because one on one turoring is too expensive and it isnt helping because everytime he tries to test me I panic again.",ContinuousGas,2019-03-05 10:47:21,1,407,31.96,8.45,95.53,1,58.14,18.92,93.12,54.79,17.69,13.02,11.79,0.25,0,0.25,0.74,4.67,5.41,10.32,7.37,7.62,8.35,2.21,17.69,4.42,0.98,0.74,1.23,1.47,9.34,1.97,7.37,3.19,2.21,1.23,4.67,0.25,0,0,0.49,14.25,2.46,2.7,1.23,3.19,2.46,3.69,1.47,0,0,1.47,2.7,1.23,1.23,0.25,0,7.62,1.23,1.72,3.19,1.97,0.74,5.65,8.85,0.49,14.74,1.72,5.41,7.86,4.42,0.49,0.25,0.49,0,0.25,1.47,0.98,0,0.25,0.25,0,8.35,3.93,2.7,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0.49,0.98,0

axst29,Advice for telling conservative family?,"I was raped two years ago, and it has been affecting me more lately. My triggers are getting worse, and I want to make a positive difference for survivors. 
I want to open an honest dialogue about what has happened to me for two reasons— I want others to feel less alone, and I want to change the way we talk about sexual assault in our society. 

In order to do this, I would have to tell my parents. I was raised in a conservative, Catholic family. I know my parents would love and support me (and feel disappointed I didn’t tell them right away) but I also know myself. I don’t want to tell them my story for my own sake; I want to tell them what happened to me because I want my parents to stop supporting Trump. I don’t want them to vote for someone who has assaulted other women. I want them to vote for someone who supports and empowers women. I know that my father will never stop supporting Trump. I’m worried that telling him my story will cause tension and hatred between us. However, it is already there a bit, because I know how he would react. 

Should I continue to tell my family about this, in hopes that they will at least be more aware of what women have to endure? Should I wait until I am at a point where I can fully accept my parents’ support of Donald Trump? What advice do you have when it comes to talking about it with parents and family members?

tl;dr - I want to talk about my PTSD from being raped, but I don’t know if I should tell my parents. I want them to stop supporting trump but realistically I don’t think they will, even after hearing my story.

She suspects I may also have PTSD from childhood trauma. I didn't pay it too much attention until a few nights ago when I had to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, and it took me a while because I was afraid my husband would wake up and start yelling at me. My husband is a nice guy and thinking about it rationally I know that my husband would never yell at me for getting up. I've reacted this way around my husband before and each time I've nevet gotten yelled at yet I still react in fear. I never made the connection in my head that I've always had to walk around eggshells with my dad growing up.  If my dad wasn't in a good mood the simplest things would result in an angry outburst.

axurt8,DAE lack ambition or direction career and education wise? Feeling kind of ashamed.,"I don't have a career goal or objective. Any job that is ethical and not stressful for me does it. Clerical work, solitary work or working from home is fine for me. No dreams of being anything or anyone in particular, not right now at least. I do well in college, but it's not my passion. I don't have passions. There are things I enjoy doing, but no job or subject truly excites me anymore. 

I feel sad and ashamed about this. A major trauma (among many following) happened to me in college. I had dreams and they died. Just gone. I've tried to have ambition like I used to for working and it's not the same. I feel like my brain is always working overtime to help me do basic things. Anything too mentally taxing or chsllenging and I feel like I'm short circuiting.

Manual labor and organizing have become cathartic for me. They weren't before but they are now. Perhaps because I focus my energy on my body and not my mind with physical tasks.

I don't like to tell anyone I feel like this, but this is how I feel right now. And I don't know if it will change.

axv8qs,PTSD &amp; Running,"Hi all,

So I was diagnosed with PTSD about 4 years ago after a traumatic incident and was really not doing well. After some real lows, I found running. I was not an athletic or fit person at ALL prior to this, but my anxiety and flashbacks were such that all I wanted to do was get up and run. I would start at a normal pace and gradually run faster and faster until I would just run as fast as I could, and I always felt much better afterwards. This really helped with my PTSD, and I highly recommend running to anyone struggling—for me, it was life-saving. 

Anyways, I got pretty fit from that and through running and therapy, over time my more intrusive symptoms subsided such that I could resume my normal activities. I gradually started running less and less and now I rarely run at all. I really miss it, but struggle because the act of running reminds me so much of how I felt when my PTSD was bad...I really wish I could get back into running because I loved it and found it so emotionally soothing, but it’s been about 2 years since I have actually run because it reminds me of my PTSD so much. Has anyone else encountered this problem?

ay04sh,Living in a fog,"I have been through it all it seems. Maybe more so than others, but surely not the worst either. I've tried therapy, which seems to only make things worse. Talking about all of the terrible things that have happened only makes me think about them more than I already do. I have flashbacks often of past trauma, night terrors, seizures sometimes. I try to feel something, anything, and often find myself lacking any feeling at all for those memories. My scars run deep, and every new wound just adds a layer of scar tissue, one on top of the other. It feels like that scar tissue is impenetrable, and I can't shake the haze of apathy. There are times when I think about all of the things I've been through and experienced and I break down and cry. Then I feel guilty, why am I crying? These things would not have happened if it weren't for poor decision making on my part. I hate feeling that I am a victim. I hate feeling sorry for myself. But more so than that, I hate feeling like I am trapped in a state of numbness. Why can I not feel something for those things that have happened? I relive the events over and over, but I can't feel anything. Even as they were happening, I felt nothing. I picked myself up and kept moving until the next thing happened, then did it all over again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have finally found someone that I love, and that genuinely loves me too. Someone good, someone whole, and someone who isn't as fucked up as I am. I want to be healthy, for him and for myself. I find that all of the trauma has made me bitter and cold towards people, even him. I don't want to be this way forever, but I am at a loss on what to do or where to even start. If I could just feel something, deal with those feelings, I may be able to move on. Maybe it hurts too much to feel it. I'm not sure. I have no clue how to fix this. I guess I always thought if I just keep moving forward, these things will never catch up to me. I was so wrong. They haunt me. Each and everyday, I am cursed with living through the events I tried so hard to forget. I don't want to think about it, I want to think about my future. So why is this so hard?  

&amp;#x200B;

Each day feels like a fog that grows thicker and thicker. The lines between reality and memory become blurry. I often times don't know where I am or who is with me. Am I losing my mind? It certainly feels that way. Is it possible to come back from this? Is all there is to life this never ending hell that I am in? It's all too much for me to bare, but undoubtedly I will continue to live with it until I change something. What is it that causes me to be this way? Everyone goes through their own shit, deals with it, moves on. Why can't I move on?",notsurehowimalive,2019-03-06 07:37:43,5,539,15.98,4.77,97.89,1,11.98,10.58,94.25,64.75,24.49,12.8,11.69,0,0,0.37,0.74,11.69,2.97,14.66,9.65,7.98,7.42,2.97,21.89,4.82,2.97,2.41,0.19,3.9,6.12,1.3,4.82,0.56,1.3,1.11,3.15,0,0,0,0.37,21.89,5.94,2.23,1.86,5.38,3.71,4.64,4.27,0,0,3.9,2.23,0.19,1.48,0.19,0,4.64,0.37,1.3,2.04,0.37,1.11,3.71,16.14,1.11,13.17,2.23,5.57,5.75,0,0.19,0,0.19,0.19,0,0.56,0.56,0,0,0,0,17.07,6.68,5.19,0,0.74,1.48,0,0,0,2.23,0,0.74

ay2088,I was a victim of a disgusting monster for 4 years,"When I was 6 I lost my virginity. My window would be open every now and again and I would wake up without clothes on. one day I found blood and my mom assumed my period had started...before my older sisters (3 years older) but of course I didnt actually start my period until a couple years later. This went undiscovered by my parents until I informed them years later. 

When I was a sophomore in high school, I started talking to one of my sisters old friends because he reached out and wanted to invite me to go for runs with him. His name was John. He was 9 years older then me. I would come to find out years later that he took my sisters virginity after getting her drunk when she was in middle school, offically told me that ""I was too drunk to remember, I dont know if I did or not"", but my sister remembers it all.

It started as a friendship, typical grooming and pampering, but it spiralled into drunk anger and one sided control. He would monitor where I was at all times, downloaded an app on my phone that could tell him where I am ""for my safety"" and I believed him of course because he was a Paramedic for a living. I was manipulated to stay at his home every night for weeks at a time, my excuse to my mom was I was at a friends house. I was able to keep this a secret for 4 years. I started restricting which friends I could text and hang out with until it was just him. (I was able to reconnect with those friends now and I have a reunion photo from last month ❤)

He convinced me that we were soul mates and that I was so mature of my age, that's why we were together. 

I tried breaking it off with him when I found out a guy in my class was gonna ask me out, I told him I wanted a normal high school experience before staying with him. He was bipolar and had extreme anger issues so this didnt go over well. At this point I didnt think we were officially together though, I was only 16. I starting dating the guy from my class but John wouldn't let up. He would insist on taking me to school every morning, driving me to work just to cry on me. I stopped getting rides from him but he would show up to my work just to tell me how much I fucked up and that he better for me, this dudes a pussy and I'll regret this. So I left the dude and got back with John... I was so convinced he was still my soul mate, what the fuck little me? He also told me at one point that he was gonna resize his grandmas old ring to give to me as a promise ring. 

1 red flag was when he wanted to teach me how to drive but he wanted to do it at night and have me ride in his lap while I steered the truck...this led to him getting exciting and this is where the fucked up parts start. I hated when he touched me. I was repulsed by him but he convinced me there was something wrong with me. ""Its not a relationship if we dont have sex, then were just roommates"" echoed everyday. ""I have anger issues because you don't let me get out my frustration in bed, I would be just a better boyfriend if you just sucked my dick every once in a while"". I started googling what could be wrong with me, I deformed my view of myself which would ruin me for life. I chalked it up to being Asexual. He laughed at me. Told me that tumblrina bullshit and I just hate him.

I offically moved in with him when I was 17. I was still in high school at the time. We fought every single day. He would throw parties every weekend and invite our friends over to get everyone piss drunk, ""parties not over until you're sick"". I cant enjoy any alcohol the same. He would go out with other medics to the bar to get shit face drunk while I waited in the car for hours at a time so I could drive him home. He would vomit everywhere, on himself, the car, the bed. I was so tired of it but I convinced myself that I loved him and I cant leave. 
Since the public couldn't know about our relationship,  he was openly flirt and date other women, mainly a girl that his bestfriend was very much into. He convinced me I was a jealous bitch and I was selfish, but he was later confess he did this because jealousy seemed to be the only emotion he could get out of me those days, he stopped trying to just make me happy.

He pulled guns on my friends to ""protect me"", hes threatened his own life if I left, he wouldn't even let me shower by myself because it was the one chance he got to have me naked and force himself on me.
This got too much for me and I told myself that the only options I have are to stay or use the shotgun to get out. So many nights I would just picture my death and freedom. But it didnt have to come to that, I ran away when I was 18 or 19, stayed with a friend eventually moved 2,000 miles away, where I met my husband, someone who genuinely cares for me and showed me what love really is. 

i was diagnosed with PTSD but i have a hard time coming to terms with it. I tried CBT and only showed up for 2 meetings and ghosted the therapist. I'm still trying to get help but I sabotage myself everytime. I'm trying to meet with a therapist again today, well see how it goes.

ay3gaf,How to help my SO(f24)[Canada]?,"Hi /r/PTSD, first time visitor here. 

My GF has recently been given a definitive diagnosis of PTSD after several runarounds with different doctors/psychiatrists and I'm looking for pointers on how to help alleviate any pressures or triggers for her, and maybe help her symptoms improve, if possible. 

She's been the victim of sexual assaults on two different occasions and her dad was physically abusive when she and her siblings were young(he was FOB at the time and has softened since, not that I'm excusing him - his actions affect her to this day). On top of this there is a history of depression in her family, which she seems to have inherited, so her moods can be very dark even when she's not triggered. It's hard to know what's what she's suffering from.

She's been trying different anti-depressants since she was 19, when she started having trouble with school. About 2 years ago she admitted to being suicidal after her previous relationship ended(we had met but weren't a couple yet). She was taken in and seen by a panel of psychiatrists/doctors who asked her loads of questions and then released her, not really doing anything or giving her any info - she says it was a horrible experience. Her family doctor has sent her to a few different specialists since, all who do an interview with her before bouncing her back to family doctor saying they're not qualified. 

The most recent doctor, a CBT specialist, listened to her about how fed up she was with the lack of progress, he looked through her previous files and interviewed some of the professionals she'd previously seen and was able to find that she'd been given a PTSD diagnosis, which is a step in the right direction, but as a CBT specialist he's not qualified for PTSD so he shunted her back to her doctor. So we're back to waiting for her doctor to find someone who's qualified to help her. We've made progress finally but it's been a pain in the arse.

She's in college for the third time now, after dropping out twice from different courses. For the first time, yesterday and today, she's had trouble leaving the house to go to her new course. Completing school is very important to her but she's so debilitated she can't get out of the bed/chair to do anything, and I'm in work so I can't give physical comfort/encouragement. She's just sitting, stuck to the spot by panic/sadness. When it's happened before I've asked questions about where the sadness/panic comes from and she says she doesn't know - which makes it hard for me to give her any kind of solace other than that I love her and am there for her. I want to help more but I can't think of anything else that could help and I'm afraid the pattern that's stopped her from sticking out college before will happen again.   

She's on Wellbutrin for the day and Seroquel for the night. I'm not delighted about the latter because it's so heavy but it does the job so I'm not saying anything...

I support her, I try to be there for her, I try to be emotionally present and not fatigued with the constant roadblocks. I try to vet media for content that could trigger her and I keep an eye on her in social situations in case I see her start to fade/get triggered.. I'm fine with it even if it's hard sometimes.

Is there anything I'm not doing/could be doing/should stop doing? 
Thank you.",1890s_kid,2019-03-06 12:24:18,0,610,32.74,72.79,10.9,11.06,23.46,18.2,93.11,59.84,19.34,14.1,3.61,0.49,0.16,9.84,0,5.25,5.25,15.25,12.3,6.39,7.38,2.3,21.64,4.75,2.95,2.62,1.15,1.64,4.59,1.64,2.79,0.82,0.33,0.98,16.72,0.82,0.16,9.02,1.15,13.93,1.97,2.3,1.31,4.26,0.33,5.25,2.95,1.15,0.82,0.82,3.44,0.33,2.62,0.16,0.16,8.36,3.28,1.97,2.95,0.49,0.82,6.72,13.11,0.33,13.93,1.15,4.59,8.69,3.44,0.49,0.82,0.16,0,0.16,0.49,0.16,0.33,0,0,0,18.03,4.43,3.44,0,0,0.33,0,0.66,0,6.07,0.98,2.13

ay5d8q,How to get better,"I've heard that invasive thoughts, memories, flashbacks etc. are your subconscious trying to process what happened to you and that it means you still have stuff to work through.

&amp;#x200B;

If this is true it means there is stuff I still need to accept, or move on from somehow. However, I do not want to accept certain aspects of it as I am worried it will forever taint my worldview. For instance,one thing I will always find hard to accept is the implicit involvement of those around me, by doing nothing to help me at the time. Certain aspects of what happened were probably traumatic for them to be around themselves, perhaps they didn't understand the gravity of the situation as they were groomed by him to a certain extent as well, why is it their responsibility to help me to begin with?

ay5mfq,Self-Soothing Tips?,"For approximately 5 years of my childhood (6-11) my best friend's brother decided he would prefer to molest me instead of her. As a result, she became abusive in other ways. Their mother played a role in keeping it quiet and encouraging some behaviors that I honestly cannot allow myself to think about.

Long story short, my childhood memories are spotty at best, and what I do remember is fucking awful. I can't remember my primary abuser's name or face, hell I didn't even remember she had a brother until I was 21. Because I have no legal leg to stand on whatsoever, I obviously never pressed charges or made formal accusations.

There's the backstory, for the most part. My current problem is that I'm pretty sure he messaged me on a dating app today. I can't confirm if it's him without asking my parents if they remember his name, and I prefer not to talk about this with them. I've been fighting off flashbacks for the past 5 hours. I'm exhausted. I just want to be held and comforted but I have nobody to turn to right now.

Does anyone have tips on how to self-soothe? I drove to my safe/happy place and I'm cuddling a blanket and listening to music, but the feelings are coming in waves and i can't stay here all night.

ay7rhe,Invalid trauma = invalid PTSD,"So I've been discussing some events from my past in therapy, and my therapist has been referring to them as trauma. But I wasn't in a war, I wasn't raped, I didn't almost die. What I went through doesn't fit any classifications for trauma, but it left me traumatized, I think.

Am I really traumatized if my so-called ""trauma"" wasn't even that serious? Am I just exaggerating my symptoms? Are the flashbacks, the anxiety, the buried emotions so obscure and painful I don't even know what they are, all in my head?

Is it normal to feel so haunted by these memories all the time? Is it normal to be unable to listen to certain music, do certain things I love, even say a specific name, because of how painful the memories are?

I hate that I'm in so much pain but I can't put a name on it. If I could call it PTSD, maybe I'd at least feel somewhat understood and validated.

Now I'm panicking...,"So a few weeks ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/CongratsLikeImFive/comments/ategdp/i_finally_stood_up_to_the_man_who_abused_and/) in another subreddit about how I finally stood up to my abuser turned stalker. I'm still really proud of myself. It's been 10 years that he's been a part of my life and dictated so much of how I lived my life.

Now, I just feel panicked a lot. It's a different type of panic than it was before though. He was such a big part of my daily life and now it's gone. I mean, sure, he's still there. He didn't disappear, but by standing up for myself, I finally broke the hold he had on me. Now that I'm not spending so so much of my day focused on him, my brain is just...a mess. I've had a couple little memories of the abuse resurface (I have a lot of blank spots from that time) - nothing big, just little things. It kind of scares me that I'm starting to remember things though. What if I remember something I really didn't want to? I know I can't control what my brain decides it's safe to remember. I know I can only take it one day at a time. I'm just really scared. I'm not even sure of what I'm scared of at this point. I know how I feel when I'm scared of him and this isn't it....

ay99bq,"I can't stop watching ""Leaving Neverland"" (possible TW)","Despite my better judgement, I decided to watch the new documentary that was mainly first-person graphic accounts of Michael Jackson's victims. And I knew that things about abuse tend to put me in a bad place, but I decided to stay up and watch all four hours until 2 am, when I had to go to work the next morning. Then at work, I read as much as I could about it when we weren't busy. Then when I got home I ate junk food, rewatched the documentary, fell asleep, woke up, and watched the Oprah special about the victims. And today I've just been searching every website to see if I could find more information about it and rewatching interviews. I managed to leave the house and go to yoga, but towards the end of the practice I couldn't stop worrying that the instructor was going to touch me. And then I went home and watched more interviews about Michael Jackson. I told myself I would work on applying to jobs tonight, but I feel way too distracted.   


Does anyone have any experience with these kinds of obsessive tendencies? I'm very moved by the victims, and it's really validating to see someone talk about their abuse.

ayaad4,Physical ailments and PTSD?,"I’ll try to make this as short as possible. 

My brother has been sick for about 7 years and has gone to every doctor imaginable looking for a cure to his illness. He has gone to at least 500 doctors across the US (no joke) and has had every test you can think of. The thing is, about every test has come back normal. We can’t figure out what’s wrong. 

His symptoms started as being unable to eat, brain fog, and fatigue. About 2 years into him being sick he started thinking something was wrong with his abdomen. One day he was pushing around in his abdomen area and hurt himself. Ever since then he swears he pushed something out of place in that area. His symptoms have also gotten worse. 

He now barely eats because he says when he does he feels severely sick. He claims his blood sugar dips into the 40’s sometimes after he eats. He’s so skinny and malnourished it’s probably making it worse. There’s a lot of other symptoms too but eating is the main one. 

Anyways my brother was in the army right before he got sick but was never the same when he got out. We want to believe “there’s something out of place in his abdomen” but it doesn’t make any sense, and every test says he’s normal/healthy. My family and I think he has PTSD but we’re not sure, and he sure as hell doesn’t think he has it. He hates my parents so much and blames them for every thing wrong with his health. He wants them to help him but as soon as they try, he writes them off as incompetent and says they aren’t doing anything?!

I’m so lost and don’t know what to do to help. Or even if he’d accept my help. Does this sound anything like PTSD?

ayg9kn,Bad immune system from PTSD?,"This is kind of random, but my immune system is absolutely shitty and I'm wondering if part of that is from my PTSD. I don't usually get really sick, I just get sick super often (at least one cold a month during flu season).

It got bad right when I broke things off with the girl who abused me for most of my childhood (ended up in the hospital with pneumonia - everyone in my family was sick a lot that winter, but I was then only one who got it that bad). It got better for a bit - I had a best friend I was very close to, and my PTSD was definitely there, though maybe not as severely (it is hard to remember, honestly). That friendship ended badly. Then my chronic illnesses got worse as I started college (I have endometriosis and PCOS. Endo can have an effect on your immune system, btw). And then last year, I dated a guy who ended up assaulting me and dramatically worsened my PTSD. 

So now I just feel like I'm sick all the time. I was before the assault, but it's continuing and maybe a bit worse (I just had bronchitis for the first time).

I work in the back warehouse of a steel plant that has a ton of employees and in turn alot of people fighting of dumb shit. 

While me and another co-worker were talking someone else came in with a ski mask on and his hands in his hoody pocket staring at us walking forward not saying a word. 

So I slowly start moving into position for a fight and he moves one hand from his front hoody to behind him and underneath his clothing. 

I stick my hand in my pocket and pull back the hammer on my gun. He flings his hands forward and starts laughing asking if he looked cool.

ayjhvi,Feeling Like I Don’t Matter to My Partners? (TW: Rape/Abuse) (NSFW),"Hi all. I have to have a tough conversation with my partner this weekend about how we have sex. Basically he only penetrates me and shows disgust, hesitation, or outright disinterest at manually or orally pleasuring me. (From what it’s worth, he shows similar emotions when I discuss manually or orally pleasuring him.) He doesn’t even look at my vulva. Because of this, I don’t ever orgasm when we have sex, while he always gets his. It makes me feel used, and I’m trying to work up the courage to tell him so.

The problem is, I’ve never had sex, either casually or in a relationship, where I wasn’t there for the other person’s pleasure. I’ve never orgasmed with a partner.

My abusive ex-girlfriend told me I was disgusting, and she was waiting for a better person to come along. Both of my rapists used me as a toy while thinking of their ex-girlfriends. A man once straight up told me my orgasm didn’t matter and I shouldn’t look for one. My last boyfriend accused me of being too uptight or “too small” because he couldn’t penetrate me.

This parade of cruel partners has left me heartbroken and numb to the point where I can’t masturbate or orgasm without watching porn. Sex is no longer interesting, loving, or fun to me; thoughts of someone having sex with me causes dissociation or leaves me in tears. I’m convinced my current boyfriend is just further proof that my body exists for the pleasure of others, and that I should stop deluding myself that he or anyone else will treat me well.

I’m having frequent anxiety attacks over this upcoming conversation to the point where I can’t focus on my graduate classes or my midterm tomorrow. Any advice on how to broach this topic with him, or even just some comfort/support while I wait,

Is there any advice out there, I would gladly take any. I had issues with fully understanding her situation, but I really want to be able to know what to do when she gets into a bad headspace and everything. Everyday is so sad for her and I’m not sure how to be there for her. 

I listen to everything she says and give her validation but I’m not really sure what to do after that. I’ll make sure she’s not in pain, be there in person when she needs me, and everything I could try.

aymheu,Can't have sex with my boyfriend,"I have a very serious problem guys and I feel trapped into it. So, it all starts 5 years ago. I met a guy on grindr and decided to go to his place. A decision I will regret every second of my life. Once I went there he wasn't alone. There were 5 other guys. I won't get into details but I was raped, tortured, beaten to a point that they broke my jaw from kicking me, burned and then left in the woods drowning in my own blood.


















Back to today. I have a wonderful boyfriend who loves and cherishes me. But I am scarred. Both on the in and outside. Every time we are about to have sex I get these panic attacks and just can't go through with it. I have been in therapy for years but can't seem to get over this irrational problem. Every touch takes me back to that night and I just freak out and get totally crazy. He loves me a lot but I feel like I am limiting him. Should I keep him into a relationship where I am not sexually available to him? Is that even fair to him? He is a wonderful and loving man and I don't want to lose him but I feel like he also has the right to be with someone who can make him happy both physically and emotionally.

aymos0,Diagnosed with PTS today,"Okay so this is long but here we go. The doctor explained the difference between PTS and PTSD so I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this but I couldn't find a PTS subreddit.

I had a phone appointment with my doctor earlier today with a lot of support and encouragement from my boyfriend to get checked out after years of abuse from my ex-husband. My bf was worried it was full blown PTSD but we found out it's PTS specifically. Divorce related stress from the beginning of the week has caused nightmares and I've had episodes of shaking, sweating, heart racing etc from flashes of fights that pop into my head randomly since separating from my ex.  

I'm across the country from my family so I don't have many people I'm comfortable talking to except over the phone. I'm trying not to put this on my guy too much so had to vent. He's been amazing, he holds me after the nightmares and through the episodes if I want, reminds me I'm safe now, tells me I'll never get hit again, all the right things but it's hard seeing him so concerned.  

He offered to cut our time in NY short, said we could fly out tonight but I'd feel selfish for taking him up on that because the whole reason we're out here is so he can take care of some stuff in the east coast office. He'll be back with a late dinner and bourbon soon - I stayed home to try to process this diagnosis, he has enough on his plate with running his businesses so I don't want to pile on even though he says that's why he's here. 

He and his little sister sat with me during the appointment and she let me know she's there for me to talk to if I wanted when they get back from picking up food. She even offered to stay with me or go get the food so my guy could stay with me but I needed some time alone. She's a couple years older than me but we get along really well so I can't figure out why I'm nervous to talk to her about it. 

I'm trying to figure out what the next steps for me would be. The doctor said it normally takes about a month to get through it but might be longer since I was abused for so long. He suggested I find a support group out here and there are tons, I'm just hesitant to go. 

So far we all sat and watched some new episodes of stuff on Hulu today after I found out. They were really understanding when I told them I didn't know what to say at that point and I just needed to veg. Now I'm sitting on his balcony watching life pulse through the city while I smoke some hookah until they get back. 

What were your first steps after being diagnosed? What advice do you have for someone who's recently been diagnosed? Also, any advice on how to get an appetite back? I have my fav food coming but can't get hungry even though I haven't been eating much the past few days.",ThinKitten1219,2019-03-07 21:37:29,2,546,33.01,42.72,89.08,20.25,22.75,11.72,94.69,60.26,19.6,15.2,9.16,1.28,0.37,3.66,0.73,4.4,4.76,15.93,10.07,8.42,7.88,1.83,21.06,4.58,1.83,1.83,0.18,2.93,4.58,2.01,2.38,0.92,0.55,0.18,12.45,0.73,0.73,1.1,3.85,14.65,3.11,1.65,2.38,3.11,0.92,4.95,2.01,0.55,1.1,0.37,3.66,0.73,1.47,0,1.47,6.96,2.56,0.73,1.1,2.2,0.37,4.95,13.74,1.1,17.22,2.38,8.42,7.69,0.92,0.73,0.55,0.18,0,0,1.1,0,0.37,0.18,0.18,0,11.72,3.66,1.83,0,0,0.55,0,0.37,0,5.31,0,0
aymxec,Is it possible to have PTSD from a person?... help,"I remember when it happened, it was caused by a person’s lie and I felt like something in my brain snapped, I felt so much panic I thought I was going to die. I feel silly saying this but this is the truth. 

Fast forward I obsessed over this issue and would be paranoid day and night scared that I’d find out other lies.. scared to death. I hated remembering that moment for the life of me, I hated so much, so much fear of feeling that way again.. or living that moment again.  

I was near this person every single day for years.. and every single day I had a ridiculous amount of stress.


I found out I had untreated major depression for a while, I’ve finally started to treat it and feel it slow down.. then I noticed that when I am away from that person I feel so much better, my anxiety goes away, I feel happier and more in control. Then when they approach me I swear I feel the stress arriving, anxious and just miserable, I feel that I want to stay away from them.

Is it possible that a person is my PTSD..? I’m confused.

What forms of therapy have worked best for you guys? I've already been recommended EMDR, which I'm excited and nervous to do. I also want to be tested or evaluated for bipolar, personality disorders, codependency, and any forms of mental illness that my specialist recommends. It might be a bit overkill but I have fantastic insurance right now, and I just want to be on the safe side. I want to know if something's up with me.

ayo78o,Just wanted to share some progress/a happy thing,"So I've been with my girlfriend for over 7 years now. Honestly, at the beginning, it was rough. Neither of us were in a very healthy place at all. We've been through so much together and learned so much since then, and I've got my ptsd diagnosis and treatment. She never underwent therapy or anything though, until recently. I was so proud of her for finally doing it!

But I always had this worry in the back of my mind, that when she finally started therapy and working on her issues, that she would start to see me for the toxic asshole that I am (Or more accurately, was at the beginning). But the weirdest thing happened.

After a couple months of therapy, she sat me down and said she needed to tell me something. Here it is, I thought. This is the end of the line. She finally sees how toxic and gross I am. But what she shared instead, is that after a lot of soul searching and talking it over with her therapist, she's decided that she's changed her mind about marriage and kids, and would now like both (She was always against them from the start). I was surprised, but in a good way. Wow, what a great moment of growth for her! I congratulated her and thought to myself, too bad she's about to see me for the fraud I really am and it won't be with me!

Well, the next day in the car on the way to the grocery store, she brought it up again. I thought she was just excited and wanted to share her feelings with me. But it turns out, I didn't get what she was trying to say.

She wants to have kids **with me!**

She wants to marry **me!**

She changed her mind about these things specifically because of our relationship and how much I mean to her.

Needless to say I'm just overwhelmed, and slightly confused. I feel like I gained some perspective that I'm not as bad as I see myself. And also that I have the best partner in the world.

aypvdk,Just Found Out,"So yesterday was I guess what you would call a breakthrough for me in thearpy.

For the past month or so I have had a few family and friends say they think I have ptsd which I ignored heavily cause of that ""what do they know right?"" However my sister-in-law was one of them and her dad and older brother were combat vets and suffered ptsd badly so when she said it it took me off balance and I guess triggered me.

Well then Wednesday I had to follow up with my PCD on bipolar meds and we discussed how I feel like I've had set backs dealing with my depression that still persisted through the medication and even he said it sounded alot like I had ptsd.

Well I went to my normal therapist session yesterday and it felt different from the start. He was delving deeper into things I was saying more so then the content itself and finally mentioned ptsd twice which took me off guard again and got me flustered.

He caught me lying twice and I guess cornered me for lack of a better words and in a revelation or release I'm not sure which finally drove the nail home that I suffer from PTSD.

A huge chunk of the issues lays with my dad and how he was physically and mentally abusive to me, my brothers, and my mother who left when I was 2. I caught alot of the mental.

It hurt alot to finally admit it to myself and, that I felt very exposed.

Even now I still feel hypervigilant but I know where it comes from now.

My biggest worry is now that I know I'm afraid it will hurt to much and well make things worse and lead somewhere I dont wanna go to.

Sorry for the length I just felt I had to kinda tell someone or some people to I guess vent about it.

The last question is how do you guys cope with it? How do you handle or deal with your triggers now that you are aware of it? I've stayed non violent about it this whole time(alot of temper flares and screaming and yelling but no physical violence) but, I'm afraid some triggers may make.me that way now that I feel kinda vulnerable.

ayq46n,Making connections between trauma and triggers.,"I wanted to start by saying I do see a therapist, and I wanted to explore this with her. Should I wait or are there things I can do on my own? We don't meet for another week and I just can't wait. 

However, I have some strange triggers that I can't really connect to an experience. (I was recently diagnosed, so this is all new to me.) For the longest time, I thought I was just awkward but I'm starting to see it's probably more than that. 

The most recent one is Male attention. (Besides my husband!) It doesn't even have to be direct. Theres a rumor going on around work that a coworker had made a comment about my appearance. I am irrationally TERRIFIED about this. I can't calm down while I'm here until I know he's gone for the day. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder and I'm particularly jumpy. Hes a nice guy and respectful of the fact I am married. Has not even said a word to me about it. Which is why I am so frustrated with myself. I just CANNOT settle down, partly because I just don't understand why.

ayqhip,Terrified of what a therapist would say to me about this all,"I'll leave this as a trigger warning for a few things




To keep this part quick and simple, my family life is terrible and quite terrifying, to say the least, and I'm sure this has played a very large part, but that's not quite what I'm wanting to bring up.
I don't want to call this PTSD, no, definitely not.
I feel as though this can never be on that ""level"" I suppose, in a way.
I know things like this can't be on a scale, but that's just what it feels like.
I feel like if I were to go to a therapist, I'll have my fears that this all was just me overreacting, confirmed, which isn't a bad thing you know, but just for this, I just don't know how I would react.
I'd probably feel dreadful for wasting their time, for one. 
All of this panicking and crap for what's deemed as something so small.
I don't want to call this abuse, or toxic. I can't do that because it doesn't feel like that, speaking from an emotional standpoint.
I guess I'll just say it was really bad.
Not so long ago, I broke up with a girl who i guess you could say wasn't the best.
She kind of treated me like crap, made me feel like everything was my fault.
Even looking back and knowing it wasn't, a part of me feels so guilty for something I know wasn't my doing[yet it still feels so].
She disregarded my feelings, then up and left for about three months, putting quite a bit in front of me, which I could understand at first.
You can't put everything on hold for one person, and I could understand that even at 13-14.(ive just turned 16 a few months ago)
It was online, so it's not like she could've drove near me and do anything, but that really didn't make me any less terrified everytime I saw messages of her being blatantly angry with me, being upset with soemthing I might've done wrong or said.
We never called much, which I suppose I'm thankful for, but the times we did, I guess it was okay.
I guess I was terrified of what my parents would think, given they weren't (still kind of aren't) the most supportive.
My father was upset when I came out, being that he couldn't quite accept that I'm gay.
She led me on though, and for a while.
She was really upset when I wouldn't just accept her confession and that she wanted to go out, so i guess I kind of forced myself to liking her just a bit.
It all kind of felt rushed, but I was truly in love with her, despite the fact that others would probably say it was just puppy love(I imagine for good reason).
She kind of made me think my friends were the bad ones, like she was in the right.
I gave her three chances, and I accepted her with no hesitation for every one of those.
I have flashbacks almost every day, I'm kind of terrified to do much or go anywhere near that reminds me of her.
I can't even say her name without breaking down.
I've had at least three panic attacks, one being in school to which the teacher had to escort me out and I had to go home.
This may be a bit disorganised, and I'm really sorry about that, but my brain is a bit jumbled and I guess this isn't the easiest to think and talk about.
This wouldn't be so hard if I didn't hear her, if I didn't see her in my head everytime.
The flashbacks aren't just flashbacks to me you know, they literally drag me in to a point at which I'm choking and trying to get out.
I tend to panic and not get ""out"" of it for a while, and I more often than not, dissociate from my body in a way so it seems.
I would go into depth a bit more, but I've been told that's what I do whenever I panic that way by an old therapist.
The memories aren't really in order, and I don't think I can remember specific things because they're going so fast, maybe?...
I don't think fast is the right word, but they're kind of just thrown at me all at once.
I can phsycially feel her, hear her sometimes, and being shizoafective doesn't help at all.
I'm so utterly frustrated at the fact that I'm unable to let go, but I don't think my family would deem it ""normal"" for me to say that there are memories holding me down or anything like that.
They wouldn't really understand, unfortunately.
I haven't told anyone about this but a friend who has been here from beginning to now with this whole ordeal, given my family's reaction won't be anywhere near supportive.
I'm going to a placement centre sometime soon, but I don't know when.
I'm terrified that I'm just overreacting, you know.
I'm terrified that a part of me just ""wants"" this in a way, like I deserve this.
Again, I really apologise for the mess, I'm not the most organised when it comes to my emotions and such.
She told me she was sorry and it was heavily implied that she, at the very least, attempted suicide.
How am I supposed to handle that?..
Everytime I think about it, I just think about the fact that this is just
It's nothing compared to something else so much worse.
She could've been here, you know?..
Phsycially been here, but she wasn't.
I know comparing isn't a thing of suggestion with something like this, but I have such a habit and compulsion to do exactly that.
I feel as though my problems and this is nothing whatsoever.
I feel pathetic for even being so distraught over it.
I'll probably delete this because I wouldn't want anyone finding this and making connections, if anyone I know happen to find this.
I really apologise for this though, I hope I'm not taking up anyone's important time.",Uuainaliante,2019-03-08 05:51:32,3,1036,7.4,8.08,89.34,4.37,19.92,13.51,95.46,65.93,24.9,15.25,11.58,0.19,0.58,2.51,0.39,9.65,4.34,12.64,12.74,8.11,7.72,4.73,22.88,4.63,2.8,1.93,1.16,3.09,5.89,1.83,3.96,1.83,0.58,0.39,8.11,0.39,0.19,2.51,0.19,21.72,4.54,1.54,2.7,5.5,2.51,6.37,2.7,0.29,1.06,1.35,1.35,0.48,0.58,0.1,0,4.44,1.06,0.39,1.83,0.48,0.97,5.89,14.19,1.25,11.2,2.03,5.69,3.67,0.19,0.29,0.29,0,0.1,0.1,0.29,0.19,0,0.1,0,0,20.46,5.41,6.47,0,0,0.29,0,0.1,0.77,6.66,0.58,0.19

ayrm0s,Recently diagnosed,"Hi all, 
As the title says, I was just recently officially diagnosed. I was dissociating for years, but meds (treatment for my bipolar diagnosis) caused me to come out of it and now my ptsd symptoms have taken over :(. I’m constantly anxious or depressed, and have so many fucking panic attacks. I’m incredibly frustrated with being startled by loud sounds that send me into meltdowns. I had no idea that my upbringing was so harmful to my wellbeing. Especially since I don’t remember most of the abuse, besides the emotional from junior high until I graduated high school. 
I guess I’m looking for support. And, I was wondering if anyone experiences others only hanging out with you because they pity you. I’m currently experiencing it and I’m hurt and frustrated. I do know that I’ve been very transparently vulnerable my whole life, and obviously prone to bullying, but god, I thought it wasn’t so obvious now that I’m an adult. Someone that I thought was interested in forming a friendship with me, and has been inviting me to hang out and go to things, just yesterday was trying to figure out ways to get me to make new friends. Because I’m in a new town, and have two friends - and that’s all I need!! She even suggested group activities to check out, when she knows I have severe anxiety and panic attacks when I even leave the house lately, and feel unsafe everywhere I go. She also said, as I left, that she hoped our hangout was “beneficial.” Goddamn it hurts. I wish I was still dissociating, and not able to feel as strong of emotions or vulnerability. I am in individual counseling as well as DBT, though, which is definitely immensely helping. 
I’d love to hear some ideas on coping with being startled, or constantly feeling unsafe. It’s hindering me so much that I can’t start EMDR yet, because I can’t figure out a safe space for it :(.

It's very hard for me to function when I don't feel safe or secure , when I say secure I mean knowing that all my ducks are in a row per say ( feeling in control of the ducks at the very least)

I just maintained that. Got my own apartment with my boyfriend. Found a new job that I LOVE. And now we have to move again. And I am so anxious. I feel safe here. This was finally home. And now that's being ripped away from me. 

I don't mean to but I keep going off on my boyfriend because well , my brain hurts and is so loud. No he doesn't deserve it but it's just how I react sometimes. I know he is stressed too but in that moment I just cannot express my feelings that well under so much stress.

Are there any suggestions as to how I can communicate , how I can ease the anxiety in the meantime and maybe a way I could explain to my poor bf why I am the way I am.  

I have been diagnosed with PTSD. I am on meds for depression but I don't currently have a therapist due to ins and finance issues.

She developed PTSD and didnt tell anyone. Months of nightmares and sleepless nights passed by until she started her treatment.

I have a lot guilt on my chest. She was the only one who loved me with my unattractive body, and I made her insecure about hers. I'm paralysed and depressed by these thoughts. Everytime I read that PTSD is incurable or how people are having it for years, it makes me more suicidal.

ayul9y,It took a 3 night festival of loud Carnaval music to finally admit to myself that I have PTSD,"As I begin to read into triggers and information on PTSD, I realize there is explanation for my emotional freakouts, constant negativity, and inability to live a normal life. I have been on emotional edge since the day my mother called me to tell me she had cancer of the blood and bone marrow. It was coupled with a bad experience with my last work contract. Then I went home and was her sole caretaker while my father worked for money to pay for her treatment. She withered away and died after an 11 month ordeal and no one helped me and the experience has left me traumatized and with serious PTSD. My boyfriend moved me to live with him in another country but it has been an insane struggle. At first the language and culture shock was too much to bear. Now that is better but I still feel as if I am Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde. One minute I’m my normal happy self, the next I am freaking out about how dirty my roommate and my apartment is. I have been seeing a therapist since September and honestly it has been life changing. And immensely helpful. But I am still ruled by my triggers. Every little thing just gets to me. It’s such a struggle to have a productive week go by without OCD, depression, and distraction. Then I feel like shit for being unproductive. Any dirt or crumbs in the house, loud persistent noises, and especially when my body is sick are huge triggers for me. Right now I have a bad earache/ear infection and apparently they are having a 3 day carnaval celebration outside my apartment in the street. I am struggling with my diet and with my mood of course. I had an episode today and I feel on edge like I will have another one with this music going until 3am for the second night in a row. But honestly this is the first time I’ve admitted to myself and to my boyfriend what we are dealing with. Trauma and PTSD. I’m not a crazy bitch with OCD, I mean I am, but right now I can’t control the state of crisis that is everything and every day in my life. I’m thinking I’m going to grab some cash and go have a beer and wurst and enjoy the carnaval festival. Perhaps it will help me not be so freaked out about the noise. It seems worse in my apartment. Anyways, I am rambling but I want you to know that I get up everyday hoping to do good for myself and not have a freak out. I don’t win everyday, I haven’t won the past 3, but I get up and try. And at least I’m feeding myself and keeping a journal now. I’m making serious progress with the depression, now I need to figure out how to work on this PTSD and OCD.

ayvqyx,DAE Repeatedly deny themselves a chance to do something?,"I've noticed that for the past few years, from college when the floor basically fell out from under me up through graduate school I've consistently denied myself chances for things that I've wanted to try or felt would help me.

Consistent exercise, hobbies, dating,  trying out career considerations, whatever it might be I think about it, consider the time and effort. Remind myself I would need to be patient and learn to get better at it. And as soon as I have a realistic understanding of what it would entail, I give up. Because the past showed me nothing is reliable or predictable and somewhere in my subconscious I feel I don't deserve anything but misery for my failure and that someone who was abused like me doesn't have a chance.

ayvsfi,It’s like just being *happy* is a trigger for me.,"I have no idea what to even say here. It’s something I’ve thought about just today after being diagnosed as someone with CPTSD the last few months. I used to be a really angry person. Now I’m not angry as much since getting out of my crap situation, and I’ve been working on my mental health. But honestly, when I hear news or something happy, it makes me have like a rock in my chest, i have a fight or flight response, and i have no idea why. It’s so upsetting, its like, no matter how hard i try, i am always going to be this bitter person my parents made me into.
I should be happy for them, it doesn’t impact me either way, so why bother being upset?

I have two examples, just today I was sitting on the sofa and my husband was saying his friend had gotten married and it was long distance, (like our relationship used to be). This person was basically apologising for saying long distances don’t work out at the beginning of our relationship because he’s went and married someone from another country as well. I feel like I should be happy that he’s happy. This has no impact on me, I haven’t seen him in years. He’s married and happy, that’s cool. But it kinda hurts. And I don’t even know why. I’m not bothered by what he said at all! Flattered or something, whatever. But for some reason it really hurt me. I should be happy for him, my husband certainly is! I wish i knew how to be normal there. It sucks. 

I guess a second thing that ‘triggers’ this rock in my chest is seeing people having happy relationships in public places. For some reason it makes my body swell up and it makes me really sad and upset, even if they’re meeting and having a great time together! I wish i knew why this was a thing. It’s none of my business. Why cant i just be happy for other people!? I hate this. I hate being so bitter, i have no reason to be. I don’t resent people, why does this cause so much pain.  :(",TheGamerHat,2019-03-08 13:47:49,15,379,5.77,17.78,76.47,9.53,12.63,10.82,97.89,63.59,23.75,14.51,11.87,0.53,0,1.85,0.26,9.23,2.64,11.35,14.51,7.65,7.39,3.69,22.69,7.39,2.64,3.17,0.53,2.37,9.23,3.96,5.28,0.79,3.17,0.79,10.55,1.58,0.26,0,2.37,17.15,2.9,6.07,1.58,3.69,0.79,4.22,3.96,0.53,1.32,1.58,1.85,1.06,0.79,0,0,5.54,3.43,0.79,0.53,0.79,0,4.22,14.78,0.79,9.76,0.79,5.8,3.17,1.06,0.53,0.26,0.26,0,0,1.58,0.53,0.53,0.26,0.26,0,19.26,6.33,5.01,0,0,0.53,1.06,0,0.26,5.01,0.53,0.53
aywi2y,"Hi, I'm New here","NSFW

If I what category this would fit under, advice or
 just venting maybe? I guess a start would be to say that I had to reach out the the crisis hot line a bit ago, because I get random bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts sometimes even when everything is going really well and in general I should be happy (is that part of the ptsd?) Anyway, that day I was feeling more suicidal than normal, and I explained to the lady that I was diagnosed with ptsd in seventh grade when I was sent to a mental hospital (self harm). The diagnoses came from when I was living with my uncle for about 2-3 years (from about 8 to almost 12 I think in that area, I have a horrible memory and can't match up dates or times well) they believe that he raped/molested/possibly drugged me,  but because of suppressed memories, I couldn't remember. This were things start to get a bit messy, I'm sorry, it's a complicated situation. But my mom hears all of this, and didn't give a single shit, even threatened several times after that to send me back to live with my uncle.  My step dad was supportive, but I don't think either of us were very comfortable talking about it, so I had to deal with this basically in my own. I had a lot of questions about it, how do I know it really happened if I can't remember? But reflecting on things and with situations that have happened, I truly believed he did. My first clue was how terrified I was and still am of him, even before going to the hospital, even though I didn't know why I would be. The worst I could remember at that point were just fights and he hit me a couple of times. My next clue was the dream I had (I've had a handful along these lines now) of him touching me, me crying and begging him to stop, and he said he would but he didn't. It felt so real and terrifying, and I woke up with a horrible panic attack that lasted most of the day (that happens every time I have a dream like that). I'm going to list the rest of kind of fast, or this will become a novel,  but; first time I had sex I blacked out mentally and cried afterwards, I had a panic attack every time I had sex, a feeling of I just need this to stop rn, they finally stopped for the most part though when I got with my now fiance, and could finally fully open up about everything fully and got help working through them (he was the only one who knew about the panic attacks), weird shit my uncle used to do when I was loving there, for example the laundry basket was always in his room, and he's look at the crotch of my panties,  also I was young and drink know better, and hated towels, and it was only about 4 feet from the bathroom to my room, so after my showered I'd book it naked to my room, but I remember every rhome I did that, he's be sitting on the couch where he could always see the hallway, even though you could see the tv better from the other side of the couch. Also, he stalked me for years, and still might be. Anyway, that's kind of the backstory to my diagnosis, and thing back to the beginning of this, the crisis hot lone said I should join a support group, I didn't like the one she recommended for me, so here I am.

Abuse could also play into my ptsd, my mom was physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive to me when she wasn't busy abandoning me.

Any,  I guess the advice or more of discussion part, has anyone else experienced some of the things I mentioned? I have a lot more issues with my ptsd, but I want to know if other people experience random depression and suicidal thoughts, and  repressed momories? And if you do how do you cope? How do you deal with repressed memories and have you ever tried to recall them? If so, how So?

ayy4g2,I am still in love with my abuser/sexual harasser and am moving closer to him [StockholmSyndrome],"I am still in love with my abuser/sexual harasser and am moving closer to him \[StockholmSyndrome\]

I am nervous and excited because I may be moving close to the school where the principal sexually harassed me. I need to move out before my parents come home (who were my worst abusers of all) and there are not many apartment options I can choose from.

He was inappropriate and abused his power as the principal of the school while I was an intern and I was not the only woman he harassed. He was married and recently had a kid. He would pretend he was not married around me, though, as he would take his ring of whenever I interned. He think he thought I was dumb and was amused when I did airhead things like bump into walls, get overly excited and act confused/fearful in his presence. I think I fed his ego whenever i got submissive around and needed his help because I seemed so incapable. When in reality a lot of me seeming incapable also had to do with him making me feel so dysregulated because my PTSD symptoms would act up around him. He wouldn’t take no for answer and did not respect boundaries. He was impulsive, quick to anger, and one time belittled me and told me he couldn't see me in the profession I was going to school for. He often treated me like I was amusing because I was incapable and he didn’t really respect me but you could tell he thought i was cute and preferred me silly, submissive, and dumb. When I wasn’t my silly self and was serious, assertive and intelligent, he seemed shocked and less attracted to me. 

One time he touched my leg while saying good morning and another time he touched my waist to lean in to hear what I was saying. He became very jealous when I talked to other male coworkers and one time he told off a coworker and eyed me down like he owned me. He tried to intimidate me and didn’t like when I challenged his authority. I felt like he treated me like property even though I was in no way his and he was married! But he also protected me at times from my rude supervisor and when I was down, I could tell he would be sad and cared about me. But I also feel like he would get down when I was down because it meant I wouldn’t give him attention. When I rejected him, he didn’t take it well and it made him very emotionally dysregulated---extreme sadness, anger, etc. I realize now I was probably triggering his attachment issues as he definitely had anxious/ambivalent attachment and I have disorganized so I can be very avoidant. I don’t even think he really knew much about me so I wonder how much he truly liked about me or was it more he was trying to repair an attachment wound that mirrored what happened when he was a child. Then he started harassing another female coworker after I rejected him and she tried resisting his advances. But then she started liking him because he is so charming and then i got jealous and asked her if she was okay. She knew that I knew and immediately ended the affair with the principal.

My Disorganized attachment was happening where I avoided him once I noticed that he really liked me and was no longer unavailable. Intimacy is scary and I knew the risk of him abandoning me was high as he had a family.. But also i think my ptsd hypervigilance was kicking in to protect me because he was not a safe person and was unstable (could have had borderline personality disorder or narcissistic personality disorder). I avoided him because he was married also scary because of his angry and commanding energy (but I also was so drawn to that energy). Ultimately, I rejected him because I knew I would crumble if he ended up hurting me. I was totally traumatically bonded to the principal. Yes, I was attracted to him and admired him for his leadership and work ethic. Also, being around him made me feel so feminine because we were pretty different/polarizing. He was also confident and stereotypically masculine. Plus I admired him so much--so hard working, dominant, and powerful. Plus I liked his sense of humor. While I was often scared of him, I also think i fell in love with him during my internship and I haven’t like someone that much since (2 years ago) . I feel like he saw the worst flawed parts of me and still liked me and kept fighting to be with me. Omg, I do not think I am over him.

On the last day of my internship, he kept trying to be around me and stare at me. At one point, my supervisor was rudely asked him what he was staring at. He asked me to help him with something and then he told me I was always welcome at his school. Then my supervisor came in because she could tell he was trying to talk to me.. And then he walked away because he had to go pick up his daughter. I told him thank you. That was the last time I talked to him. I loved him.

I didn’t report him because I was confused because I also liked him and He also was so charismatic, I knew he could easily get anyone to believe him and made me see like the crazy one. Especially because most of the people thought I was weird and crazy because of my extreme mood swings and ptsd symptoms. 

So anyways, yesterday, I ran into a girl who I remember used to be at his school when I was touring the apartment. She told me she would tell my old supervisor she saw me. The supervisor’s office is right by the principals plus they are close… so then i was like omg she may tell the supervisor and then the principal would find out (I would have really worried about that 2 years ago when he was exhibiting stalkerish behaviors). Another part of me was like, I hope she tells him so he knows… then another part of me was like, omg he probably doesn’t even think about me anymore.. I’m the one who needs to move on.

So, do I move to that apartment close to his school or not? And anyone else have been in this situation before where you fall for an unavailable man and you fear and love him at the same time?

ayzme9,My boyfriend &amp; I got in a fight because I got upset when he yelled even though it wasn’t at me,"Earlier today my boyfriend had to go to the doctor for a work related injury. Nothing too bad but we were at the doctors for about 4 hours. By the time we left, it was rush hour. 

My boyfriend is a horrible backseat driver, constantly yelling to stop &amp; pay attention for no reason. I usually don’t drive around him because of this but I had to since he couldn’t drive himself. That combined with rush hour &amp; I was stressed. I have ptsd from abuse as a kid/teenager so yelling is a big no no for me. We’ve been dating for a year &amp; a half now &amp; he knows this. 

So I was feeling pretty shitty, &amp; we were trying to figure out dinner. He called his parents &amp; was frustrated with how the whole thing with his work was playing out. He rose his voice on the phone which caused me to tense up. He said “I wasn’t yelling at you, calm down please” in a bit of a nasty voice. I had a long drive to my house, was tired, &amp; beginning to go into panic territory, so when my boyfriend’s parents wanted to order pizza I asked them not to get my anything. 

Boyfriend gets pissed and raises his voice over the phone saying all this shit like ‘snail changed her mind for who knows what reason, she hasn’t eaten today so I don’t know why she won’t let us feed her.’ Which, or course, sends me through the roof. 

I start crying a bit &amp; my boyfriend hangs up the phone. He then angrily says “please just take me home.” I turn towards his house &amp; he says “you know my parents only agreed to pizza because they wanted to eat with you, right?” And I said no I didn’t know that. Boyfriend says “come on you should know by now.” And I once again tell him no, you didn’t tell me this, sorry. My dog is home alone &amp; I need to go to him before the storm starts. He says “whatever. Take me home.”

So we sit in silence until we get home. I tell him I’ll be inside in a minute because my things are inside. I sit, cry in my car for a few minutes before he texts ‘still no to pizza?’ In which ask him to come outside. He says they need to know if I’m staying, and feeling bad, I say yes. He says that he knows I don’t want to but I agree. Me lying gets him more upset and I finally say I want to go home. He is clearly not happy with that but says I can go. I head inside to get my stuff only to get roped into staying for dinner by his parents. 

I lie on the bed for a long time and don’t say anything. I pretty much shut down the rest of the night. Thankfully after we ate I left without much of a word and cried the entire way home.

ayzr07,Staggered By Trauma To The Point Of Heavy Isolation,"Hey Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I imagine some of you might be able to relate and others may not. I am currently recovering from a massive psychological collapse which took place last summer. I have instinctively pulled back from society, as I can get triggered and re-traumatized fairly easily in social situations. 

I live in a beautiful, secluded area, and I am living on disability, so I do not need to work. My therapist will do sessions with me online, and I have a worker who visits weekly to help me set goals and build a framework for a future return to society and the working world. Also a close friend visits me when she can. On the one hand, I find comfort in solitude, on the other hand I find my triggers severely limit what I am able to do for myself in life.

I am quite often so resistant to the idea of interacting with strangers that I end up putting off things like stocking up on groceries or visiting any area where I might be faced with people. I remember a time when I was quite free and uninhibited in many aspects of my day-to-day life. I did as I pleased. I miss that deeply, and I feel very discouraged and afraid that things will stay this way. I feel as if I have lost myself and my life. This can be a devastating way to live.

Any supportive thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Love and Light,

Apart from the break ups there was gaslighting, occasional verbal abuse, constant miss trust and I felt like I was walking on egg shells. 

We broke up 4 months ago after she told me she didn't love me. I went no contact but she tried hoovering me back in using various tactics such as apologising then blaming then guilt trips then a major family problem. I've stayed no contact but I feel like shit.

I know I can’t deal with PTSD by not dealing with it, but I’m also sick of the fact that it seems to dictate a lot of who I am, not even because of the past that caused it necessarily, but because of the future of having to constantly make myself vulnerable to other people. 

I used to read about the subject a lot more and that helped, but since I graduated I’ve just felt completely blank, a recluse.

What’s the point. 

I can’t afford the one thing that finally started to make me happy. I’m so broken up.  I’ve got too much to worry about and now my brain can’t stop thinking and reliving this.

az3bx9,Rapist's Prison Early Release - Giving another statement?,"Hey all,

First time posting here, and looking to hear about some similar stories or people who KNOW of online resources - I'm not looking for legal advice. 

So I was a witness (not plaintiff) in a case against my rapist which put him in jail a few years ago. I decided not to join the lawsuit. Now he's trying to get out early and get off the sex offender registry. I don't see him getting off the list, but I would imagine based on the circumstances that him getting out early is plausible.

The judge wants to speak to the witnesses and plaintiffs again....about giving another statement or something. I have phone call next week to find out more information (what I'd be asked to say, why, when, etc.)

But it's next week and my anxiety's freaking out. I'm having trouble finding information online....**are there any resources that you know of to find out this process?** 

**And...** Do you think they just want me to speak to find out if I'd feel ""safe"" if he was released, or what? It wouldn't be like fully testifying again, would it? 

I haven't really heard of this happening before, so any advice you have or ideas on what this is all about would be wonderful.

az68z8,"Bleak Outlook: 30 y/o Female, Discouraged Regarding Several Areas Of Life","Hey Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

As the title mentions, I am feeling rather down on myself right now, and am not expecting the greatest things for my future. As many, if not all of you know, trauma can have a devastating impact on one's ability to function in day-to-day life. Additionally, it can disrupt one's ability to set proper goals and look to their future with a healthy mentality. When a person is so caught up with the past, it is a challenge to have a proper relationship with the present. Until that person gets proper help, this trend bleeds into their future, and stops the person from living to their full potential.

""So, get help then"" you might say. I am. I have had 25 hours of specialized psychotherapy since the summer, and I plan on continuing for as long as I need to. I wouldn't be surprised if I needed another 5 years. I'd do it. It certainly beats the alternative. I am tired of being ruled by my trauma. The therapist I found is very good, but there is only so much that can be done in 1-hour sessions. The surface has been scratched, but I have a deep world of darkness beneath that requires  very thorough attention.   

There are aspects of life which many others take for granted : work, school, socializing, romantic relationships, travel, you name it. I see little opportunity in any of those areas. With how high my trauma-based anxiety and avoidance are now, in addition to how poor my focus and energy reserves can be on hard days, the only chance I have at getting post-secondary education would be to find some way of doing it online from home with a self-paced setup.  (Yes, I am 30 and only have my high-school diploma, that's life for some with mental health issues). I used to work full-time, and I have over a decade of work experience on my resume, but I honestly have no idea what I would be able to do now, I feel so shattered and discombobulated.

My social circle is very small, as most of the people I used to spend my time with have moved to other cities or provinces of Canada. I can't picture making too many new friends because of how isolated I have become. Also romantic relationships feel so hopelessly far out of the question that I have given up on the idea. It's tricky enough to find love as a lesbian; especially as a femme lesbian, because everyone assumes I'm straight. When you top that off with being isolated on the outskirts of a small community, and being dominated by past trauma, it doesn't add up to much apart from the guarantee that I'll be able to roll as much as I want in my queen-size bed.

To sum up, I want a life. I want to be free. I don't want my remaining youth to be wasted being afraid of the world. I know I have some good stuff going for me, but this is no way to live.

az7doe,"Not diagnosed with anything. Just made a connection with a childhood trauma and intense anxiety, and wondering if it could be the cause. Any input welcome!","Hi there! 
I’ll get right to it. As a toddler I witnessed one of my parents die suddenly, and I saw the reaction of the other parent and the paramedics responding to the scene. This is my very first memory, after which I have absolutely no memories for a couple years. Nothing about having the event explained to me, staying with grandparents, the funeral. Nothing. I have that one memory then flash forward a few years to normalcy with no-one really talking about what happened. Growing up I was aware of this memory but didn’t view it as good or bad, it was just what happened. However I grew into a fairly anxious child/teen - often worrying about my family and in particular about health problems. Bit of a hypochondriac! Went to therapy as a teen for anxiety, and have just been referred again now in my twenties. At the appointment where I got referred, my doctor asked if anything traumatic had happened to someone close to me before. This question was asked to me 6 months previously at another appointment, and I said no. But this time I said, well I saw one of my parents pass suddenly, and she seemed to think this connected a lot of things. Looking back, I kind of agree - the first time I went to therapy, my anxiety attacks began exactly the day after I saw someone else collapse, just like what I saw as a child.

az85cs,Helping a SO with PTSD,"Hi everyone, 

My SO is currently in a really bad place after being robbed by a group of armed men. I'm not sure if this qualifies as the actual disorder, but even so, it's a similar situation. And since I've been lucky enough to not have dealt with anything that could scar me emotionally, I don't fully grasp what she is going through. I've read a lot of articles on dealing with the stress after traumatic events/helping your loved ones do so, but I admit I can't even begin to understand what it must feel like.

Obviously all I want is to see her feeling better, so I'd like to ask for some advice... So far, what I've done is give her some space (she likes to stay in closed quarters for a while when things go downhill, to process everything and whatnot) while still making it abundantly clear that I am there for her should she need anything.  I don't wanna push it or anything, she needs her space, so I don't wanna pressure her into trying to go out too soon or anything (it just happened last week). But I'm making myself as available as possible too.

Does anybody with more experience in situations like this have any advice? Anything I could do, or any way to act to ease things up for her? Is what I'm doing wrong somehow? 

Really appreciate it!",ankaa_,2019-03-09 13:10:34,5,241,13.31,33.9,42.83,57.15,18.54,14.94,91.7,64.73,21.99,12.03,7.47,0,0.41,4.15,0,9.96,3.32,15.35,13.28,8.3,9.13,2.49,21.58,4.98,4.56,2.07,0.41,3.32,5.81,3.73,2.07,0.83,0,0,10.37,0,0,4.15,0.41,21.16,2.49,1.24,4.15,7.88,2.9,4.98,2.49,0.83,0,1.24,0.41,0,0,0,0,3.73,1.24,0.83,0.41,0.83,0.83,1.24,15.35,1.66,13.28,2.07,6.64,4.98,0.83,0,0,0,0,0,0.83,0,0,0,0,0,17.43,4.15,4.56,0,0,1.24,0.41,0,0,4.98,1.66,0.41
az8jk1,Does this sound like PTSD?,"I've always thought I had something along the lines of PTSD, however I used to associate PTSD with being in the military so I thought I didn't have it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to make this short. Ever since I was a kid I have always been incredibly withdrawn when around people. I was okay around immediate family and very close friends, but when around people I didn't have a deep connection with (which was pretty much everyone except for a select few) I would completely shut down. I remember my stomach would get extremely tight and simultaneously my brain felt like it was being shut off. I couldn't find words so I wouldn't talk. From ages 3-15 I went through school only talking if I was forced to (usually by teachers), which resulted in me never saying a word for 95% of the time. I would try to communicate with others by body language (nodding head, shrugging shoulders, etc), because I was unable to talk to them. Even when I wanted to, immense fear would wash over me and I would clam up even more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hated this about myself but for the majority of my school years I couldn't change even though I desperately wanted to. When freshman year started and I was in a new school, I made it my mission to get over this and talk more. I was able to progress slightly for about a year and a half, but halfway through sophomore year I started becoming severely depressed (which lasted throughout the rest of highschool), and I reverted back into my old self. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was told that I was ""just shy as a kid,"" but I know it was something deeper than that. The thing is I don't know why I acted that way. It was probably something to do with my Dad but I never had a clear cause, and reading about PTSD I always thought it was a defining moment that made someone be diagnosed with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

az9dbx,Does anybody else have these symptoms? [TRIGGER WARNING],"I'm not asking for a diagnosis. I'm just wanting to compare what I have to what others may have. For a bit of context, I'm still underage.

I have constant flashbacks. Screams, spankings from over a little under a decade ago, me crying, everything just swarms my mind once I finally manage to clear it.

I have depression, or at least I'm told so. I know practically every teen these days have depression and it doesn't have credibility anymore, but... Well, the world just feels gray. I'm not able to feel happy anymore. Euphoria, yes, maybe. Over a joke or something. But I genuinely don't see fun in the world anymore.

I contemplate suicide a lot more than I should. And I don't regret it. Ashamed? Maybe, yes. But I wouldn't regret it one bit if I went through it.

I have nightmares that... I oddly cannot remember. I wake up drenched, woozy and tired, but can't remember a thing. My sister says I scream during sleep and walk around. (Which... Doesn't help me a lot, just makes me feel embarrassed. But still.)

I have omnipresent voices in my head. Most of those are my own, telling me I'm worthless or repressing myself. 

I have very low self-esteem, and an utter inability to take any compliments. It's like pouring water into a bottomless cup; it may be full for a split second, but it's empty right after.

On the other hand, I also cannot get in my head that I may be depressed or I may be abused or something. One of my closest friends keeps telling me I have PTSD, but I just... Can't believe him. 

Maybe it's because I see what I've gone through as nothing compared to what others have. I wasn't... Sexually abused or forced into labor. I was physically and mentally hurt at a relatively young/vulnerable age (I really do not want to get in to much depth about that, but... More often than not, I'd spend my nights contemplating ending all this havoc, and the nights where I wasn't were probably because I was too tired.), But... That's about it.

I also have intermittent explosive disorder or IED

I have an insane temper. I have the violent outbursts. Every little thing that pisses me off is a struggle to keep from overreacting and punching somebody in the face. 

And then when I do meet up with a rude entitled person I’m basically triggered and then ready to murder them. 

It makes driving a struggle because the road rage is so severe. I live in Seattle so there’s nothing I can do except wait to move. 

I usually just try to walk now or take the bus or Uber. 

But dealing with people daily is a constant struggle. 

I know I need to learn how to deal with difficult people but it flairs my temper so much that it’s getting to the point where I might end up in jail with an assault charge.

And again Seattle has the most difficult people to live with and I just have to deal with that and wait till I move.

At the worst point, I even thought I might be dead, because nobody had responded to me for so long.  
Now when my partner doesn’t answer fast enough, or if she cuts me off or walks away while I’m talking, I immediately fly off the rails. I shout, insult her, run around the flat, punch my legs all while feeling absolutely f%#*ing terrified. And I’m a big guy so this probably terrifies her too. I feel ashamed by all of it but I can’t stop it from happening, no matter how hard I try. Sometimes I manage to remain calm if she does it once or twice but it seems whenever she is in the mood to not listen to me, she’ll find a way to do it sooner or later. Anyway, during these intense moments, I have a real sense that **this is 100% forever. This is my life now and it will always be this way.** And of course, if I manage to stay calm for the first or second time she does it, that only makes it more severe when I eventually lose the plot because, by the third time, it seems all the more likely that this feeling will never go away because she will just never listen.

For months I beat myself up physically and mentally for missing her. Everyone told me she was a horrible person, a crazy lunatic who didn’t deserve friends.

azdnrz,First anniversary - I can’t make it through this alone,"First off I grew up in a very “every man for himself” sort of situation. So I never had any support system. And when what happened happened I just crumbled. 

And now a year later I feel like it’s all happening again. I’m scared, I’m frightened that any moment the event is going to happen again no matter where I am or how safe the environment. 

I’ve got one good friend who, besides my mother, is the only person that knows. I want to reach out to her and beg her to please just stay with me for a few hours. She’s very busy. We haven’t spoken in months. I love her, but she doesn’t understand the concept of ptsd. And I don’t want to bother her. 

The 5th marked the first day of a long drawn out event that went on for 8+ days. 

I’m a tough guy, at least I like to think of myself as such. That I’m not subservient to my emotions. But god damn it I broke down in tears at least 3 times today. Im so alone. It wasn’t even a major catastrophe, there’s plenty of people out there who’ve gone through way worse. But Jesus im scared and I’m never scared. 

I don’t see the point anymore, like I’ve lived all the years I can and it/I should just be put to rest. I’m not actively suicidal anymore, but the thought is there. What is there to live for now? I’ve been fighting back self-harm for an entire year. I can’t give in now. But really. 

I’m constantly reminding myself about how far I’ve come in a year, personally and otherwise. I’m hardly the same person, for the better, mostly. I did things. I’ve done things, even if they were small successes I still did them. But that doesn’t get rid of it. 

It’s been 1 year. I’m falling apart. Shit, im grieving. Im living in fear. That it may happen again. I just don’t know what to do. I just know whatever it is I can’t do this alone. It hurts so much. 

And I can’t/refuse to seek professional help. That’s what started all this bs in the first place. 

Sorry this turned into a full rant. But who else do I tell? Writing things down hasn’t helped. I just know that nobody will ever read them, I’m just talking to myself in a different way. I can’t drive due to epilepsy so I can’t go out whenever I fancy to take my mind off it. I can hardly afford a cab and even still I live in the middle of nowhere. Nothing. And yes I was medically diagnosed with ptsd so this isn’t just some mad rambling. Well it is but.. I used to love springtime.

TL;DR I just need some advice on how to get through these months..

azh38p,How to deal with friends that cut you out of their lives/just don’t care?,"Hello, I’m currently dealing with PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Last year I was suicidally depressed for a large part of the year; thankfully I’m starting to get better. Last May I had dinner with my two friends of 10 years (from college) and confided in them that I have PTSD and was somewhat struggling. I didn’t make the conversation emotional or awkward, and the dinner seemed to go well. After that, they both dropped off the face of the earth. I haven’t spoken to friend 1 since. Friend 2 randomly saw me at work in November, and talked for 20 minutes.....about her new boyfriend; she didn’t ask how I was doing at all.

Now, I’m not looking for a pity party or anything like that. We’re in our late 20’s, so I would think we’re mature enough to be able to confide in our friends, as well as show support. We all used to be very close, and I just don’t understand why they would suddenly drop a friend who needs their support.....I was even in friend 1’s wedding. 

I lost another male friend who tried to drunkenly sexually assault me (to make me “feel better”) when I turned to him for support.

azkssf,I miss my abuser so much. It makes me feel gross.,"I was trafficked as a child/young adult. Obviously, there were many people involved in this situation, but there was one man that was mostly in charge. I got news a couple of weeks ago that he died in prison. Everyone in my life feels like I should be happy or relieved about that, but I'm not happy at all. It's really.... painful. I feel like I'm in mourning over his death. 

I keep having dreams about all of the ""nice"" things he did for me. Handing me a glass of water. Allowing me to sit on the couch after a particularly violent encounter. Giving me a blanket to sleep with when I was really sick. I can't stop. I literally catch my brain thinking that this dude loved me and I'm really sad that I'll never be able to see him again. Which is probably the most fucked up thing I've ever thought in my life. Seriously. This man killed my daughter and essentially ruined my life, but my brain is somehow trying to convince me that he loved me???? It makes me nauseous that I could even think that, but somehow it creeps back in. 

I've told a couple people in my life about these feelings and everyone is like ""dude, that's fucked up. How??"". I don't know how?!? I'm crazy. I don't know. I guess i just wanted to share with some people who might understand. I am hoping these weird feelings pass quickly and never come back. Jesus.

azlg4y,Girlfriend with cPTSD giving me the cold shoulder,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about 3 years. We started out long distance and she moved here with her child (now age 8) to be with me. We had an apartment together and things didn't work out the first time around. This was mainly because she has PTSD and had a drinking problem at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved out and we became more and more distant until one day she broke up with me through a text message. I ended up moving back into the apartment for a while but bought a house while we were broken up (breakup lasted about 7 months).

&amp;#x200B;

She tried reaching out to me many times until she finally tried moving on. I decided that I couldn't live without her and reached out. It turned out that we both missed each other every day and we had a conversation to clear the air a couple days after getting back together. I told her how in the last couple weeks of our relationship I hung out with one of my good female friends from highschool. I honestly couldn't remember if we ever hung out alone until we were officially broken up (my other male friend from highschool was over there to my knowledge both times we hung out and I tried explaining this to her). She got really mad thinking that I was trying to line someone else up before we broke up. This could not be further from the truth because it was only platonic. I never pursued this woman for a relationship even after my girlfriend and I broke up. I was just trying to be honest with my girlfriend so she would trust me. I was never in a place to move on even if I wanted to.

&amp;#x200B;

During out breakup my girlfriend also moved her mother out here and right before I reached out to my girlfriend she found out that her mom has terminal cancer. I've done what I can to help like taking time off of work to take her mom to chemotherapy appointments, bringing dinner, etc. Just trying to be the best version of myself I can possibly be.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the issues. We started arguing because my girlfriend was becoming increasingly moody. She wouldn't tell me what was wrong. I finally got her to open up to me and she said she said it was a number of things. She didn't want to go on dates with me because she thinks I check out other women (which I don't think I do but said I would be extra sensitive about that), she thought my body language was indicating I was looking at porn (I informed her I haven't looked at any of that since we've been back together), and that she still didn't believe me that my friendship with the other girl was platonic (mind you, I told my friend I couldn't talk to her anymore and it was bad for my relationship and blocked her when I was hanging out with my girlfriend). My girlfriend was short with me and didn't want to hang out.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a couple more weeks and she said she was upset about the other girl still, that she didn't think it was platonic, and didn't hang out with me for about a week and a half.

&amp;#x200B;

Things were better for like 3 days until I said I was going to stay at my house for a night or two because I own a house and need to be here sometimes etc. The next day she said she was in a bad mood and I told her if she wanted a little space I'd come over the next day. I actually ended up asking her if she wanted to hang out anyway that night but she said no that she thought I was staying home and didn't  prepare for me to come over (it was kinda late when I asked). Well the day came and she was being very short with me. I called her on my break at work and she said she was in a bad mood. I asked if she wanted to hang out she said maybe and we decided to play it by ear.

&amp;#x200B;

I texted her when I got home asking if she wanted to hang out and she said something like ""idk what do you wana do?"" I said I didn't want to pressure her into hanging out if she needed some space and we could hang out tomorrow. Well the next day rolled around and she said she didn't feel like she could express herself to me. I told her that I didn't want her to feel that way and to lay it on me. She said she felt like I do more with my family than her and I'm embarrassed of her or something. My sister had been in an altercation and she was basically jealous I was trying to help her out. She said I never take her anywhere (I went to dinner with mom because I hadn't seen her in a while and my girlfriend even made the suggestion). She was mad I didn't text her all day when I was with my mom and I pointed out that she could have reached out to me too. I asked her if she wanted me to take her out that weekend (mind you, she recently told me she didn't wanna go out with me). She changed the subject and got mad about the girl I hung out with right before our first breakup, yet again. Then just completely stopped responding.

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't respond for 2 days until I finally told her I was concerned about her well being and she coldly replied that she was fine no worries. I asked her if she wanted to talk and she said ""at some point, yeah"" and went on to explain about how she won't tolerate any dishonesty in her life etc. I told her that's fine to talk when she's ready. I kept texting her goodnight and that I love her and only received silence in return. I didn't text her for 24 hours and then I said I'd like to talk when she's ready and that I'm not trying to force her into conversations when I'm reaching out and that I just want to make sure she's ok. I said I hope she's doing ok and that I miss the sound of her voice and her family. She said in her reply she's not trying to be dramatic or mean. I said that's fine and to take her time and that everyone has their own process (when she talked to me last week she said she has a mental illness and get stuck sometimes). I told her to talk to me when she's ready and that I'll be here. She said ""thanks miss you too"" and I left it alone. I texted her goodnight and that I love her and received no reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

This afternoon I sent her a funny YouTube video to try and lighten the mood and still haven't got a reply.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do?? I love this woman with all my heart. I'd never cheat on her. I want her to trust me. I have terrible anxiety and I'm trying to not put pressure on her and be a man but it's so hard. I'm trying to initiate conversation once or twice per day and letting her know I'm still here and thinking about her. I'm so frustrated. I cried this morning and yesterday morning. I'm a wreck. Please help.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I was raped repeatedly by a neighbor when I was 6-7. What made it worse was that he was 11 and so seven years later when it finally clicked for me that all those sexual impulsive memories coming up was rape, I told my mom and her first response was ""oh you were kids. You were experimenting."" He repeatedly threatened me and forced himself on me. It's crazy because he was a kid, but then again child killers exist, so it's not entirely crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm 23 now and I've been in therapy for two years. I was also raped two years ago, which is why I started therapy, but I noticed the childhood abuse left more of a scarring on my psyche. Now, I've had several breakdowns and my insomnia has worsened to the point where I'm not sleeping. Period. My family is cold as hell and my estranged mom called me and when I told her I was struggling with the memories she said, ""It happened a long time ago. You need to get over it and move on."" Woof. Lots of tears on that one. I live with my sister and grandparents and they're all narcissists so there's no love or compassion there. I have one friend who knows, but I don't want to keep burdening her with all my shit, because she's a STEM major and they have a shit ton of stress on their shoulders. I feel so alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I think some of the reason why this is all coming to the surface is because I've finally felt ok to start a relationship. There's a guy I've been texting and talking to on the phone a lot (we talk for hours) and he's coming back to school next quarter which I'm excited and nervous about. I haven't texted him lately (not ignoring him) bc I've been so shitty, but it makes me feel worse because he hasn't messaged me on his own. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but it all adds to this huge shadow that is getting bigger and bigger and just blocking everything out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I need is some love and encouragement from you strong, beautiful people. Anything helps!

azp5jm,Need your opinion- Honesty with insurance advocate?,"I was recently released after 4 weeks from a ritual abuse trauma unit at a hospital. Less than a week out my husband decided to leave me. Because of the hospital stay, I’ve been assigned a counselor to check in on me from the insurance company.

Have any of you ever been assigned one of these people and regretted being honest with them? Can it affect how the insurance company handles claims, etc?

azp5uv,"PTSD has flared up after 10 year depression battle and it’s ruining my marriage. *Trigger warning, NSFW*","This may be triggering and it’s long, it’s my first ever post and I apologize if I’m in the wrong place. TL/DR @ the bottom.  I finally seem to be getting better after a 10 year battle with treatment resistant depression (after EXTREME measures were taken, but yay)! The bad news is the PTSD that I thought I’d already worked through w my psychiatrist and an EMDR therapist are arising again and it’s seriously affecting my marriage. Side note: my husband was very aware of my mental state when we married 2 years ago.

I was sexually abused by my brother as a young girl, and my therapist and I figured out recently that all of my sexual experiences since then have always involved dissociative measures (alcohol or marijuana). We figured out due to my extensive electroconvulsive therapy treatments that I’d undergone for years, that perhaps it had put my brain in a slightly dissociative state. The bottom line: sex never used to be an issue w my husband.   

Now that my depression has lifted and my ECT treatments have been stoped, my PTSD has come back and I can’t stand to be touched in a sexual manner. I’ve told my husband this isn’t his fault nor, do I believe is it mine, as this was an unforeseen circumstance of healing.  I have apologized and agreed it’s unfair to him and myself. He seems to have zero grasp on how badly it affects me and I do my best to please him when I feel I can, but there’s no intimacy for me and it feels like sex is a chore now. He says he’s “disappointed” if we go a single day w/o sexual intimacy, and I’m already painfully aware and feel like a horrible wife. 

Here’s where I don’t know what to do, he’s the breadwinner of the household and takes care of me like always, but he seems to be keeping tabs on our sex life which I just cannot live w that kind of pressure. He told me he wants “passionate sex or ‘chore’ sex, but it’s not going to be nothing.”   I refuse to live in this kind of marriage and I’ve asked for many months to go to couples’ therapy. His response was “what would my purpose be in being there if this is a ‘you’ issue?”

Until recently, after I threatened divorce, we’ve finally worked out that he’s just going to have to live w masturbation until I can get the weekly EMDR working again. Alcohol is no longer an option and I no longer live in a state where marijuana is legal so I don’t want to risk that.  Plus the idea that I have to dissociate to be intimate w my husband just disgusts me and I’m saddened that he’s willing to do it. 

I just don’t know how to handle this, I’ve moved into our spare bedroom so I’m not accidentally enticing him.  I feel like I’m up against time and as we all know healing takes a lot of time. I could use any advice or suggestions/support.

TL/DR: my depression is lifting and my sexual trauma-based PTSD is returning, resulting in not wanting sex w my husband. He thinks it’s “my” problem and doesn’t want to go to couples counseling despite me seeing a psychiatrist for years and an EMDR therapist for months. It took a threat of divorce to get him to understand the severity of my situation, but he can’t seem to grasp that sex is suddenly not fun for me because i keep getting flashbacks.

In the past before my children were born I was a terrible person and I did a lot of bad things. These things have never really left me and I am troubled by them even though I got away from that world and stopped doing them.


Particularly if I drink they come back to bother me. If I drink and I sleep then often I wake up crying and the things fresh in my mind images and smells like it just happened. 


I am no longer able to harm anyone physically or emotionally even to save myself. I can't even hunt animals as I learned recently when I went hunting with some friends. I no longer have the stomach for another pain even if they are abusing me. (My partner beats me regularly but I don't leave cause that would hurt them)

azq1i9,PTSD and the Police,"My parents are Mexican but moved to the US in the 80s. We used to take trips to Tijuana regularly because it was about 4 hrs away from our home. My first negative experience with figures of authority involved border agents sending us to secondary revision because my father didn't understand English very well and responded incorrectly to one of the questions. They asked if we brought anything from Mexico and he said no but because we had grocery bags in the back that was enough to cause suspicion. We were let go eventually but I still remember the dread of the event. Recently, I've had to deal with police officers coming to my residence looking for someone claiming to have an arrest warrant. The three times they were here I felt insulted, violated, subhuman. The police have insulted my disability. They've forced their way into my home while claiming to be willing to talk outside. They've threatened to break down doors. I've reached out to friends in activist circles and they've helped me deal with some of the trauma and given me information about organizations to reach out to. I've only been able to sleep sporadically. I'm afraid to open doors or go outside. I haven't been taking my meds. Everytime I feel like I'm making progress, something gets in the way of my recovery.

azqeb3,Girlfriend (F/35) with PTSD just broke up with me (M/40)...looking for advice,"I'll start this all by saying that I'm hurting pretty good right now. Both for myself and the likely end to a wonderful relationship, but mainly for her and whatever she's going through on her own. With that being said, I'm really glad that I found this sub tonight and I'm hoping that by talking about everything with a group of people that understand both her and I, I'll be able to better process what just happened. So thank you in advance for reading what I'm about to write and for any and all advice you might have for me moving forward.

I guess I'll start with the backstory. We met roughly 15 years ago. I was tending bar and bouncing at a popular college bar. Mutual friend introduced us. We went out on three or four dates, but like most relationships at that age, it didn't go anywhere. I remember at the time I was pretty bummed. She was and still is the most attractive woman I've ever known. Beautiful, funny, very sweet, and smarter then anyone I've ever come into contact with then or now. Years later, when we started talking again, it turns out we both had crushes on each other, but like I said, early 20's relationship, lol. We would see each other from time to time out and about, say hello, but that was about it. We lost contact with each other after she graduated. I friended her on FB a few years later, but other then leaving each other the yearly Happy Birthday post, we had no contact.

This past July she sent me a message on FB messenger. I was at work so really couldn't talk, but I got her phone number. Texted her on my next day off. Didn't really think much of it at the time. Figured we would text a few times, catch up, and that would be that.

Texted for a week or two and then she asked me to give her a call. Calls quickly turned into video chats. And then daily texts back and forth. Followed by even more marathon phone calls.

Over the course of a few weeks, we quickly got caught up with what we both had been up to since we last saw each other many years ago. It was really nice.

By mid August we were talking or texting daily. And then it happened. For whatever reason, out of nowhere, she completely let her guard down. She started filling in a lot of the blank spaces.

Short version. She had a really rough stretch of time between early 2017 to roughly the time she reached out to me. 

It began with an ectopic pregnancy. While getting treatment for the ectopic pregnancy, her partner of 12 years became distant, to the point where she was going for treatment alone. And then complications arose because of the treatment she was receiving. She sought treatment for severe stomach pain at the hospital she worked at (she is an ICU nurse) and they misdiagnosed her. They sent her home from the ER while she was bleeding internally. Her father, thank god, stopped by her house that night, found her passed out, and rushed her back to the ER. This time they realized she was bleeding into her abdomen and rushed her into surgery. But her ordeal wasn't over. When they intubated her, the tubing they used was too large which ended up paralyzing her vocal chords (she has 75% function now). And while all this was happening, her partner was nowhere to be found. 

She spent three weeks in the hospital, including time in the ICU. While recovering from all this, the relationship fell apart, and just because she hadn't been through enough, she developed Cushing's Disease as the result of her doctor over prescribing steroids.

I can't even begin to imagine going through all that. But sadly, it wasn't the last of it. Her best friend, a fellow nurse, moved in with her to take care of her. Her friend was self medicating with pain medication she was stealing from work, overdosed, and died in my gf's house. My girlfriend found her and performed CPR for 20 minutes while waiting for the ambulance. It absolutely crushed her.

I can't even begin to express the heartache I had as she told me all this. Even now, as I am writing it, I can feel myself tearing up. I've never known someone so brave and so strong. And to let me in, to open up and tell me everything, to tell me what had happened, how she was suicidal and spent some time in a mental health hospital, and how she was diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety, well, it touched my heart in a way that I cannot fully express. It meant so much to me that she trusted me enough to let me in, to trust me and know that I wouldn't judge her. 

Towards the end of August, while chatting one evening, she asked me to be exclusive, which we have been ever since. It's a long distance relationship, which isn't ideal. We are also both extremely busy. She started a new job this past September at a new hospital and is also getting her masters while I also work full time and started trade school. I'm also a city boy with no car so we have only physically seen each other three times in seven months, the last time being last weekend. Not ideal, but up until today we have been making it work. Honestly, I would bet that we are more intimate than most couples that see each other daily or fairly regularly.

And I've done my best trying to support her while she continues to battle her disorder. I've read everything I can find about it. I realize that there isn't a cure for it, that it's something that she will live with for the rest of her life. But I also know that with the treatment she receives, seeing a counselor, and with time, it will get easier for her to deal with.

So backstory all caught up.

She had a really bad flashback last weekend. She was supposed to visit me Saturday and Sunday. Called me early Friday evening crying. The hospital she now works at floated her to the mental health wing. I didn't know this, but it's where she was committed when she was suicidal. It obviously was very traumatic for her and it brought back flashbacks of her friend. I did my best to support her over the phone, and we both decided that I would go to her that night, so I hopped in a Lyft and drove 85 miles to her. When I got to her house she seemed better but was still clearly dealing with it. We talked until 5 in the morning. I held her and just listened for hours as she got it out. I didn't interrupt her, I didn't pour on the cliches, I didn't stop her when she repeated herself, I just sat there holding her hand and listened. 

The next day she seemed to be doing better. We went to lunch at the mall (which is a place she wouldn't have gone even six months ago) and did a little shopping. She was still a bit anxious, but I think me being there helped. Had dinner at her friend's house with a few couples she didn't know, and again, seemed to be better then the night before. When we got home, we stayed up again all night talking. It was really nice to be honest. She brought up her flashback two or three times, but it was mainly us just talking about school, laughing, smiling, joking around. Left Sunday morning. All week she seemed to be handling things well, or as well as could be expected. Daily texts, a call here or there, nothing out of the ordinary.

Saturday she worked a 15 hour day shift. Called me when she got home to say goodnight which is our normal routine. Was supposed to work another 12 hour day shift yesterday but got put on call. She called me early morning to say hello, again everything was fine. And then Sunday evening, she started texting me. Sent me a picture of her voicemail with five messages all coming from me this week. Three of them there was no message ( I didn't hang up before voicemail picked up but I didn't leave any message). And the other two were just short how are doing today types. In her text she said ""These are all the messages I haven't listened to because it gives me anxiety"". I called her a few minutes later and everything seemed fine. She then hung up and sent me a video chat invite. We started chatting and it went downhill from there.

Her mother and stepfather just got approved for a home loan in Myrtle Beach. We live in NY. She is most likely going to move with them. 

Gotta back up a minute here. Several weeks ago while talking on the phone she offhandedly made a remark that she could fit two people in her apartment and then asked me if I thought so. I jokingly asked her if she was getting a roommate I didn't know about. She said no, that she was hoping I would move in with her eventually. I told her that would be something I would very much like in the near future. And then again this week we touched on it. I told her that I would like to at least close the gap this fall, maybe get my own place if she wasn't ready to live together and she seemed genuinely excited. I said that I wanted to be closer to her, that I would find some sort of job and continue my education out her way.

So she tells me that she has been thinking for the last four days about moving with her mother. I ask where does that leave us. We talk a bit and I tell her that I would want nothing more then to come with her if that is what she decides. Either way, I want to close the gap and we have months to figure everything out. She again seems excited.

We hang up but she calls again. She isn't saying anything. I ask her whats going on but she won't speak. When she finally does speak, through tears, she tells me it's work related. I ask her to talk about it but she won't so I tell her when she's ready I'm here to listen. She hangs up. Hour later I get a text that reads ""I'm sorry love. I can't do this anymore. I'm really sorry. I just can't.""

My heart is absolutely broken. She definitely did not seem like herself the last time we talked. And she was crying. I'm not sure what to think right now. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I tried calling once but no answer. She sent a video chat request but when I answered she wasn't there and then she blocked me on Messenger.

I couldn't live with myself if something I said or did caused her any pain. I just wish she would talk to me. She is so much more then my girlfriend, she's my best friend who I love and care about unconditionally. There literally isn't a thing in this world I wouldn't do for her.

What's going on here folks? Is she afraid that after how her last relationship ended that it'll be the same with me so she's pushing me away now? Did I trigger something? I know that she loves me, that I am certain about. If she didn't she wouldn't have been crying, right?

At a complete loss right now. Sorry for the wall of text. She's in pain and all I want is to talk with her, to tell her I love her unconditionally, that I'll always be here for her no matter what.

What do I do? Send a text? Tell her that I love her, that she's more then just my GF, that she can tell me anything. And then let her know that I'm scared too, but that I think she is worth any fears I might have. And then just tell her that I'm going to give her space and time?

Any and all thoughts, suggestions, etc. would be greatly appreciated. I really do love her, and even if we are done, I don't want to lose her as my friend.",sjeter99,2019-03-11 00:16:19,6,2128,19.69,71.68,62.63,54.98,13.73,13.25,94.88,60.29,23.21,16.73,6.86,1.6,0.09,7.85,0.33,6.48,4.18,12.31,9.45,6.3,8.08,2.35,20.21,4.23,2.02,1.64,1.32,2.82,4.46,3.01,1.46,0.28,0.09,0.7,17.43,0.33,0.85,8.08,0.19,12.45,2.4,0.8,1.83,2.96,1.88,4.18,2.26,0.56,1.17,0.47,2.4,0.33,1.55,0.09,0.33,7.94,3.81,1.27,1.83,1.36,0.38,8.6,9.45,2.11,19.17,2.73,7,9.92,1.27,0.89,0.47,0.33,0.05,0.19,0.61,0,0.28,0.09,0.23,0,16.17,7.05,4.56,0,0,0.33,0,0,0.19,3.34,0.56,0.14

azuoma,Do I Need a Diagnosis?,"I'm 18, turning 19 in June.   
I was abused emotionally and sexually (and in a weird way physically) by my first ever boyfriend when I was 16. Drove me to self harm, suicidal ideation, blah blah you know. I have flashbacks, I had recurring nightmares for a while, and randomly sometimes start thinking about it and freaking myself out. I still get triggered by things that remind me of it, and I avoid going to the part of town where he lived, even though he doesn't live there now. I'm 90% sure I have PTSD.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have anxiety and ADHD. Back when all this was happening, I was in therapy because I thought these were the source of my problems. It didn't help because I was actually just being abused and didn't know it because of gaslighting. This means i don't have an awesome relationship with therapy as an experience.  


I'm doing a lot better now. My boyfriend and I are able to have sex, and we're working on slowly ironing out sexual triggers one by one. I'm doing great in school, and I have friends and my family life is good. To an onlooker, my life is going fine and there's no reason for me to do therapy.

azwe6o,I can't take it anymore. It's not fair.,"I can't live like this. I feel weak, unconfident, paranoid, scared and depressed. This is all because of a traumatic event I had in high school over 3 years ago. Some assholes were supposed to fvck me up as retaliation for jumping one of their friends, which wasn't true. I was never a ""street"" guy. I was just sticking up for my sister because she was getting picked on by this guy. Anyways, even after explaining to a couple of his friends that he never even got touched, let alone jumped, by anyone, they still wanted revenge over something that I didn't even do. Fast forward to right now, I am paranoid and depressed. I don't live in a really ghetto environment, but it certainly has its bad apples. I have not ran into the guy or any of his friends since that day, but I still fear the day that I do. I have been having this feeling/thought these past 3 weeks that I am going to get killed over this lie. I don't want to die. I have gotten over what they did to me and I just want to move on with my life. I have a loving and supportive family and girlfriend. Those people are my focus and inspiration. Why did I have to get stuck with this burden of having to watch my back? I avoid certain places because of the higher risk of running into one of those jerks. When I can't avoid these ""higher risk"" places, I get pretty anxious and immediately start scanning faces until I leave those places. I always keep thinking of the worst. For example, I sometimes think about me having to work at a retail store at some point in my life and having to see one of these guys again. I am afraid that they will confront me and finish off what they never got to finish. I honestly feel like they would kill me. Even I know I sound kind of crazy as I am typing this, but that is honestly how I think and feel. My loved ones are always telling me that these guys could care less about me at this point and that I am just anxious and overly paranoid, which I am. However, like I tell my loved ones, we do not know how long and bad of a grudge these guys might hold against me. Sure, some of them might have completely forgotten about that whole ordeal and just brushed it off as some high school drama and have other things in life to worry about, but what if some of his other friends have nothing better to do than to bring me down, even after high school has ended? I don't want to live like this. Always thinking about the ""what if?"" I like to see myself as a nice guy. I try to make people around me happy. I go out of my way to help those around me. I find myself constantly asking to whomever controls this life, ""Why me? Why do I deserve this mental torture?""

Usually my nightmares are related to the situation that happened and the way people in my life have been reacting to it. Last night was the second time I had a nightmare about him. My mom and I were arguing and arguing over and over again and at some point he came up to me and cut my throat. That's the simplest way to describe what it was about. I had been having suicidal thoughts, feeling like I was worthless and that I'd never amount to anything beyond what I am now, because of my health. The other dream was about him dragging me into my room by my sides away from everyone I love in the living room.
In real life he never hurt me and I was never the victim but he hurt someone I love very badly and it tore the family apart. He still lives with us when my sister is away and she'll be gone for two weeks. I just feel overwhelmed and confused. I'm really jumpy all of the time and I'm worried something is going on.

b00dox,How to deal with people asking the wrong questions about your PTSD?,"So ive experienced this a couple of times lately, and I'm wondering whether I should have said something/should say something in the future...

I have to see a person at this place for employment advice/support finding a job with my mental health issues. 

I've told him in the past that I have PTSD, anxiety, and depression (because I have to, I'm on benefits and if I don't do this I may lose them). A couple of appointments ago when I saw him... he asked why I had PTSD, right, which I get why he'd be curious, but it's hard to talk about, you know? So I try and be purposefully evasive, because honestly it gives me anxiety when anyone even mentions it, by simply saying ""it was from a medical procedure"". He wouldn't accept it though, and was staring me directly and unblinkingly in the eyes and demanding I tell him exactly why. Not super forceful, but enough that it was making me more and more anxious and uncomfortable until I eventually just gave in described it to him. He seemed to drop it after that, (and then proceeded to ask me ""so why are you feeling anxious right now?""  Which I just... *facepalm* are you aware how triggers work, asshole?!)

I get that he's not a therapist. I get that his job is probably more focussed on helping people overcome physical health issues as they search for jobs, rather than mental, but like... thats not okay, right? I've been sitting on it for a while and honestly I don't wanna go to that place anyway, but I have to, but... yeah.

Should I maybe say something? To him, or someone else? (The other person I see there is just as bad honestly though so I dont hold out much hope trying to speak to another person). The damage to me is already done, but if I say something it could maybe stop him doing it to someone else and triggering them too? Idk..

He did it again last time I saw him, just with my anxiety though, staring at me and demanding I tell him ""why I'm anxious"", but you can't always put that shit into words, right??

Those lyrics have become my silent mantra to remind myself that I have made it through 30+ years of this and I have kept going. I was dx with complex PTSD when i was 38 (im 43 now) after years of having the dx of Agorophobia with Panic disorder and Bipolar II disorder. I lived through a lot of physical, emotional, and psychological abuse growing up. I am the oldest of 4 kids. My mom got pregnant with me when she was 15, and got married when she was 16. I was born 18 days after the wedding, 2 months premature. Growing up my mom never once let me forget that fact that I was ""an accident"" and that I ruined her life life, and that she had no problem threatening on taking me to an orphanage when i misbehaved. My next sibling was born when i was 8, and was very much planned, as were my second brother (i was 13) and my sister (i was 18!). The treatment, and shows of affection, between me and my two brothers was vastly different then mine. i'm not sure about my sister as I had been thrown out of the house/joined the Army by the time she was born. My brothers were disciplined, but I was beaten. They got yelled at, I got screamed at how i was worthless, unwanted, and hated. They were loved, I was tortured emotionally and psychologically, and bullied. I had a miserable experience. I tried to hang myself at age 16 only to have my mom walk in, laugh at me, and then slap me repeatedly for ""being so stupid that I couldn't kill myself right"". It was a joke to her. I was a joke. I grew up feeling very alone, bullied at home and at school. 

When I finally left home at 17 and joined the Army i tried so hard to do something, anything, to gain some approval from my parents. No mater what I accomplished, no matter how hard I tried, I received nothing. They didn't come to my basic training graduation, too busy. They didn't come to graduation from Airborne school, too far to drive and they didn't want to waste money flying down. When I'd deploy they'd never respond to the letters I sent. When I got hurt and was in the hospital, they didn't call or visit. Years later I learned that they would go on cruises and to Disney every year with my siblings, yet they could never visit me. After i got out of the army, I got married. They didn't meet my wife until 2 years later when they had a layover at the airport for a Disney trip and we drove to see them. When my son was born I called them and was congratulated, but they never came to see him. They didn't meet their only grandchild until he was 3. They have seen him a total of 3 times since he was born. 

&amp;#x200B;

I attempted suicide again when I was 23. I have the scar on my wrist as a constant reminder. I contemplated a third time when I was 30. I have nightmares almost every night. I can't go to Walmart alone without breaking into a cold sweat, trembling and puking in the parking lot. I isolate myself from the few friends I have out of fear. I am paranoid that people are talking about me, that my wife of 20 years is going to abandon me, and that my son hates me. I cry out of nowhere more days then I care to count. Recently I was hospitalized again for having weeks straight panic attacks to the point I couldn't leave the house. I often feel broken, worthless, and hopeless inside. A lot days I wish I was dead.

But I won't back down. I've had a dance with death, and found myself wanting to live. I've endured relentless abuse from my parents, but I refuse to be like them and do nothing but cherish, love, and support my own child. I treat my wife the way I want to be treated and she responds in kind. I am starting to realize that I am loved. I am wanted. I am a good person. I've had some horrible downs in my life, but I strive for the greatest ups. I wake up every day and tell myself that its a new beginning. That is all I can ask for. I take it one day at a time. I endure. For my wife. For my son. and most importantly for me.

Took sick days for today and tomorrow, because the withdrawal symptoms are crazy, bad, out of my mind prolonged panic. My ribs are so. sore. from all the muscle contraction.

b01onn,Dating a man who was abused as a child and has PTSD from war...need advice.,"Hi all! So I'm new-ish to the Reddit scene. I'm going to give you some background to the story first and then ask for your input. I'm hoping a few of you might be able to steer me in the right direction as far as how to be supportive.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been seeing/talking to a guy I used to work with since December. He is two years younger than me. Divorced and has 4 children. His mother is currently suffering from terminal cancer. So right off the bat, he has a LOT on his plate.

&amp;#x200B;

He is also a veteran. He was involved in a very bad accident while at war and was medically discharged from the army about three years ago. I feel that I should also mention that he was horribly abused as a child and it did not stop until he was adopted at age 14.

&amp;#x200B;

We began talking in early December and hit it off right away. We have a lot in common. 

I noticed a few things- first, he shakes whenever we touch. More so when he hugs me. I've been doing some research and read that this could be a tension release thing for PTSD? Has anyone heard of this?

Second, he does not like to communicate via phone number, only via Instagram messenger. I have his number and rarely use it. Initially, I thought this was weird. And this may have nothing to do with his PTSD, but I felt it was worth a mention.

Every once in a while we have a weird encounter. Like, he will call me at 4am and tell me he is on my way to my house because he needs someone to talk to. Or I'll FaceTime him and he's sitting in the dark. 

Sometimes he has to cancel our plans because he has life stuff going on, but it's SO unbelievable that it almost has to be true. I also think some of this may come from anxiety. Trust me, I get the life stuff. I don't know how he does it sometimes.

We talk pretty much all day, so I'm not worried that there's someone else, I'm just looking for advice on how I can get him to open up or how I can be more supportive. I care very much about this man and want him to feel comfortable being with me and around me. I want to ask him more about his past but also don't want to trigger anything.

Can anyone help? If you need more information, I'm happy to give it. Just let me know!",brinkleycf,2019-03-11 18:21:34,6,457,20.7,77.15,28.02,19.26,12.69,11.6,93,61.05,21.44,15.1,7.44,1.31,0.88,5.47,0,6.35,4.6,13.79,12.69,5.91,9.63,1.09,20.57,5.25,2.41,1.53,1.75,3.5,5.25,2.41,2.84,1.09,0.88,0.22,15.97,0.44,0.22,0.22,6.13,13.13,1.97,2.19,2.19,4.6,1.09,2.19,1.97,0.66,0.44,0.88,0.88,0,0.88,0,0,6.78,2.63,1.09,2.19,0.44,0.66,3.72,14.22,2.19,13.57,0.88,6.13,6.35,0.66,0.44,0.22,0.22,0,0.44,0.22,0,0.22,0,0,0,17.29,7.44,2.63,0,1.31,0.66,0.44,0.44,0,2.84,0,1.53

b046my,Need some advice. My partner has PTSD and is struggling immensely.,"Long story short, I love this woman immensely. Been with her 12 years. I had a little work-related stress breakdown a few months ago and that triggered her. I wasn’t there to take care of her for a while. I’m getting better, slowly. She’s been struggling with her PTSD from childhood sexual abuse and flashbacks to the point she doesn’t know if she even wants to continue our relationship. We had our first couples’ counseling session and she admitted that as much as she’d love to say, “Yes, I’d love you to,” when I ask if I can kiss her (trying to respect her boundaries), she can’t get herself out of her stuck place.


So what I would like to do is make a little board for her (and say she doesn’t have to use it if she doesn’t want) that has two columns: Today I’m Okay With... and Today I Am Not Okay With... and have little magnets with things on it that she can move around like “hugs,” “kisses (I initiate),” “kisses (you initiate),” “snuggles,” “hand-holding,” “saying I love you,” those kinds of things. I’m thinking of preparing this and showing her and saying she doesn’t have to do this but I thought it would help her feel safe in her boundaries. She can do any of the things on the board at any time, this would just be for me to know how she’s feeling (if she knows that day.) And I want to let her know it’s okay, it’s not her fault and wherever she is (friends, lovers, in-between), I’ll meet her there.


Please advise; I am terrified of doing the wrong thing with her.

b0538h,Managed to secure work!!,"Many here are struggling with the basics of life and I can relate better than most. The issues I have had with work, relationships and family are numerous but now at 33 I am coming to terms with the affective nature of ASD/PTSD on present situations manifesting as extreme events of emotional instability.

I mentioned in a previous thread that I am now engaged to a wonderful woman. This isn’t a rose-tinted glasses situation, this woman knows me through and through and has been incredibly patient throughout my recovery, and hasn’t been afraid to speak her mind and tell me how things are, even if it risks upsetting me because the truth of a situation can hurt sometimes. We’ve been at the bottom together almost breaking up but decided as one last shot to let out barriers down, trust each other, really go for it and now we have a future planned.

Furthermore I have recently been offered a job that is well paid, in the right industry and senior, albeit one that I have done and failed at before adding to my already colourful trauma portfolio. I am due to see my psychiatrist tomorrow and start the therapy I need to move on successfully but I am definitely excited about this and can’t wait to start. 

I hope others can see that there is and will always be a light at the end of a tunnel and to not give up or ignore the signs of your trauma.

b05a2a,"Fuck sex abuse, but fuck acting like you're A-OKAY","I only realized and recovered memories of the sexual abuse (6th grade teacher) in 2016. Been in therapy for about 2 years and constantly recovering repressed memories.


It is so fucking difficult to go to therapy every Tuesday afternoon and go to my night job (bartending) 2 hours later and act like nothing is wrong.


It is hard to hide therapy/healing when my regulars ask me, ""What's new with you?"" And I can't tell them I am safely recovering from abuse -- Not because I'm ashamed, but because saying, ""I am coping with childhood sex abuse"" is such a DOWNER.


Fuck the fact that because I don't have PROOF, 12 YEARS AFTER I WAS ABUSED, I can't take my pedophile abuser to court. It makes legal sense, I know. But he raped me in his classroom, on my own desk, and there will NEVER be justice. Never. I will never have evidence he abused me. And even if he went to jail for decades, it will never make up what he took from me.


I am strong, smart, and determined. I can cope with my torture. But hiding it to not make other people sad and not being able to prosecute my pedophile abuser is what destroys me the most.",kea5223,2019-03-12 01:20:10,12,220,17.39,5.6,85.21,1,14.67,15.91,91.82,56.36,18.64,14.09,10.45,0,0.91,2.27,0.45,4.55,2.27,11.36,10,5.45,8.64,5,17.27,5,2.27,1.82,1.82,0.91,11.82,2.73,9.09,0.91,6.82,0.45,5.45,0,0,0,2.27,15,3.18,2.73,0.45,0.91,3.64,5,1.36,0,0.45,0.45,5.45,0,1.82,3.64,0,8.18,0,2.27,2.73,0.91,2.27,2.27,13.64,1.36,11.36,1.36,2.27,7.73,2.73,0,0,0,0,0,2.27,1.82,0,0.45,0,0,20,5.91,5.45,0,0,0.45,0,1.36,1.82,2.73,1.82,0.45

I walked away and let him cool off and shortly after he came up behind me and we held each other and he apologized over and over again. We’re in this together, we’re a team. I won’t lie, sometimes it’s insanely hard but being in bed next to him and thinking about how we got through yesterday together makes it all worth it. 

We weren’t together during his deployments in Afghanistan so I don’t even know half of what he’s been through or what he’s had to do.

b07qii,I hate when nightmares are of unrelated people but equally as traumatizing,"For the last 3 years or so, I kept having trauma nightmares of my ex best friend who ditched me rather epically after I was raped and while developing ptsd. They’ve started to subside, finally, maybe I can actually work on processing that and move past it once and for all. But now my brain has moved on to targeting an ex boyfriend of mine who isn’t related to my trauma, in fact he was the first to call it was it was and call me out on victim blaming myself after the fact. He’s dating someone right now so we’re not talking, but my brain is using this hiatus as an opportunity to dredge up insecurities and slam me into the ground with them.

I woke up at 3:37am this morning with one of the worst trauma nightmares of him, though it pales in comparison to those of the perp and those related to the trauma. Still, it was enough for me to not want to go back to sleep and risk continuing the dream. 

I wish trauma nightmares had boundaries, I’ve had dreams like these about every single person in my life, past and present, even people I haven’t spoken to in over 10 years. No one is safe. And after these, I’m in a terrible mood all day and I avoid the person(s) like the plague until the feelings pass. It doesn’t help talking to the people about the dreams, they always think I have control over my dreams and I really feel they’re going to do whatever it is they did in the dream. Like no, if I could control my dreams, I wouldn’t have had them in the first place. Weed doesn’t help me, it interacts with my psychotic disorder whether it’s cbd or not. Anti anxiety meds will put me back to sleep which is the opposite of what I want. So, I suffer until I forget.

b09q39,Boundaries and Parents (Semi Rant and Seeking Advice),"Hi all, 

I have PTSD and anxiety and have been working with my Therapist to not only set boundaries but also put myself first (I tend to put others before my needs and burn out). Boy is it hard. 

I  had a rough month last month. Got hired on into a new job, Dad was diagnosed with cancer and had surgery. Fiancé went through issues that triggered his anxiety and on top of all of that I’m working on healing from my trauma and all the spin offs from it (I’m a assault survivor and the anniversary just happened).  I’m going through some of the darker parts of what happened in therapy and it’s draining on me. 

Also add that my mom leans on me for support and I had to talk her down from anxiety in relation to my dad while trying to deal with my own pain and emotions from it.

Rough month right? 

I finally hit a wall, I just needed a break.  I had to be strong with all that was going on and it hit me hard.  And yesterday I felt that straw break.  

In the middle of all the craziness that was happening at work yesterday, my mom calls me...my step grandmother has cancer (bone) and I just couldn’t. I didn’t want to hear it at that time.  I had shut down. 

I couldn’t provide the logic my mom wanted to hear. She didn’t even listen to me when I asked her to stop. She just kept going on and on about what cancer it was and what may happen next and how everyone is upset.  I actually snapped and yelled stop. I told her I could not process right now and that I need a break. I asked to let me had the night and we can talk about it the next day.  

Her response was to tell me that “I could just find out about it myself” and hung up on me. 

I’m angry, hurt and shutting down, please tell me others have felt this way too.

When I got home that night, I saw that his door was closed but the light was on. Saw that our two dogs, who normally sleep with him, were in the living room. Didn’t think anything of it. Went to bed and had a thought of “well what if he killed himself?”  Don’t know why I had that thought cross my mind. 

*TW* 
I found him the next morning when I heard his alarm going off (he’s got this alarm with a device that goes under your pillow. When it goes off, the device vibrates. I’m used to his alarms, but when it went off that morning, it sounded like it was hitting wood). I got up and saw that the dogs were whining, still in the living room. I opened his door... and found him. It was a clean scene. Blood on his face and on the carpet. He used a gun, and a hollow point type round. No exit wound. I remember closing the door. Rushing over to him. Checking his neck for a pulse. Nothing. Trying to check his left arm for a pulse. Couldn’t move it. Touching his face, getting his blood on my hands. Turning off his alarm. Seeing that his phone was ringing, my mom was calling him to make sure he was awake. Answering and telling her he was gone. Her anguished wail. I remember seeing a sticky note that had his phone code and just said “to my family, I’m sorry”. I remember leaving the room, in complete shock. Washing his blood off my hands. Calling my dad, who was out of town on a school trip. His pain. Calling 911. Watching as the fire department arrived first. My mom shortly after. Her screams as they let her see him there. The cops showing up shortly after. I can remember later that day, I was at my dads (I lived in a condo, my dad lived in another condo in the same complex). I remember him getting home after he was able to get the next flight back. I remember him going to the door of the spare room and him punching a hole through the door. 
*TW* 

This whole thing doesn’t seem real. My overall reaction feels different than my parents. I still cry. But, I’m also not sure how to feel. I feel like I’m staring off into space most of the time. I can hardly sleep, getting the bare minimum. Its like I’m afraid of reliving that moment. It’s like I’m afraid I’ll wake up and find another loved one gone. I still picture the moment I found him. I still feel like I have his blood on my hands. I feel like I’m in some sort of horrible dream. I can still hear my moms anguished wail when I told her. I can still hear my dads scream. 

*Note* 
I should note that I do have an appointment with a therapist i used to see a few years ago, and I am not a therapist so it’s pure speculation",EFIRE23,2019-03-12 09:25:29,11,541,43.35,50,77.38,3.23,9.84,12.38,92.79,55.82,23.48,17.74,9.98,0.18,0.37,7.02,0.18,5.73,6.47,12.2,7.95,4.25,4.81,1.48,19.96,3.7,2.96,1.85,1.11,1.11,4.25,0.92,3.33,1.29,0.18,0.74,12.57,1.85,0.18,1.48,7.02,9.98,4.07,1.29,0.74,1.85,0.92,1.66,6.47,2.4,2.03,2.22,5.18,2.96,1.85,0,0,5.55,1.29,0.74,1.11,1.66,0.92,9.06,7.39,0.55,17.56,2.77,9.06,5.91,0.37,0.37,3.14,0,0,0.37,0.18,0,0,0,0.18,0,19.59,9.98,3.51,0,0,0.18,0,0,0.74,2.96,0.74,1.48
b0a7tu,PTSD and Survivor’s Guilt,"I’m a first responder. I’ve had PTSD from a young age due to trauma completely unrelated to the service. PTSD only worsened and paired itself with survivors guilt after a particularly gruesome fatal call. It’s only been a few months since that call, but it has haunted me since it was over. Comes with the job, I know, and believe me I love my job more than anything.

Been having obscene nightmares recently mostly centered around death. There’s one in particular I had that sticks out to me the most that tipped me off that maybe the nightmares are related to the call.

Destroyed a potential relationship with someone I really liked because the sleep medication I was on made me sound like a drunk idiot and I wouldn’t remember the next day spouting off and being fucking stupid. I’m off it now, but the damage is done, and makes me feel even lower. Not sure there’s any saving it.

Anyway. Not sure why I’ve decided to write this out here. Sometimes it’s easier to talk to strangers than to the people in your everyday life. I feel like I’m losing the battle right now but I am definitely making an effort to stay in it.",farroness,2019-03-12 10:05:16,2,210,52.71,15.86,95.88,1,14,16.19,95.24,60.48,17.62,10,9.52,0,0.48,0,0,7.62,8.1,14.76,10.95,8.1,4.76,1.43,18.1,7.14,5.24,0.48,0.95,1.9,10.48,2.86,7.62,0.95,2.38,0.95,5.24,0,0,0,0,18.1,3.81,3.33,0.48,3.81,2.86,3.81,1.43,0,0.48,0.95,2.86,0.48,0.95,0.48,0.48,6.19,0.95,2.86,2.38,0,0.48,5.24,11.43,0.48,14.76,0.95,7.14,7.14,2.38,0.48,0,0.48,0,0.95,1.43,0.95,0,0,0,0.48,14.29,6.67,2.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.24,0,0
b0bfu9,An update and i hope this brings confidence to reader:),"20 F. I posted a little while ago, but long story short i was s assaulted (idk if it needs an NSFW tag). I took this year off from college. 
I see a therapist, EMDR, and an APRN. Finally found the right meds, I’m currently waiting on my medical marijuana card (for nightmares), and i have gone through most of my processing for EMDR. 
I haven’t been this content in years. My confidence is building back up, the triggers are fading. I know I’m not “cured” yet and i still have a ways to go, but I’m sick of being the victim of depression, anxiety, ptsd. Its too early in my life to give up.

b0bpvc,CBD Oil feels like a miracle,I've started to use CBD oil to manage my anxiety and I feel like a person again. I have energy to both accept any negative feelings I have and still put out a positivity to other people. Which is something I struggle with when my anxiety is fully active since it pulls me down and it's difficult for me not to come off nasty when all my energy is spent fighting anxious thoughts and coping with the feelings it creates. I have an easier time talking myself down from my anxious thoughts and can function better in public in general. I can focus when I read and not forget things because I don't have my brain going a mile a minute. This stuff makes me feel like my life has changed drastically.

b0c559,Barley coping,"I haven’t posted in this forum before because I was always told ptsd is something someone deals with after fighting in a war. But I’ve seen my psychiatrist for over a year now and that’s what I’m in the category of. The last five years have been really hard for me. My grandmother who basically raised us got diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. Late stages because they couldn’t diagnose the cancer because there was so much of it. I helped take care of her until she passed. My other grandmother also passed away from breast cancer and my grandfather passed away from a heart attack after getting a triple bypass surgery. (I should add since I’ve been little I’ve been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression disorder). My brother found him and tried to resuscitate him but it was too late my brother was 15 and now at 17 is very depressed and suicidal which is very hard to deal with being terrified of losing him as well. But that’s not what my ptsd is from. I had a dog he was my life he was the one who calmed my anxiety and kept me level headed, we took him to a kennel to get groomed and when I went to go and pick him up they had put him in a tiny cage ( he was a 120 pound golden retriever) I the summer out side. He fought his way out of it and when I found him he was bloody and barely breathing. The owner of the kennel didn’t know what happened and we both carried him to the car I was in full panic mode screaming, we rushed him to the vet but on the way there he passed away. I was a mess for a long time. Fast forward to now, we got another dog she’s amazing she’s now almost three. A few months ago I gave her a carrot thinking nothing of it, an hour later I find her laying on the ground drooling everywhere not moving and I freak out I start pacing and panicking. She ended up throwing up and was still out of it but a little better. We had to wait till the morning to take her to the Vet and they said she is perfectly fine she just had a very bad reaction to it. A few weeks later she got off her leash and it was -30 out and it took an hour for us to catch her. She wasn’t feeling good again that night and we took her to the vet and again they said she’s perfectly fine she just was in the cold for too long so she wasn’t feeling well. She got sick one more time after that just a freak reaction allergy’s. again the vet gave her Benadryl and she was fine. So 1000$ later and then saying she’s 100% healthy I can’t leave my room or look at her anymore. Every time I do I go back to when I found my dog at the kennel. Every little noise I hear makes me thing someone going to come and tell me she’s died. I plan In my head constantly her dying and how I’m going to deal with it. I can’t sleep, I have constant panic attacks my mind just won’t stop telling me somethings wrong with her. I’ll watch her breathing and thing it’s wrong or when she’s sleeping I’ll think she’s dying. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m going crazy. I have a psychiatrist and it feels like it’s not helping. I’ve been on meditation and it’s not helping. I just want to feel normal again and feel like I can have friends over and go out. But I just have panic attacks. I want my life back.",DakotaD2488,2019-03-12 12:46:24,2,641,21.53,46.88,75.38,5.66,17.81,10.61,92.82,61.93,23.09,17.78,8.89,1.25,0,7.02,0.62,5.3,5.62,12.48,10.14,6.4,8.27,2.18,20.9,4.84,2.03,1.87,1.72,1.56,6.24,2.18,4.06,1.09,0.94,0.47,12.64,0.78,0.16,4.84,2.96,9.98,2.81,1.4,0.62,1.25,1.09,3.12,2.96,0.47,0.94,1.4,3.12,1.4,1.72,0.16,0,7.02,1.72,0.94,1.72,2.5,0.78,8.74,10.61,1.25,17.94,3.43,7.18,8.11,0,0.16,0.16,0,0.16,0.78,0.78,0.47,0,0,0.31,0,12.17,5.46,0.78,0,0,0,0,0.16,0,4.84,0.62,0.31

As many know, PTSD affects your ability to be present to your own body. That's been my case all my life. 

I've never been much for exercise or intentional activities that are physical. Well just recently I have been on a fitness program, and I  hired a personal trainer at the gym. Been doing that for almost 3 months now, working out and building muscle and strength 3 days a week. 

*I can't even believe the difference*. I feel so much more confident and calm, I can feel my muscles emering in my body!

Rape, sexual assault, and PTSD do not know fame, race, or gender. At any given time, over 13 MILLION Americans have PTSD. Meanwhile, over 14,000 military members report sexual assault every year.

It’s estimated that 83% of military sexual assaults go unreported, meaning there could be upwards of 82,500 military sexual assaults happening PER YEAR. Since my own military sexual assault in the Marines, 3 months before 9/11, there have been approximately 1.4 MILLION other victims in the military alone. 

Over the past few weeks, I have had the privilege of joining and chatting with numerous social media groups formed to support PTSD and Military Sexual Trauma (MST) survivors.

There are thousands in these groups, yet there are millions more suffering on their own. PTSD, after all, is an invisible condition. We fight the battle ourselves, unable to share what happened. The result is self-imposed isolation and a self-fulfilling prophecy. We feel alone, so we become alone.

To show those that there is hope even though the battle wages on, and to help PTSD survivors and their families, I am sharing my story.

My story is not unique. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I share this story to let others know they are supported, they are loved, they are not alone, and they too can thrive with PTSD.

In my 17+ years of living with PTSD from MST, I have struggled and I have persisted. Some days are much easier than others. One thing I found helpful to me is keeping an active mind. The more occupied my mind, the less space there is for my trauma to rent in my head.

In the constant effort to keep my mind stimulated, I have found myself doing some pretty interesting things. Some have led to joy, some have led to pain. After years on this journey, I have decided to write a book about my experience.

This book is currently in pre-order sales and will be for the next 24 hours. The journey offers some parallels to The Alchemist and Forrest Gump, though this journey is true.

Your support would go a long way to ensure this story gets told and the conversation around PTSD really gets started. [https://publishizer.com/relentless-1/](https://publishizer.com/relentless-1/) . 

Help me help the masses understand this condition so that the silent suffering of millions can end.

b0hh40,[TW: DV &amp; Police] Sharing a poem I wrote about PTSD :),"Hi! Long time commenter, first time poster.

My PTSD has been in high gear lately, so to cope, I wrote a poem about it. I feel like it's such a difficult disorder to properly describe, and sometimes it's easier to convey through art. I'd like to share with y'all, because I think there might be parts we can all relate to.

**Here's the poem -** [**An abuser survivor's take: PTSD is...**](https://medium.com/one-survivor-story/poem-an-abuse-survivors-take-ptsd-is-1b7c8c5095d)

&amp;#x200B;

Some teasers:

&gt;PTSD is being wary of stepping outside somedays, because your startle response is so revved up that the sound of someone dumping a bag of trash on the sidewalk can sound like an outright bomb.  
&gt;  
&gt;PTSD is constantly feeling like you have to explain yourself in an alien language.  
&gt;  
&gt;PTSD is having an anxiety attack anytime you receive a call from “No Caller ID” or “Scam Likely” because cops and DAs *never* reveal their numbers when you’re a suspect.

b0hxzz,Is it possible for PTSD issues to come back seemingly randomly years after resolving them?,"7 years ago, I got hit by a car while I was getting off of my school bus. There was a vicious thunderstorm, and the driver who ran into me had no headlights on, so I couldn’t see him until it was too late. This caused me to experience many trademarks of PTSD(I say “trademarks” because I never got officially diagnosed), such as being terrified of moving traffic of any kind, hearing any car horns, or even getting panic attacks from thunderstorms. After a while, most of these symptoms just went away, and I’ve been living pretty well after.
Fast forward to March 2nd of this year, I was at a Mardi Gras parade where I had a bit much to drink. I was having quite a fantastic time throughout the parade, and I can’t think of anything bad about it. 
After everything closed, my girlfriend, who was the designated driver, and I were walking back to her car to head home. We looked both ways and began crossing the street, when a car suddenly came my way. I thought I was gonna get hit again, and I just completely froze up. During this, I was having one of the most vivid flashbacks of my accident that I’ve had in years, which was then followed by a massive panic attack. Once I calmed down a half hour later, my girlfriend informed me that the car wasn’t even moving that quickly and stopped to let everyone cross the street, but it didn’t feel like that to me. 
Ever since that parade, my nightmares, panic attacks, and crippling fears of moving traffic as well as having similar reactions to moving vehicles came back to me in full force. I’m even beginning to freak out when thunderstorms approach(this is pretty important to note because I a few years after my accident, I began to enjoy watching the rain while also enjoying the sounds of the thunder). 
For all I know, it could be my mind playing tricks on me or something, but I’m pretty convinced that these symptoms have returned. 
Is it a normal thing for people who have seemingly gotten over past trauma to slip back into PTSD related to the traumatic event years later?

b0hz4f,Is ptsd really always valid? (tw),"I don't mean to sound pathetic, but I have a friend who says my mental health issues and reactions to certain things are ""valid"" and my ""ptsd"" is real but I don't believe her. I never went to war, I was never seriously assaulted, my parents weren't the worst. In most areas, I had it much better than others. I'm not sure if this is just me being stupid or if she really is overly pitying me.

For context, essentially the main things are I was introduced to sex really young and would sext with adults from ages 7-15ish, and I'm not sure but I remember a birthday party when I was like 6 where the kid's dad might've done something but idk. Also, my parents have always had their faults, like my mom yelled at me a lot and my dad was always working, I was never really allowed friends, they separated my brother and I from our extended family, I was always treated like a slightly shittier version of my brother, privacy was never age appropriate, etc etc etc. I guess the worst it got was when I was 14 and I came out and both of my parents, particularly my mother, were very.. uh.. rude. for several years. 

I started rambling, sorry, I'm not really good with talking about this stuff, I always go off and end up saying too much and making it look worse than it was. 

I guess what I'm saying is, for some people, could even small stuff really give you actual ptsd, even if it's an over reaction?

b0j80p,Anger,"Hi. My PTSD was caused by 15 years of physical, verbal, and emotional abuse from family. I've left home and I've been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for the past 2-3 years. I've also been avoiding my family for those years. I only show up when I absolutely *have* to, like birthdays and special events. If it hadn't been for therapy, they would never see me again. 

My question is, how do I deal with all of this anger? I feel like I could destroy the people I'm mad at, and it's such BS that I'm not supposed to hurt people.

I NAMED it! This is PTSD and I’m triggered.
I told him it’s not his fault! He didn’t cause this, he hasn’t done anything wrong.
I let him know I needed some space.

b0kfj1,Wondering if I have PTSD or not.,"Hello, first of all, I apologise for my bad English and grammar. I have a question because I literally have nobody here to answer me this and the place I'm living isn't exactly helpful when it come to this..

I have been wondering if I have PTSD? My experiences weren't exactly terrible as many people here, I believe because I've never been beaten up physically or sexually abuse. Still is it even possible for a person that have been terribly bullied both mentally and verbally to suffer PTSD? I am wondering here because I keep experience terrible and sometimes strange dreams until now.. And they the bullies keep appearing in the dreams and it always make me wake up feeling unpleasant and scared most of the times. I thought I have move on from it a long time ago, but no.. they still appear in my dream and each time they appeared, it always they are taunting me and humiliated me. 

I also have an uncontrollable outburst.. especially when any of my family members talking about a situation that I can relate to (eg: ""children bullying each other are normal, just a silly kid thing, they will grow out of it soon"") or mentioning those bullies name and claiming them as my ""friend"", I will suddenly panicking, get irritated and begin to raging for no reason and my family will be shocked and I'm usually a quiet and stoic person. I also have a frequent flashback of my school days almost every fucking time. It suddenly appears for no fucking reason and because the flashback and my school days tend to unpleasant, I keep trying to have a good thought instead so it will vanish, but no... It keeps appearing... and I don't quiet understand it. 

I also tend to be avoidance for so long already as I tend to avoid going to any events as I'm afraid that I will any of the bullies there. I withdraw myself from many activities and giving many excuses if anyone in my family wants to hang out with me. I still go out but alone and refuse accompany almost 99% of the times. The only times when I feel want to be accompanied is when I feel paranoid for no reason and is keep having bad thoughts .. but then, whenever something like that happens, I tend to prefer to stay home. 

I've read and take numerous PTSD tests... But I'm not sure if I'm really one, who's know that I'm actually just a sensitive fragile person ? I've been wanting to meet a therapist, but I don't have many resources here... and I don't even know if there's any therapist here... I'm not living in Europe or US, instead I live in Asia where mental issues is view as a taboo here.. and the facts that I'm bullied is just a normal thing and every kids experience it so it doesn't matter and I wasn't even beaten up to death, so I'm fine. That's what I've been told often, but for the rest of you... I'm wondering here if someone that was bullied verbally+mentally can experience PTSD or I just simply being overreacting and being a sensitive idiot ?",sanonraus,2019-03-13 03:32:31,2,543,8.94,9.88,90.11,1,90.5,17.86,93.37,60.41,18.23,12.34,10.87,0.18,0.18,0,1.1,5.89,4.42,9.94,11.23,9.21,12.34,3.13,20.26,5.16,1.29,1.47,0.55,2.76,6.08,1.1,4.97,1.66,1.47,0.37,6.63,0.55,0.18,0,0,16.39,3.87,1.47,1.84,6.63,2.03,5.34,2.95,1.1,0.37,0.74,1.84,0.18,1.1,0.55,0,6.08,2.03,0.74,2.39,0.55,0.74,2.21,14.73,1.66,10.5,1.29,3.31,6.08,0.92,1.1,0.74,0,0,0.18,0.55,0.55,0,0,0,0,18.05,7.92,3.31,0.18,0,0.74,0,0,0.74,4.42,0.37,0.37

I experienced a tramtic event that put me into a black hole and iIam just now starting to feel better. BUT even on my best days, i still experience constant ringing in my ears. It can be a real low frequency to very loud but it is always there. I've been to the ear, nose and throat doctor to make sure it was nothing serious and everything checked out fine but they diagnosed me with Tinnitus.

Does anyone else with PTSD or Panic disorder have this all the time? Did anyone else's tramatic event set off the ringing?

b0ojuh,New to Reddit and looking for people who have PTSD aswell,"So I have heard about reddit having a lot of different communities and set ups so I guessed no harm in taking a look.

I'm 20 years and I have suffered with PTSD for as long as I can remember and last year finally got my doctor to listen and confirm it. When this happend I thought as my mental illness had a name to it people could understand it would make it easier to find friends or speak to others with it. Appears not. From where I'm from its almost never heard of or seen as labeled wrong to have PTSD not coursed by war so I get looked at like an alien a lot. 

I haven't found anyone who can understand what I mean when I say I get Flash backs, nightmares, stresser triggers or sometimes responses I can't control sometimes. So coming on here and finding a whole sub reddit of people who have what I have was a relief for me. 

So, I wanted to say hello and I hope I can make friends here. Maybe vent a little and ask for help with episodes , currently still learning how to cope with it all due to life being a bit relentless with the bad luck lately.

b0q0fc,PTSD and PhD,"Hello all, I'm not sure what to say or even where to start but here goes! Not sure how to reach out.

I just started a PhD a few months ago and obviously under a lot of stress from that. I've had really bad anxiety for as long as I can remember and my legs are covered with scars plus a suicide attempt, so during my PhD I thought I'd start reaching out to my doctor and I was quickly put on antidepressants and started counselling. I've always known I've had bad mental health but now I have therapists saying they're not qualified enough to help me and my GP repeatedly recommending I increase my dose and start taking other medication as well! My doctors and therapists all agree that I have post traumatic stress but I didn't know why. Before my diagnosis one therapist said I seem to have repressed something but i wasn't sure what. Then I remembered I was a young teenager growing up in a country during a war though never thought much of it, since I never saw an outrageously traumatic event during it, but now I understand it's because of the war. Now it feels like I'm carrying a huge weight all the time with memories and emotions coming up, bad sleep, and flashbacks (which before I thought were just panic attacks). Also I'm overwhelmed with anger and I reaaaaly want to get into a fight!! which is really frustrating.

This is all a bit confusing and especially since I'm in my very early 20s. I'm not really sure what to think of it or what to do.

Now I have a deadline in two days, I just left a long term and long distance relationship, and I have a full PhD Infront of me, with all of this happening in the space of a couple months.

b0qti0,CBD advice?," 

Has anyone here used CBD for anxiety? I just got out of a week long stay in the hospital because my PTSD and Agoraphobia w/Panic disorder flared up rather severely. I get all my care via the Veterans Affairs medical system and they won't prescribe me benzo's for chronic anxiety due to the dependency issue from taking it all the time. a couple of my fellow patients recommended CBD (as did one of the charge nurses off the record) as a way to deal with the acute panic attacks I have, and that it may help lessen the overwhelming anxiety I have some days. I'm leaning towards a vape pen, or edibles, but I don't really know a lot about either. I don't want to get high so marijuana suggestions aren't helpful. Just seeking testimonials, advice, etc.

I blame myself, telling myself that I asked for it, or that I should of saw it coming. Sometimes I could of got out when I had the chance, I had so many chances. I did leave at one point, but he said if I did go, he’d kill himself in the morning that there was no way I could leave. When I did leave him, I made myself stay to be friends, that it was my fault and my responsibility to watch him and make sure he was ok. That I owed him for what I caused, but I never once thought what he did to me. Because of that I let him constantly talk me down, talk about my body, tell me how worthless I am, I let him treat me like a door mat. I was only there when needed, or to have his anger taken out on, which was a daily thing. Fast forward to today, I found the love of my life, but my past is affecting our relationship. I’m scared to be yelled at, I feel like the smallest things are my fault, and that I owe him for it. Or that my body is too boney and I’m not enough.

b0s7md,Has anyone else found they are somewhat sexually apathetic due to sexual abuse at a young age?,"Just curious, my therapist told me she has noticed people who go through sexual trauma for their first sexual experience tend to not be as sexually expressionistic or motivated later in life. I was wondering if this was true?

I have found I am not as sexually motivated as most men. I still love sex even though it can be hard for me to express myself in that aspect. I tend to be attracted to the opposite sex because of emotional reasons, connections, rather than physical. It makes conversation with other males extremely difficult about the opposite sex, and I tend to just avoid it altogether.


My therapist says this is a blessing in disguise. Even though I wish I could express myself sexually easier, I don't view anyone as sexual objects and I tend to value conversation more and a persons personality. Not that being sexually abused at a young age is the only way to obtain that, but it's what I got from it. 

I never find myself motivated by sex, it's more of something I have to do, and it makes me feel alienated in society. Can anyone relate?

b0sljp,New Here! Have a question :),"Hey all! Just found this Subreddit today. My finance suffers from suspected PTSD due to childhood sexual abuse along with some other diagnosed mental illnesses (Narcissistic Personality Disorder, OCD, Bipolar Disorder, and one diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder but we’re not as sure about that one), and I had a question regarding his behavior I’m hoping someone might be able to help shed some light on. I’ve been especially concerned lately because there are some days where he seems like a completely different person. Some days he’s relatively cheerful and alert and seems normal and we have normal conversations. But some days he is so out of it that he can barely walk or stand without assistance. His speech can get slurred, he can sometimes fall, his driving skills suffer greatly. It’s like he’s heavily intoxicated, even though I know he couldn’t possibly be. Worst of all, he seems to have no idea he’s even like that. Whenever I ask him if he’s okay he just tells me he’s tired, and when I try to explain how he’s acting he has no idea what I’m talking about. It’s very scary for me and I don’t know what I can do to help other than keep him from falling and be comforting and get him to bed when necessary. I can’t discern any specific causes other than sometimes these days correlate to when he is tired or upset, but not always. Another note is that on the days where he is like this he seems more likely to wet the bed at night, which happens from time to time. Has anyone else watched someone experience this or experience it themselves? Is it potentially a symptom of PTSD or could it be because of any number of things? Any ideas on what I can do to help? I’m going to ask my therapist some questions about it during our next session, but I also wanted to hear from people who have experiences PTSD themselves or are close to people who have. Sorry, I know I just wrote a whole wall of text so I hope this all makes sense. If you have any clarification questions please don’t hesitate to ask, I’ll answer as best I can.

From when I was a kid my parents fought constantly and there was uncertainty they would stay together. Fast forward through my life I ended up with abandonment issues and shutdown when things get hard in relationships. My most recent one I’ve been dealing with tuning out conversations and spacing out.

b0tilg,TRIGGER GUN VIOLENCE &amp; SUICIDE,"-But, don’t worry everyone is safe and survives this story.-

I married my husband in 2014 in my early both in our early 20’s. Things got rocky a year later and I decided I wanted to take a break to think about ending our marriage. 

When I told him that, he went upstairs to our roommates bedroom and grabbed an unlocked, loaded gun and put it to his head. I dialed 911 and had my phone in the pocket of my hoodie without him knowing. It was 15 minutes of me begging for his life, my brain prepping me for what was to come. The was a brief moment where he considered taking my life first.

Police come into the house and I manage to get him to hand me the gun. He went into treatment and I tried my best to visit when I could for the two weeks he was in that facility. Something wasn’t quite right. My brain broke. 

About a month after I go stay with my Aunt in Virginia and then go to Florida for work. I’ve been in touch with my husband the entire time but I’ve been scared to see him. Scared to tell him where I live. I’ve bought two plane tickets that went to waste when I had a breakdown before getting on the plane. 

It’s been 3 years. Of texts and phone calls. I was diagnosed with PTSD and have been speaking with a therapist and taking some depression medicine.

Never a visit. This week I decided I can’t do it anymore. I logged into my dead Facebook account and revived after all these years. I’m trying to go through with the divorce.

Is it even possible to get back together with someone who was the source of the trauma? Can anyone relate?",Knowmarina,2019-03-13 17:13:42,0,309,54.36,46.12,89.35,7.24,12.88,14.24,90.94,56.31,21.36,15.21,10.68,0.97,0,3.56,0,6.15,5.83,14.89,8.09,3.24,5.83,1.62,19.74,3.24,1.62,2.27,2.59,1.29,2.91,0.65,2.27,0.97,0,0.65,11.97,1.94,0.32,0.32,4.21,8.74,2.27,0.65,0.65,2.27,1.29,1.62,2.27,0.32,0.97,0.97,3.56,1.29,1.94,0.32,0,8.74,3.24,1.94,1.29,2.59,0.32,7.77,8.74,0.32,18.12,4.21,6.47,8.09,0.97,0.65,0.97,0.97,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.27,7.12,1.29,0,0.32,0.65,0,0.65,0,2.91,0,0.32

b0toaz,Struggling with dissociation,"Today I was in a meeting for my school paper. My editor started talking about a situation she encountered where two guys were holding on to a girl in the road and the girl was fighting back...turned out something was wrong with her; the guys were trying to help/stop her from doing something bad and had my friend call 911, but obviously it sounded like it was going to be an assault thing at first. I was fine one second and then all of a sudden I was totally zoned out.

It's just frustrating. I don't always realize I'm dissociating unless my anxiety has been insanely high. My memory is not great (I pick up my phone and immediately forget why I picked it up), and it can be really hard to do things like focus on material I have to study for a test. Also, it's really hard because I think I may have been raped as a kid/young teen (I've had what I think are flashbacks), but I can't remember it. There's a lot of blurriness around certain times while I was being abused. It's hard to say for sure that yes, there's a gap, it's more just a sense of fogginess, if that makes sense.

How do you all cope with this? It just gets frustrating and scary sometimes. (I am on meds and seeing a therapist. Just want to hear how you all handle it in your daily lives.)",risingsun1999,2019-03-13 17:28:30,8,249,27.51,37.4,76.33,1.99,17.79,12.45,93.98,61.45,18.47,10.84,8.43,0,1.2,1.2,0,7.63,5.62,13.65,14.46,7.23,7.23,1.2,21.69,5.22,1.61,2.01,2.01,2.01,6.02,1.61,4.42,1.2,2.41,0,8.43,0,1.2,2.01,0.8,15.26,2.81,2.81,0.8,3.21,3.21,3.21,4.02,0.4,1.61,1.2,1.2,0,0.8,0.4,0,6.43,0.8,0.8,3.21,0.8,1.2,6.83,13.25,1.2,12.85,0.8,6.83,5.62,2.41,0.4,0,0,0,0,0.4,0,0,0.4,0,0,16.87,6.02,2.81,0,0.4,0.4,0,0,0,4.02,2.41,0.8
b0u475,One of the causes found and messaged me today.,"I don’t know how he found me. He messaged me with something along the lines of “Yeah shit in my life has hit the fan so I’m sorry for what i did to you” I don’t know what to do. I blocked him but I don’t believe this bullshit. He’s a manipulator. But what do I do? He found me(on Instagram) and I have no friends in common or anything and I don’t have my name on it. If he found me then my main abuser can. 

Should I ever respond? I feel like he’s going to try to manipulate this and then try and do shit against me. Do I just keep him blocked? 

I don’t hate him nearly as much as my main abuser, I knew this guy was a manipulator and I fell for it. I didn’t expect the lies, which forced me to have to go get tested and back to my ex(the main abuser) who did even worse to me. 

I’m so confused. I made an appointment with my therapist but that’s weeks away. 

He lied about a lot of serious things to get me to have sex with him. Then when I found out and screamed and stopped, he threatened to post pics he had of me(I was 16 and he was 18) to my parents and friends. I lost all of my friends and went back to my abusive ex who resumed abusing me until I finally stood up for myself and left after he did the same thing and took advantage of me while I was unprotected. He set off this nightmare that I fell into. 

I feel like he deserves the karma of whatever shit fire his life is now. My forgiveness will do nothing for that. Besides I don’t hold him accountable, I reported him back when it happened and past that he has destroyed his own life.

b0v0br,Does your family believe you or is it just mine?,"I have very vivid memories of my past. From sexual abuse at age 7 from a cousin to living as the care taker and protector in my family while dealing with my fathers terrible alcoholism, emotional and verbal abuse. There are so many other things I remember also.
    And when I say remember, I mean a perfect picture memory sometimes all the way down to what everyone is wearing or where we were driving in the car, or even what holiday it was close to. 
     I have been trying to heal a lot recently and am in DBT therapy and love it, but I am very emotional normally and this therapy has made me even more emotional. I called my mom yesterday (which I should put out there I have a terrible relationship with bc she is not a mom, she has unfortunately become a narcissist and has mental health issues that have never been addressed correctly, OH and you can add alcoholism to her also) as I was talking about things in my childhood she started to scream and yell at me telling me I make up my own reality and that I manipulate people to make me look like the victim.  and I’d like to state I am not a victim of anything I have gone through I am the opposite, I’m a survivor and resilient. Anyways, I believe this has a lot to do with somethings from my past that I’ve spoken out about and she denies bc, honestly who wants to believe their 7 yr old daughter was sexually abused under their nose by their cousin? But she started throwing things at me and now has me questioning my entire way of thinking and all my memories good and bad. She told me that my therapist was ignorant for not being able to see that I have been manipulating her and I should probably find a new one.... this is the same women that pulled me from a therapist when I was in high school bc the therapist told her that she need to listen to me more bc I was not an angry child, just a hurt and afraid child and that my mom need to take responsibility for some of it.

b0v75g,"First time posting, does ur family believe yr PTSD?","I tried to post this a minute ago but don’t know if it worked.... 

    I have dealt with PTSD for years now. And I have a picture memory for the most part, and remember everything. It can be a good thing but for my PTSD it is terrible.... I can remember what people were wearing, where we were driving in the car, what season it was, even if there was a holiday near the time the memory happened... it’s creepy.

  I am in DBT therapy and I love it. I don’t have the best relationship with my mom, she was a good mom for my early years and then basically left my little sister and I to fend for ourselves so she could become codependent on my fathers alcoholism. I took on the role of care taker and protector for both my parents and my sister, while my brother were in the army and in Iraq. So to say I respect her as a mother is far from it, but as a woman yes I do.

  I called her yesterday bc I was said, father was killed about 13 years ago and his birthday would be tomorrow and normally it doesn’t bother me but this year it is. So I called her to just say hi and hear her voice. We started to talk about some childhood things, and as I started to talk she started to curse and yell at me saying that I am delusional and I make up my own reality to manipulate people into thinking I’m a victim.. which is not true bc I am NOT a victim I am a survivor and a resilient, strong woman. She was calling me names and hanging up on me and brought me to a hysterical crying spell. She told me that I needed to get my brain checked bc I have no sense of what my life was and I make it up as I go along.... I should add that my mom is now an alcoholic and has had mental health issues that were never properly addressed, so she herself is sick. She even went as far as saying she doesn’t care what happen to me when I was 7, ( my cousin sexually abused me in multiple occasions) and that it doesn’t matter how I feel about any of it. I could go on and on and on but it just gets worse.... 
  This conversation left me in a black hole, I am now second guessing myself on everything, do I even know who I am? Am I making things up? Is she projecting on me? Is this her way of denying things bc SHE can’t accept reality and has to make up HER own reality? 
     She even went as far as saying I need a new therapist bc mine is dumb if she couldn’t see how I’ve manipulated her by telling her these lies and fairy tales... but my mom is also the the woman that took me from my therapist in high school bc my therapist said I wasn’t an angry child, I was hurt and afraid and that my mom need to listen to me and take some responsibility for how I felt.... 
    Before this I never questioned myself, but now, I feel like I don’t even know who I am anymore. And it caused me a huge depression relapse and I got impulsive and spent money I don’t have today and stayed in bed for hours sleeping/crying/internet shopping... I just want her to love me and believe me bc my nightmares and terrors can’t just be things I make up, can they?",tumblina2288,2019-03-13 20:03:33,5,620,11.53,29.72,76.44,8.46,21.38,11.77,94.52,63.55,24.35,17.58,13.06,0.48,0.16,3.71,0.16,6.77,4.19,11.45,10.48,4.84,11.13,2.58,20.81,4.35,2.1,1.94,0.65,1.29,5,1.77,3.23,0.32,1.13,0.65,12.26,2.26,0,5.32,0.65,11.29,2.74,2.9,2.1,1.45,0.81,2.42,3.06,0.48,1.77,0.65,2.42,0.48,1.45,0.16,0.32,7.74,2.26,0.81,3.06,1.61,0.32,7.1,13.55,0.32,12.9,1.29,6.13,5.48,0.48,0.97,0.32,0.48,0,0.16,1.61,0.16,1.29,0.16,0,0,14.19,7.26,3.06,0,0,0.97,0,0,0,2.26,0.32,0.32
b0vlqi,Could sudden severe anxiety cause PTSD?,"Hi, at the start of the year I woke up with some messed up symptoms. My head would feel completely numb in the mornings, intense coldness down the top of my head, and it would be hard to read. I also had severe DP/DR to the point where my head felt fried. I constantly had to touch my body to feel connected. I was in a panic state 24/7 I guess? Very on edge. I didn't have panic attack though. Weird head sensations, skin around nails were peeling, I was pale. I made a few ER trips, had the same arrogant Doctor both times. He basically said nothing was wrong with me. I was fucked up, how was nothing wrong with me? Eventually everything mellowed out a bit for 2 months. It all came back so much stronger. I was in a panic state for 4 days until I went to the ER and they gave me some benzos. I was in a panic state for 2 months straight. The rebound anxiety between doses was awful. I didn't want to be alone. My jaw was constantly in pain, my ears were ringing, ear pain, I had really bad floaters, and flashing lights when looking at bright things, sensory overload etc. I had so much tension and agitation I thought I was developing schizophrenia or going into psychosis. Thoughts of never gonna be able to come back from this and my life was pretty much done. I know most of you will say that this isn't traumatic, but believe me it is/was. The worse months in my life.

b0vyaa,Parents with PTSD and how it effects their children.,"Hi there! This is my first time on reddit, so this post might be all over the place.

I am currently 17 years old, and I've had a father who was in the Marines and the US Army. He was forced to retire because of a serious head injury. He was a sergeant. And was stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

My father is a complicated man. I do not know what happened to him while he was doing his services, but he has very intense PTSD. almost a year ago (Last Fall) He was arrested. Charged with public intoxication and misuse of a firearm. I do not know the situation well, because my mom refused to tell me the details.  Since then, I have lost contact with him. A few months ago he went to a rehab center for his drug use (presumably to cope with his PTSD). He deleted all of his social media, kept on moving from state to state within weeks. 

I love my dad, but he was the main reason I have MY ptsd. He did a lot of things, but one I remember was when my little sister and I were in the airport to meet with him. When he picked us up, we went to those little trains(To travel throughout the airport) and my little sister didn't get on the train on time. I know my dad better than my sister and his girlfriend at the time. I knew he was triggered, he was shaking and his face turned red. I remember feeling terrified (know this was our first time seeing him in YEARS), and I knew he was extremely stressed and anxious.

When we retrieved my sister, my dad was silent. He didn't say anything when we got her, he just walked, almost sprinting to the parking lot. I remember my head pounding, I was expecting the worse. And the worse did come. When we all got into the car, there was a stinging silence that made my body cold. Then, my dad, turned from his seat and started screaming at us. SCREAMING. I call it his warvoice, the one he used when he was mad and probably used while he was overseas. I am terrified at the warvoice. It carries the volume of rage and fear. He started with my sister. He began to say things like *You are too disobedient and careless! From now on you RESPECT me and do whatever I say!* I was bawling at this point. this was when I was about 13/14. Surprisingly my sister was not affected at all. But after he was done with her,  he turned to me. I will never forget what he said to me.

&amp;#x200B;

*And you-- you are failing school! You are supposed to be smart! You are a (Last Name)! Act like it!*

&amp;#x200B;

Look, I love my dad. Because he is my dad and made sacrifices that no normal person could. But... the reason why I was failing school at that time because I was extremely depressed and didn't even take care of myself. So it hurt when he said that, I knew that I disappointed him. It is clear that I was his favorite child, because he and I are a lot alike. I almost understood him, and feared that I would never have a temper like he did. After all that fiasco we went to his house and  everything turned to normal. Seemingly. But I was extremely effected. That whole week was hell to me. I never forgot it. 

Last Summer, I went to therapy. Other things have happened to me in my life, but my relationship with my dad has impacted me the most. I wanted to share this because my PTSD hasn't effected me as much as it used to. And that children of veterans are real. 

Thank you.",grabbyflabby,2019-03-13 21:25:07,3,658,18.04,67.03,49.82,5.92,11.34,13.37,92.71,61.7,24.62,19.3,9.88,1.37,1.06,6.84,0.15,5.32,4.86,10.79,10.03,4.71,8.36,1.67,19.15,3.5,1.98,2.13,1.06,1.82,5.17,1.67,3.5,1.06,0.61,0.91,16.11,2.58,0.3,1.37,8.05,12.61,3.04,3.65,0.61,1.82,1.98,2.43,2.43,0.61,1.37,0.46,1.82,0.76,0.91,0,0,6.99,3.65,0.91,1.82,0.76,0.61,11.55,7.45,0.76,13.07,2.43,3.95,6.53,0.91,0.3,0.15,0,0.3,0,0.46,0.15,0.15,0,0.15,0,17.93,8.36,3.95,0,0.61,0,1.06,0.3,0,0.76,1.52,1.37
b0wwgh,Triggering Song,"(To be clear, I'm not talking about a song coming up on the radio or in public, I feel that's it's own separate sucky thing.)

So in times of stress or when I'm feeling very scared, a song from my past plays in my head. It's a very easy to recall jingle/beat, so my mind blares it and I feel very quickly triggered into panic.

I try to do guided imagery, guided meditation, and listen to happy upbeat music or light hearted comedy to distract myself.

Does this happen to anyone else? What do you do?

My major trauma happened to be when I was sleeping/waking up twice I have woke up in the middle of a traumatic experience. 
My body puts me straight into fight or flight when I get up and I'm away easily enraged. 
It's breaking my heart cause I'm being horrible to my loved ones and they don't deserve it. 
I am on mirtrazapine and quetiapine at night and beta blockers during the day which have helped me fall and stay asleep. However I am still very reactive in the morning and it's horrible. I am being horrible. 
I used to be a morning person now I am angry and horrible to be around. 
I feel like I've had a piece of me ripped away and I don't know how to stop all this anger. 
Is there something I should be doing in the morning that can help this?

b11tef,ptsd / inability to think about or discuss a future,"hi.  i’ve had ptsd for 12 years after a life threatening medical issue. for probably 3 years after the issue i was in a near constant panic attack state where every single day i thought was going to be my last and was hospitalized probably once a month because of it. among various other issues this has caused for me, one of the worst is that i have never been able to think about, discuss or allow myself to look forward to a future of any kind. i kind of just live every day thinking ‘ok now i have one more day’ and while i am now able to plan things a few weeks or max a few months in advance, i still get incredibly stressed, upset and shut down completely when faced with committing to anything farther out because still, 12 years later, i think i am going to be gone.  i spend nearly all my time working to save money for my kids in case something terrible happens to me (my dad died when i was very young, and i saw how my mom struggled).  it is somehow more terrifying to me to think about a future that i don’t really believe i can have than not thinking about it at all. for obvious reasons this is impacting my relationships and my career because of my inability to allow myself to want or consider that i have a future. i’ve been to countless therapists over the years and on multiple different antidepressant/anti-anxiety medications. nothing seems to help; this is clearly a very deep rooted issue for me. i’m not sure any of this makes sense but i guess i am wondering if anyone can relate to this or has any tips.",agitatedlending,2019-03-14 08:41:26,5,303,46.68,8.29,99,5.05,25.25,16.17,93.4,57.1,16.5,11.22,11.22,0,0,0,0,5.28,4.29,15.18,9.24,7.59,6.6,1.65,17.49,6.27,3.3,1.32,2.31,4.62,4.62,1.32,3.3,2.31,0.66,0,3.3,0.66,0,0.33,0.33,19.8,4.62,3.3,0.66,6.6,3.63,4.29,0.99,0.66,0,0,2.31,0,2.31,0,0,5.61,0.99,1.65,2.64,0.66,0.66,3.3,12.87,2.31,16.17,1.65,4.95,10.23,0.66,0,0,0.66,0,0.33,0.33,0,0,0.33,0,0,9.9,3.63,2.31,0,0.33,0,0,0.33,0.33,1.65,0.66,0.66
b12gav,Had a 3.5 hour flashback/panic attack last night,"I’ve had panic attacks that bad and that long before, but never a flashback.

It was when my partner told me I had to leave for the night that I first started panicking—the thought of taking an Über home was scary. My mother’s boyfriend (I live with both of them) has been going through a lot lately and has been a bit violent. It’s hard for me to be home because I don’t want to encounter him and for him to take his anger out on me. Then I dissociated, then I started crying, then I started screaming and kicking. I was huddled in a corner asking my partner if he was going to hurt me, and pleading with him not to even when he said he wouldn’t. A pillow touched me and I freaked out even more. When I started to calm down he was able to help me stand up, but I kept almost falling because I thought my legs were tied together.

I managed to wake my mom up by calling her and begging her to pick me up. On the way home she told me to quit exaggerating. When she gave me some prescribed Ativan she stood too close to me for my comfort zone, I started screaming and crying again, and she called me pathetic for asking her to back up. My mother who’s supported me through everything my whole life is finally sick of me.

I appreciate my partner. I wonder if he’ll feel comfortable ever talking to me again. I apologized a million times last night but he just changed the subject or lied and said it was okay. I can’t imagine anyone would want to be around me when stuff like this happens. I’m very embarrassed. I’m not sure what to do today except for stay in bed.

I just wonder if flashbacks lasting for so long is normal.

b15jiz,Mothers last words,"I told my mother on her death bed “I love you mommy” her last words to me was “no you don’t”.  I was 15 years old.   I’m now an adult with ptsd from childhood abuse. My mother never once in her life told me she loves me and physically and verbally abused me but not my siblings. Before she died she made arrangements for my two younger siblings to live with family but not myself. My name wasn’t even mentioned in any of the documents. It was like I didn’t exist. I was tossed around from house to house until I saved up enough to move out on my own at 18. 

I recently ran into some family and was triggered. My anxiety is off the charts and nightmares of my mother every time I try to sleep. 

I need peace in my life.

b15tz5,My journey with PTSD thus far...,"1) My Childhood - From the outside my childhood may have looked idyllic. An affluent family and born-again Evangelical Christian parents who ministered to local children.

However, behind closed doors I spent my entire childhood terrified of my mother and father.

When I think of my father I think of the time he pushed my brother and I as hard as he could on the chest because we were disturbing a phone call by running in the house. I went airborne and smashed the back of my head against the tile floor. I remember squirming like an overturned bug as I experienced the greatest pain I've ever known.

When I think of my mother I think of her pulling my hair and yelling in my face. I think of the constant disapproval of nearly everything I ever did.

Looking back, I'm not even sure what they wanted from me. Maybe if I had been a perfect child, like my sister, who never got in trouble and never had an independent thought, perhaps I would have been spared some of the abuse.

Going through every bit of trauma I experienced isn't really my purpose here. Suffice to say that despite growing up in an affluent family I don't have a single happy childhood memory.

2) My Brother's Suicide - It became apparent to me that my brother was seriously mentally ill when he decided to go off his medication. His wife had left him due to his alcoholism, among other issues, and he decided that was a good time to quit his job and stop taking his meds.

Over the course of 3 months I was constantly in a panic as I attempted to make sense of what was going on and get my brother help. I have a lot of regrets about this time in my life. Mostly I wish I had listened more instead of trying to tell him what to do.

After being off his medicine for 3 months he called my mother to tell her he was ""going west."" He made it as far as Indiana before smashing his car in to a bridge abutment. He was killed instantly and his car was engulfed in flames. To make matters worse the local news covered the accident so now when you google his name the flaming wreckage of his vehicle is one of the first results.

While my parents do not accept that it was a suicide, having examined the crash site there is no doubt in my mind the crash was intentional. Fortunately no one else was harmed.

3) The Asylum - Recently I felt the pressures of life mounting up on me and decided to spend time in a mental institution. While I would give the place I stayed at very low marks as far as care I don't regret my decision.

While in the asylum I was diagnosed with PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, and addiction issues with alcohol and marijuana. I was prescribed a lot of medication and I learned new coping and grounding techniques that I've put in to use since being released. I also had a chance to meet new people, some of which I've kept in contact with. I spent 12 days in the asylum in all.

4) Confronting My Parents - It became almost immediately apparent to me that I needed to confront my parents about the damage that they had done to me.

I went to their home, explained that I had been diagnosed with PTSD because of the way they treated me. I also said I didn't want apologies, I wanted compensation in the form of $50K from both of them. As you might imagine this did not go over well.

I believe my mother may have been willing to apologize but my father was so busy talking over everyone I couldn't say for sure. He said I was ""traumatizing"" them with my confrontation. I went full manic calling them hypocrites, child abusers, fake Christians, etc. I even said ""fuck you"" to both my parents for the first time ever.

My final words as I left their home was ""You killed my brother and you killed my brother. Both of you burn in hell for what you did."" I have not spoken to my parents since and they have made no attempt to contact me. I did feel very good after leaving their home but of course I am in no way cured.

5) The Future - I have to admit I am at a point of despair. I find it impossible to believe that I'll ever be capable of feeling happiness. I find it impossible to believe that I'll ever be a stable contributing member of society.

It feels like the only emotions I'm capable of are anxiety, anger, and sadness. It seems that I can only hope to be temporarily relieved of those emotions.

Will I ever feel happiness?
If I have a child, will I love them or will I feel nothing?
Where will I work next? Will I ever find a job that I enjoy? Am I capable of enjoying anything?

These questions haunt me. I'm not suicidal now but I have been for 14 years. Now I only wish I'd never been born. Why did my parents even have me when they so clearly hate children?

I literally have everything I want and I'm still miserable. I have a good wife, a home, and money. Yet I wake up every morning feeling depressed and spend all day being anxious. Why even bother if this is what life will always be for me?

Yes, I have a psychiatrist.
Yes, I am seeking out patient counseling.
Yes, I am seeking out support groups.

The problem is I don't think any of this is going to change anything.

b1799h,Ptsd triggered by guy at work,"I am a 28 y/o female and I work with kids in an office environment. Most of my coworkers are female, which I like because I feel more comfortable working with women, and I have had traumatic experiences with male coworkers in the past. 

One of my coworkers is a male in his mid-50s and ever since I started working there I've gotten a bad vibe from him. About a month ago, I had a dream where he assaulted a kid we work with. Since then, he has cornered me twice and spoken to me in a hostile and confrontational manner. 

Today, he motioned me into an empty room, closed the door, and stood about 6 inches from my face. He asked if I had done a particular thing, to which I replied yes. He then told me not to do the thing any more. I honestly can't describe it in more detail because thinking about it is triggering me. But it was hostile and confrontational. My workplace is supposed to be ""magical"" because we work with kids. 

The interaction sounds normal, but I experienced it as a verbal assault. To me that's how it felt. This guy and I have the same position, so it's not like he is my superior and has the authority to tell me what to do. I felt all of his hostile energy and I feel bad vibes any time this guy and I are in close proximity to each other. 

What should I do to protect myself against this guy's hostile energy that causes my ptsd to be triggered? My gut says quit, die, etc, because people like this have fucked with me in the past. But I like this job and I don't want to quit, and obviously I don't want to die.

b17doo,The Cabin,"Every year there is a large snowboard event, last year was my first full weekend ever in a cabin. I have anxity prior. A buddy of mine warned me that this dude is going to short fuse and go after whoever is in his bath.. so im on edge day 1

Day 2 was time for a good winter party. The guy who was going to blow at any minute was ticking away until he was gone for a couple hours. He had passed out in the car and our dd was driving him to the cabin. 

An hour or so went by so we found a ride back to see if the coast is clear.. it wasn't.

I looked directly into the eyes of something not human, so i ran away. Far as i could to get away from him. 

We end up safe for the moment. 4am rolls around and we want to go to bed. Back to the cabin we go. By this time the guy is passed out but we could hear him waking up. So we acted asleep.

I was in a full panic attack trying to sleep. Every sound in that cabin woke me up that night. 

Weekend was over and i got home. The first night back i was having night terrors. Wasnt sleeping, i would look out the window to see if he was outside at 3am.

It was reacurring for months the souless monster inside him, in my head. I spoke with him about it, but he kind of blew it off. 

November comes im ready to ride, pay for a season pass i saved for. First day riding, he comes all the thoughts back to me..

Snowboarding is my life i ride 50-60 times a year. This season once. 

I needed to fix it. So i told him again what happened and whats wrong. They were so hammered they dont remember any of it, and think im lying about it.

Its destroying my day to day life, im in a constant panick attack.

Im going to a therapist soon.

Several months ago I woke up every day and I wanted to die. All day I would have flashbacks and phantom pain. I cried every day for months. When my parents were not home I would sneak into the woods so I could call the suicide hotline. Nobody knew I had depression then, nobody realized I had PTSD.

That is how I was after things happened.

When I turned 19 that’s when I started to make the effort and see her more, I was still annoyed but I loved her so much. I was trying to mend whatever relationship I could with her, I even put myself in therapy for it. I remember 2 weeks before she died I deleted a bunch of her voicemails and not even thinking. She left me at least 4 voicemails a day. She died unexpectedly. I fortunately was able to save one of the last voicemails she sent me tho. I’m grateful. A whole year passes and I got SO close to my dad, I’ve never been so close to him in my life and I forgave him for everything. Losing my mom taught me forgiveness. I’m glad I learned that lesson early, I lost him a year later. Spent the night in the hospital for months. His death was long and very exhausting. Skip forward to a few years later and I have all this unresolved trauma from my childhood come up on top of the unresolved trauma from losing them, completely taking over my life. It’s so conflicting because I love my parents so much and I want to remember them in a loving way and I do for the most part, but there are days where memories from my childhood takes over and it’s hard to escape from it. I say the most horrible, nasty regretful things about them and I feel so bad about it when I’m feeling better. It’s so conflicting and I hate it so much. Its just so back and fourth. I love and I miss them so much, I just wish my childhood was at least a little normal so I can grieve in a healthy way.😞",BOOberry94,2019-03-14 21:07:32,0,423,11.42,24.64,91.7,1.08,17.62,14.66,96.93,59.81,23.17,19.15,13.95,0.24,0,4.02,0.95,4.02,4.49,11.11,7.57,10.17,11.58,0.95,17.26,5.44,2.6,1.89,1.18,3.78,8.98,2.84,6.15,0.47,2.13,2.13,10.17,1.65,0,3.78,1.18,12.06,3.55,1.65,1.18,1.89,1.42,2.36,3.07,0.24,0.95,1.89,2.13,0,1.42,0,0,8.51,2.36,2.36,2.36,0.95,1.42,6.86,7.33,0.24,14.66,2.13,6.86,6.86,1.18,0,0.24,0.24,0,0.95,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,0,12.29,5.91,3.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.84,0,0.24
b1ac8p,Dealing with the death of a loved one TW:Suicide,"So a little context. Ive known my husband since I was a small child, my mother was best friends with his mother and since he is two years older than me he would babysit my little brother and I to make sure we didnt murder each other. His grandma has always been my grandma ever since I can remember it was always Christmas at my mother's and then Christmas at my husband's grandma's house. She is 91 years old and dying right now. 


I grew up in a small family never dealing with personal loss until my mom committed suicide to punish me when I was 23. My relationship with my mother was abusive and since she used suicide as a punishment it was such a different grieving process, it was a wide range of emotions from relief, sadness, guilt to hatred and anger. But now I see this kind woman, who has always been there for me, and she cant speak and she is in pain and everything seems so much more final now. I think because of how sudden my mother's death was Ive always had this feeling that I will turn around and she will be standing there and this will have all been a terrible dream but seeing and knowing someone will die, its like waiting for the other shoe to drop. 


The emotions are unbelievably uncomfortable, I dont like showing emotion in the first place and I don't like seeing others in pain. I am diagnosed with PTSD and a panic disorder and when it comes to painful emotions I go into ""protect me"" mode and completely shut down and its pretty much screw everyone else. Im just worried I wont be able to support my family. Death is messy and it hurts, it's uncomfortable and that sucks. I want so badly to be numb right now but this is life, I cant stay stuck. So I will try to feel the grief and pain to their capacity and I will allow myself to mourn a beautiful person. 


My grandma wants to pass away, she is tired and ready to rest so even though this sounds odd please pray she gets her wish, that she sleeps soundly and pain free tonight and gently slips away in her dreams.",Ones_Fate,2019-03-14 21:18:48,0,393,20.84,35.12,75.76,1,24.56,14.76,95.67,57.51,19.34,13.49,9.41,0.25,0,3.56,0.25,5.85,3.82,11.45,10.69,5.6,10.18,1.78,18.58,4.83,2.04,1.02,1.27,1.27,11.45,3.31,6.87,1.27,2.04,1.53,10.94,3.82,0.25,5.34,1.78,12.72,2.04,2.29,1.27,1.02,3.05,3.31,4.07,1.27,0.76,2.04,3.05,0.51,2.04,0.25,0,6.11,2.29,1.27,2.29,0.51,0.51,4.58,11.7,3.05,15.27,1.78,6.36,7.38,0,1.02,0.76,0.25,0.76,3.05,0.51,0.51,0,0,0,0,9.41,3.82,3.05,0.25,0,0,0,0,0.51,1.78,0,0

I keep getting these images in my head, and it feels very similar to when you're trying to remember a dream you've had. The images are accompanied by a really disgusting feeling, and sometimes sensation of touching this disgusting thing. Is this what flashbacks are like?

The twist however, is that the images I'm getting are really specific and weird (in lack of a better word) I can't think of any sort of situation in real life where they would belong, traumatic or not. So are they still flashbacks if they are fictional?

b1b00t,[Rant] To whoever says I have to keep trying during this bs PTSD journey..,"I’ll have you know that it’s exhausting trying to stay afloat when all I have is arm floaties and the ocean has huge waves crashing over me one after another. Even those of you (generalization, not speaking about anyone in this sub in particular) with ptsd that say this shit to people like me that just don’t want to fight for once, stfu. Everyone’s journey is different, even people with the exact same trauma stemming from the exact same thing at the same time. People are different and react differently. People cope differently and I’m just so sick and tired of hearing from well wishers that everything will be okay so long as I don’t give up. Like hold on here, are you trying to tell me how to recover? I’m sorry, are you me? Are you inside my mind? Are you with me in my darkest hour(s)? Let’s be real here, are you even aware of what’s really going on with me rn or are you sure that I’m even telling you what’s *really* going on? Instead of brushing you away because I’m sick of well wishing comments like “don’t stop trying and I’ll be by your side. If you stop trying, I’ll love you from a distance.” Or “you’re acting like you were [at an event that is unrelated to my trauma but triggered the shit out of me anyways] and always make yourself into a victim.” Or “When [similar trauma] happened to me as a kid, my mom wouldn’t let me lose my shit, you shouldn’t let it get to you this bad.” Heyy 🖕🏼 

Since I was 12 years old, almost 20 years ago, I’ve been battling mental health and literally for my life with suicide attempts and ideations. Ptsd is unlike anything I’ve experienced and even though people may have similar experiences or even have some form of ptsd themselves, doesn’t mean they get to dictate how I heal. If I want to not progress, if I want to not practice personal hygiene, if I want to do my damnest to destroy my body, even if it’s not the wisest choice, that’s my choice and not anyone else’s. I know damn well how my “My life is falling apart” journey goes, it’s happened several times over 18 years, it’s basically the same way with a few variations. Trust in the system. Let me have my temper tantrum, and I’ll eventually come out of whatever I’m going through. If people can’t handle the system, honestly at this point with so few people left, they can leave. I’d rather be alone than surrounded by well wishers that say well meaning things that come out as really fucked up. Or people that hold beliefs that are so ass backwards. Or people that forget it even happened and say things like “Why did you have to pick [her birthday month which also has the trauma anniversary] of all months?!” Well to be fair, if it was my choice, it wouldn’t have happened at all, but you’re right, it should’ve been a different month because how dare it inconvenience you and your plans.",BadJuJuForYou,2019-03-14 22:36:21,10,537,15.12,34.78,80.09,6.85,20.65,14.53,93.11,61.45,21.04,13.22,8.19,0.19,4.1,0.19,0.56,7.82,2.98,14.15,13.04,7.64,8.38,2.42,21.04,5.21,4.1,2.23,0.93,1.49,7.08,2.61,4.28,0,2.05,0.56,10.61,0.19,0,0.37,0,16.2,2.05,2.23,3.17,4.47,1.68,6.52,1.86,0.19,1.12,0.19,2.98,1.12,1.49,0.19,0,5.4,0.37,1.86,1.86,0.56,0.93,2.61,14.9,2.23,12.66,2.42,6.15,4.47,0.19,0,0,0,0.19,0.19,3.35,1.68,0.56,0.19,1.12,0.19,20.48,3.91,4.66,0,0,1.12,0.19,0,1.86,6.15,0.74,1.86
b1b86g,Betrayal Bonds &amp; How to make lasting connections,"I’m a 26 y/o women and was only recently diagnosed with ptsd from child abuse, neglect, and bipolar. 
I didn’t realize until I started seeing a therapist that the relationships I’ve entered into are all toxic in some way. I get really attached to people that don’t care about me.
Example:
I’ve recently been seeing a man that only wants to hang out after 2am. He had initiated an actual date with me and didn’t show up saying he left his cell phone at home, and he’s terrible with time. 
I feel so compelled to believe this kind of behavior because I just want to be loved not unlike my relationship with my parents. I just want affection and attention, but because of my childhood I feel that I have to try waaay too hard to make anyone want to be around me (friends included) and this behavior comes out naturally. I feel like I can’t control it. 

Needless to say, I am very lonely.
I don’t know how to stop this cycle, I feel helpless.

b1blib,Really having a rough time lately.,"This year has just been constant stress so far. I knew that it would be, it's my last term in school, until the past couple weeks there were ongoing housing issues, I got pretty sick unexpectedly, etc. But I mostly had things under control -- it was a lot of stress but I knew there was an end in sight. Then one more thing happened and everything fell apart. It hit all my triggers and I've just been a wreck. I can't eat, can't sleep, can't stop crying for more than a short period. I know everything will be okay and that things won't feel this way for long, but right now it does and I don't know what to do.

b1d5xh,Tips on how to stop vivid flashbacks and panic attacks without medications?,"I’m not seeing the psychiatrist my doctor referred me to until late May. I can’t afford to see another psychiatrist ASAP, so I’m dealing with this on my own. I am currently taking 10 mg Doxepin, and have previously taken Zoloft, but none of the medications are working. My doctor said he can’t prescribe me any other medications because it takes months for the Doxepin to leave my system. It apparently doesn’t mix well with most medications. He said that he wants me to wait until I see my psychiatrist for new medication. Right now, I’m tapering off of the Doxepin.

The Incident: (sorry for the long description) 

I used to work in a furniture store. Anyone who has worked in customer service understands that this industry sucks. I was extremely lucky, however, because I found a store that I actually enjoyed working in. This was mostly because of my amazing co-workers and managers. The majority of the customers were kind, and I don't know, I just enjoyed working there... until I encountered this one customer who I will refer to as Mary from now on.

Like a lot of our customers, Mary is a middle-aged white woman. She was waiting in line and was the only person waiting. My co-worker was helping someone at her till, and I was taking a quick ten-second break because I was feeling ill that day. I quickly noticed that Mary was getting agitated and giving me dirty looks, so I figured she was in a hurry. I opened my till and called her over to help. Here is how the interaction went:

Me: Hi, I can help you over here.

Mary: *walks over to the till* You don’t look like you want to help me.

Me: *slightly taken aback and confused* Oh, I’m not feeling well. I’m sick.

Mary: *getting aggressive* You don’t look like you want to help me. You don’t look like you want to be here. You’re daydreaming. I hope they send you home!

Me: *shocked and speechless* ... *continues scanning her stuff*

I honestly didn’t know what to say to that. I was sooo overwhelmed because she accused me of a bunch of things and was so aggressive. 

Mary: *even more aggressive* You don’t look like you want to help me. You don’t look like you want to be here. You’re daydreaming. I hope they send you home!

Me: *still shocked* ... *scanning her stuff in silence.*

Mary: *even MORE aggressive AND now pointing her finger in my face* You don’t look like you want to help me! You don’t look like you want to be here! You’re daydreaming! I hope they send you home!

Me: *managing to scramble enough words* Well, actually, they won’t send me home. My co-worker is going home soon, and I’m the only one here to close.

Of course, that made her even angrier.

Mary: *even MORE aggressive AND repeatedly pointing her finger in my face* You don’t look like you want to help me! You don’t look like you want to be here! You’re daydreaming! I hope they send you home! You don’t look like you want to help me! You don’t look like you want to be here! You’re daydreaming! I hope they send you home! I hope they send you home! I hope they send you home! I hope they send you home.

Me: *quietly scanning her stuff* ... The only time I uttered another word to her was when I told her the total. She kept screaming at me throughout the entire interaction.

Mary: *Starts leaving, but then turns around and points at me* I hope they send you home!

I honestly didn't know how to react to that. I was genuinely in shock and a bit shaken by the entire interaction. By the end of my shift, I've managed to forget about her. After two weeks, however, I randomly started having vivid flashbacks of the incident. Repeatedly reliving the incident caused my anxiety at work to skyrocket. I was terrified of returning to work. I started having flashbacks every single day. I became depressed. Eventually, I started drinking and smoking to suppress the flashbacks. To this day, I am still experiencing these flashbacks and panic attacks.

Initially, I didn't report this or talked to anyone about it, because I thought I was overreacting. I was also embarrassed because I couldn't defend myself. I just froze up as she hurled abuse at me and I took it like an idiot. What made it worse was that there were people there who witnessed how distressed I was and didn't even bother to tell her to chill or something. I truly regret not kicking her out or calling for a manager, but because I wasn't in the right mental state to deal with that stress, I struggled to process everything that was happening at the moment.

I quit my job in May if that year (2018), and haven’t worked ever since. I’m not in school either. I just stay at home wasting my life away. In July, I visited my family doctor, and she prescribed some medications to help. It has done nothing for me. I still experience these flashbacks and panic attacks. Therapy didn't help either. I don't know what to do. A part of me is terrified of working in a customer service environment (or simply leaving the house) again, but that's all I have experience in. I don’t know why this incident has affected me this much, and I just want to live a normal life again.

b1dqhq,"I was sexually and mentally abused my childhood, told I was a troll and would be treated as such, I sometimes do really well but sometimes I just need someone to talk to","It all started when I was seven years old, I’m 23 years old now. My brother was just born, I’m the first born child. It never really seemed like I was ever wanted. I’m transgender and when I was Born my mom didn’t want me because I was born a boy. Now I’ve transitioned into a girl and am definitely more comfortable with how I look and feel. It didn’t have anything to with that abuse, I was raised as a normal boy, but I was always happier as a girl. One night my cousin came over, and me and her were the closest because our parents hung out constantly. We were playing and she had this really pretty princess costume. I had something along the lines of I wish I was a girl and could do the stuff I wanted. Long story short I somehow ended up wearing that dress and twirling around ever so happy. My cousin was so happy to have another girl to play with. Well until my parents came down and found me. That’s when the sexual abuse started. I was told if I wanted to be a girl I’d be treated like a girl. But he didn’t mean nicely,  if was terrible rapes, ever day for 12 years. I would cringe getting off the school bus knowing what was going to happen. I was always told how bad of a child I was and was thrown around a lot, my siblings were the ones they wanted. I was just a bother that never did anything right. My parents would always tell me how much they hated me. I was such a confused kid as is It was so hard to deal with. It was hell. And as my four siblings got older they were a part of doing it to me as well. And when I was “bad” aka wasn’t good at a test or something, I would have to go live under the porch because I was a bad ugly little troll and that’s where I belonged. I’m not that smart, I’m autistic but I never really got any help with school, so it wasn’t my fault. I ran to the police so many times but they never helped me. My family’s wealthy so they turned away. I left on my eighteenth birthday and my parents tried so hard to psychologically abuse me into staying but I left. No plan in sight I just wanted out. It was hell. And I’m glad I’m free of it, but it’s left me broken and with a lot of problems. I manage to hold a full time job as a department manager at a pet store. It’s not much but it’s a big accomplishment for me. Being autistic it’s hard me in social situations but all of these years I’m been obsessed with fish because they calm me. So it’s been really nice in that way. I use some of the money to give myself the childhood I never had. I like to buy all the toys and dolls and stuffed animals I never got to enjoy. I can’t really say I’m a mature adult because I’m not. I’m scared of most people but I manage to kind of keep to myself and a few select friends that check in on me and make sure I’m okay. It’s so hard though because I really wish I had a mom and dad. With alll my heart it’s all I’ve ever wanted. But ones that actually loved me. I always feel so empty and jealous when I see other people with parents and realizing no one will ever want me. I’m just the ugly troll I suppose. My ptsd and depression haven’t really been great, so I was looking for some form of support.

b1ervn,My psychiatrist is convinced I am traumatized but I don't remember anything.,"I am trying, really really trying. I read all the horrible abuse stories I could find. Tried to imagine these things happening to me, tried to find tastes and music I knew were around when I was a child. Came up with nothing.   

And I can't even come up with any plausible story how I could have gotten traumatized in any way. I got diagnosed with DID, for which the consensus seems to be that the trauma has to happen before the age of 6-9.    

I grew up in a middle sized village with a stay at home mom. She literally can't even kill a spider, no way she ever hurt me. The only time she was not with me was when she gave me to a daycare for one hour every week so she could do sports. The daycare of the sports center. I have since been to that sports place again and nothing came up. I went to a regular kindergarten and elementary school. There was never any hospital stay, no serious (or even semi-serious) illnesses or summer camp or anything. No war zone, no natural disasters, middle class upbringing. No older siblings, no uncles who babysat. Only very rarely was alone with the grandparents and never felt uncomfortable around them as an adult. I also can't imagine my father doing anything like that. He hit me exactly once when I was already 16 and I think he was more shocked than I was and it didn't really hurt.            

I have gone through everything I remember that happened before I was 9, every memory, every place in my mind I could find. 

The only idea I have so far is if someone would have literally hypnotized my mom to not realize she had handed me over to someone. That is pretty much conspiracy theory level. What is next? Trauma from a past life? Alien abduction? /s     

So what do I do? If I don't even know what traumatized me, remember nothing, never had a flashback... how can I process it then? Or is the diagnosis wrong after all? Both my psychiatrist and a DID/trauma specialist seem pretty sure of it. And to be honest, I really do think that I exist, which would mean the dx has to be correct. Running in circles.   

Sorry I know if I can't find trauma I don't belong here.",redandyellowchair,2019-03-15 06:10:53,12,412,18.04,7.28,94.92,1,12.48,14.81,92.48,60.68,17.96,12.38,10.19,0,0,1.94,0.24,5.58,5.1,10.68,11.65,7.77,6.8,5.34,20.87,5.1,2.43,2.67,1.46,2.67,6.07,0.97,5.1,0.49,0.73,0.97,5.83,1.46,0,1.94,1.21,19.9,5.83,0.73,2.18,5.34,3.88,4.85,1.21,0,0.24,0.73,1.46,0,1.21,0,0.24,4.37,0.49,0.97,1.94,0.49,0.49,8.25,11.17,0.24,14.08,2.18,5.83,6.55,1.21,1.21,0.24,0,0,0.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.29,7.04,3.4,0,0,1.46,0,0.49,0,1.94,0.49,0.49

Our policies state that only adults over the age of 18 listed by the parents can pick up from program. Students 4th grade and up can walk home. We cannot release any student to Uber Driver’s. Yesterday evening, a student was not picked up from program. I informed the parent who then told me that all she could do was send an Uber Driver to get her. I told her this was fine, but she also much be present as I cannot release her student alone to the driver. Mom flipped her lid and started verbally attacking me. I told her that if she did not get her daughter that my only other option was to call the local authorities, which only made her attitude worse stating that I am prejudice and that how dare I treat her like a criminal. She finally hung up after threatening to fight me my stating “Get my hair down” to someone else she was with. My supervisor was well aware of this whole situation. After being threatened I did call the police who then tried to mediate the situation, which of course, failed. My supervisor then called the mother where she continued her threats and stated she was coming to her her daughter. I then had to call the police again and was on the phone with dispatch when she arrived. I stayed on the line in case things escalated and you can’t never predict anyone’s behavior. The mom came in, said nothing and left. I’m lucky because nothing escalated yesterday but now I’m having bad anxiety and other PTSD symptoms.

So I was a democrat for a while because the democrats all talk about caring about victims- but then I found out hillary defended a child rapist with ye old ""she wanted it"" argument- as a victim who went through the court system as a child myself I was shocked and horrified by how my liberal friends rationalized what she did- everything from calling it ""fake news"" to suggesting it was justified because she had to do it for her job as if sacrificing a child victim is totally okay if it's for a job. Some even told me I'd internalized sexism. Right... 

Now we have this Epstein and both the Trump and Clinton families look linked but I still see people trying to bend it to make it look like the side they hate was super involved and the side they like wasn't. ::eye roll:: Nobody cares about... you know... the VICTIMS. Frankly I'm pretty convinced both were buggering kids. 

Let me just say- I have been dealing with conservatives and they have toyed with the right to white enclaves, talk about race and IQ and white genocide and all this- to the point where I dropped out. I'm pretty disgusted with both parties. 

So then this shooting happened today and I'm just enraged because I read his manifesto and it sounds just like this group I was with- simultaneously child drag queens doing strip teases and calling it ""LGBT rights"" are a thing- I dunno I'm kind of in a stump of horror and rage and I hate people mode... 

I'm just really wanting the world to turn off.

b1l097,I would be happier never interacting with people ever again. How do I combat this?,"Long story short, I was in an abusive relationship for years, and was very fragile/vulnerable before that happened in the first place.

Now I have zero desire to socialize. I only go out to get groceries at late hours. The rest of the time, I work. I play video games for fun, sometimes, but only light and/or stress-free ones.

But I can't keep doing this. I mean, I can.. but I shouldn't? It's not healthy? I guess what I mean is that in order to get better, I need to keep moving forward.

b1l6ar,I think I'm having a PTSD response,"Hello everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a combat veteran, or have been diagnosed with PTSD, but I feel like I'm having what sounds like a PTSD response. A few years ago I was stabbed multiple times breaking up a bar fight in which a friend's boyfriend was slapping her around and stabbed me several times while stopping him. For a while after that, anytime adrenaline would flood my body I'd automatically go into a fight or flight response, one time even slamming a 10 year old in a grocery store against some shelves after hearing him run up behind me. (I apologized profusely to the kid and his parent, who understood thankfully, but I felt and still feel awful about it)  


About two days ago I was walking to the store and a security guard was pretending to draw his gun on his security guard buddy behind me and I snapped. I almost took the guy out and realized what was happening before tackling him. I screamed at him about what an idiot his is and how all three of us almost got into a situation where none of us would walk away unharmed. 

&amp;#x200B;

That night I broke up with my girlfriend who launched into me about what an idiot I am for doing that, and I've been on the edge of rage or tears ever since. I can't think, I'm snapping at work, my heart is beating a hundred miles an hour all the time. I don't know what to do.   


I don't know if this is PTSD, I don't know what this is, but I feel like I'm losing my mind and anyone around me right now.  Does anyone have any experience with something like this? I'm not trying to claim that my trauma is the same as those who have experienced combat PTSD, and I certainly apologize if I'm coming off that way, I'm just kind of lost and scared right now.",miggitymcwilly,2019-03-15 15:32:57,14,333,36.37,20.87,96.42,2.3,25.62,14.71,90.39,60.36,21.62,14.41,11.11,0.6,0,2.7,0,7.21,6.61,13.81,10.81,4.8,6.91,2.1,18.02,2.4,2.7,3.6,1.5,2.4,5.11,1.2,3.9,0.3,1.5,1.2,8.71,0.3,1.2,0.3,3.3,14.41,3.9,1.8,1.2,4.5,1.5,3.6,3,0,0.9,1.2,1.5,0.6,0.3,0,0.6,7.81,2.1,1.2,2.4,0.6,1.8,4.8,11.41,0.3,17.12,2.1,7.51,7.51,0.3,0.3,0,0.6,0,0,0.6,0.6,0,0,0,0,15.32,3.3,4.2,0,1.2,0.3,0,0,0,4.5,0.6,1.2

b1lx5a,"TW, Survivors and activism","TW: sexual assault









So I was involved in sexual assault prevention activism before I remembered my assault, but after my memories came back, I really had to limit what I did bc it would trigger me so much. I really want I be involved though and volunteer. I had an interview today with an organization that I thought I could do outreach and education with, but they really need volunteers to answer the hotline and go with survivors to the hospital. I’m afraid of getting triggered by this, but I really want to give back and help others. Are there any other survivors who are involved in activism that can give some advice? How do you know if you’re ready for that and what do you do if you do get triggered badly? Also, I’m hoping that helping others will maybe reduce the helpless feeling I have, but idk if that will actually happen, so just looking to hear from others who are further ahead in this process than me.

b1n1or,i had a particularly rough day in therapy,"I work with a therapist who specializes in working with trauma. He’s a great dude and has really helped me with having been sexually abused as a child. Sometimes he has some methods where I’m not sure where we’re going, but end up being really profound. Today was a day like that. I usually cry in therapy, but today I CRIED. He had me walk through my nightmares and “finish” them. So, I always wake up from a nightmare right before the worst thing happens. So, he made me walk through the dream, add whatever was necessary to help me escape, and then escape. It was incredible. I felt really good about it. 

Here’s where the rough part comes in. As we were talking he said, “Why did you just let it (the sexual abuse) happen?” and without batting an eye, I gave an answer. He just stopped and said, “We need to get you to a point where you’re offended by me saying you let it happen. You did not let it happen. You were a child.” And we just kinda left that at that. It really hit me just how much guilt I’ve been carrying around for years and how I’ve been blaming myself instead of a man who was 11 years older than me. 

I don’t really know why I’m posting this. I was diagnosed with PTSD less than a month ago. I had never talked about sexual abuse in therapy. This is the first time I’ve opened up about it with a professional. I guess I’m pretty proud of myself for how far I’ve come. My therapist thinks I’m making a lot of progress. I don’t know. It was a difficult session, but I feel better. Wednesday, I was pretty sure I was going to kill myself.

b1onr6,Can anyone relate to this?,"Trigger warning (it's triggering to me so I don't know if it will be for others too)

A couple years ago my boyfriend and I decided to move states because he needed knee surgery (nothing too serious) and we were having financial problems. He ended up moving before me and I followed a few months later. He had the surgery while we were long distance in different states. Being apart from him  during such a hard time in our relationship and with him having surgery and recovering was really stressful for me. Now we are married  and doing well, but I keep having flashbacks to his surgery and panic attacks because my body is reliving it.  It sounds like the dumbest thing, but I can't even talk to him about his surgery because I have such bad anxiety surrounding it. He knows about this, and he knows to not talk about anything regarding surgery, hospitals, anesthesia, etc. I avoid all conversations, videos, etc about this topic because I can't stop thinking about that time two years ago and how helpless I was and I couldn't be there for him. I can't even handle him being sick or going to the dentist or even talking about these things because it brings up such bad memories for me. 

I have a history of depression, anxiety, and  OCD and now I think PTSD might be added to the mix. I have talked to a therapist in the past, and  I just started seeing a  new one so I'm going to bring this up in therapy. Does anyone else out there have a similar experience? I feel like this is such a minor thing to be so traumatic, but I just don't want to be alone and  I don't know what to do until I am able to work this out with a professional.

b1p09f,I feel like my own mind is working against me TRIGGER: ABUSE,"I’m just here to vent... this will probably get deleted but I don’t have anyone to talk to and I’m hoping this will help.

My mom was 17 when I was born. By the time I was 3 she was getting married to a man she had only been dating for 3 months before they got engaged. 

The man she married became my abuser. I remember being scared of him. One of my earliest memories is walking along the wall in hopes that he wouldn’t spank me. It got so much worse once my mother and stepfather had a kid together. 

She would do things wrong and I would get in trouble for them. Like the time that I took my friends to see the new born lambs at my birthday, and my sister came afterwards forgetting to shut the sliding door into the back of the barn which lead to the lambs, and the lambs got out. I remember him screaming at me for that. 

When I was 13 I was moved into the bottom room of the guest house. At the time I thought it was bliss because I was away from him. I now realize it was just another way for him to separate me from my family. 

He would constantly berate me and try to control my emotions. He would scream horrible insults and then mock me for crying. Examples being “everything I do, I do to make everyone else miserable.” Or that I was “an embarrassment to the family”.  

As I entered puberty he would make horrible remarks about my body and refer to me as a cheap hooker. 

He yelled at me when my paternal grandmother (the only connection I had to my bio dad’s family) passed away because I wasn’t “mourning properly”. 

There’s so many other examples that I could go on and on about. But basically he tore me down, did his best to separate me from the family, told me if I ever talked about him to anyone I was “in for a world of hurt”, gaslit me, tried his best to drive my maternal family away because they knew what was going on, for 15 years of my life. 

Throughout that time I’ve been in abusive relationship after abusive relationship with both men and women. I have no value in myself or confidence. 

Now, I’m in a good relationship and I feel safe. But now that I finally feel safe my brain is finally realizing what has happened all of these years. I’ve had a guard up and normalized horrible things for so long... and now that I’m realizing it, it’s like my own brain is working against me. 

I can’t sleep. I have horrible intrusive thoughts. I get panic attacks and nightmares, and I always feel the need to look over my shoulder. I can’t make it stop and it’s wearing me out. I wish I could make it all stop. My mind races constantly, doing mental gymnastics connecting things going on around me to things in my past. I see red flags where there are none. 

I’m scared and alone and I don’t know where to go to get help. I look online, I can’t afford an actual psychiatrist, I can’t talk about it without going into a panic attack. I don’t know what to do. I just want everything to stop but I don’t know how to make it stop. 

Sometimes I think I’m making it all up and that I’m just victimizing myself. Then I have to try and remember that’s how he wanted me to feel. But it just hurts so bad. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I don’t want to feel anything anymore.

b1pkbb,Picking up old hobbies,"Hi I’m new to the sub, never posted before. I’m 20 and after 3 years of struggling and wondering what’s wrong with me I finally went to therapy and was diagnosed this month. When my therapist did the evaluation and was asking me questions it was so surreal because it felt like she was inside my head and knew exactly what was going on. Especially with the nightmares for some reason I’d assumed had nothing to do with my mental health. 

Anyway, the real reason I’m posting is because I had such a hard day today I got the bright idea to go to the store and pick up some perler beads again. After 4 ish years of never touching them I just NEEDED something to work on and something I could make. So I got home and made a kitten only to discover my boyfriend and I have no iron 😂😂😂 so even though I laid in bed in the dark for the last few hours, disregarding everyone in the house: after the discovery my sweet boyfriend just left to the store to go get me one. 

So here’s some pictures of what I used to make, and the kitten I made today. I didn’t really know where to put this but I wanted to tell someone about it and this seemed like a good place given my situation right now. I hope you guys like it 😂🤷🏼‍♀️

b1pwye,I just don't want to live with these memories...,"Last year I was finally in a really, really good plae and had all of this treatment that was working amazingly, I'd worked really hard to rebuild my life and be moving forwards and have a plae (therapist's offie) to put all of the things that happened all of these years ago and feel like I was really happy and I would soon understanding the meaning of everything, with only maybe a few things left to disuss in therapy and then I ould lose that hapter. Everything just kept getting better and better. I don't even know how to transition to this but... That was up until Otober last year, and then from November to February I was involved in an ongoing, inespable trauma almost idential muh more signifiant to me now than the original thing that had happened to me. Now, I keep replaying everything that happened then, desperately trying to understand it and getting progressively more violent while this happens. It's like I'm simultaneously trying to avoid it and think about it. I feel like I got left behind in my initial trauma and then time just kept progressing without me when that happened, and now this has happened it's the same thing where I'm just stuk in the moments before it happened onstantly trying to understand why anything ould have happened after that that wasn't aording to my plan that I'd now onvined myself would keep going and just what the fuk happened and until I understand all of these things in my life now I don't give a SHIT about and I also everytime I remember... I just want to kill myself so that I don't have to live with the memories. I am so beyond fuking tempted to just drink soooooooooo muh vodka!! And this is something that I have NEVER done.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I want with this just like... Somebody to enourage me and tell me they're proud of me for everything that I did to ome this far and that if I used to think that my life was worth living then I'll feel like that again and everything will go bak to being amazing just like...

b1q6oo,scared for charges being filed *trigger warning?,"today i got a call after a year of investigating and interviews and a hell of a lot of waiting. My rapist is getting charged with rape in the 3rd degree.  when my advocate told me i was very relieved but seconds later my stomach dropped and my mom said she noticed i was dissociating. i heard the advocate on the phone still talking but i just wasn’t there. my mom told her and she stopped talking for a bit and i came to. i took some deep breaths and she told us more about the process and what the next bit of my life will look like. i am so scared. Especially of his reaction. i’m almost completely sure that he does not know i pursued criminal charges and he is not expecting this. i took him to civil court to try to get a SAPO (basically a restraining order) and just that made him go insane. he found where i live, threatened me in person and online, had his friends intimidate me  by sending photos of their guns and threatening me with my families safety. i am terrified that it will be worse now. he doesn’t seem to care about the consequences of his actions and continues to break the laws. it won’t be his first time in the legal system and i’m just so scared of him. i want to be proud of myself and happy that this is happening but the fear is outweighing that. i don’t know what to do so i’m just trying to enjoy the good feelings before he is served with papers. i haven’t seen him in over a year and i’m planning on going to his arraignment because it’s what i’ve been waiting for. i’m just searching for some type of closure. i don’t really know why i’m posting this but i’m just not sure how to talk to my friends about it and i just need advice or support  or something",jackielewisss,2019-03-16 01:17:37,0,338,20.38,27.71,50.04,13.7,16.9,15.68,92.9,61.83,21.89,17.16,11.24,0.3,0,5.33,0.3,4.73,5.33,12.72,10.06,7.69,8.28,2.66,20.71,3.85,1.78,2.07,0.3,1.78,6.8,2.96,3.85,2.07,1.78,0,11.54,0.89,0.59,1.78,4.14,12.13,2.37,2.07,0.89,2.96,1.18,3.55,2.37,1.18,0.89,0.3,1.78,0.59,0.59,0.59,0,7.69,1.18,1.48,1.78,1.78,2.07,5.62,12.72,1.78,10.06,1.48,2.66,5.33,1.48,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0,0.3,0.3,0,0,0,0,11.54,5.33,0.59,0,0,0.3,0,0,0,4.44,0.59,0.3
b1qeyq,Something is really wrong,"I'm seeing this more and more every day and it's driving me absolutely insane, maybe that's kinda prophetic.  I had a big break after a few really fucked up events and ended up checking in to a ""retreat"" - which was literally one of the first asylums in the US, just modernized - I really want to say at \*\*least\*\* half of the people there just needed a mentor, a few people helping them get some momentum and an honest, compassionate look in the mirror.  Even if it was just 50%, that's a huge number and that's not okay.

In fact, most of the people I've met and gotten to know that are treated as ""crazy"" (quite a few) have actually been incredibly talented and intelligent and genuinely intended well.  The other ones just seemed broken down and desperate.  As far as I can see, all of their stories track back to massive amounts of pain.  Pain brings out the worst in us, the self destruction and collapse, it both saps motivation and throttles rebound momentum.

When you're so weighed down by depression, crushed by anxiety, constantly on alert in case a flashback or panic attack hits, or drained from enduring constant pain and discomfort, the responsibilities of the outside world start turning into individual weighted blankets thrown on your back until you're pulling yourself with your fingertips just to get out of bed in the morning.  Every added obstacle that comes from failures then turns into more weight, it feels like a classic Greek myth of some punishment in Tartarus.  It consumes.  We have had stories about this passed down since the dawn of civilization - demons, ghosts, possession, curses, etc. - why the hell are people unlearning this lesson?  In every analogous story, these afflicted people need a compassionate healer figure in their community who takes them goddamn seriously to help them find peace.  And in every haunting, they play it off, ignore it and downplay it, community thinks they're crazy until it's too late.  These are cautionary tales!

Instead of being compassionate and basically doing their job as a concerned member of society, it feels like people just stigmatize (they're crazy, they're an addict, they're lazy, they're a loser, they want attention because attention is BAD!  It's ""selfish""), throw pills at you because there's clearly something wrong with your brain chemistry, throw spiritual practices at you and get upset when they don't work for you because you already have meditative tools and they suppress a lot of the problems, not solve them, so on and so fucking forth.

Maybe I should put this into perspective a bit.  I have been diagnosed of the past decade with OCD, MDD, Bipolar 2, Partial Seizure Disorder, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Lyme Disease, Anxiety Disorder something or another, and now that they have actual evidence of recent trauma, a PTSD diagnosis.  Since high school, I've always feel like shit and I still have no idea what's wrong. I've been doing this song and dance for 10 years, I've been on all the meds, I've done the programs, I've seen more doctors and therapists than I can count and none of them have a clue how to work with me.  They get frustrated, they misdiagnose, they treat on sight and don't follow up.  You leave and as far as they're concerned, you've fallen off the face of the Earth.  The process alone has traumatized and demoralized me to the point where I don't know who to trust anymore.  All I'm looking for is someone who has a long enough attention span and a big enough heart to try and figure out what is causing this debilitating shit in my life that has me leaving my house like once a week.  Physical, mental, environmental, genetic - I don't care anymore.  I just want the pain to go away.  I think we all have that mantra running through our heads.

I went to the doctor yesterday because I have been having a lot of trouble eating, GI has been completely wrecked since I was like 13 and no one has really explained a single good reason why that's happening, I'm skin and bones, my joints are fucked, I get cold sweats and insane low blood sugar kinda feeling every day, wake up weak and soaking sweat through my sheets, all that.  I literally feel like I'm being eaten alive from the inside, it's like rocket fuel for anxiety.  I try to not be anxious and just wait it out, I get this condescending ""why didn't you come in sooner?"" and if I try to bring it to their attention, they look at me like I'm making it up.  With the cold sweats and stuff, I can't really tell what temperature it is, 65 and 75 feel pretty much the same, so I played it safe and told them I thought I had a fever.  They gave me a face mask and everything, they never even checked my temperature.

I have suspicions there's something fungal related so I brought up a rash I have, I'm not even kidding this doctor didn't even look at it.  She prescribed ketoconizole, which I looked up for med interactions because I don't trust this asshole and I'm now a bit scared to take it even if I've taken it before, everything I'm reading says this med is a last resort.  Here's the best part - I stood up for myself.  She was being condescending and giving me weird looks so I called her out, I took a leap.  I said I was there because I wanted help.  She basically made it out as if my symptoms were not there at all and was searching for ways to prove they weren't there.  I asked her to stop and broke a bit, really pleaded for help.  She went to check my lungs and heart and I, tail between my legs, actually apologized for it and told her I was struggling with PTSD shit and I just want to get better.  You guys are going to LOVE this.  

She asked if I was a veteran, I said no, she said ""oh"" in a tone that I can only describe as annoyed disappointment with a nice spike of 'what're you complaining about'.  Cue awkward passive aggressive silence for a good minute.  I paid $30 for this.  She set me up with a blood lab which I got done months ago that I really didn't want to pay for again so I didn't go, she said she ""couldn't"" order any form of cultures to check for any form of infection because my stools are not 100% liquid?  She also said I didn't have diarrhea because it wasn't complete liquid which I am told is factually inaccurate.  Is this way of being medically treated normal?  I don't know anymore, it's all I see.

I now have to brace for the weekly test of whether I go to my ""counselor"" on Monday or not.  I called him out last meeting hugely, he is unbearably timid and literally talks about the weather and somewhat shared hobbies every time.  Really bad at helping me communicate comfortably, completely on his terms.  He made a comment about my haircut which I cut the day I got out of the retreat - this was last Monday he made this comment, I have been back home for 3 months now.  It broke the camel's back.  I told him ""dude, I haven't left the house in 4 days and you're asking about my hair?!""  We proceeded to argue for 2 hours, the second of which I am really hoping for his sake he didn't charge for.

Now I'm going to preface this next part with a statement - I am very spiritually open-minded and I love discussion about it, world religions is actually a big passion of mine - but someone telling you what you spiritually need is not okay with me.  This integration of Eastern religions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, they're all blending together over here nowadays) into psychotherapy in state funded facilities is something I'm starting to have an ethical issue with.  On a fundamental level, it is pretty clearly a church and state thing, which concerns me a bit.  Philosophic discussion is one thing, religious practices are another.  I don't see a problem at all with people giving suggestions of meditation practices, they all help in their own ways but anyone \*anyone\* with a head on their shoulders who regularly exercises functional meditative practices (not just going through the motions) knows everyone's way is different.  Therapists (teachers, guides, counselors) should be working \*with\* their charge, not giving them homework to figure it out on their own.  Engage.  Seriously.  It's your job.

Telling someone their ego needs reducing when they are at their lowest low and can barely leave their house is not only wrong and unhelpful, it's accusatory and to a certain degree puts that person at risk.  In response, I brought up Freud/Jung and the different perspectives on ego/super-ego/id and the balance within - not elimination of the ego but equilibrium - and I realized he really didn't understand the words he was saying.  He was going through the motions, like the doctor.  Use the template, if the template doesn't fit, change the patient to match the template.  Rinse, repeat.  Oh yeah, this is the guy who has been my ""therapist"" since Fall 2017, watched me endure a crushingly abusive relationship on top of a toxic family and descend to the lowest depression in my life while comfortably spending most of the session talking about the last thing on Netflix he thought was cool.  He watched all this happen, he knew what he was doing wasn't working and he just kept going.  I'm seeing now how really fucked up that is.  

Oh man, I really had to unload there, thank you if you read this far.  I'd love to hear opinions on this really sociopathic viewpoint people seem to have.  Is it just in my region?  Bad luck?  More than anything, I just needed to get this out and hopefully people can start really doing something about this, count me in.  It's literally killing people, lots of them - our state suicide rate is through the roof, it's completely out of control at scary levels.  People need real help.  Community.  Social media and this whole Reddit thing, they help a lot in a lot of ways, but they're not a replacement for social contact.  It's definitely not a replacement for hands-on helping someone out of a deep depression.  Helping them with their lifestyle, hang out, cheer them up, make them feel valued by society.  This whole exiling people from community/society when they need them the most shit needs to stop.",ElmoNeedsAmmo,2019-03-16 01:54:05,17,1797,44.07,54.22,60.48,8.06,20.66,17.92,90.43,56.09,18.42,11.8,6.4,0.39,1.17,1.61,2.23,6.62,5.73,13.41,9.35,6.01,6.18,2.23,18.53,4.4,2.28,1.61,1.11,3.06,7.4,2.89,4.4,0.89,1.11,0.78,12.35,0.06,0.22,0.72,1.06,12.8,2.45,1.73,1.56,2.95,1.95,3.62,2.67,0.89,0.61,1.06,4.12,1.56,1.89,0.28,0.33,7.9,1.95,1.17,3.28,1.17,1.11,5.56,11.69,0.5,13.3,2.23,6.96,4.23,1.67,0.72,0.39,0.22,0.83,0.22,1.34,0.61,0.17,0.28,0.22,0,18.81,4.28,6.12,0,0,0.39,0.17,0.83,1,4.17,0.56,1.28

b1r1az,Fears manifesting in my nightmares,"I’m beginning to lose it. I used to have nightmares about one particular event in my life. But now it’s any and everything I’m afraid of. I think my ptsd is morphing. And there is a lot more trauma under there than just the one event. My dreams are showing me how deeply my abandonment issues lie. And when you begin a new beautiful relationship, that’s not exactly a fun thing to discover. I’m on prazosin for the nightmares but it has almost made things worse. I don’t know how to address my fears of being randomly left or cheated on, but I can’t keep ignoring it. It keeps finding me.

b1rbc3,Think I have PTSD?,"Hi people,  
I'm a 22yo gal that... In theory never had anything too serious happen.  However,  I think I have PTSD from when I was hospitalizedfor a few days for depression when I was 16 and got mistreated by doctors (over- medicated without consulting), a roommate and the situation just generally was not suitable for me at all (I'm autistic,  but we had no idea back then)... 
I was flinching for any mention of the words ' mental health', 'psychiatry' etc for a long time afterwards. Nightmares,  flashbacks...  It's kinda okay in day to day life now,  no more visible reactions except feeling EXTREMELY uncomfortable.  However,  a friend plans on going for a longer inpatient stay in summer and has asked me to visit. And now it's all back,  the flinching,  the nightmares,  the depression...   And I'm scared. I can't really get therapy (moving +waiting lists...)  and it's like I'm drowning.... 

My boyfriend gets a lot of it. But I also have a history of codependency and am scared of that... 

Any advice?",siorez,2019-03-16 04:03:41,8,176,41.76,16.7,97.1,1,11.73,21.02,90.34,55.68,13.07,9.09,8.52,0.57,0,0,0,3.98,7.39,12.5,10.23,8.52,8.52,3.41,17.61,3.98,1.7,1.14,0.57,3.98,5.11,0.57,4.55,1.7,0,1.14,6.82,0,1.7,0.57,0.57,14.2,2.27,0.57,0,3.98,2.27,5.11,1.14,0.57,0,0.57,3.41,0,3.41,0,0,6.25,2.84,0.57,1.14,1.7,0,4.55,11.93,1.7,16.48,2.27,6.82,9.09,1.14,0,0.57,0,0,0.57,1.14,0,0.57,0.57,0,0,34.66,15.91,6.25,0,0,1.14,0,0.57,0,6.82,3.41,0.57
b1sbab,A favour...,"I just wanna start off by saying that I HATE MYSELF so much right now for doing this. None of you could imagine, but I REALLY need to reach out to some of you, so here I am, slowly regretting it, but doing it anyway.

I'm only 18 years old, I'm a university student studying Mechatronic Engineering. I've suffered from depression. Or at least I think that I have. I've been so lonely for as long as I can remember. And I still get this feeling of emptiness from time to time.

But being the little boy that I am, I've always looked up to superheroes. Especially to how they went through the most horrible things, but instead of hurting others, or themselves, they chose to help people out. I figured that it does make things a bit easier. And it was true. Even the tiniest of gestures. Seeing somebody happy made ME happy.

Now I don't know what I'm doing here. I think this may even be a huge mistake. But at least I'll go down trying, right?

So I thought long and hard and came up with an idea.  I want to do what I can to make sure that NOBODY feels this way, because it's dark, and lonely out there and because nobody should go through any of it. So I went online and built a website. I called it Alleviate. Which is a word that means to make problems less severe. It's just a community. It came to mind that people may not be able to afford therapists. So I thought that one approach could be to have all of us help each other out under one platform. You can follow a certain topic ranging from ADHD, postpartum depression, anxiety, and many more. There is a full disclaimer that the site doesn't offer a cure, or any of that, It's just a place for ranting and helping each other feel even just a LITTLE better.

Here's a link to the website: [https://alleviate.mn.co](https://alleviate.mn.co/)

I promise, all I want to do is help and all I ask from you is for any of you to just check it out, and if you want to join, you can sign up. I want a place for us and ONLY us. And while there is this subreddit and many more, it still doesn't feel like ours. And if I see that this idea helps people and actually benefits them, I'll turn it into a real thing from scratch.

All I ask for you to do is check it out and if you feel like you could maybe benefit from it, please sign up. The number of members that I get there would be an indicator of whether this should be built or not. All I want to do is help. I'm not making any money from this whatsoever. Its ALL free and I'm not planning or going to allow any advertising or anything. It's just something that I wanted to do that was ""good"". I'm just an 18 year old kid in his first year of university. If you hate  on me after this, I understand.  I feel like a dipshit for posting something like this here, because I'm the type that hates the people that do this and here I am doing it. I deserve whatever comes my way.

Thanks anyway though.",zula8989,2019-03-16 06:15:06,7,573,19.51,30.02,66.53,28.68,13.64,12.04,92.5,63.18,22.34,11.69,8.2,0.7,1.92,0.17,0.7,10.65,4.71,13.09,11.17,6.98,8.55,1.75,19.9,3.32,2.79,1.05,0.87,4.36,5.76,2.97,2.79,0.35,0.52,1.4,6.98,0,0,0,0.35,17.45,3.32,1.75,3.66,4.36,2.09,4.71,2.44,0.7,0.17,1.57,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,6.28,2.09,1.05,2.62,1.22,0.17,2.27,14.66,1.22,11.17,2.27,6.11,2.97,1.05,0,0,0.35,0,0,1.05,0.17,0.35,0,0,0.35,17.98,8.2,4.36,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,0.35,3.49,0.35,0.87
b1sbdn,I was diagnosed without even knowing,"It was my therapist before this one I have now. He always played a role that seemed more like he was trying to befriend me than help me, which made me uncomfortable. I had a pretty traumatic incident (or at least it seemed traumatic to 13 year old me) Huly 2nd of 2018 where I was physically cornered by family members because I did something they didnt feel necessary (I hid behind a shed because I had a panic attack and self harmed because of built up anxiety, breaking my 1 1/2 year clean streak). Anyway, I finally found it in myself about a month after this incident to ask my therapist if he thought I had PTSD. He looked at me all confused and said ""I already diagnosed you with that 6 months ago when we met."" I was confused. I replied with ""Um... I dont think you did. You diagnosed me with anxiety, panic disorder, vender dysphoria, and depression, but never PTSD"" he then pulls up my diagnosis sheet and sure as shit there it is. One of the first things he diagnosed me with. I was relieved and angry at the same time. I felt validated for all these months I've struggled with locking myself in school bathrooms because I was having flashbacks or dissociating really hard, but why the fuck wasnt I told about this sooner?? I could have been looking for resources specifically based around PTSD and help for that instead of just generalized anxiety. I could have told my school that I had that and put that on my 504 plan instead of just generalized anxiety. I ended up discontinuing our sessions after we were in an LGBT group therapy and he called me que*r multiple times just to spite the fact I didnt like it(which I know people use it in a positive term, but that was 1. Something that was continuously shouted at me during the incident in July and 2. I'd been called that by my Dad and bullies for the last 3 years as a slur, so I wasnt comfortable with that.) 

On a bright note I now have a GREAT therapist, who's very open and down to business with me. Ibe told him more in the 2-3 months I've seen him than I ever told the last guy.

I don’t know what’s happening. Two days ago I had a bad dream. It wasn’t like a memory or anything, just a weird dream. I always have strange bad dreams, so I thought it was nothing unusual. But this one made me uneasy, and I can’t stop thinking about it? And the more I think about it, the more uneasy I feel. It reminded me of all my nonsense childhood bad dreams and I can’t put my finger on why or what or how but I feel like there’s a hole in my memory about some deeply disturbing event and my mind is trying to remind me of it. But I really don’t know what it is.

The dream is a bunch of nonsense, literally. But it made me feel really uneasy, both while I was dreaming and now while I’m awake, thinking about it. I don’t know what it is, or if I’m just being stupid, but I don’t know. I really don’t know. Feels like there’s something missing.

b1u5w0,I need to get this off my chest *WARNING THIS STORY INVOLVES CHILDREN*,"*warning this story involves children*


I’ll start this off with a little back story so it makes more sense. I got married very young, moved across the country as my spouse was in the military. He became abusive and a repetitive cheater after his deployment about three years into our marriage. At one of my various jobs I connect with a woman a few years older then me but in my same situation, an abusive husband. We stopped working together but continued to be very close. Her husband left and moved to a new state she stayed with two children, a girl 7 and a boy 2. She got her own place and by this time I was being evicted due to my ex refusing to help me. She offered me to come stay with her as it would help us both save money and we could take care of the kids together by this time they were like my niece and nephew. Fast forward shit hits the fan and we are being evicted out of the place because neither of our spouses will help us and even both working full time we don’t make enough. So we start packing find a place that’s cheaper. Things are looking up, this is where the story takes a turn. 

A normal Saturday morning the kids are running around, coloring, playing like usual coming in out of the room my best friend and I share. This particular morning I stayed in bed while I thought she was up and out in the living room with the kids. The next thing I know my best friend is shaking me awake and has a prescription pill bottle in her hand and is asking me how many pills were in the bottle, I’m weary eyed and trying to see I confirm the bottle was empty as I had taken the last pill but hadn’t thrown the bottle out yet. She’s in a panic and runs out of the room, I jump up and follow. Remember we’re moving so there’s boxes everywhere and the house is a wreck. I get to the dining area where I had placed my purse and it’s on the floor contents everywhere. I have insomnia so I take an over the counter sleeping pill that looks like a blue gel tab. Were sifting through the mess and my best friend says there’s something wrong with Sam. (Not his real name), the 2 year old. About that same moment I find my sleeping pill bottle completely empty. There was no less then 50 pills in that bottle. With in seconds Sam falls to the floor and begins seizing. The 7 year old is standing right in the middle of all this, my best friend grabs Sam and runs to the hallway as I’m calling 911. The 7 year old loses it, while trying to console her I talk to 911, in hindsight they show up within 3 minutes and they get him loaded in to the ambulance. There’s at least 3 cop cars an ambulance and a fire truck. This is the moment I snap. I become hysterical and I call my mom. It’s 4 am where she is located and she had given birth to my youngest sibling about 6 hours prior. She assured me everything will be fine I grab the 7 year old we get in the car and follow to the hospital. We get there and wait in the lobby about 15 mins. I get her a snack she eats some and says she wants to save the rest for her brother. Realizing that I am the adult in the situation I keep my composure for her. A nurse calls us back to sit in the family room were walking in about the same time as my best friend. She looks like she seen a ghost, there’s a man there as well her is the hospital priest not sure what they are actually called. In the smallest voice my best friend says, “he’s gone”. I begin to scream and we all are hysterical. I leave the room and in the hallway of the hospital I call my mom and I can’t even speak. I tell her they called his time of death as 10:15 am. All the movies and the shows were people fall out on the floor and cry hysterically in the movies, that’s about what this scene looked like. By this time cops and cps had shown up. We both interview and then we went home, they searched the house and in the end we were both found not guilty of any wrong doing by both agencies. 

This plagues me everyday. There are so many unanswered questions. How did he get the bottle open? Did I shut it fully the night before? How did he manage to get 50+ pills down? I could have prevented this. I am young, I was nothing but 21 and I had no kids. Never in my life did I think something as simple as setting my purse on the table would destroy so  many lives. He was 2 he had so much life to live. This a guilt that eats at me everyday. It’s been 10 months. What makes me feel even more guilty is that my best friend never blamed me, never once turn her back on me when friends and family called me a baby murder, she stuck up for me. This made me think of myself as a person. Could I have been so forgiving? So understanding? Handled this with as much strength and grace as she did? As for the present we are still best friends. She moved back home with her family and Sam is buried here where I live. I go as often as I can but it’s hard.  

I know this was lengthy, but thank you all for the opportunity to share. This bothers me everyday of my life. I had clinical depression long before this happens  and now I feel like I’m not even a person anymore. The images in my head of watching him die right there in the hallway will forever be burned into my memory.",Freespiritleo,2019-03-16 09:19:48,3,1049,50.75,65.92,78.99,22.81,15.89,11.53,92.09,56.91,18.78,14.2,8.2,1.72,0.1,3.62,0.57,4.58,7.82,12.96,8.29,5.43,7.63,1.33,18.68,6.01,4.48,1.05,2.29,2.1,4.58,2.19,2.38,0.48,0.76,0.48,13.16,1.53,0.86,3.05,1.62,6.86,1.81,0.76,0.67,0.76,1.72,1.24,2.76,1.33,0.57,0.76,3.15,0.67,2.1,0,1.05,9.82,4.29,1.62,3.05,2.19,0.67,5.34,11.06,0.86,18.88,2.67,10.01,7.15,0.57,0.67,1.24,0.19,0.1,0.57,0.29,0.1,0,0,0.1,0,10.96,5.62,1.91,0.1,0,0.57,0,0,0.19,1.91,0.19,0.48
b1u5ye,Feeling so traumatized. Need advice on how to cope.,"Ahhhhhhh. So I’m 26 and last Friday I found out I have thyroid cancer. It was a major bomb drop of course and I was shocked. Everything considered I think I responded well to the news and processed things in a completely normal way with good days and bad days. It was major and overwhelming but overall fine.

I was unsure if I was ready to go to work but I decided to try it and see how it went. I’m a nurse and work on a labour and delivery unit.

Anywayyyy..

Second day back. My 35 week pregnant patient has a massive hemorrhagic stroke in front of our eyes a couple hours into my shift with her baby still inside. They did an emergency c section and transferred her to another hospital for brain surgery. It was the most disturbing and horrific thing I have ever witnessed in my entire life. Her husband was right beside us. She was in hospital overnight for high blood pressure which is probably what caused the stroke.

I found out this morning she’s had a lot of swelling post op and they don’t know if she will make it. To put things into perspective. A mom hasn’t died at our hospital in 30 years. 

My soul is crushed. I am absolutely destroyed. I keep playing it over in my mind. I can’t stand the thought of her not recovering. She’s in ICU in an induced coma. If she dies I feel like I will never get over it and ever be able to return to the career that I loved so much. I absolutely could not go back to the area in the hospital where it happened which makes me so sad because I loved my job soooo much. I know this will never happen again but just being there would be such a reminder and bring back all the awful memories.

What I’m asking is how do you move forward from a traumatic situation? How do you cope and move on with your life when it causes you so much pain? I plan to see a therapist about this but in the short term how do you get by?

I’ve gone from being a perfectly well adjusted, happy young adult to a compete shattered mess.

b1wv9o,Recovery is slow because memories are slowly coming back,"(Warning for discussion of child abuse by another child.)
It's been almost five years since I broke things off with my abuser, but I'm still dealing with pretty intense issues from what I went through. I think my problem is it went on for so long and I don't remember it all. With my ex, I only dated him for a few months, and while I certainly dissociated when he was abusing me, I remember the majority of what happened. That's been much easier to process. With the childhood abuse, it's just...a mess. I didn't remember a HUGE chunk of it until last year, and I know there's stuff I don't remember now. Stuff resurfaces randomly. It's been an ongoing process for five years.

It's hard because I feel like I should be over it, and I feel like my family forgets that I'm still ""in the trenches"" with it or whatever. They forget that I get triggered really fucking easily. I hate that I do, so it's really hard to remind them. They care, but they didn't see all the abuse. To them, it was years ago. It's not in their brains all the time.

Does anyone else understand or have suggestions? I was with this person from around age 3 or 4 until I was 15. We were best friends but she ended up treating it more like a relationship. I was emotionally abused, cut off from all other friends, made to feel like my family was the enemy....and then last year I remembered some of the sexual abuse. And I know I don't remember all of it. I think I was raped, but that memory is so vague it feels like a dream.
Now, as a 20-year-old queer college student who's never had consensual sex or a healthy relationship, I just...I struggle. My memory is AWFUL because chronic illness causes brain fog but I think more than that, my brain got used to dissociating and just goes to that when it can. I don't know.

Sorry this is rambly. I'm just struggling today.",risingsun1999,2019-03-16 13:23:07,0,360,16.75,13.93,97.47,1,13.33,14.17,94.17,59.72,23.33,13.61,10.83,0.28,0,0.83,1.67,9.72,4.17,12.22,11.39,5.83,8.06,2.22,20.56,4.17,3.06,1.67,1.67,3.33,7.5,1.94,5.56,0.56,3.06,0.56,6.94,0.56,0.56,0.28,0.56,16.67,5.56,2.22,0.56,2.78,1.94,4.72,1.94,0.28,0,1.67,2.78,0.83,0.56,1.39,0,6.11,1.94,0.56,2.78,0.83,0.56,8.06,13.33,0.56,13.06,1.67,3.06,9.17,0.56,0.83,0.56,0,0,0,0.56,0.28,0,0,0,0,21.11,9.72,4.44,0,0,0.28,0,0.56,0.56,5,0.56,0
b1wvu7,Wondering about a diagnosis,"I've been seeing a therapist recently, and she said I may have PTSD. It was never something I considered, but she's the professional.

My dad was an alcoholic (unbeknownst to me at the time) and he died of liver failure when I was eleven. I hadn't seen him in a month up to that point, he stayed at our lakehouse when he wanted to be alone and distance himself from everything. 

My mom woke me up that morning, told me he'd died, and drove us up to the lakehouse. I was in such a shock, I didn't know what to do or feel. My last memory of him was seeing his body hoisted up on a stretcher by EMTs. I walked into the house and saw the dried blood on the chairs, couch, and floor. He'd been bleeding internally and had started to cough it up, among other ways which I won't go into.

A year later my mom gets diagnosed with cancer, and she died when I was 15 after a long struggle with the disease. She started to get dementia towards the end, and couldn't remember my name. My dad was gone a lot because of his job, and presumably his alcoholism too, so my mom was everything to me. She wasn't the best mom by any means, I vividly remember her selling prescription pills to people in our house, smoking weed in front of me and my older sister. Her and my dad never slept in the same bed. Looking back on it, it was a pretty strange environment. Not abusive by any means, just...odd.

My sister started drinking heavily after my mom died and she'd been accepted to college. She got a few DUIs, the last one resulted in her having a horrible car accident, and she almost died. We'd moved in with my grandparents since my mom had passed, my dad's family wanted nothing to do with us after he died and they gathered up the belongings they felt belonged to them.

My sister put a lot of stress on my grandparents and me. Many times I'd have to pick her up from bars where she'd been kicked out, she was a violent sort of drunk and took it out on me quite a few times. I knew she was just self medicating, she'd been through the same things I had.

Thankfully she's recovered since and is doing much better. During all of this, though, I was in the background. I was always the quiet kid, never spoke up or really opened up to anyone. I suppose looking back that by that point, I felt like I had no real foundation, no support system.

Somehow I managed to not touch any alcohol or drugs but my problems would lie elsewhere. Since my dad died, I've had this sort of nervousness, or fear if you will. One example is the year after he died, my friend convinced me to play with him on the little league baseball team. I thought it might cheer me up, so I did, but I found that I couldn't bring myself to swing the bat. I'd played baseball for years leading up to that, I had no issues before. This time, I just couldn't swing. The whole year, I didn't get a single hit. I just felt so numb, inadequate, almost defeated, but I was far too young to articulate the things I was feeling. My mom was still alive and fairly healthy at this point, I often wonder why she didn't take me aside and try to encourage me. I feel like it would've helped me immensely just to feel like someone was in my corner. After that year, I never played sports or committed to any sort of extracurricular activity again.

My philosophy during these times was just to push through, once I got older and on my own, I'd be okay. I did fairly well in high school, got into one of the best colleges in the region studying computer science. From the moment I arrived on campus, I had that fear. I changed my major from everything to computer science, to criminal justice, to nursing. I wasn't good enough for any of it. I kept good grades and scholarships but I just kept pushing the feelings down.

My grandpa died in my sophomore year, and shortly after that, things started to really head south for me. I stopped going to class, instead I'd just drive around town, or stay in my room and not come out. Everything I'd pushed down started to come out. I found myself crying while talking about things that had nothing to do with emotion or anything remotely sad. I decided to drop out of school, I didn't care anymore.

That was two years ago. Since then I've worked in a factory, waited tables, done all sorts of things to scrape by. I feel like an utter disappointment to my grandma and sister, they're all I have left. I've had moments of sheer panic because I feel inadequate, like I'm all alone. I've abandoned good relationships and friendships for the same reason. I started seeing a therapist recently, I'd always assumed I just had depression with some anxiety but she told me to consider the trauma itself, and the effect it could possibly have had on me. She gave me a book to read, which I'm going to pick up sometime this week, Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl. Hopefully reading a similar account will help me feel less alone.

So this all leaves me wondering, to the point of this post, could I really have had PTSD for almost 12 years and never realized it? I'm not sure. All I know is that I'm tired of feeling inadequate, I'm tired of feeling alone and numb. I don't want to give up. I just want a normal, stable life. I'm tired of being afraid, so I'm taking a step to get help and open up, which is so hard for me to do.

I just discovered this sub and thought I'd try to reach out. Regardless of what diagnosis I may actually have once my therapist gets to that point, I'm trying to hang in there.

b20n7r,Painful public display,"First time poster.

TLDR:  Had a public panic attack on big night for SO in front of their coworkers.

My SO just completed a major, multi year project this week.  I was in from out of town, currently LDR, but was out celebrating the eventual move to my current city.  

A few years back while I lived in the same general location, I was sexually assaulted.  Took me years to come to terms with what had happened to me, and took me a while longer to admit to SO the precise details of what occurred.  I don’t wish to provide details.  I moved out of the area last year, and while there was initial improvement, it has been creeping back into my life.

Since the assault, I’ve become increasingly isolated.  I avoid most social gatherings, keep strangers at a distance, spend lots of time alone with my pets, and have been entirely focused on my career.  Since we are not in the same city at the moment, I have come to terms with living on my own time and own schedule.  If I don’t want to be around people, I stay put.  SO has been so busy with their work that I didn’t want to bother them with details of why I was avoiding people.  Until last night I’ve never been in a position when out in public with loud noises, people drinking, where I wasn’t able to immediately leave when I started to feel uncomfortable.

When I was starting to feel uncomfortable I left the location and went outside.  Walked around for a bit.  SO texted me to return and I told them that I needed a minute before coming back.  I wasn’t even aware in the moment that being back in the same town as the attack would trigger a flight response.

After returning to the loud and crowded bar I just wanted to avoid all contact with SO and others.  I just wanted to return home but was unable to communicate WHY I was having difficulty sitting still or staying put.  All I knew is that I didn’t want to be around all of the people, and I just wanted to go home.  This was a big night for them, and I didn’t want them to stop and take care of me.  I wanted them to bask in their success with others, and just let me be.  I tried telling them that I wasn’t trying to ruin their event, and that I had reached my absolute limit for the evening.  I felt I was being guilted into staying and was told that I was “ruining their event.”

And this is when it became very public.  My SO was intoxicated and upset with me.  I was also intoxicated and becoming more flighty as time went on.  I eventually Ubered to a hotel where I stayed the night to avoid a painful drunken confrontation.  I am embarrassed that it came to this.

Talking the next day I was able to fully process and explain that going to this small town had filled me dread for years.  They didn’t even make the connection that any of this could be a trigger for me, and I feel like complete shit that all of my SO colleagues, who otherwise liked my company up until this point, saw me at my absolute worst.

I don’t understand what happened.  In the right circumstances and places I can handle my alcohol and surroundings very well.  But the combination of all these events created what could have been the perfect shit storm.

I don’t want this ever happen again.  We worked out that I needed to confront this now - to stop avoiding therapy and working my way through my PTSD.  I don’t even like using the term.

I don’t even know where to start or what to do.  Sorry for the length.

b21is9,Self-Destructive Coping Mechanisms,"TW: Self Harm

I’ve been dealing with depression, anxiety, and PTSD for two years now, and I always seem to employ unhealthy and destructive coping mechanisms in order to keep on. For a year, I self-harmed. I self-sabotage everything in my life. I talk down to myself. I recently started drinking. I don’t know what else to do. I have no family or friends who support me, and struggle to afford therapy. Everywhere I look for help, or for a coping mechanism that doesn’t involve potentially hurting myself or others, I get, “Stay hydrated! Practice meditation! Go for a run!” I’m so sick of seeing that. Never has mediation, yoga, or joining a gym helped me with anything. Deep breathing exercises don’t do shit. Don’t tell me a juice cleanse is going to fix me, because neither that, going vegan, or drinking more water is going to stop the demons I face everyday. I just don’t know what else to do.

b225ae,Can someone please reassure that I’m not going to get killed?,"Long story short... I met my friend Timothy four years ago on this gaming chat site. We became great friends.. no odd behavior was shown by him.. we would text for hours about games, our scores and how we can work our way up the leaderboards.. well, that normality went on for about two years. On the third year, Timothy started exhibited odd behavior. He insinuated he was into illegal porn and stuff like that, but I took it as a joke because he would always joke around all the time. (By now he has my phone number) That went on for the rest of the year. On the fourth year, he would joke around about raping minors every day of the week. He did it for about six months.. then some idiot leaks my first and last name to him and state, so then that makes me paranoid. By then, I block him and I haven’t spoken to him in a year. It’s been a year.. blocked Timothy on all social media, I removed all my online shit, I’m totally ghosted. He never said he would hurt me... and he probably understands why I left.. I think. Maybe not. Anyways. I’ve been having paranoia all year that he’s going to come after me and kill me for leaving the friendship. He never said that though. Is this a form of PTSD? Will he really track me down with my first and last and kill me? His toxic behavior makes me paranoid enough to believe that even though I know he won’t... but I need reassurance. Please help me.

b22w6w,"After an intense PTSD episode, I arranged a visit with my childhood sexual assaulter and I am so grateful that we got to chat","For background, it was a one time occurrence that happened when I was 7. His parents are friends with my parents. He had always be at the back of my mind, for years after the incident.

When he showed up to the event that was hosted at his parents house, (I should note that he has moved out a long time ago and so I was not expecting him t show up) I locked myself in the bathroom and bawled my eyes out. How would he react to seeing me? Would he even recognize me? What will my parents think of us being in the same room again since the incident? What will his parents think?

So I stayed in the bathroom, constantly psyching myself up to get out, but then failing to open the door. My mom knocked on the door and said, “is it because of ___”?!? as if it shouldn’t affect me anymore. (Cue eye roll). I said yes. We left the house.... 

ANYWAYS...

after that event, I decided that I had better meet up with ____ to see him in a different way. Holy cow, he is nothing like he was 11 years ago. I see him in a completely different way. It seemingly didn’t affect him at all, he never thought of me, which was a disappointment, but I think he was sorry once he realized how much i was hurt by the incident.

b24g9h,R*** jokes at the party.,"Some guys were talking about how it doesn't matter what gender you are walking home in the dark because everyone can get shot. That the concern is not rape but being mugged or randomly shot. I said ""what are you talking about, rape happens all the time"" the conversation is a bit of a blur because I was VERY overwhelmed and there were a lot of people talking at once.  So I'm not sure what he replied but another man there was a bit loud and jokingly (loudly) asked if I ""knew this from experience"" I was stunned and I didn't really know how to process this. I replied "" well ..yeah....so..."" very quietly.
What I meant to say was ""yes. I've been sexually assaulted and have many friends who have been raped, one multiple times. There are stories of women getting raped on streets that I walked by that same night, my friend saw someone getting raped in an alley coming home from work. Yeah i have experience being woman, obviously you dont, since you're asking this stuoid question.""

Instead of that I said ""well ..yeah....so..."" and then I realized that I just implied that I was raped when I was not. I just lied to these people, some of which are my good friends (NOT the rape jokers)

There was silence after I said that but somehow the conversation picked up again and now much longer I heard jokes about consent. I left as soon as I could after. Came home and broke down.


It's the next day and I'm trying to figure out if I even said that because nobody reacted, none of my good friends texted me after or were concerned about what just happened. I know that these friends aren't careless asshole so if they think I just told a room of people I was raped they would react. My friend was concerned because of the content of the jokes was upsetting, but not because of what I said. So I'm starting to think noone took it that way or didn't hear me. Maybe I trailed off after I said 'well'.

b26hu5,Is this really possible?,"My brain is a freaking mess, won't let go of anything until it can make sense of crap. I'd like to think I'm just going through some cliché mid-life crisis, but my brain has picked up on all this past stuff and interwoven it with the present. I guess my question is, is it possible for me to have functioned pretty normally for the last couple decades (minus some short-term depression, minimal anxiety) and then just completely crash in to this? From everything I think I know professionally, and everything I read, this is something people typically struggle with either ongoing or at least somewhat closer to their trauma even if it's a few years out.  My problem is my crash is happening so long later, I can't wrap my brain around this really being about that, or figuring out why I can't manage it better this much later in my life.

I've never really claimed my own experiences, or at least thought about them more as chronic stress, just shitty moments, etc. and moved on. Now I can't pull myself out at all, the things I've told myself/did over previous years just no longer work and I'm terrified of where I've been over the last 6 months.

b2bgan,Supportive Partners of people with deep rooted trauma: what goes into one?,"Second post on this sub.  Sorry for wall of text.

I have another post describing a recent public panic attack brought on by a specific trigger.  It was one that I was not expecting as it never happened to me before that night.  After unpacking the situation with my SO, I am feeling less and less supported by their behavior and actions.  It is causing me to worry.

My question:  what does appropriate support from a partner look like with someone dealing with deep rooted trauma?  

There are multiple lifelong traumas (yay me) but a recent sexual assault within the last few years has left me reeling, and normal ways of dealing with other life issues has made the situation untenable with myself and the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.

After my episode I accepted my actions fully.  Explained where it was coming from and how it was the first time in a long time I had been in a situation where I wasn’t able to leave a location when I wasn’t feeling comfortable.  However, I have been told things like “you are a mean drunk” (my partner) and “my friends (that were there) say you’re a mean drunk.”  These people don’t know anything about me, and my partner, largely absent the last year, isn’t fully aware of the obvious signs that I have been broadcasting that I am not coping well.   I feel that when I attempted to remove myself from the situation when I felt something (albeit not knowing what it was at the time) coming on I was doing the right thing.  I am only know learning how a brain dealing with trauma reacts when confronted with these types of things - I’m new to this.  Anyway, in the end I made a drunken spectacle of me, my issues, and hurt my partner when I needed to escape the hell out of the situation I was in. 

I have never been described by anyone as being anything but jovial and enjoyable to be around, and someone that knows when to stop when they have had enough.  

I do not accept that my behavior of the evening in question was remotely acceptable.  I made my first appointment today with a trauma therapist.  However, at what point is rubbing someone’s nose in the mess on the rug border on...for lack of a better word, more harmful than helpful?

I am not using my experience and pain as a excuse to get away with whatever I want.  I own my mistakes and try to not make them more than once.  But I feel that there are better approaches, and my partner is conflating past over drinking episodes (spread apart by years) as being all the same.  They aren’t.  Drinking made the situation worse, that’s on me.  Had I known this could happen I wouldn’t have gone out.  Again, this is a first for me.",FluffyCuntWaffle,2019-03-17 16:22:02,2,502,45.01,12.4,98.45,12.55,18.59,16.73,93.03,60.36,19.72,11.95,10.76,0,0.4,0,0.8,7.77,6.77,14.94,10.16,5.38,6.37,2.79,19.32,6.77,4.18,3.19,1.39,1.59,6.18,2.59,3.59,0.4,0.8,0.4,5.58,0,1.39,0,0,14.74,3.98,2.59,1.59,2.19,1,3.78,2.39,0.2,0.2,1.59,2.39,0.4,0.8,0.2,1,4.78,1.59,1.39,0.6,0.8,0.8,6.77,10.16,0.6,17.13,2.59,7.37,6.77,0.4,1,0.2,0.2,0.2,0,0.8,0.2,0,0.2,0.2,0.2,14.34,5.38,2.99,0.4,0,0.6,0,0.2,0.8,1.99,1.99,0

b2i89v,My Journey (trigger warning),"I settle down under my weighted comforter, with my ice water next to my bed, each night. 
I have to have water with me at all times. This was drilled into my head, while in the Navy. 

Invariably:m, The first thought to coalesce in my weary brain is this: 
""I hope I'm too tired to dream."" 
followed promptly by the thought: 
""I hope HE isn't in my dreams, again. Living through the actual event, in person, the first time was horrendous enough."" 

These are the thoughts I have almost every night, as I steel myself against whatever horrors my brain can cook up, while I'm unconscious. 

""It's just a dream."", ""This too shall pass."", ""Think happy thoughts at bedtime."", &amp; ""It's all mind-over-matter"" are the idioms spewed by those who mean well, but have no grasp of what it means to have an INCURABLE &amp; life-long mental illness brought on by trauma/ or tragedy, that causes paranoia, jealousy, distrust, night terrors, anxiety, agoraphobia, sleep paralysis, insomnia, etc. 

Go to therapy... 
Take a pill... 
Meditate...

Do any Vets find these methods helpful? 
SOME DO, but a lot of us don't... 

""You have PTSD? You served in the military?"" 
-Yes, BUT, not all PTSD stems from having served in the military... 

""Did you even serve in combat theater?"" 
-Yes, however, I was not on the front lines. 

""If you never saw battle; how can you have PTSD?"" 
-I was stalked and harrassed for 3 years by a fellow shipmate, then I was raped by him. 
""OH."" 

I was processed out of the United States Navy, 13 years ago, on a medical discharge. 

***Honorable Discharge: but cannot reenlist*** 

I felt like a failure. 
Like a loser. 
Like I was weak and inadequate. 
I felt as though I had let my family down, disgraced them even... 

I had mental instability that I had not yet found a clear, succinct reason for. I had anger, bitterness, resentment, distrust, anxiety, depression, and so much more. 

I was overwhelmed and undiagnosed. 

Over the course of the next 7 years; I was misdiagnosed: 
-bipolar (manic-depressive)
-borderline personality disorder 
-acute generalized depression 
-chronic depression  
-obsessive compulsive disorder 
-panic disorder 
-generalized anxiety disorder 

 I was prescribed a few different medications to treat these misdiagnosed conditions.

SURPRISE! Nothing worked. 
Well... Paxil worked, but I felt lifeless... 
Zombie-ish, even. 

I myself had never even considered PTSD as a diagnosis, because: 

1) I, like so many people, thought PTSD was something WAR vets got. 
2) I'm neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist; so, I blindly figured my case was cut and dry amd that if I was diagnosed with something -- it was what I actually suffered from. 

Never in a million years would I have guessed that so many mental illnesses, developmental disorders,  (and learning disabled even) had various overlapping symptoms, that made it quite difficult for even the most knowledgeable Mental Health physicians to properly diagnose. 

Then I saw an article on Facebook about victims (I prefer the term SURVIVORS) of sexual assault/ trauma having PTSD. 

This was my AH HAH moment, and I felt giddy with anticipation of possibly being properly diagnosed; once and for all. 

I repeatedly mentioned to my Dr. ALL of the symptoms I had been experiencing, and also made a point to express concern that I might have PTSD, while trying to remain respectful of my Doctor's advice and years of study and experience in the field. 

It took a couple years BUT I was tentatively diagnosed with PTSD and my meds were replaced with an antipsychotic and a sleeping pill. 

This latest change in medicine seemed to work on my most worrisome symptoms -- HOWEVER, one of the meds made my face, arms, and hands constantly tingle while the drug was still in my system. 
Which, btw, made it difficult if not impossible to fall asleep. 

I once again went back to the Dr., my antipsychotic was changed, and I was also given an antihistamine that was supposed to help me fall asleep faster. 

The hope was to get me to fall asleep, stay asleep, and NOT have night terrors. 

While falling asleep was easier now, staying asleep was NOT, because the dreams persisted. 

I've since then added an indica/sativa marijuana blend to my medicine regime, to help with sleep. 

Some nights, I forget to smoke, and I have terrible night terrors. 

Other nights; I smoke and feel okay. On those nights, I sleep deeper and less fitfully; HOWEVER, I still have weird dreams. 

Smoking MJ has reduced the incidences of me waking up screaming and/ or crying, and shaking. 

There are still nights where I end up waking up from the vivid horrors in my dreams, and stay up, with all the lights on.

b2ipn6,Is it possible to be your old self without therapy and medication? How?,"Is it possible to be your old self without therapy and medication?

TL;DR: I have gone through traumatizing experiences for a few months non-stop and now have PTSD. I can’t afford therapy or treatment - but arbitrarily speaking, I have lost almost 80% of my mental capabilities. While it looks like at least some part of it is coming back to me, I have zero hope for full recovery or my future. Have you been there and regained your capabilities? How?

Not to step into a Heraclitan debate - my desire isn’t to be my old self 100% (whatever that implies) but it is to restore at least some part of my mental capacity which I have lost to a trauma.

I’m not sure why I’m putting this out here, I’m not a redditor. The only post I have ever tried writing here about moving abroad got deleted by mods saying they were getting a lot of messages from new users - not even sure this one will go through. But I see a lot of casual articles collecting stories on people supporting each other on Reddit so maybe I wanted to take a chance.

I didn’t have an easy life or a happy childhood or whatever, and I have gotten to where I was before the trauma through constant hardship and struggle - but I was in a very good place in my career, I was respected, valued and looked up to. Despite all odds, I had this firm belief in my capability, my drive and my ability to pull through whatever I set my mind to. Fast forward to today:

A while ago I have moved to a new country and have landed in two abusive workplaces back to back. I’m coming from a lower-mid income family and securing finances is EVERYTHING to me; so I had been a workaholic for all of my adult life just to make sure nobody could even remotely think I wasn’t good at my job or that I wasn’t a valuable resource enough to keep. Imagine being that kind of a person and quitting the company which brought you to a whole new country in maybe 20 days without having a Plan B - that company was that extreme of a case. 

I was definitely not in a good place mentally after that resignation, as I was freaking out for my income, for my residence permit in this country, and for my husband who also was struggling in his new company as it was hard to read what people were thinking of his job - so we were constantly on the edge. I immediately started looking for a job. In a short time this local branch of a big company wanted to work with me. Without thinking much I said yes to them because the worst case, they would be paying me a nice salary while I secretly looked for other jobs, and the best case, I would love working there and be permanent. Worst choice ever. In my industry, but especially in this country, the worst case isn’t that you are unhappy at work but still get paid. It is that people would pull everything to break your will, spirits, motivation and your sanity. I have experienced what is possibly one of the worst cases of harassment and abuse from my boss. I would say every single item you might find in “workplace harassment” definitions except for the physical and sexual assault has happened during those 3 months. I was under a feeling of terror every minute I worked there, I was afraid to go to the bathroom. I was afraid of going into the pantry to get a cup of coffee. I was afraid of talking to people. There were things happening that I could never anticipate or defend myself against that I started having heart problems. My heart rate and blood pressure were always abnormal and I was unfit to work because I would collapse or start having hyperventilations once in a while. I can actually go and check the amount of days I used as a sick leave or or I left the office for 2 hours to talk to a doctor but no need - being the terrorized immigrant I am fearing to lose her permit, I was still working everyday one way or the other, even if I had a doctor’s note for that day. After an especially traumatizing meeting, I just couldn’t even stop crying let alone do anything else that I had to be hospitalized. I was going through a full blown mental breakdown. Not having slept for the past few weeks, and not being able to stop crying for the past few days, I was recently realizing the magnitude of the abuse I experienced and was strongly advised that I should immediately quit because my life was at stake (I was suicidal). Even then I wanted to somehow make it work.  So I had been minimizing what was happening and maximizing my endurance to tolerate those in my mind - but it was literally killing me. I think I’m glad in the end they kicked me out saying my performance was low; but the horror of building your entire life on your professional achievement and somebody thinking, after torturing you for months, that you are bad enough to be fired. 

By some miracle, I signed with another company which previously offered me a job on the same day. Sounds great doesn’t it? Indeed, this was awesome in many ways: I would still be permitted to stay here, I would have a regular income, my supervisors knew that I went through a full blown mental breakdown so they were very gentle with me. But I wasn’t and still am not myself. 

The first 6 months my vocabulary, speech and the structures I used to express myself had been awful. I was dissociated, would (still) have derealization and depersonalization episodes. I would forget every, single, thing, be it important or not, that happened just minutes ago. I wasn’t fit to be trusted with electronics like stoves or ovens because I wouldn’t remember turning them off. I would walk out of the bathroom leaving the tap running. I used to read a lot or game a lot - after the trauma I wouldn’t remember what I just read and I wouldn’t have the reflexes to play a game. And I wasn’t (and still am not) able to do anything which required a certain level of cognitive functioning, let alone learning new things. For example, I was able to code in certain programming languages, but I wouldn’t be able to remember, for the life of me, how to write a very basic script for one very trivial thing. This eventually went on for too long that I started to believe that I actually never was able to code in that language. Or that I had been an imposter all my life. Even my English wasn’t any good anymore. If I were to quit this job, I wouldn’t even be able to do the dishes in a restaurant or something because I simply don’t have the mental capacity for anything that is imaginable and that I can get paid for doing. I literally was (and am) reduced to “nothing and no one” in the end. You can guess that my current job isn’t going very well under these circumstances either.

It is especially hard when you are 30 something and so far you have built your personality on your mental capacity. If i were to define myself in the past, I would have said “I learn quickly, I work very hard, I am extremely organized”. Not “I am pretty” or “I am kind” or “I have a cause, I have a drive, I can cook-dance-sing well”. Just those three. And I don’t have any of them now. I can’t learn anything, or even remember the things I learned in the past. I can’t work hard because it feels like trying to fill a bucket with a big hole in the bottom. I can’t focus and when I do focus I just can’t get my brain to work. I’m now extremely disorganized because I cannot look after myself or my house - I just don’t have that energy, cannot even plan in my head what goes where. The biggest trouble is that everybody thinks that I’m stupid, well I am stupid, but this is a new information I cannot make peace with because other people’s respect for me had been my only reference point in life. And I’m starting to think that while my supervisors know what I’m going through they might also be suspecting that I’m just stupid regardless of my trauma.

Does it mean, for me to survive this (this time the most serious) suicidal phase, that I have to rebuild myself picking whatever is left? What if nothing is left? I know that I need therapy and medication - but I can’t afford neither of them. I have absolutely zero friends in this country which has deeply rooted racism issues and I’m what you might call a “lesser European” so I do get racist jokes about me from my colleagues etc. I know I will have to get out of this mental state, but I have nothing left to hold onto or to build upon. And I keep wondering if I will have to settle with being a stay-at-home pet mother because I will never get out of this mental fog and that my brain tissues have shrunk just too much to make a come back from.

Says she doesn’t have the mental capacity to do anything but writes for pages and pages... I’m sorry I tried to shorten this but I guess it’s the fact that I never told anyone about it that I cannot cut off more. All this lengthy sob story to ask: is there anyone who made it out alive from a place like this? Have you regained your mental strength? Have you become employable again? Are there good people out there who would understand what it means to have a PTSD and would hold your hand while you remember how you did your job before? Or am I doomed to a life of doing absolutely nothing if I manage to not kill myself? 

I really don’t know what to do, where to find support and how to fix myself.",Speirena,2019-03-18 06:25:38,15,1756,25.6,11.27,90.19,14.07,21.68,16,93.28,62.13,19.7,12.81,10.54,0.06,1.48,0.23,0.51,6.89,5.3,12.7,12.07,5.98,6.95,3.42,20.16,5.01,1.71,1.88,1.14,2.05,5.69,2.39,3.25,0.57,0.68,0.8,5.58,0.17,0.11,0.17,0.17,15.38,2.33,1.77,2.16,3.76,2.16,5.24,1.54,0.34,0.57,0.4,2.11,0.46,1.25,0.06,0.28,6.15,0.57,2.11,1.71,1.14,0.85,6.32,10.93,1.2,13.04,1.88,5.98,5.64,3.42,0.97,0.51,0.46,0.17,0.28,0.68,0.06,0.17,0.28,0.17,0,13.27,3.99,3.13,0.23,0.17,0.74,0,0.97,0.8,2.45,0.68,0.11

I left my abuser’s how about 11 years ago mid- March.  I am on Prozac and have therapy monthly. Yesterday I was taking a bath and was overwhelmed with intrusive thoughts of drowning myself. It scared me so bad I ended up crying in bed for a hour until my husband came home (i texted him immediately for him to come home) and feeling so emotionally drained for the rest of the day. I was just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this and what helped them not have intrusive thoughts like these.  If you need anymore info let me know!!

b2mykv,Help,"I don’t really want to go into too much detail, because it’s rough. But I was sexually assaulted by a male doctor while in the ER for a rape kit back when I was 18.

 I have a gynaecologist appointment next Wednesday, which I’m already anxious about. I requested a female doctor so that’s somewhat comforting. But I really don’t know what to do besides flake &amp; wait another 3 years for an examination to be done... or potentially laugh hysterically while being examined. This has actually been a problem for a while - I laugh until I finally break down and cry because I am so uncomfortably sad and overwhelmed.

b2qj3r,You were all so kind and helpful in my last post. I have one last request: I want to talk about the nightmares.,"It's very hard to find information on nightmares because there are so many different kinds, stemming from different things from the subconscious of many different people. Most of the results are ""dream interpretation"" sites which, I would be cool with even reading if I could find what plagues me on them.

Tell me about your nightmares. Is there a general theme? Continuous characters? Do you know the people? How often do you dream of your abuser if you have one? Are the dreams recurring? Are they specifically dreams of past traumatic events or variations on them? Has your therapist given you any insight on them?

I want to hear all of it. It makes me feel very alone sometimes.

You don't have to read this part, you can just answer, but this is what I want to share about my own nightmares:

My trauma stems from my childhood with my mother, and her various shitty boyfriends and ex husbands. She is prevalent in a lot of my dreams and nightmares, even though I haven't had contact with her in over 3 years now (not though her lack of trying). It's generally mundane and just frustrating, every day stuff with the dreams of her (arguments and etc). Only once have I had a nightmare I can remember that was of an actual previous event where she strangled me.

My other nightmares, the more regular ones, are way worse and I have no idea where they come from. I have at least one a week, sometimes more, never less. They are always extremely vivid and I routinely will wake up having a panic attack.

It's a dream where I'm being chased and/or hunted. Sometimes by people in masks, sometimes in a weird alien apocalypse setting, sometimes other horrifying looking creatures I'd draw if I was any good at it. It's mostly people though.

These dreams almost never contain people I know, no houses or places I'm familiar with. I am always somewhere I don't know, with people I may know only in the dream. I watch a lot of them die in front of me in extremely brutal fashions while I'm hidden somewhere not doing anything to help them, just being terrified.

The fact that all of the dreams I have like this are different but have the same overarching theme just make me really curious, but also confused. I have no idea where any of this is coming from. What does this mean? Does anyone have similar themes in their nightmares? 

Let's just chat about them please so I feel less insane.",and_iran,2019-03-18 17:38:16,7,455,18.26,38.74,78.4,1,14.22,15.16,93.41,59.78,20.22,14.29,8.35,0.22,2.2,1.32,2.2,5.49,4.4,11.65,11.87,9.23,6.15,2.2,17.36,5.71,3.3,1.98,1.1,4.18,6.15,1.32,4.84,0.66,1.32,0.22,10.55,0.44,0.44,1.54,0.44,18.68,3.74,1.1,1.98,6.15,2.64,5.05,1.98,0.88,0.22,0.88,0.66,0.44,0.22,0,0,3.3,1.54,0.22,1.1,0.22,0.44,1.98,14.29,0.66,11.87,0.44,6.15,5.05,0.22,2.42,0.22,0,0,0.44,0.66,0.22,0,0.22,0,0,15.38,5.05,3.74,0.44,0,1.98,0,0,0.44,2.64,0.88,0.22

b2ri2u,Last night,"It's raining. The attackers surround me. I'm not sure how many. Everytime I look there seems to be more.

They rush towards me. I fight them off at first but it's not long before I'm overpowered. They force me to the ground, punching me, kicking me. I'm not sure if I see the knife but I feel it. It stabs into my side. I'm going to die here. I thrash my body wildly, trying to escape, trying to survive. Suddenly an opening. My right leg is free. It has a clear path to an attackers head. This is my best and only chance. I kick with all my strength. I scream with rage.


My leg impacts something hard. It's dark. Where am I? My leg! Is it broken? I scream with pain.


Wait, I'm in a bed. My daughter's room! She was sick. I was cuddling her to help her go to sleep. Where is she?! It's too dark I can't see her! Did I just kick my daughter with all my strength? No no no no no! Fuck! Where is she?!

I scream with terror.


My wife runs in. ""What happened? Is she ok? She's shaking. Stop screaming.""

She's alive. Is she ok? I hold her. She's scared out of her wits but she isn't hurt. My leg! It hurts so bad. I think something is broken. I must have kicked a wall or some furniture.

""I don't think you should sleep near her anymore""

I sob with sadness.

b2ru0h,Has your taste in music changed? What did you listen to before and after?,"I know this is probably a weird question, but music has always had such an impact on my life and I know I’m not the only one. With one of my traumas, it happened during a concert weekend. Another involves a guy who has friends as a band and I went to a show with him and his girlfriend. Yet another is just music as memories and feelings.


Before my first ptsd trauma, I was listening to country, upbeat reggae, and electronic music. Now, none is that feels right. It’s not as fun, or it doesn’t say how I feel anymore. I started listening to my collection of punk music and that brought back youthful memories, but now I’m processing those through traumatized eyes. The same is happening with my alt rock/rock collection. It’s just not hitting the spot. Nothing is. It’s like I’m now living a part of my life that music can’t help, and that’s terrifying because it’s always been there, even when no one else is.


I know there’s probably a part which has to do with traumatic events involving music making me probably subconsciously not wanting to be close to it anymore, or something, but if that’s the case, how do you take back hobbies that ptsd stole?

b2syr6,Having a hard time with partner's parents,"Hi everyone. I'm having a tough week and wanted to reach out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was diagnosed with PTSD just over a year ago, resulting from an abusive long-term relationship that ended in 2012. I've come really far in my healing process, but lately I'm struggling. 

&amp;#x200B;

The abusive boyfriend's parents were also abusive toward me. Now I'm in a healthy relationship, and I get along great with my partner's parents. But they'd always lived out-of-state before, and I knew ahead of time when I'd see them and for how long. Now that they've moved close to us, I am massively triggered if they drop by unexpectedly, or even with a few hours notice. I end up running to hide in the bedroom before they even show up. My heart races, I get angry, and I just freeze up for hours. And even though I know it's trigger stuff, I don't feel like I can just stop it. 

&amp;#x200B;

No one but my boyfriend sees any of this, and I tell him it's PTSD and not me hating his family. I don't ask him to cancel or anything, but I feel like it makes me look like a selfish jerk that I can't just go with the flow. 

&amp;#x200B;

And all of this just makes me so PISSED at my abuser but that's a whole other story. 

&amp;#x200B;

b2tqsz,I am a college student and I think I have PTSD after a police raid in my apartment. Help,"Long story, but read if you can. 

I came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. 

About a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. 

Lots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. 

The day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. 

I woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear ""COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said ""one sec"" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. 

During this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. 

The main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.

I explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. 

After the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. 

I showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. 

Since I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. 

It got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. 

Do I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. 

I miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself. I feel like who i used to be is lost and i am afraid of spiraling into something worse. I have talked to her and she has been there for me through this situation and is being cautious of my emotions and feelings too to help in any way she can. She has experience with anciety and depression and I think she wants me to maybe seel out help. I am going to speak to her about it when we see each other again. She goes to my school too and I see her often. 

anything will help.",Pinocho_2010,2019-03-18 23:09:26,2,1080,50.6,27.37,97.83,10.55,17.14,13.61,93.06,59.44,19.17,15.56,11.57,0.83,0.19,1.48,1.48,3.61,4.72,16.11,7.87,4.44,8.52,1.57,18.24,3.52,2.5,1.2,1.02,1.67,3.52,1.11,2.31,0.46,0.56,0.65,8.61,0,1.11,0.74,0.83,9.44,2.31,1.11,1.11,2.59,1.11,2.31,4.17,1.3,1.67,1.11,1.67,0.65,0.74,0.09,0.09,6.76,2.5,0.65,2.5,1.48,0.65,8.98,7.22,1.2,19.54,3.24,9.35,6.94,2.96,1.02,3.52,0.37,0.09,0,0.46,0.19,0,0.19,0.09,0,9.63,5.37,2.78,0,0,0.19,0.56,0.19,0.28,0,0.19,0.09

My fiance is a navy vet and every now and then something triggers him and he gets really bad night terrors ( screaming,trashing etc.) 

Does anyone have any tips on how i can make it easier for him when he gets one?

I read that you shouldn't try to wake a person that's having a night terror and that it's extremely hard to do so.
He's usually unresponsive during the episode and they last anywhere from a couple of seconds to a few minutes.
Some he remembers, most he doesn't.

I'm just trying to find something that would make it easier for him.

b2yqqv,I’m reopening a wound that has never healed.,"Thank you to this sub for existing. I’m in the beginning steps of legally pursuing my abuser from ages 14 to 17. I wrote something that explains pretty accurately how I’m feeling right now. “I’m reopening a wound that has never healed”. I didn’t allow myself to think about the trauma for the past 4 years because I couldn’t function if I thought about it. Now here I am finally angry enough about the suffering I’ve experienced and the lack of consequences for my abuser that I’m ready to hold him accountable. And in only the 3 days since I spoke to a lawyer and had to recount the abuse I’ve cried myself to sleep every night and have had flashbacks that I never allowed myself to learn to cope with. All these thoughts about the abuse have piled up and now that my gate is down, they’re all flooding back in. I’m struggling with it so much but I came to this sub and reading everyone’s experience has helped me come to terms with the fact I have PTSD. When I was first diagnosed over a year ago I shrugged it off thinking of people who have survived so much worse than me. But now that I’m not shutting my feelings down, I’m realizing just how bad it’s gotten. I read symptoms and stories on this sub last night and cried over how much I understood those symptoms and feelings. But as much as it hurt, I was relieved to hear others understood how I’ve been feeling (also not relieved because these feelings suck and I would never wish these feelings upon anyone).

b2zb1i,Any ideas on how to keep my PTSD from ruining my(27F) marriage with my (28M) partner?,"I have began to notice that over the years, whenever my partner or (ANYONE) shows signs of intense anger or frustration....something in my head \*clicks\* and it isn't a good thing. I can go from OK to FLIPPING OUT mode as my mind begins to spiral. Here is an example:

I wake up and my patner is sitting by the bed, looking HOPELESSLY DEJECTED.

I ask whats wrong and he tells me he knocked over the water pipe onto himself and most of that last of the cannabis.

My brain clicks as I stare at him moping.

I start to feel nervous, agitated, upset, angry...but also sympathetic.

I ask him if he is ok? He answers YES in a frustrated way and He stares at the ground and continues to feel sorry for himself. It is clear he is just upset and I should leave him alone, but I can't get over it because I am triggered.

I tell him that it is going to be ok, and that at least he has some cannabis left (I gave up my bit so he could have it all)

He says: ""No, most of it is gone....""

As he speaks, horrible emotions surface in me. (Hopelessness, fear, anger, resentment, irritability) It all feels unassociated from the current situation.

(After 15 more minutes of this dejected attitude that is steadily driving me insane):

I tell him in a calm/upset way that he needs to essentially ""stop being so dramatic/get over it"" because he is acting like someone died and it is interally freaking me out for some reason.

He then gets more upset because he says that is rude and I am not understanding his POV, his emotions and that he always helps me when I am upset.

My mental health sunshine level went from SUNNY DAY...to THUNDERSTORM.

I seriously was concidering his emotions, its just that mine had suddenly bombarded me in a way that felt uncontrollable.

I cried for 30 mins, put myself down for being a piece of shit who can't even comfort their partner without feeling like something horrible just happened to them. I felt like I want to run away from my partner, or myself and I even have an urge to hit myself. A lot of feelings that I don't usually feel are felt and I eventually calm myself down with some meditating music.

I can't have a healthy marriage or realationships if I keep reacting like this. Any ideas?

b2zs5e,"The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel A. van der Kolk - anyone read it?","So, I just recently began therapy.  
I'm 43 now and I've been reaching out for help since I was in my late 20's. Generally, the ""help"" that's on offer isn't helpful at all. From a regular MD to Clinical psychologists, to most therapists. My experience thus far has been that, unless you're some kind of psychologist yourself, you're fucked.   
It's been almost 20 years of seeking help (not having a clue what was wrong with me along the way). Either the terror was so bad, or the hurt was so bad or the need to die was so bad, that I was always, passively, advocating for myself. Reading everything and anything that suggested &gt;&gt; inner peace this way.  
For the most part, I hate the medical profession. From psychiatry to clinicians to MD's. In regards to PTSD, that is. My heart goes out to all the misdiagnoses.......oh my god, the misdiagnoses.... 

So, my wife  found me this counsellor that might have a clue about a thing or two. I think she found him because we stopped taking the referral method - one doctor refers you to another refers you to another etc She opted to go a private method instead. Like, we might pay real money to take care of this shit.  
In my second session I suggested I have (not accurate) a proclivity for reading and he suggested I might read ""The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel A. van der Kolk"".  
Sunday will be my 3rd appointment and I've got the book and I'm trying to digest it as fast as I can.

Yesterday I saw a few bugs in my apartment, and afterwards kept feeling bugs crawling on me. I was so on edge that I had two panic attacks, one of which was caused by a tiny fly landing on my hand and startling me! Last night in the middle of a bad episode, I figured out why this is happening. I’m having bad emotional flashbacks and thoughts about my past pregnancies because both happened at this time of year. This morning I was so out of it, I took the train the wrong direction.

At 18, I was in a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship. I got pregnant, but ended up having a miscarriage. The bleeding lasted two weeks, and it was insanely painful and scary. In the aftermath, I learned that my abuser had a second girlfriend who he had also gotten pregnant. It was a terrible betrayal that I was in denial about for months. Because in my eyes, we had gone through the miscarriage together and he had helped me through it all. Even though we broke up during the fallout, I still believed his lies (no I wasn’t cheating) and sometimes slept with him after the breakup. I feel sick thinking about it.

Almost four years later, I found out I was pregnant again. Even though I was much better about my birth control after the past traumatic incident. I had been sexually assaulted shortly before, by my roommate’s friend who was visiting us. We went out as a group, he waited until I was intoxicated and out of eyesight of my roommates to pressure me into a taxi to my apartment for sex. I am a repeat sexual assault survivor, so I complied at the time. After the assault, he was in my bed and kept pressuring me for more sex, which I repeatedly and firmly refused. He said “do you want me to wake you up by fucking you?”. I was insanely creeped out, but my roommates returned to save the day. His friend/my roommate lured him out of my room to smoke. My other roommate texted me to let me know this guy had a PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND BACK HOME. I had been forced to be on the opposite side of the awful cheating I’d endured during my first pregnancy. I felt sick and used. I had a consensual partner around the same time, and until my appointment I had no way of knowing who had gotten me pregnant. It turned out to be the consensual partner, thank god. But I still had to go through a scary abortion. The whole experience was hell, especially because I was trying to meet my graduation requirements. I found out about this pregnancy almost exactly four years ago.

I was sexually and emotionally abused by multiple family members on both sides of the family, and I was sexually assaulted by my father. All this happened before the age of 6. The memories have only begun resurfacing recently (the last 3 years). I have a difficult time with my symptoms, especially when it comes to connecting with others. I find I feel the safest isolating myself from everyone and cannot enjoy the company of friends anymore. But even though isolating feels safest, I still feel lonely, I still want friends, but I find that any relationship inevitably triggers me (feeling emotionally close and comfortable with another person reminds me too much of feeling emotionally comfortable and close with my abusers before they hurt me in atrocious ways).

Now, the conflict: I have certain family members who were not directly involved in the trauma (or at least they were not actively hurting me like my childhood abusers were) who would like a relationship with me (for instance, my grandparents, my father's parents, who are paying for me to have a place to live and provide financial aid whenever they can). I feel like I need to have a relationship back because they are paying for me to live and survive, but every time I'm around them or there is any contact between us, I feel really bad emotions. It's as if, due to all the traumas I experienced growing up dealt by family, my brain has made an association that family equates to danger. This makes sense, considering everything I went through as a young child. But now, as an adult, I feel the need to be able to form relationships again, but every time I feel close to anyone, it triggers flashbacks. I feel small, helpless, in danger, the need to escape. 

How do I deal with this? To ignore my emotional state, force myself to see them only causes more pain and suffering for me. But I feel bad that I can't feel comfortable being around them because they are paying for so many of my living expenses. And even though I'd rather be independent so I didn't have to rely on anyone, I'm too unstable to hold down a job right now. But then this just triggers suicidal feelings because it feels as if I can't take care of myself and have to rely on others that I can't feel safe with (which also reminds me of my childhood). I just spiral and I'm not sure how to handle or help this situation. I feel so guilty having to hurt my family members by being too uncomfortable to be around them, but likewise, I feel hurt my family could treat me so horribly as a child.

Can anyone relate? Any advice/suggestions would be appreciated. I'm just having a difficult time lately and am not sure what to do anymore.",theshadowsweare,2019-03-19 12:43:21,3,504,33.32,21.36,95.44,3.31,21,19.25,94.05,58.73,18.85,13.1,11.11,0.2,0,0,1.79,5.75,4.76,13.89,8.53,7.34,9.13,1.79,15.48,4.56,2.78,1.98,0.6,2.98,8.53,2.98,5.36,0.6,0.79,1.79,10.32,2.38,0.6,0,0.6,18.25,4.76,2.78,1.98,2.18,2.58,5.56,4.96,0.2,0,4.37,1.59,0.2,0.99,0.4,0,9.13,4.37,0.6,1.98,0.2,2.18,1.79,12.7,0.2,11.71,0.99,4.76,6.15,1.39,1.59,1.59,0.99,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.08,4.17,5.36,0.2,0,0.6,0,0,0,2.18,2.38,0.2

b33mvb,Concurrence with BPD,"Hey guys,


I was just diagnosed with PTSD after seeking treatment for what I thought was BPD. The symptoms of complex PTSD certainly overlap with the symptoms of BPD, but there are some things I've been experiencing that a PTSD diagnosis doesn't exactly explain.

b38fs6,Sent this to a friend who didn’t believe me about my ptsd,"Hey so I was thinking about our conversation about our PTSD and I realized, all my life since ____  kissed me, people have been downplaying what I’ve been through.

My flashbacks haven’t been as intense since taking my medications, but the paranoia is still there. I feel very threatened when I am around men now.

Plus, my relationship with my mom hasn’t been strong in the sense that I feel like she is always peering over my shoulder, and for good reasons. For instance, she read my diary when I was 14 and she found out other things about my personal life that led me to blaming myself and feeling guilty. when I was really young, I was exposed to things that gave me the impression that men sexualized women and it has made it difficult for me to trust men.

b38hi7,The straw that broke the camel's back...,"This is really stupid.  But I'm told I'm supposed to talk about shame, they say ptsd is like rooted in shame, right?  So yeah.  I have been on the ropes with doctors for a bit now, I'm pretty wracked up, trouble eating food, haven't left my mouse-infested house in like 4 days.

I have been listening to this comedian's podcasts, he doesn't have a huge following but the same style of humor and he's been through worse GI stuff than I and survived.  So I, in my desperation for help with all this, send him a DM on Twitter.  I couldn't find an email, that would've probably been better but I don't use social media really, I don't understand a lot of the social graces with it, like my preferred form of communication is a phone call, so I figured a DM would be okay.  Ugh.   
 Yeah, so I sent a message that in hindsight was cringingly long, expressed my gratitude for him being brave enough to talk about this stuff openly and publicly, and asked if he had any advice.  He then tweeted a bit ago just a facepalm.  I have nothing but regret now.

I don't know why this is eating me alive, I never used to give a shit about this.  I have all my embarrassing shit on here from ages ago that I never deleted.  I am trying to make a point to not delete the DM, I didn't even know you could do that now but it seems kinda stupid.  My anxiety is through the roof, it's unrelenting and shifting from one topic to another, infesting other little fears and inflating them up like molten beach balls.  It's so fucking stupid!  I think it's just a culmination of a lifetime of rejection from pretty much everyone, it's brutal.  I am just desperately looking for someone who cares enough to help me get a fresh start, even in the smallest ways.  Even just hang out and check on me every couple days.  At very least, I just want to stop being such a bother to other people.  I talk a lot, I have a fucking lot to say.  I'm 100% honest, which apparently means ""hostile"" to even my own family.  I'm starting to stand up for myself and set boundaries and, once again, ""hostile"" and ""angry"".  Then I shut up and go quiet because I'm told I talk too much or I'm being difficult, as always, that song and dance.  Then shit gets awkward, they don't reach out because ""I'm supposed to"" or something, weeks go by, I open my whole non-existent schedule for them, I'm free whenever, but won't reach out myself because they're busy all the time or buried in their own shit and I don't want to seem needy.  It's such a paradox.

The big kicker on all of this - everyone, all of it, family, friends, doctors, 'counselors' - they're 100% convincing me that I'm crazy.  They did this before with epilepsy and I went with them.  They did this with Lyme Disease (jury's still out on this one), faced my mortality on that, I went with them.  I'm going crazy thinking I'm going crazy.  But I'm taking my meds, I'm tapering off Ativan which is probably why I'm this extra anxious and I'm just noticing that that is likely why I'm freaking out.  But hell I'll just leave that, if for nothing else than comedic relief.  It's all rooted in deep truth, I've been screaming for help for so long I don't feel like I have a voice anymore.  I lost a friend 6 months ago to a likely intentional overdose, he was going through the same shit, this community has completely rejected my pleas for help and it's putting a lot of lives at risk.  It's getting really bad up here, seriously.

So I guess what I'm going full circle on here, what this letter on the pile is kinda about, is maybe it was just a cry for attention.  Yes, a cry for attention.  Let's get to brass fucking tacks here.  Most of my generation and the generations following us were raised in a society with a dependency on attention.  It has been bred into us and it is NOT a bad thing.  Talk to ANYONE who has gone more than 3 days without seeing another person.  It's like starvation, eerily similar to starvation.  Why do people condemn this?  ""Oh, they're just looking for attention"" - attention is literally having a 5 minute conversation with that person and giving a shit.  If anything, they should be saying ""Oh, they're only looking for attention, that's pretty easy""  It feels so juvenile and toxic.  They're not being trolls, who want the same thing and GET it.  It seems more civil to moderate social interaction, not cut it off entirely and snub people just because they're hurting.  A need for attention can be seen as a call to FORM community as easily as it can be seen as a burden on existing society.

People like me have a LOT to offer and no idea where to put it or how.  We have failed, we have been betrayed, we have experienced ruin, we've been chewed up and spit out.  But we're not giving up.  We just need a community that wants what we have to offer, that gives us a place and is willing to give us a chance.  Maybe it's just me.  I feel like I'm just eternally waiting for a phone call and I just haven't gotten the hint yet that it's not coming.  Soul-crushing.

It's just hard to keep your head above water and really feel like you'll accomplish anything if you're constantly reaffirmed that you're not worth the effort, you're crazy, you're a drain on resources and a parasite in the family and community - and not just reading in to things, volumes of hard facts - when do you just give up the fight?  I've already submitted myself to every psych med, epilepsy med, anxiety med, depression med, mood stabilizer, at least half a dozen therapists.  There's no one left.  My ""counselor"", who has a degree in Buddhist something that he's been pushing on me, has watched me spiral from entering an extremely toxic, abusive relationship alllll the way down to rock bottom.  He recommended I go to a psych retreat after I found out two of my friends died, one I said earlier, the other was murdered several years ago and no one ever told me.  Life of an exile.  My counselor offered no follow up treatment, no referral to specialists, he doesn't even have a treatment plan with me.  So I stopped going.  I'm pretty much out of resources and I'm kinda forced to move, which actually bodes well for my health getting out of this horrible haunted house of a town and also this actual haunted damn house.  Getting to the point where I might need a priest here.  O.O

She acted innocent, like she never knew, even tho i called the bank and they said she had paper where I consent this in 2014.... which never happend! false paper and signature... 

I got further more emotional and told her how cold hearted she is, how she abused us siblings...
Guess what, she claims to not remember shit and telling me how awfull I am to be so mean to her... 

I never win, she always know how to make me feel awfull even though she has both physical and emotionally abused me. She fucking broke my leg and don’t «remember that»  She kicked me so hard... 


I just can’t right now. I tried to tell her to back off and that I know her way to manipulate me... But... I keep getting manipulates because now she is so «concerd» want to undestand my ptsd or what not. 


No, mom. You can’t help.. I need space and just time away from you. I don’t trust you at all... Im not gonna feel like the emotional dramatic person who is just too much... Because you teached me this mom.. I don’t handle when people care for me.. I always thinks there is something behind it.

b39cvc,I can’t be a supportive friend (TW: SA),"A friend of mine recently had sex for the first time and I can tell she wants to talk about it with me. My anxiety is keeping me in a constant state of being too busy or distracted to give her the chance. The topic of virginity and first times makes me feel sick and panicky because I was sexually assaulted at a young age during the prime time of sex education in school.  So I remember learning about the concept of virginity and connecting the dots in class that what happened to me wasn’t okay and this whole ‘virginity’ thing was something, by textbook definition, I no longer had. I feel like it was stolen from me. 
So when it gets brought up by friends who go into detail about ‘loosing’ theirs I start to panic. It all comes flooding back to my head. It makes me want to run. 
I want to be there for her. But I physically shut down. I feel like a terrible friend. What can I do?

I don’t have any friends anymore because I pushed everybody away, I can’t trust anybody new, I can’t be a normal person in a relationship. I struggle with if I was this awful before my trauma or did it make me into the fuckin shell of a person I am today? 
I’m mad because I lash out at anybody trying to care, while also being mad because their trying is so minimal effort. Like how hard is it to just listen to me without telling me about a friend who was raped and whose fucking life is still in shambles 20 years later? How is it so hard to do a little research or ask me about it instead of taking it personally? 
The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because my moms brother did last year. And I got real close to just doing it two weeks ago, but didn’t because I was watching my coworkers puppy and didn’t want her to be upset that her puppy ate part of my dead body or something. 
I can’t afford therapy, I cant handle drinking or doing drugs.. all I do is try to get outside of myself as much as I possibly can and even then it’s still unbearable

b3dt3t,Loss of interest in everything.,"Anyone else experiencing this? 

I’ve finally gotten help for my PTSD and while I feel positive it will actually help me, I’m struggling to function. I work 8-5 and I’m exhausted from dealing with insomnia most nights. When I don’t have insomnia and actually sleep, I’m left with a loss of interest in all aspects of my job. I go to work, struggle to do any actual work, go home, eat, and lay on the couch or in bed because I’m too exhausted to do anything else. My husband does all of the house work and it makes me feel so guilty. I have no interest in doing anything else and don’t care much about anything. 

My boss knows of my ptsd and insomnia and is so supportive, which I’m extremely grateful for. But I feel this life isn’t for me. I hate working 8-5 especially when I’m dealing with mental health issues and little sleep. I fantasize about quitting my job all the time. My husband works from home, which I wish I could do but can’t in my current position, so we could try to survive on one salary but it may be hard. We just moved into a new apartment and the rent is a little high for one salary, so I feel obligated to work full time. Does anyone else feel like this?

He explained calmly and softly that yes, I used to have panic attacks, go unconscious, have convulsions. He said I was sad 80% of the time.

I have to have visitation with him and get texts from him almost everyday, causing me major anxiety. Honestly, the verbal abuse has never stopped, as he still screams at me over the phone or in public for something stupid.

But I digress. Because of all the moving around I did at a young age, my social skills were in the gutter when I was 13 and finally back with my mom. Even though I was in a safe environment now, I was still doing my ""chameleon"" defense mechanism. It's basically where I would stay quiet the first day of school, observe, and then the next day just copy what I'd observed the previous day. I know it sounds bad, but it's what I did to have temporary friends in the new schools I went to. But trying to use this tactic long-term went sour pretty quick, causing me to be friendless most of high school. It's only been this year where I've been able to be confident in myself around others enough to have my own personality. Yeah, for most of high school I was devoid of a personality, as I'd killed it to try and be likable. 

My inability to have a good social life has also led me to be completely inept when it comes to the opposite sex. I've had many boys that I've liked, but I always feel so horrible for even considering that they may like me back. This has led me to not be able to ask guys out or really flirt, as I don't feel I'm good enough, I guess. I feel like there's always someone prettier, nicer, and funnier than me and that they probably wouldn't want to be with me instead. I don't know how to shake this, and I want to SO BAD, as there's a guy I really like and am wanting to ask to go out with me.

 IDK what I'm looking for here, I guess advice, or just some kind words. It just feels nice to be able to talk in a community where there are other people who understand.

b3l9m0,Death,"This is the only time I haven’t posted here triggered probably.  I really want to die.  I have no positive family memories and I estranged myself but I know I’ll feel super guilty when they’re dead.  My grandparents are about to die.  My dog who loved me died three months ago.  I hadn’t seen him in five years.  He was 10.  Some girl lied and gave me genital herpes recently.  I met a girl I like but she’s using me.   I’m almost 30 and a loser.  I make a lot of money but everyone at work considers me the babbling engineer.  I pissed off a coworker unintentionally because he didn’t show up to a meeting and he went immediately to my boss and it was embarrassing.  They all lost a lot of faith in me.

I hurt a lot of people.  I have ruined my body.  I don’t want to deal with the consequences of my actions because I had no guidance or support my whole life.  I don’t feel responsible, yet I bear the burden.  I know others are less fortunate in life and society. 

I want to be dead.  I really don’t enjoy anything in life.  There is one single girl on the opposite side of the planet who likes me and that is it.  Pretty sure having herpes is a dealbreaker.  It would have been for me.

b3m4ui,How do I forgive my parents?,"This is my first time talking about my PTSD or asking for support on the internet, so please be gentle. 

I am recently dealing with a bad flare-up of my PTSD. Specifically, I am dealing with something I previously felt resolved about - forgiving my parents for not catching the signs surrounding my abuse when I was young. 

I was sexually abused by a close family friend from 6 to 13 years of age. During this time multiple people came to my parents and said they thought something might be off. Nothing concrete, no evidence, just ""this seems weird"". My parents generally dismissed these warnings.  

At age 13 I got really sick of trying to explain my depression without citing the actual cause and came forward about the abuse. At that point my parents were truly and extremely supportive. They believed me immediately, apologized profusely for their lapse in judgment, and helped me seek legal action and therapy. 

At the time I felt accepting of the fact that they had done their best and failed. I suppose in some ways I felt like I needed the stability of a non-combative relationship with my parents more than I needed to vent my anger. 

Recently, (over a decade later) after the birth of my own daughter, and due to some events which have re-triggered my PTSD, I have been revisiting my feelings around my parents a lot. For the first time in my life I am living completely without my parents logistical or financial support. It feels like the lack of dependence has freed up some space to feel truly angry at their failure to protect me. 

In many ways I know that this is a feeling that will pass. Right now I am struggling with how to interact with my parents. We normally have a very close relationship and speak several times a week Etc. Recently I find that I am avoiding contact. I have the urge to explain my lack of interaction, but it somehow feels like it would be destructive to bring it up again after so many years. I spent a long time trying to get my mom to stop beating herself up over this, so turning around and saying ""nevermind I'm pissed at you after all"" seems like it would be a cruel thing to do. 

Of course I will be discussing this with my therapist, but I thought I'd try crowdsourcing some support since the number of people I feel I can talk to about this in person is fairly limited. 

Thanks in advance for any words of kindness or gentle advice.",onlylostphysics,2019-03-20 21:17:52,10,444,65.05,31.82,96.9,25.77,18.5,19.82,91.89,55.63,18.47,13.51,11.49,0.23,0.23,0.23,1.35,4.95,4.95,16.89,7.66,5.63,4.5,1.13,17.34,4.28,3.15,0.9,1.13,2.7,7.66,3.83,3.83,0.45,1.8,0.68,9.91,2.7,0.45,0.68,0,15.54,5.18,1.13,1.58,4.73,1.8,2.25,2.7,0,0.68,2.03,1.58,0.23,1.13,0.23,0,10.59,3.6,2.48,3.15,0.9,2.03,4.28,10.36,0.68,15.09,1.58,6.53,7.43,1.35,0.23,0.23,0.45,0,0,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,0,10.81,5.18,2.7,0,0,0.23,0,0.9,0.9,0.45,0.45,0

b3mxve,how do I cope with the need to control my environment??????,"hi everybody, 

I’ve been lurking for quite a while but today my friend confronted me with something and I’m kinda concerned. I was diagnosed with ptsd due to a traumatic hospital stay I experienced and even though it’s already been a year i am just now understanding what that means for my daily life. recently my dissociation has been really bad - and I’ve realized it’s kicked up a lot of feelings about how I felt so out of control. because of this I have found that I often do small things to keep the environment around me in a particular order - and I like to do things in a certain way or I feel like I’m spiraling out of control. 

I did not think it was a big problem though until my friend strongly suggested that I might be too controlling for my own good and that apparently I have a “need to control literally everything” around me. ahaha now I’m crying alone in my house freaking out and feeling like such a douche bag for letting it affect my relationships and feel out of control of my ability to control my own control issues (if that makes sense ahah). am I alone in this? is it going to go away? why did her comment hurt me so bad? some coping skills or advice would be appreciated because I feel like I’m drowning teehee ¡",smallestfrye,2019-03-20 22:53:45,7,245,24.49,7.67,98.09,7.14,22.27,17.96,94.29,62.45,21.63,14.29,13.88,0,0,0.41,0,7.35,4.49,15.1,11.43,8.16,8.57,0.41,19.59,2.86,2.04,1.63,0,0.82,6.94,2.45,4.08,0,0.41,1.63,4.08,0,0.82,0.41,0,21.22,5.71,6.12,2.04,4.49,1.22,3.27,3.67,0,0,2.86,1.22,0,1.22,0,0,9.39,1.63,0.82,5.31,0.41,1.22,4.9,13.47,0.82,13.06,1.22,7.35,4.49,0.41,0,0.41,0,0,0.41,1.63,0.82,0.82,0,0,0,12.65,2.45,0.41,0,0,3.67,0.41,0.82,0.82,3.27,0.82,0

b3r8in,PTSD from boyfriend of 5 years almost dying...,"It’s kind of hard for me to find anyone to talk to besides my therapist about this, because I don’t know if it’s the same feelings as when someone goes through this and their loved one actually does pass. 

A brief summary of what happened: The day after Thanksgiving I ended up convincing my boyfriend to go to the urgent care for a pain in his side that he’d been feeling for a few weeks but had gotten to the point where he was having pain with every breath he took. We went to urgent care and when we got in the room and the nurse and doctor came in, they basically all panicked and called for him to go in an ambulance to the hospital. We went to the ER and he had a CT scan and was diagnosed with a double pulmonary embolism at age 24 and the doctors said if he hadn’t come in he could have died within the next few days. He ended up being in the hospital for a week and was on blood thinners (still is) and had 3 surgeries to remove the clots, put in a stent, and put in a filter. He recovered really well and is almost back to normal. He’s not able to workout because he’s still on blood thinners, but his lungs are okay now. 

I was at the hospital the whole time. Experiencing the trauma of watching my strong, able-bodied man become so sick and weak really scared me. I really thought he might die at some points, because of some possibility of internal bleeding and him possibly not being able to breathe on his own during the surgeries. This is the man I want to marry, and who I want my future to be with, and the idea of him being so fragile really shook me. Normally I am the fragile one.

I feel so guilty for beings so emotional and distraught when he actually did live and is relatively fine now. I didn’t really allow myself to cry except for one night when I went home for a bit to see my family. Now I find myself crying hysterically when I just think about how much I love him... I feel like I should be happy now because he’s okay, but this is worse than when he was actually in the hospital. It’s almost like my love for him triggers my trauma, which makes me feel sick...

Not to mention I ended up having some of my own physical and anxiety responses at the same time as all these feelings surfacing. It’s just so much to deal with all at once and I just feel so alone like no one else can understand what I’m going through.",madijeanne3,2019-03-21 07:33:53,19,470,47.85,39.09,66.86,8.16,23.5,12.98,95.11,61.06,15.96,12.55,6.81,0.64,0,4.68,0.43,3.4,6.6,16.17,9.15,8.51,9.36,1.49,18.51,4.89,2.13,2.55,1.91,2.98,6.17,2.34,3.83,1.28,0,0.64,9.15,0.43,0.43,0,5.53,14.47,3.62,1.91,1.7,2.98,0.85,4.26,3.62,0.64,0.21,2.55,6.17,1.49,4.26,0,0,5.74,2.13,0.85,1.91,0.64,0.21,5.74,10.64,0.64,15.32,3.19,5.96,6.6,0.43,0.43,0.64,0,0,0.64,0.85,0,0,0.43,0.43,0,11.28,5.53,2.34,0.21,0,0,0,0.21,0,2.55,0.43,0

b3tfyb,"Datemate dissociates after PTSD, how do I help? Lots of triggers.","TW: CSA, abuse from family, eating disorders, flashbacks

My lovely datemate ""Laz"" is the love of my life.  I would die for them if only one of us were allowed to live.

Laz had a very traumatic childhood - multiple CSA incidents, a toxic family (including an older brother that attempted to kill them multiple times), dysphoria, eating disorders... my datemate didn't deserve this.

Lately they've been having more and more flashbacks as they have to talk to their toxic parents to get their birth certificate, Social Security info, FAFSA information, etc.

As we're getting more and more serious, we're noticing that Laz is dissociating after these meetings and reliving memories of the traumas endured while living with them.

We suspect an emotional detachment disorder compounded with PTSD.  We don't have the money for therapy right now, and I don't know how to help the love of my life.

In a quote from Laz:

""I read the steps I need to take in order to feel again, but I don't know what I can do.  My brain wants to feel, but it doesn't want to feel unless it's pain, anger, or joy - but at this point, even those emotions feel like they're shutting down.""

They've been to the free counseling provided by their university, but they emotionally shut down during the recounting of the trauma, and this bothers them.  They're convinced that if they can connect their emotions with the incident, they can heal better.

b3tsrw,I made a stupid mistake,"Last week I had a pretty terrible therapy session. I posted about it on here but in short, my therapist tried to refer me elsewhere and I took it really badly. The sessions ended with both of us feeling pretty heavy and unsure of what was going to happen. I left the session incredibly emotional and frustrated. I went home and took a bunch of pills (don’t judge me, I have terrible coping mechanisms) and found my therapists public Instagram account. I was wasted and I followed the account. I then passed out and completely forgot about what I did until last night. I searched the account so I could unfollow it to realise he had blocked me, obviously for good reason as I never should have followed him to begin with. I feel like a complete idiot and I really want to cancel our re-do session in a couple of days to save myself the embarrassment. My partner is a psychologist and I’m almost a nurse.

Digging through this sub to see if there's any help I can find here, but any advice you can give right off the bat?","I started seeing multiple psychologists and have been struggling with chronic PTSD, alcohol dependency, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. My psychs want to get me completely sober before I can start looking in to other treatment options (which is understandable) but I keep going on binges in between these long waits between doctors visits. It's ruining everything in my life, my job, my relationship with my girlfriend and family, and after two experiments with suicide, I'm starting to feel like these psychologists aren't really helping me at all.

b3x95u,It's been ten years.,"Trigger warning if mentions or talk about sexual abuse make you uncomfortable!!

It has now been 10 years since my trauma happened. When my therapist asks me what happened I can tell her about the day, the layout of the apartment, the time I woke up and the time my dad came to pick me up from my friends house, but I can't bring myself to tell her what happened in between. She knows what happened but she says talking it through is going to help me learn to deal with it. She also says I turn all my emotions into rage until it consumes me and I can see nothing but red, she says I'm angry, and shes right. Damn right I'm angry, I was eight years old and he was horny, I was a kid and he was my friends dad, he had a daughter my age and not once did he stop and think ""how would I feel if this had happened to my child"". That sad excuse of a man took my childhood and my innocence and replaced it with unhealthy coping mechanisms, doctors appointments for psychosomatic stomach pains that no one could diagnose for years, he fucked me up so bad I was scared to even be in the same room with my dad who had never done anything but love and care for me because my 8 year old brain though all that men around me wanted was to hurt and use me. So yeah, I'm angry.

And I'm so sorry if anyone reading this has had to go through anything similar, I know the pain and I know how hard it is, and I also know you are so tough and a force to be reckoned with to have survived it.

b3z36k,(NSFW) I have successfully intended sex with my BF for the first time and it was heavenly!,"I have been physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually abused from the age of 8 to 16. 7 months ago I met the most amazing man online. I'm 21 and he's 25. He's very understanding of my situation and he's been very gentle with me. We've had sex around our first month anniversary and it was quite nice even though it was hard for me. Up until that point I had been a virgin apart from the abuse and he was a virgin too so it was fairly awkward but very chill. Since then we've had sex quite a few times a week and it's nice, but he's always the one that has to ""start"" it. Like, if he's in the mood and we start kissing and touching 99,99% of the time I go along and love it and we end up having sex. Sometimes I want to try to start it, starting my kissing him, but then I don't know how to let him know that I want more. I get super shy and if he doesn't make the next move I'll just agree with not going further than that. He moved in with me on new year's Day and we have only grown stronger since then. He's kind of shy about it too, afraid I don't want to have sex when he wants too. So yesterday I asked if we should brush our teeth and go to sleep and he softly muttered that he hoped we could be ""sexy"" and then we'd have to go to the bathroom anyway.. I agreed happily. And I kind of took it as a learning moment. This night I decided to take my chance when we'd go to prepare for bed. I know he loved it when I gently touch him, just softly moving my hands over his back and arms and stomach. And then I grabbed his ass, which he thought I was just joking about until I started to massage it a bit more. He was turned on within a second and I playfully just let my fingers slide over his bulge. I slowly undressed him, knowing very well that he was really tired, so I told him that he could ask me to do anything he wanted me to do and I'd do it. Him being shy blushed and said I'm all his. That gave me some more confidence. So I decided to ride him if he had the energy. And he did have that. He comes rather quickly normally (he always goes on until  i finish too though) but now we went really really really slowly this time, making me actually orgasm twice! 

I am absolutely exhausted but it's time to sleep anyway. I feel so proud of myself for daring to do this. Usually I'd never admit that I'm turned on or whatever, but I trust him and he trusts me and together we are gonna be okay. I wish I had taken action sooner, but this is very promising for the future!!

Also, I get no one is probably interested in my sex life at all but when I first met him and realised I was in love with him the first thing that scared me was sex. It is part of a normal and healthy relationship but I'd only known pain and have terrible flashbacks. To think that I now have a normal sex like and even dare to take control is such a win for me. And he seemed to love it too. We've never moaned this loud and stayed entangled this long. It was amazing. I'm so happy!!;",stuetel,2019-03-21 18:45:19,3,620,6.13,47.42,59.34,91.39,16.76,9.68,96.45,63.06,24.19,17.9,9.52,2.26,0,6.13,0,6.29,3.55,10.48,11.61,8.55,11.13,1.13,21.29,5,1.77,1.13,2.42,1.61,7.74,5.81,1.77,0.97,0.32,0,11.94,0,0.16,0,6.45,12.58,2.26,1.13,2.58,3.23,1.29,4.03,2.1,0,0.32,1.77,4.84,1.45,0.81,2.1,0,8.39,4.03,1.61,1.45,1.77,0.32,7.42,10.97,2.26,15.32,3.55,3.55,9.03,0.48,0.48,0.32,0,0.16,0,1.61,0.16,0.48,0.48,0.16,0.32,14.68,5.48,2.58,0,0.16,0,0.97,0,0.65,4.03,0.65,0.16
b3zbza,Is pathological lying normal for PTSD?,"My daughter is 18 and away from home for the first time, going to college 200 miles away. She was sexually assaulted at 14 and is recovering. She has PTSD, anxiety, insomnia, depression. She's been seeing a therapist for 3 years and on anti-depressants and anti-anxieties, with mixed success. I am supportive through it all, of course. She's my only child (bit like ""Gilmore Girls"") and I want her to thrive, but also just be okay in her own skin and in her own time. 

About a year ago, she started inventing wild stories. I believed the first: she was attacked by a mugger on a city street. He grabbed her, said vile things and she got away. She was alone and, afterward, rang me in hysterics and I rushed to rescue her. I was horrified, she was terrified, but police had no camera footage. They didn't outright accuse her of lying, but their investigation just went nowhere. 

Two weeks later, a near car accident when a child ran in front of her car. Then she hit a dog with her car. Then someone was outside her window, peering in. Then someone was threatening her in anonymous phone calls. Then another dog. Then someone grabbed her in a mall bathroom. Then a man tried to get into her car at an intersection, but the doors were locked and she sped off. 

Always no evidence, no damage to the car, no bruises. I've begun reacting with no reaction (""Oh, gosh, that's scary. Glad you're okay."") because I dont want to encourage it...? Can I confront her, gently with love, and say, ""Sweetheart, I don't think that really happened."" She's so terribly fragile and I don't want her to think she hasn't got me in her corner. 

I can't confer with her counselor because she's an adult. Her grades are good and she likes school, but these ""events"" give her the permission to cocoon in her room, away from everyone.

b3zip1,Positive EMDR,"I've had experience with EMDR- some of it really negative, as I don't think I was quite ready for that intensity yet.

A few weeks ago, my therapist and I were brainstorming about how to approach my difficulty with connection of my physical sense of body and my cognitive thought, and I told him I felt like I needed to anchor a feeling that had as strong as an impact on me as my trauma. He brought up the idea of using EMDR as a way to reconnect that feeling of being in my body, and the strong positivity of the feeling. He's never used EMDR in that way before, but we figured it was worth a shot.

We tried it yesterday, and I was really surprised at how well it worked. I closed my eyes and went back to the memory, and initially, I was seeing it from a visual/cognitive narrative, but I started to shift more towards how my body felt; I'm so used to a huge vocabulary for negative body sensations that it was hard to verbalize the positive, so I stopped trying and really dove into the feelings I remembered. 

Once I stopped trying to verbalize it, I started feeling echoes of these strong positive feelings, and slowly building them up was such a strange experience, but good kind of strange. When I came back to reality, my therapist was visibly excited, which fueled my excitement as well.

Using EMDR this way was very strange, but surprisingly effective.

b3zyfx,Loss of self,"I've had C-PTSD for a long time. The saga of therapy I spend the better part of a decade on proved less than helpful. I've gone through a long term movement from agonized rage, to deep sorrow, to numbness, to emptiness, to a state of near constant void. Over time the constant state of being painfully overwhelmed and un-grounded has caused me to enter in a state similar to ego death; I'm profoundly disconnected from my identity. Its akin a more extreme level of dissociation expect, unlike dissociation, I feel more aware of it. It is like I know who I am, or was, but no longer feel connected to that person, or any sense of person. I assume this is an artifact of long term PTSD related damage. It seems clear that my sense of disconnection from the self isn't *real,* in as far as  I'm sure there's been no actually change in who I am. Yet the feeling is profoundly distressing, I mean really existentially upsetting. Its really distracting and makes it hard to get on day to day.  Has anyone else experience this? What did you do to cope? I've found some interesting information in neuroscience journals and Buddhist philosophy, but I'm really at a loss. Frankly I'm afraid of it getting worse, or becoming another permanent aspect of long term PTSD damage.

I am self-diagnosing at best here, but everything is terrible and I can't really talk to anyone so maybe this is a place I can connect.

My brother tonight brought up a thing that I thought I was over, but apparently that's not the case since my brain has been buzzing in the bad kind of nicotine-withdrawal way (quit 12 years now!) and my leg won't stop bouncing and I can't imagine trying to lay down in bed any time soon because it'll all just be reliving this shit until god knows when.

&amp;#x200B;

So, background: I'm in my late 30s, whatever, middle-class white guy, nothing to write home about. Four and a half years ago I was hospitalized for some shit. Not important. What's important is that in my post-surgery stay in the ICU, there was a particularly bad encounter that I thought I was done thinking about. Well, the whole hospital stay was horrific but we'll focus on this since it's what's currently relevant.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize I'm not giving any details, but I really don't want to. Suffice it to say that the nurses were not just insensitive to my situation but actively hostile, and the doctors didn't want to deal with anything besides giving the nurses orders to ""get it done."" Yeah, as my brother described to me in way too much detail half an hour ago, ""I've never heard any kind of pain like the screams from your room that night. We were all cringing..."" Thanks, man.

I don't even know what I'm hoping for by posting this here.

b42ld6,Beginning to heal from childhood trauma,"Please bare with me.. this is a long one.

At 27, from the outside, I have all the appearances of a healthy and productive member of society. I have friends, keep a good job, live in a nice city, workout and keep up with hobbies. I spent the last five years out of college crafting a life for myself and living my life in a way I knew would avoid certain triggers.

But, inside I know I’m a ticking time bomb. I walk around in constant fear of being tipped over the edge by something and I’ll end up depressed, jobless, homeless... and worse.

I am am constantly in a heightened state of anxiety and the things I do in my day to day help keep me level, but I fear the impending external factors that can push me over the edge. 

Two year ago I face a string of these external factors within a 6 month time frame — a close relative dying, a sibling almost going to jail for 10 years, my youngest sibling developing a drug problem, my mother divorcing (my somewhat verbally abusive) stepfather, working 7 days a week on a terrible project at work and developing vaginal bleeding and pain with no root cause. 

I was broken and in pain, and I sought out therapy. It helped somewhat, but after a year+ it didn’t feel like the therapist was helping me address the underlying causes. Around this time I switched jobs and insurances and could no longer keep the appointment unless I paid out of pocket. I opted to take this as the push i needed to try and find a new therapist with my new insurance. 

This was four months ago, for various reasons I have not restarted traditional therapy, but I have continued to seek out relief in other areas and I have been obsessed with understanding why I am the way I am.

6 weeks ago, my boyfriend and I decided to take a break — we’ve been long distance the last six months while he’s started his own company and we were at a point where we were talking about moving in together (aka me moving) but not being able to figure out the logistics yet. We didn’t talk for 3 weeks and then when we started talking again, with some much needed perspective, he described to me the one big thing holding him back from thinking I was “the one”.

And it goes back to that terrible mental state I was in last year. After all of the events had happened and during my time confused about my health problem. I had to pick up prints at staples and they messed up the prints. I noticed when I got to the car and basically had a mini meltdown. My boyfriend wasn’t very comforting and didn’t understand what was going on. He took the prints and got the staples person to reprint the corrected ones for free. I had shut down over a seemingly insignificant thing. I didn’t even know how to communicate what i was feeling or why (it was really bad). And my boyfriend felt like he was walking on eggshells around me and was afraid he’d set me off. He avoided talking to me about tough topics and our communication suffered. Even though we have healed a lot, it left a real mark. And I’ve felt the same. I can see the reasons that led to me having that meltdown, but I didn’t fully understand why it had occurred and why I couldn’t cope. Hearing his fears hurt so much, so much more than if we were to just break up. It was hearing my worst fears come to life... my past was catching up to me and holding me bsck from the future I wanted. 

I’ve spent a lot of time on why my coping skills are so stunted in some areas and I’ve reluctantly begun to understand so much of my childhood and upbringing was deeply traumatic for me. I have not come to terms or to face all my demons yet, i plan to do that with more professional help, but I’m slowly trying to write down my memories and to allow myself to cry— this is still something I have such trouble doing at times when I need it most. I hold back the tears to the point where my eyes burn like acid has been poured into them... but then I cry over the most insignificant things like someone cutting me off in traffic.

I am trouble bouncing back after stressful moment and have difficulties being “teased” in even the most playful ways with family, friends or coworkers. I have such a hard time not taking things personally.

I want to get over the trauma of my past and live my life without so much fear. 

——
I do think my parents loved me as a child and do to this day but, I have so much anger towards them that I want to get over. 

My father was a drug addict who never paid child support for his four children.i could never trust when I would see my father after he moved out, I remember waiting for him constantly. And on days when we did get to visit, I acted like a parent helping to take care of my younger siblings and watch out for them. One time when I was 8, my father left me and my 3 younger siblings in the movie theater to “go make a phone call”. My little brother was 2... After a long time had passed, I got worried and took my siblings out of the theater to try and find my dad. We walked out of the theater and passed some stores before someone stopped us to ask where our parents were. Years later I’d find out this incident led to my father not being allowed to see us unsupervised for over a year.


My mother was left to raise us on welfare while she went back to school to try to be able to get a job. My father had been the breadwinner. Just as she finished school and had a great job, she got remarried— and had another child a year later. My stepdad was terrible to me. He constantly teased me and I would get into fights with him. I was the “problem”- it was my back talk and stubbornness were the reasons I was always grounded. He would say mean things about my dads parents and poke fun at my little brother... and I would be scalded for sticking up for them.

My grades in middle school got me into a prestigious high school. I did well my freshman year. My sophomore year was harder. I lacked a real support day to day and to my parents “chores” were more important and school work. I was chronically tired and I’ll that year. I got into trouble at school for tardiness and absences. My grades suffered slightly, but when you start out with high 90s/100 and drop to a 90 (still considered an A, you still look fine to your family). Little did they understand that 90 meant I was bottom 25% of my classs... school stress got worse as home stress progressed. 

Fall of my junior year, my stepdad kicked me out because we had a fight. I went to my grandparents house to stay a few days and came home to all of my things in garbage bags outside of their front door. Four months later I had my first full blown panic attack. I didn’t tell any of the adults in my life. Only my bf knew. He tried to help and even stole Xanax from his mom to give to me for an emergency. I was so afraid, I wouldn’t even take the medicine if I needed it. I spent the next 6 months in a highly dissociative state— always on edge and always not trusting myself and my body. On my way to school, I would be afraid to stand on the train platform as the train approached. I was afraid I’d jump off the platform just to see what work happen. I didn’t want to die, but I was numb and nothing felt real. 

The next 10 years of my life can be described as an emotional rollercoaster of good and bad. College wasn’t easy, but I finished, got a good job, moved to a great city and only progressed in my career.

But, I know I’m held back, the events I remember and can bare to talk about are just the tip of the iceberg, i know I’m being held back, and I don’t want my future to be so negatively determined by my past. I am grateful for having crafted a skill set to let me get by, but I dont want to just get by, I want to be able to live and love— and be loved.

b42y6i,i need help or support or something please,"*TW: rape/ harassment* 

last friday i found out that after a year of investigation and all that, that my rapist is getting charged with rape 3. the charges have not been filed yet, which has been causing some of the worst anxiety i’ve had. my rapist is not the kind or person to think about consequences of his actions. he’s broken more laws then i can count and has a list of crimes longer than anyone i know his age. a year and half ago when i told my parents and my school at the time along with reporting it to the police he became very angry. sending death threats, having his friends send pictures of guns, people taunting me at school etc. he would come up to me at school in front of a big group of people to yell at me in my face with my address in his phone saying he would come kill my family etc. and that was all just about me getting a sexual assault protection order against him and for cominh forward. it’s been well over a year since that and to my knowledge he doesn’t know i went ahead with a criminal investigation with the hopes of pressing charges. this terrifies me to think about. everyone i told who knows him well or even more than i know him, have told me that there is no way he will react well to this. and i know that too. i have a security system at my house and my new school knows everything and has a great security system but i cannot shake the fear. i know him threatening me after the charges are filed would be witness tampering but after everything he’s put me and my family through and the intense fear for my life and safety that i have felt because of him tells me no law or possibility of consequences passes though his head. he thinks he’s above it all. last night i had a nightmare about him coming to my house and when i woke up this morning i told my mom i probably wouldn’t make it through the whole school day but i would try. i went to my first class cried a bit and then had a break in between classes. i was in the bathroom in a full blown panic attack just imagining the worst shit ever. i went home after my first class and pretty much cried for a good hour and then just kinda dissociated for a bit just laying staring at the wall. i’m feeling a bit better and i have therapy tomorrow but i just don’t know what i need. i just want this all to happen so it can end sooner. i don’t know what i’m hoping to get out of this but i think i jus need some support. i don’t talk about this with friends because it’s hard for them to give me advice and i don’t like feeling like a burden. are there any precautions i should take before the charges are filed? should i lay low?? i don’t know.

b43f5m,I fall asleep and wake up without any memories,"I don’t know if anyone Understands this, but when I go to sleep my body relaxes so deeply that when I wake in the morning, I have no memory of my trauma or of who I am. 

As the day goes on I try to remember the events (being abandoned by my ex and the huge breakdown I had). 

I can only describe it blank. Completely blank. 

I feel like someone took my brain out and put a pile of rocks in there. 

There is something about my body relaxing that makes my mind forget everything. And if my body can’t feel the trauma then neither does my mind. 

I have serious dpdr and haven’t felt real for so long. I feel like I’ve lost my mind and have no idea what to do. 

I take fish oil and b vitamins, what do I do?

b4491v,How do I help my stubborn boyfriend understand that I’m going through something actually serious?,"My boyfriend is a wonderful person. I want to make that very clear. He’s not purposefully being shitty to make me feel bad. He doesn’t understand what seems to both of us an impossible problem and he gets very frustrated about it and I’m no help either because I can’t make the words do word stuff when I’m in the thick of it all. I’m not sure how this sub reacts to this type of stuff, but others tend to highly recommend the most nuclear course of action and I just wanna make it clear that isn’t an option for me. If it’s what he wants then fine but it’s not gonna happen on my end. I love this man to the moon and back, warts and all.

Anyway, my ptsd has been getting really awful lately. I’m not on medication but I’m about to get onto a waiting list for therapy. I’m barely eating and only sleep a handful of hours at a time. Intrusive thoughts and memories are pretty much a constant livestream and go from images of my abuses to doing horrific things to people around me and everything in between. I fucking hate it, I’m hugely ashamed of it and I actually haven’t even told my boyfriend this part because it terrifies me so much (he’ll find out when I show him this thread though). I don’t want to hurt people and I don’t want to drive my car off the bridge and I don’t want to stick my face into the meat grinder at work but this shit is fucking constant. But it’s NOT an impulse, just a thought, thankfully, and I do know the difference. I’m ashamed of this too but my behaviour has been extremely difficult to control and I’ve been rude and hurtful to my boyfriend and friends. I haven’t meant to and I didn’t think that would be the result at the time, because it’s hard to believe anyone gives a shit what I do, but that’s what happened anyway. I did apologize and my friends were very kind though.

My boyfriend doesn’t get it. Like super hard doesn’t get it. I think he wants to and he wants to help but he doesn’t know how. He has anxiety and I do too so we relate a little bit on that but mine is rooted in different things and I’m much more aware of how anxiety works and affects people and me in particular so he still sort of doesn’t get that. It took me a while to convince him that anxiety is NOT my problem right now haha, although I didn’t talk about the ptsd much, and we’ll see why.

He sort of tends to jump to conclusions about what I’m talking about (paraphrased example conversation from last night:
Me: I feel like my friends don’t want to talk to me at all because x and y
Him: is it at work?
Me: it’s at work, it’s at hang outs—
Him, interrupting: during the rush people can’t joke around with you! They’re busy!
I fuckin get that. I’m busy too. I didn’t even mention the rush omg I’m not talking about during the rush lmao I don’t care if I shoot my buddy a joke and he can’t respond bc he’s somehow plating 12 things with just 2 hands). It’s frustrating and hurtful because that’s not what I’m even talking about, but he doesn’t let me get to my actual point, which is always different from what he thinks, without assuming I’m just being a little bitch and losing it. Sometimes he comes off like he thinks I’m highly exaggerating. The thought of him thinking I’m bullshitting him or being a whiny brat child really hurts. I don’t feel listened to or like my real issues are respected, so I don’t want to talk to him about it, and then he gets offended and hurt that I don’t tell him things. But he can’t have it both ways.

We also only ever talk about it on his terms. I understand him being tired from work because I usually don’t want to talk about it then either. But he’ll get drunk and start talking to me and that’s when we have our problems and he seems mad (he often says he’s not and he’s definitely not the type to pretend he’s not mad so maybe he’s just being rambunctious lol!). But it’s really rare I can be like “babe I’m really hurting can we talk” and have him say “yes let’s do that right now” or even have him be willing to talk about it within the next few days. Sometimes it takes like a week or more for him to be willing then I just feel embarrassed and shitty and pushy because I kept harping on him about it. I don’t wanna push him or make him talk or be a demanding dick but I just really need him right now.

I just want to know what he wants from me. I can’t just flip a switch and be cured and I need support because I can’t go through this on my own but all he has to say is that he’s sick of my bitching. I want to get better so badly and have everything be good but he says he sees no effort from me. It takes everything in me just to get through a day and he thinks I’m pathetic.

I get why it seems like I’m not trying to do anything but he also has no idea what ptsd is or how it affects the brain and body in literally a physical way. He doesn’t even know what the symptoms are and he thinks he can tell me how to live my life and why I’m doing everything wrong because it’s not how he, who knows literally nothing about this particular illness and has made zero effort to educate himself, thinks I should be doing things. It makes me very angry actually, especially because I did initially follow his advice and tried to tune the ptsd out and distract myself like you do with a bad day. Anyone fucking surprised that I’m this much fucking worse now because that’s literally the exact opposite thing you’re supposed to do for ptsd and intrusive thoughts? It’s really not his fault because I should have done more research earlier and it was my choice to listen to him and honestly that part doesn’t even really matter because fuck it, whatever, I’m worse now and gotta just deal with it. The worst part is that he isn’t even stupid! He’s so intelligent in so many ways, he’s just SO SO stubborn. People have also bullied him a lot for being ~stupid~ because he doesn’t ~read books~ as if that fucking matters a bit, so I have a little theory that he feels really insecure for not getting it and the way I’m going about trying to make him understand how little he understands is probably making him feel worse. Idk, this ended up really rambly and a little angry but I’m so lost.

I sent him a couple articles but he hasn’t read them yet and I keep trying to explain over and over but I’m not doing it very well at all. I am literally dying for him to just hug me tightly and tell me that he knows this isn’t who I really am on the inside and that I’ll be okay and I can do this and he’s there for me and loves me. What are the words I use? How did you guys help stubborn people see?

Even further, those that sent you were your parents? Taking that a step further,  the whole situation was based on lies..

because in reality, you were a very healthy person; never depressed, very hopeful/optimistic etc, drug/alcohol free...

you just were so incredibly different than your family, and they misunderstood you to the point of thinking something was wrong with you.

the parents spoke with a therapist who set the whole thing in motion, with the help of corrupt lawyers...

not ONE person spoke to the man they wanted to involuntarily “treat”... not one of the lawyers, the therapist never even met or spoke to him...

nobody decided to hear the mans perspective, ask to speak to anyone close to him etc.

so he was woken up at 4am by two SHERIFFS and his dad, telling him he was going downtown..

he was handcuffed in his own bedroom, taken downtown in the back of the sheriffs car without his parents..

he was forced to stay there for 5 days, take medication he didn’t want to... 
it was over before it started...

the mans parents had a report written that explained the reasons why he was sent to the psych ward...

no doctor, nobody listened to me explaining my perspective.. they took the parents assumptions as fact.

She confirms I have PTSD, prescribed me to Prazosin for night terrors.  I’m going to see therapist for PTSD in a couple weeks.  Have anyone tried this medicine and how do you cope PTSD? And most importantly, how do my boyfriend help/what can he do?  I think he feels helpless because I do not like to talk about my traumatic experiences and I feel like it might put a strain on our relationship or I might be overthinking.  I do love him deeply although I don’t show it enough, I don’t want to lose him.  He tries to support me, assures me I’m safe. Mind you, I live in protected building with security key to enter into building with front/back door cameras.  I’m kind of in denial, I’m not sure how to process this..5 days later I’m still digesting with the new diagnosis of PTSD.  I already have anxiety and was diagnosed it earlier this year.  I’m on Buspar for anxiety, it’s been helpful.  I hope I’m doing the first post right lol

b4b73f,Hard time being a helping hand,"About last year i met a girl who i went on a few dates with. We knew each other for maybe a month, but we had both been through some really rough things and were able to bond over being survivors. After our third or fourth date, she messaged me letting me know that she was about to kill herself with her mom's gun that she had stolen. I was able to call her and I stalled her all night until her mom woke up and took the gun from her. A little after getting into the mental hospital the day after though, she hung herself with the drawstring of her sweatpants, which some criminally incompetent fuck had neglected to confiscate from her. This had me unable to leave my bed for about a week straight, and was one of like fucking 50 horrible things that happened in the span of 3 months that made me drop out of high school and go to a mental hospital myself.

A year later, i'm doing okay and I'm enrolled in college, but the anniversary of her death has me really messed up. On top of that, suddenly a friend from back home is extremely suicidal along with a girl i know who lives a few floors below me, and both are exclusively talking to me and refusing to get help from their family or the college. I'm having to talk them both out of killing themselves or hurting themselves on a daily basis and it's so fucking draining. 

Having to put their burden on my shoulders is awful, but i know that if i did anything less than my fullest to keep them alive then i might kill myself too. I've been having nightly convulsing attacks where i can't stop screaming, stemming from the guilt of not being able to save that first girl and from the fear of not being able to save the girls i know now. Once these panic attacks/ptsd events/whatever the fuck happen it dredges up every rape i went through, every friend who died, every time my mom went and destroyed something in a fit of rage, everything awful. This daily cycle of talking one person down from a ledge, cramming for finals, spending 2 hours screaming and writhing in pain, then talking another person down is killing me.

Part of me just wants to tell them both to just fucking do it already. I have one day of pleasant conversation with someone and suddenly i'm their crisis counselor for the next fucking century. I've spent like 90% of our conversations offering help and getting shot down, and it's almost like there was no friendship there to begin with. Every person i meet is friendly face that's just the tip of another traumatic iceberg that i end up having to solve. I feel like an 1800's orphan with popcorn lung working in the coal mine of clinical depression for 3 pennies an hour. How do i make them better? How do i take the giant ""free therapist"" sticker off my forehead so people stop treating me like a whore for mental health help? How do i at least push this onto someone who isn't trying not to kill themselves too? Can i at least monetize all the fucking hours of coercing and bullshit i have to deal with every day? Is it fucked up to joke about that? Who knows. I almost despise them at this point, but i'd despise myself even more if they died.

TLDR: sort of girlfriend killed themselves last year, now two of my friends are suicidal and it's triggering PTSD attacks.

I'm happy with my life as a whole, but still have painful daily symptoms. Last night I had a nightmare of my abuser and have been unsettled all day. But I can come here, I can vent, I can even try to help each of you with techniques or coping skills I've learned over the years. Y'all give me hope, I feel the love, and thank you all again.

b4c15a,Going through what feels like a depressive episode and I don’t even have anywhere to go to cry,"I’m a college student with PTSD. I’ve had a good few weeks: new friends, started a new job, my health was improving (I have a chronic illness), better grades. I had just gotten over a depressive episode in the fall/late winter that involved going back to self harm, which I hadn’t done in years. But I quit and I thought I was doing better. No more weekends in bed, nights spent crying in the bathroom, days without eating or speaking to anyone. 

But a friend got me talking this morning about a recent sexual assault that happened to me and I lost it. I’ve been sick all day. All over body aches, numbness, self loathing and deep regret, loneliness. 

I get back to my apartment after class, wanting nothing more than to lay in bed and sleep this off hoping it won’t spiral into something worse. I’m in a dorm apartment so I share my bedroom w a roommate who was chosen at random and we don’t get along, and she was in bed watching TV loudly so I just laid down on the couch in the other room and fell asleep watching Netflix and cried silently so she wouldn’t hear me. Next thing I know, there’s a loud noise in the living room waking me up. She’s plugging in the lamp, flipping it on, and staring at me laying on the couch with annoyance. She then turns off the light and shuts herself back into our bedroom. I can’t even cry or sleep in my own home without being looked down upon with disgust.

I was doing so well and things just took such an abrupt turn for the worse. My friends are out of town and I have no family nearby, not that they care anyways. I just don’t rly know what to do other than lay on the couch all night and feel sick to my stomach about what’s happened to me.

(Say whatever you want about my situation, but pls do not tell me to go to a college therapist rn.

Alongside my biggest crush, an amazing person from the other side of the tracks. It wasn't of the stars.

In high school we dated for a while, but you know, sparks never really flew. It was more like two of the same people, just safe, just hanging out.

When I left for Iraq they asked me to stay. It had been a year, and I knew that if I did stay, I couldn't ever be the person they deserved.

So I left.

On my first second tour they were in a car accident and in a coma for almost two months.
When I saw them, they didn't even remember me.

Neither did I; remember me.

We talk maybe once a year, but it's hard. It's harder to remember who I was than it is to remember who they were.

Life happens, it moves on. We change. I don't yet know what that means.
What I did learn, is that there is only one world to rule. And it's your own.

I have trichotillomania that comes and goes in waves based on my stress flareups. For years it was so bad I barely had hair. I have mostly a full head now but have some bare spots, and have been in a pulling funk. I need to wear a hat to avoid pulling.

I’m 7 months out of an abusive relationship and just had a major setback earlier seeing my ex on Facebook. I must have pulled for an hour, but I know it was related to flashbacks.

I know I should be angry with him, but I’m angry with myself for allowing myself to pull when I knew I wanted to stop.

b4gtno,Suicide ideation,"After being violently raped two years ago, I wanted to die. I never wanted to kill myself, but I would dream of getting into accidents and dying instantly. Since then, I have thought about how I would want to kill myself. I always knew I would never be able to do that to my family. But I thought about it. 

For the first time two weeks ago, I considered killing myself. A quick thought popped into my head (“I could do it this weekend”) but then it was gone. 

Tonight, I was feeling so overwhelmed by my PTSD and completely detached from the world around me. I had always been able to destress by running or working out, but I am currently injured on crutches and cannot walk without excruciating pain. So, I was crying and panicking and thought about killing myself, and I instantly felt calm. This idea of killing myself continues to bring such a sense of relief and calmness into my life. 

It also scared me a bit, of course. I don’t think it’s normal, and I still keep reminding myself how difficult the holidays would be for my family if I went through with it. 

At what point does this relief become a problem? I don’t actually want to do it, right? I just do see it as making all of my problems and shit go away. I would write letters to all my loved ones, and I would write a post detailing how my rapists ruined my life, and the police made it worse. 

I know I don’t want to kill myself. I’m just scared by the relief of the idea. Does anyone else have experience with suicide ideation, particularly relating to PTSD?

b4hflo,Mother Called me a b***h,"My grandmother died and nobody in my family called to tell me. My parents abandoned me after my brother committed suicide when I was 17 and he was 15. 
I texted my aunt to ask her why she didn’t tell me. I found out about it through obituaries when it was too late. 
Got a voicemail in my blocked messages from my mother that began “hi sweetie” and it was the first time I’d heard her voice in three years. It went on to say “stop harassing my sister, you fucking bitch. Bye”
I wasn’t harassing anyone. The fact that she began with “hi sweetie” made me think for a split second that she wanted to make an effort in our relationship (or complete lack thereof.)

I’m just heartbroken and needed to vent.

b4ioak,Partner with ptsd started lying about drug abuse,"My partner was diagnosed with ptsd a year ago, went through therapy that made things a little better but after his sessions were over he was no longer eligible for another therapy, he had to wait 3 months to apply for a new one which is now supposed to start in a month.
He’s suffered from insomnia for the whole time but didn’t want to take any medication. Then he started experimenting with drugs, to alleviate the anxiety and chest pains, first mdma but then he switched to cocaine and now he’s hooked. I found out about it through reddit actually, that’s funny.... Yesterday he told me he has spent all his savings on drugs and more, he’s now indebted. The way he put it was that it also means he cannot come see me (we live 3 hours apart) because he cannot afford to buy a ticket (approx. 200 euros). His family doesn’t know. He has one friend who knows probably way more than I do about his drug consumption. Otherwise none of his friends know because before this he was very anti-drug and says he actually hates taking them.
After yesterday I feel like I tend to be the first person to be thrown overboard when shit hits the fan. I feel really shitty about how he’s treated me. None of my friends know either. 
What are your thoughts please? Is this some kind of a pattern to kick the closest person next to you? We’ve been together for 3 years so things have not always been like this.

b4kh01,"i have so much work to do and i cannot focus. fuck this TW: child sexual abuse, police","loooooooong story short: i was sexually exploited by multiple men online from the age of 12 to the age of 17. the most siginificant period was age 13 to 17 where i was consistently in contact with the same guy and was mentally abused/coerced into sending him videos/pictures/voice clips etc while also being forced to allow him to have passwords to all my social media/email accounts, even shared my school's grading system with him. he would sometimes invite friends to watch/listen to me, and he has 1000s of pics/videos from that time. i was able to shut it out to some extent for my senior year of high school and some of my freshman year of college, but im having trouble recently.

&amp;#x200B;

a couple of months ago i submitted a cyber tip to the center for missing and exploited children, then was contacted by a detective about two weeks later. since then, i have shared identifying documents, emails, chat names, etc with the detective as well as made a sworn testimony to be used in prosecution/justification for a search warrant. this guy works at a gamestop as a manager so i know he has access to some adolescents more than some people might and i know how he rolls online so i couldnt avoid testimony anymore...i was also killing myself by searching his information compulsively and personally notifying his girlfriends if i could contact them.

&amp;#x200B;

i was told that the case would take around a month or more...it's been a couple weeks and i haven't heard back from the detective who said he would contact me that day or within the week with numbers for the other departments that will now be working on my case. i sent him an email to see what's up, but i can't get this shit out of my head. i have three midterm projects i need to complete this week that i've only barely started because iw as on vacation and now that im back im so depressed and living in such a fog. i dont know why i try. i cant even really focus my vision let alone my mind for fucking coding. how am i supposed to be normal?? 

&amp;#x200B;

do any of you have any tips for getting out of this fog just long enough to focus on a task? i can sink back in a bit if i need to but i really just feel  stuck right now and i need to get good grades in these courses or i'll lose my scholarship/ all sorts of opportunities which i cannot afford because im a 1st gen student. my grades so far are ok but this has really been taking a toll on my ability to focus.",procrochetnator,2019-03-23 08:37:28,1,488,47.21,24.93,61.46,10.31,27.11,14.14,86.07,55.53,16.39,12.3,9.63,0,0.2,2.25,0.2,4.1,5.12,14.55,9.84,6.15,7.79,1.43,17.01,3.69,2.25,1.43,1.23,3.28,3.69,1.23,2.46,0.2,1.23,0.82,8.61,0,1.43,0,2.87,12.3,1.43,2.25,2.05,3.69,0.61,3.89,2.46,1.43,0.82,0.2,1.43,0.41,0.2,0.82,0,7.99,1.43,1.64,3.07,1.64,0.61,4.71,10.25,1.02,12.09,0.41,5.94,6.35,3.69,1.02,0,0.41,0,0.2,1.02,0.61,0,0.2,0.2,0,12.91,4.3,2.05,0.41,1.23,0.61,0,0,0,1.43,0,2.87

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone suffer from chronic fatigue that is almost 100% to be caused by PTSD? Since high school(5/6 years ago), where I was bullied for \~1.5 years I have PTSD and at the same time I developped chronic fatigue. I still suffer from the bullying(I dream of it on \~1/3 of my dreams), so I guess my brain is more focusing on it than normal regeneration. I don't know for 100% sure that it is from PTSD, can anyone confirm if it is common?

b4l9ea,I disclosed,"

Wednesday evening I had a guy I’ve been seeing the last month or so come over to my place. We’d slept together before, and I’d already felt relatively safe, but this time I got triggered. I don’t know why, maybe it was the stress, but when he bit my leg (something I usually enjoy) I triggered, and I started flailing and kicking, then rolled over on my side and covered my face. He was gentle and checked on me and I apologized, and he pulled me in to cuddle. After I calmed down a bit, I said something about how we should talk about it, he said that we didn’t have to. 

I don’t disclose. I was in denial of my rapes and abuse for years, and when it all came out I told my boyfriend at the time. We’d been together for years, we lived together, I completely believed that he was going to be supportive. Instead he verbally abused me for hours, told me I was a slut and a liar and other horrible things. I have struggled with disclosure ever since, and have missed out on potential relationships because my fear of disclosing makes me disconnected and withdrawn. Disclosure is a huge barrier for me. 

But I disclosed. I had to work myself up to it, and he was patient. He already knew I had ptsd, so I said “my ptsd comes from sexual assault and domestic violence.” I talked a little about it and explained my reaction. I had to work myself up to it, but I did it. I was still very activated so I put on music and told him we should talk about other things to distract me, so he let me show him all my gemstones I recently got. He literally listened to me talk about rocks. I managed to pull myself back and finish having sex with him, and he was gentle even though I knew it wasn’t his preference. I kept apologizing to him about everything that happened and he told me it was okay, and to stop apologizing. 

This is a huge event for me. Disclosure to a sexual partner has never been successful for me. Most of the time it doesn’t happen. Potential relationships have been impaired by my avoidance. Disclosure itself carries trauma for me. I’ve been talking in therapy about how to disclose for years. So this is a big deal for me. And I’m proud of me. I hope that this means I’ll start being able to have this discussion with more serious romantic partners and I’ll stop ruining relationships.

b4lj8z,I just want to be normal?,"I, the other day, had a girl sleeping in my bed. I had fallen asleep turned away from her. At some point she put her arm around me and I started screaming and crying and reaching for my pistol (I keep it unloaded because I know this is a thing, but I can't sleep if I don't have it near me). I don't remember this happening, but the girl's recount, and the fact that police showed up to my house make it all the more real to me despite my amnesia of the incident.

 I don't want this to be a thing anymote. Every girl I've been attached to for any long period of time has gotten acclimated to how I am. But I know that such an acclimation is too much to ask. And I don't want to always be this broken. I'm crying now just thinking of how I'm fucking doomed to repeat this cycle over and over again. I don't want to be scared anymore.

b4oeds,Crippling fear of abandonment,"Hi guys! I’m 19 years old and was diagnosed with PTSD a year ago after a suicide attempt, my two traumatic experiences are my father and my first boyfriend. ANYWAY

I have actual friends and an actual loving boyfriend for the first time in my life but every so often I have a mental breakdown and am literally incapacitated by my crippling fear of abandonment. I was so convinced a few days ago that my boyfriend was going to leave me (there was literally no trigger to this, it just happened out of nowhere) that I ended up having a huge panic attack and sobbing and not being able to move or function for a couple days. 

I really just want to be normal and I want to be able to accept that I deserve love and good things. Does anyone have any tips for overcoming this?

b4ogm3,PTSD (sexual assault),"Hi. So.. this is my last hope before I just give up. 
I’ll try to make this short.. I’ve been sexually assaulted (1 of the 5 was penetration) by 5 different men in my life. “1” happened regularly from my ages 6 to 9 (moms boyfriend). “2” and “3” were a few separate occasions sprinkled over my late elementary years (uncle and cousin). “4” drugged me and I woke up during penetration (friends friend, the only situation where I was penetrated). And “5” was violent sexual assault with no penetration (dads drug dealer). *sigh*.. I’ve tried going through court and got trashed every single time. Authorities don’t believe me, flat out said it wasn’t important to them. I even had a therapist tell me that what my problem was is that I self medicate with marijuana so my brain isn’t developed right I guess? I don’t know what calming down to go to bed has to do with being hyper vigilant and having panic attacks every 5 minutes that I’m outside of my home because no one has ever believed a word I said and if my brain is underdeveloped it’s totally because of the 2 years I’ve been lightly smoking and definitely not because I was being sexually stimulated for a very long time before the age of 16 but *shrug* what do I know I’m not a psychologist. (For the record, I agreed to a psychiatric evaluation and I also agreed to stop smoking for a month and try actual medication again to see if that works, which they never even tried.) I guess I should also tag on that I got in a horrible highway accident 2 years ago, my friend fell asleep at the wheel doing over 80 so I have PTSD from that too I am like an old cat that has never even been outside. Good luck on that car ride 👍🏼 
Anyway.. I’m trying to get help.. I’ve been with my significant other for a very long time now and I feel horrible because I know if that person didn’t exist I would not care so much about living and having a future. But I can’t work. I have tried I can’t even get a job because of how horrible my anxiety is during the interview. And even jobs I’ve gotten I mess up way too much I can’t keep a job longer than 2 days.. so my significant other spends every second they’re awake working and every penny they have goes to feeding us and paying bills.. every night we cry together because we don’t know how long we’re going to have a place to live we don’t know how much longer we are going to be able to live like this .. this isn’t even living.. this is surviving on the absolute minimum.. and I feel horrible because my love has so much potential to do so many great things but I can’t get anyone to help me so just my existence is taking that opportunity away from them.. I’ve been trying to get government assistance with PTSD from sexual assault.. I have every single symptom.. every one.. I’m a hermit and I am happy that way but I know there’s so many people being fraudulent .. I am not but I am too scared to talk to anybody because every time I’ve tried I immediately get shut down. I am a very sweet soft spoken person that never lashes out and I cry a lot and get scared very easily. So it’s hard for me to fight back I just kind of say “okay I’m sorry..” I know it’s pathetic but I shut down. As soon as I think they’re not listening with an open mind I’m no longer interested in talking.. I’m a very hurt person and it makes it that much worse every time I have to talk about it and it hurts that much more every time it gets rejected.. I just need someone to listen.. I need someone to help.. my other half needs it.. I can’t keep holding them back like this it’s tearing what little happiness I have left apart.. so if you’re reading this.. and you think there’s any way at all that you could help, I am desperate.. I live in southwest MI I am willing to travel long distances to see a professional.. if any one knows someone that could help me, you will be helping save two lives and we will be eternally grateful to you and I promise we will pay it forward every opportunity we have. Thank you for your support..

b4oxo0,Do I have ptsd?,"3 months ago my dad had as stroke. It hit me very hard at the time it happened. My mom called me to their house and my dad was just laying on the floor pretty much motionless. I thought he died because I didn’t know what happened by then he lifted his head and greeted me. My family is like that. So we go to the hospital long story short he’s alive but lost a lot of mobility on his left side. He is making progress. He was in rehab at the hospital for 2 months and came home in January. I felt fine about the whole situation because he was doing better and getting better. Still is too. Then a month ago I had a health scare. Which I think was more of just me scaring myself. I had a blood test done and a ct scan of my abdomen and everything came back totally normal. After that I just get anxious on and off and didn’t know why. My wife finally suggested I may have ptsd from my dad and then the “health scare” I had. I’ve always had anxiety but it was more situational like having to talk in front of class, flying on a plane, riding rollercoasters. Now it just seems totally random off and on. My heart races liked crazy, I get nauseous sometimes, loose stools a lot. I think a lot of it has to do with googling symptoms which just makes it’s worse. I don’t know what to do from here.

b4psts,Recovery isn't a straight line?,"I had EMDR a year ago and felt incredible afterwards. My symptoms massively reduced and I felt able to get on with my life.
A few nights ago I felt like I wanted to get my story down and I wrote every night since until I was 'finished' at least up until a point that I was satisfied with. I wrote just about the trauma, the lead up and the day or so after and didn't really speak about the development of PTSD symptoms as such which happened a few weeks later.
It was tonight that I finished and I had a major dissociative episode afterwards. I could barely move and any attempt to ground myself I found myself just slipping back.
I hadn't had anything like this since EMDR finished and I'm now sat worrying about if this is going to be a regular thing again. The past couple of days I feel like I've been reliving - though I'd say not flashbacks like I used to get - the times around the trauma and found it difficult to stop thinking about the city I was in at the time. This seemed like it would be a good idea to get things out but now I'm worried I've pushed myself too far.
I know recovery isn't a straight line, we go back and then we move forward again. Has anybody else experienced a brief resurfacing of symptoms that had reduced or ceased, only to then move forward, and not backward?",wrigglegrrl,2019-03-23 16:42:18,4,254,42.43,6.75,99,10.75,21.17,14.96,94.09,60.24,17.32,11.81,11.02,0.79,0,0,0,5.51,7.48,14.57,9.45,7.87,8.66,2.36,21.65,5.12,3.54,0.39,0,2.36,2.76,0.79,1.97,0.79,0,0,2.36,0,0,0,0,13.39,3.94,1.57,1.57,3.15,0.39,4.72,2.76,0,0.79,1.57,1.57,0,1.57,0,0,6.69,0.79,1.57,1.57,1.97,1.18,11.42,9.45,1.57,22.83,4.72,7.87,13.39,1.57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.42,3.94,1.57,0,0,0.79,0,0.79,0,4.33,0,0
b4q2er,Follow-up Post,"I posted a few weeks ago that I was dating someone with PTSD. I ordered a few books and have delved into The Body Keeps the Score which by the way is a great read! 

I am however struggling with how to deal with one symptom of PTSD and that’s the lies. None of these lies are harmful to me and some of them are just silly. I know when my BF is lying but I haven’t yet talked to him about this. Mostly because I want to make sure I approach it right to let him know that I know he’s not telling the truth but I also want to be supportive.

My thought is that it’s some sort of defense mechanism.  Can anyone provide some insight? How do you recommend dealing with this?

b4qd61,I think March is cursed. (TW),"TW: suicide, grandparent in hospital

This weekend is my birthday. This week last year, my mother planned to commit suicide shortly after we got away from a bad situation. We were able to interrupt her plans just in time. My PTSD - understandably - is acting up, and I have a chronic pain condition that I’m not managing well because I don’t have full mental capacity right now. I had hoped I could start to make progress past it.

So, here we are a year later. I have a grandparent in the hospital who is not doing well. I feel guilty for not showing up at the hospital, but the hospital is triggering. Being around my family is triggering. Leaving my house is difficult because of health issues and because my brain is forcing me to remember things I don’t want to think about. I want to pretend my birthday doesn’t exist, because it’s *not important* compared to everything else. And because *I’m* not important. But then I feel like that’s selfish thinking, which brings me right back to feeling guilty for not showing up...I kind of feel guilty for posting this, honestly.

This occurred late at night and as a result I have a very difficult time being in public during the night as it triggers my ptsd. However, during the moment I’ll have hot flashes, my throat will feel dry, and I will begin to become nauseas and panic. Unfortunately i don’t think “oh this is a ptsd trigger!” I tend to think “I’m going to die I need to get out of here” does anyone have any advice on how to change my way of thinking during these episodes?

b4sn47,Does anyone here have PTSD from drug use?,"I’ve heard that this is possible, and I was just wondering if anyone has experienced this before I sought help about it. I was a drug user for four years (over one year clean now). I can’t listen to a whole genre of music because it immediately takes me back to using. And certain songs, I just have to turn off immediately if I hear them. Or sometimes just the smell of a certain shampoo can take me back, or the smell of the air outside. I struggled with nightmares about relapsing a lot too, though I haven’t had them in a while.

b4suqv,PTSD and chronic pain/fibromyalgia,"I'm curious about whether or not others with PTSD have fibromyalgia/a lot of chronic pain.

I experience a lot of pain. I have endometriosis (as far as I know...a doctor told me - after nine years of symptoms - that I likely have it, but they won't know for sure until I have surgery to remove it). But I also have pain all over. My neck and shoulders and head hurt almost all the time, even if I stretch and massage them. My legs and hips and buttocks hurt, too....sometimes achy like they're tight, sometimes like I have the flu, sometimes like I'm restless almost (especially at night). I just recently started having issues with my wrists. They've hurt before, but normally they get better...however, they're hurting pretty much constantly now (might be carpal tunnel - I'm a comm major and write all the time). My stomach is a mess, but that may be endo. My muscles twitch (especially my eyes/eyelids? It's weird) and I'm just. Tired.

I think I might have fibromyalgia or SOMETHING besides endo because this doesn't seem normal. And I've heard a lot of people with PTSD have fibro. Does anyone know if this sounds like fibro? It's stupid but I feel like I'm overreacting, even though I'm in pain pretty much all the time.

Just a note on my PTSD/history: I was abused as a kid/teen by a best friend, and then was in an abusive relationship for a few months that I got out of in November. Have had pain for years. Like...as long as I can remember, maybe. At least since puberty, if not before.",risingsun1999,2019-03-23 22:21:38,4,282,29.8,10.1,94.31,1,13.43,14.54,91.84,58.87,16.31,12.06,10.64,0,0,0,1.42,4.26,5.32,13.83,12.41,6.03,11.35,1.42,18.09,6.74,6.38,0.35,0.35,3.9,7.8,2.13,5.67,0.35,1.06,1.42,4.96,0,0.35,0,0,18.09,2.84,0.71,1.77,7.8,2.48,5.67,6.03,0.71,0.71,4.26,8.51,3.55,5.32,0,0,3.55,0.71,0.71,1.77,1.42,0,3.19,12.77,1.77,13.12,0.71,3.9,8.51,0.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,26.95,10.99,4.26,0.35,0,0.71,0,1.06,0,4.96,2.84,1.77
b4t43n,Do I have PTSD --- medical error,"Hi, 

1 year ago a doctor ripped my eardum when he was supposed to do a cleaning. This created a number of symptoms including a permanent ""head cold"" feeling, tinnitus, and other discomforts.

I think about this all the time and I'm waiting for surgery to repair the damage. I have a lot of bottled up anger about the issue and I feel that unless they can fix it my life in the future won't be worth living. I've stopped caring about many other things in life that I used to enjoy -- and everytime I speak i'm reminded of the misery because it my voices echoes in my skull due to the acoustic conditions of the eardrum.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, right now im trying to fix acid reflux which is either caused or worsened by my anxiety and resentment. I'm wondering if I should seek some sort of PTSD treatement or strategy in case my mind might be going to fight or flight 200 times per day everytime I feel my ear acting up.

b4v4kl,"hi...new here. Diagnosed with PTSD recently, realizing I can no longer work as a first responder. Struggling with identity and purpose.","Before anyone worries, I will spare the fine details of what brought me to this point, im not sure I even remember them all anymore. And yes i am seeing a psychiatrist and now a therapist too. Just needing to vent. I entered EMT school at 17. 22 now, paramedic, and the warning signs ive pushed off for years have caved in collapsing onto my life all at once. I cant pinpoint a specific event or memory that broke me. Theres too many of them. I re-live a different one every night, wake up to respond to “phantom tones” until i realize that im at home, and lately the nightmares have decided to creep into the daylight as i have begun having flashbacks (i think thats what they are). A child could be playing outside and scream happily but i wont understand that. Ill hear the scream and my heart races, i sweat, my hair stands up, im suddenly aware of everything around me, “its happening again, not again please not another one” as i rush out the door expecting to find the same sort of scene as the dozens that haunt me. I used to be so well-tempered. Now i lash out at people wildly and it makes no sense why. Ive lost interest in all my hobbies i once had. I have based my entire identity and purpose around my work. Ive given so much.. sleepless nights during 48 hour shifts, constant Tears that i held in until alone because I had to be strong for others in the most tragic of moments, ive been assaulted countless times by patients i was helping. Despite how much the field took from me i woke up every day with the feeling that some sort of God or higher power had given me this mission. That it was much more than myself and so with motivation i woke every day ready to “save the world” one person at a time”. It felt good to feel like life had a meaning. To be unable to do it anymore has me so lost. Who am I now? The things i used to identify by i havent done for years nor have any interest in, my true personality is masked by symptoms causing me to act differently. What sort of life am I supposed to live now when i want for nothing else? I dont just feel lost, i feel utterly broken. Im not sure what to do but take my meds go to therapy and find hobbies as my doc has instructed..it all feels fucking pointless. I feel like i turned my back on the world. And yet ironically feel like its turned its back on me.

b4wpce,My brother keeps invalidating my trauma by saying “they [abuser]did the best they could!”,"My brother keeps invalidating my trauma by saying “they [abuser]did the best they could!”

I [26/F] think my brother [27/M] is in the denial phase about the trauma we experienced as children by being raised by a narcissistic mother and an autistic father with sexual deviance. Covert sexual abuse and emotional incest occurred between my dad and I and my mom was very abusive to me because she saw me as the other woman. As a result, My brother ended up feeling neglected and not cared for especially by my dad. 

Last year after a family therapy session, my brother became supportive because he started to see the abuse I was talking about all along. He became angry and distant from my parents. But then recently, he started seeing a new therapist and now he is all like, “you went through the abuse. That’s your story not mine. Mom and dad treated me well. I feel bad for distancing myself from them now I am going to try to be a better son.” Now he sticks up for mom and dad whenever I bring up the trauma they caused me and he is quick to say, “they did the best they could!” It just sounds like he is in denial. Which I relate to because I’ve been through that phase while grieving. But yeah it is so invalidating when he says that. True people are doing the best they can, but at the same time, they can do better. I worry he will end up in abusive relationships where he is quick to brush off what people did because “they are doing the best they can” especially when they person is not holding themselves accountable and is not changing for the better. 

Ugh, anyone else relate?",journey1992,2019-03-24 07:08:14,4,314,35.6,77.77,45.89,2.75,17.44,14.97,94.27,60.19,20.06,17.2,8.28,0.32,0.64,3.5,4.46,2.87,6.05,12.74,10.19,4.78,8.6,1.27,16.88,6.05,5.1,1.91,0.64,0.64,10.19,3.82,6.37,0.32,2.55,0.64,19.11,5.41,0,1.91,6.69,10.51,2.23,2.23,0.96,0.64,1.59,2.87,3.82,0.96,1.59,0.96,1.59,0,0.64,0.96,0,7.64,2.87,2.87,3.18,2.55,0.32,4.78,9.87,0.96,11.46,1.27,3.82,6.37,0.32,0.32,0.32,0.32,0,0.32,0.96,0,0,0.32,0.64,0,15.29,4.46,2.55,0,0,0.32,0.96,0,3.18,0.64,0,3.18

b4xkj5,The movie “Us” and PTSD,"*spoilers* 

Jordan Peele’s latest horror movie Us has been getting a lot of attention for its social commentary centered around the United States but after watching it all I could think was that it was all a big metaphor for PTSD. The two versions of oneself, before the trauma and after the trauma, trying desperately to get the old one back. Fighting your fears (the tethered), recognizing triggers (like 11:11), and even the paranoia that comes with the ending scene, it was so relatable. Watching it felt like someone was showing me exactly what it was like to struggle with PTSD and despite being a horror movie it was almost comforting.",rowan_121,2019-03-24 08:30:14,6,117,81.21,69.6,14.04,1,23.4,19.66,87.18,54.7,14.53,5.13,1.71,1.71,0.85,0.85,0,9.4,10.26,13.68,8.55,4.27,5.13,0,15.38,4.27,5.98,0.85,3.42,2.56,8.55,0.85,7.69,5.13,0.85,0,5.98,0,0,0,0,12.82,3.42,0.85,0.85,3.42,2.56,1.71,3.42,2.56,0,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,6.84,2.56,0.85,1.71,1.71,0,6.84,3.42,0,9.4,0.85,3.42,5.98,0,2.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,16.24,3.42,4.27,0.85,0,0,0,0,1.71,0.85,3.42,1.71

it's so weird like why does an arbitrary day carry so much weight? it isn't even the right day since it happened at 4am, so it'd technically happened then. on the first year anniversary it was my senior prom and i got to the house to take pictures and before we could i cried so much and dissociated and they all left to go. i ended up getting my shit together, my mom took me to the prom instead and despite only a little makeup im glad i went. but that's still a bad memory that i have to bring up too

b538vz,My Partners Friend Reminds Me Of My Attacker,"TW: R*pe mention

Hi, I have never posted here so please tell me if i’m doing this wrong. I’m literally crying on a bus right now and my friends are busy and I don’t know where to go. 

I was really brutally drugged and r*ped by someone I thought was a friend 4 years ago and developed C-PTSD from my attack. I have been in treatment since it happened and most of it is under control, but a huge new trigger has came up and I don’t know how to handle it.

My partner recently made a new friend and the resemblance is uncanny. I felt my stomach sink when i first met him. He looks and acts just like the man who hurt me. I told my partner I did not like him (which is true, he is not a great person to begin with and he gives me a horrible feeling.
) and they did not really acknowledge it. 

Anyways, fast forward to now, i’m having panic attacks on my way home because they are hanging out at my house (we live together) and I can’t handle seeing his face. I just really don’t know what to do because I don’t want to have to deal with anymore. Is it fair to bring all this up to my partner and ask if they can not be friends with him anymore?

b53nqc,Need input: are some partners toxic?,"I have posted here before.  I delete my posts often - don’t want to read them after a while.

I am having some conflicts with my partner - all stemming from a sexual assault that occurred about 4 years ago.  

I recently experienced my first public trigger - about a week ago.  It was during an event for my SO, and when I tried to get out of a crowded and loud bar because I was becoming overwhelmed I was told that I was “ruining” the event for them, even though I was trying to be discreet and isolate myself and my feelings of being overwhelmed.

A year ago, when I first shared the details of my assault, my partner reacted...poorly.  They became angry and suggested that I “look for a new place to live.”  That, coupled with a new job opportunity, I relocated out of state and essentially stopped communicating my issues with my SO.  I don’t think their intentions were bad, but as I am unpacking the enormity of what happened to me, I am digging through some old stuff.  This is what I landed on, and this is why I’m here.

During that time my partner has been working furiously on stuff related to work.  I didn’t want to burden them with my pain, and had limited access to mental health professionals to deal with my issues.  Flash forward to recently, and my partner didn’t even think that going to a town associated with my attack could be a cause of my issues.

Now I’m sitting here, the evening before my first appointment with a trauma therapist, and I need to know:  is my partner toxic?  Not in the classical sense, but in the sense that a plant may not be toxic to some, but toxic to a pet.  Their inherent nature is not designed to be emotionally supportive of someone dealing with the long term issues of sexual violence, the shame, and all the emotional vomit that comes from it.

I feel like I have been apologizing non stop the last week for what happened, and there has been almost nothing from my partner in the way of support for me.  I feel adrift in my own emotional vomit, and unable to rely on them.  

Any input is appreciated, and don’t assume the traditional gender roles on this one.

I’ve become super paranoid that he doesn’t actually care about me and is just manipulating me to fit into his life.

Right now for me it feels like the world has stopped. I feel completely empty and everything feels like it’s slowed down. 

I feel like everyone thinks I’m a loser and nobly cares I exist. I feel like every single person is out living life and I could disappear and I wouldn’t matter. 

I feel like I’m on another planet, my brain just doesn’t work. I can’t think clearly at all. 

I feel like I’m looking through a dirty window with eyes that have sunken into my skull. 

I feel like the world has destroyed me and I’m so worthless that I agree with them.

b57sxo,"I think I might be forgetting something important, but I don’t know what.","TW: mention of assault, surgery and bleeding, and miscarriage.
This is gonna be a weird one, and my thoughts are a bit tangled in my head but hopefully I can explain it well enough. 

I am terrified of rape. Terrified. Way beyond what is a healthy dose of fear. I think about how afraid I am all the time. I get crazy anxious when someone is even just near me and walking the same direction. It’s worse with older men who leer, I know that much. That just instantly makes me afraid and uncomfortable. In fact in work once I got a burn, I’m so friendly with the first aider in real life, and he took me to the first aid room and I felt this wave of fear grab me, and he said he was leaving the door open so I felt safe, it’s standard practice, but I was relieved instantly, and annoyed I’d even been afraid. 

I’ve not been raped. I have been groped, assaulted etc. But not raped. And it’s never been violent when it’s happened.

Last year my baby passed in the womb and I needed surgery. Surgery went very, very wrong. I was in so much pain and completely fetal, and blood was pouring out of me. This triggered PTSD. And is particularly worse when I see bleeding from myself ie periods. 

My fear of rape/assault has only got worse since the PTSD started. I recently went to a specialist miscarriage grief therapist, and it’s shaken loose some feelings and fears. She’s under the impression there’s more trauma in my life I’ve suppressed, and maybe that’s why I’ve kind of fractured and got PTSD from that surgery. 

I don’t know. I just feel like there’s something important I’m forgetting. The therapist specialises in pregnancy etc so can’t help with this. I feel like I would remember something happening if it’s really bad, and part of me’s just imagining it all or whatever. No clue what I hope to get from saying this. Advice, maybe? For someone to tell me to grow up and get over it? No clue.

b58byf,Sharing Thoughts,"I had Rapid On-set Psychosis back in November of 2017. I would have severe psychotic episodes almost everyday for 2 and a half months. My delusions destroyed my relationship, my thought process even to this day, and ripped through my self esteem. Some people don't realize just how scarring this stuff is they think; oh, you recovered that's good now you're normal again and stuff. In all honesty though you never recover from mental scars this deep you can only move on, and try your best to rationalize thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

with that said I'd like to share some experiences I've had post brain injury.

I was sitting at a table at work with some guys I didn't know too well just chatting, when one of them for seemingly no reason said something about Paris. (we were talking about skiing so it was very out of place(theres no skiing in paris)) just the smallest thing but it kinda triggered some memories. I just had this overwhelming feeling to fucking run and just go, I was screaming internally. I struggled to make any response to him, he might have been thrown off at my darting glance towards him as he spoke the word Paris. I won't get into why Paris is a bit of a soft spot for me especially talk about going to Paris as it is very much TMI. But it is completely irrational and that's a fact.

I have not been diagnosed with PTSD, I am in touch with plenty of doctors however though I don't like to share much with them. I am sure I don't have PTSD aswell but I can get pretty close to the feeling of it I think. Much of what I feel however is impossible to explain as it is mostly deep in my mind. At times the feelings can be absuredly euphoric feelings, I can only describe as this looming gray.

b5az31,How to deliver bad news to my wife who cannot handle stress well (likely due to probable PTSD),"My wife and I have been involved in a legal conflict for while now. My wife also has a very hard time dealing with stress. She has been diagnosed with probable PTSD and has been in therapy a few times with different therapists (at my recommendation), but each time it only lasts for a few weeks before it goes wrong. Each time she ends up worse than she got in and no longer has any trust in therapists (she is continuously stressed and depressed for months after such attempts before she stabilizes). She is also unemployed due to disability and limited in the activities she can do, which adds to the problem. She is reasonably stable right now, though she still gets stressed and depressed on days (sometimes including angry outbursts) where are several tasks for her to do (and she doesn't allow me to take over because it makes her feel irrelevant). Unfortunately she is also quite isolated, and she has no people she would trust to discuss her issue/the legal issue with. She also doesn't fully speak up with her doctors because of earlier bad experiences (in her youth) and because she is worried they might contact CPS about her mental health (if that were to happen I'm afraid she might commit suicide).

The legal conflict was devastatingly stressful for her so I have taken control of the situation and basically made sure she hasn't had to deal with it at all. It has dragged on for years at this point. Originally we expected it would go in our favor, but there is now a surprising turn where at this point our lawyer essentially recommends us not to let this go to court and to make a choice: either spend thousands to delay the issue (with a tiny chance it might resolve it) or give in to our opponents (whose guts she hates with a fire that puts the fires of hell to shame) and spend tens of thousands. Obviously I cannot make this decision without informing her, but I know doing so will devastate her and make her extremely miserable for months if not longer (especially if it further drags out).

There is not going to be any good solution, but does anyone have a recommendation how I can soften the blow? Especially perspectives from people with similar mental health issues would be incredibly valuable.",throwaway6146587,2019-03-25 06:54:16,2,417,38.11,64.95,17.31,1,27.8,17.75,92.33,59.47,15.35,10.79,2.64,1.2,0,6.71,0.24,4.56,4.08,15.11,10.79,7.43,8.15,2.64,16.07,5.28,2.88,1.68,0.48,2.4,7.67,2.16,5.52,2.16,0.72,1.44,12.71,0.72,0.24,7.43,0,15.35,2.16,3.36,1.92,3.84,1.68,4.56,1.2,0,0.24,0.72,1.92,0.24,1.68,0,0,7.91,1.92,0.72,2.16,1.44,1.68,2.4,13.67,1.44,14.63,1.68,6.71,6.24,1.68,0,0,0.48,0.24,0.24,0.48,0.24,0,0,0.24,0,11.27,3.12,1.68,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,0,0.96,4.8,0.24

b5cn67,[NSFW][Possible Trigger] Need help in developing a character with PTSD,"Well, the title says it all. I know that this is a sensitive topic and a major mistake of PTSD portrayal (minor ones can be used as a plot device) means disaster for the novel that I will write.

The main character is a former soldier who has been diagnosed already with PTSD because of war from the southern part of the country. Overprotective for his family, he tends to look at any threats that might arise and hurt him and his loved ones. However, a terrorist attack at the airport made it worse, as his parents died and her sister is fighting back for her survival at the hospital. He only trusts few people, especially from the government.

Now here lies my problem, the main character will be forced to go back to the world where his own person was destroyed, in order to know the truth and give revenge to those who are responsible. Of course, violence due to war made him traumatized but he will use violence as a tool for the objective of vengeance to succeed.

Is this plot realistic at all - that the main character must use the act that traumatized him? Or not?  Tell me why. I also had to add that he will go to different places while the plot progresses and making his PTSD worse (but I read that travelling reduces PTSD symptoms showing up).

Additionally, does people with PTSD tend to be more violent and brutal when it comes to self-defense? Are they really cold to the people that they interact with? I am asking these questions as aside from making my main character a badass one, I want the reader to be sympathetic at him and paint him as an anti-hero, while immersing himself/herself on the perspective of someone who has PTSD.

If you can add what are the things that I do not know about this disorder, do it, as I'm currently researching it for my novel writing.

b5cws0,Veteran Dad,"I’m sure this will be long and convoluted as it’s a very complicated and emotional subject, but please bear with me.

My dad is an Army vet. Fourteen years ago, he did a one year tour in Iraq. He came back with severe PTSD, which is sadly pretty normal. He potentially already had PTSD from childhood abuse, plus a family history of mental illness, so the odds were stacked against him.

In the fourteen years since, he’s become an alcoholic along with many other vices and struggles. Nine years ago, a few years after retiring from the military, he was unfairly let go from a job he liked and that just crushed him again, and he’s never recovered from that either. He spent several years unemployed, then held down a factory job for a few years, but after leaving that he hasn’t been able to hold a job. He’s using a temp agency and he’ll take on a new job (usually manufacturing, which he’s honestly getting too old for) then suddenly leave after a couple weeks for any number of reasons, without seeking out a new job first. He’s had half a dozen different jobs in the last couple months. My mom works, but she can’t keep up with the bills on her own and it’s frustrating that he seems to take any reason to leave a perfectly good job, and in an irresponsible way.

As I mentioned, he drinks. The severity has fluctuated a lot over the years, but as far as I know he hasn’t been sober for any significant amount of time in years. He usually drinks nightly or almost nightly. It’s destroyed his relationship with my younger sisters. It makes them incredibly uncomfortable, and he’s incoherent while drinking and forgets any conversation he has anyway. For his birthday this last year my mom gave him his presents in the evening, and the next morning he saw them in the kitchen and was like “Oh hey, what’s this?” It was devastatingly sad. 

He has a family history of mental illness, and I know he struggles with severe depression and anxiety because of the PTSD. He drinks because of the flashbacks. He now seems to have grandiose delusions and has delusional parasitosis (he believes he has a parasite in his body despite absolutely no medical evidence and many doctors visits, a relatively rare condition). He’s religious and believes God speaks to him and that he has some kind of special relationship with special revelations. He’s even attributed his drinking to some kind of message from God. He once accused us of being manipulated by Satan when we tried to have an intervention about his alcohol abuse. It’s incredibly hard to maintain a relationship with him as he doesn’t make much sense and tends to alienate people with strange statements. 

He’s been on some medications but won’t consistently see a psychiatrist or therapist. He says they don’t understand his struggles. I get that most people wouldn’t understand what he’s going through, but many specialists are trained to help vets with PTSD. We even live near a post where he can get medical care and surely there are resources for him. He just refuses to try. 

He’s destroying his body and mind with his vices, and destroying his relationships with my family. Please understand that I’m coming at this with the utmost love and compassion for my father. I have PTSD from my own difficulties, it’s not that I don’t understand. We’re just at the end of our rope with him. We’ve considered having him admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where he could get the intensive care he probably needs, but he won’t agree to that and having him admitted without his consent is difficult. What can we do to help him? How can we convince him to get help? Maybe this is party just to get this pain off my chest, but any advice would be dearly welcome.

Tl;dr: Veteran father has severe PTSD, delusions, alcoholism. He won’t seek or accept help.

b5del5,"Meet the criteria for PTSD, but feel like what I experienced shouldn’t cause this much stress.","I’m a 22 year old female. My mom has always had significant health issues and will likely die of her diseases, although when is not clear. This is something that causes me a lot of grief and distress but I have gotten good at compartmentalizing. 

A few months ago, we learned she had a heart murmur, most likely due to a heart condition that would require surgery. At the time I worked a stressful job and had been backstabbed by my company. (80 hour work weeks, lying boss.) he wouldn’t give me time off to care for her so I quit. Then we learned it was a mitral valve prolapse, and she definitely needed surgery. 

My mom has a personality disorder and has emotionally abused me at times throughout my life, especially when she’s stressed. So during this time she ostracized and bullied me, and banned me from going to the hospital for her surgery. 

In this time she kicked me out for 2 weeks. I stayed with two shitty people who did shitty things. I also got a horrible stomach virus (we all did) and got to a point where I thought I may need to get IV fluids. I have health anxiety so this was really hard for me. I ended up coming back after those 2 weeks. 

I got updates from my dad while she was hospitalized, there were a couple times it was touch and go and they thought it might be time to say goodbye, but she pulled through. Every night I was scared to sleep for fear that she would be dead when I woke up. Gradually I began eating and sleeping less, until one day, a couple weeks or so after her surgery, I didn’t eat or sleep for 3 days. Two doses of Ativan in the ER made no effect. I had a psychotic episode (I’m assuming?) that I don’t remember in which I physically fought the nurses and cussed out my friend. They gave me haloperidol and knocked me out. 

I was put in psych for 3 days in a terrible psych hospital where I received no therapy. The MD met with me once and said I have PTSD, but he thinks it’s from an experience I had as a teenager. 

Backstory on that: my freshman year of high school, I pissed a girl off and she and her friends cornered me and tried to beat me up. I don’t remember much of it, the adrenaline was in overdrive. The only mark on my body was a bleeding cut above my eye from being thrown onto a table. 

It was about 6 months after that that I began having constant panic attacks. Anxiety and depression deeply colored the next 4 years, as did benzo addiction. 

However, I never felt fear when I recalled the event. I had no flashbacks or nightmares. I didn’t avoid any reminders of the event. Basically, I didn’t fit any PTSD criteria, except the anxiety and hyper vigilance. 

Now, I fit the criteria for it. 

I avoid reminders of that time period from the time my mom kicked me out until I got out of the psych ward. 
I won’t watch tv because that’s all I did (unless I’m with someone) 
My house gives me anxiety because it reminds me of being there alone and afraid. 
I am terrified to sleep alone- I’ve only slept alone in my bed a handful of times since then and it’s always so scary to me that I cry if I have to do it. 
I feel empty and like my life will never get better, I can’t see a future. 
When I’m alone I am very afraid. 
I have a loss of identity. 
I feel disconnected to most people. 
I have panic attacks almost daily. 
I struggle to feel emotion, and when I do, I’m either sobbing or wanting to die or hurt myself, I imagine stabbing myself or slitting my wrists to satisfy the urge. 

All the psychiatrists I’ve called are booked out 6 months. I have a doctor appointment this week.

b5fxcl,Telling someone I’m dating that I have ptsd?,"Warning: This post is going to have mentions of sexual assault, not in detail but I thought I’d better be safe :) 

I’ve been talking to this guy almost every day for over a month now. We get along really well and we met up last week, we’re meeting up this week again. He’s a really cool guy, but I feel as though I should mention to him that I was recently diagnosed with ptsd, after being sexually assaulted in June of last year. I think it’s important he knows as I’ve found I can’t share a room with a man the first couple of times I’m there as I get physically sick, vomit shake uncontrollably etc.. after a while I can get used to it and trust, and I’m okay. I’m also okay with having sex as long as they ask before initiating and aren’t too pushy, it doesn’t freak me out really at all. This is probably because of the circumstances of my assault rather than anything else. I don’t know how to tell this to him and make it clear that i don’t think he’s a rapist, or that he’d do anything to me, that it’s my body reacting to something that’s happened to me. I also don’t know how to even bring it up. Does anyone have any advice on this?

b5g7b9,How do I get through my boyfriend’s upcoming graduation?,"My boyfriend graduates from college in a little over a month. He informed me that we are going to have about 20 people over at our apartment (all his family that I’ve never met). I’m really not great in crowds or large groups of people that I don’t know, but I obviously have/want to be there for his graduation. I tried to see if we could just meet at the restaurant and then just all head over to the graduation, without the unnecessary step of having all these people come to our tiny one bedroom apartment for an hour or two to do nothing in between lunch and the ceremony. But his mom insists, and I’m just having so much anxiety over it. She says people can just come in and out from by the pool so it’ll be fine but we still are just going to have to try to entertain people for an hour or two?  

So I guess I need some interesting ways to get a few moments of solitude when I need it.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys,

It's been almost 2 years since I was with him and I had a 6 month break before getting into another relationship, but it wasn't enough to make it go away. I used to think it was ""normal"" what I was experiencing - that I was going through the motions of a break-up, but recently I've been starting to think something else is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

I first noticed something strange, when my boyfriend and I were having a tickle fight. I flinched backwards to avoid being tickled and I hit my head against the wall a little bit. I remember in that moment, instantly seeing a past scene of when my boyfriend had punched me in the head. I didn't remember him punching me initially, but instead the moment after this when I was standing against the wall feeling the lump on my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things started happening similar to this. I used to argue with my ex boyfriend all the time and yes I felt numb sometimes, but I would argue back now and again. However, when my boyfriend had our first argument I noticed something strange - I felt very panicky, my hands were covered in sweat, my heart was racing and I couldn't speak - it wasn't that I was scared of him - I knew logically I had nothing to be afraid of, but I felt terrified and it was as if I went back to that moment with my ex boyfriend before things would escalate. Memories start flooding back when this happens, but they're not life like - as if I'm there, just memories.

&amp;#x200B;

I started having nightmares after this, they weren't exact memories of the past - sometimes my boyfriend played the part of my ex and sometimes my boyfriend's mother played the part of my ex's mother. I would wake up sweating and my heart pounding sometimes and be off for the rest of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

I also had forgotten some things which you'd think a person would never forget. It wasn't until I read a diary entry I'd written 6 months prior to an event that I instantly remembered the time he dragged me across the floor picked me up and slapped me because I was being too emotional about my dad dying - I still feel like this was my fault and I deserved to be slapped - he told me he done it to ""snap me out of it""

&amp;#x200B;

3 months after the break up I developed a panic disorder which I thought was to do with my fear of death, but I'm starting to think maybe it is to do with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I talk about it I get shaky - I don't even feel scared or traumatised, but my body is acting as if there's a threat it's strange.

&amp;#x200B;

A big part of me believes that it's just anxiety and all in my head - after all, my ex bf had PTSD and what I'm going through looks nothing like his. He would have flashbacks where he would completely zone out and that doesn't happen to me. I also don't really avoid talking about it - I can talk about it, but it does set my panic off most times.

&amp;#x200B;

I  will be starting CBT soon for the panic attacks, but how do I go about dealing with this? My guidance counsellor at uni asked me about my past relationships and this came up, I told her about the memories and the tickle fight instance, but she didn't question further. Does this mean I don't need support for it? I'm not sure what to do, I weirdly feel ashamed to be asking for help because I feel like it's not as bad as what other people have been through.

&amp;#x200B;

All I know is that I'm going through something which takes control over me and I want control back. It's really getting in the way of having a normal relationship.

b5k0oh,Retrigging because guy refused to leave after entering business afterwards. Hard to think right now. I could use words of support.,"I’m going to try to write this as well as I can. 

A guy came into the coffee shop tonight after close and was refusing to leave. I got real serious with him real fast. The music was playing loudly. He came in and I informed him we were closed. He delayed and didn’t leave. I turned the music off and informed him, that we were closed and he needs to leave. Failure to leave is considered trespassing. He kept delaying. Trying to ask me questions. Blaming me for the fact he was able to get in. 

I told him he was being recorded and was on camera. He didn’t move. I decided to get my phone to call 911 and my pepper spray. I said, “you know what!” and walked over to get it. He asked, “are you going to shoot me? You don’t have to be so crazy. You’ve got a problem.” 

I rolled my eyes and said it was pepper spray and then started walking towards him. He started to leave. I didn’t care if it was sprayed indoors (that was probably poor thinking). As he was in the doorway, and I was getting closer to the door, I started counting down, “3,2,1.”, got to the door, closed it and locked the deadbolt. He was still standing there. Just looking in. 

It was retriggering for me. I’ve had to file criminal charges against a sexual harasser/trespasser in Sept 2016, and a stalker in 2018. Both incidents happened at my business. I’ve been in trauma therapy since December of 2016. We’ve done some EMDR around the crimes, the resulting criminal trials, the investigations of the trials. It just goes on and on.

The business was burglarized last May and as a result, we got cameras and adopted better money handling practices. 

Anyway, I’m so damn weary!! Do I, like, have a sign on my back that says, “please, fuck with her.”

I mean, I have words. I have boundaries. It’s unacceptable for someone to refuse to leave when asked. Why am I constantly having to do it. 

And WHY is my kind of PTSD so hard to describe? All I can tell for sure is that I’m retriggered when I have authority, and use it, and men refuse. It’s like they are abusing their power. I cannot put my finger on it. 

And you know what sucks, unlike someone who is triggered by gunshots and avoids fireworks, I just don’t know what to avoid? I’ve been isolating, outside of work, for a few months now because I don’t know what to avoid. 

I appreciate ANY wisdom or support here.

Since then, I feel like I’ve been on the road to a full backslide. My depression symptoms are heightened, my anxiety is crazy high, and my thoughts towards myself are so negative and destructive.

Now it’s like, I can hear arguing mostly, particularly my mom screaming and It scares the shit out of me and makes me feel deeply disturbed. This especially happens if there is white noise, like if I have my space heater on the constant fan noise is going and suddenly I have to turn it off and check if around even though this will be so late at night and nothing is actually happening. Another thing that happens to me is that when I am dissociating sometimes the floor looks like it’s waving slightly, if that makes sense, imagine the floor is actually water and that’s what it can look like to me sometimes. I’d imagine these things might be because of my c-ptsd? Have any of you experienced this? It’s not something I got to ask in therapy, I was mostly trying to focus on my symptoms that make it hard to function in public with my therapist.

b5saqu,Got My Official Diagnosis Today,"I had to fill out some paperwork at work for FMLA so I can have my therapy visits approved for 3 times a month. My therapist had to designate what my diagnosis was and if untreated, how it could affect my work. Seeing the diagnosis was strange to me. If you're not sure what those codes before it is, they're ICD-10 codes - basically how it's coded for insurance.

    F43.10 PTSD
    F32.9 Unspecified depressive disorder
    F41.9 Unspecified anxiety disorder
    Increased anxiety
    Depression
    Dissociation when experiencing increased stress.

Does anyone feel like dealing with their condition makes everything else seem surreal? Sometimes I could be in the middle of watching a movie, I don't feel like my body is my own.

b5ub06,I think I’m in denial. I’m so confused and it hurts. I don’t believe what my psychiatrist diagnosed. Please help,"I got my diagnosis last month and I’m still battling with myself 

I was referred to this specialist because of bipolar that runs in my family. My mother is certain I have bipolar but I don’t believe I do. 

From a young age my father was abusive, mentally, emotionally and physically. I have reoccurring blips of like paranoia following a trigger, I have nightmares most nights. I’ve actually made my knuckles bleed during my sleep because I kept punching my wall (I have strong antidepressants that knock me out cold). 

My best friend is 41 he served in the British Paramilitary during the Ireland troubles in the 90s. He saw his best mate get blown to bits, completely vaporised. He stopped his father and Uncle from killing themselves with a sawn off and a lot more. 

He has ptsd, understandably.

I just don’t get it, how do I have ptsd. I don’t think I do sometimes and then others I do. It makes it hard to talk about depending on my mood etc. 

I just don’t get it, I’m a though person and I don’t get effected emotionally very much. My sisters are all younger and they witnessed the abuse my father gave me and my mother. 

I don’t get it, it just makes this life feel so dark and bitter. I sometimes feel like walking to the bridge near me, downing a bottle of Jack Daniels and walking off it into the river below once I’m drunk. 

This life is so random, meaningless, futile and unfortunate that we all came about. I mean why am I conscious just to suffer I don’t get it and I’m so confused. I don’t feel like I’m in my body sometimes I feel like I’m in third person watching myself like I’m in a film or something. 

Is there anyone out there that I can relate to? Is there anyone out there who is lost and lonely like me?

b5w3hx,I am very sure I have post traumatic stress disorder,"Hi all, I hope all is well. I’m not a believer in self diagnosis but I can make an educated inference as to what I might be going through.  

It started four years ago. I was thirteen years old when I was in a bad car accident, I know that a small percentage of auto wreck survivors do develop PTSD. Anyways I was in the car with my mom, sister, and brother. We were on a minivan so I sat in the seat behind the front on the right hand side by the side door. I received direct impact when a small sudan sped through and ran a red light (the driver was under the influence). 

I remember the accident like it was yesterday, I remember the headlights and the scream of twisting metal. The shattering glass as the entire window to my right was blown to bits. The force that without my seatbelt would have thrown me into my brother. I saw a flash of light, and what was only seconds felt like forever. 

The accident involved three cars; ours, the one that hit us after running the light, and another car that we smashed into. The impact on us was so strong the car was thrown around and hit another car facing opposite to traffic. Witnesses told us they couldn’t believe our car didn’t flip over. 

I remember taking my hands away from my head and seeing them covered in blood, my brother screamed in horror because of the several red streams flowing down my face. Two large chunks of glass cut into my forehead, leaving a scar that is still very visible today. A few people pulled over and came to our car with first aid kits and napkins and even water. People can be good to you if you’re in trouble. I was shaking a lot, but I managed to get out of my seat after brushing all of the glass out of my lap. 

The EMT that cleaned me up was real nice. He was able to remove one of the pieces of glass from me by himself. (The other piece of glass wouldn’t be removed until a month later, the doctor in the ER made a mistake). They asked me if I wanted to take the ambulance. I said no, largely because I knew that taking the ambulance would be very costly and I was for the most part fine.

We went to the ER in my aunts car. We waited three hours for a doctor. He did nothing but put surgical glue in my cut and bandage it up, my mother wasn’t with me. 

Two weeks later and several sympathy cards later, the swelling in the areas cut by glass on my forehead wouldn’t go down. I went to my family doctor to find out a piece of glass was embedded under the skin due to the ER’s carelessness. Two weeks later I was back in the hospital for surgery. 

School had started by that time. My classmates wished me luck with surgery, but I wasn’t feeling so good about it. I was awake the whole time, under local anesthesia. I actually preferred that without even knowing the alternative. I had stitches and was free to go within the hour. 

Now I’m going to backtrack a bit to the days after the accident. Any time I thought we were in “danger” I would duck, flinch, or grab my ears, or do all the above. I would do this several times in the car. Four years later, I still do. I’m eighteen now, just a few days ago I found myself in the same panic position, trying to protect myself. Sometimes I do it and it’s actually because someone on the road did something risky, but most times I am not any risk at all. 
 
The first year after the accident, I would flinch in the car often. I also grew to be very irritable and short tempered. I hated loud noises, and I would sometimes “flashback”- not exactly, but the moment of collision might spontaneously go through my head and make me kind of spaz out (sorry if that’s not a good way to describe it) 

Freshman year of high school a major agitation to my problems would occur. In basketball practice I ripped open one of the wounds again. I was driving for a lay up and got knocked off my feet, my head slammed into the floor before t e rest of my body. I was seeing stars. After that I was forced to look at myself in the mirror of the bathroom as my face was covered in blood all over again from a wound that should have been healed for a year. Apparently I tore a facial muscle in the car accident and for over a year it never repaired, causing the cut to just rip open. I was back in the ER, a surgeon actually stitched my muscle back together then closed the forehead wound for good. My irritability sky rocketed after that, the memories of the accident a year prior came back with a vengeance. 

For the next two years I would continue to have my issues with being in the car. Then I began learning to drive. I hated it, I don’t anymore. But I don’t like it. I actually passed my test on the first try (woo hoo???) But I would and still do get anxiety about driving, and I kind of defer the driving burden to my twin sister who loves driving. I still flinch in the car, mainly I cover my ears, that sound of the impact is something I never want to hear ever again. 

On top of my issues with the accident, I am very upset by blood, hospital settings and other things. In a health class we watched a documentary on concussions and how they can be debilitating. They should a football player getting absolutely decked and being pulled off the field and going to the ER. He needed surgery and all these other things and I swear to god I started crying, breathing heavily and just reliving the indescribable feeling of the collision as it went through my head in the car as well as the pain of smashing my head into the court floor during practice. 

I am in an anatomy class now, and I still get very uncomfortable with watching surgeries. We watched a brain surgery and I told the teacher I needed to look away because I noticed my breathing was getting short and I was getting worked up. She’s understanding, I try to stomach watching the procedures because they are interesting, today we had a field trip to go see a kidney transplant live- I didn’t go, I figured it would be better for my sake. Last week we observed a lung transplant only in a video, but the doctors and the surgeons and the room was making me “remember” so I looked away. 

Also after both incidents, my grades plummeted and only recovered at very very slow rates. I was irritable, had the events play over and over in my head. I still love with the aversions to driving, being in a car in general, medical stuff. It’s strange because I’m so “strong” otherwise (I know people with ptsd aren’t weak, I’m just saying things don’t bother me outside of those things). I became extremely depressed as well, I even got on antidepressants, I had some dark thoughts, and my brain was pretty much... mush. 

I am a lot better now. I still live some  mental repercussions. It’s just looking back and now I am learning about mental health disorders in school in great detail, and I am very understanding of my own experiences with mental health and needing help, and I wonder if I have this, considering doctors do have a hard time diagnosing disorders. I had a lot of bad luck, but it’s ok. Thank you so much for taking the time to read, I know it’s a lot.

b5yfxk,I’m at a dead end [NSFW],"So... it’s 3:06 in the morning. I don’t know what else to do so I thought I’d write here. I can’t sleep. I can’t remember the last time I slept properly, without nightmares. I’ve had massive anxiety all day long. I’ve had it -once again- for the past few weeks, but I’ve kinda just pushed it aside... You know, happy thoughts and everything’s dandy, right? 
Well today (yesterday if you wanna nitpick) something triggered it good and I can’t stop shaking, crying, feeling like I need to run away. Drenched in cold sweat. The goddamn fear. It’s killing me.
I’m terrified, nonstop, for no reason. I don’t know what I’m afraid of, but it’s the kind of fear that can drive you insane. It squeezes my throat and my heart, I keep heaving and retching and hyperventilating. I jump at every sudden move or sound. My mind’s a mess. My thoughts run in a circle and I hate myself for being like this. I want to hurt myself just because the physical pain is so much easier to handle.
I called the psych center, they gave me sedatives that ease the physical symptoms (by making me feel heavy and sleepy; yet I can’t sleep) but do nothing to the fear and self-hate.
I’m wait-listed for intensive psychotherapy (trauma therapy) and all I can do is wait.
I’ve had PTSD diagnosis for years, but now that things have really gotten out of hand, I still need to wait.
It’s just... I don’t know how long I can take this. I have my past haunting me every moment and this constant lack of sleep combined with the senseless dread... I have a weak heart and it’s not taking it too well. 
My relationship is strained, too... My SO tries to understand and tries to help, but I can tell it’s getting on his nerves. Plus the fact that I apparently can’t have sex right now. I want to, but when he touches me I just freeze and start crying. I can’t control it and it makes me feel even worse and cry even more. He says it’s okay, but I feel so damn guilty for pushing him away like that. I don’t want him to think I don’t want him. I long for intimacy, but this thing is getting in the way.

I went to the hospital Monday because I feared for my safety and by all accounts it wasn’t pretty. I haven't been seen by my or any psychiatrist in almost 5 months due to constantly rescheduled appointments. I always seem to find out on the day, and it's now been at least 5 reschedules and I can barely keep it together

I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar II as well previously, so some continuity of care is important. I still get psychologist appointments, and some counselling, but my meds desperately need reviewing because things are getting far worse since disclosing childhood sexual assault by my twin brother from 8-16 years old.

b5zfix,Feeling numb after a ptsd episode,"Some context: I was violently raped and abused by a couple men when I was in high school over the course of a few years. I went through lots of therapy that helped a lot and my life has completely turned around. My boyfriend has been a constant support for me, however we were apart for a few months and it has left me feeling like he will leave again, even if it's irrational.

I hadn't had a PTSD episode in months, and at their worst, I had visual and auditory hallucinations, I was completely convinced that I was back in that basement. Last weekend after a drunk argument with my boyfriend I became terrified he was going to ask me to leave and he was going to break up with me. That started the cycle in my brain which eventually pushed me too far down the rabbit hole. Tunnel vision, heart beating out of my chest. I thought I was back being hurt again, something I hadn't felt in months.
The next morning, I woke up feeling nothing. I was completely numb. I've felt this way in the past, but something always kicks me out of it fast and I usually feel a flood of emotions that end with optimism, a goal for progress and love for the man I'm with who helped me through it all. This time is different.
I don't feel angry, or sad, or happy, or depressed, or motivated. I feel nothing. I'm completely numb. It's been a couple days, and I've slowed down a little at work. I get things done but the spark isn't there. I feel drained of all my energy. I DO NOT feel depressed, this is more an absence of any feeling whatsoever. I get to see my boyfriend again next weekend but I've lost all my sex drive as well and I don't want him to take it personally. I just don't feel anything.
Any advice? Anybody have similar stories/experiences?

b5zhby,"EMDR, Horrible nightmares, feel exhausted.","I've been going to my EMDR therapist for almost 2 years now. It was all trust building and working up to EMDR. Yesterday we started EMDR for one of the traumatic events, the slightly less gruesome one if you will. I didn't get very far and had to stop but afterward I thought I was fine for a bit. I went to bed at night and ended up having the most horrific nightmares. One my husband woke me up from. But after he went to work I had another. I usually have nightmares, generally replaying of the event, or some other fucked up version of it, or something kinda symbolic of my state of mind etc. You probably understand. These yesterday were so bad though and so intense and now I'm afraid to sleep. I don't understand why this happened. Ill put what the dreams were below as I record my dreams to discuss in therapy etc. 
 •(Day after EMDR) Horrible night of nightmares. In the dream I shot up heroin, started dying, and fell into a hole. Kept dropping until there was fire and demons that at first looked like the people but as I fell closer they changed into devils with red skin and bright green eyes and had tons of sharp teeth. Husband  woke me up right as I was about to land on them. 

In the second dream I accidentally shot the neighbors porch light out with a bb gun. Then the police came, found the bulb, and then we're searching everywhere for the bullet. When they found it, it had went through their window somehow but it wasn't the one I shot. The cop was holding a straight up shotgun slug. Husband also got arrested and then they arrested me. They took him. He kept apologizing and saying I'll make it. I can't talk about the rest of the dream.

Would like to make note I've never shot up heroin, nor do have i ever been in trouble with the cops, nor do I act or intend to act irresponsibly or violently with guns. 

Idk I'm just afraid to sleep even more now and I don't want to do EMDR anymore if this is the result. Anxiety was severe all day, Ive been on edge and paranoid. I feel like shit and it's exhausting and scary.",theflexorcist,2019-03-26 20:32:07,2,396,47.81,20.24,91.64,1,13.66,14.9,89.39,56.57,15.4,11.36,8.08,0.51,0.51,0.76,1.52,4.04,5.56,15.15,8.84,5.81,10.1,2.27,17.93,4.8,2.78,0.76,1.77,2.27,6.31,1.01,5.3,1.77,0.76,0,6.06,0.76,0.25,0,1.52,11.87,1.77,1.52,1.01,3.79,1.26,4.55,3.54,1.77,0.25,1.26,3.03,1.52,1.26,0.25,0,7.32,1.52,0.76,3.28,0.76,1.01,10.1,7.58,1.52,16.67,2.27,7.32,7.07,0.76,1.26,1.01,0,0.51,0.25,1.26,0.51,0.76,0,0,0.25,14.65,7.32,3.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.03,0.51,0.25

I love it and it’s fun and one of my best calls that I consider fun because I got to do my job. I’m realizing that it’s not me feeling the bones in her pelvis slip that bothered me but it was the fact that someone else in my company was negligent and injured this person and my company sent me there as an EMT to fix it and to make it all worse this lady sued my company but I was never brought to court so they must have settled out of court and probably paid her not enough money. I kinda feel like this issue was never resolved properly because of it. It’s very disturbing to me that a healthcare company I worked for injured someone and there isn’t a day that I don’t think about it. I also get extremely upset at times like almost irrationally, like if I get asked how I deal with stress at a job interview or something, it’s very hard for me to answer and I start to get emotional because my whole family has decided they can’t hear my stories anymore at first they would listen but it started getting difficult for them.

b5zu6f,Has anyone else worked in Greek refugee camps?,"Hi there,

Just wondering if anyone else here has volunteered for aid work in the Greek Refugee camp called Moria, or any other place like it. I did go to Moria in early 2017 and, while I've gotten therapy and help, the few weeks I spent there have stuck with me nonetheless, albeit not as strongly as last year. It at least seems like there really isn't an online or IRL community of aid workers from that area/situation, despite my counselor telling me how many people she treated per week who were involved in aid work from this part of the world (according to her estimate, close to a 3rd of her clients).

Are there others like me?

b607pa,Trauma?,"Actually looking for a trauma therapist right now so I'm ahead of anybody that gives that advice, just to let you know. But since i don't know how long that will take i thought I'd get some advice from people who have been there.

I was actually diagnosed with PTSD a decade ago, and have been advised to apply for disability because of the deterioration of my mental health. Things have been rather... Erratic lately and I'm worried that i may have been exposed to a new trauma.

I just got my divorce finalized 21 days ago. I filed, and he sabotaged my efforts to finalize which delayed the whole process. He's been more overbearing and controlling, his friends have taken it upon themselves to report back any activity of mine they witness. I believe he didn't prompt it but it's still pretty creepy and violating. My abandonment issues are running amok, which is weird because I'm the one leaving, however it did take two years to make this even happen as he impeded my every effort to even file until i found a way around it. 

Lately I've noticed a major shift in my moods, attitudes, responses, etc. I have rapid cycling bipolar so I'm no stranger to drastic and rapid mood swings, but they are so erratic right now that I'm easily at the point where I'm not even sure what they are. My anxiety is exacerbated to the extreme where i feel like there's absolutely no correct option in any decision I've made. I'm unable to get over things that my friends say really aren't that big a deal. And while i would agree they're not as big a deal as I'm feeling they are, it's rather unusual that i wouldn't get over things as such. My mind obsesses over it, i have nightmares.

I lost a lot of friends in this divorce. Most of them were never friends to begin with, i didn't really lose them so much as learn that lesson. But others went from helping me to just disappearing, and I've been hollered at by a few for not leaving sooner which pissed me off because when i asked for help i clearly stated i was asking for help because i felt like i was being held prisoner, which should make it clear that leaving isn't as easy as just packing and taking off. I have nowhere to go and no money to get there. The people willing to take me in can't, the people able to take me in aren't willing, and i got offered safe spaces a few times only to have them rescinded at the last second, which quite frankly is so much worse than just being told no.

In that same vein i had a friend that tried to help and said i could come to him. He listened and did his best at first. Then suddenly started ignoring me. Then basically told me caring is too inconvenient, fuck off. This hit really hard considering i have so few people in my life that treat me with any type of value that it was a visit from him where he showed me i did have value that gave me the strength to ask for divorce in the first place, that made me realize i did in fact deserve better treatment than what i was getting. So how do you get over one of the few people who showed you that they believed you have value suddenly making it clear that you're no longer worth caring about in the middle of a crisis?

And I'm so confused about that last part. On days i want to just call him up or write a letter and rip him a new one, tell him he should've left me to go through this whole thing alone. Other days i want to take all the blame and punish myself, and i can't stop crying. Other days i feel completely numb. And other days i want to ask him to please give me a chance to get my value back. All i needed was for someone to care.

One of the many reasons i got divorced was because i was being abused. I was put in sexual situations i was uncomfortable with, with people i didn't want to do things with, and when i said no my ex would hound me until i caved, then i finally just stopped saying no when i realized that wasn't an option for me. He'd associate in inappropriate ways with other girls, making it with them, dating them behind my back, discussing attraction, etc. and when i would catch him and call him out on it he'd throw these sexual situations in my face, as though he only did it to get back at me for cheating on him (he even told people i chested on him!), which wasn't fair because he set these things up and i had to go along with it, he didn't allow me a choice. He died more respect to these other women than he did me.

Other people witnessed him mistreating me, negligence, psychological abuse, verbal abuse. There a couple people that even witnessed him assaulting me and did absolutely nothing to help me. They became immersed in their comic books or booze and turned a blind eye. I honestly believes i deserved the shit i was getting.

He's impeded every effort I've made to gain independence. He offered to pay for me to go to community college, and rescinded that offer once it became clear i wasn't going to study what he wanted to study. If i needed mental health intervention he concerned himself more with the bill than my wellbeing. If i needed emergency medical care he'd tell me to call around and find someone else to take me (even at 3a), and if it came down to him taking me anyway he'd bitch at me over the inconvenience i caused him. If i was admitted to the hospital i would most of the times wind up spending my entire stay there without a single visit, and he'd only call to find out when I'm getting released or what the bill was looking like, not the least bit concerned about how i was doing.

And I'm so mixed up right now. He says i can stay here as long as i want and I'm thinking at times i should because I'll never make it without him, and other times I'm like i can't get out of here soon enough, and other times I just want to kill myself because I'm convinced that's the only way I'll escape (attempts have been made but here i am all existing against my will).

And my mental health is just deteriorating faster and faster. I'm getting more confused about what's happening in my head. I don't know why i can't get over things that should be easy to get over. Why the smallest inconvenience makes me feel like the universe hates me.

Sorry for the novel I'm just sorting through thoughts with this trying to understand but I'm not sure it makes sense. Thanks for any help.",knightofcoins,2019-03-26 21:54:14,2,1202,17.97,20.05,80.71,19.56,21.46,13.73,94.18,61.65,23.13,16.31,11.4,0,0.42,3.41,1.08,6.82,3.83,13.89,10.57,7.4,7.49,2.91,21.88,5.24,3,2.16,0.92,2.66,5.57,2.33,2.75,0.5,1.16,0.5,10.65,0.33,0.42,0.17,3.41,15.31,2.75,2.58,2.25,2.25,1.83,4.83,1.91,0.83,0.5,0.5,1.83,0.58,0.92,0.25,0.08,7.24,1.08,1.5,2.33,2.58,0.58,6.74,11.31,1,12.9,2.16,6.41,4.99,1.41,0.42,0,0.5,0,0.17,0.75,0.33,0,0.25,0,0.08,13.48,4.66,3.41,0,0,0.17,0.08,0,0,4.66,0.5,0

b63ig1,Just received my diagnosis letter,"After 6 months of tests and trials, I finally spoke to a private psychiatrist last Tuesday (UK based, the NHS failed me). At the end of the consultation he verbally diagnosed me with complex PTSD. I was relieved. I had an answer! I can start to move on!   

However, today I received the letter from the psychiatrist which has written, in black and white, ‘Diagnosis: Complex PTSD’. I already knew this but seeing it written down along with a 4 page letter detailing my abuse and my personality profile has made me feel sick. I feel shaky, obsessed and suddenly, completely alone.   

I’m taking a big step today of going to a department store with my Dad. He, along with my family and husband know the diagnosis and have been brilliant but now I feel terrified. I was feeling excited. A step forward but now I feel like crying and just staying in bed but I know that will just mean a day of hallucinations and flashbacks. I don’t know what to do. Where do I go from here? I’m so tired of being scared and tired of thinking about the past.

b65dz7,It's kind of upsetting that all PTSD surveys are made for 18+ people.,"I mean I understand that people under the age of 18 need parental/guardian consent to even participate in a study. Although, it feels like minors who suffer from PTSD are ignored. There is a stigma that only adults have PTSD and it isn't fair to those who are minors, have PTSD and are ignored. I have had PTSD since I was in third grade and I only realized in middle school.

I’m afraid when it’s time for him to come home from work because I don’t know what kind of mood he is in and I start feeling anxiety and panic.

b66qky,Anyone overcame bullying trauma?,"I feel like I still have alot of trauma from all the bullying from school, family and the workforce. The reason why it bothers me so much is not just because of the shame I felt, but because it has cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost income because I was unemployed for years because of gaps in my resume due to having to quit jobs early because of being bullied and also because it affected my social skills so interviewers thought I was unpleasant to deal with

Has anyone overcome trauma from bullying? What can help other than just seeing a counselor or therapist? 

I'm reluctant to see a therapist because my health insurance is $6100 and hasn't been towards at all yet. I've called a few therapists and they're charging $80+/hr. I'm willing to pay that only if I know it'll work and quickly because I'm very frugal. I've seen therapists in the past, and none of them really helped. They mostly just listened to my problems, were sympathetic, but didn't really offer any proactive solutions.

b69t4i,betrayal and fear?,"There’s this somewhat new friend I have.. a man in his 30s like myself... 

he was being hurtful and condescending the other day, so yesterday I told him that I don’t want to talk to him anymore, how I won’t tolerate him being that way.

He said “okay, goodbye”,

and then i replied with how there’s some divide with us, how he seems
different..

then he said “you remember that girl you asked me to text?

sure you do. 
I know all about you.

(I said he’s creeping me out)

you creep everyone out buddy.
trust me”

... and then he blocked me.

Some context; Last summer I was close with this girl for a few months, and then she backed away abruptly because she had a nasty breakup with her long time (now ex) boyfriend, and needed space from all men...
and when I tried to continue talking she blocked me...

I then asked this man to send her a text of mine to her. He doesn’t know her,
he actually doesn’t even live in the same state.

a day or two after the text was sent,
i visited her at work as a surprise... she got scared and called the police to warn me not to contact her, per her request.

She also most likely blocked my friend who texted her.

Anyways, what on earth does this mean, like what he said to me? why bring up a
text he sent to a girl like 4 months ago? why say he “knows all about me”?

those are scary things to say to someone.

b6b14y,Why did I dream about enjoying sex with my rapist?,Long story short. I was drugged and raped. I don’t remember much of it but I usually always have repetitive dreams of me being trapped in either a scary basement or a scary attic with the guy and I find myself being nice to him in the dream so that he doesn’t hurt me. Usually every time I see a crack in an exit door so I try to run for it but he always catches me every time. It makes me sick just talking about it. Anyways this dream I had last night was like no other. I had a dream about me having sex with my rapist but I was actually enjoying it. Idk why I dreamt this but i remember feeling aroused. I woke up hating myself. I’m not sure why I would have that dream but it’s making me so sick. ,idkidk122,2019-03-27 15:49:35,4,155,7.97,1.25,98.93,1.23,14.09,10.32,96.77,63.23,25.81,18.71,16.77,0,0,1.94,0,7.1,4.52,10.32,10.32,9.03,7.1,3.23,18.06,4.52,1.29,1.94,0,2.58,8.39,2.58,5.81,1.29,2.58,0.65,3.87,0,0.65,0,2.58,18.06,2.58,3.23,0.65,2.58,3.23,6.45,1.94,0.65,0,1.29,5.81,0.65,1.94,3.87,0,1.29,0,0.65,0.65,0,0,5.81,7.1,0,11.61,0.65,5.16,5.81,0,4.52,0.65,0,0,0,1.29,0,0.65,0,0,1.29,9.68,6.45,0,0,0,0.65,0,0,0,2.58,0,0
b6c3if,People don’t get it.,"I just told my sister that I was diagnosed with PTSD yesterday and went on to tell her the events that I think caused it. She didn’t really say anything and then just randomly brought up how she’s craving chocolate...So I went really? That’s all you have to say? And she goes you don’t talk about anything else and it’s hard to listen to after awhile. I told her she just doesn’t understand and she said she doesn’t and the conversation ended there.

It’s so frustrating and the perceived criticism I got from that interaction makes me want to cry. I know I have emotional instability and hypervigilance, but it hurts still. My trauma literally is the only thing I talk about...I feel like if I were to be put into a social situation I’d have nothing to offer conversation-wise. And I know there’s this inner critic making me feel this shame. I have been out of the abusive relationship for 9 months now and feel so stuck and frozen in my mind. Sorry for venting.

b6cp9v,A poem about my experience.,"Hi everyone,

I've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. 

I developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all. This week has been particularly hard for me, and I think writing this poem has helped a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The World was a Different Place.** 

*A demon laughed* 

*at me while I* 

*begged my Father not to fire.*

*The lights were off.*

*Alone in the dark,*

*I battled the night.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The womb of reality burst*

*when the gun fired and an*

*ungodly scream*

*came through me*

*and my Father swayed,*

*a tortured tranquility in him*

*before he fell to the ground.*

*The pitch black pistol*

*falling into the chair beside his body,*

*aimed down to the hell*

*that possessed him.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*Grabbing the gun,*

*sliding it to the other room,*

*screaming for help.*

*All in seconds,*

*desperately racing to beat the clock*

*of my Father’s mortal life.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades*

*Blood leaked across the floor*

*oozing into the carpet, through my jacket*

*on my shirt, my jeans, and hands.* 

*Cradling my Father, I whispered to him,*

*“I’m here. It’s gonna be okay. I’m here.”*

*A ghost looked back at me.* 

*The world was a different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My phone buzzed- a text from the stranger who let me in.*

*“Can you leave?”*

*“No- he shot himself.”*

*The phone rang. I answered.* 

*“You have to come outside. The police won’t come in till you come out.”*

*My mission incomplete.*

*My breath quickened, I looked to my Father again,*

*trying to hear his final words.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades.*

*I could not leave him,*

*And yet- my legs carried me to my feet*

*and out the door to a different place.*

*I walked down stairs.*

*I entered the garage.*

*Police lights everywhere.*

*A voice screamed, “He has blood on his hands!”*

*My arms raised, guns drawn on me.*

*I heard my own voice screaming.*

*“Help him please, he shot himself, dear God help him!”*

*I felt myself walk through the garage doors.*

*Patted down, handcuffed, pushed against a wall.*

*The handcuffs grated sharply against my skin*

*But no one there to feel them.*

*I could not breathe; the spirit had left me*

*an empty husk alone in the desolate place*

*where God could not be.* 

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Police asked where his office was.*

*I could not say, could not remember.*

*My heart fell.*

*I could not remember. I could not remember.*

*Why could I not remember?*

*Why could I not remember*

*when it was my Father dying?*

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Sitting on a curb, the wind howling, the skies grey.*

*The blood, dried and caked on my hands.*

*Staring wordlessly at it.*

*A deafening silence*

*interrupted by police officers speaking to me.*

*I heard and I responded*

*but I did not comprehend.*

*Jacket-less, I shivered as the rain began pouring.*

*The memory fades.* 

*I came back to myself.*

*The blood cried out the horror,*

*the anguish, the heartbreak, the injustice.*

*It cried these things to me and many more.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I begged the police to let me clean it off.*

*I heard an apology, but the blood remained.* 

*Rain will wash the blood away instead.* 

*Images and sounds and faces came and went.*

*But no one witnessed them.*

*Pictures, fingerprints, DNA, taken.*

*Questions and questions and questions* 

*with no one there to answer them.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My mom, my brother, my step-father waiting.*

*Mom sobbing as we embraced.* 

*The bullet pierced my heart again*

*My father was not the only one shot that day.*

*In the car, headed to the trauma center.*

*The car stopped, and the dam broke.*

*Blood, tears, and terror erupted from within.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I understand now, truth at a bitter price,*

*that fear is a sacred thing*

*and always has been and always will be.*

*The world was a Different place there.*",mackdad42,2019-03-27 18:27:28,2,816,74.14,22.74,91.31,1.76,48,14.95,91.91,55.02,16.79,14.22,9.93,0.12,0.49,3.31,0.37,2.57,11.52,10.91,6.74,3.92,4.29,2.57,15.2,3.43,2.21,0.86,0.74,0.74,4.9,0.98,3.92,0.49,0.74,1.47,8.82,1.47,0.12,0.37,4.41,10.66,2.94,0.37,1.72,0.74,0.98,4.29,5.64,1.35,2.45,1.47,3.92,3.19,0.61,0.12,0.12,4.53,0.98,0.61,2.94,0.12,0.37,6.99,3.92,0.49,17.03,3.06,9.8,4.41,1.72,0.37,0.74,0.25,0.74,0.49,0.37,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,0,48.04,10.66,6.13,0,0.37,0.37,0.25,0.61,1.47,0.74,0,27.45

b6dfxz,How can I accept my diagnosis?,"TRIGGER WARNING! I’m terribly sorry if my question makes no sense. I was recently diagnosed with ptsd. I just find it very hard to accept it. With the traumas I have endured I would just tell myself it didn’t happen or that I’m overreacting  and that people have had worse. Since this seems like a safe place I’ll say what are my traumas. When I was a little boy my babysitter’s daughter groomed me to preform stuff on her. (sorry i would just feel really nasty going into more detail about this) The other thing is I’ve seen people die when I was younger. They were executed for belonging to a rival drug group. (I find it really weird that I feel more comfortable talking about witnessing the violence than I do the other thing) My head also tends to spin. (which am doing right now rambling on) Back to my main point is that I feel like I can’t have ptsd. I’m not a soldier,never killed, I just feel fake for being diagnosed with it. I’m an 18 year old boy and from the suburbs. The only reason I saw the violence was because I would spend my summers in our parents former home in their home country and  just saw some fucked shit go down (Wrong place wrong time) 18 years old and being diagnosed with ptsd. I just can’t. People see and experience things way worse than what I’ve gone through everyday.

b6f100,I don't wake up from nightmares,"I feel like people always talk about nightmares waking them up, but I have the opposite problem. When I'm having a nightmare, I feel like I can't wake up. I almost always feel trapped in the nightmare (usually I'm back in the abusive relationship and literally think to myself that I'm trapped again). I struggle to wake up. It seems like until I get through the worst of the nightmare and to a relatively neutral point, I cannot wake up. Sometimes I'll start to wake up or someone will try to wake me up, but I'll immediately go back to sleep and right back to the nightmare.

I wish I would wake up - I'd rather wake up panicking and just deal with it than be trapped in my own brain.

b6fw4y,Primal Aggression from PTSD Help (TW),"I am at a loss where to go to get some advice. I've tried searching every term I could think of and am now just staring at this blank page trying to formulate what to write. 

I am a 23 year old who suffers from ptsd that shows itself in DID, Anxiety, Depression. Lately I have been having a very hard time with life. Struggles are pushing out all the dark parts of me I never wanted anyone to see. I was abused bad as a child. Raped almost every day for about 6-7 years by my half brother. A few other times I had been raped by family friends and or my drunken moms boyfriends. I have vague memories of ritualistic abuse from a baby sitter well before my brother started raping me, i'd say around 2-5? My mother abused me, hit, yelled, restrained, locked me up and generally just had a lack of care for me. Dispite this I still loved my mother and did everything in my power to please her and every abuser I've ever had. My problem lately is during that time growing up I wouldn't say I was a person, human really. We owned a pack of hybrid wolves, anywhere from 6-18 depending on if we had a litter or not. I grew up with these animals... they were my true family. 

Any time I was beat or raped I'd escape outside, go hide in their dens, play with them, just generally seek comfort in the living things that werent out to harm me despite my want to please. My wolves accepted me... I was one of the pack. I never talked much, to anyone, just thought to those wolves and I feel they truly heard me and talked back to me. Id roll in the mud for hours on end with them, play tug or war, even share in their treats and meals. Sometimes my mom would be drunk and mad and even bathe me outside with the dogs if I was too dirty to come inside. I really was raised as a dog. Only came inside to sleep for fear of being in a situation from my brother or mother. 
Jump to now... I'm 23 and fucked up. My mom passed away when I was 13 and we had moved away from my brother a year earlier because my mom finally realized and believed me on the abuse he was causing me. I escaped both my main abusers within a year and it honestly felt pretty good. My uncle took me in and I was starting to open up more, have friends, even got a GF whos been with me for going on 1w years now..i  just wanted be a normal person... but then life smacked me in my big fat face. I became an adult and was thrown into the world on my own. Got a job, a place and things started going downhill. Car accident, loosing said job TWICE, mother in law trying to commit suicide and loosing her husband and house, brother in law loosing his wife and helping him raise his two twin girls... it all just became too much. My need to please outweighed my need for nuture after all I'd been through. And now I'm here.. today dreading my next anxiety attack. They come and go almost every day now.. my problem is these anxiety attacks are BAD.... the worst I've had, ever. I become that child.. that feral child who just bites, scratches, tries to get away from everything and everyone. I feel like my human conciousness is sitting there, watching as my body thrashes about, unable to cope with the feelings its having. During these episodes even my parts are forced to just wath what I would call ""core/body/animal"" ruin my life further. They hurt my partner even when she is just trying to help calm me. She has no idea how to contain the animal i become and neither do i. Ive tried grounding techniques, music, heat, weight, hugs, kisses, talking, food, nothing seems to calm the beast that comes forward. 

I feel terrible because the most reccent anxiety attack I had I flipped shit on my partner. She tried to contain me thrashing my head into the wall and I snapped and bit her, like bit down and shook my head ready to rip the flesh off her bones bit her. It was the first time id ever done something so feral, so primal.. so... gone. I sat there screaming at myself to stop but I couldn't. All i could manage was to cry through the angry growls coming from my mouth. My gf trys to cuddle me, but often times I cant be touch, approached even looked at, it feels like a threat to me, a stare down. 

I love animals... I live dogs.. I have 3 big dogs now... I love being their pack leader... I know I'll always be primal by nature... but I'm so scared I am going to snap fully one of these days. I'm scared the 3 hours if takes me to calm down out of my episode is going to turn into I never calm down from my episode and I am stuck in that pack animalistic mindset the rest of my life. Im good at communicating... at talking.. at helping others.. but I can never help myself. I can never communicate my feelings truthfully and feel eventually that dog inside me, that crazy wolf is going to decided this whole world is evil and I need to be able to protect myself from it at all times.... i contemplate suicide a lot lately, I dont want to snap and end up harming someone I care deeply about. The world hurts me so much every day that honestly my last thought before bed is ""please, dont wake up."" I can't keep doing this.. my box I worked so hard to tie up is coming undone... i need help.. i feel like im falling back into a dark world I wanted to forget.

b6h3i3,Constant state of flashbacks and too tired to go on (trigger warning),"I had a appointment with a new psychiatrist on Monday so I prepared some reports from my 13 years of bi weekly visits to my psychologist on Sunday last week. I've had the C-PTSD, MDD diagnosis for 13 years now I read some of it and it triggered me. Especially my suicide attempt and what lead to it 13 years ago. Where the military played games and my father egged me when I was on leave from the army to swallow a bottle of amitriptyline because he was calling me a ""pussy"" and yelling ""do it, do it"" at the time.   This has triggered all my flashbacks and they are keeping me awake as I type this as I haven't slept tonight (it's 6 am).

I think I am losing hope, my trauma stems all the way back to when I was an infant and my father would get angry at my crying and shake me and hit me in the crib. Although I cannot remember this I talked to one of his friends at that time about 5 years ago and they where telling me the story about how they had to stop my father from doing it.

Long story short, I grew up with a  distant mother, who forgot about me, cheated on my father. My father was a very angry man, beat me every single day and was an insane narcissist. My mother divorced when I was 11, not surprised as my father beat her everyday. She didn't take me with her and forgot about me, only to leave me alone with the devil.

Then when I was 19 I joined the Army because I thought I was weak, just like my father told me on a daily basis all my life. He called me a moron and idiot on a daily basis, beat me for everything I did and everything I ever did was completely wrong.

The army caused me my second stage of my trauma as I got pretty severely injured there but got no help and was abused and threatened constantly and my injuries where brushed off until I was discharged medically.

  

  Now I live with constant daily flashbacks for the past 13 years, constant depression, self hate but also hate for people around me. People can trigger me in a split second, if they look at me wrong or say something I don't understand.

But this week my PTSD has went atomic, I feel like I'm in a constant state of flashbacks and emotional flashbacks.  

I keep getting cramps all over my body, feel like garbage and I really don't think I can take this anymore.  

I have zero friends for 13 years, zero family for 2 years now, have a supportive gf somehow (my first real gf ever) but she's at her wits end as she just doesn't know how to help me. She's been amazing the last couple days, helping me out with everything, cooking but I feel embarrassed.  

Tonight before sleep I had about 5 flashbacks in a row and I went on an angry tirade taking about my trauma, predicting my things in my life that are coming up (I have a lot of medical treatments for my pain) and she went to bed at 4 am.  

She's missed the last 3 days of school, has listened to everything I said but I don't know. I feel like this is damaging us but I can't stop it. I'm on autopilot and it feels almost impossible to stop this force that's clouding me.   

It's too hard, the psychiatrist is the second professional counselor type to be surprised I haven't killed myself. My old psychologist (not the 13 yr one) literally asked me ""How did you not kill yourself yet"" and the truth is that I'm scared of what happens after you die. That's my only obstacle but I'm so close to just ending my misery and ruining my gf's life.

b6mmue,My dad’s flash backs and confusion over what is real or not after coma (trigger warning regarding coma flashbacks),"Hi all, this is my first time posting to this group so I hope I don’t break any rules with this and that it is ok to post this here. I’am very concerned with how my Dad is feeling at the moment and how to discuss it in a way that doesn’t make him feel like he can’t talk but also won’t trigger him. About 3 years ago he got chronic pneumonia which advanced into sepsis, within a week he was in an induced coma (he was an incredibly fit person prior to this and very independent) 

He was in the coma for a few week and experience very vivid dreams which weren’t very nice for him and were very very real for him. We all worked together and 3 years on he is making amazing progress, though he will never physically be the same (He now has Addison’s) I’m so proud of him. 

He has had occasional moments where new flash backs with occur or he will forget who he is but in general we have talked, curled up the watch a movie and take a time out (this is what he likes to do) but yesterday he had another flash back and has been sobbing all day, I don’t know what I can do to help. I love this man so much, he is my best friend and I wish I could do more, I don’t want to push boundaries, I also know he isn’t ready for therapy as it would open it all back up and stress can make him very very ill.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Be it the person or a family member, do you have any suggestions? I’m concerned the stress will put him back into adrenal crisis.

Thank you for taking the time to read and apologies if this isn’t the place to post, I’m honestly not sure where else I could discuss this and would appreciate any suggestions.",lisdelam,2019-03-28 11:47:14,7,347,11.52,62.44,23.75,74.12,31.55,11.82,94.52,61.38,19.88,12.68,5.19,0.58,0.58,6.34,0,7.2,4.61,10.37,13.83,7.2,8.36,3.46,19.88,3.17,2.02,2.88,0.86,3.46,5.48,3.75,1.15,0.58,0,0.29,14.99,0.86,1.44,0,7.2,14.12,1.73,2.59,2.31,3.46,1.73,4.32,1.73,0.58,0,0.58,2.59,0,2.31,0,0,7.49,2.88,1.73,2.02,1.44,0.58,4.03,13.83,1.73,14.12,0.86,6.63,6.63,0.58,0.86,0.29,0,0,0,0.29,0,0,0.29,0,0,12.39,2.31,2.88,0,0,0.58,0,0,0,4.32,2.31,0
b6nuqq,I don’t know what to do anymore,"I am in my thirties and was recently diagnosed with ptsd, ocd and depression. None of these were surprising to me, but it is the first time I have been diagnosed with ptsd and ocd. Previously, I was diagnosed with just about everything: adhd, schizophrenia, anxiety... I have known for some time that I have ptsd.

I was sexually and psychologically abused as a child and as an adult. I have never “gotten anywhere” in life despite being considered exceptionally intelligent, being placed in the gifted program at school, and earning an academic scholarship to a well-regarded private college.

I don’t have any problems with addiction, other than a smoking habit which I have been able to kick. I recently relapsed but smoke only four or five cigarettes a day. I take medication and I am in psychoanalysis via an association, which costs me nearly nothing. I can’t afford emdr.

I recently broke up with a controlling man who liked to break promises and who told me multiple times that if he were me he would kill himself. I am no longer a legal resident of the country where I live and I earn very little money giving lessons. I do have health insurance which allows me to pay for doctors visits and medication at a low cost. If I were to return to the USA I would not have insurance, a car or a place to live, except perhaps with the people who abused me in childhood.

I have no idea how to go on living like this or why. I am a shadow of who I used to be and now, in my mid thirties I fear I am too old to get better or “course correct” my life.

I feel like a prisoner. I had a job in this country previously and had to stop because of my residency problems. After that I worked illegally as a nanny and my employers withheld money they owed me, threatened to denounce me to immigration and allowed their children to yell at me and hit me. I will not go back to that, but there are very few other jobs, if any, available to people in my situation.

I am exhausted and I don’t know who I am anymore. More and more I don’t care what happens to me.

I want an interesting and prosperous life and a peaceful mind. I don’t think that is really possible for me anymore, if it ever was.

b6pfyt,Advice on how to help my (31F) partner (37M) who deals with ptsd.,"Hey all. 

I recently started dating this man. He is absolutely incredible. He’s gentle and sweet, he’s so smart and he makes me laugh. He suffers from ptsd pretty badly however. I have no experience with this at all. I want to make our relationship work and last but I’m at a loss on how to be supportive of him. He’s made it known he has it, he doesn’t sleep, he rarely goes to work at this point and he stays home with his dogs almost all day. I love being around him and doing anything he wants to do at all. I have never pressured him to talk to me about any of it and I won’t do that. I want him to know I’m here for him though. He’s not an angry man, just a very sad man. He works in the police force and spent some time in the military also.

So basically, I’m looking for any advice on how to nurture this relationship properly and make sure he’s comfortable with me. Also, anything I should be aware of.

I would play with friends and enjoy hobbies as if tomorrow would never come. Now it's as if I'm always living in tomorrow, never the present. 

I lost my mother at 14 years old to a fatal asthma attack. From there I started pushing everyone away because I just couldn't be happy and carefree like everyone else was. Their problems seemed so small and I couldn't stand what normal people considered a ""bad day"". It began to sicken me, and I became envious and angry at everyone.

I discovered marijuana shortly after my mom passed and it was a godsend. I could escape to a place where I felt content with everything and everyone.

When I was 19 I met the woman of my dreams and we moved in together.

I continued to experiment with drugs and eventually it led to me trying methamphetamine. I was actually sold meth instead of cocaine by someone I thought I could trust at the time. Ending up doing too much and almost lost my life. Nothing has been the same since then.

I was able to quit meth but the near death experience changed me forever. My body was completely numb that night and I was barely able to dial 911. This was my first panic attack of many and became the PTSD event I'll never forget. Talking to the responder as the ambulance arrived calmed me down enough that I decided to turn away the ambulance when they arrived, but this night is as fresh in my memory as if it just happened yesterday.

Ever since then I get panic attacks from any unfamiliar body sensation. Like, heart palpitating, limb-numbing, im-about-to-die panic attacks. Some days are okay, some no so okay, and some just miserable. Something as natural as bad gas will send me into a panic because I think my heart is about to stop, the cyclical thinking takes over and I'm done for. 

I found alcohol at a young age and became a severe drinker for about 5 years (21-26). Alcohol made everything okay. I started drinking all day every day. The girl I mentioned earlier was a heavy drinker as well. We got married.

Last year she was driving drunk and got into a fatal accident. We had been togther for 7 years. I've also lost a sister to heroin and my closest friend to a heart attack. All of these instant deaths just reaffirm my belief that I'm going to die instantly at some point, so I'm constantly anxious and plagued with apprehension about when this will happen.

I gave up drinking last year after my wife passed. It has been hard but I'm doing a little better with the alcohol dependancy out of the picture. I'm currently clean and sober but have been taking kratom occasionally.

I go to therapy and I like it, it helps, but it's no cure for my problem.

I barely eat or sleep these days. I can hardly breathe. 

I have no friends. I had to move back home with my dad and stepmom but I don't get along with either of them too well. I'm just a weirdo and no one understands me.

I feel like I'm going to die any moment and it's tormenting me. I'm always on the verge of the next panic attack.

I don't know what to do. I want it to be over but I also fear death. I feel so hopeless.",rhorains,2019-03-29 01:21:15,10,611,33.69,15.9,97.75,1.45,12.73,16.2,94.11,57.12,17.84,12.77,11.62,0.49,0,0.16,0.49,5.07,4.75,14.08,9.82,6.87,9,2.13,20.13,4.91,2.95,1.31,1.47,2.13,7.69,2.29,5.4,1.47,1.64,0.82,5.73,0.98,0.49,1.15,0.16,14.4,3.27,1.47,1.96,3.44,3.11,2.45,1.31,0.16,0,0.98,3.93,1.31,1.64,0,1.47,8.18,1.96,1.47,2.45,1.15,1.31,8.18,9.33,1.64,17.84,3.11,5.24,9.66,0,1.96,0.16,0.16,0.16,1.47,0.82,0,0,0.49,0.33,0,14.4,7.69,2.13,0,0,0,0,0.82,0.33,3.11,0.33,0

b713es,Bizzare Aversion to Healing?,"Its a bit strange and a little masochistic to think about, but a small part of me doesn’t want to be healing, even though I’m doing a pretty good job of moving forward. My father was physically, verbally and emotionally abusive from the time that I was 9 years old until I was 14. (The cops were called several times, but they never removed him from the house because my father was very clever to hide his abuse, as well as my mother having Alzheimers and being unable to recall episodes she was present for, not to mention she’s stuck in denial) Now, at age 16, I see my twin brother being verbally and emotionally abused. Even my mother has been becoming more manipulative. Its IMMENSELY triggering, especially considering that nobody in my family realizes what’s actually happening is abuse. Ive completely stopped speaking with my father and distanced myself from my mother as much as possible. Its really helping me heal, but a small part of me wants to remain upset about this. Whenever I don’t reflect blood-curdling hatred towards my father when thinking about his actions, my mind says, “What? You’re not upset? Well, I guess your father was right, you are just being a spoiled brat who just THINKS her life is miserable.” Im not sure what it is, but there’s this notion in my head that says if I stay upset, then maybe someone will help me out of this shithole.

b71c3u,Is it safe to try and unravel blocked out memories alone?,"I know I have some moments during my previous abusive relationship that I don’t remember and have blocked out I am assuming on purpose but I feel like I need to remember them in order to understand what is happening/happened to me but I am too scared and/or embarrassed to do it with anyone else. I ignored it for years telling myself it didn’t happen, you let it happen, your over exaggerating etc. But recently I had a full blown flashback in the middle of trying to be intimate with my fiancé and I’ve never been so scared in my life and I’m sure he was scared too. I’m not sure what triggered it as we weren’t doing anything we haven’t done a ton of times, we’ve been together for 4 years. 

Since that day I’ve had this looming sense of doom, if that make sense. Like any moment now my world is going to collapse and I am going to be right back where I was all those years ago, alone and scared and ready to kill my self just to escape. 

So my question is, is it safe to try and uncover this alone? I don’t know what it is, I don’t know what will happen but I just got, I think at least, my ptsd under control (not many nightmares, no more full blown night terrors, no constant fear) and I’m scared if I do this without proper help I will screw something up and be back at square one again.

b72dk5,I write because it helps me deal,"May be TL:DR, but I write when I feel myself slipping. Before I turned 18, I always had an immense respect for the military. I was raised by my parents to always thank men and women in uniform for their service. When I turned 19, I decided to join. I went through OSUT at Fort Knox and ended up doing 9 years in the Army National Guard before switching to the Air National Guard last year where I remain. PTSD is huge in the military, but I always brushed it off as being “weak minded” as most of us do. 

After I finished college, I returned home and didn’t quite know what my path in life would be. After multiple jobs like Dicks Sporting Goods and security work, my brother who is a paramedic firefighter convinced me to try the fire service. I started volunteering and fell in love with it. The next two years were spent gaining all of my certifications needed to become a full time firefighter and I got my EMT certification as well. Then the time finally came where I was hired full time after volunteering for almost 3 years. 

It was my first day on shift and I was assigned to the station ambulance. A very hot North Carolina day in July and my shift started at 7 am. Around 10 am, I was dispatched to my first call; motor vehicle accident vs pedestrian. I flipped on the lights and sirens of my ambulance and headed toward the call. Then the dispatcher keys up the radio and says, “all units responding to MVA, be advised the patient is a pediatric”

I arrived on scene to find a Highway Patrol trooper already on scene. He was up a driveway and all I could see was his waist up. He was bent over, bobbing up and down. My hands sweating and shaking, I picked up my radio and said, “All units responding. We have CPR in progress. I repeat working CPR in progress”

I slammed the truck in park and jumped out, grabbing my trauma and airway bag, still unable to see what was going on. I created the top of the driveway to find a 4 foot wide pool of blood and a small child lying in the middle of it, the state trooper kneeling without a car doing compressions. His cap lay upside down in the blood. 

Skipping many graphic details, Fast forward to us en route to the hospital. I hold the railing of the truck with one hand and continue compressions on the child, my hand slipping on her chest from blood and brain matter. We get her into the ER and she’s pronounced dead less than a minute later. It was the day before her second birthday. 

That was my experience with death. And unfortunately much more was to come in the next year and a half while I was at that fire station. At first it didn’t bother me as much as I thought it would. 

And then it hit me like a ton of bricks one day. I was driving to the grocery store and I just started crying uncontrollably to the point I couldn’t see and had to pull over. All of the memories of her just came flooding back. Not just her, but the dozens of people I’ve tried to save but couldn’t and had them die right in front of me. It passed after a few minutes and all was fine. Until it became a recurring nightmare and though for me. It has effected me to the point I have withdrawn from people and it has brought my marriage on the brink of collapse. My wife doesn’t know how to handle it and I can’t explain it to her because she just wouldn’t understand. 

I don’t write this as a pity party. I’ve sought help from different sources, but don’t let anyone ever tell you PTSD is for the weak. It is very very real. And I went from laughing about it, to realizing my career will never be easy and I’ve experienced things that will haunt me for the rest of my life. Talk to people you think can get you. Write stories to take your mind off. The biggest thing I’ve learned is to express my feelings and not bottle them up which is exactly why I’m typing this today.

b7483y,I was officially diagnosed with ptsd but I feel like I don't deserve it?,"About a month ago I was finally officially diagnosed with PTSD. I was already diagnosed with atypical depression, borderline personality disorder, autism (not yet specified as to what degree or where on the spectrum I am) and anxiety disorder. My psychiatrist told me that a lot of mental illnesses kind of overlap as they often have similar symptoms so it's difficult to tell what my original problem was or what problem should be addressed first. I finally have the official diagnoses though so I'm kind of relieved that it's not just in my head. I'm still not sure what to do with it exactly. I've been trying different kind of meds for a very long time but nothing has helped me feel any better yet. I've gotten worse as the years went by and I'm still sitting here in this hole unable to climb out. 

I never really expected to have PTSD as I don't have all of the typical symptoms. I do have flashbacks of past trauma but I can repress them almost perfectly, or at least I think I can. I a able to tell reality from memories though, which I'm told most PTSD sufferers can't. I can't say if this assumption is correct because I know practically nothing about PTSD. I also don't think that what I went through is bad enough for me to develop PTSD. I'm not a war soldier. I haven't seen people die violently. I never had to kill enemies. So I don't get why I would develop PTSD when so many other people have been through way worse shit than I have. I feel like I haven't 'earned' the right to get PTSD. If that makes any sense.

Are there any books or informational websites I can consult to better understand this disorder? I'd like to read about other people's experiences and how they cope with it. I'd also appreciate any personal tips you might have. Anything that might help me feel better is welcome because I haven't been well for far too long.

b74rbs,"I’m broken, but fixable.","I’ve been struggling with what I now know is PTSD for 7 years. Until today, I was of the mindset that life was supposed to feel this way. That everyone on earth felt this way and just kept it to themselves. That my daily, world shattering anxieties and emotions were normal... 

They’re not. 

I can’t describe the rush of emotions I’m feeling right now. I feel hope for the first time in years. I’d forgotten that feeling entirely. Hope that I can feel something other than constant fear and dark thoughts. I feel validated in my struggles that I suppressed for so long. Struggles that I wouldn’t even acknowledge, until today. Struggles that I made myself accept and move on from. 

But I also feel sad for my past self. Sad that I let myself accept such misery for years. Sad for the joy I could’ve had but didn’t. The time I could’ve spent happy but wasn’t. The opportunities I could’ve seized but didn’t. Sad for the perpetual turmoil and isolation I forced myself into. Sad for the girl that wanted to flourish all these years but was buried too deeply under darkness and misery. But there’s nowhere to look but up, from this point forward. 

Now I can finally start the journey of healing. 

My therapist wants me to write out the experience that triggered my ptsd in a story. I’m nervous to dig into that part of myself again, but knowing there’s a light at the end of the tunnel is something I never thought I’d get to know... 
I have no idea what to expect as I start the process of dealing with my traumas and it scares the shit out of me, but it beats living as I have the last 7 years. 

I’m broken but fixable.

I wish I could put into words what I feel more eloquently, but just being able to share this discovery with you anonymous strangers has made me feel more peace and happiness than I’ve felt in years. 

Cheers to new beginnings I hope.",frankyfriday,2019-03-29 17:15:19,3,348,35.5,3.1,99,8.57,12.43,16.09,94.83,58.62,21.26,13.51,12.93,0,0.29,0,0.29,7.76,4.89,14.37,9.77,4.31,7.47,2.59,20.69,5.17,1.72,0.86,0.86,1.44,9.48,3.74,5.17,2.87,0.29,2.3,2.59,0,0,0.29,0,18.68,6.03,1.15,3.45,1.72,1.44,5.75,4.6,1.15,0,3.16,1.44,0.29,1.15,0,0,4.31,0.29,0.86,2.59,0.86,0.29,6.32,12.64,1.72,16.38,1.44,6.9,8.62,0.29,0,0,0.29,0,0.29,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0,16.95,9.2,2.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.46,0,0

b76oxo,Not Enough?,"I’ve struggled with PTSD for two years now because of a multitude of traumas that happened in the spring of 2017, but mainly the attempted suicide of my closest friend. I know that trauma is subjective, and that anyone can be traumatized, but many times I feel that because she didn’t “die,” I’m not worthy of being traumatized. I that my trauma isn’t valid, or that I’m weak. When I open up to people, I often tell them that my friend did commit suicide, not only because it feels that way to me, but so that I’ll be taken seriously. Truthfully, she hanged herself in an attempted suicide and I was blamed for it and told that anything that happened to her was my fault. She was in a coma for a month and woke up with amnesia and severe brain damage. Although she survived, I haven’t seen her since, she doesn’t remember me, and I carry the weight of the incident on my shoulders every day. It’s like she might as well be dead. I don’t want to take away from the experiences of people who have legitimately lost someone to suicide, but I often mourn in the same way. I feel like I’m not worthy of feeling this pain, or that I’m pathetic or weak. I just don’t know how to face it. I feel like my trauma isn’t enough to be taken seriously.

b76ytz,my reactions are driving people away,"i have ptsd, i don't know what from. that sounds weird i know. i was told it was from watching my mother and grandfather die, but my reactions and the things that set me off dont seem to reflect that (except for panic attacks at mentions of moms dying in detail.) i flinch or duck/cover my head whenever someone calls my name, throws something or even rolls something near me (it doesn't even have to be anywhere near me for me to flinch tbh) and i have panic attacks when people yell.

when my mom was alive she would try to hug me or touch me in a completely casual or motherly way. it was not threatening or even aggressive, but i would squirm away without intending to. another time she was coming towards me in a very normal way when we were having an argument and i screamed ""don't you dare fucking touch me. do not fucking touch me, ever."" i feel so bad because this probably really hurt her. i don't know why i do it.

today a fire drill happened and when the alarm went off i jumped and put my hands up to my head. the people around me asked if i was ok, but later i heard one of them saying ""it was just a fire drill, we have them every month. this person almost had a panic attack, it was so weird.""

another time my friend went to playfully hit me and i jerked away and said ""dont do that. do not EVER do that."" the words seemed to not come from my own mouth.

these are a few among many instances of this happening. i am tired of having these reactions. it's really putting people off and hurting people's feelings. they either assume i am scared of them or ask me if i need to talk to someone. is there any way i can stop this?",memoryserum,2019-03-29 21:15:26,1,330,10.54,14.44,96.79,1,15,11.82,96.06,63.33,23.33,15.45,12.42,0.61,0.3,0.91,1.21,7.88,3.33,11.52,11.21,6.97,8.48,3.33,19.09,3.64,0.61,2.12,0.3,2.12,7.58,0.91,6.36,1.82,3.03,0.61,10.91,1.52,0.3,2.12,0.3,15.45,2.73,1.82,1.52,6.06,1.21,6.06,5.15,0.3,1.82,3.03,2.42,1.21,0.61,0.61,0,4.24,1.21,0.3,1.52,0.3,1.21,5.76,11.21,0.3,13.33,2.73,6.06,4.55,0,0.61,0,0,0,0.91,1.21,0.61,0.3,0.3,0,0,13.94,6.06,2.42,0,0,0.3,0,0,1.82,1.82,1.21,0.3

b7bebs,Does this sound like PTSD to you?,"TW: CAR ACCIDENTS 

Hi - I apologize for being so ignorant about this topic it's just that I haven't been able to reach my therapist since my accident and I have a lot of questions.

Basically a while ago I was crossing the street and then a month or so later I woke up in the hospital with a broken pelvis among other things( to be honest I have literally zero memory of crossing the street it's just what I've been told I was doing.) I suffered a TBI so I have no memory of the actual event itself happening which is lucky for me considering what seeing it did to my boyfriend, but I haven't been able to go back to school ever since then and I had to go through a lot of therapy to get to the point where I could even walk without a walker and remember things. I got hit within the second week of my sophomore year of college and I missed the whole thing so I'm going back for summer classes.

Even though I didn't really experience it; since then I've been worried about crossing the street, worried about getting hit by a car, worried about driving a car, worried about going back to school and I get hit by a car and I die this time, even worried about getting in my boyfriend's car later or my friend's cars... and then there is the even more acute fear of death and fear of going back to Pittsburgh. It's just not particularly severe and though I know that my boyfriend is probably suffering with PTSD, I feel it hard to justify the concept I might be suffering with PTSD myself. 

Does this sound like PTSD to any of you???

I’ve been through very traumatic times because of them, leading to quite intense stress and very intense fear for a few years now...

anyways, i don’t trust them or anyone associated with them.

i’m not rehashing all this or going into detail, but point blank;

is there any way anybody who lives in the complex (neighbors), or even building management that could go into my apt? even further, lace my food or drink with drugs etc?

Sounds ridiculous, I’m fully aware of that... just curious.

My parents have told me that it’s illegal and they would need permission before doing so.

(thing is, I’ve had many yelling arguments in that apartment, loud enough for the whole floor to hear easily...  and the local fire dept actually had a set of keys in an emergency)

People like to laugh, be condescending, be rude, pass judgment and have absolutely no idea nor care how they come across sometimes. Your feelings are still valid.

That’s okay, your feelings are still valid.

I hope you all remeber that no matter the topic, if it hurts you, you are allowed to voice your opinion and it is okay that that “ridiculous overreaction” is a part of your day.

I hope you all stay strong and never stop standing up for yourself and what you feel is valid in your life. At the end of the day, those are your values and this is how you choose to live your life. I’m just grateful I’m the strong one and not the one on the giving end. I’m happy with how I stand up for myself.

b7g2ni,Does PTSD breed personality disorders?,"Who else here has both PTSD and a personality disorder?

I had a traumatic childhood, where I was always ""on alert"" for the presence of my abusive father. The man would get insanely angry - I'm talking a level of anger that seems like it shouldn't be possible. He would have emotional blow-ups over the smallest things.

So little me decided at some point that emotions are for assholes and idiots (like my father), so fuck emotions. Emotions are scary.

This also eroded at my sense of self worth, so over time, little me was conditioned to be afraid of emotions, to be afraid of people (especially in close proximity).

And so I became avoidant of all sorts of things. School activities. Girlfriends. School activities. Sharing emotions with others. Feeling safe around others. Checking e-mail. Etc.

All of this added up to me developing Avoidant Personality Disorder. It also led to me developing PTSD.

And the more, I've thought about it, the more I've wondered: ""Do most personality disorders caused by childhood trauma? Do many people with personality disorders have PTSD, and vice versa?""

b7gguc,Touching weirdness,"(cross-posted from r/OCD)

So touching is a big part of my OCD/PTSD/own special brand of weirdness. I cannot stand and get really uncomfortable when people touch me in most capacities. However, I grew up with the habit of touching others (on the shoulder, arm, face, etc.) as a way to get my point across because I have trouble talking, especially when discussing emotional things.

I understand that it's not okay to touch people without permission and I understand that it can greatly upset some people, because it greatly upsets me. The hypocrisy in my own brain is weird. I feel badly about it because obviously if it upsets me to be touched, I should give other people the same respect and not touch them. But it's really hard to get out of the habit of touching other people.

b7ikok,Timeline of my abusive marriage (trigger warning: sexual assault) part 1 - 2006-2009,"Timeline of my marriage. I need to get this all out. 

I met my ex husband in college, we were both non-traditional students. I was 25, he was 27, and we met on an archaeological dig over the summer of 2005. I had no feelings about him then, the only thing I remember about him from the dig was that he loudly complained to another male classmate about having to take orders from women (I asked him about this 9 months later, right when we started dating, and he brushed it off as a joke. I believed him because he was heavily involved in the gender studies department at the time...). So that was the first red flag that I ignored. 

March of 2006, after him pursuing me for about a month, I finally broke down and hung out with him. There were so many red flags. Our first date he didn’t have any money, despite the fact that he worked and we both had student loans which paid out living expense money. He was waiting for money from his dad to come in the mail. I was too dumb to care, and thought that his “worry” over not being able to take me out was endearing. 

Within 4 weeks of dating he started talking marriage! He would say things like “I’ve always said that I’d never get married, but that was before I met you.” It was so flattering at the time. I was swept off my feet. I was about to graduate and was uncertain about what to do with my life next. Around this time he started pressuring me to have anal sex with him, which is something I’d never done and wasn’t particularly interested in. I went along with it and I think it traumatized me. I remember going to campus afterwards and sitting in the bathroom shaking. I already had CPTSD and I think this solidified a trauma bond between us. 

We got married in May 2006 after dating for 3 months. It was like I was on autopilot. After we were married all these little details slipped out that he hadn’t mentioned: he had been diagnosed bipolar and was supposed to be on meds, he had been in AA when he started college at 26 but had dropped out right before pursuing me, he had had sexual relations with men in the past, he had been to rehab as a teenager for cocaine use. I was an innocent person and wasn’t ready for any of this, but I tried to take it in stride and make the best of my marriage. I stupidly thought we were in love and love would conquer all.

Then a debt collector showed up to our apartment to serve him papers. He was past due $6000 on a credit card and had no way to pay it. I think he married me because he thought I had more family money than I did, and that I/my family would step in and pay it off for him. Nowadays I like to imagine how bummed he must have been when that wasn’t the case. 

He applied to the same graduate programs that I was interested in and we both were accepted to the same school in a new city. For some reason the move was incredibly harrowing, like his approach to moving house was acting like we had to do it as quickly as possible without any help. Looking back, he behaved during the move the way he did while on Adderall or cocaine, but I was too naive back then to have any idea. 

The first time he gave me the silent treatment, I was shocked and scared. I had interrupted him while he was telling his brother and brother’s gf a story in a bar to interject something, and suddenly he went silent and wouldn’t make eye contact with me. This continued all the way back to where we were spending the night. He just kept drinking once we were alone, and ignoring me and I had to get on my knees and literally beg him to forgive me. He accepted my apology and then like... forced me to go down on him and then grabbed my hair pulled it hard and raped (?) me to show me who was boss. 

After 6 months of marriage he started drinking every single night. When I confronted him about it he had a complete meltdown and accused me of regretting marrying him. Once he left me standing in the middle of a parking lot in a bad neighborhood so that he could go in and get some beer (I don’t remember why he said I couldn’t come inside with him, but now I think he was probably buying drugs too). Then he got super trashed on Thanksgiving and when I became upset/distraught he threatened to harm himself with a razor (but didn’t, he never did... but funny enough I started to harm myself after a while!). Then about a few weeks later, out of nowhere while I was studying, he angrily confronted me and accused me of “ruining his Thanksgiving” with my bitchiness. I was blindsided and basically told him a list of all the bullshit he put me through over the 6 months of our marriage. He got all sad/shocked and told me that I had to leave him. My dumb ass felt sorry for him and totally fell for his contrite act. This argument ended with ME starting therapy and him claiming that he would go back to AA. 

He supposedly started going to these early morning AA meetings across town, but every time he would go he was gone for a long time, much longer than needed for a meeting. One time he made a small side comment to me about how he drove past so many prostitutes on the way to the meetings, and now I really think that’s what he was up to and why he was gone for so long. He would often do this to people: give them a small hint about something he was doing that he knew he wasn’t supposed to be. I think it gave him a thrill to almost admit to something but not be caught. I wish I could think of other examples now. 

Something weird that happened during this time is that a random undergrad on campus got fixated on me and started cornering me at the gym. This part is kind of a blur for me. I told my husband that he was stalking me, because that’s how it felt?? Looking back I don’t know why I blew things so far out of proportion, I think I was actually afraid of my husband but I projected my fears onto this guy. I took it so far as to file a police report/protection order and tried (successfully) to get him kicked off campus. The only thing he’d done was have the nerve to speak to me while I was trying to use the exercise bike a couple of times. I feel like my husband egged me on with prosecuting him.... I guess? Or was it all me? I was so confused at this point. I should have been focusing my anger on my husband but instead I took it out on this poor weirdo. I mean, it did turn out that he had put his hands on an underage girl who was visiting campus as well, but it wasn’t really my fight and he never touched me. 

We never talked about the stalking incident again after it was over, but we moved back to our original town and commuted to grad school instead of living on campus like we had been. This was the first part of 2007. He gradually eased away from AA and started drinking again. We were living with my narc mom and the two of them hit it off fabulously, he would chat with her while I was off doing other stuff and she told him EVERYTHING about my life (past loves, childhood issues, etc)... things that he would later use against me. She enabled his drinking whenever she got the chance. 

We went to NYC for spring break that year and I started having these random crying jags. I had started taking cymbalta for my “depression” which was really just sadness and fear due to my situation. When I would cry he would become enraged and scream at me that my meds weren’t “working.” I don’t remember much about this trip except for the feeling of crying all the time, and one evening when he decided that he wanted some really rough sex and hurt me. I remember sitting in the bathtub afterwards listening to Cat Power, not knowing what to do. We decided to get a dog when we got back home. 

After the semester ended, he got a part time job at a bagel place and started buying weed and Adderall from one of his coworkers. The first time he brought the weed home, he lied and told me that he found it on the ground behind the bagel place and that some drug dealer probably dropped it in a panic. I believed him because I was still dumb and naive as hell. The Adderall made him so much worse. One day he told me that he was going to start seeing a therapist because he, quote, couldn’t stop fantasizing about raping me. That when he saw me walking around on campus he just wanted to push me down and rape me, he wanted to choke me during sex, etc. I didn’t know how to react, I was terrified. 

He found a female therapist on campus and apparently the two of them talked about ME every session - he would come home and tell me that his therapist says that my depression is self-induced, and even that she says I probably didn’t contract the HPV that I suddenly had from him, and that I could have gotten it anywhere.... wtf!!! 

So I was living in constant fear that I was trying to ignore. He started choking me during sex (therapist approved, supposedly) and I felt like a had to put up with it because otherwise I was a “prude.” We moved out of my mom’s house into our own place and the abuse got worse. He started regularly taking enough Adderall to stay up for 3 days straight, and he would  look at violent and disgusting pornography all night long. He would wake me up and force me to watch his favorite scenes with him. Everything was about sex at that point. He would write these sex stories that starred all of my friends and coworkers, just sexualizing everyone in my life. He would draw pictures of me being gang raped and proudly show them to me. For Easter 2008 he got me an Easter basket filled with porn videos, handcuffs and bondage rope. I was not and am not a kinky person! 

One day he was driving us somewhere and he started frantically talking about how I needed to leave him and go be with a woman because I was obviously a closeted lesbian...??? I don’t know where he got this from but for some reason it was suddenly urgent. I’ve never been with another woman, but he had been with men in his past. Looking back, I think he was telling me this because he had cheated on me with a guy and was projecting. 

Summer 2008 we went on a cruise with his family and it was an absolute nightmare for me. I’ve never felt so trapped. He stumbled into our cabin one night super drink and high on Adderall and demanded that I have violent sex with him. For the first time, he slapped me across the face repeatedly while raping me. He called me horrible names and told me he was going to take my clothes and drop me off in an alleyway naked. He threatened to cut my face with a knife. 

When we returned from the cruise, I kept experiencing shortness of breath. Turns out I was having panic attacks, so they just upped my medication like nothing else was wrong. He demanded to know why I couldn’t be a fun, outgoing person like his cousin from the cruise...???

Spring 2009 we were applying to PhD programs together and took a spring break trip to Mexico with our graduate program. My mental health was definitely getting worse, and I was having a lot of trouble focusing on the scholarly aspects of the trip. At this point I was in survival mode. I don’t think he brought enough Adderall on the trip to keep his addiction happy and he had terrible moodswings the whole time. He would, every month, use up all of the Adderall before his next script would be filled and would spend 5 days in bed “sick” (really too exhausted to function). By the end of this trip he was “sick” and had to spend a few days laying around hotel rooms. One night I asked him for affection and he beat me up and raped me with our professor and other students in the next rooms.

We were together for 6 more years after that but I can’t write anymore today and will have to do a part 2. This stuff is hard for me to share because of how naive and passive I was. My life is 1000% better since I left him in 2015, but I lost 9 years of myself to this asshole. After the Mexico trip it became clear to him that I was breaking down from his abuse and so he went on a campaign of trying to convince me that I was the one who initiated the rough sex and that I wanted it. He told me that I couldn’t be abused because I wasn’t innocent. He was an absolute monster. 

For part 2 I will have to include:

How in December 2009 he manipulated me by telling me about his childhood abuse when I caught him red-handed cheating. How he turned the entire graduate department against us in 2010. How my narc mom took him in after I kicked him out in 2011.",orangeappled1979,2019-03-30 18:41:44,3,2406,36.42,57.9,54.08,3.52,18.8,15.38,93.14,60.1,22.15,16.87,8.48,1.41,0.04,6.73,0.21,5.24,4.74,14.55,8.77,5.24,7.27,1.66,18.58,3.82,1.91,1.5,2.04,2.08,5.4,1.54,3.87,0.79,1.41,0.58,13.38,1.04,0.37,0.62,7.07,10.97,2.2,1.75,1.54,1.79,1.62,2.33,1.91,0.75,0.46,0.67,3.12,0.58,1.16,0.96,0.33,7.77,3.12,1.16,2.04,1.33,0.5,10.43,4.95,0.62,16.87,2.45,7.15,7.52,2.16,1.04,0.67,0.71,0.04,0,0.5,0.37,0.08,0,0.04,0,12.55,5.78,2.62,0.17,0,0.46,0.25,0.25,0.67,1.37,0.75,0.25

b7kqmi,Devastated and isolated by the feeling that no one can understand,"I have been suffering a lot lately to the point where I dropped out of school and have been feeling suicidal again. I am incredibly upset on the daily by the feeling that no one can understand what I went through or what I'm going through now.

After my trauma happened I had many friends who were very heavily involved in the situation and gave me a lot of support. But over the past few months it feels like everyone has moved on while I have been getting steadily worse. It feels like no one realizes how terrible I have actually been doing and everyone is surprised and unsure of what to do when I show it. 

Trauma is tearing me apart every day and I feel very alone with it. I feel like no one can ever possibly understand the severity of what happened or how much it has affected me. It is an incredibly isolating feeling. I have been avoiding hanging out with people more and more.

I am lucky to have one friend who has told me and proven over and over again that he is here for me and willing to offer support absolutely any time I need it. But we are on different schedules so can't really see each other and mostly text. It helps so much to talk to him but I have trouble reaching out often because the things I need to talk about are so heavy.

I have also been going to a support group and have my intake appointment for a therapist next week. So I hope I'm on the right track.

b7ml3z,Repetitive thoughts from past bad trip,"This might be a long read but I just need to talk about it and I never really want to because I don't want to feel like I'm complaining about having it worse or need to share to make me happy. I just don't know what to do. I'm broke, i feel there's no cheap way to get counseling, and that I'm stuck in my life because I deserve being this way. It's gonna sound crazy and that's another reason I don't want to talk about it, but sometimes I feel like I'm either in Hell and I'm being punished for my sins by living them every day or thay existence is just me and the being of good and bad. I'm scared to talk about it and I'm scared of close ones in fear of them being something evil or manipulative. This fear started after having a bad trip a little over a year ago. I tripped in front of my ex and her twin and as one might imagine in was pretty frightening. I thought maybe one was the being of good and the other of evil. It should be known that before I had met her, i was a clean person, against drugs including weed. But ever since then, things click and make sense in different ways, there's been so many coincidences that will just terrorize me and I'll go through the day thinking on it and it makes me feel like I've wasted my day. At first after it happened I barely slept, i over reacted to a lot of things, slept with a knife, barely slept, etc. Even now I'll have nightmares, like tonight that I will see the beginning of my bad trip which started with my hand in a fist coming up to my face uncontrollably and progressively opening my fingers straight up, having my right hand open as a high five or something pointing to the left with the tip of my thumb on the tip of my nose. After this originally red and green circled the room but now there's a circling motion and I'll dream of me trying to wake up or ask someone for help but everyone doesn't believe me or is mad with my as my life flashes forward. I finally will be able to wake up and it feels like my first breath in years. If not a life time... I'm scared of everyone. I'm scared of my existence, I'm too broke for help and  I'm scared this will bottle up and turn into anger and I hate being an angry person. I started going to church a monthish after it originally happened and I still go but lately it's been hard for me to go because it's been coming back and it makes me not believe in my religion. I want to believe in God but I'm scared of any other outcome. I'm scared of going to hell. I'm scared I'm already in hell. I'm scared I'm a horrible person for having these problems or for being scared my reality could be fake and God could be fake and I'm just. Scared. I want to move on in life and be happy. I want successful relationships, i want to live anger free, i want to be successful but I'm scared that my life will never get past this. And I fear I'll blame the ptsd for this.",AnnihilatorHowe,2019-03-31 04:02:37,1,577,29.24,6.38,97.62,1,21.37,11.27,95.84,61.7,20.62,13.69,13,0,0,0.35,0.35,6.93,4.16,16.29,12.82,5.37,8.67,1.56,23.22,7.11,2.77,0.35,0.87,1.04,9.36,1.56,7.8,3.29,1.73,0.35,3.99,0,0,0.35,0,14.56,2.77,2.08,2.6,3.64,1.04,4.16,2.77,0.52,0.35,1.56,3.29,1.91,1.39,0,0,6.24,1.04,1.04,2.77,1.04,1.04,4.51,14.56,3.12,15.94,2.77,6.93,6.76,0.69,0.17,0.17,0.35,1.39,0,0.87,0.52,0.17,0,0,0,13.69,4.85,2.77,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.07,0,0

One I can’t seem to stop, where I can usually stop other panic attacks. I think getting too high makes me feel too powerless, and as a rape victim, especially who has been raped that way..by being under the influence of cannabis and other drugs at the time, it’s hard to overcome the sense of panic. I was about to throw away my whole life and do drugs until I overdosed. Things were going very bad in my life and I didn’t know how or honestly care how to cope back then. It led to me being homeless and getting gang raped by a pack of homeless, also under the influence men in a dumpster enclosure.

b7r8hw,I realized I don’t feel helpless when triggered; I feel like a freak. The unlovable abnormal kid that deserved to be abused by biological/foster/adoptive family and partners. Bullied by everyone with no friends growing up. I don’t mind feeling helpless. I just want to feel normal.,"I started talking about how other guys tend to be really pushy (rough housing) and how much it affects me. People asked me why I just don’t tell them to stop and I realized I don’t want them to stop I just want to be ok with it. They do it to everyone, why stick out and ask them to treat me differently? Why am I defective? 


I’ve always been like this. I was brought home at three years old after severe abuse by biological and first foster family, and eventually when my adoptive mother suffered from a mental illness I was abused by her. Pretty badly as well, to the point that my friends hate her more than anyone else even tho they’ve been raped or abused themselves. 


They brought me home and my sister tried to hug her new sibling but I bit her. Then I screamed for days. Nothing they did could get me to sleep or stop screaming. I didn’t talk much either. They thought I would actually be intellectually disabled but I ended up being pretty smart, so I grew up as one of those gifted kids that didn’t live up to their potential lol. I caught up really quickly in terms of speaking and reading, academics. Never socially though. 


Every single day I was bullied by kids. Every day I was lonely. And at the end of the day I would come home to be bullied by my mom and have her tell me that people were mean to me because I was wierd. And I was gonna be crazy like my biological parents and no one will love me because of it. 


She would punish me for a large list of things. she used to dig through the trash to see evidence of eating something you weren’t supposed to. Or deleting texts because she was supposed to be able to read them all. She smashed my adult brothers computer with a hammer because he didn’t give her the password even tho *he bought the laptop*. She’d punish me at first by not giving me clean clothes but eventually by putting them in the washer not dryer so I’d have to wear them wet. Put dieting pills in my food is probably the worst one. I am very proud of myself for moving out early and living totally independently from someone who controlled every thing I ate, wore, did, even couldn’t shower without her approval. It was hell. Once in third grade I drank water and held it til I cried and the teacher asked why I didn’t just ask to the use the restroom and I said because it’s my fault for drinking water...


I would go home after being treated badly and over analyze everything about the day, the way I was positioned in space, every single word I said. Sometimes I would memorize books on body language to try and position myself correctly and understand what people were saying to me. So, of course, when someone showed even the slightest interest in me in eighth grade, I thought that person loved me. I thought he was a saint for putting up with me. Then when he raped me, I thought he had to do it. If I were normal I’d want to have sex, so he wouldn’t have to force it. I was in this horribly abusive “relationship” for nine months. I went to the doctor for a checkup and they saw injuries/anal tearing. They had to report this. they reported it to the police which were his friends. These police asked if I liked it rough, if I was into BDSM, if I orgasmed. They asked me if I said no and concluded that he must not have heard me (because I was suffocating and it was hard to speak). I had injuries and any evidence you could need but all he had to say was that it was consensual bdsm. Then he tried to drown me as punishment for talking to the police. I moved states with my family and starting over at that point people kind of liked me in high school. I did really well in school,  then I went to college. Got into another relationship where we both had less than healthy behaviors. 

This entire time I have kept thinking that I struggle in relationships simply because I was raped by someone. People who are raped struggle with relationships so it was easy to say all my problems were from him. Of course, he was a lot of the problem. But I was lying to myself when I said he was the cause of my intimacy issues when since the day I was brought home I lashed out at people trying to touch me. I was also lying to myself, but to a lesser degree, when I said my adoptive mom caused the  issue by causing me to date my abuser. 

It’s not that simple. This goes back to the day I was born into a shitty family and abused to the point of being socially behind.Layers of issues peeled back. It’s honestly at the core of who I am. I don’t know if that’s fixable to be honest

b7sylq,"Trauma recurring, seeking advice. NSFW Tw* [sexual assault]","Recurrent smells tastes and feelings. Unending. It's clear to me that I am blinded to of and from myself but that seems to be of little concern to doctors or anyone else and I've lost hope. So depression, yes. I feel abandoned and abused. Continuously. Everyday is traumatic or in fear of more. Every time I lie down it begins again and I don't even make the decision to lie down. But it becomes total blackness. The the tastes and feelings of begin again. It also happens when I sit or any other time. I feel kept from reaching out or contacting others, even reporting it. 

It’s not only interoception of, but that happens as well. There is no reprieve. There isn’t a single moment where my body, if not my mind is over focused on the awareness that it *will* happen again, even if the situation is safe. 

It’s become so bad that I can’t talk about it or at all. But I keep trying. I’m working on developing my treatment plan and finding a therapist, but anyone with real resources or coping skills would be awesome. 

I’ve been trying so hard for so long and I’m exhausted physically from constant fight or flight responses, emotionally, mentally I’m not a part of anything anymore. Just a hollow formless response, continuing to try to make it back to some part of life instead of like like absence and what feels to me, not only like derealization, depersonalization, and possibly an abduction, but is hopelessly ignored every time I talk with any professionals or have. And I make a point of mentioning it every time because nobody seems to ask about it. 

I’m kept from appointments, making phone calls, hearing my voice and it’s articulations, and interactively. I’ve tried calling crisis lines and feel kept from hearing or feeling present, even when I know I have. I know I’ve called again today, in tears, gasping, but could hear none of it. At all. I feel worse than forgotten, I feel I know I am and have been abandoned. Even if a part of my blinded soul feels and know that it could be untrue. 

The days look and feel, and artificially so, extremely short, uselessly almost present. Just like me. Only for use by someone else, no matter how unwanted it is. 

I know in another life I’ve written similar and made progress. And in yet another, still kept from progress. 

I need more than the tiniest amounts of motivation I try to continue to want to exist until the next task and goal I set for myself. Unable to remember them cognitively anyway.

She let me know that he house was full of people and suggested I come tomorrow instead. I felt so hurt until it was pointed out to me that she was trying to keep me from being in a difficult and uncomfortable situation (including possible triggers) and provided me a better alternative. 

I did the same thing with my boss- she asked me how I was and I thought it was because I was doing my job poorly. She had to explain to me in plain English that she could tell I was struggling and wanted to know if there was anything she could do to assist me in making my job doable, or if I needed to take the day (I have FMLA as I’m I’m the middle of a flare).

Last night I thought they were coming true.,"It should be noted that my PTSD didn’t occur from somebody following me to my apartment. The only thing that I can think is that I’ve always been afraid of my abusive ex finding out where I live. That and the fact that I live alone in a two bedroom apartment make me nervous sometimes. 

***

I was at my parents’ house for Spring Break all week. A couple of nights I had nightmares. I would dream that I was walking home and some man followed me. Or I would dream he’d randomly show up. Or else he’d already be in my apartment when I got back. 

Each nightmare ended okay. I would either fight him off, my FWB (who is a cop) would randomly show up and fight them off, or I’d wake up. 

Last night (around 10pm) I got back into town. I live in the upper half of a duplex. I thought my downstairs neighbors were still out of town—I missed their cars on the street and all the outside lights were off. 

I grabbed my book bag and keys for my first trip up to my apartment. (It should be noted that while I wasn’t thinking of the bad dreams at that moment, most of the nightmares occurred on these steps or in the doorway, at night.) I get halfway up when my neighbor says, “Oh hey!”

I nearly dropped all my stuff while I screamed “Jesus Fucking Christ!” because he startled me so bad. He started nervously laughing and saying something (probably apologizing—because what else do you do when you accidentally startled somebody?). At this point I still can’t pin where his voice is coming from, what he’s saying, or who it is while I’m looking in every direction in the dark, scrambling up the stairs, and literally wordlessly SCREAMING. 

The whole thing lasted less than 30 seconds because I realized who it was and where they were. (One of the entrances to their apartment is under the steps I take up to my apartment. He was in that doorway.)

Dude did nothing wrong and I actually apologized to him. But if I had actually seen him out of the corner of my eye or something, I’m afraid I might have actually hurt him.

Naturally, I immediately left for the bar, where I ran into my FWB and told him what happened. I’m happy he was able to keep me company last night.",dinosaur_apocalypse,2019-03-31 14:48:17,0,427,25.4,22.68,99,1,14.72,17.1,95.78,60.42,24.59,17.56,12.88,0,0.47,3.04,1.17,7.03,4.45,12.41,10.07,4.92,6.56,0.94,18.03,3.04,0.94,3.04,1.17,2.58,6.09,0.94,5.15,1.41,0.94,0.7,10.3,0.23,1.17,0,3.28,12.88,1.41,0.94,1.64,4.68,1.87,4.22,3.75,1.64,1.64,0.47,2.11,0.47,0.7,0.7,0.23,6.09,1.17,0.47,2.81,0.94,0.7,7.03,6.32,0.7,21.31,2.34,12.18,7.03,0.47,1.17,3.51,0,0.47,0,1.87,0.23,0.47,0.23,0.23,0,16.63,6.32,2.81,0,0,0.23,0.47,0,0.94,2.81,2.34,0.7
b7tlw4,"NSFW :I hate the word ""trigger"" but know I have to address my personal triggers.","TW: sexual abuse

I hate how people have taken the word ""triggered"" and used it for anything they don't agree with, are angered by, upset by, etc. It makes me not want to try to address my triggers because I feel like if I try to say this is a trigger, I'm grouped in with those easily offended.

I got diagnosed recently but have been struggling for a while. 90% of the time when I try to have sex with my husband it ends in a panic attack. I've also learned that while hearing about most sexual assault or seeing it on TV shows (I've always loved crime shows) I'm perfectly fine. It's when I hear about people who's stories mirror mine. Basically, I had a bf who wouldn't let me say no to sex and if I tried I was manipulated to believe I had to. When I confronted him he told me ""I can't help it, my dick has a brain of its own"". Apparently if he's horny he's not to be held accountable for his actions. After sex I was basically tossed aside and he turned away. It's more complicated but that's besides the point.

First time I really realized I need to actually start to identify and avoid my triggers was the latest Shane Dawson video. While mine had nothing to do with human trafficking, a lot of what she said really resonated with me. I'm pretty sure my ex had tried to get me pregnant (we were in high school) and told me he was disappointed that I wasnt pregnant when I had a scare (I was 17 at the time..). I couldn't help but imagine what would have happened if he had succeeded. It's like a double edged sword because it's validating knowing that what I went through wasn't normal and how I'm feeling isnt just regretting a normal bad relationship BUT after watching the video I had a dissociation episode and kept having flashbacks and panic attacks for a few days.

Some of my triggers have been really stupid things my husband has graciously helped with. One was just the act of turning over to sleep after sex. Full on flashback followed by panic attack. Now every time we have sex he asks me what I need from him and what's ok. I feel awful he has to cater to these things because of someone else.

I also have trauma from my childhood which has been newly fresh and harder to pinpoint triggers because weird things will trigger a memory and cause an emotional flashback.

So now I don't know if I meet any new friends how to even introduce something because I feel like if I say ""hey, that's a trigger for me"" it'll be taken as I just don't like that thing. 

This is really drawn out, sorry about that.

But has anyone else had trouble dealing with figuring out and addressing triggers? How do you do it?",luagin,2019-03-31 15:21:48,0,512,15.84,18.98,60.89,1.42,18.96,16.6,94.14,60.55,21.68,14.06,10.94,0.39,0.2,2.34,0.2,7.62,4.3,12.3,13.09,5.47,8.79,2.54,22.07,5.08,2.34,3.12,0.98,1.76,7.62,2.15,5.27,1.37,2.15,0.59,9.38,0.78,0.39,0.2,2.73,17.97,3.12,4.69,2.73,3.91,0.98,5.08,3.52,1.17,1.17,0.98,2.93,0.78,0.59,2.15,0,6.84,2.34,1.56,1.95,1.17,0.59,7.42,13.09,0.39,8.59,0.78,2.73,5.08,0.78,0.59,0.39,0.2,0,0,1.37,0.2,0.39,0.39,0,0,15.62,5.27,1.76,0.39,0,0.39,0,0,1.56,4.88,1.17,0.2
b7tna2,Can unwanted help be a trigger?,I have zero self esteem and I don't think I am better than anyone. I often ask for help when I can't figure things out. Some reason when people try to give me advice sometimes It instantly causes me to react in a way that is not myself. I'm curious. Can this actually be a trigger or do I have an un dealt with ego issue? My SO tries to offer suggestions and help but it crosses me as critcism and unnecessary.

b7tta8,Complex PTSD from daily child abuse,"A very shortened version of my backstory is that I was abused by both parents in every way that someone can hurt another. These creatures did bizarre, unusual and cruel things to me. Unspeakable things. For the sake of not making any of you lovely supportive people lose your lunch, I'm going to tell one of my less bad stories. That's all I'm comfortable with at the moment. 
Before doing so, I would like to mention that I currently have a wonderful and safe life. I have a wonderful husband and a loving family through him. I am also seeking counseling and am on antidepressants to help with my Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Also, both of them are in prison for other bad things they've done.
Well, here it is.
I was trying to eat my lunch. Meals for me were not completely assured. They were for my brothers, but my mom thought that my frail underweight self was overweight, so she would starve me sometimes. I never knew when she was going to.
Anyway, a game they loved to play with me was to do something that would make anyone angry, then laugh at my anger and hit me, knowing I was too small to defend myself. One of these things was coming up to me and randomly taking my plate of food. If I got mad (who wouldn't?), they would laugh and say ""oh look she's food aggressive!"" Then when I would start crying they would laugh more and throw my food away as ""punishment for showing anger"" because it was ""disrespectful"". So after that, when they would do it I would try to not be angry. I would try to play along and fake laugh about it. They would point out that my laugh was fake (no shit!) and then throw my food away anyway. One time, I decided I was tired of it. I asked them to please let me eat. There was still food left over and I could have gotten myself another plate. But nope! 
""If you're so starving, here, eat your food."" And they would point at my plate in the trash. I was so hungry I ate it. I feel so gross. 
Another time, they showed me starving children in Africa to prove to me that I don't need to eat, since I don't look like that. 
Wow. Reliving this really brought up a lot of emotions. I'm not sure what my goal for posting this was. Maybe to get some peace by sharing this with someone other than my husband. 
Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

b7tywd,Trying to find work after years of hiatus due to my mental health - terrified and disheartened,"I'm desperately trying to rebuild my life after two years of sitting on the disability allowance, trying to work out my sexual trauma and grief. It's been hard but I finally managed to get myself out of bed every day to go to a course for hospitality (an industry I had previously worked in) so that I would have something to say for myself, so that I could start feeling normal, functional, make money to pay my own way.
 Applying for work is always hard, even when you haven't had a two year break, but I feel like a bottom-of-the-barrel kind of option. I find it very hard to sell myself, to tell people that I'm good at what I do. Despite that I managed to write a CV and cover letters and have applied for countless jobs advertised online, but not a single person has even responded to turn me down, let alone ask for an interview. I feel like I'm going to have to set the bar lower, apply for someplace depressing and stressful and high traffic, like a McDonald's, but I know my mental health won't be able to cope with that kind of environment. I know that no matter where I go, I'm going to have nightmares about it. I'm already trying to cope with dreaming about my god damn tutor from my course sexually assaulting me (which never occurred in reality).

Should I write in my CV that I took a hiatus due to illness? Should I call people? Has anyone been in this situation who might be able to give me some advice/encouragement?

b7xnyq,The Next Chapter,"Ill do my best to keep this short but... I make no promises.

Background: am queer, have pstd from abusive partners who were also queer.

Today is a sort of holiday in the queer community. Popular enough that every person I know brought it up today. Its also the (2 year) anniversary of the worst part of my life. Two years ago, on this holiday, I asked a girl out. She was the worst thing to ever happen to me.

I was abused. Made to be afraid of her. Threatened with physic torture. Had loaded guns pointed at me. She was always so angry. So much yelling and screaming. I could go for a long time.

The holiday is an 'opposite' holiday; a month prior is remembrance of those of us who have died, today is the celebration of those who lived. Which is depressingly ironic because... I shouldn't be alive. I've attempted 3 times, had a loaded gun pointed at me, have significant physical health problems.... I just statistically shouldn't be alive. On a day to celebrate living.

Today... I didn't cry. I didn't have a have a panic attack. I smiled, and reminded my friends I didn't like this holiday.
Tomorrow, I'm going to a job that I enjoy, with people who may not understand, but they accept me and my limitations.
Wednesday, I am starting therapy again.

I feel like, after seven years, I'm finally putting my life back together. It feels... weird.

b88crx,Medical Side Effects Broke My Brain,"Hey all. I have PTSD (verbally diagnosed in my latest session as C-PTSD, but that's not on paper yet) and I'm on Sertraline for it. The sertraline seemed to be working for a little bit (2 weeks or so) and then the side effects started. 

I have nightmares and increased anxiety, my insomnia is kicking my ass (recently been unable to sleep til 4-5am), I've been to A&amp;E and the local crisis support for the suicidal thoughts and the self harm urges. I'm getting increased flashbacks and my (slowly built up) trust has vanished. I'm constantly on edge. 

They're discussing taking me off of it, which is good I think, but it's left me currently in the worst mental health space I've been in for years. Probably only because I can now recognise there are issues. I'm also on a waiting list for DBT and coping skills etc, with the eventual goal of getting into trauma councilling. 

I just want to know, outside of therapy and relying on other people for support, how do you deal with being in a really shitty place?

b8a6do,Veteran with ptsd.,"Hi! 
I'm in desperate need of help/answers.
My fiance of 6 years has PTSD from the Military. 
For the past two years it has spiralled down hill.

His stance is, he only smokes weed. It's his medicine. Our state is illegal.

The past year our fights have grown in frequency and intensity.
 But the past few months have been Detremental to us and our two kids. 
Our fights are fierce. He packs his stuff and leaves.
When he does return he has smoked and returned to ""normal"" 
He then gets upset that I am still angry about earlier.

Last year I had a depression breakdown and finally sought a psychiatrist. Instead of MDD I was diagnosed BP II And ADD. The switch to mood stabilizers and ADD meds has changed me 360°
He's never seen me so easy going and happy.

I've been trying endlessly to convince him to get the right help and properly medicated. His defense is ""he's tried all of them, they don't work""

So on top of not wanting to get the needed help, and staying miserable he of course blames me for his misery. That I bitch and he can't stand me. 
A year ago I would of agreed, BUT like I said I'm a whole different person. 
In reality, he does nothing but complain. He snaps at everything and everyone. Blames us for his woes. Is constantly paranoid I'm cheating because I work at a bar..And God forbid he hasn't smoked, we all tip toe around him. He doesn't see it but then makes it me that does everything wrong...

In my stablish mind I know he's blaming me but he only does so because he's so sick he's making me the target.

I'm at my wit's end. My fiance is a shell of a man he once was. I hardly see him laugh. He stays in his phone away from the world. He sees no happiness, and feels no joy. Its breaking me because I know he loves me.

b8as54,I have a scenario going on,"Part of my PTSD is from physical abuse. I am pretty good nowadays at setting boundaries and sticking to them.

So one of my friends has started playfully hitting me lately. I really do not think she means it to be mean spirited. It seems to be something that a lot of women do... she's never mad when she does it. It's more so when she's laughing or shocked or perhaps if I make a joke and she's all like ""omg you didn't!""

The part that freaks me out the most is that this has happened like 15 times and I don't say a single word when it happens. No ""please don't hit me"" no ""why'd you do that"" no ""you don't have to touch me to get your point across."" I just don't say anything about it.

Does this say something about myself that I would still allow myself to be abused if it were to happen? I'd always like to think I'd never let anyone abuse me again, but if I let my friend playfully hit me, why the hell wouldn't I let it escalate? I don't even know if I should say something to her, because I'm sure she'd feel horrible if I made it seem like what she's doing is similar to the abuse I had experienced or something like that.",Sushisavage,2019-04-01 15:59:02,0,231,1.41,10.48,48.53,19.32,16.5,12.12,96.1,69.7,27.71,17.32,11.69,0,1.73,3.46,0.43,10.39,3.46,10.82,17.32,7.79,7.79,5.63,26.84,3.03,3.46,2.6,1.3,3.03,7.36,3.46,3.9,0.43,2.6,0,9.09,0,0.87,3.9,0,19.05,3.46,2.6,3.46,8.66,2.16,5.19,3.46,0,2.16,0.87,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,2.16,0.87,0,0.43,0.87,0,2.6,19.05,0.43,7.36,0.43,2.16,4.76,0,1.3,0,0,0.87,0,1.3,0.87,0.43,0,0,0,18.61,5.19,1.3,0,0,0.87,0.43,0,3.46,7.36,0,0

b8bob8,Fear of the future,"So, today was the hardest day since I read my statement in court in front of my ex husband.

So today I got email notifying me that what I thought I had for time in being safe was much shorter than I had anticipated.

Here I thought I would have at least 5 or 10  years to be safe and truly build a new life only to find out that he could be out in 3 to 6 due to statutory release. 

I've been in full panic mode, crying, hyperventilating, shaking. Luckily, I do have a wonderful support system around me but it doesn't always help with the future planning.

I wonder if I should run to another country or do I stay and try not to fear him trying to take my life again. I feel that either decision he has the control  I hate feeling like this...

b8c17j,"After a long time of feeling frustrated by lack of progress in therapy, I finally told my therapist something that turned it all around","Disclaimer: I began therapy less than a year ago and have only ever been to one therapist, so my experience is very limited. I have no idea if this will help others or apply to anyone else's situation, but since reading it would have helped me, I thought I'd give it a shot.

For the longest time I felt like my therapist basically chatted with me, gave me compliments (telling me how strong I was, etc) and just told me what I wanted to hear. This made me angry and so many times I would leave our sessions thinking ""I don't need compliments, I need *help!* I could tell I wasn't getting anywhere, but everyone I talked to who had been to therapy kept telling me that it takes time and I just needed to be patient.

I got so frustrated that I was one session away from switching to someone else. I worked up my courage a little bit, went into the session, and said ""I'm frustrated with my lack of progress. I feel like you are treating me carefully, like I am fragile and ready to break at a moment's notice. Telling me I'm strong makes me feel good temporarily, but then I leave and I'm still in this deep black hole. I need you to push me out of my comfort zone. I need to know, is there a way I can make faster progress?""

Stupidly, I was afraid this would somehow offend her. Instead, without batting an eye, she simply said ""Yes. We can delve deeper into your trauma and start getting into the heavy stuff. That is the fastest way for you to make progress. I wasn't sure if you were ready."" For the rest of that session and for subsequent sessions, she completely changed her whole demeanor/approach. And let me tell you, it was (and continues to be) so, so shitty. It's been hard. But I'm in a better place, I can feel the sadness slowly lifting, and I actually feel like I'm making progress now. 


I'm so glad I didn't switch therapists before saying that. It almost didn't even occur to me as a thing I should say.

b8csoa,Self Sabotage...Symptom of PTSD,"I was diagnosed with PTSD almost year ago, due to physical, mental, and emotional abuse from my family/significant other &amp; several other incidences that have occurred in my life. I have tried cutting people out of my life that I know are harmful to me and try to surround myself with friends that are continuously supportive of me and my goals in life. Everything will be great for awhile and I will be positive, &amp; just living life. However..just like that everything can change and i go into self sabotage mode. I push away the people that love me and support me and I let the people that I know are bad and will tear me down in and take to heart what they have to say about me and who I am as a person. 
I really struggle with positive comments in regard to myself, and usually end up crying when people say nice things to me, because it's uncomfortable. I instead would rather hear the hurtful comments. Is it self sabotage because I have control of who I let into my life, and already have cut those individuals out?? and i choose to let them back in at times just to hear the hurtful comments?? I recently did it because I had a major job interview and almost needed to hear that I would fail and not be offered the job. I hate that I'm like this.. and I don't know how one overcomes something like that..has anybody else experienced this???? Does it get better? How did you change this mentality?? i struggle relationships wise because positive comments/gestures upset me. It makes me feel like I'll never be normal..

b8e6ga,Struggling to find the use of exposure therapy.,"I’m in a PTSD treatment program. I have a therapist that does EMDR with me twice/week and an Occupational therapist that does exposure therapy with me once/week. I also have a kinesiologist who works on physical health everyday and we do 3-4 educational classes/week plus 2 group meetings/week. 

I’m finding EMDR therapy really is helping. I’ve created a container, a calm place and started other folders for stuff that’s stressful and other motivational folders for things I have trouble doing (like going to this program). We’ve come up with my First trauma, my Worst trauma and my Latest trauma that we are going to process. We did a practice one on a minor event that happened just to practice- I chose when on the 15th birthday my bf at the time didn’t even call me and blew me off the whole weekend. It’s never something that’s been earth shattering but it makes me sad. So we started processing it and the first time she did it I had the biggest rush of a wave of sadness flood over me that I just hurt into tears- and then I had to laugh because it felt like she brain Ninja’d me. I felt like the gates opened and just a flood of emotion. We did it a few more times and by the end I left so relaxed and free and my calf muscles had completely relaxed in the most amazing way... I didn’t even realize they were tense. I think this is how it’s supposed to go??? It seems surreal now, even though it was only a week ago but what a cool therapy. 

Physical health directly correlates with mental health I believe, so working out every day with my trainer and feeling stronger physically helps fill me up my tank before the stress of the days agenda and more intense mental therapies. 

It’s nice doing group educational classes/meetings because it’s reassuring to hear from other people in the similar situations reacting similar. 

The exposure therapy. Basically my OT takes me to someplace where it’s disturbing enough that it triggers my anxiety. We started with the local coffee shop last week. Now here are her rules:

-sit at the table with no distractions. No books, phone, making convo etc
-no using calming techniques such as scents, headphones, closing eyes and deep breathing
-no safety behaviours such as fiddling or hats, sunglasses, hoods
-be present and acknowledge the anxiety and think about how it feels

Do this for 45ish minutes while my OT sits beside me, watching me, occasionally asking how I’m feeling. 

First one last week was at the coffee shop and honestly- it was super annoying. She made me take off my hat, sit there and just think about anxious I am. I got to about a 7/10 just from sitting there being watched not allowed to do anything. 

Today was the second and we started out at the mall and there was nothing going on so we went to the hospital ER entrance. Again, sit there and think about how anxious I am. With her sitting beside me watching. All above rules apply. I got to a 8 when this (for lack of better terms/description) homeless/addicted looking male kept hovering around, asked me for cigarettes. Otherwise it was an easy 4-5/10 on the anxiety scale. 

It’s just fucking annoying. Of course I’m going to be anxious just sitting there in silence with a stranger observing me while I’m not allowed to even so much as fiddle with my fucking keys. How is this helpful????? 

I understand the theory- basically to make my brain remember no matter how anxious I get it will pass, I won’t die and eventually my system wears out and exhausts itself and gets too tired to be anxious.

But the things that are causing me the anxiety aren’t able to be produced- my triggers aren’t going to recall on demand. She’s asked me what my triggers are and it’s not like it’s a solid object or place- it’s conflict with people and intense, random, traumatic events that I deal with everyday at work nonstop, could be 10 bad calls one day and only 1 the next... you can’t reproduce that, you literally have to jump right in. She asked me what would be similar to that and honestly nothing touches it- I function with high anxiety on a regular basis, I can do anything running at up to an 8/10 anxiety, which is a lot- heart palps, excessive sweating, mind racing, trouble concentrating, disassociating. This is me most times when I go out and socialize with my spouses friends and family or anyone who isn’t super close friends/family that I trust completely. The only thing that has taken me to a 9-10 is after a really bad call at work (which happens a lot being a paramedic or a dispatcher), a truly traumatic event in my personal life (sisters death/ex suicide attempt), or having to deal with my family (incredibly abusive, manipulative, possibly narcissistic people who I chose to go NC with after my sisters death). 

I guess I’m just frustrated with the exposure therapy because I never feel better after, I always feel wiped and it’s not the “triggers” that are making me nervous it’s the therapist- And not her personally, because I enjoy her when she’s teaching but anyone sitting there observing you doing nothing but being anxious is going to make you anxious so I just don’t understand how it’s going to help me.

b8equb,I dont know who I was (this was longer than I intended),"I was looking through some old pictures of me as a child (ages 5 to 16) and I could not tell you who that child was. It feels like I am looking at a different person. That it can't be me. It doesn't feel like me. I couldn't tell you what I was doing, where I was, or literally anything about the photo (any of them).

 I do have diagnosed PTSD, and disclosed to my therapist 2 of my previous traumas (for the first time ever-to anyone) about one year ago. She thinks there is more that I cannot remember because I have continued nightmares (I cry in my sleep, say ""no"" multiple times-most nights. I wake up breathing heavily and sometimes sweaty. But i do not remember the dreams), flashbacks (I feel unsafe, and kind of a familiarity, like my brain is trying to warn me of something but I can't remember exactly what), and I have a very difficult time with intimacy and sex (those are among a slew of other issues I have tbh). I have tried EMDR but due to how much I do not remember, it was unsuccessful. I have also come to realize in the past 6 months that my mother was emotionally abusive and neglectful when I waa growing up (locked me in my bedroom, called me fat, made fun of me, refused me medical attention, etc etc). And I am already aware of 2 instances of sexual assault or abuse/rape (disclosed one year ago). 

I am not sure how much of this is ""normal"" or how to feel about it at all, actually. I don't know much about PTSD, and there aren't any support groups or anything near me. I feel like no one can understand me. Like I am a freak. I feel alone. I reported the 2 assault/rape instances but one was by an ex gf and bc she is a female and I am a female, they didn't consider it rape. The other was by a pediatrician, and the police told me it was my word against his, and he is very well known and respected in my city.

Maybe I don't feel like I have closure? Maybe there is something I haven't remembered? I have no idea.

b8fhid,Childhood memories coming back,"For venting &amp; support.
W: physical abuse/assault, choking

It's 2 am and I'm trying to distract myself with reading things on Reddit and watching videos. I'm scared to try to go to sleep and be alone with my thoughts. I just need to vent I guess. I talked to my aunt about this yesterday, but it's not any better.

A certain very traumatic memory from my early childhood comes back to me every once in a while, it seems every few years. And it came back a few days ago, more aggressive than ever.

Here's what happened/the scene:

I'm less than 10 years old and my cousin, also younger than 10 I think, but older than me, and I were playing around in a childhood home. We we're playing, nothing rough that I can remember. We were playing and then all of a sudden, in an instant, out of nowhere, his arm is around my neck, putting me in a headlock and he's squeezing his arm back with the aid of his other arm, to tighten around my neck. 

I'm almost immediately screaming for the only other person in the house, my aunt/his mom, who's all the way on the other side of the house, sleeping. All while trying, and failing, to pull his arm from around my neck.

One second we're playing, the very next second, he's choking me with what seems like all of his strength, the very next second I'm trying to pull his arm from me while gasping, crying, and screaming for my aunt, in a split second I realized, as my cousin is older and bigger and stronger than me, that all I could do is scream for help.

I screamed her name twice and he let me go, and I immediately ran to her (she never heard me screaming, of course, I had to go into her room and wake her up).

My cousin's done other stuff to me, he's always been violent, but nothing like this.

It's so scary. The fear I felt back then, every time this memory comes back to me, I feel that same fear.

It's scary being strangled. It's scary trying to free yourself from them, and quickly as you're essentially being killed, but they won't budge. It's scary not knowing if they'll ever let go. It's scary having to resort to just screaming for your life. It's scary for a child to go through.

I can hear her (my child self). I can hear her screaming and crying, I can hear her voice crack as she screams, from her windpipe being close in on. I can feel her *helplessly* trying to pry his arm from her throat. I can feel her fear every time.

This was about 15 years ago and handling the memory hasn't gotten any better.

2 nights ago I was kept up because of it. I couldn't sleep, I was crying for hours. I'm not in any danger now, but that memory is just that powerful.

And I keep getting angrier about it. I've been cordial enough to this cousin all these years, but now I'm so angry, I don't know if I can anymore. I don't think he ever apologized. I don't think I'll ever forgive him even if he did. That was so fucked up. It's such a fucked up thing to do and I can't excuse him just because he was a kid back then, I've never done anything close to the vile shit he's done to me, to him or anyone.

I know it was fucked up, it still is. I know I don't deserve that, no matter what excuse (lie) he gives. No one deserves that, especially not a child. I know I didn't deserve it. But none of that makes me feel *any* better. And that too makes me angry.

I thought I was managing these memories well enough, but they are affecting me worse and worse and I'm thinking that life isn't worth living if I have to remember them like this.

The maximum safety that I've ever felt in my home is ""the dogs aren't barking, so nobody unknown's in here right now"". I got my dog in 2015.

PTSD has become so, so painfully unpredictable. I have lost control over when and where I will get my dissociative flashbacks, and this has destroyed my ability to function in every single aspect of my life. Working has become nearly impossible, and my interpersonal relationships have suffered greatly due to my difficulty in actually pushing myself out of the house. Even when I do accomplish the rare act of miraculously forcing myself into going out with my friends, I find that they always end up having to take on the role of a caregiver because I'm constantly slipping into a flashback—I don't want to do that to the ones I care about. I hate the feeling of dragging my loved ones down the PTSD rabbit hole with me.

b8mu34,How did we arrive here?,"After having two children with an increasingly abusive spouse, (Both spouse and I -came from alcoholism and abuse as a family practice,) I divorced and met a wonderful peaceful, kind man. After years of dating and cohabitation we married. My children, as they entered middle school started to have issues. My son improved. My daughter devolved into a contemptuous relationship with me. From there it got worse. I sought counseling. It did not help my daughter, or our family. 

As my son left for college, 2 years ahead of his sister, things got worse. 

As my daughter was accepted to ALL of her college choices, she had already left a highly successful competitive gymnastics , artistic and academic career. She turned on all that was positive in her life. We blamed the one thing most stood out, her negligent biological dad.  As we settled on and attended a fantastic state college, she started to unravel. 

I returned from a weekend trip with my son, late on a Monday morn, to find my daughter distressed. She returned with her brother, to his firm, and later that Monday, they both returned to tell the tale.

My life was over. 

My daughter told us she had been molested by my husband-their step father, from ages 5,(or so,) til 12. We sought help from SFF and had him arrested that day. 

I spent the next three years supporting my family through this unbelievable mess of a justice system. This was before #Metoo,  the system was difficult to navigate, to say the least.  The DA’s office told me this was my daughters case, she was 18. I could not be involved. They were skeptical  of me, and often treated me like a women trying to get rid of a spouse in any way she could. My daughter was re-traumatized by the DA’d office, who treated the case as a win only case. They didn’t see too much possibility of a win, (“he says-she says is how it is charged when charges are filed so long after the fact,)
We carried on. The DA had the ADA take family leave, my daughter had to start from scratch with s new ADA. Then the original ADA returned. The defendant was allowed every latitude for his defense. Often resulting in further traumatic results for my daughter and her family. 

In the end, we were semi-successful. He was convicted, and deported a few months later. He had never become a naturalized citizen-his mistake. But he was slowed to go back to s country that would welcome him. No punishments.

It is 6 years since his deportation. I am still struggling. My children, now in their upper 30’s, are not flourishing. Returning to therapy feels like returning to trauma, I all the Harry details. One child feels survivors guilt, the other refuses to be called s victim, yet she has not transitioned yo survivor. 

I have been supportive in the 9 years of this mess.

I couldn't go down the ladder and so they nicely switched me to an easier job that didn't involve heights. 

A few hours later I'm making idle conversation with a coworker doing the same job as me and mentioned how this job was pretty boring. It was just an off hand comment like talking about the weather I wasn't trying to start anything. This guy looked me dead in the eyes and says "" well you could have just gone down the ladder"" I was so speechless I didn't even know what to say.

I'm a 21 year old white man and have been treated for acute PTSD 3 years due to several violent encounters on the street. At the time these encounters made me radically racist, and very sexist as well, (policewomen didn't intervene and just walked past), large parts of my day and of my energy where expended in revenge fantasies. The good news was that I managed to get therapy after I realized my behavior was not healthy, picked up some healthy hobbies to channel my anger and was cured, or so I thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last week a colleague of mine was pestering me, no big deal, I can take this when its from friends. But it was different. The moment he touched me, normally this is not a problem, I got extremely angry. I got physical with him, and considered doing something that would definitely have landed me in jail. Of course the fucknut also just had to say I was ""triggered"", (I was, but we're not speaking English, the word ""triggered"" is just known because of memes surrounding PTSD and only used mockingly.) After this, my symptoms have come back, albeit in a milder form. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate what my PTSD has made me, I used to be a sweet, albeit dorky guy. While the racism and sexism is not as bad as it was before, some days I still feel filled to the brim with hatred for these people. But worst of all are the violent fantasies. They are very, very, extreme and sometimes I'm left ruminating for almost 30 minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else here has experience with non-combat PTSD caused by violence? Tips for not ruminating on revenge so much? How do you handle it when people ridicule your condition? What should I do to prevent my condition from slipping further back?",Throwaway5468432,2019-04-02 12:30:55,6,344,37.81,20.78,71.56,1.82,18.11,19.19,83.43,52.62,14.24,9.88,7.85,0.29,0.58,0.58,0.58,4.36,4.07,11.63,9.88,6.98,7.85,2.03,15.99,6.4,3.2,1.74,1.16,1.74,8.72,2.91,5.81,0,3.2,0.58,4.65,0,0.87,0,1.16,12.5,1.45,3.2,1.16,2.33,1.16,3.49,2.03,0.29,0.58,0.58,1.74,0,1.45,0,0.29,5.81,0.87,0.29,1.45,1.74,1.45,6.98,7.27,0.29,13.37,1.16,5.23,7.56,1.16,1.16,0,0,0,0,0.58,0.29,0,0,0.29,0,21.8,4.07,6.69,0.29,2.33,1.16,0,0.29,1.16,1.16,2.33,2.33
b8oeal,Irrational frustrations,"Do you ever just out of no where get short fused and want to explode and beat people? Some times I just get up and walk when I feel like that. But when it happens at work what can I do? I work in a physical environment so it shouldn't be hard to work out that frustration but what to do when it doesn't work?. When I worked at a convenience store I just want to throw shit at people. One time I literally told a customer to fuck off and leave, as my coworker promptly told me I can't do that. I said I just did. She also told me to stay behind the counter, she was able to see that I wanted to throw some punches.
 It's not like at home where I can remove myself thow. At least at home I can walk out for a few or play games. What to do when I am at work?

b8ph8r,I thought this would be a good place to share my 4 months alcohol free experience,"So I would say my ptsd symptoms haven't bothered me in a year and a half, two years. Thanks to time, therapy and life experience and lessons. But mostly acceptance either came or helped me get through.
Anyways because of two very extreame events in which I lost control of my environment made me realize I would be making different choices when the unpredictable chaos happened which meant I could've not had that lost of control over my environment. At that moment I knew it was alcohols fault and that I needed to live a life without it.
Well 4 months later and I'm still suffering every day horribly. I'm thinking its PAWS (post acute withdrawal syndrome) but saw my psychiatrist today for meds for it and instead walked away with meds for my flashbacks. 
Not only has it been a hellish rollercoaster with alcohol withdrawal on my brain, but this might be all my ptsd coming back (I've noticed symptoms of it coming back for 9 days now). 
But it was intresting to learn a part of my experience is that I'm dealing with flashbacks sober, which means I'm applying whole new thoughts/judgements on the emotions as they come back up. 
It's been a lot of beating myself up, anxiety, social anxiety, feeling of everything is going to fall apart, confused thinking and fatigue. 24/7 for 4 months. 
My doctor said to keep going on as time will get me through and PAWS usually last from 6 months- 2 years in extreame cases.
So I'll keep fighting and marijuana helps a million, but so expensive cause need so much. 
But yep fighting and not drinking and any day of this hellish limbo is better than any day drinking. Sober living is so different and I swear to God so much easier than drinking life.

I can’t get therapy for it. I’ll get in trouble if I’m caught having insomnia or crying. I had two bad panic attacks last week while driving, which I have never experienced before. My friends do not care. Caffeine, boxing, weight lifting, and video games are the only things that help completely.

b8r5oj,Avoiding class after having a flashback there last week,"Hi everyone. Im a psychology major, hoping to help people who have been through trauma. Last week in one of my psych classes we began learning about paraphilia (which is basically harmful sexual deviation). I’m a CSA survivor. 

In order to help us empathize with people who suffer from a paraphilia, my professor showed a film that interviewed a rapist. In the beginning of class she warned us that it could be triggering and if anyone had a problem, we could leave and not worry about an absence or anything. 

EVERYTHING in me was screaming I won’t be able to handle this, I should get up and leave and spare myself the discomfort, but I didn’t want everyone to know I was the rape survivor in the class. I know I shouldn’t be embarrassed by it or anything, but no one else left and I didn’t want to out myself. 

Needless to say, I freaked out. I don’t actually remember leaving the class, I just know I was starting to auditory hallucinate and then I was sitting outside chain smoking and shaking like a leaf. I ended up grabbing my stuff and leaving once the film had ended, I waited outside for a full 40 minutes. 

Today would have been the first time back in that class since this happened, but I skipped. I’m too embarrassed. I feel like everyone knows, and I’m worried that when i was half in flashback mode I made an asshole out of myself somehow as I was leaving. I don’t even remember. 

I just need some support I guess. I know I need to go back to class, and I know I didn’t do anything wrong, I’m just so embarrassed and anxious about the whole thing.",throwawayofffmychest,2019-04-02 17:25:57,4,301,29.3,12.25,94.43,1,16.72,19.6,94.68,61.13,21.26,14.29,12.62,1.33,0,0.33,0,6.98,6.31,12.96,11.3,5.32,6.98,2.99,23.92,2.66,1.33,1.33,1.99,0.66,7.31,0.66,6.64,2.99,1,0.33,7.31,0,0,0.33,0,15.61,3.32,1,3.99,3.65,1.33,3.99,1.99,0.33,0.66,0.66,1.99,0.33,0.33,1,0.33,6.98,2.66,1.33,1.99,0.33,1.33,7.64,11.63,1,14.95,1.99,6.31,6.98,3.99,0.66,0,0,0,0,0.66,0.66,0,0,0,0,14.29,5.65,4.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.65,0.66,0
b8rg9t,"Multiple diagnoses, people don’t see PTSD is most important to me","I’ve been dealing with PTSD for at least 8 years now, but the things that gave me PTSD started 10 years before that. I’ve also been diagnosed with autism, ADHD, dysthymia and anxiety, and I feel like PTSD is the one diagnosis that is mostly overlooked by the people in my life. Maybe it’s because the events happened so long ago, and the nightmares and flashbacks have been so constant, it’s nothing new anymore, and people have moved on with their lives, while I feel like I’m still stuck. 

I have been seeing a trauma therapist and been getting EMDR for the past 1,5 years, although this is intertwined with therapy for my other diagnoses so the trauma isn’t always the most pressing matter. I booked some really progress when I started EMDR and my friends were supportive, but now I’ve been in therapy so long again and told people I had processed a lot of my trauma, it’s not really on the table anymore. 

Everyone cares more about my recent autism diagnosis (I self diagnosed myself as an adult and this was finally confirmed after a long process of testing) and my recurring depression. I feel like no one close to me realizes that PTSD is a really serious and “bad” thing, but I also don’t want to keep bringing up what happened all the time and saying it was bad. This is the one diagnosis I feel most alone in. I live alone, and have no partner, and I experience the moments my PTSD is worse alone as well. In my dreams, when I’m confused in the mornings, when I watch tv, when I get random flashbacks. 

I just don’t want to keep reminding people, but I don’t really know what I expect of or want from them either. Lately my nightmares have gotten worse again. I feel like I can handle my other diagnoses, but they might be more serious in people’s eyes because things like autism and ADHD can’t be “cured”. While to me those diagnoses are just part of who I am, and I can accept that.

b8syvm,Scared all the time; trying to save my relationships. (TW; Child abuse and suicide),"I have intense fears that manipulate most of my decisions. I want to learn to trust again, but I have a hard time believing that all my loved ones aren't going to inevitably hurt me. It affects my relationships pretty heavily. I tend to have a negative hindsight on everything and it stresses out my loved ones. What I see as a 'rant', they see as overwhelming and they get scared for my well being; especially since I often talk about not wanting to be alive and feel like nothing is worth living for.

Just the other day, my boyfriend of 2 years expressed that it stresses him out terribly and has debated leaving due to the amount of stress. He still loves me, is attracted to me, and still wants to be with me. But the stress is too much for him at times; especially since I tried to kill myself a year back.

I feel so awful knowing that all this time, he was going through so much pain when I was. I had a feeling that it had affected him, but I didn't know it was so severe that he would want to leave despite still being in love with me. I couldn't see how bad it was getting with me; even after trying to commit suicide.

My best friend told me that he has distanced himself due to feeling like I won't take anything nice or constructive he has to say in. We were really close, but he feels that the sadness is out of his and my control.

I really want to change my negative attitude. I really want to work on my communication skills so I can talk about my feelings in a healthier manner and not say scary things out of depression frustration. I really want to make my loved ones happy instead of scaring them. I really want to get better. I don't want to lose the people that I love the most.

To think that I've had this affect of them, it breaks my heart. I never wanted to be a dead weight. I wanted to make them happy because they make me happy. It really, truly breaks my heart that I hurt people like this.  
I want to learn to trust. Growing up with an emotionally and physically abusive mother, I struggle hard. I feel like everyone is out to get me or is inevitably going to hurt me or is going to be severely disappointed in me.

Examples; My friends have been making friends at work. I'm happy for them, but at the same time, I'm terrified that they'll like them better than me and forget about me. I see the way they laugh and how much closer they're already getting; already able to make the types of jokes that we make. I'm terrified that I'll be so much more insignificant to them and that they'll forget all about me or see me as less. More than anything, I'm scared that it'll break my heart beyond repair and I'll be stuck even more distraught than I am now. Its such a selfish fear and I hate myself for it, but I can't help it. I get defensive and cold and start to shut them out. I don't mean to, but I figure that if they're going to leave or hurt me, I should stop caring before it hurts really bad and makes me look like an idiot for loving anyone.

I'm scared my boyfriend is going to find a girl who is sweeter, funnier, prettier, and just over all more amazing than me. I'm terrified that he'll see that I'm just not worth it and he'll leave me for someone better. Someone easier who isn't struggling with PTSD. I'm scared that he'll give up on me or be disappointed in me.

I want to stop these toxic habits. The coldness, the snappiness, the intense venting, the negativity. No wonder why everyone feels so hopeless around me.

I see a therapist, try to exercise regularly, and take antidepressant medication. I feel like not much is working and now I feel as though I'm walking on a tight rope and if I make one more mistake, I'm going to lose everyone. I've been distancing myself from everyone so I can have time to think of what to do and how to better myself as a person.

b8xh29,How to trust people again?,"Hello all,


In my recovery journey, I feel I have hit an impasse. I know this is only temporary, but I am having a very difficult time figuring out how to overcome this hurdle. 

When I was ages 2-6, I was sexually abused by multiple caregivers and sexually assaulted by my father. I inferred, at a very young age, that anyone I became emotionally comfortable with would inevitably hurt me like my childhood abusers. And while this was helpful as a child (being mistrustful of adults allowed me to be a bit safer in my childhood situation), as an adult this is very difficult to live with.

As an adult, I find it nearly impossible to form attachments or emotional connections with anyone. I find myself unable to reach out to old friends and I find it too painful to create new friends. I find it painful to be around family members and uncomfortable to be around others in a therapy session, such as DBT or group therapy. Even therapy is difficult because I find I can't trust my therapist.

I can tolerate being around others for a short time, but overall I find myself so uncomfortable that I can't emotionally connect to anyone. Or, if the other tries to connect to me, I'll start having bad feelings from my childhood resurface (flashbacks?): I'll start feeling unsafe, I'll start feeling that they're going to take advantage of me, that they only want me for nefarious reasons, or I'll feel that I'm in danger. I'll keep feeling these uncomfortable emotions until I feel that I have to stops communicating with the person for my own safety, even if consciously I know I'm only experiencing PTSD symptoms. If I fight my symptoms, push through them, they become worse and overwhelming until I feel that I have to stop talking with them.

This is problematic though. According to most of the literature on PTSD, support systems are invaluable for recovery. IMO, it's one the of the key components towards recovery. But I don't know how to have a support system if I can't feel okay around others. I desperately need a support system. My childhood trauma has been resurfacing lately, more memories coming to the surface, more difficult symptoms I'm learning how to live with. But I find myself lonely, I want to feel connected to someone, but whenever I do it triggers flashbacks. I feel unsafe. I feel that I have to run away.

Can anyone relate? Or have any advice? I do not like the way I'm living, yet I don't know how to stop the PTSD symptoms from preventing me from having relationships or a support system. 

Any advice/stories/help/feedback/etc would be appreciated.

Thing is, I have the “flight or freeze” version of PTSD, and he has the “fight” version of PTSD. They often don’t play well together, but we both work very hard to be the other’s rock. We’re very open about expressing our triggers and communicating our needs.

That being said, what do you wish your wife or partner would do to be more supportive?

b904eu,How do you choose therapist based on availability and methods offered?,"I am suffering from depression and PTSD from the bullying I dealt with while younger. I have a high-deductible insurance plan and the deductible hasn't been close to being met. I looked up the therapists in my area and called all the ones that are close to me. Only a few ones called me back:

- One was only available on the weekends and charges $125-150/hr on a sliding rate. I think he said he could charge $125/hr for my case.

- Our phone call was only a few minutes, but he seemed to be the best fit based on his personality as he seemed more empathetic. He said he could do EMDR. But his office is a 25 minute drive from me (so I can't use my lunch break to see him and thus can probably only see him on the weekends) and charges $150/hr

- Another one seemed like he could be a good fit based on our free consultation over Skype, and charges $100/hr but I think he's younger than me and is only available on the weekends. He also mentioned he could try CBT and maybe mindfulness/meditation, but does not offer EMDR

- The last one seemed the most available but charges $150/hr. He had availability for sessions the same day I called and the day afterwards. But based on our free in-person consultation session, it seemed like he was doing most of the talking and rambled too much. He did say he could do EMDR, which I heard is the most effective therapy for those with PTSD. I don't see how CBT would be as effective as I've tried reframing my thoughts before and didn't find complete success with it

What do you guys think? Which one should I go with? I really want to get treatment ASAP and prefer not having to wait until the weekend to get treatment",thraway14,2019-04-03 09:24:34,0,331,41.76,57.2,39.06,42.2,20.69,15.11,89.73,55.59,15.71,13.29,6.34,0.91,0.6,5.44,0,2.42,6.34,11.48,10.88,4.53,8.76,1.81,21.45,5.44,4.53,1.51,3.32,2.72,2.11,1.51,0.6,0,0,0.6,12.39,0,0.3,0,5.74,16.31,5.14,3.63,2.72,3.32,0.6,3.93,2.72,1.21,1.51,0,1.81,0,1.51,0,0.3,4.83,1.51,1.51,1.21,1.51,0,6.34,10.57,0.3,12.08,0.91,6.04,5.14,3.32,1.51,0,0.91,0.3,0,0.3,0,0.3,0,0,0,14.2,3.63,1.51,0.3,0,0.91,0,2.11,0,1.81,0.6,3.32

This is something I’m working on. My trauma comes from reaching out for help and then the people who were supposed to help me causing the trauma. I think that’s part of why I am distancing myself from my feelings.

b96yp7,Can someone have PTSD if they are not experiencing Intrusive Memories Symptoms?,"Hello all. I am currently not able to get support from authorized medical people but I would love to hear others' experiences about this. It might help me understand my condition better. 


2 years ago I had 2 traumatic events (saftey related, I lived in a war zone and they were separated by around a month) and ever since they happened I am not the same anymore. It was gradual change towards the bottom. I never thought the trauma had anything to do with my symptoms and I always gave other reasons to them. Until when I was thinking about when did it all start and my memory led me back to that first traumatic event. 


My question is: Can I possibly have PTSD if I am not experiencing Intrusive Memories Symptoms? When I am having other symptoms like: 


Physical reactions to something that reminds me of the traumatic event. (fireworks, gun shots... etc). 


Negative thoughts about myself and the world.


Feeling detached from family and friends. 


Lack of interest in activities I once enjoyed. 


Difficulty feeling positive emotions. 


Always being on guard of danger (this too much) and being easily frightened. (I would go to the doctor because of a little amount of pain thinking I might die of it!)


Irritability and aggressive behavior.


I think I should also add that I have no problem talking about the events, I never avoided remembering them and I have nightmares but not about the specific traumatic events that I mentioned.

b9866j,I need advice about my therapist,"my insurance covers very little and financially I can only afford to do therapy with someone they cover. 



I (30 m) did a first session today with a therapist and I felt really uncomfortable. I just didnt really connect with the guy. 


when I first went in, he sort of opened his arms at me as if he wanted a hug. I didnt because I figured I was misreading his body language and sat down instead, brushing it off.


At one point, he reached over and put a hand on my knee. I guess that's a normal thing for people to do, but it made me uncomfortable. 



At the end of our session, he hugged me. I froze and then sort of patted him on the back. he was blocking the door. he said he likes to hug people ""male, female, whatever."" I didnt know what to say. he said I could tell him if I was uncomfortable. I just froze and mumbled something. 


I have a history of very serious sexual and other abuse. I'd mentioned that to him during the session. I dont really want to go back, but he said a bunch of times that he wants to help me and wants me to.

When I was in the thick of the events that have given me my PTSD like symptoms, they never sat me down and asked if I was ok. They never really checked up in me and I felt even more alone then normal, they seemed to go on as if what was happening to me didn’t exist. I love them but at the same time I felt like I was abandoned by them when I needed them most.

On the other hand, they support me in so many ways and work hard. They are loving parents and the genuinely care about me and my sibling and I know they maybe were trying their best but didn’t know how to handle the situation.

b98exi,Tonight my dad told me that I should get over my problems because people have had it worse than me,"Context: I was diagnosed kind of late with PTSD about two years ago, due to trauma I experienced related to my mom and her death when I was a teenager.

Tonight I was pretty sad and opened up to my dad about some of the things that I've been going through and thinking recently. He basically said that I need to get over it and not be so ""dramatic,"" and literally said that my grandparents went through so much worse because they were Holocaust survivors so my problems are nothing compared to what their problems were, so I need to just stop being so sad all of the time. 

I had no idea what to say... it's like he was insinuating that I was being disrespectful to my grandparents by having my own problems, or like I was trying to overshadow their problems? Even as I type it out I don't even know how I'm feeling. I'm not trying to say that my life is worse than anyone else's life, or whatever he is insinuating. I know people have it worse than I do. But using that argument, ""someone out there has it worse than you do,"" doesn't make anyone feel better. 

I don't even know what I'm trying to say. This interaction with my dad makes me feel like I can't tell anyone anything.

b9b6fq,How do I get passed it?,"So I recently had oral cancer. (History:physically and mentally abusive childhood, abandonment, bullied, depression, self harm). After my surgery, a hole appeared in the floor of my mouth. A surgeon came into my 6 bed bay at 2am and using local anaesthetic stitched up the floor of my mouth by a flashlight that her assistant was holding, she stabbed me through the lip (which wasn't numbed) a couple of times and the next day I found out she hadn't done it properly and still had a hole. The surgeon  wanted me to go under General and get it sorted but I was too scared and so let it heal naturally which took 3 weeks on NG tube which made me sick. I have bad veins also and was stabbed numerous times every day by people trying to find veins for canulars or to take bloods. 2 doctors gave me a nose bleed because they were trying to very forcefully shove a large NG tube that was the wrong size up my nose. My dietician  restricted my water and I had severe dehydration headaches all weekend while she was off and no one would up my water intake because her word is law or whatever. Anyway long story short, it was a lash up and lots of horrible things happened to me along with just trying to deal with getting cancer and going through treatment. So since then I have nightmares every night, I can't sleep, I grind my teeth all day getting angry at how (I've tried) but can't get any help for what happened to me and psychological help. So it didn't really click until I went for an eye test and they did the glaucoma air pressure test and I completely broke down. I was so embarrassed because the lady doing it clearly didn't get it, it's only a burst of air to the eye, it doesn't hurt. Which I get. But to me, it was another test, another thing being done to me in a kind of medical setting and I just couldn't handle it and lost my shit.

b9bm1t,"Love of my life yelling and screaming at me to ""get over it"" because my problems are fucking things up and he's sick of me being stuck in the past [NSFW]","Okay so let's get one thing out of the way. I absolutely, unconditionally, fervently love my common-law husband. He's the only person I've ever been able to trust and the only one I've ever loved.
We both have messed up pasts in that he has managed to choose women who use him, or are downright horrible excuses for human beings --his ex before the last was/is a narcissistic sociopath.

Myself, well, it's a long and complicated story. Let's just say it's been very unstable from my very birth. I've been harassed, bullied, beaten, slandered... there have been attacks both physical and mental, assault, sexual assault, aggravated assault. All through my life, starting at childhood.
I never spoke of it. It's true what they say... you can't just bottle it all up. It's like filling up a dog bowl with a garden hose; at some point it's gonna overflow.
Once that happens it's gonna be a mess.
I kept it all in too long, and although I have *talked* about it, it hasn't been properly processed and now it's weighing me down.

My PTSD and related anxiety took a turn for the worse a few weeks ago. I started feeling scared, nonstop, and constantly looking over my shoulder. For what, I don't know.
Then it got to the point where I am now. I'm scared shitless 24/7 for no apparent reason. Every sudden move or loud noise makes me jump. All the time I feel like my chest is being crushed and my throat squeezed. Food is like ash in my mouth; it sticks everywhere and I just choke on it and vomit. I haven't been able to eat in two weeks. I can drink only a small mouthful once in a while, or I'll throw up. It's like my body considers food and drink to be poison. I shake, I'm drenched in a cold sweat and find myself scratching myself all the time. I tend to hyperventilate and cry a lot.  I've never been agoraphopic or anything, but now I can't bring myself to go outside. I can barely leave the bed --being wrapped up in a blanket seems the best place to be.

SO has been very sweet and supportive, until one night... He came up to the bedroom and started yelling at me how lazy I am and how HE can't do anything because of my ""constant problems""... 
I began to cry right away, and this aggravated him even further. For some reason he can't handle me crying.
He told me to ""get over it already, you're a fucking grown-up"" and how I'm ""always being sick or having problems "" and pretty much blaming everything that's wrong with the world on me.
I tried to defend myself saying ""I'm not like this on purpose or something"", to no avail.
Ultimately he huffs and leaves me to bawl my eyes out. You know the kind of uncontrollable crying that actually hurts your innards and makes you feel almost desperate? That's what it was.
I had some 10mg diazepams for my anxiety, and I started taking them one after another.
I'd taken around 10 when I realized what I was doing, went to the toilet and threw up.
I called the crisis unit, they told me to come in the morning.

The next morning SO was his usual self, like nothing ever happened. He drove me to the crisis unit and I've been here for 4 days now. He's visited twice.
First time, no problem at all. Yesterday... I was having a terrible day. I had slept for around 1,5 hours, having nightmares the whole time, I was feeling queasy and weak and generally like shit. Tried hard not to cry. SO wanted my opinion on something in his usual cryptic way (he may say something like, ""I saw a pretty nice car today"" and you're supposed to know which car he meant and offer your opinion on it) and my brain just didn't work. He went ballistic again, giving me the same shit treatment as before.
""You NEVER have anything to say!!!""

Eventually I started bawling again, then hyperventilating and my heart felt like it's going to implode (I actually have a heart condition). SO grunted something like ""I'm not going to waste my time here, getting my nerves shredded to pieces"" and stormed off. I was sure he'd dumped me there and then.
He did at least ask a nurse come see me.
He didn't call, didn't text. I texted him last night, groggy from all the sedatives, saying I'm sorry that I can't be the person he wants me to be.
He replied that he loves me, but I don't know. His behavior confuses me.  
One minute he's the sweetest, most caring man known to humankind, and the next he's the wrath of hell itself.
I'm on the autism spectrum and I have enough trouble understanding people as it is. With my trust issues it's even harder.
Am I too much for him? If so, then what's the point. I don't want to be a burden to anyone or cause anyone any pain.

I was a complete mess.

I have a smear test today and thought I was fine but I keep having flashbacks of the surgery and getting really worked up about having it and how I'm going to explain why I'm so worked up when. I go for it.

b9dx5u,8 months of EMDR,"So I've been doing EMDR for 8 months now. It's made a huge difference. Up until a few days ago, I had gone 8 days with no depression or panic attacks. That is huge for me! But a few days ago, I finally came to terms with what caused the PTSD and potentially other things, my angry Father and my controlling Mother. When I finally accepted that they were the root cause of my PTSD, my former drug and alcohol addictions, and my stunted emotional/mental growth as a man, rather than feeling relieved that it wasn't my fault I felt worse. I feel robbed of my life. I feel heart broken that 30 years of hardships and depression and constant anxiety were caused by my parents who did a terrible job raising me and showing me love. I feel like my entire life is a lie. And I don't know how to move passed all of this.   
I'm also a masturbation addict. The therapy has stopped my addiction to pornography but not masturbation. Lately, I've had this cold dead feeling come over the lower half of my body. I'm not sure what this feeling is exactly. It makes me feel scared and contaminated. When it happens, sometimes I feel instantly turned on like my libido is turned up to 11.

Sometimes I can’t recall it fully, cause I was 8 and nobody knows but I wonder if that’s why I do this, so that I can know that it was real in some twisted recreation, or this time it’s not on anything or one but me so I can feel like I deserve it and move on. This is speculation, I realized it’s pretty fucked but does anyone else struggle w like a sexual stalk-homes syndrome too   ?

b9f4pq,Suppressing panic attacks in front of my boyfriend,"I've been diagnosed with PTSD from a previous abusive relationship and frequently experience panic attacks (which I'm working on in therapy 🙂).
My boyfriend is a major source of support for me, he's amazing and he would never ever even think about hurting me. However, my past involves a lot of sexual abuse and sometimes I panic during sex, or even if we message about sexual stuff (I haven't told him I panic about that because I feel ridiculous, why would my brain perceive talking about sex with the love of my life as something dangerous!? I hate my brain so much)
I'm staying with him soon and I know it's so silly but I'm getting anxiety because I'm really worried about panicking when we're getting into it... Especially if I have a flashback and perceive him as a threat. Last time this happened I couldn't get the picture of the pain in his eyes out of my head for days, it really hurt him, and now I'm terrified of this happening again because not only does it ruin the moment, but I can see it hurts him, and he is the last person in the world I would ever want to hurt 😥

I always think about what happen to me or could have happen to me. always as in  everyday. I barely sleep in fear of being murdered by my family while I sleep. but when I do sleep theyre away from the house. my school counselor wanted to put me through a PTSD test or something. but I wasn't at that school long enough to obtain it. I barely socialize with people , because I feel like if I get close to them I could end up being murdered like those people on the news. I've had a hard life so far dealing with everything mentally and emotionally. I can't maintain friendships or relationships. i have a mental breakdown everyday. I'm constantly suicidal. I get 'triggered' when my family  tries to harm me , that I become stiff as in not defending my self while I get punched by my dad. I'm 19 now and i've thought of the incident where my mom tried to smother me with a pillow everyday for 9-10 years. I know this isn't a doctor's office but I feel like someone with PTSD or someone with expierence with it can help me better understand what's happening to me. thank you.

b9krus,"crosspost from r/relationship advice, is my mental illness the real problem here?","didn’t realize this would be so long, i apologize in advance, and if you read all the way through thank you so much!


I recently turned 25, I have ptsd. I’ve been told i’m quite mature for my age and i attribute it to life experience, albeit most of it negative. I’m relatively inexperienced in relationships, and growing up in an abusive home made me really confused about love. I’ve been in 2 relationships prior to this one, both short, one with someone who was a cheater and i never really connected to in the first place, the other with someone i connected to deeply but he was emotionally unavailable and honestly not very nice to me or considerate.

Then I met M. M is sweet and caring. we first met to go to a concert (we like the same sort of obscure  music) and the second time we met we went bar hopping, ended up at a place with live music, danced and had our first kiss. It felt perfect, like everything falling in love was supposed to feel like. 

I started getting second thoughts a few months in, and was also severely depressed because it was the holiday season which always brings up bad memories. I got really drunk and broke up with him over the phone because i felt like i wasn’t being fair to him, like i had nothing to offer, and no room outside of being sad to make someone else happy. that same day, while i was so depressed and black out drunk by this point i couldn’t walk, my male roommate raped me. i didn’t even know it had happened until he told someone later. we worked together in addition to living together and he told a coworker who told me. 

As you can imagine, i lost my shit. the first person i called when i found out was my dad (who has been abusive in the past but in that moment of weakness i reached out, he was surprisingly kind and supportive), the second person i called was M. he came over immediately, talked to me while i cried in his car, and waited outside while i kicked my roommate/rapist out. he came over every day and brought me food for a week, he texted me regularly to see how i was doing, asked me questions that at first i thought were patronizing, but later realized were him showing he cares; questions like “have you eaten?” “did you get enough rest” etc

since then we’ve gotten back together. it is the first time in my life (with the exception of my best friend) that i’ve felt truly loved and appreciated. but i wonder if i can ever truly return that to someone? am i too damaged? i try to show my love for him by cooking for him and telling him how wonderful he is, by buying small gifts. but i don’t know.

there have been a few hiccups, a few bumps in the road. My therapist told me to consider it a red flag, but i am inclined to disagree.

Most recently, while very drunk (he doesn’t handle his liquor well, in a sloppy way not a mean one) he asked something along the lines of am i trying to trap him with a pregnancy (I’ve been very open about the fact i don’t want kids) then when i (justifiably?) was like wtf dude he started crying, left my house, and TRIED TO DRIVE. i had to run my naked ass out to his car wrapped in a blanket to be like you can’t drive and lets talk about this, he just cried and apologized and admitted it was something his mom warned him about recently. i was a bit annoyed (maybe if you don’t want to get me pregnant stop cumming inside me? he knows i’m on birth control but like if it was a legitimate concern...). either way he apologized repeatedly and the next day came over and gave me a card where he had written all the reasons he loves me and wants to be with me, how much he doesn’t want to lose me (more on the card later)

another incident my therapist mentioned was when i was applying for a new job within the same company he offered to help with my cover letter and resume, he edited and sent it back to me and i thought his version was significantly worse. i felt like such a bitch i had to send both versions to multiple friends to verify that my version was actually better. but i still appreciate the effort so much.

a more humorous one, i was caramelizing onions for a meal i was making for him and he kept asking when i add the caramel. after showing him multiple recipes, he still doesn’t believe me that caramel isn’t involved.

long story short, i think he’s a little immature, and at 23 that’s expected. i feel like my therapist tried to imply that this is bad for me but i can’t really believe her. he is so good to me.

he frequently checks on my well-being. i’ve literally cried on his shoulder multiple times. he held me on the couch for 5 hours and comforted me the day after i found out about being raped when i was too upset to even speak. the day after the pregnancy trap thing i was so hungover (have literally never experienced anything like it think it was a combo of sleep deprivation and too much vodka) and he held me and when i said i might need to throw up he offered to hold my hair for me (it was already in a ponytail and i declined but still), the card he gave me where he said how much he loved me had $300 in it to help me pay my rent after my rapist roommate fled and left me with the full rent.

i feel like these are all things that prove he’s a good healthy person in my life, that his relative immaturity isn’t a barrier. but at the same time i wonder, is he so immature that he won’t realize he gives me more than i can give him right now? will i ultimately just hurt him? i just want to do the right thing. i want to be with the man i love, but i don’t want to feel like i’m using him. 

i really want an outsiders opinion, i need advice. if i’m only going to hurt him with my mental illness bull shit i want to know now. i don’t want to drag it out. but also, if i’m not going to inevitably ruin things because of my mental health, how can i show him how much he means to me, and how much i care, without spending a lot of money which i don’t have right now. if i could i’d buy him everything he’s ever wanted i would. he’s too good for me and too good for the world. at the end of the day all i want him to know is how wonderful he is.",brattynattylite,2019-04-04 17:52:11,0,1212,27.77,39.58,78.95,29.92,21.64,13.94,94.97,60.31,22.11,17.66,11.14,0.66,0.58,5.28,0,4.46,5.12,13.2,9.16,6.27,7.76,2.23,19.64,4.46,3.14,1.73,1.49,2.48,6.19,3.22,2.97,0.17,0.91,1.16,13.61,0.41,0.5,0.17,5.45,13.45,3.3,1.73,2.23,2.72,1.57,3.71,2.48,0.58,0.58,0.83,3.8,0.5,1.32,0.74,0.91,7.18,2.81,1.49,1.57,1.16,0.74,8.83,9.82,0.83,15.18,1.98,6.85,6.44,0.83,0.99,0.74,0.58,0,0,0.74,0.41,0.17,0,0.17,0,14.19,4.13,3.96,0,0.08,0.66,0.08,0.08,0.33,2.97,1.65,0.25
b9l4wc,Please help me help my husband. *TRIGGER WARNING *,"I think my husband has PTSD induced psychosis. 

My husband has PTSD. It all started in 2011, when he watched his buddy (more like a son to him) get murdered in a drive by. His buddy was shot 20+ times, mostly in his face. The bullets barely missed my husband. He still suffers from survivor's guilt.  We have been together for 6 years. Before we married, I educated myself on PTSD, and how to work together to help him with his ""otherside"". He's had a handful of minor setbacks over the years, but I am so proud of his progress! He went from self medicating with pain pills and alcohol, to occasionally using cbd products, to calm his mind. 

The downfall- last summer, we came up on a terrible car accident, where the car was crushed, out of control grass fire, and the woman had passed away. He ran over and pulled her out of the car, and carried her body to safety. He's been mentally declining ever since. 

His paranoia is at an all time high, negative thoughts have come back, and he claims he's seen her ghost. In January, his ""otherside"" had convinced him that I was against him, planning to leave him, get him committed. I became his enemy. It broke my heart, but I went above and beyond to reassure him that I am in this for the long haul, and that our wedding vows are a promise I would never break, no matter what his ""otherside"" thinks. 

Lately, hes been deep in delusional thoughts, sees dark and evil spirits, vivid hallucinations, doubts, mistrust, extremely selfish behavior, etc. He doesn't trust therapists. He has pushed away everyone that loves and cares for him, including me. It's such a devastating situation and feeling. I'm starting to feel like I'm in a losing battle with his ""otherside"". I feel like I've exhausted all of my options and ideas. I feel helpless. 

I'm begging for any advice!

b9lzvs,Need advice on dating a girl with ptsd,"Crossposting here from r/mentalhealth

Without getting too into her past experiences, she was emotionally abused and made to do sexual favors, and then stalked by the human garbage. This happened about 4-5 years ago and she sill has trust issues and emotional issues because of it. I am new to relationships, I've only had one long term relationship before this for two years and it ended abruptly and suddenly. Because of that I also am insecure with relationships and I was not sure if she actually liked me for a while. She does but she has a hard time showing it, and I've accepted that because I really like her. She has a hard time expressing herself to me which is fine but a little frustrating because I don't have much of a filter and I say what I feel to her.

She refuses to get help. She won't see a therapist and she won't take medication because she doesn't want to depend on it her whole life. She saw a therapist initially but it made the anxiety and depression worse leading to a suicide attempt, so she won't try again. I keep telling her she needs to talk to someone if not me, or try meds but she won't budge. 

Also, occasionally she will get very defensive with me about seemingly very random things, which does tend to lead to fights because it makes me upset and then she gets upset because of that. What should I do when this happens? She also never apologizes for doing it, which is also a little frustrating because it makes me feel bad, like I did something to upset her(enter, insecurity). 

 All of this being said, I have a few questions.

How do I help her get help? What can I do?

Will she ever open up to me? I see glimpses of her true self every now and then but I want to know everything about her, and it's frustrating that I can't.

If anyone would like to share experiences of dating someone with ptsd I'd love to hear them. Or if you suffer from ptsd I'd love to hear firsthand about these questions or the troubles we are having. I really want to make this work and I do really like her. Besides all of this, she really Is my dream girl and I find her incredibly attractive.

b9mvd0,PROGRESSSSS!!!! (yoga),"Sooooooo when I did yoga at the beginning of my PTSD recovery it was ehhhhhh. I was always too anxious to concentrate on the poses and I was worried about what other people thought of me. Just 5 months later I tried it again and it felt amazing.  I felt like a kid again (I used to do yoga in P.E. growing up) and I was so content with myself. The poses I struggled with previously were SO MUCH EASIER. It's so nice to see real progress!!! Yoga is so relaxing and I'd highly recommend it to expedite your recovery. One thing to note is for some people whose trauma is still fresh, it may feel like you're ""digging into a gushing wound"". Be careful and consult a therapist/counselor before trying mindfulness practices. Sometimes things aren't ready to be opened up yet and that's okay.  If you want to try yoga on your own, there are trauma based yoga videos on youtube. I can link it if anyone's interested. Just be careful and never rush your recovery.

b9nxke,"S**ual repulsion, but also sometimes not? TW","TW

       I've gone through kinda intense sexual trauma, and never ended up metabolising it because I've always refused to talk about it, which I guess is a me problem. I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar to the following.
       When I'm around people, it doesn't matter where or how many people, I am completely sex and touch repulsed. I hate thinking about it, if anyone touches me without asking I flip my shit, and I don't even let my family touch me. When I get intrusive thoughts about sex I have to leave the room some times. 
        However there are certain times, only when I am completely alone, where completely shift from that and resort to touching myself, fantasising etc. After I'm done with those episodes, I feel super gross and awful about myself. I have to curl up and try not to think about it, and when it comes up in my head later, I cringe even worse than I normally do.
        I just don't understand, Its like I will become two completely different people and it really gets to me a lot obviously.

I was posting on another sub and someone got quite aggressive. They then sent two pretty angry private messages to me. They hit pretty hard on my PTSD triggers.

So currently reeling from that. I have a strong desire to hide under a rock and never post on reddit again. 

But I love reddit. I love the people I have met and I have been so inspired by the different posts I have seen. It brings me to tears to know that some of my posts have inspired and helped some other people. I have been finding it actually helpful for my PTSD posting on reddit and I don’t want to stop.

b9rk08,Nightmares and screaming awake.,"I am seeing health care professionals for PTSD and Bipolar I disorder. I have previously had a suicide attempt in early '17 which led to me ""blacking out"" for 4 days (still have no idea how I woke up in a hospital). Prior to the attempt, my stress and depression were high. I started using marijuana to help me cope, after the attempt. It helped for a short while, but I ended up using too much &amp; too often, and got another manic episode-&gt;psych hospital.


 After the mania was treated, I was instructed to stay away from weed. Now, however, I will have nightmares which result in me screaming my s.o. awake, at night. Usually there will be an antagonizing force in my dream. This antagonist usually causes a sound or vibration that feels real, &amp; scares me awake. I have guessed in the past that the sound may be a memory of when I was blacked out. This is because I have heard that semi-conscious people may still hear/remember sounds. 


I also get nightmares about death/dying quite often. These nightmares do not scare me awake so much, as the antagonizing ones do. 


Any thoughts on this matter?

b9u488,Tuesday is a trauma anniversary and I found out that the person who sexually abused me has a parole hearing next month and might get out of jail,I'm already having a hard time just because of the anniversary. And I got an email Wednesday letting me know about the parole hearing. I didn't even know he was eligible for that yet. I might write a victim impact statement but I don't know if I can.

And the I shame myself for not having any hobbies or real interests anymore: 

How the fuck could I? I’m not bored enough. I’m busy literally fighting inner battles, all the time.

b9xtb5,I’m freaking out and I don’t have anyone to talk to. I don’t think calling a rape hotline would be appropriate for this. Possible trigger warning for trans abuse.,"I have ptsd from sexual assault, my father has ptsd from combat. He doesn’t know why I have ptsd, just that I do. He’s offered his shoulder which I’ve rarely taken him up on because I’m afraid he secretly holds crappy views on the ways that I was assaulted seeing as many people do. 


Anyways, I was just on the phone with him and he was going off about his wife’s daughter’s legal issues stemming from her “husband thinking he’s a man one day and a woman the next” so she “took matters into her own hands” and he said that Oregon Measure 11 got her like it got him (basically it’s a measure that was passed in 1994 that treats violent first time offenses strictly with sentencing). He was saying some serious transphobic things and also saying he hopes the offender can “get through this” and that “she’ll be okay”. He called the victim a “bottom dweller”.


I’m panicking, not because I’m trans, but just because that poor woman had something terrible happen to her for trying to be herself and my father is just being the piece of shit that he was pre prison. It’s like I’m panicking on her behalf. I’ve never met these people. I probably never will. I just am freaking out and I feel like I don’t have any right to, but at the same time I know it’s my brain recognizing that there’s potential danger (even though I’m not physically near my father) and is going into hyperdrive.

b9xwe0,looking for other members of this community who deal with trauma related to pelvic medical procedures,"Hi reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm scared to post this but am reaching out in case there are others in the community who hold this kind of trauma and are looking for ways to deal with it.

I believe there's an issue that is not spoken about enough whatsoever in the medical community that has haunted my life and the lives of many others - VCUG-related PTSD and trauma in children. VCUG stands for voiding urethrocystogram, and I'm a victim of its side effects. A few deeper Google searches on the topic led me to clarity about my own situation and led me to the stories of others. In a world where we are waking up to the rampant sexual abuse at the hands of those in power, this is a widely practiced and accepted procedure done in children that leaves many, especially girls, with symptoms mirroring those of violent rape. I am one of them. I'm just now starting to learn about it and what happened to me, but I can't believe this continues to happen in the medical community. Moreover i feel like these complaints arent heard because they're often performed on children who can't advocate for themselves, and it's considered ""standard"" and ""necessary"".   


I'd file a lawsuit for my specific situation (bringing students into the room without consent, overall damages and PTSD from the procedure) but my statute of limitations ended long ago. I still think there's a story to be told. Would anyone be willing to share their stories about going through experiences like this?",ConsciousDentist,2019-04-05 15:59:47,4,273,75.35,45.62,79.79,1.1,24.82,23.81,86.81,55.68,16.48,7.33,5.86,0.37,0,0,1.1,9.16,6.23,18.32,7.69,4.76,5.13,1.83,15.02,2.93,1.1,1.83,0.37,1.1,5.13,0.73,4.03,0.37,1.1,0,10.62,0,0,0.37,0,12.09,3.66,1.47,0.37,1.47,1.1,4.4,2.93,1.1,0.73,0.73,3.66,0.73,2.2,0.73,0,6.96,2.93,0.73,2.93,0.37,0,4.03,11.36,0.37,12.45,1.83,7.69,2.56,1.83,0.37,0.37,0,0,0,0.37,0,0.37,0,0,0,15.02,3.66,2.93,0,0.73,0.37,0,0.73,1.47,3.66,0.73,0.73

b9zazl,Weed for PTSD?,"I have PTSD that feels like it's only getting worse and the only person that's taking it seriously is my boyfriend. My family and therapist are either dismissive or not taking the problems as serious as they are. 
I have tried anti-depressants but they either don't work or make me feel worse, I have tried essential oils (Mums suggestion), I have tried anxiety medications like Valium but I'm not in control of when I have it (medications like that are under control of my mum - locked box).
I have even tried getting my hands on CBD oil since everything I read seemed like it would be beneficial but I live in Australia and from what I've been told it's so hard to be prescribed that someone in my situation is unlikely to ever get it. 

So that brings me to Marijuana. I have an addictive personality but not with everything, for example, I used to smoke cigarettes and never got addicted but I have to be careful with alcohol. PTSD is one among many of my mental illnesses and I've read that weed can be a depressant, can cause psychosis and other negative symptoms. However I've also read that it can be good for PTSD, my flashbacks and episodes are frequent and intense at the moment and I'm lost as to what to do. I don't want to rely on weed, I just need some help and a break from these constant breakdowns.

Is weed a good reliever for PTSD or are the negative symptoms too much of a risk? 
If you smoke weed for PTSD or something else, how much do you smoke and what strain and how does it help you?
If you don't think weed is the answer do you know of anything I haven't tried that could help me?

b9zryz,Should I be worried?,"Today I had a ptsd episode. At least that’s what I think it was. 

I’ve been doing really well, but today I just felt awful. I think one of my triggers is staying inside too much, as I didn’t have a choice whether or not I could leave the house when I was younger. I didn’t have anything to do and spent the whole day inside. I started dissociating, hyperventilating, and tearing up a little bit. I felt dizzy, like I wanted to throw up, and disoriented. I felt like I was standing just a few paces behind or beside myself... watching this strange person unfold. I couldn’t control myself, my shallow breaths, lack of energy, fear and a hazy disconnect from reality. 

I have a very caring significant other who loves me very much. He is there for me through everything, and always says he worries for my safety. I am so, so thankful to have him in my life, but I’m afraid I scare him and burden him. I’m wondering if I should be concerned about my behavior. He left me today, wet-eyed, breathing heavily, and closing my eyes, to go to work. He looked concerned. 

I still felt awful once he left, so I decided to drink the remainder of the beer in the fridge to soothe myself. I feel happy now. 

Should I be worried about these episodes? As I said I’ve been doing well lately, but don’t want to terrify those around me. What can I do about this?

ba00v2,Diagnosed with high functioning PTSD at 16 years old. (TW: r*pe),"Long story short, about 6 months ago I was sexually assaulted and abused repeatedly by my ex-boyfriend who - ending up cheating on me anyways.


About 3 weeks ago I came out to my school about what happened. I didn’t name him. 
They then proceeded to call my parents, and I told them. They didn’t believe me and simply revictimized me.

I made another post about that story. It’s quite a lot.

I then began seeing a therapist at a shelter. She’s designated for sexual assault victims and I was terribly nervous and exhausted with everything when I had first met her.

During my first actual session, she diagnosed me with PTSD. My second session consisted of taking a survey from the DSM. I answered high on every question except one: “Feeling anger towards others.”

I get horrible nightmares. My anxiety is through the roof. Even before my ex hurt me, my parents royally fucked me up with their abuse.

For the past week I’ve been having episodes every day. During school I go to my AP psych teacher’s prep period, and I sit in his room and cry.

I just have to exhaust myself I guess; to stop the thinking, the images of him. Just seeing him in school makes me panic. I also can’t do that much anymore with the school unless they involve the police and my parents.

My parents would beat my ass, and make my life hell until I was 18.

ba0qmp,PTSD Dreams,"Wanted to ask y’all about something I’ve been struggling with lately.

After my big move across the country and finishing my undergrad back in December, I’ve been more or less putting therapy and progress on hold. In a way it almost feels like I’ve “paused” my progress, and that my PTSD symptoms have stalled for the most part. However, due to how much free time I have here I’m finding myself fixated on whether or not I even have PTSD anymore (I know that I do, I just feel like I’m not “sick” enough - this is an issue for another post). This is carrying over into my dreams, and for about a week or so I’ve been having incredibly intense and vivid dreams involving PTSD symptoms specifically - triggers leading into full-blown panic attacks, nightmares inside of nightmares, flashbacks within my dreams, etc.

Do any of y’all ever deal with anything like this? I’ve been going through my days pretty confused at times about whether or not these upsetting things are happening to me irl, and I feel a bit nuts.

ba22a3,Dismissive family (TW - NSFW),"Trigger warning for mention of multiple sexual abuse experiences and other 

So kind of a long summary of my life:
At age 6 I was molested which resulted in moving houses followed quickly by the seperation of my parents, my dad was unstable for a few years until he found a new family and I was thrown in. 

This family was abusive, mostly emotionally and verbally. My dad was a very angry man, very manipulative and ignored how the others treated me. He went through a breakdown, threatened to set a house on fire with children inside and after numerous other outbursts he was admitted into a kind of mental health ward. When he got out I was thrown right back into seeing this family again despite trying to refuse. I started self harming when I was 10 (which I still struggle with trying to quit, 8 years later).
During my time there my stepsister molested me when I was 11. In those years I was also molested repeatedly by a girl in school although I don't have the specific timeline for those incidents. 

Skip forward a few years I started to experience visual and auditory hallucinations (I'm told are either a result of trauma or OCD). I have had one suicide attempt in my first year of highschool, later that same year I was raped by two men I didn't know.

I also suffer from multiple eating disorders, I have BPD and in recent years been in several toxic relationships that I struggle to look back on. A lot of my past decisions have gotten me into some very dangerous situations that I'm surprised I'm even alive today. 

My family knows this, I have a large family but am only close with a handful and majority of these select few know almost everything that's happened in my life since they love to gossip. I currently am not in school nor do I have a job, I can't drive and I struggle with anxiety, maybe even agoraphobia. However I am about to try to get my learners and in a few months I'm entering a school for people in my situation. 

I'm in a pretty bad place at the moment, trying to get my hands on something to ease the pain. I'm looking into different medications, cbd oil but complications arise. The only thing I have for me right now is some Valium but my mum keeps it locked in a box and gives it to me when she decides I need it, not when I say I need it. 

My family mocks me and belittles me for struggling to be independant for things like taking a bus or getting a job or even making an appointment for myself. They dismiss my flashbacks and panic attacks and night terrors. I've asked multiple times to be taken to a psych ward during breakdowns but my mum thinks I'm just exagerating. When I'm having a meltdown in the middle of the night she tells me to just ""go to sleep"". She belittled my problems in front of the doctor while I was trying to get medication for anxiety so I was prescribed a small amount. Only 6 pills. 

It's like I have to completely lose my mind and show it physically for my issues to be taken seriously otherwise they just get dismissed or compared to something others can handle. I don't know how to get them to listen and take me seriously when I express suicidal thoughts or self destructive impulses let alone ptsd breakdowns. It's like they completely forgot everything I've been through and treat me like someone who is just attention seeking even though they've had it easy. I don't understand how they can know the abuse I've been through and still deny my struggles.",aussianon,2019-04-06 00:46:03,2,638,39.25,18.58,94.72,1,22,18.34,92.01,57.37,18.97,13.95,11.76,0,0,1.1,1.1,5.02,5.33,13.95,9.25,7.05,7.52,1.25,18.18,4.08,2.04,2.04,1.25,2.19,6.43,0.94,5.49,1.57,1.41,0.47,7.99,1.88,0,0.94,1.25,11.76,2.35,1.57,0.47,3.45,0.78,3.92,2.19,0.63,0.31,0.63,3.29,0.31,2.19,0.31,0.47,7.99,1.72,1.25,2.51,1.88,0.94,5.96,10.82,0,14.26,1.57,5.96,7.52,1.57,1.25,1.41,0,0,0.47,0.16,0,0.16,0,0,0,11.13,4.39,2.04,0.16,0,0,0,0.16,0.31,3.13,0.94,0

I was working through PTSD and as a coping mechanism started to have episodes of depersonalization on a frequent basis. I managed to go through the next several years this way until my PTSD came back worse than ever and I withdrew and lost contact with a lot of people.
Upon hearing that this friend died, I'm crushed. I knew them for years. We spend a good amount of time together...and yet I can only remember about 50% of it. My brain was trying to forget things to protect itself I suppose but as a result I've forgotten more than I realized. I'm so angry. I want to reminisce but everything is so foggy. I'm heartbroken that they're gone and I have so little to remember them by. I'm scared I'll never remember anything again.

ba512x,Trauma Recovery Coach app,"While looking for extra help besides therapy and medication while dealing with problems associated with daily living and PTSD I came across an app for veterans called Trauma Recovery Coach.  You don’t need to be a be a veteran to find it helpful. It’s simple but effective for me. It gives you a place to break down problems and places to type out solutions. It suggests helpful activities. When searching for extra help after the PTSD diagnosis I have found the most helpful information on veterans websites. I am grateful these resources exist for me to read even though I am not a veteran, I am a survivor of domestic violence with a brain injury. I am very much struggling making it through every day at this point. Brain injury plus trauma plus ptsd can sometimes result in poor decision making, so before making decisions or planning my day or week, I go through the options on the app and have found that I am becoming a little bit more productive and calm. I hope this helps someone else. I read everything that people post on here but rarely reply because I don’t know enough about PTSD recovery yet to be helpful and the last thing I would want to do would be to harm anyone going through this with bad advice. I wasn’t diagnosed with PTSD until February 25th, two months after the attack and brain injury. I knew something was very wrong but i couldn’t figure out the steps to take to start the process of fixing things until I understood that the problem was PTSD, not just post concussion syndrome.

ba6ka9,Does anyone here have a service dog for their PTSD?,"I just learned that you can get a service dog to help with PTSD. Do any of you have a service dog? Do they help you with your symptoms and quality of life? Does having a service dog “other” you in public, as it is visible evidence of your PTSD?

I was thinking earlier that I’d love to have a dog, and to be able to take him anywhere, and I learned that they can help with reminding you to take care of yourself, interrupting flashbacks and nightmares, and interrupting dissociative episodes. This sounds incredible to me, as I very often don’t eat until 5pm, sometimes 10pm, and suffer from all of those aforementioned symptoms. I might post this question to r/servicedogs too.

ba8oea,Much better day after terrible week,"I had a terrible meltdown last week after re experiencing some trauma ten years after it happened, after an event in my work community was similar to my own past personal trauma. I felt for three days like I could not get out of it.

Then yesterday, a massage by a massage therapist with training in ptsd and trauma, plus talking with a small intimate group of friends really helped. And today was sunny and warm and I feel whole again.

Just a reminder to myself that a flashback is hard but when it’s over, it’s over. A dozen years of therapy has not prevented all flashbacks but it has meant that they are rarer and in between them, I’m happy and whole. Thank you therapy. Thank you, to myself.

baaeb6,Maybe you guys can shed some light?,"I’m seeing a psychiatrist for nearly a year, I have pretty bad depression and anxiety, I feel like I have many of symptoms of Bipolar but docs haven’t seen me manic so are hesitant to diagnose. I know little about PTSD so please forgive me if I say anything annoying. but 9 years ago I got seriously ill, ventilated etc. I was convinced I was going to die but I was so ill I didn’t care. When they took me off the ventilator and woke me up I was .....different. I was Angry I discharged myself from hospital only to readmitted a day later. The following months I convalesced, I only worked half days. I became either flippant and a joker or if stressed I would literally lose my shit with people, literally shaking with temper when it’s unnecessary. Nowadays I’m out of work cause I can’t- I don’t trust myself to be with other people cause if I get upset I flip and become very emotional. I’ve done tons of drugs over the years more often than not to quieten my mind and I’ve engaged in seriously dangerous, promiscuous behaviour. I don’t have flashbacks about being ill but I do think of it often enough. I really am lost these days, almost afraid to interact in case I get annoyed and threatening.

baao4u,Too many triggers in the past 48 hours. I just need someone to tell me I’m okay. What helps you slow down?,"Hi everyone, I haven’t been here in awhile but recent events have left me very on edge and stressed with triggers coming back up and I really need to vent. 

I won’t go into detail as it could be triggering for others but there is a chance my mom’s stalker from over 20 years ago has found her and I’m terrified. If anyone really wants to know the full story there is a post on my profile from a couple days ago, but tw: assault, r*pe, stalking - I wouldn’t advise reading it, those are not even my triggers and it’s still terrifying to talk about. All of the comments on my post are stressing that me and my family are in immediate danger and that I need to call the police, get a gun, that I’m not safe, etc. It’s scared the shit out of me and I regret even posting it. I’m well-aware of how scary the situation is. Now I just need comfort. 

I live with my mom and my brother, her boyfriend (who is basically a stepdad to me) stays with us on the weekends. I’ve been on edge all week, deadbolting the doors and sleeping with a baseball bat by my bed because I’m scared shitless. 

I was breathing a little bit of a sigh of relief with my stepdad staying with us for the weekend because my brother works night shift and at night it’s just me and my mom alone in the house which terrifies me (I’m a female). So having him here at night for a couple days felt like I could finally breathe a little bit knowing I’m not the only one here to protect my mom if something happens. 

This morning I wake up to screaming and slamming doors - they got into a huge fight and he ended up leaving and now they’ve “broken up” (they go through this cycle every few months and get right back together). 

Some of my trauma involves my biological dad’s anger and abuse and I grew up constantly with slamming doors and screaming and walking on eggshells, and my soon-to-be ex’s wife abuse, dealing with the same thing on top of the constant gaslighting, insults, screaming, and never knowing what was going to push her over the edge. I’m already on edge and hearing others screaming and arguing takes me right back to listening to my dad scream at my mom when I was a kid, when I would listen to make sure she was safe while simultaneously try to distract my brother so that he wouldn’t overhear what they were saying. It also took me right back to my relationship with my ex which was an absolute nightmare and another story altogether. My dad’s abuse and one particular event with him are what lead to me being diagnosed with PTSD 2 years ago, but my ex’s abuse has added another layer entirely to it. Any run-in with anger is just another reminder of her and our relationship. 

On top of that, I’m still scared for my own physical safety because everything else going on, he left the house in a storm of anger and now it’s going to be me and my mom alone at night for the next week. My mom is really angry about his behavior and I’m doing my best to listen and support her the way that she did during my relationship with my ex, but hearing his screaming this morning pushed me over the edge. I feel so overstimulated and it was such an exhausting week, I was looking forward to at the very least feeling physically safe for a couple days and now even that is gone. 

I just took a Xanax to try and calm down and I’m about to smoke (CBD, can’t smoke THC). I’m so frustrated with myself, I was looking forward to the weekend to have a couple days off work and there was a lot I wanted to get done - I wanted to go out and enjoy myself and I have errands, laundry etc to do but now I feel like I can’t move and I’m wasting my days off shutting down and doing nothing. I have no idea what’s going to happen with my mom’s stalker having possibly found her and I’m taking steps to protect us that I haven’t mentioned here but I need someone to tell me that right now it’s okay and in this moment I’m safe. That I’m not a failure for shutting down and letting these emotions take me over. That it’s okay to break down. Because I feel so weak and overwhelmed right now. 

Thank you to anyone who reads this. I could use any kind, encouraging words right now. :(",mmxcv,2019-04-06 17:10:15,2,822,32.95,30.47,93.66,2.38,25.69,14.72,95.13,60.22,20.56,14.23,11.19,0.49,0.24,1.82,0.49,6.33,4.99,14.23,9,6.93,8.15,1.7,17.64,3.77,1.22,1.46,0.61,2.55,7.79,2.43,5.11,1.22,1.82,0.73,10.1,2.19,0.12,2.19,1.95,10.71,1.7,1.46,2.07,1.82,1.34,2.8,3.04,0.24,1.58,0.61,2.07,0.73,0.85,0,0.36,7.66,2.07,1.09,2.92,1.34,1.09,4.14,11.8,0.97,18.37,2.92,9,7.42,0.97,0.61,0.97,0,0,0,1.34,0.24,0.24,0.36,0.24,0,13.75,3.65,3.04,0.12,0,0.12,0,0.85,0.24,4.62,0.97,0.12
bacc62,Need advice please,"I was diagnosed with PTSD, a psychiatric in 2016 said that I scored some  74 points on some test which she described as ""concerning and severe"" I  haven't got any medication or therapy since then, I was in California  now I am in Nevada. It was spousal abuse. I have been alone for about  three years, I have no family members nearby not on the continent and I  have no friends.

Nothing good happens and I wake up everyday with  the awful feeling of ""why did I wake up"". I blamed myself for too long. I  think that God hates me. I either sit alone in bed and cry or sit alone  in bed and waste my time on youtube. I have nothing to live for. I  never told my parents about my problems. I forget all the time, very  very badly.

hey all

I never really considered myself to have childhood ptsd until I started reading more about it and realizing I meet a lot of the criteria, like reoccurring flashbacks and being unable to be productive due to said trauma replays 

if I’m not using the right terminology or anything I apologize, and would appreciate corrections 

most significantly though, I fit the criteria of attempting to recreate my traumatic event, for some reason. for me this meant seducing and sleeping with older women (between 2-8 years older) as a minor. thankfully, I’ve settled down into a serious relationship with my current girlfriend who understands the situation 

I’ve always considered myself a trauma survivor, but the title of having ptsd is new to me, as I initially thought it was only for combat survivors

I’m glad to have found a new community of support, although it could have been with sweeter circumstances

baesu5,Is a common symptom the fear that it will happen again?,"I'm just gonna jump right in
When I was very young (about 4) my father held me and my mother hostage, threatened to kill both of us, and then proceeded to kill himself instead. I have a hard time remembering this event but the feeling is still very real.
My fathers death has always been an incredibly difficult issue to the point of where  the thought of him used to be a trigger. 
I've noticed that times of serious set backs in my mental health surrounding my trauma usually happens after the death/severe health issue of a family member or someone close to me.
I feel myself ""relapse"" after these events (the first major one being the death of my grandmother and the second major one was the hospitalization of my boyfriend which I am still suffering from) and after these things I feel like I'm more easily triggered and my symptoms feel considerably worse
After the scare with my boyfriend (who has made a complete recovery), I have found myself unable to recover and I am scared that yet another person in my life is going to die and hurt me.

bag8kh,One of my abusers (my brother) wants to go to the movies with me? TW: sexual assault,"When I was in elementary school, my brother who is 4 years older than me, molested me. 
I don’t know exactly how old I was, probably between 8 and 10 years old, meaning that he would have been 12 - 14 years old. I blocked it from my memory until I was in high school and pain from a yeast infection and having sex with my boyfriend at the time brought all of the memories back.  We never spoke much while growing up, he mostly ignored me and always had friends over and parties in his room. 

I’m middle school, I got really drunk with him and his friends one night and totally blacked out. I was 12, he was 16. After all his friends left I passed out in bed, and I have a vague memory of him coming in and fingering me, but I’m not sure if this happened or if it was a bad dream. 

Our mom passed away when I was 10, he was 14. 
Our dad was very abusive before and after that event and my home life was absolutely traumatizing until I left home at 17 to go to college and my life changed completely. 

I have seen him a few times since moving out, once at a wedding that I regret going to, another time at my grandma’s funeral. 

He now wants to meet up and go to see a movie. It’s a movie of a tv show that he told me to watch, before the memories of the molestation came back to me.  We watched it separately but I loved the show. Now years later, I’m 24 and he’s 28. He texted me asking if I have any interest going to see it with him and I said sure. 
I feel scared and nervous and anxious about it. 
I don’t know if I should have just ignored him. 
I feel bad for him because he never got his life together, and still lives at home with my abusive father. I don’t know what to do.",bunbunsylvia,2019-04-07 06:29:34,4,359,31.1,39.02,90.78,1.53,17.1,12.81,95.54,59.61,21.73,17.83,11.42,1.11,0,5.29,0,3.9,3.9,14.21,8.36,5.29,8.91,1.67,18.94,3.9,2.23,1.39,4.18,1.67,5.85,1.39,4.46,0.84,1.11,0.28,12.26,1.95,1.11,0.56,6.69,12.53,2.79,1.11,2.51,2.51,3.06,3.06,3.62,1.95,0.56,1.11,3.06,0.28,1.67,0.56,0.28,6.96,4.46,0,1.39,0.56,0.56,8.36,8.91,1.39,19.5,3.62,7.24,9.19,1.39,1.95,1.39,0,0,0.28,0.28,0,0,0.28,0,0,13.37,5.29,4.18,0.28,0,0.28,0,0.28,0,2.51,0.56,0

He doesn't want to suggest things he would want to do because he's afraid of me having flashbacks or getting upset. I can't do certain things because of the trauma and apparently these are things he would want to do. I have tried sometimes to do those because some of those i enjoy myself too but i almost every time i get flashbacks. He said that he can see disgust in my face at some point. This makes me feel really bad, i want to be enough for him and that disgust- thing made me most upset. Because i want to do some things, i like them but i get flashbacks. Why is that?

bagqbm,Coworker doesn’t understand that sometimes I need a minute.,"Most of my coworkers know I have “something” up with me so they’re usually understanding when I need a moment. These are few and far between but they happen.

Today I really needed one when I walked by someone at work that smelled like the person who traumatized me and I couldn’t stop crying or hyperventilating. It’s the first time I’ve been confronted with something like that and I felt like I was back in that place.

I took a break to try and calm my breathing when we got a support message (I work in a hotel, we get support messages from guests and customer service). 

I didn’t acknowledge the message immediately and my coworker came to find me and tell me to do it instead of just clearing the message herself. She found me while I was crying and listening to one of those breathe along videos. 

I just needed a minute to breathe but instead she told me to get over whatever it is “this time” and answer the message. 

These kinds of incidents don’t happen often. I acknowledge when they do and try to keep them brief so I don’t burden my coworkers but that comment just got to me because sometimes they happen. 

I can’t imagine looking at someone who is clearly distressed and telling them to get over it. This was the worst flashback or episode or whatever you want to call it I’ve had to date and I’m barely keeping myself together today. 

I wish I could be better. I wish I could just get over it. But I can’t.

bagvfq,Serious marriage issues + PTSD and anxiety. Long story but would appreciate your time.,"My best friend invited me to come to Colorado to her friends wedding that she was officiating. When we got there, that is when I met Ken (Ken is a F2M trans person). Imagine a park ranger persona type of person, tattoos, big smile on his face while having his hands on his hips and looking up at the sky. That's Ken. We hung out together a lot. It was very obvious that we had interest. One night, we laid on the mountain top staring at the sky, talking, laughing.  He then told me passively about his gf, I was kinda bummed out, but enjoyed the friendship. The next night, he asked me what I thought about polygamy. That was unexpected, and I never thought about it. I told him just that, nodded his head and started talking about an old crush of his who broke his heart, who he didn't trust anymore (Sara). I listened to it all in stride, having a fun time. Also to note, Ken has an extremely mild case of Aspbergers.

After all that, the next few months were a lot of texting/calling. Casual conversation. At that time I wasnt sure what kind of relationship he had with Angela (gf). Was it open? I admitted to him one night that I had a crush on him, he reciprocated and that changed things. I asked about Angela and he told me he was looking to end things with her, but didnt want to hurt her feelings. I told him not to string her along, and he agreed. He said that she agreed to his need for 'free love'. The next month I came to visit him and have fun. Angela was there 90% of the time, she came over and he would 100% ignore me and get all cuddly and schmoozy with her. I felt like I was entertaining myself, or in a uncomfortable situation. I mentioned it to him cause he seemed oblivious, and he told me she wanted to be there so he had to prove all was well to keep her happy. The one day she didnt come over we slept in bed and had sex. He had said they had an open thing, so I thought it was ok. I mentioned the fact I liked the idea of a relationship with him &amp; he acted like he didnt want to make commitments. Remember, 'free-love' guy. The next night we (Angela too) went to a gay club and he was allll over this guy there. He was talking to me about him like ""mmm I bet he is fun ;) I got his number"". That night Angela spent the night with him and I slept on the air mattress.  The next night, I got a call from my mom saying that my dad unexpectedly took a turn for the worst and was intubated. I went back home the next day to find he was dying. He died later that night of severe sepsis with all us around him. The hardest moment of my life.

The next few months, me and Ken continued to talk. Him and Angela's relationship was still there, and he just kept saying he was intending on ending it. Then he said he would wait till he got back from Cali (a trip to visit family/Ken to meet family). He procrastinated cause he didnt want to hurt her feelings/deal with it. After the trip, he messaged telling me he did it. I was glad and glad she wasn't being strung along.

After a few more visits, we talked vaguely about me moving down. At this point Ken was in a ""can't we just be"" instead of committing zone. I wanted more but tried to open up to his thoughts. I didn't want to push it. Our interest in each other grew. I was willing to see what happens. About 2 days before I moved down Ken told me casually and with happy inflection that he got the random guy that he hit on/wanted to sleep with at the bar to move in (Matt). I hung up lol. He called back like ""did I say something wrong?""  I told him I wasnt going to be in that uncomfortable situation again and he reassured me it is just for extra $ and he needed a place to stay. He had no interest. I accepted that. I moved down. Matt and Ken didn't do anything, they clashed and Ken couldnt stand him after a few months. Ken and I became emotionally attached. He told me he was in love with me. He often told me at random, or if I asked...that I am enough for him and he doesnt want anyone else. For the entire relationship, he instilled that. A year later he asked me to marry him...and for someone who was so afraid of commitment, that stunned me. Around this time, my health anxiety came about. I am a severe hypochondriac with PTSD like issues from excessive, past trauma. I am currently being evaluated, but multiple terms have been discussed. I have had this issue since I was 5 and it fluctuates or disappears. My folks instilled that going to a therapist would land me in a padded room. They felt it was my duty to manage my own mind. So I always severely avoided therapists. I told ken openly that I was a hypochondriac with severe anxiety and he was understanding. At this point, I hadn't had that side of me appear yet. 

A month later, I was on Kens laptop. I ended up getting on the internet and went to my FB. He was still logged in and I kinda pondered for a min. I saw he messaged Sara and it was suggestive. Like, talking bout how good she was ""with your fingers ;)"" (they had a minor sexual encounter previously) and other flirty things. The problem was this was RECENT. She was discussing wanting to take him to Hawaii. That night, I showed him that I saw his msgs, and I was pissed. He wanted to sit with me and run through the convo to clarify it meant nothing. And that they always talked like that jokingly. That he thought about Hawaii, but wouldn't do anything. That he just wanted a free vacation cause he felt he deserved it after hotwiring her 3000$ 3 years before to get her teeth fixed. The whole thing smelled of BS. I then did the worst thing out of BLINDING ANGER. The worst thing I have ever done. I made a faux Sara acct spiting me in order to get Ken to stop talking to her. I was a total shit for it. The whole thing did go through and he deleted her. I didn't feel good about it, why would I? I knew I had to admit to Ken what I did, no matter the cost. I knew the consequences; leaving me, him talking to her again, kicked out, I don't know..but I was prepared for whatever, so I told him. His reaction was, like it wasnt a big deal. He wasn't upset. He told me he didnt have any interest in talking to her anyways so he was going to just keep it that way. 

Through the arguments over the years, seldomly I would fly off about her if we were talking about her or something relevant. Like the term ""your precious fucking Sara"" came out of my mouth a handful of times. He'd just get into IDC mode or be hurt that I would doubt his feelings/what he says. 
   
A few months later my health anxiety got bad. It coincided with the wedding stress. My hobbies all stopped. All that existed was my fears. For the next few years the anxiety would came &amp; went. I would be so out of it, that my surroundings were cloudy. Not paying attention. I would ask irrational health fears to ken which, initially he was fine with, but then it was a regular thing and he couldn't deal with it.  His personal issues surrounding it werent getting addressed from me cause of my mindset.  If he were to talk about how he feels and I was focused and there, it was often he would say something painful about me or us that I didnt know how to respond other than shock or sadness when he was looking for acceptance, so he thought I wasnt prioritizing his feelings. He pushed me many times to go to a psychologist, and I would always put it off, try and get better on my own, fail, and repeat. This is something that fluctuated. I kept meaning to go, but I just got clammy and scared over it. I tried so hard to keep it in myself and not burden him cause...I didn't want to burden him with it anymore. Hes my husband, not a crutch. Throughout the on/off bouts..our lives were, good. We both worked at ACE together, a house, a great routine..and we genuinely enjoyed our time together. 5 out of 7 days Ken would wake up, wake me up with a kiss on the cheek and a snuggle in bed, get in the car, go get breakfast sandwiches, drive to work, go to a restaurant after work, try and beat eachothers score in Cribbage, go home and watch Netflix in bed, sex, and cuddle to sleep. 5 nights a week for like...2 yrs. 
Then, his folks went on a road trip to Boise and said they were looking to retire there. They wanted to fly Ken out to look at homes with them cause they wanted us to move up there too. I was unsure about this, I was comfortable, but it was an opportunity to go somewhere better and with more options. They got the house and we all drove to Idaho. I had severe suppressed/released anxiety from around February till now. A huge one. And Ken was at the end of his rope with it. We still did all the amazing cuddly, fun things together..enjoying each other but if my health anxiety seeped through, it ruined it. My sleeping habits also got severely effected, and just my general well being.  Through this all, he always maintained that  he just can't deal with my anxiety, he wants me to get help, lost hope, loves me, wants to be together, would never let me go, never forever. This was literally 2 weeks ago that he told me all that. In the arguments he would accuse me of being a liar, untrustworthy, selfish, childish, etc. 

This last Tuesday was The big Kahuna.  Ken seemed odd. I asked him on Monday in bed what was up, if he was distancing himself from me and he took a second and told me everything was good.  On Tuesday we went to eat dinner at some fancy restaurant, cracked some jokes, I asked him if he wanted to go do the $5 Tuesdays and he was all for that. Like totally excited, holding my hand, you know all the gooey lovely stuff. Which is normal and constant for us. I came home and gave him a kiss on the forehead as he was texting his best friend April and the text looked like otd be something bad about me, but when I politely asked, he bold face lied to me saying it was about something else, I could tell he was lying and asked if it were really about me and he said ""well, yes"", ""well then why did you lie to me?"", ""cause I didn't want to start a fight before the movie"" and then I got angry, not cause he was talking to April about me (which isn't a state fucking secret, I really don't care) it was him lying to me. I blew up over it. He went to the movie alone, and at the end of it texted me with this

""You've never believed how I felt about you. And you're right, I didn't know how to answer your question last night..thats why it took some time to think about. I am going to stop pretending that everything is okay cause it isn't. I don't want to sleep with you anymore, I don't want to do things with you anymore, you're not the person I want to be with. I gave you many chances to get help, I am done and I would like you to go""

You can probably imagine how I reacted, bawled like a baby. I called him making a complete ass out of myself saying he couldn't have meant that, he loves me, Im sorry, I will go to a therapist, etc...and he just looked at me like ..get a hold of yourself. He has never said that or ever indicated EVER that he wanted that. Everytime, even weeks before he said he would never leave me, loves me too much, etc. At home i said 
""Please, i am sorry...""
""it's too late""
""do you really want me to leave?""
""YES""
""for good?""
""for now""
 ""I will get help for real I will!""
 ""What, you think going to a therapist will make me suddenly have feelings for you again?"" 
""you don't love m---??""
""I am going to bed""
""but.."" 
""BED. I have to be up at 6"" (shuts door). not a tear, not a care, not even anger...just a fed up-ness. Once I got a hold of myself I wrote him an extensive text stating how I need help, and I can't pretend any longer that I can deal with it on my own, and how I can't use him as a crutch and that I don't blame him for being fed up with it, that it sucks I needed a massive push but I am going to do it and hope it betters myself as a standalone human cause I can't affect people like this. I wrote him basically that (summarized). He didn't respond Wednesday, I contacted every single therapist in town to get an appt in asap...and got one for Friday. My sister was resoundingly proud, (crying actually) that I was really going to do this. She'd only been pushing me for 20 years lol. I did everything I could to improve at the quality of my day to help clear my head. I cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, myself, got a decent sleep schedule, made dinner. Ken came home, and seemed...jubilant...about his day (which is normal. His #1 priority is the quality of his day/job/hobby. He wont let ANYTHING disturb that...hence why he wants to get rid of me and went to bed mid breaking my heart. That's very normal for him. One of his biggest complaints about me in our relationship is me keeping him up past his bedtime. Like he said I dont care about his well being cause I was in a talking mood at the wrong time. Or I would be on my phone in bed and it would keep him up so I'd put the covers over me so it didn't bother/he wouldnt see. He considered that sneaky lying.) So yeah, jubilant just with his day. The bizarre thing was him being sporadically extremely nice/normal to me but also very distant. I got 1 text from him ""I am glad you go an appointment, We'll see how it goes but I want space at home"". I respected that, and didn't bother him. And went on faith.

Thursday I cooked, made cupcakes, got groceries, still giving him his space. At this point in my head I was done with the 'pining' 'mindset and just...tried to find the positive in that, everything happens for a reason, and maybe my stubborn ass needed a slap to put me in the place I really need to be. So in a small way, I looked forward to my appt. I talked to my sister and she understood his need to distance himself, to say ""you know what? I am fed up, I can't do this any more unless you get help. I'm done"" but made it clear that if I follow through and really give it my 1200% and he still wants out then that is really shitty and says very little about the vows he made. I talked to April that night who basically was like ""I think he is done. I was really excited you were finally getting that help, I just don't think that hope was shared"". 

The next day was my appt and fuuuck. Sitting across from a woman staring at you, talking about your entire life story in order to be assessed was hard. I picked my fingers till they bled I was so nervous. She was worried about PTSD, and it manifesting in some tangible way. She could tell I was extremely nervous and tried to calm me down. Afterward though, it felt...okay. like, I did it, and I will continue to. When I got home, Ken was there. He started talking to me and I took that as it was safe to talk too. He was happy I went, proud maybe..but wary. He was still in that 'place' but he was really seeing I am ding my part, and will continue to. He told me spontaneously then that he started talking to Sara again. My brain went blank. like the blankest stare into nothingness. Normally, I would be upset, but I was composed (but dying on the inside). He literally handed me his phone and said I am more than welcome to look at the texts. I was not ready for it. I just got Ken to talk and then this sunk me back to an even worse place. I read the texts and I literally could not believe my eyes.

""Why did you add me again?""

""I wanted to apologize for unfriending you years ago""

(proceeded to tell the literal entire story of when I made that fake account years ago, and how fucked up it was...the one I admitted to and he didn't even seem bothered by/said he didn't have any desire to talk to her anyway. Also told her I 'snooped' on their messages that time and it was totally ""fucked up""....the messages he literally encouraged i read through with and was understanding about and told me I was more than welcome to look at any of his stuff to prove he has nothing to hide )

""Omg! Why would you marry someone like that?""

""I contemplated calling it off when I found out, but I had too much money on the venue. I wanted to add you back all these years but I didnt want to make her mad, and I didnt know if it would really be you I was talking to you this time. I don't care what she sees anymore (see what?).""

""Don't worry, she's out of my life for good, how are you?""

(and literally the following is just a plethora of giddy 6-7am conversations with him talking about how beautiful the sunrise is there, etc and many phone calls.)

I was FUMED. I walked out to have a cigarette to try and compose myself. I asked him to come out and talk with me.
Me:""that was some painful things you said""
Him: ""yeah, I knew it would be tough for you to hear""
Me: ""Do you like her?""
Him: ""no, I messaged her to apologize and to have a friend back"" 
Me: ""you told her you contemplated marrying me then?"" 
Him: ""Yeah, I did..that was such a big lie""
Me: ""it was, and I told you flat out I did it and you let it go"" 
Him: ""well thats cause I already knew and had time to process. I actually found it on your computer."" 
Me: "" What? You didn't tell me that""
Him: *shrugs*
Me: Was it true about why you continued with the wedding?""
Him: ""I did it cause I love you""
Me: ""No, you said to her you stuck with it cause of the down payment on the venue"" Him: ""Stop. Why do you do that? Why do you always jump to conclusions and not take what I say? I love you and thats why I did it. The $ was secondary."" 
Me: ""Do you really want a divorce?""
Him: ""I thought about it the other day yeah.""
Me: ""But, doesnt that even bother you?"" 
Him: ""you arent allowed to ask me about my emotions yet till you earn it"" 
Me: ""okay..I just don't understand why that extreme. We love each other.""
Him: ""You can be divorced and still in love. Lots of divorced people are in love...""
Him: ""I want to be with you. I love you. I never wanted it to get to this point, to contemplate leaving you, but I don't want to live like this (cries) with you refusing help."" 
Me: ""I am going to someone, I am really on this. This is it""
Him: ""I want to see you get help and I want you back""

 Later I said, verbatim ""I am going to try and be okay with the Sara thing. It hurts, i hate it, I don't understand it, but I am trying here"" and he said ""you arent going to dictate who I want to talk to or who I want to be friends with. Its none of your business"". He has made it very clear that I have to earn him back and that if I am not cool with something, tough shit. 

 How could he say all those things? I have him back, kinda. Now he is in a...'it is going to take some time to earn my trust back but I want the anxietyless you cause I love you and I am proud you will get help' mode. I am going to continue to do my part, to do me, to fix myself...but like...I feel just...I don't even know. The Sara thing is extremely uncomfortable...and I don't know if that is something that I am overreacting over or he really is not doing right.

bahlfj,PTSD-related podcasts or other audio,"When I'm having a rough time I get some sort of solace from listening to podcasts and radio talk programs.  I'm really interested in theory of trauma, self-help and spirituality related to trauma and hearing other trauma survivors stories. I haven't found that many podcasts that cover these issues. Sometimes listening to people talking about spiritual, psychological or medical issues related to trauma, pain, hardships and stuff like that sort of like puts me back on the right tracks and keeps me focused on healing, self-care and going forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really like Tara Brach and her talks. These talks for example cover topics related to trauma:  [https://www.tarabrach.com/fear/](https://www.tarabrach.com/fear/)  There are many more. The foundation of her thinking is closely related to mindfulness and buddhism. I'm sure there are lots of other good spiritual audio online, but do you know more that's related to trauma somehow?

&amp;#x200B;

The Mental Illness Happy Hour has some episodes related to trauma:  [https://mentalpod.com/?s=trauma](https://mentalpod.com/?s=trauma) I've listened to only couple of episodes and it seems like the quality of the episodes depend a lot on the guest. I don't always like the host but he's ok mostly :) 

&amp;#x200B;

I think Sounds True's Healing Trauma Summit ( [https://www.soundstrue.com/store/healing-trauma-summit/free-access-c](https://www.soundstrue.com/store/healing-trauma-summit/free-access-c) ) has some really good content but it's really expensive in my opinion. There seems to be some free access for limited amount of time but I don't know how it works. I'm not sure if it's worth it to pay hundreds of dollars for these talks. I did and I don't regret it because I got some sparks of hope from these talks. They have many of the big names in trauma research like Peter Levine and Pat Ogden and all of the talkers are researchers and professionals, but I feel like maybe you can get more bang for your buck by reading books like The Body Keeps The Score by Van Der Kolk. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have more suggestions?

bahunq,"Private disciplinary schools (TW: physical restraint, corporal punishment)","Did anyone here get sent to a private disciplinary school (mine also had some intellectually disabled kids) as a child? (I live in the US). They were allowed to physically restrain us if they deemed us a threat to ourselves or others, but most of the time they took it too far and put excessive pressure on us as a form of corporal punishment. I remember being 8 years old and having a 160lb woman sit on top of me while I cried in a puddle of my own tears and snot, and she taunted me after she got off me like it wasn't a big deal. I could barely fucking move and it makes me so angry. This is just one time of many. Another time, I walked in to school with my fists balled, got called out by the teacher, and 30 minutes later (after I had calmed down) he took me in another room and slammed me against a corner while he gave me a 'lecture' about not balling my fists in his room. I wasn't much older and this guy was probably 3-400 lbs. 

 But I don't feel like I was abused. I mean growing up, we were told this was allowed and I'm pretty sure it still is done there.

bam2j2,I was diagnosed in preschool yet never got any real help,"I was severely traumatized from witnessing my “father” attack my mother constantly. She got away when I was three but the damage was done. This wasn’t slapping or hitting. This was intense beatings that resulted in blood and vomit coming from her. By the time we were away and I was in preschool, I was not ok. I was exhibiting extreme signs of PTSD and by the end of preschool I had a therapist going there once a week to talk to me and observe. More bad things happened that I get flashes of but the main time I ALWAYS go back to was when my mom was unconscious and I could smell blood and vomit. I was not able to understand death but I live through the INTENSE feeling she wasn’t going to wake up constantly.

I literally was in therapy from preschool into early adulthood and doctors have always mentioned the PTSD but never ever offered any sort of counseling or therapy for it. Always meds for the insomnia. Meds for the anxiety. Meds for the depression. I have tried countless times to get help for this and it results in a prescription. I have gone to the ER and ended up in mental hospitals and it results in a prescription. I feel like I get blown off or maybe because of how I look or that I’m a woman, I get labeled as not in immediate danger or some shit.

It is effecting me now more than ever. I am TORTURING my boyfriend and ruining his life because of the demon inside me. I am two different people. I feel this so strong at this point in my life. And the real me has to deal with the embarrassment, shame, guilt, everything the demon me does. I need help. I tried in the last two years, I called a crisis center during a bad anxiety episode. I told them I need REAL HELP NOT MEDS for this. I was out the next day after an episode I had there. They told me they can’t help me, to find somewhere else, they didn’t even give me any resources.

I am mentally crippled. I no longer leave the house. My boyfriend takes care of me and I treat him bad. I’m abusing him. It doesn’t matter that I’m sick, it’s still abuse. I ruined his life today.  I am ruining everything.  I just want help. I don’t understand why I’m begging for it and it’s not coming. I don’t know if anyone on here can relate but I truly do not believe I’m the only person with PTSD who gets cast aside while seeking help. I really need help. I cannot ask enough. Please God, anybody, please help me. Tell me what I have to say to be heard. I won’t keep living like this. I refuse. One way or another, I will not keep this going.  Whether I go to a real fucking loony bin, or a grave, this is not going to continue.

I want to be admitted into a hospital or facility that will treat this. I have been unsuccessful. I’m 30 years old. I started being vocal about the flashbacks and shrieking taking over my life in my teens. It’s embarrassing when I start yelling over nothing. I need help. I refused to seriously date anyone until my mid twenties because I’m ashamed of what is inside of me. I fell in love and now I torture him. This isn’t normal. I live in Massachusetts in the cape. If anyone reading this can please tell me if I can get real help in this area, please please please tell me.",imruiningeverything,2019-04-07 15:35:26,6,626,26.57,9.53,96.98,1.58,11.38,14.7,91.53,59.11,21.88,15.65,13.58,0.16,0,1.28,0.64,6.07,4.95,12.14,9.74,4.63,7.03,3.51,19.17,2.4,1.44,1.44,1.12,1.12,7.19,2.08,5.11,1.12,1.28,0.96,9.74,0.48,0.48,0.96,1.28,13.42,1.92,1.44,1.6,3.51,1.76,5.59,1.28,0.16,0.48,0.48,4.15,0.64,3.19,0.16,0,7.51,2.4,0.64,3.83,1.6,0.8,5.59,12.3,1.44,14.06,1.76,5.91,6.55,0.48,0,0.16,0.16,0.48,0.32,0.64,0.32,0,0.16,0.16,0,14.38,8.63,2.4,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,3.04,0,0

baoolt,my therapist makes me feel insecure,"sometimes she can be the nicest person and I feel like she understands me but she also judges me, and makes me feel down.

the thing is that I usually wake up feeling lost, not being able to move my own body or to even respond, it usually happens after a nightmare, although I am awake and aware of my surroundings, my body is still asleep and it doesn’t let me respond, while I keep thinking and reliving the nightmare or the thought.
this became more and more rare as I went to therapy.

one day that I felt sick(headache, i felt numb and dizzy) at school, it happened, somehow I ended up in “academic orientation” waiting for my mom, my [at the time] boyfriend had called my mom so she could pick me up, the school workers recommended my mom to take me to urgency, where they said I was totally fine, I was just in a “state of shock”.

later on, feeling better, I had a meeting with my therapist that suggested that I did that so my boyfriend stayed with me and I could ruin his plans, I tried to explain that I didn’t know that his plans of going out, where on that day, neither whom he was going out with, but it didn’t matter cause she didn’t believe me, and she keeps repeating that every time making me feel like a bad person.

she often asks me how am I with my friends, and it doesn’t even matter what I answer she always interrupts me saying loudly “LIE! you don’t have any friends” that really makes me feel bad about myself.

I should be going twice a week but I haven’t been to therapy on awhile, so I am very scared of what she is going to say about it and about my recent break up, I am afraid that if I say that it’s okay and it’s not the end of the world she wouldn’t believe me or say I just didn’t love him.

Other times it's like it's a song replaying in my mind, it's stuck and I can't get rid of it or really think of anything else. It's like flashing images of the memory in my head and it leads to some zoning out or dissociating, I get really snappy and irrirable. 
In both ""types"" of flashbacks I sometimes even feel pressure on my skin, like a grip from a mans hand that I feel but it's also not really there (obviously) 

These flashbacks/panic attacks are keeping me up at night, I hyperventilate and breakdown. I'm not a big crier but lately it's all I can do and I don't know how to cope with these. I don't have any coping tools for these moments, I have some valium that I can take sometimes but I'm not in control of when I have access. During these times I often hurt myself by hitting, scratching, pinching and pulling at my hair because I'm in such a panic. 
Most people around me dismiss it, there's really only one person I can turn to and I don't want to have to everytime because that's a lot of pressure and baggage to throw on them. 

This is ruining my sleep, ability to leave the house and socialise, it's causing more anxiety in me because I'm now also fearing going out or being with people since I don't want them to see me like that. It's been about 3 years since the incident that causes these problems for me and I feel like it should be getting better not worse. 

Does anyone have any tips or advice for learning how to cope and manage? Maybe decrease the length or intensity of these flashbacks?

bapw5o,"What to do with comments like, “People have been through even worse than you”, etc. ?","Most people I talk to (which isn’t many anyway) don’t make comments like this, but some do at times. Like, “others who’ve gone through what you’ve been through, and even worse”. I know there is a time for this, for ~perspective, but it doesn’t help me. I know that other people have experienced worse, other people haven’t survived experiences like I had, and then I end up feeling even weaker because it’s like I should be okay. If I didn’t go through the worst situation then I should be okay. 

I know that not real. I know it doesn’t work that way. But then I start to think that the person I’m talking to thinks this too. That because I’m alive, my experience wasn’t bad enough to warrant the PTSD affecting me this much.

bapy3x,Can you have PTSD even if you don't remember seeing or experiencing anything traumatic?,"I'm not trying to self-diagnose myself or anything, but I do have a few symptoms associated with it. I just can't think of anything that I've been through that was traumatic. I've been startled by my mom yelling on the phone whenever something bad has happened. Like the time my sister got into a fight with her ex husband. Or the time that same sister got into a fight with my other sister. My mom always sounds like someone is getting murdered, and it really scares me, until I find out that it's not as bad as it sounded.

 Another thing is that I used to look up creepy images online. Despite being an adult, some of them would cause me to have trouble sleeping. Then again, there's a subreddit dedicated to this sort of stuff, so I doubt that's it.

 The last thing is that my mom claims my dad had abused me when I was young. But it had to be when I was really young because I don't remember any of it, and he was out of my life by age 5 or 6.

bauvlo,Filed for disability,"I should've filed a while ago :( but it took a bit to come to terms with it.
I've been living off kindness of family and friends and it's gotta end. I've tried and failed jobs. The longest job I've ever had was only a year. I hope I don't have to be on it forever. But for now I really need to get my shit fixed. I stopped trying to get jobs because I'm scared of failing one again. Just thinking about it right now is setting off my anxiety.

I was gonna leave this out but I feel like I have to justify myself. I think the last couple jobs just retraumatized me. One of them the manager was the spitting image of my abuser. I had flashbacks and panic attacks daily. It didn't help they were a mean cunt too, who called my PTSD 'bullshit'. I'd try and compose myself in the bathroom at work, but it would take up to an hour sometimes. So then I started getting in trouble for that and told I can't just stay in there all day. I'd have tons of sick days. They were lenient enough to not fire me for them but part of me wished they did.
Finally one day I was doing my best to stay together, before I realized that the problem that day was because it was an anniversary, but I just had it. I had been called back and yelled at about whether I wanted the job still or to just sign a resignation letter. I just said ""ok"" and walked out.

My SO wasn't happy with that decision :(

Then the latest job I was only there for a couple months. It started out okay, but then I just got worse and worse. I had tons of sick days because my flashbacks were causing extreme fatigue and muscle pain afterwards. Once I finally got back I had the worst one to date. I felt off all day and then anxious, and then nausea. I had a flashback out of nowhere. I puked and dropped to the ground, and this scared a customer outside the place to come back in. A cop stayed with me until my (very pissed) manager came in at like 2am to take over so I could leave. It was humiliating... 

It's been like a year since then and I only just started feeling okay enough to even go near the place.

I'm only 23, I feel like such a piece of shit. And while I know it's really hard to get disability, and I guess even harder for mental health problems. I just sorta wish someone in my life would kindly say something to me like ""hey, it's okay to do this"". Because I feel like it's not? Like I'm acting or not worth it.

bayvrk,How the hell do you accept long term therapy?,"Mobile, sorry for errors.

I was diagnosed with PTSD 3 years ago. I think it's more likely c-ptsd, but I guess it really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of what I'm asking.

I cannot accept that I might live with PTSD forever. I don't know why. I would like to. Recently I ended my long term therapy sessions and I can't decide if this was a good choice. At the moment I'm leaning toward mixed.

On one hand, I think I got what I could get of that particular therapist. He seemed highly uncomfortable discussing how my PTSD impacted my sex life, which is directly related to my trauma. Other than this avoidance, he was pretty good. Knowledgable. 

On the other hand, I am currently in the middle of a downward spiral and that probably impaired my decision making. I think not being in therapy is making it worse. But I am also too afraid to contact anyone at the moment and, like I mentioned, I can't accept that I might not ever be ""normal"". I feel ashamed of having been in therapy for 3 years as an adult, plus most of my adolescence. I'm in mental hell right now.

I don't know what responses I'm looking for, so I appreciate anything.",whimsicalangler,2019-04-08 13:43:05,9,223,22.8,2.99,99,25.77,11.74,14.35,92.83,56.95,22.87,15.25,13.9,0,0.45,0.9,0,7.62,4.04,12.11,11.21,4.48,5.38,3.59,20.18,6.28,4.04,3.14,1.35,0.9,8.07,4.04,4.04,1.79,0.9,0.45,4.48,0,0.45,0,0.9,21.97,7.62,2.69,1.35,4.93,1.35,5.38,1.79,0.45,0,1.35,4.93,0.9,3.59,0.45,0,3.59,0,0,0.45,2.24,0.9,3.59,13.45,0.9,13.9,0.45,7.62,5.83,0.45,0,0,0,0.9,0,0.9,0.9,0,0,0,0,18.83,8.07,4.48,0,0,0.45,0,0.45,0.9,4.48,0,0
bazr6y,Writing out my traumas... I’ve repressed them for so long and I’m struggling with putting myself back in those emotions. It’s too painful.,"I recently started therapy and am tasked with writing out my traumas with sensory details and detailing how I felt and how it’s affected my life. I’m about half way through writing my experiences and I’m having major flashbacks and shaking. Truthfully, I’ve never let myself think about those things. When the traumas happened, I immediately shut down my emotions, and to this day, 7 years later, I’ve never thought about how it’s affected me, or how they made me feel. I stick to the facts of what happened. If I go any deeper than that, I shut down and start going into panic mode. I don’t KNOW how it all made me feel. I don’t want to know... As I write this, I’m filled with frustration, anger, hate, loss of hope... but I can’t get past these emotions without physically shutting down.. I can’t get to the deeper parts of myself. My brain won’t let me. This is so fucking hard. I feel so so alone and like no matter what I write will be wrong because I just don’t fucking know what I feel. I just don’t know, and I want to scream. 

I’m not sure what the point of this post is... I guess I’m just ranting, but any support or advice on how to get through this process, this first step to recovery, would be greatly appreciated.",frankyfriday,2019-04-08 14:59:20,2,254,4.66,1,99,1,12.7,17.32,94.09,59.84,24.02,16.54,15.75,0,0,0,0.79,7.48,1.57,12.99,10.63,8.66,11.02,4.72,25.2,5.12,2.76,4.33,1.18,1.18,9.84,1.97,6.69,1.57,1.97,0.79,1.18,0,0,0,0,18.11,4.72,4.33,1.97,2.76,2.36,3.94,3.54,0,0.39,2.76,2.76,0.39,1.57,0.79,0,4.33,0,1.18,1.57,1.18,0.79,3.54,17.72,1.57,13.39,1.57,6.69,5.12,1.97,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0.79,0,0,0,0,24.8,11.42,5.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.48,0,0
bb02ww,Just had my first EMDR session and WOW! TW: Childhood sexual abuse,"Finally completed my first session! It was intense and also amazing! I left there feeling liberated, freed, and powerful. 

Nobody told me that your brain will try to “change” the memory and I certainly did not expect that. I got a “breakthrough memory” as the therapist called it and I completely altered the memory of the incident we were working on. 

I told I wanted to start with an intense memory because I was able to take off work tomorrow if need be. She let me select from the list I gave her (I loved that she let me pick). 

I chose a situation that involved anal penetration. When I started, my body was tight I was cringing and squirming in my seat because that’s all I could feel. In the end, I ended up changing the outcome of the memory. I was no longer the “gross, scared, helpless girl” I was the “powerful, innocent person”. 

My memory literally built an entire situation that I slammed him in the head, he fell over, I stood over his immobilized body, then I left. I walked out of that bathroom, out of that house and stood outside. I felt more and more free with every single step. I stood outside breathing in the air with my arms out. A sense of power and freedom washes over me. It was amazing. 

WOW. when I left that building tonight, I felt liberated. I took that first big breath of fresh air and a calmness washed over me. 

I feel powerful in that situation and I feel powerful in real time. I really think this might be the treatment that works for me. I hope and hope that I am able to continue this moving forward. 

I hope I did not trigger anyone, I just feel great about the whole experience and I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it.

bb1b20,My PTSD/Emotional problems cause my realationships to be strained,"I am a likeable person. I am told that I am attractive and kind and etc. I am able to be socialable or at least act well around others. At the same time, I also struggle with emotional problems.

bb1cst,How to tell someone about your experiences without sounding like a desensitized psychopath?,"Let me start of by saying that I hate being pitied or being a burden to people. But, I want to stop lying about why I do certain things without having it devolve into a long conversation where the person is trying to be supportive. 

One of my issues is that I don’t sleep anywhere near what a normal person should be sleeping, and while it doesn’t show it certainly keeps getting brought up in conversation and I don’t know what to tell people without involving them in my life’s issues or blatant lying to them. I have already limited my time in social media, and this has somewhat helped: but how do I tell someone I can’t sleep more than a few hours because when I wake up I’m filled with a feeling I’m impending doom, angst and above all: guilt? 

I’ve only recently started picking up my life again after spending these these last almost two dozens months waiting for cancer to take my life. And while I would never take my own life, my diagnoses of cancer certainly felt like good news at the time. Righteous. Sadly (albeit now I begin to see that it was luckily) I seem to not have to look forward to cancer taking my life for the upcoming few years. And this realization has put me on the path of hyper productivity, but the guilt is still there and I don’t think it will ever go away. And while this productivity does come from the feeling like I have to repay a certain influence in my life, the same influence that helped me get an early diagnosis on the cancer; I can’t find the right words to tell someone why I’m working as hard as I do. Without making things awkward. 

I don’t know whether it would help talking more about what I went through in this post. Somehow while I’m writing this it feels like I’m blaming the person I’ve lost and cherished the most for my own issues.

bb331h,Do I have PTSD? Was in a terrorist attack nearly 2 years ago,"Hi there   
 

I was working as a stage hand on the night of the Ariana Grande concert  the night the bombing happened. I was taking down the barriers nearby  (but not in the lobby area) when the explosion happened. I was not directly injured. I was using a rattle gun (very loud) to undo alloy barriers bent down behind a barrier that rattles so hard when I use the gun on it that its all I can hear so I couldn't hear a thing. My friends said they felt the blast as it went off, I was just working really hard and fast and didnt feel it or hear it as what I was doing was already an assault on my senses.  
 

We were told to get out but couldn't leave the area, I figured out something bad was happening when I started seeing people crying and screaming, people covered in blood, including the showsec guys (they do the crowd management while we build and dismantle the stage) who were wearing yellow and had blood on their yellow tops. At this point I went  to a police officer and he told me to get out.   
 

As I left, I ran in to a police road block where police with guns were screaming at a man in a car, police were diving for cover and shouting for us to run. I U-turned the car and bundled a guy in to the car and sped off and the guy I got in the car navigated us out through side streets.   
 

In reality, I wasn't right in the blast, I wasnt injured. But since then, I've had some difficulties. I have a past (about 9 years ago) of anxiety and depression which I have been managing well and I just dont feel depressed or anxious in that way however, since this  happened, I've been getting very uncomfortable in crowds or busy places.  When I'm at work I get anxious in large groups of people (I am an instructor as my other job) and I feel afraid and uncomfortable. My heart starts racing and my breathing gets really shallow. I just want to be away from them because I feel too exposed. If  I see ANY bags left unattended I just have to walk away. It is quite often. It has got to the point where I avoid collecting my groups until  slightly after the start time so I feel comfortable enough to go there. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I hear bangs that sound like gunfire or explosions, I get really, really stressed, really quickly. heart rate, sweating, rapid shallow breathing, totally not cool about it. No one else around me who wasn't involved seems to even notice the noises. It is usually someone hammering something on a building site or someone dropping something flat as it slaps the ground, unexpected fireworks, stuff like that.  
 

The thing is, I'm not a timid person. I race, I used to be a boxer. I jump off cliffs for fun, I jump of big jumps in skate parks. I  do rope access and deal with danger just fine. But this is different,  it's panic and I just dont experience this problem in any other part of  my life. Once it started to affect my work, I noticed I might not be in control of it.   
 

I'm worried I might have a little bit of PTSD, but I dont know. I dont think it's severe, I don't know much about it either.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose I'm looking for some people to give me a bit of guidance on whether they think this is a problem or not, whether it is diagnosable and what I should do.

bb36j3,I think my breakup triggered PTSD,"A month ago today, my girlfriend of just over a year told me that she didn’t think she loved me anymore. We talked for a couple hours and, to be honest, I’m still absolutely shocked. We had been drifting apart over the past couple months but we acknowledged it and we both came to the conclusion that she is very stressed with her university program and I am in the process off changing careers. I used to be a paramedic. Two and a half years ago I was in a very near miss plane crash while working in a remote northern community were we would medevac patients to a larger center. At the time, I did what I always do when faced with a traumatic event in my life, I pushed it down, told myself it was nothing and moved on. During the course of the relationship it was brought to my attention that I was, for lack of a better term, cold and robotic. She couldn’t have been more amazing in helping me out of my shell and, for the first time in many, many years, I was able to open up about my feelings. I was able to address when the whole, bottle it up and not feel anything anymore started. I was moving in a positive direction which, actually allowed me to help her deal with some of the things that she was going through too. Since the breakup I’ve been feeling sad and scared. I’ve been unable to sleep and, when I do finally get to sleep, I’ve started having nightmares again. I realized the other day on my drive home from work that I’ve been scared without her. She made me feel safe and that everything was going to be alright.

It brings up horrible feelings that make me feel like I'm worthless after all of my assaults..ugh..am I alone on this feeling?",pinkhidespider,2019-04-08 22:49:56,8,126,18.82,56.31,76.81,1,31.5,19.05,95.24,61.11,23.02,13.49,7.94,0,3.17,0,2.38,9.52,3.97,11.9,11.11,7.14,5.56,2.38,23.81,4.76,2.38,1.59,0.79,0.79,7.94,1.59,6.35,2.38,0.79,1.59,12.7,0,1.59,0,0,22.22,7.14,3.17,3.97,6.35,2.38,3.97,3.17,0,0,3.17,3.17,0,1.59,1.59,0,10.32,1.59,0.79,3.17,2.38,2.38,1.59,17.46,0,10.32,1.59,3.17,6.35,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,0,0,0,0.79,0,13.49,8.73,0.79,0,0,2.38,0,0,0,1.59,0,0

bb55h3,Can you get PTSD from hearing about (not living through) a traumatic event?,"Hi all. So a little background: I'm 22 years old with a history of anxiety disorder and OCD. Without going into too much identifying information, my father passed away in a natural disaster about 6 months ago in my hometown. 

I live about 5 hours away by plane from my family. When I arrived in my hometown a few days later, I saw how devastated it was by this natural disaster. It's difficult to explain what I was feeling, but connecting the way my hometown was destroyed with the reason I was there; it emotionally wrecked me. 

When I was unsparingly told the details of how my dad died by one of the investigators assigned to his case (there were eyewitnesses), a mental image started going through my head over and over. Hell, before I even knew all the details my mind was already replaying these images. Every time the event unfolded in my head it became more grusome and frightening. Every time it rains or the wind is really bad, it spurs these images. Every time I start to think about my dad, it spurs the images. Sometimes they come on without warning. For the first few months I would get nightmares basically nightly replaying the scene and either it was my dad, myself, or someone else I cared about experiencing this event. The nightmares are not nearly as bad now, but they still affect me from time to time. The images, however, have not gone away.

So my question is, even though I neither experienced the natural disaster as it was happening, nor did I witness my dad's death; is it possible I've developed PTSD? I'm currently seeing (and was seeing before my dad passed away) both a psychiatrist and therapist for grief counseling and management of my anxiety and OCD,  but neither clinician has mentioned PTSD as a diagnosis. Has anyone ever heard of someone developing ""second hand PTSD"" so to speak?",PyroMouse44,2019-04-09 00:49:01,4,338,48.99,14.34,98.07,1,17.79,21.01,90.53,53.85,16.27,10.95,9.76,0,0.3,0.3,0.59,5.33,6.21,13.61,7.1,7.69,7.69,2.37,15.38,5.03,2.96,1.48,1.78,3.25,5.33,0.3,5.03,0.89,0.59,0.59,6.8,2.07,0,0,2.07,13.02,2.96,1.18,0.3,2.66,1.78,5.33,4.73,2.66,0.89,0.59,3.25,1.18,2.07,0,0,4.73,0.59,0.3,1.18,0.59,2.07,7.4,6.51,0.59,15.98,2.07,4.44,9.47,1.78,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.89,0.3,0.3,0,0,0,0,14.79,4.73,4.44,0.3,0.59,0.89,0,0,0.59,1.48,1.78,0
bb61it,NSFW: Diagnosed with PTSD. Root trauma from five years ago.,"I had a group of friends since 2004, and remained friends with them up until 2014 when I finally cut communications with them. They were a very toxic group of racist, sexist, and narcissistic people. The abuse all started in 2009 when I first entered college. I was on and off about them, but taking advice from other friends that no friends group always have easy times, I kept forgiving them. 

1. The ""leader"" is a cynical person who believes he can do no wrong and talks behind everyone's backs. He often shot down people when they were excited about a movie or an activity. For example, if I was excited about a new movie from a franchise coming out, he would go like ""You're not even a fan of this franchise, why are you so excited?"". On days where he was actually nice, he'd make this sinister condescending ""laugh"" like ""Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha."" I later found out he told everyone that I was clinically insane.
2. There's the leader's favorite, who was nice during one on one hangouts, but whenever the leader wass around, he berated me together with him. He would often write Facebook statuses tagging me, trying to shame me on social media over things he puts out of context, or things he completely made up. Whenever I confronted him about this, he'd seem apologetic and say it was a joke, only for him to do it again the next day. He would drop n-bombs in public, without any concern that people are listening to him.
3. There's the white supremecist (with only Asians being exempt), who does this thing where he calls you out over something innocuous you wrote on social media, and keeps egging you on until you get angry. He also attacked people that comment on my statuses. He would join in with the n-bombs with the leader's favorite.
4. There's the condescending smart guy, who's now a doctor, but he would be generally very verbally abuse and make statements like ""go kill yourself no one loves you""
5. There's the quiet guy, who makes absolutely no contribution to the group, yet everyone treated him with respect. He knew my relationship with the rest of the group, so one day when he found out I was dating someone he liked, he gave me the silent treatment and manipulated the situation where he got the rest of the group to bag on me. That was what made me finally leave.
6. The last was someone I considered my best friend, and had a fairly normal life. He was the only one I kept in more recent contact, but I noticed some of his personality traits were very similar to the group.  He would do the same mocking laugh the leader did, the same type of criticism that the leader's favorite and the white supremecist did. And at a recent party, I found out he was trying to hit on girlfriends of my friends, and made a lot of people uncomfortable. After realizing all this, I realized he is just as bad as that old group and I cut him off.

Over 5 years have passed since then, and I still think about this. I feel like I wasted so much of my potential and energy during college and feel this is part of why I'm struggling so much in the present. I think hanging out with the ""best friend"" in recent years triggered it even more, and I've been stuck in a rut for nearly a year since then.

I'm tired of my broken ass brain,"I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2014 after leaving an abusive relationship but to be honest I've had so much traumatic shit happen to me in my life I couldn't tell you the real culprit of my trauma. I was sexually abused by 2 of my cousins over the years, grew up watching my parents do drugs, beat the shit out of each other and beat me, was abused in a group home, abused by a doctor, found kiddy porn on my ex fiance's computer, watched my ex kill live animals to fuck with me, lost a baby... etc my life feels like a fucking horror movie looking back.. and now I'm having even more repressed memories or what I'm assuming is repressed memories resurface and I'm not even sure if they're real.. I just dont feel like so much different terrible events could happen to one person..  I feel insane. I know I have a lot of my life blocked out, childhood and parts of my life as an adult as well...and a lot of it I still remember that j wish I didn't. My PTSD symptoms died down a lot over the last couple years but my depression is resurfacing with a vengeance, I'm off my medication and dont have a therapist so now my PTSD symptoms are reviving. I haven't talked to literally anyone about it and have no way to see a professional anytime soon so its freaking me out. I refuse to bring these things up to friends and family because it's just too heavy and every time I do I break down and it's not pretty. I just dont want my mental health to ruin my life again. I've been trying not to think about it too hard but I can only ignore it for so long. I'm starting to have night terrors again and I'm becoming reclusive again. Certain things are bringing me intense anxiety all over again that I've gotten past before. 
I was at my girlfriend's house and she was doing dishes... and just the act of her doing dishes triggered me and that hasn't  happened in years. I had to go to the bathroom and calm down. I didn't have the heart to tell her anything. I didn't want her to feel like she did something wrong because she didn't and she doesnt know it's a trigger or even why. She doesnt know a lot of details. I dont even want to talk to her about all this stuff because her mental health is extremely vulnerable at the moment and I dont want to burden her with all this. But she really is my only form of support at the moment. I guess that's why I'm posting here. Maybe some random person will care enough to read this and give me some solid wise words.

bb95tb,Any firefighters/letter carriers(USPS)?,"I'm running into some issues now because of my job.  
Scroll back to 10 years ago, I am a firefighter, we get called to a fully involved house fire.  A child passed away inside.  I was one of 3 guys that carried the child out of the house.  It was a crappy day, but it never really ""bothered"" me. 
Fast forward to today.  I am now a letter carrier.  The home that the child passed away in, is on my route.  The home sat boarded up for almost 10 years.  It recently was foreclosed on, and the new owners fixed it up/rebuilt.  
Now I am delivering packages almost every day to this house, walking up the same steps that I carried this deceased child down.  
It's really starting to bother me.  A couple of days ago I had what I'd call a flash back that even the home owner was like ""woah buddy are you okay?"".  I was frozen on his steps.  I just said yeah, shrugged it off, but then puked at the next house.   
I've talked to guys in the fire house about it, they just say to go see someone- which I have and it's not really helping.  The doctor just wants to put me on meds that I'm sure are pretty much going to sedate me (he mentioned Klonopin).  I don't have an issue except when I have to walk up to the door.  
Really not sure what to do at this point.  I just wish I didn't have to deliver to his house.  Already mentioned something to my supervisor about it, he just said it's on your route nothing I can do, call the EAP(telephone system for counseling).",bmwgsrider68,2019-04-09 08:18:13,3,290,56.62,41.81,97.46,31.66,13.18,11.38,93.1,59.66,19.31,11.38,8.62,0.34,0.69,1.38,0.34,7.93,7.24,15.52,9.66,7.93,2.41,2.07,16.9,1.72,1.03,1.38,1.38,1.72,3.1,1.72,1.38,0,1.03,0,11.38,0,1.03,0,2.41,8.62,0,0.34,0.69,2.41,1.72,3.45,2.76,0.34,1.38,1.03,0.69,0,0.69,0,0,5.52,0.69,0,4.48,0.34,0,6.55,10.34,1.38,22.76,6.55,9.66,8.28,1.38,0.34,3.45,0,0,0.34,1.38,0.34,0,0.69,0,0.34,19.31,7.24,3.79,0,0,0.69,0,0.34,1.38,3.1,2.07,0.69
bba2zv,PTSD from relationship?,"I recently had a horrible breakup and am still reeling from it. The relationship was full of turmoil and chaos and what I’ve now come to realize as like...emotional torture. In the end I was cheated on and discarded and feel absolutely ruined. I can barely get out of bed in the morning, choosing instead to lay there numbly under the covers. I cry myself to sleep and at night my ex infiltrates my dreams. In the day time I’m plagued by what I can only describe as intrusive or obsessive thoughts. I don’t want to think of things but they keep popping into my head. My heart constantly feels heavy like it’s sinking. I feel like I will never ever trust or date again. I can’t even look people in the eye anymore, which is something my psychiatrist pointed out. 

I was put on prozac which I started Saturday morning and it’s only been a few days so obviously I don’t notice a difference. 

Could I be traumatized by the mental abuse and subsequent breakup? I feel like I’m dying. No advice from my therapist seems to help and I’ve been doing all the “homework” she gives me

bbci42,feeling like a husk of a husk,"i've been technically homeless since late january.
we were evicted because the homeowner wanted to renovations and didnt give us much notice to have time too for a place (last time it took 5 months to find one, our city and country is in a housing crisis).

i stated in motels then a hostel with my mom and younger brother (16, im 23) and now we are in a temp house with the salvation army which is nicer, but the neighbours stomp around upstairs, yell and are generally loud while saying us making average noise eg. talking, my brother sings but not loud at all. the walls are just thin. the neighbour came to our door a few times and was aggressive about us making average living sounds, saying he'll get us kicked out. he can't though, the police have him on a file etc and hes been talked to by his landlord and sa.

my mum is emotionally abusive and has been for years, ever since we were evicted my health has rapidly declined and i had to ask my siblings if i could stay with them for a bit because i wanted to die so bad. 

wasnt able to stay long and am back with my mum and brother. thinking back to early-mid january i was happier and even thought about getting a part time job. i could relax and do stuff.

now i feel kind of empty and losing stability. i dont know... i just feel dissolved and guilt is killing me. i can barely deal with things. my mum yells at me or gets angry regularly. a lot of things to explain. its just not good i dont feel good she commented that i age regress ... what do you think is the cause of that?? 

she doesnt take responsibility for the things she does ive tried for months to get into my own place but havent been successful yet...

bbcl3q,PTSD after a car accident?,"I'm sure this gets posted a lot and I'm certain that this is nothing as extreme in comparison to the typical situations on here, but here it goes: 

I own a business that requires I drive anywhere from 50 to 150 miles a day. I spend quite a bit of time on the road.  Well around a year and a half ago I had a car cross over a double yellow right into me head on. I have a decent sized truck, they were in a small compact car. My truck was repaired from the accident and returned to me.

Flash forward about two months later, I'm driving home from work and the wheel comes off my truck. Turns out when they were putting everything back together from the accident they didn't attach a part tightly enough (the carrier bolt on upper control arm for you car people).

They fixed it, but ever since then I haven't been able the drive the same. I've taken my truck into the shop once a month for every small noise and rattle for the last year and a half. I've had the suspension rebuilt twice. Had my truck checked by a dozen mechanics, all telling me it looks pristine. But once I get on the highway I always am going at least 10-15 under the speed limit, white knuckle driving. 

I don't fear other cars on the road, or even my truck specifically, just whatever car I'm driving. I've driven at least 40,000 miles a year for the last decade, but now I feel like I can't trust whatever car I drive.",GHOSTLYHUMAN,2019-04-09 13:00:52,4,276,77.21,13.85,99,52.99,18.4,13.04,86.96,53.26,15.58,11.59,9.78,0,0.36,0,1.45,3.99,11.23,12.68,7.25,4.71,5.07,1.81,11.59,4.71,2.9,1.09,5.07,2.9,2.17,1.81,0.36,0.36,0,0,3.62,0,0,0,0,8.7,0.36,0.72,0,1.45,3.26,3.26,2.17,1.09,0.36,0.72,1.09,1.09,0,0,0,5.43,0.36,1.45,2.17,1.09,0.36,3.99,8.7,0.72,25.72,7.25,10.51,9.06,1.09,0.36,0.36,1.09,0,0,0.36,0,0,0,0.36,0,14.49,5.07,3.62,0.36,0,0.36,0,0.36,0,3.99,0.72,0

In my English class I am currently writing a 2-part project on a problem/solution to a problem in my community (Denver).  I chose to write about the local VA hospital that went over budget and cut the PTSD care facility in order to complete the project.  

I see this as a problem, especially knowing veterans that suffer from PTSD.  I know of people that are leaving the state to get the care that they feel they need because the VA is unable to give them the care they deserve.  Denver is also looking into making medical grade magic mushrooms and medical grade MDMA legal for treatment of depression and symptoms of PTSD.  

This survey is only asking for some bits of information as well as your opinion on new experimental treatments that are on the rise.  Please do me a favor and help me complete this project.  I appreciate anybody and everybody taking the time to read this.  Thanks!

bbf05r,Uncomfortable with PDA?,"Hi,

I'm wanting to ask for some advice if that's okay! 

I'm not formally diagnosed with PTSD, but I'm getting EMDR for what happened. So the background situation is that I grew up with my stepdad and my mum since I was 12. When I was 17, he (who was 32 at the time) made sexual advances and since then, I'd been abused until I was 21. I finally left the situation when I was 21 and I just turned 23. He told me that he only loves me and not my mum, and he's always been very good with children. We were extremely close and I wasn't really close to my mum. 

My mum had been abused as a child, and I suspect she has borderline personality disorder because of the way that she treat me (it's very toxic and a lot of emotional blackmailing, and blaming me for what happened, then she'll say ""Oh but I really love you,no matter what"", then she'll revert back to ""but why did you betray me? I don't care that he did, but you're my daughter, how could you do that to me??""). 

So whilst the abuse was going on, in hindsight, I think she knew deep down but didn't want to confront anyone. She'd be very lovey dovey with my stepdad, and put her head on him when we're watching something. Say things like ""You mean nothing to him without me. I'm the one that he'll be with forever"". It's just a lot of public displays of affection, and I felt very uncomfortable, very left out and very hurt but I obviously couldn't say anything. 

Now, I'm in a relationship (long distance so I don't see him as much as I'd like) and my housemate recently got a girlfriend (it's his first relationship) and there's been a lot of just them cuddling, kissing, putting his hand around her waist, her stroking his cheek or something. And it's making me extremely uncomfortable. It *hurts* me, to see/hear any of this. But I can't say anything because it's his first relationship, he's having a hard time with everything else that's going on and he feels that his relationship is the only good thing going on right now. 

And I understand, that it's not even about them. This happens with any couple that I see around me, and I don't think it'll be a tonne better even if my boyfriend did live in the same city (we see each other once a month or so) because it's not about him either. I'm happy with him, I'm happy for my housemate, but everytime I see or hear them together, it hurts inside. It happens with other couples, but not as strongly because she's around a lot now so they're sort of ""in my face' a lot. I'm happy for them, I really am, but it also really hurts. Even though I know, it's not about *them* at all. 

It feels less painful when I'm also being cute with my boyfriend, but not a whole lot. I just feel kind of uncomfortable and it feels like a competition of ""who's a better couple?"". 

Sorry that this is so long, I'm just having a lot of trouble processing this. I'd tried to visualise it in the EMDR way, but, it still hurts. Maybe I need to do a proper session on just that but in the mean time I'm just asking for some advice :(

bbfmxy,Anxiety attack talking about colors?,"To start off my question, I was diagnosed after I had an extremely bad trip on LSD. Today at work ,(everyone is aware of the incident, but doesn’t know about my mental issues caused by it) one of my coworkers got talking about how he is colorblind. Somehow that led into a discussion on how everyone sees colors differently. He kept trying to “blow my mind” with different weird facts about the brain, colors, and various other things. 
After the whole discussion I had a few moments where absolutely nothing seemed real, and my coworkers could tell I was distressed but I think I managed to play it off pretty well.

bbgsba,is it sexual assault? trigger warning,"My PTSD symptoms are usually under control now, but I had an experience that caused me to have severe flashbacks yesterday.  I was in places in my memory I normally don't go.  I had some bad re-experiencing of my ex husband having sex with me.  He would do it without any foreplay or anything, like, it, was a very straightforward act of physical domination, it wasn't a loving thing.  But I wouldn't fight him or try to stop him because he would do it right near where our young children were sleeping.  I was afraid if I fought him at all he would do something to wake them up, or he would hurt me enough that I would cry out and wake them up, and then they would come out and see me like that.  I didn't want them to hear anything like that or see anything like that.

Re-experiencing that, feeling that dead feeling like that, that helplessness... I never talked to anyone about any of that.  (I did get an order of protection based on other things he did).  I don't know what to call that sex part of it.  I didn't get physically hurt.  I didn't actively resist- though I did ask him to stop doing that to me, and he would laugh at me, and he didn't stop.  I just went dead and I could tell that was what he enjoyed about it.  We hadn't done anything a person could call normal sex or lovemaking in a long time, by that point.  He wasn't interested in that sort of thing anymore.

bbhyrs,Army Veteran,"Hey reddit! Not sure how to start because this is my first time here, so I'll do my best!
I joined the army in 2006. I loved every minute I was training, whether it was sandbags or live fire drills. It was my dream come true. I was deployed to Afghanistan in early 2008. Surprisingly I didn't see any action. Patrols were boring and arduous, training every day in the blistering heat just waiting to be shot at any moment. But nothing happened even remotely combat related.
Until one day in January 2009, as I walked out of my barracks to get water from the barrel.... *CRACK* I was knocked to the ground by a sniper. He'd hit me directly in my plate carrier and the bullet impacted so hard I couldn't see because I was in so much pain. I've never had the wind knocked out of me so badly.
A patrol was sent to find the sniper some hours later and he was located in a village not more than 300 meters away. Why he didn't move, I have no clue. 
But after him, we had tightened our security and heightened our walls. We were all good from there. About 5 or 6 days later we were sent out on a cav patrol. A friendly humvee was hit by an IED and was taking fire. There were 2 soldiers still trapped inside because one side had been hit by the IED and the doors didn't open and the other was in direct line of enemy fire. As we rolled up, the firing stopped, so we assumed the insurgents had fled due to our superior firepower.
After about 20 seconds of silence, I get out of the humvee and bum rush over to the friendly humvee that was hit. There were 2 or 3 soldiers taking cover behind the humvee with me and the other 2 guys were still trapped inside, the soldiers from the humvee that had run over the IED were evacuated back to the cavalry. So as I scramble around to open up the doors and let the soldiers out, an RPG hit the engine bay and sent a massive fireball through the cab of the humvee. I opened the door and both soldiers were engulfed in flames.
We pulled one out and managed to put him out before he sustained life threatening injuries but the other soldier, we'll call him ""jack"" was jammed in the rear of the humvee, burning alive. I still remember him screaming for his mother. 
But then all of a sudden the whole humvee explodes, I remember waking up and I was sitting in a crossed legged position. I stood to my feet and then realised I had medics screaming at my face to stay still! Stay still! 
It turned out that a piece of shrapnel had gone through my pelvis and taken my testicle with it. Sure it might sound far fetched, but everything I'm telling you is absolutely true. 
From there I was discharged. Sent home to live the life of a ""normal citizen"". I dreamed of ""jack"" screaming for his mother every night. Some nights I'd wake up so upset I would vomit, or I'd fumble for my rifle as if I'm still on the battlefield.
6 years pass and in 2015 I had been diagnosed with PTSD. 
From there began a great depression. I started drinking, isolating myself, just being antisocial in general. Then I'm told I can't have children. Which was the final straw. I had decided to take my own life. 
I originally thought of just simply shooting myself. Quick, efficient, effective. But messy and a burden on everyone involved. So I decided I'd just hang myself. But who knew there were so many options and methods??? 
The main ones are 
Long drop: pirates of the Caribbean style
Short drop: stepping off a milk crate or a stool
Dead weight method: tying a noose around your neck and bending your knees until you eventually pass out and gravity does the rest. 
I did extensive research and I found, the long drop to be most effective, quick and painless way. Although many more things can go wrong. For example, your head will come off if you dont do your math first. Or you can instead of breaking your spinal cord and dying, you could break your spinal cord and live as a vegetable. 
No thank you.
Short drop, same deal, but slightly more room for error. 
But dead weight is supposed to be completely pain free and still very quick. Relatively nothing can go wrong. 
So I book a hotel room, buy some plastic sheets because i hate making things hard for people. This way they just need to load up my body and roll up the plastic. So I remove the linen from the bed and lay the plastic sheets down. I make a call for room service in 1 hour then I stick a note to the front door saying basically ""call the police, I'm dead"". And then deadbolt the door closed. 
As I'm standing there with a rope around my neck, I expected life to flash before my eyes. But my mind drew a blank. 3....2....1.... I slowly bend my knees until I feel the pressure building inside my head. 
I can actually remember everything I saw, smelled and tasted. Yes. Tasted.
After probably 15-20 seconds, I knew I was unconscious. At first I felt high. I was all tingly and numb. It felt good. Then I started seeing bright flashes and spots, colorful sparks and a gentle humming sound in my ears.
And I know it's weird, and I'm slightly embarrassed by this, but I actually felt like I had a full body orgasm. Just writing it is weird for me. But anyway. That's where the good part ends. 
I started hearing MASSIVE pops and bangs in my head. My brain had gone into self preservation mode and forced me to become semi conscious again. The pain was unbearable. My head felt like it was being slowly split open from the inside, my eyes felt like they were being squeezed and all I could see was red (the blood vessels in my eyes popped)
At that point my heart was racing so fast and hard I could feel it. It felt like my head was being repeatedly stomped on. But the scariest part was, no matter how much I tried to stand up, I had no control over my body. I was seizing up and wriggling around. Almost as if I was possessed. Trapped inside my own head. I'd say this was about 50 seconds to a minute in. Although it felt like hours. 
I've never in my entire life felt such intense pain and fear. All I wanted was to live at this point. 
Then, I passed out again. I was self aware and I knew I was probably dead at this point. I was in a black room. I heard my own voice surrounding me. It was telling me I made the wrong decision and I still have a choice and not to stop fighting. I thought about it for a while it felt like. But it was probably seconds. 
The words ""don't stop fighting!"" Kept repeating and repeating, until suddenly I became completely conscious. I remember grabbing the rope and using all the strength I had left to pull down. The ceiling fan let go and I dropped to the floor. I don't remember how I got the rope off and i don't remember anybody finding me. I woke up in a hospital bed some time later. I had a chipped upper vertebra and a slipped disk in my spine. My neck was in a brace and my face was swollen as if I'd been stung by a thousand bees. I had the worst headache and what can only be compared to motion sickness. I was in agony for days. I can definitely say I'd rather take another few shots to the guts over going through that pain again. 
I just turned 37 on the 7th of April. I have 3 kids, 2 boys and a beautiful daughter against all odds. I met the love of my life at my highschool reunion. Although I have a permanent speech impairment and i sleep funny. Luckily I didn't sustain permanent brain damage. 
The one thing that still pisses me off is that I spent $300 on plastic sheets and those bastards never gave them back.",Sir-JohnDoe,2019-04-09 21:46:02,7,1429,50.28,21.86,97.24,13.46,12.43,14.98,87.19,55.28,15.68,12.53,10.08,0.7,0.84,0.7,0.21,3.15,6.86,12.67,9.1,5.6,8.47,1.54,17.28,4.62,2.24,0.63,2.24,2.24,4.34,1.61,2.52,0.42,0.56,0.21,5.67,0.21,0.21,0.21,0.84,10.71,2.87,1.12,0.91,1.89,1.96,3.22,4.06,0.91,0.98,1.96,4.9,2.45,1.82,0.07,0.56,5.74,1.19,0.42,2.73,0.91,0.7,8.96,5.46,0.98,17.98,2.87,9.31,6.23,0.63,0.42,0.84,0.21,0,0.42,0.49,0.14,0.07,0.14,0,0.07,15.05,8.4,2.8,0.21,0,0.21,0.35,0.07,0.7,1.96,0.14,0.21

bbizqh,[Vent] I am starting to not like..,"This is going to be all over the place. I dont want to spend too much time editing it : 

Background: 
My cousin molested me when I was younger. I repressed all those memories. When I got my first (and current) bf they came back.  Years past and I was okay. Recently Its effecting my life again 


Now: 

I am starting to not like many forms of contact with bf.  

I recently realized this and its making me not wanna see my bf at all anymore on top of other reasons. 

 Hes naturally touchy in general so its a problem. It wasnt rly a big deal before because I loved hugging and being close.


 I already told him how I feel about me not wanting to be touched anymore. i havent seen him yet tho but yeah. He respects it. He wants to protect me. 

Whenever I see him I just hug him and than we walk. But he tries to put his arm around me and I got so defensive. ""why did u do that. Seriously?  Why. Stop touching me!"". And before I would hang on him and let him pick me up. 

I realized its cuz I been thinking too much of something that happend to me. And its been bothering me so bad. I became scared of him randomly but I just figured I will get over it. But than I started to become defensive whenever I feel uncomfrotable. I am gonna control myself better since I realized what I am doing. Plus I told him not to do that without asking


After 30 minutes of being with him I am able to hug him longer and stuff.

I just feel bad cuz last time he was like "" you havent kissed me once ahaha 😓"" and i waz like oh! Sorry. *peck on cheek* and he said I didnt have to and stuff cuz he felt bad I felt bad 

I just feel bad still. I didnt even notice. I always kissed him when I first see him. I didnt even kiss him on lips....The cheek?!  Like he likes it still but. I just. Hate it? Hate how I am like now. It was already bad enough I didnt like kissing for too long. I actually dont like making out tbh! I used to cry but now I feel nothing. I only like peck kisses. Which is 90% percent of our kisses lolol. Rest I do it cuz ik he likes it. 

I dunno. What made it worse was when he was joking with me. And he acted like a different person and was pretending to not let me pass him. I freaked out so bad internally. I felt like it wasnt him and I made him stop. 

Than before that. We were doin stuff....and he made me ""finish"" for the first time. And I had this horrible feeling after. And it made me scared I forgot something and was gonna remember it. Cuz i know I forgot many things. 

This one memory I am never over. Cuz I dunno what happend after: 

I was in bathroom with cousin for some reason. I think he followed me in there. And than he was talking to me and I freaked out and ran to the door and he grabbed my arm when I was close. And he begged me not to leave and he promised me a gift. I said okay. And than he took me back to the back of bathroom and than memory stops. 

I just dunno what he made me do. And its scary. 


I dunno. 


I also have memories of me naked and in bed and all. I dunno why I was naked. 

I also dunno if I had sex or not with him. I never wanna have sex again cuz I dunno if i will remember anything. It sucks. 

Only way Ik i will be willing to. Is if I pretend I am not there and let him do that. Last time and first time it happend I went numb and was gone. I felt bad cuz he told me I can tell him to stop. But i seriously feel why bother cuz i prob will never like sex. I dunno. Iseriously feel that anything sexual. I shouldnt like. And if i dont like it it doesnt matter as long as I dont cry or feel like pushing him away. 

I dunno. 

I just want to be how I was before. Literally like last month I was a bit normal.  Hugging. Kissing. Laughing. Cuddles.

bbjpcf,Trauma recovery begins with survival.,"TL DR: how do you overcome being completely powerless and helpless at the hands of others? (I wasn’t raped). 
——
I wanted to share that quote because it rings true for me and maybe you. 

I’ve been surviving for 6 years. I wasn’t raped or anything like that, I can’t imagine what that would be like and I’m not going to offer fake words because that’s not helpful to those who have been through that. 

My trauma involved something less sinister but still life changing. 

At the point of my mental breakdown the two people I loved the most in my life abandoned me. My boyfriend was angry that I left him to go home to my mum. He had worn me down - I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. Then my mum got angry at my boyfriend and forced me to cut contact with him. They both wanted me to do different things and In the end they both hurt me, leaving me alone and terrified with no support from either. 

I survived for about 3 years, trying desperately to find a safe place where I could retreat, but it made me repress all my emotions just to keep going. My anxiety was relentless but I had no one to support me. 

When it all finally fell apart I went into total meltdown. I couldn’t think I could cope with anything. I was so depressed it just was the loneliest emptiest time of my life. 

Now I have ptsd of that time in my life. A secondary trauma. I went back on meds and got a job. I went into functioning and pushing away my feelings. But now I’m off meds again. 

I know that I’m extremely dissociated and have lost myself. I cry in the shower and bash my head against the cold tiles to try and wake my brain up. 

It occurred to me tonight that at the heart of my trauma two words come to mind. Powerless and helpless. In the time i needed the most support in my life - during a breakdown, I was hurt so deeply that I was forced into surviving. 

It was like I had broken my legs and then had to run a marathon on broken legs. That’s how it’s been. 

I don’t want to survive. It’s so unfair to see people living their lives, having holidays and babies and getting married. 

I often shake my head in disbelief that this happened to me. I never imagined my life could fall apart so much. 

How much longer will my family care about me when I have so much anger to them. Then I really will be alone. 

So I ask you all, how do you face and try to accept and heal from feeling totally and utterly helpless at the hands of someone else? How do you stop thinking about how things could have been if you hadn’t felt so torn and afraid?

I know it sounds like a simple thing - but it truly has been hell. I don’t feel like I have a home. I feel like the mum I used to love hurt me and I now don’t have her anymore. My world looks so unfamiliar and uncomfortable. I go to work and come home and go to sleep. That’s all I do. 

I just feel like this should never have happened to me. This wasn’t my choice. 

I’m doing yoga again, have been taking a number of herbs. I bought some cbd oil but that’s triggered a lot of deep unsettling memories and I have no idea what I’m supposed to do with them.

bbkbys,How do I get this stupid intrusive memory out of my head,"I should preface this with I don’t have a formal diagnosis, and I know self diagnosis is annoying as hell and I’m sorry. But my mom was really abusive to me growing up which might’ve given me some kind of CPTSD type thing, and then I had a horrible miscarriage almost a year ago (found out I was pregnant a year ago today actually) that I think might’ve given me regular PTSD? Oh and my mom was super insensitive about the miscarriage recently (you can look in my post history if you’d like) and that kind of twisted the knife I guess. 

The night it happened (at least I think, it was a missed miscarriage so I didn’t bleed or expel anything, but I went to the doctor the next day and my pregnancy hormone levels had gone down) I went from feeling completely fine to being violently ill within minutes. I was basically projectile vomiting and completely terrified. And I have...it’s not a flashback because I don’t literally think I’m there...but this really distressing, intrusive, vivid recurring memory of half sitting half lying on the bathroom floor while it was happening. Specifically the feeling of the tiles on my skin. Like...cold and hard. The most random thing ever but I can just FEEL it and it’s freaking me out. It’s been popping up over and over and over again. For days. I try to replace it with happy thoughts or better memories and that hasn’t been working too well. 

Again I’m really sorry I don’t have a formal diagnosis but one of my friends who has bad PTSD said it sounds like it. I know someone suggested EMDR and I’m looking for a therapist but am in the process of moving from Canada to the US so can’t really start until I move in late June.

bbl2j8,My 3 immediate family members died this past year.,"Hi guys. 
I recently lost my grandmother, mother, and aunt all within a year. (Aug 2017 - Sept. 2018)  Back to back. When my mother was ill i had to make the decision to take her off life support by myself.. my aunt and grandmother were put on hospice so I had prepared for them.
 My mother went to the hospital with what we thought was the stomach flu and ended up only living 28 days after that. It came out of no where. We were all extremely close and I still cant level out.  
I am a 20 year old female. The only immediate family I have left is my father. My other grandparents passed away when I was younger. 

I have socially isolated myself the past 4 years due to being in a controlling relationship.. 
Prior to their deaths I was going to therapy for childhood trauma &amp; bad psychosis. I have not been since because of insurance issues, etc.  I should mention several family memebers had suffered from schizophrenia.
I suffer from auditory hallucinations &amp; apophenia or paranoia so to speak. (3 years ago I had a very weird situation happen with some people and they fucked my mind up to the point where It brought out the hallucinations. I did NOT have them before.)   That is enough to drive me mad in itself at times. It's made me think that anyone who goes out of their way to befriend me is out to get me. And that ""I need not complain about anything because its insignificant. This is life right?"" 


I have experienced lots of friends and distant relatives deaths before and even grew up with family owning funeral home. I was never sheltered from anything.
When I was a kid, an adult I was staying the weekend with died while I was there and  I never got any explanation for it, I spent majority of my childhood thinking it was somehow my fault.
 I am not a religious person. 
I's hard to find comfort in anything at this point. It has manifested into a constant fear that If i get close to someone they will eventually die. My brain loops that it's a possibility the decisions I make could cause a butterfly effect that could result in that. 
I'm really tired of being isolated. I have things I want to achieve but I find myself seeking validation and lowering my standards more than ever now and i want to have the  confidence in myself to not need that. 
I NEED to have a normal social life again for my sanity. And not feel guilty about it. 
I dont know exactly what I'm looking for, 
I will take any advice. Just putting this out here is a big step for me!

bbl2m7,Ptsd?,"TW death of pets. 

Is it possible to have ptsd after the loss of a pet? Has anyone else experienced this? 

I watched my dog rapidly deteriorate from happy and healthy to unable to walk, disturbed breathing and unable to toilet within 48 hrs. I stayed up all night with him the second night as he could not sleep and I didn’t either. I also held him as he passed the next day. He was euthanised and it was the most traumatic experience I have ever had. 

This was over 12 months ago and I have nightmares every night that he is sick and cannot walk and I can’t help him. Every time I think of those 2 days I break down in tears and I feel absolutely heartbroken, guilty and awful. Intrusive images of him pop into my head every few days and since I am doing a nursing degree, when we talk about death, dying, end of life, etc. again those images come back to me and I break down. 

Does this sound like normal grief or ptsd? I cannot physically talk about it because my throat seizes up whenever I think about it and I can’t speak. Hoping you guys can help me work it out.

bbm257,How do I get rid of fear of death and get motivated to do something and enjoy life?,"I am in the final month of my Academic research job. I was already burnt out from work stress a year ago and mildly depressed. Then in a colleague's birthday party I too some recreational drugs for first time in my life (space cake or mushroom IDK). I am 33 by the way. At first I did not feel any different and kept on drinking beer. But after few hour my body started to sweat and my heartbeat increased. I felt like unable to breath. I started to panic and ask my friends to call for ambulance and they kept trying to calm me down telling me it will go away, don't panic. But my heartbeat increased to the point where its gonna burst, I became so sure I am going to die that day. I asked my friend to tell my parents that I loved them and that I am sorry that I tried drug, also I felt immense regret that I just married six month ago to a nice beautiful girl and couldn't got the chance to spent enough time with her as we live in different cities. Then I literary felt my last breath out and felt my heart stop and I fell to the floor slowly while my friends were trying to pull me up. There were no feeling at that moment, it was not at all like a sleep. I did not hear anything, feel anything, no pain. It is hard to explain the actual feeling as I did not exist for that time, I was dead (or as you call it passed out). I don't know how long I was dead, I opened my eyes for few seconds and then felt OMG, I am not dead, but again passed out for 2nd time... and this continued many time till morning. I felt immensely bad as my colleague had to sleep on sofa as I was on his bed. I said sorry many times and came back to my apartment. 

That incident changed me forever. I was burnt out already and now I am depressed as I see that when I die, I won't  float and slowly move to the heaven (or hell) as I always imagined. There is no 'soul' which can live without the body. When I die I simply do not EXIST.  When I die, I won't be able to carry or keep these love, compassion, relationships and caring I have acquired throughout my life. This remembrance that I have everyday make me utterly sad or depressed. Until that incident I never worried or think about death. I always stayed happy no matter what, enjoying ups and downs of everyday life. But now I feel there is no point doing anything in life. So, I feel no joy in my work. I haven't searched for for next job even if it is my last month at work. I have no motivation to do anything (watch movie, eat something nice, help someone out). I already feel like I am dead person without any emotion. Why bother doing anything, I aint gonna take it with me when I die. My job performance has decreased significantly, as I barely work. I am still in my work because its a university and my boss can't fire me for my sickness. I stopped caring about my work. I know the consequence of not being productive is bad for career but I can't help to ignore everything and just keep worrying or thinking about horrible future (having no job) and ultimately death.

  My married life is also affected due to my situation. We are married for just two years but we barely have sex or romantic intimacy. My wife probably would leave me or she would be depressed. From her behavior and mood I think she is already depressed. She used to talk a lot and always smile and cheer me up. Now she is always have the look of being lost having a blank stare at the walls. I feel I have lost control of my life and I won't feel happy again.",yesilovethis,2019-04-10 06:32:25,1,704,19.57,6.26,99,17.51,16,13.49,96.16,58.38,20.31,15.34,13.49,0.43,0.14,0.99,0.28,4.97,2.56,12.64,8.66,5.68,9.38,4.12,19.18,4.26,1.99,1.42,0.71,1.28,6.53,2.84,3.41,0.99,0.28,1.56,6.25,0.71,0.71,1.14,0.14,14.2,3.55,1.85,0.71,3.98,1.56,4.4,4.12,0.99,0.28,2.84,4.12,1.28,1.85,0.14,0.57,7.53,2.98,2.56,0.99,0.71,0.71,6.68,11.93,1.56,16.62,2.7,5.11,9.38,2.98,0.71,0.43,0.14,0.43,1.85,0.71,0.14,0.57,0,0,0.14,12.5,6.39,2.84,0,0,0.14,0,0,0,1.7,1.42,0

Does the son like overtake the father?
Why’s no one love me?
Is my mother suffering from my smoking?
Has god ever made a mistake?

I have like powers and shit and am tormented by spits. Once it was like someone dropped a toaster in the bathtub with me in it. I play around with my body like I’ve lived in individual parts of my head screaming. I’ve even felt orange juice screamed and been called Christ

I’ve witnessed horror beyond belief for example

A talking head resting on a pike and a man puking in a bathtub with like grinders on his back I can feel it happening to me

Help,"I'm a 22 yr old female and I have PTSD which causes me to have horrible terrifying night terrors so my dl psychiatrist put me on minipress to stop the nightmares and it worked. But Everytime I go to my primary doctor he lectures me on how I'm on too many meds (I am also bipolar, borderline and have paralyzing anxiety) so I thought I'd tell my psychiatrist to stop the minipress about a week ago so he said ok but he did ask me what I'd do if the terrors came back. Well I said I'm in therapy now so I should be able to handle it and also I wanted to please my primary. Well the night terrors cause me to be stuck in the nightmare and it's impossible to wake up and now I started to wet the bed. I'm so embarrassed this never happened to me before. I see my psychiatrist in a few days and I'm scared to tell him I need to go back on minipress and I was wrong and now I'm bed wetting. Should I be scared to tell him?

bbojt6,How do you know for sure if you have ptsd?,"Since I’ve gone no contact with my (now 5 years sober) alcoholic mother I’ve been having terrible nightmares that have me waking up so upset, often ruining my mornings and rendering me incapable of being functional until later in the day. They’re always about my mom being black out drunk, memories that are warped and twisted, me fighting for my life or trying to escape from someone trying to capture me or shoot me. They’re always about or revolve around my mom and my past. It’s terrifying and I never thought I had ptsd (I always minimize things bc I hate to seem dramatic or like I’m looking for attention) but I seem to have all the symptoms and it’s becoming debilitating. Every day I wake up feeling guilty &amp; ashamed for trying to reclaim my life and find out who I am without my mothers validation or love but it’s so difficult and exhausting. Life seems futile at the moment and it’s hard to feel motivated to do anything. I’m currently on a mood stabilizer but am seeing my psychiatrist next week to tell her about this and perhaps go on another med, but I really don’t want to seem dramatic or like I am making a mountain out of a molehill. I see a therapist and do group therapy centred around DBT skills weekly. 
I know people have it way worse than me and I don’t feel worthy of help or care most of the time. Are flashbacks also considered nightmares or are they a separate thing altogether? How do you know for sure if you even have ptsd?

I don't have close relationships with anyone and I can't hold a steady relationship with a boyfriend. It's embarrassing but I know I gotta own who I am so I express how open and honest I am and nothing holds me back but what everyone doesn't know.....

bbsc4e,My flashbacks feel like I'm being possessed. (Trigger Warning for firearms),"They only really occur at night and only started 6 months ago. It feels like I lose control both mentally and physically. I see one of two visions both involving injury to the back of my head. The crunching sound I hear keeps me awake for hours. That's not even what concerns me the most honestly.. Physically my body feels like it weighs far more than normal, almost as if gravity has been increased, and I lay flat on the ground like I had just fallen from the clouds. This repeats as if it were hiccups,  hitting me and paralyzing me for 5 seconds and then i feel in control for about 20 seconds I have to really focus to make them go away. The shivering that occurs after the attacks last 20 minutes or so, but they dont occur due to the cold, only fear. I have struggled with depression for years but this is far beyond any mental illness I've encountered. Nothing about it feels ""only in my head"". I hear the gun shot, I see the flash, and feel the crunch of the back of my head cave in. My body jolts like it's been struck and I feel the pain, though I have never known it in reality. they feel more like seizures rather than flash backs. The paranoia never leaves. I say flashback because the term visions seems superstitious considering what I'm about to say. I haven't been shot. My head has been hit a few times but nothing serious. if this isnt the past I see, something tells my brain it could be the future and I'm always on edge.

I will spent up to 3 hours there, spending 95% of my time petting kitties. Today one cat, who is in isolation and is terrified of all people, finally let me pet her. She licked and rubbed up against me. I feel like I've actually accomplished something since I've been on break. I've made a small difference to that cat with my compassion and patience.

&amp;#x200B;

It is just a trigger-free space for me. Most of the time I am alone with the cats, and only sometimes am I joined by little kids. It is really wonderful, and I would recommend it to all of you. It is like a little break from the past. It is a place where I can be present in life without being in pain.",AbsurdPigment,2019-04-10 16:09:06,2,227,59.39,29.84,92.2,41.71,12.61,14.54,91.19,59.03,19.38,11.89,10.57,0,0.44,0.88,0,7.49,5.29,16.74,12.33,3.08,3.96,0.88,19.38,5.29,3.52,1.32,1.76,1.76,6.17,3.52,2.64,0.44,0,1.32,8.81,0,0,0.88,0,11.01,1.76,1.32,0.88,2.64,1.32,3.08,1.76,0,0,1.32,1.32,0,1.32,0,0,8.37,2.64,2.64,1.32,2.2,0,4.41,13.66,0.44,15.86,0.88,8.37,5.73,1.76,0.44,0.44,1.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20.26,7.49,4.41,0,2.64,0,0,0.44,0,2.2,0,3.08
bbstau,Advice on family members who are triggers,"Incredibly brief background: I have Asperger's and experienced emotional trauma from my childhood and upbringing.

I'm in a bit of a difficult situation at the moment. I have recently begun talking to my family again over email after avoiding contact for a year as I needed to distance myself from them. I have a great deal of trauma attached to my birth name which I no longer use and they put very little effort into understanding this and not using it when talking to or about me. I also have trauma associated with my upbringing and my family's behaviour to me as a child.

The conversations were over email and it felt as if they had begun to be more understanding of this. Recently my Mother came to visit me and after about an hour into her being here, I noticed I had begun to feel extremely nauseous, very anxious and uncomfortable, to the point where I really struggled to focus and maintain socialising for the rest of the day and for the rest of her visit. I had a really hard time falling asleep because these feelings did not subside and instead had gotten worse, leaving me up overthinking to the point of crying and feeling like I needed to throw up as if I had something stuck in my throat.

Even though they have not purposefully me any wrongdoing and that I still love them as family, I feel as if I would be putting myself through more than it is worth and more than I can deal with if I continued keeping in contact with them. I feel great deals of guilt when considering cutting them out of my life but I honestly don't know if there is a better option at this point other than doing this and seeing a therapist.

People say that you are meant to remove from your life things that are triggering for past trauma, but what do you do when this trigger is a person, especially a family member or members?

I am really stuck here, sometimes I feel as if I am being over sensitive and nasty about this, but other times I feel justified and this is the right thing to do for myself.  I can't tell if I am being unreasonable/unfair or not and would really appreciate a second opinion on this.",TooManyHappy,2019-04-10 16:10:50,1,402,36.93,17.86,97.77,2.93,28.71,15.92,94.78,63.68,19.15,13.43,10.45,0,0.75,0.5,1.74,5.72,4.98,16.17,8.96,5.97,10.95,1.74,16.17,7.21,5.22,1.74,0.25,1.24,5.47,1.49,3.98,1.24,0.25,0.25,9.45,1.24,0.5,0.75,0,15.67,3.98,1.99,2.74,3.73,0.5,7.21,2.99,0.25,0.25,2.24,1.74,0.5,1,0,0,6.22,2.24,0.75,1.74,1,0.75,4.23,8.71,0,14.68,2.74,6.22,5.97,0.5,1,1,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.21,2.99,2.24,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,0,1.24,0,0.25

bbyd8q,Trying to stop sleep meds after two years of using them,"Hi!

I was wondering if other had experiences or tips to share on stopping using sleep meds. I have PTSD and anxiety disorder and other stuff as well and around two years ago I just couldn't sleep anymore. When it was time to go to sleep I would see nightmares, I had flashbacks, physical pain, paranoia, I was afraid I would go crazy or into a psychosis etc. At the time I didn't have any sleep meds, so my life was balancing between sleeping very little, not sleeping at all and enduring the aforementioned horrors. Then I got prescribed Mirtazapine as a very low dose ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirtazapine) ). Mirtazapin has this strange effect, that if you take very little of it, it makes you more sleepy than taking a lot. In larger doses it's used a depression medicine etc. but in small doses it's used a sleeping medicine. According to my doctor the main thing that makes you sleep is antihistamine. 

In the beginning Mirtazapin made me sleep but I would feel like zombie afterwards and it was almost more horrific than not using it and not sleeping. But after a while I got used to it and found a good dosage. I've been using it for two years now. It helps me to sleep and I don't really feel it's effect any more during other times of the days. I've had like two days during the last 2 years I've slept without it. Except for during this week I got a new weight blanket and I've been experimenting with sleeping without pills again. And I've succeedeed in it twice! During those night i didn't sleep much, but I could still sleep and I wouldn't panic or get afraid of going crazy during the night. It took me ages to fall asleep both nights, but it felt ok to just lie in the bed half asleep. And the thought helped that if it would get worse, I could just pop a pill and sleep normal again. 

I feel like I'm not ready to completely stop using Mirtazapine yet, but I feel like I want to go without it at least some times and increase the nights without it little bit little. I feel more clear after not using, even though it doesn't really feel good to sleep so little.

bbz9ka,Advice on family members who are triggers,"Incredibly brief background: I have Asperger's and experienced emotional trauma from my childhood and upbringing.

I'm in a bit of a difficult situation at the moment. I have recently begun talking to my family again over email after avoiding contact for a year as I needed to distance myself from them. I have a great deal of trauma attached to my birth name which I no longer use and they put very little effort into understanding this and not using it when talking to or about me. I also have trauma associated with my upbringing and my family's behaviour to me as a child.

The conversations were over email and it felt as if they had begun to be more understanding of this. Recently my Mother came to visit me and after about an hour into her being here, I noticed I had begun to feel extremely nauseous, very anxious and uncomfortable, to the point where I really struggled to focus and maintain socialising for the rest of the day and for the rest of her visit. I had a really hard time falling asleep because these feelings did not subside and instead had gotten worse, leaving me up overthinking to the point of crying and feeling like I needed to throw up as if I had something stuck in my throat.

Even though they have not purposefully me any wrongdoing and that I still love them as family, I feel as if I would be putting myself through more than it is worth and more than I can deal with if I continued keeping in contact with them. I feel great deals of guilt when considering cutting them out of my life but I honestly don't know if there is a better option at this point other than doing this and seeing a therapist.

People say that you are meant to remove from your life things that are triggering for past trauma, but what do you do when this trigger is a person, especially a family member or members?

I am really stuck here, sometimes I feel as if I am being over sensitive and nasty about this, but other times I feel justified and this is the right thing to do for myself. I can't tell if I am being unreasonable/unfair or not and would really appreciate a second opinion on this.",TooManyHappy,2019-04-11 05:27:00,2,402,36.93,17.86,97.77,2.93,28.71,15.92,94.78,63.68,19.15,13.43,10.45,0,0.75,0.5,1.74,5.72,4.98,16.17,8.96,5.97,10.95,1.74,16.17,7.21,5.22,1.74,0.25,1.24,5.47,1.49,3.98,1.24,0.25,0.25,9.45,1.24,0.5,0.75,0,15.67,3.98,1.99,2.74,3.73,0.5,7.21,2.99,0.25,0.25,2.24,1.74,0.5,1,0,0,6.22,2.24,0.75,1.74,1,0.75,4.23,8.71,0,14.68,2.74,6.22,5.97,0.5,1,1,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.21,2.99,2.24,0.25,0,0.25,0,0,0,1.24,0,0.25

bc0r93,Told my friend I was assaulted by a homeless man yesterday (I was) and she just texted back “yikes” and it’s really bothering me. Thought she was my friend but then she was so dismissive,"tw: abuse, rape, disordered eating 



long story short, I was abused by my biological, foster, and adoptive family, as well as by someone who raped me many times over th course of a year and tried to kill me a few time. So, I got some “baggage.” 



Yesterday a homeless man cornered me on the bus and tried to kiss me, but someone made him get off the bus. Everyone on the bus thought it was funny because the homeless man thought I was a girl, but it wasn’t funny. I wanted to cry. As dumb as it is I also felt embarrassed that someone else rescued me instead of me standing up for myself. Seems I’ve learned absolutely nothing and not progressed as a person at all. 


Then, I went home and binged and purged and did an enema because that’s what I always did after being raped and wanting to be clean. I was distressed. Therapy also got cancelled because of a random blizzard of 18 inches of snow in fucking april. 



I was really upset, and my friend just texts back “yikes.” Does anybody understand that this is a serious illness? ANYONE would’ve been upset if a homeless man tried to kiss them. But i ALSO got especially upset because I have PTSD. I just feel so disregarded. At least I have other great friends to support me.

My mom committed suicide. Do not pity her. She did this specifically to screw with me, that's how vindictive she was after years of physical and then more years after that of emotional and verbal abuse. I took it and did it proudly because it protected my little brother and I would do it again 50 times over. When my mom went absolutely insane a couple years before her death, I took care of everything, she was in jail, I visited her I would say every week except missing when I was too sick with migraines to drive or with bad roads. Anytime I missed I could expect a letter about how much she hated me. After she was divorced I stored all her things in the basement. I let her have unlimited access, she stole from me. She liked to torture me over suicide with multiple failed attempts and asking if I had her stepladder only to after me giving it to her have her text me about how she was about to kill herself, knowing I would be there because it was my duty. Her last day alive, she asked for access to her things, said that was fine but I was at work so it would probably have to wait for the weekend, she proceeded to tell me how awful a daughter I was, deserving of hell, how much she hated me etc. I told her (finally) to get over herself, she hung herself that night while I was searching for her. 


After, I thought I had to be the matriarch. I had to be strong for everyone, including my brother. So at 22 I planned my first funeral 7 days after my 22nd birthday and 7 days before Christmas. While everyone was shopping for gifts I was shopping for an appropriate turtle neck to cover signs of her death. I hated her more than I thought I could hate anyone and it hurt. It still hurts but 5 years later Im thankful I dont have an abuser anymore. Im working on being ok with being happy she is dead, that she doesnt deserve anything just for the title of ""mom"" and that I dont have to keep her crap or her ashes out of duty. I owe her nothing. 


You know what, tonight Im going to go get some of her favorite tequila, empty it any way I want, because I am not her and I dont hurt people when I drink and throw some ashes in there.

\------------------------------  


Dear Tom,

	It's been a long time since I've even thought about wanting to talk to you. For me, I never have to ask why that is; although the question of why you think that is, may be different. I wanted to write a letter to address that specific topic, as well a few other topics that have been on my mind for a long time. I've never felt like I could ever be open with you, there are a lot of reasons for it. I want to address these things in this letter and maybe, for the first time, you could actually get to know a little about me. You may think you know me, but I challenge you to even try to explain who i am, what i love, how i love. I know that you can't tell me these things because it has taken me decades to even understand them myself. I suppose we're all changing, some more than others, as time passes. For me it isn't any different.

	I wake up in the morning to the sunrise, it shoots through my curtains to greet me. I leave my woman and dog to sleep in and make my coffee, on time, every morning. While waiting, I lean against the counter and gaze out the back window. A field of green grass and trees beyond that, about a quarter mile down. I have a nice plot in amish country. All day long the clop-clop-clop of Amish wagons by the house. My house is small but respectable, it's an atomic-age rancher with updated interior and appliances. Every inch of this house is filled with our things, each of us having our own spaces, so we can share what we want but still have our little worlds. In the back we have about 300 varying herbs, flowers, and crops planted so far; she prefers the sweeter smelling herbs and I prefer the peppers. I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that's a registered service animal. It's actually surprising just how smart a dog can be. Someone dumped off a broken lawn mower the other day, I had a good time bringing it back to life. Earlier this year, a coworker couldn't figure out how to fix his truck; i managed to do it for him. It's only work when you're not having fun, right? When i'm doing these things, i achieve a peace that i have rarely ever felt in my life.

	Peace is very important for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. My symptoms began around the age of 9 or 10. The depression was crushing. I also have had disassociative states, where entire days would pass and I wouldn't even notice. I guess the teachers started noticing that a student simply sat and stared for 8 hours without even uttering a word or opening a book. Besides that, was the fight or flight response that I would get from things that didn't make sense. I was so used to getting pounded or screamed at for simple things like asking a question or making a noise, that when I would be called on in school, I would become completely rattled. I never knew when the next attack from you would come, the anxiety kept me on edge and my nerves have been rattled my entire life because of that. 

	I also had the anger to deal with. The only thing I understood about the anger was that it was always at myself, for being a failure. I hated myself, most of the time, for the first 20 years of my life. You never really took any interest in knowing what school was like for me; every now and then you'd ask ""how's school?"", as if that wasn't a rhetorical question. Any answer other than ""good"" would result in a melt down on your part and another attack; probably at some time that night, but I could never really tell. To say the least, because of this environment, my grades were never as good as they could have been. I was too busy wondering why I could never feel happy, talk to others, have fun. The closest thing I could compare to that was playing video games; but now I understand that in those stupid games I found a sense of peace. I was somewhere else in those games. A place away from you. Peace is important for people with PTSD.

	So you might be wondering what PTSD actually is. Honestly, I don't blame you if you don't know. You probably have seen some of it or have heard of some of it in those who went through the universally despised Vietnam War. There's a lot more awareness now for this disease in this day and age because of the 18 years of war our country has gone through and for our ability to communicate instantly. Or maybe it's the fact that it's come to light that more than 20 of our heroes commit suicide every day due to this disease. It's more than 7000 a year, about twice the number we lost on 9/11 and it has left my generation shattered and feeling lost. Even those who don't die, still suffer. Millions with drug problems, doing time that or for assault when they can't control this horrifying disease and it destroys what little they have left to love. But war PTSD is different from what I have for one main reason: before the years of combat, before the trauma, the victim knew what it was like to be ""normal"", then there was the trauma, and now they're not and will never be ""normal"" again. For me that's very different because I never knew what ""normal"" was. My earliest memories are of you abusing me. I never knew a life without anxiety or depression, so for me this has been a lifelong illness. 

	The affects of the disease can vary from person to person. While most experience nearly all the symptoms, the level of those symptoms can be different. The ones I most commonly experience are extreme anxiety, depression, nightmares, flashbacks, anger. 

	I have nightmares most nights. I know this because I've been told by friends and girlfriends over the past 15 years or so that I act very strange in my sleep. Most of the time I don't remember them, but instead I wake up and vomit. Other times I wake up struggling, even throwing punches. Sometimes I hit my woman, and it hurts her. I feel like a monster when that happens. Every few months I'll have a dream that doesn't involve me being murdered or being powerless to stop those I care about from dying in some way, which is nice.

	My anxiety is crushing. My hands permanently shake. Writing with a pen or pencil is almost impossible. There are times that ignorant people will say ""What's wrong with you?"". The anxiety has cost me many jobs. There are times when I'm at work, I feel completely surrounded and under attack for no apparent reason; I just have to leave. They usually fire me for this. I just have to get out of the building, away from everyone. Another thing about this is that i absolutely cannot have people touch me. Not even my woman touches me, I have to be the one to initiate contact. You can imagine how hard this is for someone who wants to get laid; thankfully my woman understands it and loves me regardless. There are also little things that my anxiety does to disrupt my life, like obsessingly checking locks to make sure no one is going to just barge into my house or my room and start beating on me or screaming at me. Or the fact that i cannot ever have a person stand behind me. In grocery lines I solved this by standing sideways. When this isn't possible, I leave.

	My depression has dominated my life. I started hating myself at a very young age. I acted out on this by destroying my own possessions, I felt like i didn't deserve them for my failures. I've had problems with suicidal thoughts for a long, long time. For years, I kept a rope under my bed and a razor in my wallet, just in case. Just in case i'll have to end my life that day. Sometimes I would lie awake in bed, thinking about where and how I'll do it. I think about the fallout. I decided that using a gun was bad, because it would be rude to whoever found my corpse. I guess that puts things in perspective: when I care more about a stranger finding my corpse or cleaning crew having to come, than actually ending my own life. If you want to know what real depression is, maybe that would explain it for you.

	Since my diagnosis, I have come to understand why I am this way and what i can do about it. I surround myself with peace, but I'm always prepared for war. I have axes, knives, clubs and guns. For someone trying to find peace, I suppose it's ironic that there's always a need to be prepared to defend myself still. I hope that in the future i can feel safe without all these weapons, but I don't think that day will ever come. 

	I'm not writing this letter just to talk about myself though, I wanted to talk about you and I as well. 

	You have always been a sort of mystery to me. When I would sneak into your room when you were gone, I was surprised to see that there isn't much there. A room so clean you can do surgery in it, it doesn't look lived in at all; but instead more like an Ikea display. So that didn't teach me anything. Around the house are generic things.. fake plants and every inch perfectly clean. Every piece of furniture, in it's exact place. The way it's always been. The only real material possessions you have are in the boxes in the basement. I went through them, trying to find out more. I found a lot of things, mostly photos. It occured to me that you never took any of them yourself. They were taken by others and put in a box by you and stored. I always wondered why they weren't put out like in every house I've ever been to. So I failed there too; I could only find a whisper of your past. The same was about my mother. You showed me a picture of her once. I ended up stealing a photo of her, it's the only one I have: a 2 inch square black and white passport photo. I always wondered why you just erased her, why I never heard about her. Growing up, because I lost her so young, I never felt like I had a mother. I had you, but I didn't even know you. You never really were a parent to me, more like a strange man who acted erratic and was completely unpredictable: either shower me in gifts no apparent reason or beat on me for no apparent reason. I do know that you're more learned than you let on, however. When you talk about technical things, I listened. It was the only times you weren't going off on a tangent, completely silent, or putting others down. You might be surprised to find out that unlike my brother, I don't have memory problems. Infact, I'm quite the opposite and likely to be on the autism spectrum because it's so unusual. So when it came to these details, I remembered them; and on numerous occasions people have been very impressed that i can rattle of technical details about random things like air conditioning or cars for example. Beyond that though, when you get right down to it, I never really knew you. We spent time together, which was a part of the bipolar way I was raised; where it actually seemed like you cared. We watched movies or would go hiking, but I didn't learn anything about you. So when it comes to having parents, I can't really say i've had the experience. I suppose the best thing you ever done in that field was reading to me and doing the voices the one year. That was A+ dadding. But before that was the abuse and after that was just endless abuse and neglect. 

&amp;#x200B;

	You used to say a lot of things to me that weren't true. It took me a long time to figure out that they weren't true, too. Apparently it's a scientific fact that children believe what they're told without asking questions a lot because it's the difference between the kids who got eaten by lions a hundred thousand years ago and those who didn't. So when it came to the things you'd say to me, like the really negative ones, I always believed you. You also kept me in the house, no after school activities, no friends over, no going out... this changed very slightly as I got to around 15, but not by much. I was often forced to stay in my room, many nights, sleeping on that mattressless bunk bed, wondering why I am such a piece of shit. You would always drop the line ""you're destroying this family"" as you would abuse me. As you would force me to take my clothes off and parade me infront of my siblings, as you would destroy my possessions, hit me, choke me, throw me down stairs; or just spend hours upon hours drilling it into my head that am neither loved nor wanted. 

	But now I understand that statement, as an adult, without a mind of a child. when you said ""you're destroying the family""; what you meant was something different. ""Family"" didn't mean you and me and my siblings... how could bad grades destroy them? Or a spilled glass of water? Or staying up too late one night? No, ""Family"" meant you and your grip on controlling us. The grip you feared to lose because you were afraid of the government stepping in and providing for us. Not out of some altruistic feeling on your part, or some fear of a tyrannical NAZI government; but because it would mean you were a failure. Well, fearing failure is something you taught me well; however since you also taught me I'd never succeed at anything, you really fucked up my head in that sense too. So as I digress, what you really meant was ""you're destroying my ability to control you out of fear"" ... so the more I understand that statement now, the less it hurts me. 

	You'd also say ""I put a roof over your head"". This was very common. It didn't matter what the exact words were in this case, but the theme was important. ""I did my job, so now you owe me"". That's a part of your psyche in general, not just how you raised me. Whenever you give a gift, you have an ulterior motive. If that motive can't be fullfilled, you rage. You disappear. You hurt others. You claim that you're the victim, which is another common part of your psyche. If your ability to put people against one another, or to hurt and put down others is interrupted, then you're the one who was being hurt the whole time. I always thought the duality of your narcissism and playing the victim was ironic. Funny how you can throw a 4 year old down a  flight of stairs, or beat on a 9 year old girl over and over again and claim at the same time that they were the one hurting you; and that you're awesome for fighting back to protect the ""family"". 

	You aren't just this way with your kids though, you're always this way. One factor i've always learned about you though is that when you're faced with a challenger, perhaps someone who isn't a child or a subordinate; someone who could kick your ass, you always back down. I grew up thinking you were strong because the mind of a child thinks what they're told. I now know better. Strength isn't hurting people, strength is helping people. Love isn't caging what you care about, it's about putting the pieces back together and making it better so it can be free. These things I never learned from you; I'd say I owe a debt to those who did teach me these things, but love doesn't collect on debt.

	I could go on for a thousand pages about what you've said. Some of my favorites are when you said you cancelled your life insurance because if you suddenly died, you wanted me to struggle.  As though I really hated you so much or felt nothing for you that I would care more about the money than the fact I've become a fucking orphan. There was also the time that you taught me how to properly cut my wrists. The ""zig-zag"" style, you called it. then you gave me a knife. Wow, that's really great parenting, Tom. 

	Words can hurt, but all of that doesn't quite compare to when I was 14, though. I got sick, remember? I mean, really sick. Pneumonia. It was bad. Fever of over 105, I couldn't walk, eat or drink. You did get around you taking me to a hospital, the next day. You threw me a wet, filthy, wash cloth from the sink and went to work instead that night. You always did this sort of thing. Tom, if you think for a second that i believe (or literally anyone else believes) that ""my kid is dying"" isn't a good enough excuse to call out, you're not even a good liar. You abandoned me. I suffered that night, it was bad. my brother was terrified too. he hates that you put him in charge, he wasn't ready for it. Looking back on that, and the other times you abused me, I can honestly say that it was different that time. The other times, I don't think you wanted me to die, but that time I'd have to say that I really think you did. It was attempted murder by intentional negligence. That's a pretty heavy sentence, Tom. Especially for a parent on their own child, and it would have been a quick trial too.. who are your character witnesses? Your traumatized children who ran off in their teens who have nothing but stories of abuse from you? Your brother and his kids who witnessed your abuse first hand, who you threatened to murder; even after they took you in their own home? That's 25 to life in prison, Tom. If you don't think for a second that I didn't consider pressing charges on you, you're even more arrogant than I thought.

	You might argue that your love for me was in the things you bought me. I had a lot of toys; action figures, video games, a bike and eventually a car that i was allowed to use. One of the things about you though is that you there's always a reason for your ""gifts"". The toys were a way of saying ""sorry I bashed your head the other day"", or maybe ""please don't tip off the school officials about what I've done to you by being happy for a minute"". The car was a way of saying ""please disappear"". If you feel I misjudged you in this way, maybe you can explain why you did this for me and not my brother? Is it because you truly love me, or because you knew you could manipulate him and you got pleasure out that, and I was ""destroying the family"" so I had to go? Hell, the last time you messaged me, some 4 years ago, you wanted to go to a baseball game with me. OK tom, what's the catch? What do you want from me? This isn't an apology for what you did to me and my siblings or my mother. This isn't an apology for calling me a ""bad investment"" the previous time we spoke and I needed you. So what's your angle? I hope you're not so arrogant and self absorbed to think that I have a simple ""grudge"" against you or that I'm being unreasonably emotional. There's always a reason for your ""gifts"".

&amp;#x200B;

	Sometimes you did things for outward appearances. Like when you made my lunch, you used to coach me on what to tell teachers. Lie, after lie, after lie. ""Nice lunch, too bad the fridge has been empty for 15 years"", ""nice lunch, why are you 35% under weight?"", ""nice lunch, why don't you talk to others?"", ""nice lunch, why do you go to the bathroom and cry?"". Those are the truths. Eventually you stuffed enough fried chicken down my throat and forced me to stay in my room that I got fat. Kinda hard to look malnurished and traumatized when you're fat, right? Appearances were very important to you. We had to look good. The rest doesn't matter. Grades were an important part of that, too. Not that you cared enough to help me, or to try to understand why abusing your kids doesn't help them do better in school. You never wondered why your kid couldn't read or write at the age of seven, or why he always got some letters backwards because he's dyslexic. It was just negative re-enforcement followed by occasional showering of gifts. Your only interest in ""raising"" me was holding on to your power to control others at all costs. Your only fear was that I would disrupt that control and ""destroy the family"".

	Another inspiring and altruistic thing you'd do is lying to people about me. Remember the lies? I do. I was listening. You'd tell teachers that I had all these problems because my mother died when I was young. It was always the same story. You go to play the victim while being the predator at the same time, at the expense of my mother. That's an unbelievable act of psychotic evil that still astonishes me to this day. 

&amp;#x200B;

	I tried to explain what it was like to be ""raised"" by you to a professional. She stopped me about a quarter of the way in and her face looked absolutely horrified. she wrote me four prescriptions and shuttled me out. Apparently just talking about it was too much for her to listen to. While it validates that I am in fact, not the bad guy, it at the same time makes the depression worse. How could a mental health professional not even want to listen to this? Either she thought I was lying and a nutcase for making it all up, or that it's all true and she wanted to quit her job because you're just that horrible. The pills didn't help, either.

	Moving forward, I have some plans. I have learned a lot, from those who care about me. I learned how to be impulsive. How to protect others. How to be forgiving. How to be understanding. How to accept others. I learned how not to destroy a family, but to build one. But by your definition of that ugly, evil phrase; I guess I had to destroy a family in order to build one. I had to disrupt your control of me in order to become something worth living.

	I'm not going to tell you what I am going to do with myself. You don't deserve that, even if you've changed your mind about wanting to actually know me in my absence. I will tell you how I'm moving forward without you though.

	On days like this, when the sun shines through the curtains; my woman and my dog snore soundly. I wake up and make my coffee the same time as every day and I look out that window. I think about my garden, the herbs and potatoes and I think the smell of the stew my woman is going to make for me later; because she loves seeing me enjoy something she makes. I think about my father in law coming over with their kids and grand kids and how I'm going to work the hell out of that tiny grill. We'll talk politics or cars and play with the kids. My woman will compare tattoo art and shoot the shit about training  PTSD service dogs. Or maybe my father in law will just show me how to loosen that rusted bolt on the mower; because that's what good fathers do. Not because I asked, but because he wants to teach me. 	

	I think about this and I'm surrounded by peace and love but I can't escape your words or your actions. They're so numerous, I could write a thousand pages of all the fucked up things you did and said to me and it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't be enough because as long as I wake up, covered in sweat on days like this; fearing for my life and angry at everything, I cannot escape what you did to me. It's taking years and I've given up on the medications. They were just covering it up, not fixing it. It turns that out I don't need antipsychotics, antidepressants, therapists. My therapy is a civil conversation, my antidepressant is working the dirt and my antipsychotic is having a laugh playing a board game with my family. This is my future now, and it won't be all great. We'll get sick, have problems, and we'll die; eventually. But the past doesn't rule my future, I know that now. 

	It's different for you, though. Because you're not getting any more chances from me. You hurt me again and again for 28 years and showed absolutely no remorse. Never an apology you actually meant. I used to think that hate was the opposite of love, but now I know that nothing is the opposite of love. You've proven to me again and again that you nothing me, so now I can say that I nothing you back. So when you think of me, there won't be a future. I'll always be in your past as you will always be in mine.

	This letter might be addressed to you, but it's not really for you. It's for me. To close an ugly chapter in my life that was dominated by you. It's an open letter, I have no shame in being abused by you. I will not keep your secrets, not anymore. I guess i'll have to ""destroy the family"".

I hope that some of you can relate and that it brings a bit of hope, among all the anger that infects us.

Dear Tom
It's been a long time since I've even thought about wanting to talk to you. For me, I never have to ask why that is; although the question of why you think that is, may be different. I wanted to write a letter to address that specific topic, as well a few other topics that have been on my mind for a long time. I've never felt like I could ever be open with you, there are a lot of reasons for it. I want to address these things in this letter and maybe, for the first time, you could actually get to know a little about me. You may think you know me, but I challenge you to even try to explain who i am, what i love, how i love. I know that you can't tell me these things because it has taken me decades to even understand them myself. I suppose we're all changing, some more than others, as time passes. For me it isn't any different.

I wake up in the morning to the sunrise, it shoots through my curtains to greet me. I leave my woman and dog to sleep in and make my coffee, on time, every morning. While waiting, I lean against the counter and gaze out the back window. A field of green grass and trees beyond that, about a quarter mile down. I have a nice plot in amish country. All day long the clop-clop-clop of Amish wagons by the house. My house is small but respectable, it's an atomic-age rancher with updated interior and appliances. Every inch of this house is filled with our things, each of us having our own spaces, so we can share what we want but still have our little worlds. In the back we have about 300 varying herbs, flowers, and crops planted so far; she prefers the sweeter smelling herbs and I prefer the peppers. I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that's a registered service animal. It's actually surprising just how smart a dog can be. Someone dumped off a broken lawn mower the other day, I had a good time bringing it back to life. Earlier this year, a coworker couldn't figure out how to fix his truck; i managed to do it for him. It's only work when you're not having fun, right? When i'm doing these things, i achieve a peace that i have rarely ever felt in my life.

Peace is very important for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. My symptoms began around the age of 9 or 10. The depression was crushing. I also have had disassociative states, where entire days would pass and I wouldn't even notice. I guess the teachers started noticing that a student simply sat and stared for 8 hours without even uttering a word or opening a book. Besides that, was the fight or flight response that I would get from things that didn't make sense. I was so used to getting pounded or screamed at for simple things like asking a question or making a noise, that when I would be called on in school, I would become completely rattled. I never knew when the next attack from you would come, the anxiety kept me on edge and my nerves have been rattled my entire life because of that.

I also had the anger to deal with. The only thing I understood about the anger was that it was always at myself, for being a failure. I hated myself, most of the time, for the first 20 years of my life. You never really took any interest in knowing what school was like for me; every now and then you'd ask ""how's school?"", as if that wasn't a rhetorical question. Any answer other than ""good"" would result in a melt down on your part and another attack; probably at some time that night, but I could never really tell. To say the least, because of this environment, my grades were never as good as they could have been. I was too busy wondering why I could never feel happy, talk to others, have fun. The closest thing I could compare to that was playing video games; but now I understand that in those stupid games I found a sense of peace. I was somewhere else in those games. A place away from you. Peace is important for people with PTSD.

So you might be wondering what PTSD actually is. Honestly, I don't blame you if you don't know. You probably have seen some of it or have heard of some of it in those who went through the universally despised Vietnam War. There's a lot more awareness now for this disease in this day and age because of the 18 years of war our country has gone through and for our ability to communicate instantly. Or maybe it's the fact that it's come to light that more than 20 of our heroes commit suicide every day due to this disease. It's more than 7000 a year, about twice the number we lost on 9/11 and it has left my generation shattered and feeling lost. Even those who don't die, still suffer. Millions with drug problems, doing time that or for assault when they can't control this horrifying disease and it destroys what little they have left to love. But war PTSD is different from what I have for one main reason: before the years of combat, before the trauma, the victim knew what it was like to be ""normal"", then there was the trauma, and now they're not and will never be ""normal"" again. For me that's very different because I never knew what ""normal"" was. My earliest memories are of you abusing me. I never knew a life without anxiety or depression, so for me this has been a lifelong illness.

The affects of the disease can vary from person to person. While most experience nearly all the symptoms, the level of those symptoms can be different. The ones I most commonly experience are extreme anxiety, depression, nightmares, flashbacks, anger.

I have nightmares most nights. I know this because I've been told by friends and girlfriends over the past 15 years or so that I act very strange in my sleep. Most of the time I don't remember them, but instead I wake up and vomit. Other times I wake up struggling, even throwing punches. Sometimes I hit my woman, and it hurts her. I feel like a monster when that happens. Every few months I'll have a dream that doesn't involve me being murdered or being powerless to stop those I care about from dying in some way, which is nice.

My anxiety is crushing. My hands permanently shake. Writing with a pen or pencil is almost impossible. There are times that ignorant people will say ""What's wrong with you?"". The anxiety has cost me many jobs. There are times when I'm at work, I feel completely surrounded and under attack for no apparent reason; I just have to leave. They usually fire me for this. I just have to get out of the building, away from everyone. Another thing about this is that i absolutely cannot have people touch me. Not even my woman touches me, I have to be the one to initiate contact. You can imagine how hard this is for someone who wants to get laid; thankfully my woman understands it and loves me regardless. There are also little things that my anxiety does to disrupt my life, like obsessingly checking locks to make sure no one is going to just barge into my house or my room and start beating on me or screaming at me. Or the fact that i cannot ever have a person stand behind me. In grocery lines I solved this by standing sideways. When this isn't possible, I leave.

My depression has dominated my life. I started hating myself at a very young age. I acted out on this by destroying my own possessions, I felt like i didn't deserve them for my failures. I've had problems with suicidal thoughts for a long, long time. For years, I kept a rope under my bed and a razor in my wallet, just in case. Just in case i'll have to end my life that day. Sometimes I would lie awake in bed, thinking about where and how I'll do it. I think about the fallout. I decided that using a gun was bad, because it would be rude to whoever found my corpse. I guess that puts things in perspective: when I care more about a stranger finding my corpse or cleaning crew having to come, than actually ending my own life. If you want to know what real depression is, maybe that would explain it for you.

Since my diagnosis, I have come to understand why I am this way and what i can do about it. I surround myself with peace, but I'm always prepared for war. I have axes, knives, clubs and guns. For someone trying to find peace, I suppose it's ironic that there's always a need to be prepared to defend myself still. I hope that in the future i can feel safe without all these weapons, but I don't think that day will ever come.

I'm not writing this letter just to talk about myself though, I wanted to talk about you and I as well.

You have always been a sort of mystery to me. When I would sneak into your room when you were gone, I was surprised to see that there isn't much there. A room so clean you can do surgery in it, it doesn't look lived in at all; but instead more like an Ikea display. So that didn't teach me anything. Around the house are generic things.. fake plants and every inch perfectly clean. Every piece of furniture, in it's exact place. The way it's always been. The only real material possessions you have are in the boxes in the basement. I went through them, trying to find out more. I found a lot of things, mostly photos. It occured to me that you never took any of them yourself. They were taken by others and put in a box by you and stored. I always wondered why they weren't put out like in every house I've ever been to. So I failed there too; I could only find a whisper of your past. The same was about my mother. You showed me a picture of her once. I ended up stealing a photo of her, it's the only one I have: a 2 inch square black and white passport photo. I always wondered why you just erased her, why I never heard about her. Growing up, because I lost her so young, I never felt like I had a mother. I had you, but I didn't even know you. You never really were a parent to me, more like a strange man who acted erratic and was completely unpredictable: either shower me in gifts no apparent reason or beat on me for no apparent reason. I do know that you're more learned than you let on, however. When you talk about technical things, I listened. It was the only times you weren't going off on a tangent, completely silent, or putting others down. You might be surprised to find out that unlike my brother, I don't have memory problems. Infact, I'm quite the opposite and likely to be on the autism spectrum because it's so unusual. So when it came to these details, I remembered them; and on numerous occasions people have been very impressed that i can rattle of technical details about random things like air conditioning or cars for example. Beyond that though, when you get right down to it, I never really knew you. We spent time together, which was a part of the bipolar way I was raised; where it actually seemed like you cared. We watched movies or would go hiking, but I didn't learn anything about you. So when it comes to having parents, I can't really say i've had the experience. I suppose the best thing you ever done in that field was reading to me and doing the voices the one year. That was A+ dadding. But before that was the abuse and after that was just endless abuse and neglect.

You used to say a lot of things to me that weren't true. It took me a long time to figure out that they weren't true, too. Apparently it's a scientific fact that children believe what they're told without asking questions a lot because it's the difference between the kids who got eaten by lions a hundred thousand years ago and those who didn't. So when it came to the things you'd say to me, like the really negative ones, I always believed you. You also kept me in the house, no after school activities, no friends over, no going out... this changed very slightly as I got to around 15, but not by much. I was often forced to stay in my room, many nights, sleeping on that mattressless bunk bed, wondering why I am such a piece of shit. You would always drop the line ""you're destroying this family"" as you would abuse me. As you would force me to take my clothes off and parade me infront of my siblings, as you would destroy my possessions, hit me, choke me, throw me down stairs; or just spend hours upon hours drilling it into my head that am neither loved nor wanted.

But now I understand that statement, as an adult, without a mind of a child. when you said ""you're destroying the family""; what you meant was something different. ""Family"" didn't mean you and me and my siblings... how could bad grades destroy them? Or a spilled glass of water? Or staying up too late one night? No, ""Family"" meant you and your grip on controlling us. The grip you feared to lose because you were afraid of the government stepping in and providing for us. Not out of some altruistic feeling on your part, or some fear of a tyrannical NAZI government; but because it would mean you were a failure. Well, fearing failure is something you taught me well; however since you also taught me I'd never succeed at anything, you really fucked up my head in that sense too. So as I digress, what you really meant was ""you're destroying my ability to control you out of fear"" ... so the more I understand that statement now, the less it hurts me.

You'd also say ""I put a roof over your head"". This was very common. It didn't matter what the exact words were in this case, but the theme was important. ""I did my job, so now you owe me"". That's a part of your psyche in general, not just how you raised me. Whenever you give a gift, you have an ulterior motive. If that motive can't be fullfilled, you rage. You disappear. You hurt others. You claim that you're the victim, which is another common part of your psyche. If your ability to put people against one another, or to hurt and put down others is interrupted, then you're the one who was being hurt the whole time. I always thought the duality of your narcissism and playing the victim was ironic. Funny how you can throw a 4 year old down a flight of stairs, or beat on a 9 year old girl over and over again and claim at the same time that they were the one hurting you; and that you're awesome for fighting back to protect the ""family"".

You aren't just this way with your kids though, you're always this way. One factor i've always learned about you though is that when you're faced with a challenger, perhaps someone who isn't a child or a subordinate; someone who could kick your ass, you always back down. I grew up thinking you were strong because the mind of a child thinks what they're told. I now know better. Strength isn't hurting people, strength is helping people. Love isn't caging what you care about, it's about putting the pieces back together and making it better so it can be free. These things I never learned from you; I'd say I owe a debt to those who did teach me these things, but love doesn't collect on debt.

I could go on for a thousand pages about what you've said. Some of my favorites are when you said you cancelled your life insurance because if you suddenly died, you wanted me to struggle. As though I really hated you so much or felt nothing for you that I would care more about the money than the fact I've become a fucking orphan. There was also the time that you taught me how to properly cut my wrists. The ""zig-zag"" style, you called it. then you gave me a knife. Wow, that's really great parenting, Tom.

Words can hurt, but all of that doesn't quite compare to when I was 14, though. I got sick, remember? I mean, really sick. Pneumonia. It was bad. Fever of over 105, I couldn't walk, eat or drink. You did get around you taking me to a hospital, the next day. You threw me a wet, filthy, wash cloth from the sink and went to work instead that night. You always did this sort of thing. Tom, if you think for a second that i believe (or literally anyone else believes) that ""my kid is dying"" isn't a good enough excuse to call out, you're not even a good liar. You abandoned me. I suffered that night, it was bad. my brother was terrified too. he hates that you put him in charge, he wasn't ready for it. Looking back on that, and the other times you abused me, I can honestly say that it was different that time. The other times, I don't think you wanted me to die, but that time I'd have to say that I really think you did. It was attempted murder by intentional negligence. That's a pretty heavy sentence, Tom. Especially for a parent on their own child, and it would have been a quick trial too.. who are your character witnesses? Your traumatized children who ran off in their teens who have nothing but stories of abuse from you? Your brother and his kids who witnessed your abuse first hand, who you threatened to murder; even after they took you in their own home? That's 25 to life in prison, Tom. If you don't think for a second that I didn't consider pressing charges on you, you're even more arrogant than I thought.

You might argue that your love for me was in the things you bought me. I had a lot of toys; action figures, video games, a bike and eventually a car that i was allowed to use. One of the things about you though is that you there's always a reason for your ""gifts"". The toys were a way of saying ""sorry I bashed your head the other day"", or maybe ""please don't tip off the school officials about what I've done to you by being happy for a minute"". The car was a way of saying ""please disappear"". If you feel I misjudged you in this way, maybe you can explain why you did this for me and not my brother? Is it because you truly love me, or because you knew you could manipulate him and you got pleasure out that, and I was ""destroying the family"" so I had to go? Hell, the last time you messaged me, some 4 years ago, you wanted to go to a baseball game with me. OK tom, what's the catch? What do you want from me? This isn't an apology for what you did to me and my siblings or my mother. This isn't an apology for calling me a ""bad investment"" the previous time we spoke and I needed you. So what's your angle? I hope you're not so arrogant and self absorbed to think that I have a simple ""grudge"" against you or that I'm being unreasonably emotional. There's always a reason for your ""gifts"".

Sometimes you did things for outward appearances. Like when you made my lunch, you used to coach me on what to tell teachers. Lie, after lie, after lie. ""Nice lunch, too bad the fridge has been empty for 15 years"", ""nice lunch, why are you 35% under weight?"", ""nice lunch, why don't you talk to others?"", ""nice lunch, why do you go to the bathroom and cry?"". Those are the truths. Eventually you stuffed enough fried chicken down my throat and forced me to stay in my room that I got fat. Kinda hard to look malnurished and traumatized when you're fat, right? Appearances were very important to you. We had to look good. The rest doesn't matter. Grades were an important part of that, too. Not that you cared enough to help me, or to try to understand why abusing your kids doesn't help them do better in school. You never wondered why your kid couldn't read or write at the age of seven, or why he always got some letters backwards because he's dyslexic. It was just negative re-enforcement followed by occasional showering of gifts. Your only interest in ""raising"" me was holding on to your power to control others at all costs. Your only fear was that I would disrupt that control and ""destroy the family"".

Another inspiring and altruistic thing you'd do is lying to people about me. Remember the lies? I do. I was listening. You'd tell teachers that I had all these problems because my mother died when I was young. It was always the same story. You go to play the victim while being the predator at the same time, at the expense of my mother. That's an unbelievable act of psychotic evil that still astonishes me to this day.

I tried to explain what it was like to be ""raised"" by you to a professional. She stopped me about a quarter of the way in and her face looked absolutely horrified. she wrote me four prescriptions and shuttled me out. Apparently just talking about it was too much for her to listen to. While it validates that I am in fact, not the bad guy, it at the same time makes the depression worse. How could a mental health professional not even want to listen to this? Either she thought I was lying and a nutcase for making it all up, or that it's all true and she wanted to quit her job because you're just that horrible. The pills didn't help, either.

Moving forward, I have some plans. I have learned a lot, from those who care about me. I learned how to be impulsive. How to protect others. How to be forgiving. How to be understanding. How to accept others. I learned how not to destroy a family, but to build one. But by your definition of that ugly, evil phrase; I guess I had to destroy a family in order to build one. I had to disrupt your control of me in order to become something worth living.

I'm not going to tell you what I am going to do with myself. You don't deserve that, even if you've changed your mind about wanting to actually know me in my absence. I will tell you how I'm moving forward without you though.

On days like this, when the sun shines through the curtains; my woman and my dog snore soundly. I wake up and make my coffee the same time as every day and I look out that window. I think about my garden, the herbs and potatoes and I think the smell of the stew my woman is going to make for me later; because she loves seeing me enjoy something she makes. I think about my father in law coming over with their kids and grand kids and how I'm going to work the hell out of that tiny grill. We'll talk politics or cars and play with the kids. My woman will compare tattoo art and shoot the shit about training PTSD service dogs. Or maybe my father in law will just show me how to loosen that rusted bolt on the mower; because that's what good fathers do. Not because I asked, but because he wants to teach me.

I think about this and I'm surrounded by peace and love but I can't escape your words or your actions. They're so numerous, I could write a thousand pages of all the fucked up things you did and said to me and it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't be enough because as long as I wake up, covered in sweat on days like this; fearing for my life and angry at everything, I cannot escape what you did to me. It's taking years and I've given up on the medications. They were just covering it up, not fixing it. It turns that out I don't need antipsychotics, antidepressants, therapists. My therapy is a civil conversation, my antidepressant is working the dirt and my antipsychotic is having a laugh playing a board game with my family. This is my future now, and it won't be all great. We'll get sick, have problems, and we'll die; eventually. But the past doesn't rule my future, I know that now.

It's different for you, though. Because you're not getting any more chances from me. You hurt me again and again for 28 years and showed absolutely no remorse. Never an apology you actually meant. I used to think that hate was the opposite of love, but now I know that nothing is the opposite of love. You've proven to me again and again that you nothing me, so now I can say that I nothing you back. So when you think of me, there won't be a future. I'll always be in your past as you will always be in mine.

This letter might be addressed to you, but it's not really for you. It's for me. To close an ugly chapter in my life that was dominated by you. It's an open letter, I have no shame in being abused by you. I will not keep your secrets, not anymore. I guess i'll have to ""destroy the family"".",HeartAegis,2019-04-11 10:48:08,2,4512,22.67,48.76,85.09,10.61,15.04,13.41,93.55,62.19,22.72,14.78,8.58,0.49,4.61,0.62,0.49,7.91,5.85,13.1,10.44,7.42,7,2.81,18.71,3.99,2.3,2.5,1.15,2.15,6.25,2.53,3.72,0.49,1.55,0.71,11.13,0.66,0.16,0.69,0.44,16.45,3.32,2.48,1.86,3.5,2.3,4.96,2.39,0.69,0.71,0.78,2.22,0.55,1.02,0.07,0.4,6.89,1.75,1.04,3.15,0.91,0.66,5.81,10.55,1.17,12.85,1.71,5.56,5.81,1.66,0.93,0.89,0.33,0.09,0.4,0.4,0.18,0.02,0.11,0.09,0,17.64,6.47,4.85,0.09,0.6,0.47,0,0.11,1.46,3.48,0.04,0.07

bc4oxu,Feel like I've lost years of progress during career break,"Over years of education and working I got to the point where I could be around groups of people without that constant feeling of being on edge; I was still jumpier than average, and I had my bad days, but I felt like I'd finally reached the point where I could say I was (at least externally) functioning the same as I might have if all the things that went on when I was younger hadn't happened. 

Then I had some time off work after my husband and I got married and moved, and now that I've started somewhere else it's like I've lost most of the ground I covered. I'm constantly on edge, I can't deal with people walking behind me at all, I'm getting invasive thoughts, and I'm just going in for the odd seminar or lab to get acquainted with what I'll be doing and who I'll be working with when I start properly. Who knows what it will be like when I'm actually working. I feel like I've already caught people giving me odd looks when I overreact and thinking about that is making me worse. 

I feel so frustrated with myself for letting this happen. I could have mitigated this if I'd gone out more, volunteered, started work earlier, anything like that. But I didn't and now I'm stuck feeling like it's going to take the same amount of time to get back where I was.

Last quarter was extremely rough for me. I was under a crazy amount of stress from taking 18 credits and being in a shitty 4-person team for 10 weeks where I did most, if not all, of the work. I ended with a 3.96 cumulative GPA for the quarter so it worked out in an academic sense but now I’m experiencing weird stuff that’s really bothering me.

* Symptoms I’ve noticed: *
- Feeling emotionally disconnected from everyone else

- Feeling like I’m “different”

- Extreme loneliness

- Not feeling like myself/identity confusion

- Loss of interest in things I enjoy

- Avoidance

- Heightened anxiety / fear of experiencing the same thing I went through

- Distrust / feelings of not being safe

- Severe irritability 

I know most of y’all are not doctors, I’d appreciate some direction as to if PTSD is a possibility. I will see my psychiatrist soon, but I’d still like to hear from people who live with PTSD.

bca7j5,Convinced that somethings going to make everyone not believe me,"Tw: sexual assault 
I don’t know if this is a normal symptom or not and it’d be nice if someone could reply on this if they get it too. I was sexually assaulted in late June, diagnosed with PTSD earlier this month and I’m slowly figuring out that I’m having common symptoms, which is helpful. 

One thing I do though is I almost search subreddits (his best friend and him both use Reddit I don’t know their accounts) and whenever I see literally any post about someone having an awful lying friend I am CONVINCED it’s me. I had to eventually put my phone down yesterday because I was having a panic attack looking at things. It’s like I want to be lying about my assault. I want proof that I’m lying. There is none, because it happened and I don’t know why I seem to want to have lied about this. I don’t know if that makes sense.",havinganotgreattime,2019-04-11 23:04:33,6,169,2,10.72,89.12,1,18.78,15.98,97.63,62.13,26.63,14.79,12.43,0,0,1.18,1.18,11.83,1.78,8.88,15.38,5.92,8.28,4.14,28.4,4.73,1.78,1.78,0.59,1.78,7.69,1.78,5.92,0.59,4.73,0,8.88,0,1.18,0,1.18,21.3,6.51,3.55,4.73,6.51,1.18,4.73,2.96,1.78,0.59,0,2.96,0,1.78,1.18,0,5.92,1.78,0.59,3.55,1.18,0,4.14,18.93,1.18,10.65,1.78,3.55,4.73,0,0.59,0,0.59,0,0,0.59,0,0.59,0,0,0,14.2,4.73,1.78,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,5.92,1.18,0

bcaspr,Dealing with yourself after a trigger (rape trigger warning),"I've been working hard these last few years in identifying my triggers, but I'm still not all together in stopping them from ruining my thoughts and ability to feel much besides anger and numbness for days. 

Ex boyfriend contacted me. Told me he got a promotion and then shared a bunch of romantic texted messages his girlfriend sent him and how I never treated him so good. You can imagine how that would have hurt anyone, let alone someone with PTSD. I blocked him. Again. Hopefully I can have the strength to make it forever. 

Then I felt like I'm the reason why my fiance isn't finding success. My ex wouldn't have been where he is today if he were stuck with me and my two kids. This is definitely true about my SO as well. How successful and happy would this man be without me and the burden of these kids? But when I tried to tell him how I was feeling, he said that its ""Just me that thinks this way."" And then deflected my emotions by being rude in a ""playful"" way. So, I numbed up real fast. 

I woke up today angry. My SO has been wanting sex and I have had zero desire for it. In fact, I dont even want him nor my kids nor my dog to touch me. But I am angry when he distances himself and acts like I'm not there. So I snap and yell at the kids to clean the house. SO finally figures out that I'm not feeling good so he comes and gives me a hug. That makes me feel better for most of the day, but I know I'm still not over my trigger yet. 

SO still wants sex tonight. I figure I'd try, but I'm dry as a desert and there is not even a tingle of desire there. His attempts to get me ready only bring physical pain. He detects this and refuses to have sex. I feel like I let him down and am angry with my body for betraying me. It would have been better if he would have just had sex. I could have faked it. But no. Instead I do the weird sleep thing I do when I am experiencing sexual trauma. The same sleep thing that happened with my ex husband that lead to him raping me in my sleep. My SO would never touch me while I was unconscious, but he has needs and took care of them on his side of the bed while I was passed out. I woke up when he finished. Just like I did when my ex husband finished raping me. I feel... I dont even know what. I cannot sleep now. I want to abandon everyone. My kids, my SO, my dog. The rest of my family I have already since abandoned. I want to just live in a camper van in total solitude and be out in the wilderness sitting in hot springs and trout fishing and hiking. That's what I want to do. 

But these people need me and I just dont know how I can keep being these things for them when I am too broken to even just ""be"" for myself.",kerrybeary1985,2019-04-12 00:29:47,1,552,4.85,15.94,76.64,22.95,12.55,12.32,95.83,65.58,23.91,18.66,13.95,0,0.36,3.8,0.54,5.25,3.44,11.23,11.41,9.6,10.87,3.08,19.93,4.35,1.99,2.72,0.36,1.09,7.61,3.62,3.8,0,1.63,0.91,10.51,0.72,0.54,0,4.71,15.4,3.26,2.72,3.8,1.27,1.63,3.8,3.26,0,0.36,2.72,3.44,0.91,1.09,1.45,0,6.88,2.17,1.81,1.45,2.17,0.36,5.25,12.68,1.09,11.96,1.27,4.89,5.98,0.91,0.72,0.54,0,0,0,0.91,0,0,0,0.18,0,13.41,7.97,1.81,0,0,0.18,0,0,1.09,1.99,0.36,0

bcbem1,Yesterday my mum tried to take her own life and I had already had an intense day at work with a mental health client,"I am (f) in my 20s and have long-term post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I work as a counsellor and have done many hours with a few psychologists to overcome the problems, which arose from difficult childhood. Normally I am very kept together and only suffer from quick bouts of deep depression and anxiety. Today, I am not ok. 

I have felt a need over the past week to tell a timeline of my history. I think for most it will be very boring but maybe there will be some people who relate. If you’re one of them, I appreciate the time you may take to read this. Yesterday mum went missing for 6 hours and attempted suicide twice. I was brought into the middle of it during work, 1,500kms away over the phone. I need to debrief and don’t want to traumatize my support network. 

If I could label the struggles in my life they are as follow: parents separation, abusive step-father, neglect in almost every facet of my younger life, bullying, suicidal attempt/ideation, mother with bipolar type 2, sexual abuse, abortion, eating disorder not-specified (anorexia, bulimia and exercise addiction) and drug abuse. My heart is beating hard as I write this. I am going to do this as a timeline. 

My parents were 21 (f) and 24(m) when they had me and separated when I was 2. Dad stuck around in the next suburb, found my step-mother and I stayed with them every second weekend, which was a safe haven. My mother moved in with my step-father, I’ll call him Jim*, also when I was two and he was in our lives until I was 16. He was a security guard and a black belt. Mum had met him at the gym. My mum aspired to muscular and thin, she was an aerobics instructor, had a restrictive diet and basically lived in gym. My earliest memories are being stuck in a gym crèche in the mornings and nights waiting for mum. When I stated Kindergarten I was given a key and would be by myself until 7-8pm alone every day after school. 

We lived an hour outside of a big city in a poor, very small town. Mum was paid $25 per aerobics class while she studied an undergraduate degree – she is intelligent and has an incredible memory. Home was a fibro cottage with a wood fire place and it was often an ice cold place. My stepfather had obsessive-compulsive disorder and he was neurotically clean and organized; not a single drop of water could be left on the side of the sink in the kitchen, nor a crumb on the bench. If I made a ‘mess’ I would be psychologically punished: I would be told to clean up the mess and criticized for the approach I used to clean it, then I would be lectured for up to 45 minutes, round and round in circles, about how I don’t follow instructions, I’m disrespectful/careless/naughty/vindictive for what I had done and I would have something of mine confiscated for a week – like my cd player, skipping rope or tv privileges. Once he confiscated my signet ring and I never got it back. He hated me being a child and over the course of the years I became like Cinderella – which is really cheesy, but it was my reality. I was a live in slave. 

They didn’t have much income and they struggled to get by for many years so food was limited – which I think worked for mum and Jim’s eating disorders. From the age of 5 – 12 I had the same food for school: fruit bar, cheese dip with crackers and a Vegemite (salt spread) sandwich. We ate the same dinner routine each week: grilled chicken breast (no oil, salt or pepper) some rice and frozen veggies. I wasn’t allowed to drink milk because I had once spilt it on the bench. My dad offered to pay for the milkman and that’s the excuse Jim gave him. Dad is harmonious and was scared of Jim, so he never challenged him. I was always hungry at school. My uniforms and underwear would wear out, become dirty or I would outgrow it and I would go without until my dad and step mum would notice; dad didn’t pay child support but and my step mum treated me as much as they could. 

I saw grandparents frequently over the weeks and nan was ultimately the person who provided my clothes and toys. Nan bought me a new toy every time I saw her and while I didn’t have much at home, I had a pretty cool toy collection; it was my everything (particularly as Toy Story had came out, I was emotionally attached to my toys). Jim would give away my toys to thrift shops when I was away at dads. He said I was too spoilt and they needed to go to other kids who needed them more. It broke my nan’s heart to see him throw out toys that had been my mum’s but she never said a word. Jim was authoritative.

My brother was born when I was seven and I became his second mum. When I arrived home from school, mum and Jim would leave for the gym, which was 50 minutes away. I had to look after my infant brother, organize dinner and keep the house warm with the fire. Before my brother was born, I once locked myself out in the cold when getting fire wood, it sucked waiting in the cold. Another time a log had fallen out of the fire as I was trying to prod it in and it burnt the carpet. I got in trouble. They replaced the carpet. My mum would change my brother’s nappy on the carpet on top of a small mat. One time I changed my brother’s nappy, I had to quickly leave the room to put the dirty nappy to soak in the bucket and when I arrived back, he shat all over the new carpet. I knew how to steam clean the carpet with the VAC and did so, but the stain didn’t come out. I got in so much trouble and had my “privileges” taken away: no TV, no music and no going out to friends. 

My family collaboratively bought me a Nintendo 64 for my 8th birthday and fuck, Jim hated that; couldn’t stand to see me enjoy something in the lounge room – I was supposed to be in my room. He banned it all the time. Monday nights became 64 night as mum and I would get it out of the cupboard, remembering exactly where the cords had sat and I would get to play it while he was at Karate, packing it up before he got home. We would have to memorize the TV volume and channel he had left it on. I won’t go into it too much, but at my small school of 100 kids, the three ‘popular’ girls I fourth-wheeled with consistently isolated and bullied me. This is a glimpse of everyday life in my childhood. 

In 2001 mum obtained a job in the desert and at the same time was about to embark on her PhD (doctorate). Jim at this stage had studied landscaping and had a green thumb, so not the ideal place to move if you like gardening. It was awful, being moved 2,000kms away from family who had been a safe haven on weekends for me. My dad was heartbroken but didn’t fight it. I arrived in grade 6 to half way through the year at a new school and I was clearly different to the desert kids. I was really girly, I loved all things pretty (thanks Barbie), while the girls in desert loved basket ball, baggy clothes and bmx. I was bullied, ran away from and ended up having one friend at the whole school. I thought things would improve at high school but they didn’t. The bullying continued.

Things had become increasingly harder at home as I had became a teenager. By this point, I was doing absolutely every house chore: washing and drying dishes, sweeping and mopping the floors, cleaning the toilets and bathroom, washing, hanging and folding everyone’s clothes, taking care of my brother when they were at work or out at the gym, weekly dusting and sharing the cooking of meals with mum. I was still eating a fruit bar, cheese snack and vegemite sandwich for lunch. I was becoming increasingly obsessive with food, starved in brain and also scared it I would get fat. My room had the tallest mirror and mum would stand in it obsessing over her thighs, telling me she was fat. She told me food is fuel, not for fun. Jim also aspired to be lean.  There is so much fucking shit that happened over the course of this time in the desert. I began exercising by running at 5.30am before school, restricting my food after 12pm and exercised at night to burn off my dinner.  Near the end of grade 9, I was always sick, cold and thought about killing myself. One afternoon at school I ate 24 Panadols and a box of fat burner tablets. My plan had been to die on the bus so the girls who had bullied and bashed me would see what they had done. I didn’t make it past the school gate, I was sick and mum was called to pick me up. I told her what I had done and she drove me to a coffee shop because she didn’t believe me. Eventually she took me to the hospital where I was treated and it was proven I had harmed myself. I was released in the middle of the night and she made me tell Jim – who was now sleeping on the couch - what I had done. 

Around this time, in grade 9 I began to hang out with the guys in our grade that were a little nerdy and sporty and it was great. For once, I was accepted and I formed genuine friends, some who I still know today. One of the guys however, lived across the road from my house. He had a granny flat, a pool and his own cash to buy food. We had nice friendship to begin with and once my chores were done I would hang out the front in the gutter with him talking. One afternoon before Jim was home, I had a call from a nurse at the hospital who told me not to worry, mum was fine, but she was in the mental health ward and had tried to commit suicide with pills. She had self-presented at the emergency department. I was told by the nurse not to tell Jim. I went outside and kept talking to the guy across the road. Eventually Jim found out mum was in hospital and I got in trouble for not telling him. The following day I was removed and sent back to my dad’s for 6 weeks. Mum basically dropped out from medical assistance, my brother stayed with her and Jim finally moved to a rental. When I returned from dad’s, mum walked past me in the airport because she didn’t recognise me after ‘the weight’ I had gained while I was away – so the eating disorder kept going. 

I want to set a bit of a trigger warning for the next paragraph as I was underage. 

I fell in love with the boy across the road. It was proximity, he was in the same grade, same school. He was known a funny guy and his mates would often tease him for racing home to use dial up Internet after school, to watch porn and wank before his family got home. I thought it was funny and accepted it was what guy did. We got together in the summer between grade 9 – 10 and within three weeks of dating him I had my first kiss…. within 5 weeks we had sex. Because mum was still working and I was stuck at home every school holidays with my brother, the guy was able to come around as much as he pleased. He would spoil me and my brother with take-away food, because he had his own bank account. I didn’t want to lose my virginity; he pressured me into it by saying I was too scared. He then just wanted to ‘test’ what it would be like to place his penis against me and he pushed in. I took myself to the sexual health clinic and was prescribed the pill. The relationship worked for me for about 10 months: I would go to his after school, he would have sex with me, cum inside me, stay limp inside me for ages and then I would be fed and able to hang out at his granny flat with all his cool shit. He did tried some fucked up shit with me.  At school we clung to each other, he provided food for me, got me a mobile phone and an ipod. He would speak to me for hours each night before bed. Mum thought he was lovely and it meant he could just walk into our house as he pleased. One night he came into my room when mum was cooking dinner and had sex with me so hard on the carpet that I had burns up my back. I broke up with him in the summer of year 11. I couldn’t stand how needy he was and he didn’t want to go to parties, like everyone else was. I broke up with him and approached my last two years of high school with a drive to study and succeed in my grades for university. 

During this period above I also became one of the youngest aerobics class instructors in the country and began following in mum’s footsteps teaching aerobics after work. My brother was old enough to have his own key – thankfully he is doing well today. 

The guy across the road couldn’t accept what happened. He harassed me across the whole year following the break up, would come into my house as he pleased and watched my every move. In October 2006, he raped me. I have never said the R word aloud. There had been a big concert and I had no way of getting home – mum was still unwell and couldn’t pick me up. He offered to take me home but instead he drove me to the oval near homes and for about an hour he cried and begged for sex. I said no and I refused to kiss him. He eventually began driving us home but he persisted to guilt me. I gave in, allowed him to come into my bed where he had sex with me.  He came inside and I was no longer protected by the pill. He left and I pretended like it never happened. I didn’t feel sad, I didn’t think about and I went on with life. It was the last time we slept together. 

In the summer between grade 11 – 12, I was doing really well at school, had friends, was a good aerobics instructor and I had another casual job – but I was sick. I became weak and dizzy; I thought it was to do with my lack of eating and I was proud I had got that far. My period stopped and I thought my anorexia was finally starting to settle in. I thought I was in a happy place leading to death. On the 21st of December, I took myself to the sexual health clinic because I was overcome with a sudden fear that perhaps my period hadn’t come because of what happened with the guy across the road. I was 14 weeks pregnant. I told the nurse not read me my options, that I wanted an abortion and the State was able to process the late stage abortion and terminate the baby before Christmas day. He knew about the abortion and brought me a slice of his dad’s blue birthday cake as a gesture. Noone ever asked me about how I had become pregnant. Mum and her new partner, G, at that time just assumed I had made a mistake. 

In grade 12 (17), I got with my next boyfriend who I would go to uni with and date for three years. During grade 12 the guys across the road broke into my MySpace and Facebook accounts where he photoshopped my head on porn and changed all my profile pictures to me in porn. The school questioned him about it but he denied it. 

I moved away with my new bf, to university and began studying social sciences and lived as the university gym instructor, campus. I developed insomnia soon after I began studying and became mum: I was teaching two gym classes a day. I went to the doctor and was prescribed an unlimited amount of Stilnox – a sleeping tablet that made me trip for a while, followed by sleep. I became addicted and used it as a way to sleep fast, without needing to suffer from starvation at dinner time. I was a high functioning anorexic: starved in the mind but just slender, not thin. My eating and exercise disorder began to takeover and I was admitted to an outpatients program at the hospital where I underwent 40 weeks of cognitive behavioural therapy to treat the eating disorder. My boyfriend and I were growing apart from who we were at high school and we barely sexually active. We broke up in the summer of 2010-11. He was – and continues to be my best friend – but plot twist, he is gay. He kept me safe and loved for three years and it hurt when we broke up and I once again moved away. 

I went to another city in Australia and studied a Masters of Social Work, by this point I had a passion to work in mental health and help others the way I had been helped – but I had a lot more psychology to do. To get by, I was a live-in nanny for a single mother who was a surgeon. I repeated my life growing up: I was her Cinderella and took care of her private school child’s every survival need. I also continued teaching aerobics and I worked in fruit and vegie shop. I was also working on placements for social work and continued a rigorous exercise routine in the mornings. I look back now and wonder how I did it. 

I had moved to city to be with a guy I had met at my first uni. He was nice and supportive, but he also couldn’t control himself and touched my genitals, as I was asleep at night. I asked him to stop but he said he had no control over it as he was sleep. Over the two year we were together, he had his own issues and felt pressured by his parents to do well in pharmacy at uni. We began smoking weed as my unlimited supply of Stilnox was cut off when I moved. I couldn’t sleep. It got to the point where I couldn’t manage life and my placement at uni. I dropped out after completed 1.5 years of my 2 year Master degree. During this time I had been undergoing schema therapy with a new psychologist and I had been labeling and sharing the abuse I had suffered through my childhood. I was so deep in an eating disorder. I had been in an out of hospital for stomach pains that were unexplained and lasted weeks. I engaged in psychgology as I did with every facet of my life and I tried to be the perfect student, by actively taking on the skills and approaches I was learning. I had a light bulb moment during in a session where I realized I could quit the gym, keep exercising and just earn money at the fruit shop. It was the start to the ‘end’ of my eating and exercise disorder. I read I Quit Sugar by Sarah Wilson and learnt about nutrition. I began to cook and experiment with my foods and calorie intake. I also had enough of the 3rd private school bf, broke up with him and moved back to the desert where I felt I could have a break from everything.

I moved back in with mum, my brother and her partner and that lasted 8 weeks. I hooked up with my partner – whom I’ve been with for 5 years now – and I moved in with him. I’ll just say now: he is constantly stable, safe, cares for me, is totally the raddest person I know and is well liked by his friends. He has helped me to repair myself.  I completed a diploma degree in high school teaching and recently a Masters of counselling. I have been counselling at a women’s centre for over two years and I am doing well in my career. When I returned to the desert in 2014 it was hard; one of my boyfriend’s best friends passed away in a terrible accident and the whole friendship circle was impacted. In 2015 I, not my partner so much, chased drugs as those who were grieving around me were using. It was just weekend drugs, I never let it encroach on my strict my weekly routine of work and exercise. But I went hard on MDMA on the weekends and depleted the good brain chemicals. Mid-way 2015 I was listening to Let It Happen by Tame Impala, driving to school, hating my teaching job, hating the smashed broken window in my car I couldn’t afford to fix, raining, once again wanting to kill myself.  

That song made me go to my 3rd psychologist and this time she diagnosed me with PTSD and had me undergo EMDR therapy for my traumatic childhood and teenage years. I made bounds and leaps and became the healed person I am today. I thought I would be able to make a difference in children’s lives by being like the teacher, Miss Honey from Matilda, but it was too hard and I know my strength is listening to and supporting people with mental health problems. 

Throughout this time I haven’t really mentioned my mum’s mental health. She had made a number of suicide attempts over the years using medication and knives. Sometime I was present. Sometime not. She has never wanted to engage with a psychologist, despite how smart she its. She had always been diagnosed with depression and placed on anti-depressants however, she is bipolar and properly diagnosed and medicated after a super depressive episode in 2013. My mother has overcome the exercise disorder also and learnt to relax once she was placed on medication. She went on to do another Masters degree and is a specialist in her field in Australia. She is incredibly passionate at what she does and her level of expertise is in high demand. Bipolar is like a monster though and no matter how well she is going, it eventually rears it’s head when her resilience is down. 

At present, I see a supervisor / psychologist once a month. I have a brilliant workplace who pays for this level of support. I am a healthy, long term, stable relationship with a wonderful person. I have a disordered mindset that requires  80/20 relationship to food exercise and tend to manage it by being balanced through the week with exercise in the morning and healthy foods, followed by nothing on the weekends and take away food. I am really happy with my body overall. Two years ago I underwent a breast augmentation because I had always been ‘flat chested.’ I didn’t enjoy sex because I felt like a pre-pubescent girl in the torso. I have C-cups now, nothing crazy, just normal and I’m now 54kg, which is about 10kg more than when I had weighed for the previous decade. My work is stable, I’ve travelled and I generally have a good life, although I burn out easily through work. 

I work at women’s centre where I counsel women who have been bullied, sexually harassed/assaulted, discriminated against or have lost their job for one of the aforementioned reasons. I work one cases that go for up to year. It is rewarding but it is intense. This week I spent two day at training for how to respond to a sexual assault disclose and I couldn’t help but have flashbacks to what had happened with the guy across the road. I was ok though. I went to work yesterday and during the day I had return client call in distress and crying; she was historically suicidal.  I told my fellow colleague I couldn’t handle it and she took over. I felt guilt and apologized to her at the end of the day. I was feeling really crap and was getting ready to knock off – when mum rang at 5.15pm. 

She called amidst a huge fight she was having with her now husband of 12 years – he too is incredible and I am so sad this is happening to him. She was in a major depressive/suicidal state and had returned to their home after being missing for 6 hours. She had tried to drink bleach and slice her wrists with a razor blade. They moved to a beautiful property that spans for miles along a river. They are remote and 3.5 hours out of the city. There is no adequate healthcare, let alone mental health support. I received the call from mum and she saying she wanted to kill herself; her partner G was on the phone to me and he couldn’t settle her down. Mum was irate and yelling in a pitch that sounded nothing like her. It was like an adult toddler. She slammed the door and he didn’t know if she was once again harming herself. I told them mum needs help. My professional experience would say call 000 and get an ambulance and the police to the property but I knew, historically, she couldn’t kill herself and I would be in trouble for the $2,000 ambulance bill over the weeks to come. I finally had the both of them sit in silence on the phone for 5 minutes and they were able to talk – not before mum had lots of push back and she told me not to medicalizee her. After ages of her wanting to leave to kill herself she finally rested and went to sleep. My step dad told me things were ok and I knew she was safe until the next time.

My legs were shaking as I took the call. I returned home and my partner had organised Thai take away. My housemate allowed me to debrief on bits that had happened with mum. 

But I awoke today and it was a day unlike any other I’ve had. I am 29 now. I have a life of my own and intense but rewarding career, which I manage using very strict personal routine and boundaries. I wasn’t ready for yesterday and it has left me feeling shaken. I have memories bouncing around my mind. I managed to exercise today but I have, of course, used my vice of smoking, drinking and weed to get through the afternoon, as I write this. You don’t think anyone can tell that I live an emotionally disconnected life outside of work. People around me – I think – think I am normal. I am still highly functioning.

Today the wind was taken out of me. I am sad. I am sacred one day I will get the call mum killed herself. I feel like a slave to my perfectionism. I love my partner and my dog, I aspire to have a career and I also disassociate and imagine killing myself. I worry I am like mum in her late 20’s and perhaps I will be like her one day. I am depressed, but just for today. Tomorrow I have plans and commitments and have every intention to follow through but today, I wish I wasn’t alive.",Windy_Milk,2019-04-12 02:08:35,0,4764,57.5,37.56,74.42,20.38,18.47,14.92,91.35,56.3,16.92,13.81,9.59,0.38,0.08,3.34,0.42,3.11,6.15,14.46,9.32,3.63,7.51,1.53,17.95,4.2,1.72,1.41,2.16,1.11,4.64,2.12,2.48,0.44,0.71,0.69,9.8,1.74,0.73,2.52,2.9,7.83,1.64,1.01,1.66,0.86,0.97,2.12,1.89,0.4,0.52,0.8,5.1,0.8,2.31,0.73,1.66,6.53,1.76,1.32,2.25,1.13,0.42,10.18,5.77,0.55,16.58,2.29,7.66,6.86,3.15,1.66,1.01,0.46,0.04,0.36,0.5,0.19,0.06,0.13,0.13,0,11.82,5.42,3.3,0.23,0.19,0,0,0.38,0.17,1.45,0.46,0.23
bcblje,Uncovered a horrible memory,"I finished my PTSD therapy back in January. 
For the most part, my rapist is visible in my every day life and so it was mainly about gaining skills on what / how to behave if I happened to see him (side note: we work in the same office)

It’s been going well. 

Recently however, I have been feeling strange. The other night I was lying in my bed and a memory came from nowhere and it all came flooding back. I was molested when I was younger, by a slightly older female friend. I don’t know where this memory has gone over the years and why it’s come back now but it’s here, and all I can think about is I can’t believe this happened to me. I can’t believe i have somehow forgotten all about it and seemingly moved on and then almost 20 years later it’s back in the forefront of my mind.

What do I do here? I’m scared to tell my parents because of how they reacted regarding my rape (sadness, mainly) because they will look at themselves to blame. 
In my country if you’ve had therapy you’re placed back at the bottom of the waiting list (6 - 12 months). What do I do with this new information? Do I process it for longer and then tell people.

&amp;#x200B;

I have the same night terror every night..  The same screaming wake up in a complete panic..  My next thought is always if i was not alive i would not go through this.. my wife wouldn't hear me scream every night.. my daughters wouldn't see their father sobbing in tears because the thought of going to sleep again scares me to the point Im barely sleeping.. incoherent half the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I got rid of all my guns yesterday. I gave them all to my little brother with instructions to never return them to me. Give them away/sell them/IDGAF..     But I am at the point I was 3 years ago where my self preservation is at a zero and I just don't give a fuck about myself... But I am trying to give a fuck.. I really am trying.. Its very hard and tiring fighting whats going on inside my head for the sake of my daughters.  They don't deserve a father like this.. They need more! 

&amp;#x200B;

Sedatives and Tranquilizers were used on me as I was a child and got older to keep me docile while my abuse happened.. I forced into being a sex worker as a child..  I can't take them to help me sleep as thats what lead to my last suicide attempt.. I say attempt only because the gun jammed.  

&amp;#x200B;

just to be clear so its said.. I am currently safe.  While I want to die yes, I do not have any plans to actively carry it out and I am really really really trying to fight this.

bcecwq,How to identify emotional flashbacks?,"The therapist I'm seeing commented that he thinks I'm experiencing recurrent emotional flashbacks. This is not something I discussed in my previous therapy and I wasn't really aware they were a thing. He explained them as periods during which a mixture of particular feelings (despair, intense fear of abandonment, self-hatred/shame, guilt and anger according to him) are present and disproportionate to a person's environment or situation. He also said that usually there is a feeling of being younger than you actually are (or feelings of being physically smaller) and feeling like you have no way to get out. I'm thrown by this because this sounds much closer to my experience of PTSD than the usual way ""flashbacks"" are described - I was aware that heightened emotional responses were an aspect of PTSD but not in this way. He described regular flashbacks as being primarily physical and based in fear and defense. Conversely, he said people describe emotional flashbacks like feeling like you're drowning in a number of different and sometimes conflicting emotions but there isn't necessarily an intrusive visualisation of the traumatic event and there may be no physical symptoms.

I'm new to this therapist and just want to know if this sounds right? Has anyone else experienced these kinds of flashbacks? How do you know they're about to happen or are happening? It all made sense when he brought all the different feelings and thoughts I was having together but I don't know if I'd ever be able to recognize it on my own.",TinyLittleStormCloud,2019-04-12 07:43:30,8,261,30.81,33.66,84.95,1,21.75,28.35,92.72,56.32,16.09,9.96,4.98,0,1.53,2.68,0.77,6.13,4.21,13.03,11.49,5.36,9.58,2.68,19.92,7.28,4.98,1.53,0,1.15,5.75,0,5.36,1.53,0.77,0.77,9.58,0,0,0,2.68,20.31,6.51,2.3,1.15,3.83,1.53,7.66,5.75,0.38,1.53,2.3,2.68,0,2.68,0,0,2.68,0.77,0.38,0.77,0.38,0.38,4.6,10.73,0.38,11.88,0.77,5.75,5.36,0,0,0,0,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.79,3.07,1.53,0,0,1.53,0,0.77,0.77,4.21,1.53,0.38
bceezq,"So long Executive Functioning, we hardly knew ye!","Going through a numb spell in my PTSD. My body doesn't know what year it is and all my days are bleeding together. I've been in a fog since Christmas - one long stretch of laying in bed devoid of rest or peace. Sleep cycle is an utter joke with nightmares most of the time. I can't remember the last time I didn't wake up in a cold sweat.  My work is suffering, my home is a mess, my hygiene sucks, laundry piled up. I've missed so many appointments the last few months because I lack the energy to do anything, even cry. I caught myself this morning feeling frustrated that my little 1st floor apartment doesn't have a high enough spot to hang from, which is not the kinda intrusive bullshit I need in the morning. 

I want to go back to therapy but in the midst of this fog I lost my health insurance, a whole 'nother wave of self loathing.  I'm hanging on by the Grace of Zoloft and CVS pharmacy. They find you coupons and automatically use them, which is enough for me to stay medicated. It's helping me manage my intrusive suicidal thoughts rationally and I feel like it's holding back a flood gate of self harm and destructive behaviors. So, one point for me I guess. 


Fuck this disease. Fuck my brain chemistry. Fuck my use of negative coping skills over positive coping skills. Fuck my roommate for not helping me clean when he sees me break down weekly about the mess in the apartment.

bceixd,Being in Control of Relationships as an Adult: Saves Childhood Relationships?,"*\[Crossposted to CPTSD\]*

I've had an odd few days. My mother, who I'm estranged from, asked my family and myself to come to her home for Easter dinner. My stepfather's children apparently make the trip each year and this year, my sister is having her daughter a week before Easter Sunday. It's a 5 hour drive from my home to her home. My husband I and I have an 18 month old daughter. My husband doesn't hide the fact that it's not his favorite car trip to make. We also aren't quite as comfortable at my mother's home with her three dogs and my 18 month old in a Pack 'n Play. It's a lot of stress to make the trip.

But I've been thinking a lot lately about my trauma and about how my mother has played a role in my trauma. It took me becoming a mother on my own before I could really even understand *some* of my mother's struggles, but due to the fact that I don't quite trust her, I can't believe all of what she says in relation to many of her struggles. Still, she is my mother, and what do I do? The Libra in me: the 5 year-old in me is a people pleaser and wants everyone to be happy: I want my mother to be happy that I visited and brought her granddaughter; I want my husband to be happy with the trip; I want to be happy and enjoy being with family. It feels impossible to be able to do this all.

But it brings to the front of my mind the age old question: What is my relationship with my mother going to look like as I get older? What am I going to do with the relationship I have with my mother now that I am a 34 year-old adult woman with her own child? These are things that are entirely up to me at this point in life and that I haven't given any thought to. When we're children, our relationships with our parents are dictated by their every move, but as adults ... we have the opportunity to choose the direction our life relationships take. I wonder if going up for Easter extends the olive branch but maintains the message that this relationship is one of control on my side.

Background; I am paranoid because of my trauma, but not the kind of paranoia that nded me think everyone is out to get me, if that makes sense. It's more like a constant feeling of impending doom. 

My boyfriend and I got into an argument last night. I've been scared to leave my house alone because if a feud with our drug addict/dealer neighbours. I told him how they stress me out by making comments through the walls, glaring in my Windows when they walk by, and making rude gestures and comments when I walk part their house. My boyfriend, during the fight, said ""will why do they never do it when I'm around? You've said it yourself that you deal with paranoia.""

I felt so angry and ashamed in that moment. It was like he was using my mental illness to justify his doubt in what I was saying. I know he didn't mean anything by it, but it hurt that his first thought was that because I deal with paranoia, I might be misunderstanding what's ""really going on"". I know my own mental state, and I know what it does to me. I can tell the difference between an auditory hallucination and ask actual conversation going on in the stairwell between the apartments.

bcid4x,Seeking emotional support during a crisis...,"I am a survivor of incestuous, childhood sexual abuse. 15 years since the abuse ended. My husband is the only person that knows about it. 

Over the past week, Things started getting unburied within my family about others being sexually abused (different abuser). My mom is having a very difficult time comprehending everything and is getting a bit paranoid and suspicious of everyone and everything. I have a very hostile relationship with my abuser (my brother) and always have. Now that things are getting uncovered about other people, my mom started getting suspicious, I suppose. 

Last night she texted me and directly asked why I don’t like my brother and if anything ever happened. I didn’t answer the message and haven’t had contact with her since. (Not completely abnormal since we both worked today).

I am certain she is going to ask again. After reflecting on things, I’ve decided all I’m going to say is “if I want to talk to you about something, I will come to you”. I know this will increase suspicion, but I feel uncomfortable directly lying to her. I’ve decided that I can not control anything that occurs revolving this. All I can control is my actions, and I must prioritize my well-being above all. (I recently started therapy to work on this trauma and am in the process of “healing before disclosing”. I have plans to disclose to both of my parents (they’re divorced) but I don’t feel ready in this moment. I’ve also considered some wise advice from my therapist, “you don’t owe anyone an explanation for your actions”. And if she starts to pry, that’s what I will say. 

I can’t control if she freaks out, doesn’t talk to me, or harasses me about it. All I can control is my actions based on what I feel is right for me in this moment.

bcjimj,[TW sexual assault] My therapist made me realise that my cousing assaulted me and i don't know how to feel.,"You know how sometimes something just happens and you never talk about it with anyone, and it just feels like it never happened, like it's not real. 

""Oh yes that happened once its totally fine and normal to have panic attacks when thinking about it""

I never realised that it was a bad thing, until i told her. And i realised how hard it was to talk about it. I realised how horrible it sounded. When i said it out loud, when i heard it, it sounded so traumatic, even though it seemed so mundane and normal to me in my head.

I guess i should give some insight: My cousin is like 26 and a psycho. He raped my aunt, who is 7 years younger than him, when she was a teenager (she's like a sister to me so i want to strangle him)

When i was 12, he barged into our house (my dumbass grandma let him in cause ""he's a wonderful man""). My aunt was there too, trying to get him to leave.

He made a huge scene, started crying because his girlfriend left him or something, telling us how he got into a fight, he was so hurt, he missed us so much. 

He was doing emotional 180s every second, going from crying to shouting to laughing. 

After getting tired of his bullshit my aunt went to take a shower and i was left alone with him on a couch. He started rubbing himself on me, putting his hands everywhere while he whispered something completely unrelated into my ear like we were just having a normal conversation. 

It fucked with me because i didn't know how i should react. Like you have this dude touching you but he's acting like nothing's going on.
I was a dumbass so i just froze and tried to act normal too. I was completely red and embarrased to the point where i thought i was being the pervert for percieving this as sexual. I felt so dirty. 

After that, he told grandma he was going somewhere to pick up a package and needed me to go with him. I tried to say i had homework and that i was busy, but my grandma made me go with him and called me impolite. Again, i thought i was being the rude one.

When we got outside, he dragged me by the hand to a small isolated street, we walked for a while, and we stopped at a delivery van. There was another man there. He said that he had a package for me and i had to take it from the van, because it was all the way to the back. 

I think i made all the excuses in the world and speedwalked the fuck outta there. He was shouting after me, asking me what the fuck i think i'm doing. Luckily, i was close to my house, so he didn't have much time to chase after me. I got to my house, and my aunt hugged me because she was so worried. 

We didn't talk about it after that

When i told my therapist, she made me realised that he was an actual predator, ACTUALLY targeting me. I had other instances of him touching me at family reunions (as alabama as that sounds) And now that i know that it actually happened and it was a bad thing, i don't know how to feel. 

I don't really talk to my family (emotional neglect and occasional abuse) so that was the first time i had an authority figure validate my experiences.  

Sorry if this isn't the right sub, I don't know if this is real ptsd or if i'm just being dumb again, sorry, just needed to type it.  

i hate how he gets away with everything all the time",Alexut-,2019-04-12 15:09:05,13,659,9.88,43.36,52.64,1,19.97,14.57,94.69,63.88,26.4,18.97,11.38,1.21,0.61,5.77,0,7.28,5.01,11.38,8.65,8.95,9.56,1.82,19.88,4.7,2.58,2.73,1.06,1.21,5.77,0.76,5.01,0.46,2.12,1.37,13.51,1.82,0.3,1.97,5.31,12.9,2.88,3.03,1.21,2.58,1.82,2.73,4.1,0.15,1.97,1.82,2.12,0.61,0.46,1.06,0,6.22,2.58,0.76,1.37,1.21,0.46,9.71,7.44,0.46,11.38,1.52,4.4,5.61,0.3,0.3,1.21,0,0,0,1.67,1.06,0.15,0.15,0.15,0,14.42,4.86,5.01,0.15,0,0,0,0,0.61,2.28,1.21,0.3

bckf6y,"My ex is on reddit, he made a sub for a young college girl’s snap nudes.","I kept thinking he would come back to tell me how much he loved me. Like I just kept in my mind that while he is away he would be getting better, getting help, and come back and we would be so happy. We would have the family we talked about.

No. 

He will always like underage teens and college girls. He will always like fat girls with large boobs. Girls with butter faces and with nipple piercings. 

He hadn’t used the account at all in 2 years. He posted for the first time 9 days ago, and every day thereafter. Just saw it. Randomly thought of looking him up. 

I honestly feel like regressing back to cutting and overdosing to where I pass out. I used to have problems with that and I’ve come a long way since then. I am in dbt and it has helped a lot. Stupid me though coped through the trauma he caused me by thinking he would change and tell me he still loved me. No, he never fucking loved me. God damnit I am so fucking DUMB. And there were so many MUCH MORE SERIOUS INSTANCES where it was obvious he didn’t love me- like when he didn’t contact me when I was going through the anniversary of our miscarriage. That’s kinda obvious, duh. But no, some naked young girl that looks 15 being plastered all over his account is what does it for me. Why am I so fucking stupid. He made this sub just for her. 

Why is she better than me? :( She is way better than me. He never plastered me on his social media. He never showed how much he loved me. He shows his love for this girl though. He is promoting her snapchat and posting for her. Why didn’t he ever strangle her? Why didn’t he hit her? Why me? Why was I the one he hated. She must be way better.

TWs for SA &amp; kidnapping &amp; drug use 

i was 17 and already considered “at risk” (addicted to multiple drugs and extremely unstable). i was dating a 21 year old i met online. he convinced me my parents were emotionally abusive. my parents are and never were. i just believed him and i don’t know why. i was really naive. i took a greyhound bus to his place when i found out (my psychiatrist told me for some reason) that my parents wanted to send me to wilderness therapy (i did end up doing this still). it was really bad. i won’t go into the SA details but he made me change my hair color and take out my facial piercings. he said there are posters of your face everywhere and if you leave the house a cop will pick you up and i’ll be arrested for harboring a minor. he locked me in a cellar when the cops came the first time. i only left once in 5-6 days and it was in his friends car and they were changing my hair color. i think he believed he was helping me but my therapist says a lot of his behavior said sex trafficking too like him giving me drugs and then saying i owed him and planning a trip to NYC right after and it’s just confusing. i feel like it’s my fault for making the choices that got me there.

She said that she thought I was emotionally hypersensitive, like highly sensitive but a step above that. And that may have caused me to be more susceptible to developing PTSD. I went through some bad stuff, but some people go through trauma and get over it so much easier. I've been doing EMDR for 5 years, I'm a lot better, but still not recovered.

I have to avoid soaps and candles that once reminded me of my favorite season, because they give me flashbacks.

Until today I guess. I smelled my parents soap, ""Crisp Fall"", and smiled, picturing a beautiful fall day in my head.

bcpd9t,Formally diagnosed with PTSD this week,"Let me say first that I have narcolepsy, so my sleep doctor is also a psychiatrist. I've been seeing her for a year and a half, and it's taken me that long to trust her enough to open up. It also helped that I finally found the right antidepressant, which has stabilized my depression and anxiety enough to start talking about the horrific things that I went through. 

She already knew about the physical, psychological, and emotional abuse that I experienced growing up. That is another story in itself. 

I think I first realized on my own that I have PTSD a couple of years ago. Someone sneaking up on me, sudden loud bangs, or someone yelling at me would startle me and trigger flashbacks and it's been that way for at least 15-20 years ( I'm getting ready to turn 32). 

When I was 18 I went to a very crowded college bar with a friend and somebody started shooting. I couldn't see the person shooting, but the panic that ensued is etched in my mind forever. People were pushing to get out the doors and knocked other people over and trampled them. I tried to grab a girl's hand that had fallen on the floor but I was being pushed so hard toward the door that I couldn't hold on to her. It seemed like everything was in slow motion at the time, but I don't think it was longer than a minute until I was out the door. 

That experience has always been hard to talk about, but still not as difficult as what I'm about to share. My psychiatrist is the first person I ever actually told, I haven't even opened up to my husband or my mom about this. Telling my psychiatrist that I was sexually abused by my step brother for 4 years is the hardest thing I've ever talked about in my life. 

I pushed that trauma so deep inside and tried to get my mind to forget. Once I opened up though, the floodgates opened and now I'm trying to cope with all of my emotions. Ever since I opened up on Monday, I have been filled with anxiety and  some depression which has led to me missing 3 days of work. 

I want to open up to my husband soon, and eventually my mother. I'm afraid to open up to my mother because she's dealing with her own depression right now and I know that telling her about my ex step brother will devastate her. She's going to blame and punish herself even though she had no way of knowing. 

I'm so exhausted, I've barely had any sleep this week. I keep having flashbacks and dreaming about the things that I went through. I think that just getting some sleep would help tremendously.",SecretZebra4238,2019-04-13 03:58:20,2,478,31.71,24.49,97.34,1.01,19.12,15.06,92.47,60.25,22.38,14.44,11.92,0,0,2.3,0.21,7.95,4.6,15.48,9.83,6.9,7.32,1.26,19.46,3.14,1.46,0.84,2.3,1.46,4.81,0.63,3.97,1.05,1.05,1.05,9,1.46,0.21,3.14,0.84,9.83,2.09,0.84,1.05,2.3,1.46,2.72,2.51,0.42,0.63,1.05,2.51,0.84,1.26,0.21,0.21,6.69,1.46,1.46,2.51,1.05,0.42,6.69,9.83,0.84,19.25,3.14,9.21,7.11,0.84,0.42,0.63,0,0,0,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,12.34,5.02,3.14,0,0,0,0,0.21,0,3.56,0.42,0

bcrc3b,Need Advice on How to Be a Better Source of Support,"Sorry for the long read. And for the formatting; I’m on mobile. So, I’ve been with my partner for nearly a year and a half now. I knew very early on that he very clearly has PTSD along with a couple other mental disorders. I was also very open about my own struggles with anxiety and MDD when he asked. He actually helped me seek out proper treatment, which I’ll forever be grateful for. I’ve always made it a point to support him through his rough days in any way I can, whether it be offering a listening ear or giving him space to chill. I will admit I began to pry after a while, but I know to back off when he asks me to. I had basically thought I had a good idea of what his triggers are and what coping mechanisms he prefers to use. However, some things have changed over recent months. We’ve been living together for almost 6 months now, which has been amazing. I’m having a great time living life with my best friend. But things have begun to take some turns recently, and I’m not sure how to proceed. One night, he (drunkenly) opened up about several things in his past that have contributed to his PTSD. While I was shocked to say the least, I listened to his stories without offering any sort of commentary (because, honestly, I don’t believe it’s my place). But this has sort of become a common occurrence. We’ll both just be hanging out together, binge watching some show, and having some drinks. But then, something just... happens. He becomes a different person. He’s angry, resentful, downright mean. He rants about everything he’s been through as though it happened yesterday. When this happens, I usually sit back and let him pace the floor and get it out of his system while I’m just silent and listening. It usually works and he calms down quickly and apologizes for being so loud or rude. But I’m getting pretty worried. I have a pretty extensive knowledge of psychiatric disorders and the care and treatment they require due to my job. But I know that I’m no therapist. I also know that it would be way more beneficial to talk to someone who he isn’t personally involved with (not to mention someone who’s actually licensed to diagnose and treat). I’ve offered to find him any kind of help and pay for whatever it may be. He refuses. He always just says “I’m handling it in my own way”. One night, he basically told me that the suffering is his punishment, which is just downright heartbreaking. So my question to anyone who may take the time to read this is just... what can I do? I get so worried when he’s here by himself late at night (I work overnights) and he goes into this dark place. I know continually pestering about seeking help would do no good and would cause him more stress. I just want to know how to continue to be supportive from people who may be going through something similar to what he is. Or if anything I’m already doing is counterproductive.

bcrdfx,15th Anniversary symptoms (possible triggers),"Hi,

So, I am going through the 15th anniversary of one of my major traumas. I have complex ptsd and so much is coming to the surface right now, reality is becoming strained. I guess I am looking got outside input and, as supportive as my family is, they have run out of steam. I’m trying not to be resentful about that since they are largely and collectively responsible for my ptsd. Some of them are responsible in small ways through inaction and some through larger ways by action, but I have healed enough to see that clearly.

I guess to give background, 2 mentally ill parents, didn’t know what mental illness was until 15 when I started getting sick, so until then, it was very hard to process their illness. Got hospitalized and sexually assaults in the hospital. I would say I am just coming to terms with that now, but it is still a process.

I am working on processing a lot of other abuse in my life too, but it is hard to figure out what was abuse and what wasn’t sometimes. I do have a manipulative father who implanted thoughts in my head at a young age like skepticism in recovered memories, probably to keep me from ever talking against him. Knowing that and getting past it are interrelated, but still not the same thing...especially when you are a psych student and know that some memories never come back.

I am terrified of talking about my traumas to people because of the shame, guilt and causing pain to the people closest to me(my family). As we were talking I started slipping away from reality. I couldn't hear her talking to me, panic started setting in and the world just seemed to slip away. It's as if a part of my brain takes over that I have no control of and I'm taking a backseat to reality. 

I have no idea how I got home and I've spent the last two days in a constant state of numbness only broken by episodes of hyperarousal,  hypervigilance, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts of self harm. I've keep my traumas a secret for so long I dont know how I'll ever be able to talk to my family about them. 

How can I heal when I'm so terrified of the process? 
Do any of you experience this after therapy sessions and how do you handle it? 

This is my first time posting and I want to say a huge thank you to every one in this sub for your posts. I wish that none of us had to experience the things we have but I'm  so grateful for a community of people that understands what living with PTSD is like. This is my small attempt to talk about what I'm going through so please forgive the lack of detail.",IlliaMaeMae89,2019-04-13 08:59:19,9,280,50.67,47.14,72.8,1.91,20,18.57,92.5,59.29,19.29,14.64,11.07,1.43,1.43,0.36,0.36,4.64,5,18.93,8.57,6.79,8.21,1.79,17.5,5,3.21,2.5,1.43,2.14,6.43,1.79,4.64,1.79,0.36,0,10.36,0.71,0,0.36,0,8.57,2.5,2.5,1.79,1.07,1.07,0.71,2.14,0,0.71,0.71,2.86,0.36,2.5,0,0,6.79,2.5,0.71,2.14,1.07,0.36,3.21,11.79,1.43,12.5,1.79,5,5.71,0.71,0.71,1.07,0.36,0,0,0.36,0.36,0,0,0,0,10.71,4.29,1.79,0,0,0.71,0,0,0,3.21,0.71,0
bcs3w3,The loss of my wife to cancer 5 years ago traumatized me. A subsequent breakup has made the pain even worse.,"My wife died on December 31, 2013. She was a wonderful woman who I loved deeply. She had cancer and died 18 months after her diagnosis. At the time my children were 2.5 years old and 4 years old. I mourned her, and felt alone and sad and angry. All the things that you feel when love and life are taken from you, and when you were deeply happy and content. I started to work out very intensely, having already been a college athlete, and began to swim and train for triathlons. I became a minimalist in reaction to her loss. I stopped taking photos of the children. I started referring to my parents by their first names rather than Mum and Dad, and I became more distant from my sisters and their families as it reminded me of what I had lost. 

I began going on the occasional date on Tinder about 8 months after she passed. It was always one date, and I was never interested in seeing the person again. I never spoke of my kids or my wife. I just wanted to talk to someone normally for a night. And certainly I was not interested in sex. I did become more serious in the Fall, as I met someone on a business trip. She was 23, I was 38 at the time. I was still living in denial at the time. I told her on the first date about my wife dying but did not talk about my kids. We began a long-distance relationship, she living 3 hours away. I told her about them two months into dating, she cried in my arms and we had sex. After 4 months I introduced her to the kids, and the first thing my daughter said was “is this our new mother” I was not that serious about it at first, I was too wounded. But in June 2015 we broke up, and I went and told her that I loved her. From then we embarked on a more serious relationship, culminating with her moving to my city in July 2016. She had basically moved in. We had plans to get engaged, and she asked for and got a “pre-engagement ring” in November 2016. But in January 2017 she walked out after a disagreement over a job offer I had in another city. We broke up in May 2017 after a hard 5 months. I ended it, but only after I had been lied to, my kids hurt, and my heart broken. My therapist, who had worked with her and me together, said she had Borderline Personality Disorder. And deep anxiety from her relationship with her mother that was badly broken. 

Losing her was harder than losing my wife. My kids were older now and they understood we were different as a family. I felt heartbroken for them. My son had started to call her mommy, she had told them she wanted to adopt them. I went into a deep depression. I like the first time with my wife, my appetite for work stopped, I could not eat, I was devastated.

I sought comfort in other women. I went on dates with 6 women in 7 nights, i had sex with 3 or 4 of them within the first 3 dates. which was totally unlike me. I was reckless. The summer of 2017 was a horrible summer. My ex and I were still talking - she had moved on very quickly with another guy. I had been dumped, I felt abandoned. I could barely function at work. I had different women come in and out of my life and none could compare to the sense of peace I had with my ex. 

In September 2017, I met someone on Match.com. The similarities to my ex were startling: same age, same vocation, both rode horses, fathers with the same name, both the eldest in their families, both pretty and organized. She flew out for a weekend, and we had an immediate connection. But the thing is that I was desperately unhappy when we met. I had started a new job that paid well but I hated, I felt so alone. I was not well and not over my ex. I was looking for someone else to make me whole, as I was not well. And I rushed everything - telling her I loved her, asking her to move to my state, etc. I was unhinged. Over the past 1.5 years, I have looked for this beautiful person to make me whole, to solve for the pain from my ex and my wife’s passing. And she can’t. She loves me and the kids with all her heart. But it is not enough because I have not healed and I don’t know how. And I have started to push her away despite loving her. I’m confused. I’m now 42, about to start an incredible new job, and yet feel totally lost with what I’m doing and what to do about her and the direction of my life.",Awaytto,2019-04-13 09:13:09,1,867,45.61,58.22,93.28,5.8,13.55,12.23,94.35,58.94,21.34,17.88,11.07,1.15,0.35,4.27,1.04,3.46,5.07,14.42,8.07,4.04,6.92,1.61,17.53,5.42,2.88,1.15,3.92,1.5,6.92,2.54,4.38,0.58,0.35,2.19,16.49,2.31,0.46,6.23,0.46,8.65,1.85,0.81,0.81,1.38,1.04,3.23,2.54,0.69,0.46,1.27,3,0.35,1.5,0.35,0.23,8.07,4.27,2.08,0.92,0.46,0.81,12.8,4.04,0.46,18.92,2.42,7.15,9.46,1.27,0.81,0.35,0.23,0,0.46,0.92,0,0,0,0.35,0,14.07,7.5,4.84,0.12,0,0,0,0.46,0.46,0.69,0,0
bcspd2,"It’s only been a few days, but need to vent about what happened *trigger warning* (NSFW)","I just need to put this somewhere and let it all out. I know I can’t *technically* have PTSD unless you’re still displaying symptoms 1 month post-trauma, but  having a really hard time coping with it all. I know I can’t think about all the ‘what if’s’ but it’s so fucking hard not to..

My life was changed the morning of Wednesday April 10th, 2019. I am not the same person I was prior to the explosion, and it’s so fucking sad/scary/idek how to really describe it.. I was kind of a mess of a person before everything happened. Super fucking anxious and the weirdest ambivert. I avoided eye contact and got spooked easily and idk man people just make me nervous and it gets even worse in social settings. I’ve been on SSRIs for years and have seen multiple therapists and have honestly just been dealing with the highs and lows of mental illness. I’m just a research technician in an academic lab, enjoy my quiet work days and just keep to myself, while helping my bosses and post-docs with whatever’s going on that week. 

I’ll try to keep it short, but there was a natural gas explosion directly across the street from our vivarium right after my boss and I finished an experiment. As soon as he opened the door, jokingly said ‘Hmm it smells like gas. Best walk briskly so we don’t get blown up!’ I saw the construction workers across the street crowded around where I occasionally park when running late. I have a HORRIBLE sense of smell, so I was taking in the air, trying to remember what natural gas smelled like. Continuing down the sidewalk, I remember saying, ‘good thing you’re here because you know I can’t smell, I wouldn’t have had a clue!’ 

There were 2 seconds left on the crosswalk; knowing he’s a stickler with the rules I quickly paused as I watched my boss step into the road, speed walking through the white lines of the intersection. As soon as we crossed the street.. BOOM!!! 

It was almost an out of body experience, the whole thing really. The shock wave from the explosion pushed us down the sidewalk, I felt it go through my body and down the sidewalk in front of me. All of the windows outside the building next to us instantaneously shattered, raining down on us and into our eyes.. I remember looking at my boss as he screamed at me to run. 

My ears.. it was like a tornado had just ripped through my head.. then then the pounding and ringing started. I turned around to see what was going on.. the amount of fire and smoke and debris everywhere and people screaming was unreal. Meanwhile we had coolers full of tissue from our experiment, glass in our eyes and didn’t know what else was going to happen. After made it down the block and around the corner to our office building we were just screaming ‘WHAT THE FUCK’ at each other out of shock.

People starting to come outside the building to see what has happened.. as my boss was dealing with everyone outside, I ran up the stairs to grab saline from my desk on the other side of the building to rinse the glass out of my eyes. All of the employees in the building were trying to go see what happened as I was running by them repeating ‘don’t go outside there was a natural gas explosion.’ I remember the confused look on their faces..

It’s so fucking hard processing it all. Normally I’m by myself in the vivarium, and walking those two blocks between my 2 buildings is a normal, daily routine for me. If we had finished our experiment a minute later, or stayed at the crosswalk, or happened to walk at a slower pace.. it’s so fucking terrifying. I’m so fucking lucky to be physically okay for the most part. I have minor damage to my ears, but mentally I am a wreck.. 

Begging our colleagues not to call an ambulance to take us to the ER.. waiting in the car while our coworker navigates the streets as they’re being blocked off by police, black smoke filling the sky, power-walking through the hospital to get to occupational health to get medical attention.. it’s all so vivid. I remembered seeing people in the coffee shop I walked past every day.. I broke down...

It’s only been 4 days, but it feels like it’s been an eternity. I didn’t sleep the first night. I can barely eat. My body is so weak and sore, it takes so much energy just to put one foot in front of the other. Taking life hour by hour, minute by minute because I now have triggers, and since this is all so new it’s fucking terrifying and sad when it happens...

I do have a good support system. My lab and my PI have been incredible during this, including my direct supervisor that I was with when this happened. I live with my boyfriend and our dogs, and his family is close. My family has been doing the best they can although they are a few states away. The occupational health team and particularly the psychologist have been so helpful. 


But at the end of the day no one knows what it was like. To be so close to death, and come out somewhat unscathed? To have such a strange series of coincidences happen? It’s all so surreal and yes I’m extremely thankful to be alive, but the survivors guilt immediately crept in. I’m a trained BLS instructor, and I just ran.. I understand there was nothing I could do to save anyone, but I still feel so much guilt and shame.. 

I just needed to get it all out. Advice on moving forward is welcome/appreciated. 


RIP Mr. Lee, and condolences to the Kaffeinate family.

bcu4qx,My neighbor is most likely faking ptsd and saying I (I actually have ptsd) am triggering her.,"Some backstory: So to begin I'll mention I went through a lot of trauma as a kid and didn't realize how manipulative and cruel the person who caused that trauma was until a few years ago. Repressed memories started to come to the surface a few years ago. I remembered that I was sexually abused (always kind of knew that but it became more obvious in my mind) and I remembered a few other even more horrible things that happened over the years that really fucked me up. After these memories started to flood back I actually started to feel better. I knew what was keeping me from connecting closely to my partners in the past and I started to heal (of course this kind of stuff never heals completely) and I reached a point where I was ready to try dating again. I met the woman of my dreams and we have been together for two years happily and healthily. We moved into an apartment together late last year and things were going well enough (shitty loud neighbors but we live in a campus area so its a given. Some of my trauma comes from my dad yelling at and fighting with my mom and me so occasionally the noise gets to me but I deal alright. I don't get triggered too easily even considering all the shit I've gone through).

So now the first term we live in the apartments go by and the downstairs party neighbors move out and we have no one downstairs for another term which was nice. Then the trouble starts. New neighbors move in. We hardly see each other at all so no impression to get about what kind of people they are. 

That is until they start partying AFTER ten at night. The lease we all signed says very specifically not to get loud after ten and they know that since they signed it too. I wouldn't care except this isn't the weekend. Its wednesday night and I have to get up early for work. So I complain to the management by filling out a complaint form because that's what they want us to do (they said never to confront the neighbors, just fill out a  complaint or call the non emergency police). Then it happens again, and again, and again. They have loud parties usually more than once a week and almost always middle of the week, not on the weekends and it would start at ten (almost on the dot) and often go well past midnight. Not just parties either, sometimes they just talk at full volume in the room directly under our bedroom. Not muffled conversations, I mean ""holy shit how can I hear you that clearly through the floor"" loud conversations on weekdays after ten.

 So sometimes I would complain sometimes I would ignore them and sometimes I called to file a noise complaint with the police. I'm not a big fan of getting the police involved since they need my name in a report and eventually that means the neighbors would know who was complaining if it went to court. So months go by and then a month ago they fall silent. Apparently the management posted the second warning and said if they had to post a third they could legally kick them out. So that's great news except for one thing...

I was reading through my emails the other day and apparently a month ago when the neighbors went silent the management emailed me and attached an email from the downstairs neighbors (management wanted to speak to me about the email the neigbors sent). The email from my neighbors stated that they are never unreasonably loud (thumping bass and music so loud I can clearly hear the lyrics and screaming at the top of their lungs isn't loud? News to me)

It also said that my dog barks all day and that that (in the neighbors words) triggers her ptsd at night (wait what? My dogs daytime barking causes her fits at night?)
I have cameras that clearly show her sitting around bored and ignoring neighbors coming and going all day every day. Pretty much the only times she barks is when I'm home and even then she does it a few times and stops and she doesn't bark late at night since she goes to bed around 8 o'clock. I'm no hypocrite though, there are times when her barking scares the crap put of me because of how sudden and loud it is.

That isn't everything though, she also claims that we are too loud despite the fact that we don't stay up late most nights, have no friends to party with, never turn our music up loud (not even a good stereo system, just the tv), and I'm actively paranoid about being too loud (I constantly adjust the volume when watching tv for this reason much to my partners annoyance but she understands although sometimes she just takes the remote from me lol) due to my fears of other people complaining and getting me kicked out. Not to mention I actually care about other people and genuinely don't want to bother anyone.

The neighbor states in almost exactly these words that ""if it doesn't bother me why should it bother my upstairs neigbors"". So not only is she thinking only about herself but she knows we're the ones complaining somehow, even though her apt shares three walls and a ceiling, somehow she knows who is complaining which probably means the management has been showing them my emails too. There is more to the email but based on everything she said to the management I'm almost certain she's full of shit and pretending to have an issue (ptsd) she knows nothing about to get what she wants.

We're taking steps to move out and away from these toxic people but for now at least they are quiet.

So in conclusion my neighbors are loud, mean, self involved and most likely pretending to have ptsd. Thank you for reading this and letting me vent.",Deelaxation,2019-04-13 12:20:29,4,1032,39.4,55,89.38,11.85,24,16.09,94.09,57.17,17.44,11.43,6.1,1.36,0.19,2.03,1.74,6.01,6.78,12.31,6.4,8.82,8.53,2.62,16.18,3.78,1.74,1.84,1.26,2.52,6.1,2.52,3.59,0.48,1.36,0,13.08,0.19,1.55,2.23,0.1,14.83,2.52,1.65,1.45,3.49,2.42,4.07,3.39,0.39,2.91,0.1,1.36,0.58,0.58,0.19,0,7.75,4.07,0.48,1.84,1.26,0.29,4.46,10.47,0.97,19.28,2.23,7.75,9.4,1.36,1.16,1.94,0.1,0.1,0,0.97,0.58,0.1,0.1,0.19,0,11.14,4.07,1.55,0.1,0,0.29,0,0,0.39,2.23,2.52,0
bcudea,My ex fiancé keeps messing with my emotions,"I was diagnosed with PTSD in May 2018, and I'm in counseling for it while we work on finding me a psychiatrist who can prescribe me something other than Zoloft. However, I'm still losing my shit..

I left my ex back in March and moved in with my aunt. He almost got our baby taken from me because he was addicted to drugs. He tried a million times over to get me back, and I was working really hard on moving on, so I started blocking him on everything. He passed his next DHR drug test, and seemed like he was doing really well, so I unblocked him Tuesday and offered to help him go get the parts he needed to fix his car after he messaged me on Snapchat. When I took him back home, we started talking about everything. We slept together, and then talked some more. He fed me all kinds of bullshit about how he wants to stay sober for me and the baby and how he doesn't want anyone but me and wants to work on getting our family back together. I was seeing another person at the time, but I wanted to get back with him because we've been together for 5, almost 6 years and I love him so much.

Well, I went over to his house Thursday and we slept together again. He was hugging me and kissing me, called me ""babe"" and stuff. I got the feeling he wasn't being honest, so I admit I snooped through his phone because I just had to know the truth and he just lies when being confronted. He had been talking to another woman, was ignoring my calls the day before because he was seeing her, and had her nudes saved to his phone. He got angry with me when I ran out of there crying, he says he was only talking to her because I was still technically in a relationship with my now ex boyfriend, and he only talked to her as a rebound in case I didn't want to get back together. I confessed everything to my ex boyfriend and broke up with him, I felt like it was the right thing to do.

Now, my ex fiancé is doing this thing where he tells me to call him but then he won't answer. He won't answer my messages on Facebook. I know he's online because it shows him getting on and off Messager. I called him 20 times in a row last night because he told me to call him when I got off work.. He finally answered and yelled at me the whole time, telling me this is all my fault and I'm doing this to myself, not giving a straight answer on if he still wants to be with me, telling me to call him tomorrow because it was late.

I messaged him today, begging him to block me because I can't trust myself to leave him blocked. He answered a couple of times but is now ignoring me and refuses to block me for some reason. He knows I'm driving myself crazy over this, he knows I was getting over him and he drug me back in and now, I'm reattached to him and he knows it. I know I'm being toxic and I know I'm letting him play me like this but I can't stop. I want to stop so fucking badly but I won't let myself. He's stringing me along and I don't know what to do. 

tl;dr: my ex fiancé keeps bouncing back and forth between telling me to call him and ignoring me. I begged him to block me but he refuses to do so.",atomicrae,2019-04-13 12:42:49,0,631,10.92,64.24,61.94,14.77,21.03,13.47,94.93,64.66,27.58,23.93,13,1.11,0,9.83,0,3.65,2.38,13.47,8.08,6.97,9.83,1.58,19.81,2.22,1.27,1.43,0.79,1.58,4.12,1.58,2.38,0,0.95,0.48,20.6,0.63,0.48,0.95,9.51,11.41,3.33,1.9,1.43,1.43,0.95,3.01,1.58,0.48,0.63,0.48,2.54,0.63,1.43,0.32,0.16,9.19,3.96,0.95,1.74,2.06,0.79,8.24,8.87,1.58,14.74,1.74,7.13,7.13,0.95,0.63,0.48,0.16,0.16,0,1.9,0.48,0.16,0,0.32,0,12.52,4.91,3.96,0.16,0.16,0,0,0,0.32,3.01,0,0
bcv9ti,Finding my dad messed me up,"I found him after a week after he died, in his apartment in the middle of summer. Not a nice sight, at all. He was the only person in my life who showed me kindess and love and I felt like I betrayed him somehow. I should have checked on him earlier.

It's been a year and I have intrusive thoughts about violently ending my life whenever I get anxious. It's like my brain is trying to calm me down by saying that I have a way out by ending my life but all it does is freak me tf out because the thoughts are so gory. I also obsess about how other people's corpses look a week after death, constantly googling dead bodies. I have started grinding my teeth while sleeping which feels gross, and sometimes i dissociate for days in a row, where it's like I'm in a dream 24/7.

bcw2et,"TW: I feel like the only person in my life, is purposefully triggering my PTSD so I end it, and make their life easier.","When you are struggling, people tell you to ""reach out"", but I don't really have anyone. I've been isolated for years. Most people I know are users, mentally ill, and there's only one person in my life that I care about.

I am really low right now. 

Growing up, whenever I mention anything bad happening to me, my Mother always blamed me for it. She would throw self help books at us, instead of actually stopping the abuse or helping. 

My sibling does something similar, but can't see it.

I've ran into a string of bad jobs after my Mom died. Was sexually harassed at the first job by a predator who saw how vulnerable I was, and the other two were toxic workplaces. 

I left those jobs, and each time I did, my siblings attitude changed toward me immediately. When I had a job, I was ""on the right path"", and if I lost it, I was just ""negative, and not trying hard enough"".

A friend said I should stop messaging him, but I have no one else in the real world. 

I just don't want to be here anymore, and the one person I was staying for, so I wouldn't mess up their life, doesn't care...doesn't have the capacity to care about me or anyone else.

I don't bother him very often, I just message a bit, and try to keep it upbeat, but I don't know if they realize I reach out when I'm [unsteady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFjryf8zH_M) and actually need a bit of emotional support.

I rarely ever get that emotional support. It's like speaking with a robot. I have severe PTSD, and hearing ""self-help"" phrases when I am low and clinging to life, is a major trigger and they keep doing it.

I can't deal with another person in my life being a toxic person. A therapist that requires a ton of $$$ per hour wouldn't be helpful to me right now either. 

This was our string of messages from today:

Them: you have trouble with moving on.
its whats hurting you in business ans life
mine has been comittment
and finsihing what i started
thats why im hete
here
to change that

Me:
Yes, it's true. 
Just tired.

Them:
its okay to be tired. are you tied enough change it though?

Me: 
Phrases like that aren't helpful for me.

Them:
i sent you that link
did you do anything with that?

Me: Also the tone that ""i'm not trying hard enough"" doesn't help.

Me: I am burnt out.
I sent a response to you or a link.
You can read it there.

Them:

im not the best with words
so how i say things may come off wrong
but the heart that im saying them with is with lobe

Me:
I already read that.
Ok.
I've just had enough of phrases and self help books.
Makes me feel like no one cares.

Them:
we have to make people care. there were people with terrible life stories maybe similar or possibly worse, but we didnt even know them to begin to care
Me:
I don't have the energy to 'make people care'.

Them:
the reason why these books were made arent for some greater than thou nonsense, the books are there to leave the answers behind even when people die
the audiobook i sent you will solve your financial issues without a doubt. but because you dont like self help books, and dont see it in that way, it can not help you much
have you ever read a good book, and got something new from it that you didnt see before?

Me:
I've listened to that book

Them:
youre a little wiser, and changed, could ot be that something youve heard or read before may have greater meaning to you?
what i know os that if i were tired, AND desired to end that struggling through whatever means i could, listening to something for a few hours would be too easy to pass up.

you may see my life and say ""i dont see it in your life"". but checkout the people it has helped. look up reviews, or however you determine value
its not about the book beong worth the time princess. its a out you being worth the time
about you
worth seeing if ""this will improve things"" give me a different set of tools or help me deal with stuff
but if you have your own way of doing things, and this isnt something you care to do, no one can stop you, but you may still be tired even years from now

Me:
I've already listened to the book.
Why do you keep ignoring that?
So, if I've listened to the book, and am not fixed yet, it's my own fault.
Because that's what comes next on the self help bandwagon.
Let's agree to disagree on this.

Me:
I am tired of fighting, and exhausted. I need actual help, and have invested my time/energy into people who are callous and unwilling or unable to return that favor. Or conveniently dead. I'm not going to be ""fixed"" overnight. Not to worry, I will not upset you further with these issues.

Them:
have you ever thought that ive felt the same way before?

Me:
How would I know what someone doesn't say?

Them:
i think whats going on, is that there are core issues that are really at work here. unwillingness to work with others and be vulnerable.

Me:
I've been ""working with others""
I've been vulnerable
Has not worked or helped.
I feel like I'm talking to an HR person.

Them:
why didnt you work with me?

Me:
In which ways?
I tried to find the jobs

Them:
i was in the position you are in now, and i triee to work with you but you were too scared or something

Me:
In that time, I was occupied mentally.
*Terrible job* takes up so much of your time
It's close to being an addiction.
And you live/breathe for it. Everything else is a blur.
Until it's cut off

Them:
our **had an addiction too, but it was still painful for more than just himself

Me:
I see that.
But it's not the same exact thing.
I just needed to use the time to find a normal job.
No more businesses or ventures

Them:
why are you so defensive? what if someone called you out on bs and worked with you to get better?
could you handle it?

Me:
I've been to therapy.

Them:
or would you rather ""do it your way""

Me:
and I'm not ""being defensive""
Just being honest.
But it sounds like you already have an idea of what I'm going to say.
I am ""defensive"" and ""set on doing it my way"", and ""unwilling to work with others"".
If I am to be fired, give my last check now, don't send it in the mail.
I'm exhausted, it's not about ""doing it my way"", I don't care about any of that, and it's like you are talking about a stereotype of me, versus the actual person.

Them:
listen, check out that audiobook when you get a chance
im not thw best person to talk about this with because i was there

Me:
OMG?
the whole time
I listened ot that book
The whole thing, before.
You keep ignoring that why?

Them:
and what did you do with what you heard?

Me:
One day,

Them:
ots not a fiction story like nancy drew

Me: if you are every low.

Them: its a manual

Me: I hope someone just keeps pushing a book on you.
and ignoring everything else.

Them: ill ttyl
you never cared

Me: I did care
Or I wouldn't ahve been here
Making sure you were settled or in a better place. What a joke.
It's like talking to a chidl, waste of time.

Them: not really. youre just scared and enjoy being angry and you love being tired

Me: Glad you got on the lifeboat.

Them: it makes you feel good to be blameless

Me: and got out.

Them: stay that way then
bye

Me: Stay that way?
Keep pretending that you know better.
You are a lot like our mother, when something bad happens to someone you shun and blame them.
If they had only read the book or read the bible, that wouldn't have happened to them.
Life is easier, when you stay in the house, or jump in the lifeboat.
Or you are actually trying to drown me.
Just to make your life easier.
It won't make it easier, trust me.",fadedblackleggings,2019-04-13 15:26:09,1,1485,12.04,49.19,77.1,29.14,15,11.31,93.6,63.16,24.31,16.03,8.89,0.47,4.31,0.27,2.09,8.28,4.85,11.25,12.32,6.33,7.14,3.37,21.95,4.24,2.9,2.09,0.54,1.21,6.8,3.5,3.3,0.67,0.54,0.4,13.47,0.34,0.07,0.34,0.34,14.14,1.82,2.15,1.95,4.18,0.74,6.13,2.63,0.67,1.28,0.67,2.29,0.13,2.02,0.07,0,5.86,1.68,1.62,1.82,1.01,0.81,4.65,14.61,0.88,10.84,1.68,5.05,4.38,2.83,1.08,0.07,0.61,0.07,0.27,0.54,0.07,0.27,0.27,0,0,21.48,5.99,4.44,3.23,0,1.14,0,0.07,2.02,3.3,0.13,1.14

bcyx7h,Does anyone else feel like they have to hide their pain a lot of times when dealing with this?,"I just finished watching A Star is Born, had no prior knowledge of what it was about and it really hit hard. At my last therapy session I asked my therapist if PTSD is something people overcome or is this something I'm going to have to deal with my entire life. Seeing that main character hiding his pain behind his drinking and drug use struck a chord with me and it made me wonder if anyone else feels like they have to hide their pain from their struggles with this because I know I do. I've tried talking about it with people close to me and you can tell they just don't get it. It feels like people aren't equipped to deal with other's having mental issues and I get it. If we can't figure it out how are they supposed to know what to say? But not only do I feel like I struggle with the recurring pain of what I went through, but I also struggle with keeping it inside so that no one else is affected by what I'm going through. If I ever feel vulnerable enough to open up to someone other than my therapist, the common thing I hear is, ""But you always seem so happy."" Fucking kill me, I'm tired of hearing that. It's not because they're saying it, but because I know how hard I'm trying to hide it so that people don't look at me with the stigma of 2019.

bczf32,Abuser is here for a visit...,"**Potential Trigger Warning**

So, some background. I am diagnosed with PTSD, bipolar 1, and GAD. Things are not going well treatment wise/me wise. I recently had a lot of ECT and Ketamine treatments, lost most of my memory of the last 5 years or so, and had a suicide attempt 2 weeks ago(but didn't go inpatient because I have gone so much recently... I'm like afraid to bother them.)


My PTSD would probably be ""complex"". I have had 6 sexual assaults(one was a repeat event daily fora while) in varying degrees from 2 rapes to attempted rape, starting at the age 5 or 6. This involves that first ""incident"" which was molestation by an older(13-14) family member. I repressed it until I was 14 and finally told my parents at 15 when they asked why I was so depressed. The actual event was made worse by my parents reaction. I was told to tell no one or I would ruin the family. They took me to counseling but I had to lie about where I was going. I have 5 other siblings and I am the youngest. 

The sibling who hurt me admitted to it, and was remorseful. He wrote me a letter of apology(I refused to see him at the time out of fear). In a lot of ways we are ok now. We never talked about it face to face, and he is really like... careful? about how he acts. I'm 30 now, so time has passed, but I do still have PTSD. My family is bad with it, so I have to pretend nothing happened. 

I live with my family, unable to work and on disability. When my Mom told me he was coming to town I got very anxious and started having flashbacks to the event. I keep having them. He's here now, and It's like it just keeps taking over my mind and I get transported to that night. I have a lot of pretty severe disassociative episodes lately, and this isn't helping. 

He came over tonight and hung out with my other sibling in his bedroom, and I was really terrified he would stop by mine to say hi(the event took place in my childhood bedroom). He is a good person, and intelligent, so he probably knew not to. It was just a mistake, and I hold no anger about it towards him, but that doesn't matter to my brain. Too many people have hurt me. I'm constantly stuck in fear(freeze) mode. 

The next few days will be hard. Especially because I can't even talk to anyone about it. If I brought it up, I know my Mom would be mad. 

I guess I don't have a purpose for this post other than to get it out. My mind starts obsessing over it, especially the time after I told my parents, which in a lot of ways was worse than what happened when I was little.

bczx71,Triggered 2 decades later - why are brains so strange? (sexual assault trigger warning),"Welp, the human brain thoroughly confuses me. Through a series of triggerings, heavy therapy, and increasingly corroborating evidence, nearly 20 years later it appears I may have found my trauma. Yet... I’m still constantly questioning if it’s just false memories or me being dramatic. I had plenty of “symptoms” of young trauma and my therapist gently suggested perhaps there’s something to uncover, but I dismissed that as baseless conjecture.

Background facts... 
* knew that I remember 1st grade and 3rd grade vividly, yet had no recollection of 2nd grade (teacher, life events that I know happened that year, etc)
* knew that I was given paper bags for “hyperventilating” by my third grade teacher randomly and didn’t understand, and was yelled at and punished by parents upon them finding out
* knew that my uncle (mom’s side) was suddenly cast out of the family at some point in my childhood, assumedly due to his alcoholism
* knew that when my mom found a suicide hotline card after seeing the school counselor in middle school for anxiety and depression, she panicked and screamed at me yelling “what did you tell them?” and scolding me to not talk to her again, before consequently moving out of the state in the following months and blaming it on me
* knew that I was prone to knee-jerk panic reactions from sexual partners touching my butt, and jumpy to touch in general

Then how we got from point A to point B...
Long story short, was traveling for work, ended up meeting a bunch of people, ended up at a club with dancing, and a wonderful young woman I had met said, “c’mon, just dance with me and this guy.” So... I did! Nothing sexual, just goofy friendly dancing. Harmless! ... until he suddenly got a little too friendly and got up on me and grabbed my ass. I was somewhere lightly past tipsy, but suddenly my whole body shut down - I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t support my own weight, I couldn’t speak; pure and utter dissociation like I hadn’t felt before. This woman and her brother kindly took me back to her place, and comforted me for multiple hours before I returned to my hotel, confused and disturbed as ever.

In the proceeding weeks, I started dissociating hard more and more, without prompting - to a point that my vision completely blurred out and started seeing blurry objects as other things. Most often, it was a nondescript man making various brief, photographic motions while laying or standing, and consequently screaming and reeling. This continued until one night, while with my ever supportive significant other, I dissociated staring at her, her face blurred, and... saw my uncle’s face. I hadn’t thought of him in many years, and panicked. This continued similarly for a while.

After tying together those background facts to this, I said just enough on the phone with my mother to get a reaction which clearly implied, yes, something happened, and yes, she knew about it. I had already accepted that they were ashamed about my mental health, and that I could never have them be part of my life in that regard - but this is a whole other barrel of monkeys keeping me from seeking help to protect a molester.

I feel like I’m going insane. I’m alternating between doubt and telling myself I’m making all of this up for attention, and it just going blank in my head, and feeling angry and perturbed and distressed. I’ve had horrible memory issues despite being cognitively strong since I was pretty young, and my therapist believes it’s likely related. It’s terrifying that the brain could possibly repress something for so long and suffer such damage, and STILL not be able to truly recall details and circumstances. 

Can anyone here relate, or do I sound like I’m false memory-ing myself to the moon and back?

bd26q1,"Is it okay, just for now, to heal not for myself?","(Just in case, TW: Suicidal Thoughts) 

I struggle a lot with wanting to die. It's all very passive. But like still there, ya know? 

At first, I was going through the motions of therapy, medication, etc. to get better for myself, I just want to feel better. That's what I thought, though. I don't know if I ever truly believed that. I've made progress, that's something not even I deny. But my motivation for anything has just been plummeting for months now. I feel momentary horrible anxiety about consequences, but ultimately I feel like I don't have consequences. 

Maybe, because I don't see a future for myself. Or maybe because I didn't see myself living past eighteen, so I don't know how to see a future for myself. It's all just speculation, really. 

The trauma I felt, the abuse that was done to me, it destroyed me as a person. I have come to realize that the person I was before my abuse...I can never get her back. She is now a ghost. I don't know who I am anymore. I don't who this person is, I don't know whose body I'm staying in. My trauma...it's been like my birth. I hate it. I hate it so much, but...I can't do anything about it. I don't even know if it's worth going back to who I was before. 

I think I have different hobbies I want to pursue, and I think I have a different favorite color. My favorite flowers are different, but my least favorite foods will always be the same. 

My body seems to remember my old self, but my brain does not, cannot. And I don't think I want to push it. I think, just like you do with a kid, I'm going to let it figure out who this new person is. 

But for the time, I have no hopes for this person. I have no foreseeable consequences...or more so, I just can't feel them beyond that insane instantaneous anxiety. But I don't like putting the people I love through this. Just because I don't see much potential for myself, doesn't mean I don't see futures for anyone else. 

So is it okay, while I'm trying to figure out this new person that I am, that I just get better for my hamsters? My lovely dog? My parents? My boyfriend? 

My boyfriend...I want to get better for him the most. I love him so much. But he tells me the same things everyday about what I need to do, and he tries so hard, and I know he is so tired. 

Is it unhealthy to try and get healthy for these things in my life? At least for now? I want to do it for myself eventually, but how do I get to that point?",orangecrowest,2019-04-14 05:18:19,3,485,4.49,2.55,97.68,48.74,11.55,11.96,98.14,66.39,27.22,18.14,16.08,0,0.41,1.44,0.21,9.07,3.3,11.75,12.16,8.66,7.01,4.74,23.92,5.57,4.12,1.86,0.41,2.06,5.77,3.51,2.27,0.82,1.03,0,6.39,0.21,0.41,0.41,1.44,18.14,5.36,2.06,2.06,3.51,1.44,5.57,2.47,1.24,0,1.24,2.68,0.62,1.44,0,0.21,6.19,1.03,2.27,1.03,2.06,0.62,2.68,20.62,2.06,9.48,1.65,2.47,5.98,0.21,0.21,0,0.21,0,0.62,0.62,0,0.21,0.41,0,0,24.54,9.9,6.6,0.21,0,1.86,0,0,0,5.57,0.41,0
bd34iy,Hi. I think I'm separated from my husband. I am not really sure what's happening. I have ptsd and it looks like he does too. But right now I am dealing with this as being separated. Trigger warning,"Trigger warning: abuse car accident child abuse 


I have ptsd and in the last 2 years we were severely traumatized by:

Me leaving a job bc they were cutting corners in Grey areas on mandated reporting of child abuse

me getting off psychiatric drugs after being rediagnosed with PTSD instead of bipolar

me getting hit by a drunk driver and getting a concussion 

me being denied proper medical care by workers comp

me being laid off at a new job (unrelated to my condition,  company wide)

 me being illegally forced to leave a different, new workplace because of my disability

me deteriorating to full disability from improper medical care

Us being severely abused by my ex family (birth family now estranged and we are safe)

Hi grandma passing away

My cousin passing away suddenly 

Legal battles between his mom and aunt's over elder abuse 

Very serious Repeating daily trauma from me being in pain 

Going through the full process of going nc with my immediate family after being abused ( previously believed loving family towards both of us)

( not trauma but another stress)  he went back to school and works 60-70 hours a week studying taking over a full class load. We are starting to run out of money, got that fixed last week.

My husband nursed me back to health,  doing all the household chores while I recovered for 6 months. 

In Feb- March I had healed a lot and recovered my repressed memory of the abuse from my family (which really happened to both of us).  

I also recovered a huge 10  year series of blank spots of child abuse by my ex father and ex grandfather and about how my mom died in a semi - violent unnatural way,  grandfather likely partially responsible. 

Husband also was severely abused in a previous marriage by a con artist psychopath.  

My husband looks like hes having ptsd,  but he's asking to be separated right now. He won't talk to me at all so I'm just taking him at his word that he doesn't want to be together anymore. I'm really confused but writing this list out got me out of the moment and realizing we both are having seriously severe ptsd reactions and nervous breakdowns from the horrible insane shit we have been through. I'm starting therapy next week which is  both something he asked me to do and something I need. I was too scared to go back when it looked like I was needing help for concussion symptoms.  My body and mind were off the charts scared until I recovered the true abuse and memories last month.

bd36vj,PTSD and marriage- TW,"My husband and I have been together for almost six years and married for three. We were together for only six months when his mother died.

At six months, we were starting to get comfortable and a routine with each other. Exchanged house keys and I love you’s. I was really starting to get to know him when she died and to this day I feel like I never got to know the true person my husband is. Of course he was consumed by her death. She was a single mom and his best friend. I didn’t get a chance to form a relationship with her and I’ll always feel that loss.

I supported him through what I thought were the stages of grief after death but his anger and depression never seemed to subside. I never put a time limit on how long he “should be sad”. But his anger and depression got worse. In 2017 he was diagnosed with PTSD. We felt better that there was a reason for his emotions and our household seemed to feel lighter. He tried medication but he didn’t like the way he felt on them. I didn’t know how to handle that so I went along with him off of the meds. He tried medical cannabis for a year but gave that up too. He also isn’t seeing any professional to help him.

In January of this year I found out I’m pregnant. He also found out his job will be absorbed this summer. The news was exciting but bittersweet for him. All good news has a twinge of heartache since he can’t share it with his mom. I understand that. The stress of his job stuff has overcome him and looking for work is crippling him. He’s indecisive, angry, so stressed he developed shingles (I’m fine, he’s not contagious), and completely unhappy.

His moods are affecting me. They always affect me but I’m starting to feel hopeless. I go through waves of hardcore support when I try to make everything perfect to avoid him being triggered by anything. I will also back off and be there to listen when he’s triggered or down. I let him do nothing or I get him out of the house to do something. I’ve read about enabling a spouses’ PTSD and I don’t know if I’m fully doing that or not doing enough to help with enabling. I went into a panic when I found out about the shingles because while I believed him how stressed he was at work, I didn’t know he was internalizing that badly. I looked and found 8 potential jobs prospects. I found a counselor for him and made an appointment. I planned a weekend trip that we didn’t end up going on. It all felt like the right thing AND like the wrong thing at the same time. I feel joyless myself when I’m home. I’d rather be at work, honestly. I’d rather be around my parents who are states away because this feels like too much at times and I just want someone to baby me. Make me spaghetti and watch my favorite movie with me. I don’t need him to be sunny or constantly happy. I’m a realist and life is allowed to be shitty. I can get through my day coping with the daily annoyances without them making my week completely negative. I can understand him but I feel he’s changing who I am. I just want him to feel content and looking to our future with some positivity. We’re having our first baby.

I’m tired of having the same fight about his moods and I’m worried to have that fight around the kid. We fought tonight and it made me sick. I screamed “should I get rid of it!!” in anger and I want punch myself for going there. I’m in love with my kid already and ended up in bed repeating to myself “you’re wanted. You’re wanted.” I can see my priorities on happiness changing and I don’t want to be consumed by his mood swings anymore. My pregnancy is my happiness and I shouldn’t feel like I’m not allowed to see light in our future. I shouldn’t cry so often about how depressed our household feels.

I needed to get all this out. I’ll take any advice. I don’t know how to TL;DR this so I’ll just say I’m married and pregnant to a PTSD spouse and it’s getting to me.",korenic,2019-04-14 07:19:19,2,753,18.31,42.62,57.78,13.24,12.98,14.87,94.69,61.22,23.24,18.99,10.62,1.46,0.27,6.24,0.4,4.25,3.85,14.21,10.89,6.24,8.37,2.92,22.05,2.92,1.59,1.86,1.06,1.2,7.44,2.92,3.85,0.93,1.06,1.2,13.68,2.12,0.13,0.93,5.98,16.07,4.25,3.19,1.99,2.52,1.99,3.59,3.45,1.2,0.4,1.73,1.99,0.13,1.46,0.4,0.13,9.56,3.72,2.12,1.73,2.26,0.53,6.24,13.15,1.59,11.95,1.33,4.91,5.84,1.46,0.27,0.8,0.13,0,0.66,0.13,0.13,0,0,0,0,15.41,7.44,0.93,0,0.13,0,0.27,0.13,0.8,5.44,0.27,0

bd4o22,When my s/o shuts me out and I think it’s the trauma,"So, my s/o is an incredible guy who’s given his whole life since he was 18 to the military. I could write a litany of things I adore about him but I won’t subject the reddit community ;) Anyway he’s been through some shit and I think only recently (a few yrs from retirement) has started to realize he may have some trauma related issues. We don’t know if he has full blown ptsd or just some of the symptoms, but in my mind the label doesn’t matter, what matters is that he (and I) are living things that I feel convinced are tied to the trauma he experienced. He’s hesitant to get help or be diagnosed (not unwilling, just hesitant) because he’s worried he wouldn’t be allowed to keep working and he loves what he does, and of course the whole army mental health stigma thing. You know the drill. 

And I get it.

But we’re already trying to navigate a long distance relationship, and when he’s not doing well he goes through periods where he shuts down and shuts me (and everyone) out suddenly and for indefinite periods of time.

That’s happening right now. And the thing is, I know I’m just going to have to wait for him to resurface, there’s really no other choice. I have almost only compassion and love for him, and while I feel upset and hurt on a personal level, I don’t feel like it’s about me — in fact I know it’s not. I just want to be able to be there to support and love on him, and I don’t want him to feel like a burden or a failure (got this from him, not my assumption). He’s been infinitely patient and compassionate with my anxiety issues that would have thrown any guy for a loop, so I want to be able to do the same for him. It hurts when I can’t.

But I just don’t know how to handle these situations. Of course my anxiety and emotions go haywire when I just get shut out and don’t know when I’ll next hear from him.

So I guess I need insight. He’s not telling me what he needs from me right now, or anything for that matter. I don’t know what helps or hurts. The first week I was pretty persistent trying to get through, but then eventually realized it was no good. This past week (second week) I’ve periodically reached out or tried to call, still to no effect. I’ve tried to stay gentle in my messages and say that I love him and am here etc but just need to hear something from him. But he’s not even opening messages and I have a hunch he’s leaving his phone off now.

My best guess is that he’s getting messages from a lot of family and loved ones and can’t bear to answer or have to constantly ignore notifications. Which would mean he’s really not in a good place. He’s such a gentle and loving soul so I know it gives him pain to shut people he loves out, which tells me his overwhelm and/or depression is even more painful.

So I have only been able to respond to what I feel in determining how and whether to reach out. Not his needs since I don’t know what they are. And so I don’t know, does being persistent help or make it worse, or does it have no effect at all? I don’t mean eight messages or calls a day. I never sent more than about two a day and now it’s only every few days. I don’t want to leave him isolated but I don’t want to pile on more guilt that will push him deeper into a shutdown. And I’m losing my mind not hearing from him. I miss him badly so it’s pretty hard not to make efforts at contact in hopes of finally getting through. Last time this happened I just let him do his thing and waited for him to reach out, and it was almost a month before I heard from him. I don’t think I can bear to do that again.

I don’t really know what to do.

And yes, therapy is on the table and will be a discussion, but I just need insight on how best to deal right now. Or is there no definite answer and I’m just gonna have to weather the suckiness of not knowing until he finally makes contact and I can ask him directly?

I was repeatedly raped when I was younger and developed a ritual that calmed me down. After having “sex” I would make myself throw up, shower, brush my teeth, among other things. I was clean everywhere. It calmed me down. From there, for around a decade, I have retained that eating disorder for many reasons. 


Eventually I stopped, the impulse ended. Well, something upsetting happened where I was reminded of being raped so I went home, did the whole ritual. I felt a lot better. Then I felt upset the next day and ate a bunch of food, felt guilt, and purged. And the next day. And the next. It just calmed me down so much. I guess long story short last week a homeless dude cornered me and tried to kiss me, which is upsetting in and of itself but being trapped and feeling unclean really impacted me. Had to feel clean. 


I saw stars and almost choked, I’m in pain, I know I could have a seizure by throwing up my anti seizure meds and then choke and die. Or almost die and have someone call the police and get trapped in a psych ward with no autonomy. 

Bringing it up to my therapist would basically be like “hey remember the coping mechanisms you taught me? I ignored them” what are they gonna do? How can they help when I act so uncooperative. I don’t want them to be upset by my set back and I thought they were helping. I just decided to do something unproductive and I’m embarrassed.  Anyone who found out would think I’m not actually a happy and capable person. And, long story short, some of them would love to prove that. 


So now I just have to... not do it. Just don’t do it. Just don’t stress eat.  Just don’t throw up. And find a way to tell my therapist.",Redjay12,2019-04-14 10:43:32,4,353,19.76,17.49,92.74,6.7,11.77,13.88,89.52,58.64,18.13,12.75,10.76,0,0.28,0,1.7,5.38,4.82,10.48,10.2,8.22,9.35,2.27,20.4,4.25,1.13,2.27,0,1.7,5.1,1.7,3.4,1.98,0.57,0,5.95,0,0.28,0,0,12.18,4.25,1.13,1.7,3.12,0.57,2.55,2.27,0.28,0,1.98,5.38,0.28,2.27,1.13,1.42,5.95,0.85,1.13,3.4,0.57,0.85,6.23,10.76,1.13,13.88,1.7,6.52,5.95,1.7,0,0.57,0,0.57,0.57,1.13,0,0.28,0,0.28,0,17,8.22,4.25,0,0,0.57,0,0,1.7,2.27,0,0
bd6b20,Has anyone successfully recovered to the point of living a meaningful life?,"Before my trauma, I was incredibly happy, joyful, and high-functioning. I had dreams of going to grad-school for neuroscience and doing and seeing so many incredible things. It has been almost 5 years since my trauma now and I don't feel like I have grown as a person at all since that day. I have since developed severe chronic psycho-somatic pain in my head that is almost 24/7. I am finally doing EMDR now which I have had some progress with but my rage and frustration at my brain not being at the level it was before really drives me insane. I can't even read a book because it hurts so bad, and I have spent half of the past 5 years unemployed because everything I do feels like torture because of the pain. I used to meditate every day and be such a light to the world, now I am mostly isolated and I can't help but feel the pain I'm in subliminally transfers to the people I'm around because very few people want to stick around at this point. I grew up with ADHD and depression and I spent a lot of time feeling empty and wishing I could feel things, but now that all I feel is pain I would do anything to get back to that emptiness because at least I would be able to relax. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question now is: is there any hope for me? I can't imagine having any healthy relationships when I'm in this much pain and suffering, and my cognitive dysfunction makes me feel like I'm mentally handicapped which might be the most torturous part of all. I also feel so vulnerable and even a slight perceived negative comment or opinion towards me makes me feel so small and weak and triggers me hard. I have been feeling desperate for human support and companionship but I have no idea how I'm supposed to meet people when I am like this and there have been no peers around my age at any of the support groups I've tried going to (I am close to 26). I am working towards bettering myself everyday with healthy habits but I still feel so unbearably stuck and I am struggling to find motivation to keep pushing forward.

He was an amazing scientist. It’s part of what killed him. He wanted to do a lot more work and research into diseases and the blood/brain barrier. But his lab forced him to retire early and he took it personally.

bd8trt,"Feeling averse to normal, healthy partnerships after long-term emotional and sexual abuse?","I realized I have no intrinsic desire for a ‘normal’ ‘healthy’ romantic relationship. I see people I know being cute together and “in love” and don’t feel jealous or desiring of that but actually... averse and anxious? Like... I’m glad that’s not me? When I think about meeting a guy to “date,” and be cute with, I also feel averse. When I think about meeting a guy to just have sex with, I feel a little excited... but even that in and of itself isn’t that great-sounding. The only stuff that excites me is illicit or dangerous. 

I guess I just don’t understand and feel like I am destined to be like my dad’s side of the family: lonely and alone. They’re all traumatized by their families, and single, and will be forever. It’s very sad and I don’t know if I’ll escape that legacy, given that I now apparently feel *aversion* to healthy partnerships, to the extent that I see cute, happy couples and feel anxious at the thought of being one of them. I feel some relief at the thought of being alone. And yet I am, of course, extremely lonely and starved of tender touch and when I do hug someone I hold on for dear life.

It also makes me feel like I deserve my abuse because it seems like that’s what I want... right?

bd8zbn,Is it normal to not remember what happened or think that it helped you?,"I'm sorry, I'm new to this subreddit. I'm not even sure if I belong here. A few years ago, when I was in middle school, my mother had gotten a new boyfriend. Weirdly, I can't remember anything that happened in those five years, except for a few things (him kicking my dogs, drowning me, strangling me, etc). Everything else is blank. And it's not like it was 20+ years ago, it happened around 7 years ago. My mother recently brought him up in a conversation about just how lucky we were to survive him, but I only remember snippets and sometimes more memories come back if she mentions them, but overall, I can't remember the school I went to or what I did in that time or even who my friends were (I can remember friends from elementary school with no problem, but I went to a different MS and can't remember anything). Is this normal for people who were abused as children?

My other question is this: Do you think that your abuse helped you in any way? Don't get me wrong, abuse is terrible (I flinch whenever someone tries to high five me and I hate men who are older than me) but whenever I hear people talking about how great their lives have been, I think back on the memories I do have about that time and I think to myself ""I am lucky I experienced that"". In some strange way, I believe that it helped me be who I am. If I could go back in time and change it, I wouldn't. Is this normal?

bd991c,Husband to trauma survivor,"Hello. This will be a lot but I hope this is a community that can help me with advice. 
I’m married to an amazing woman, but I worry about her often. 
She has Severe PTSD, anxiety and depression. This comes from over 20 years of abuse in all forms. 
I knew this getting into the relationship and have always loved her through it. 
Recently (last 6 months) it seems to have gotten worse. 
She’s been cutting herself (thighs) and is sick nearly every single day. 
When it started she was having such severe panic attacks she would just slam her head against a wall or anything she could find. 
I fell asleep one night and woke up to glass shattering and her using a broken piece of glass to cut her thigh this was the first time she cut. She ended up in hospital for a few days cause I called 911 worried she might kill herself. 
She got somewhat better but now she’s walled herself off from everyone. Our daughter stays at her grandparents most days and with me being away for work for a month she barely texts or calls. She’s started drawing dark images of cuts on thighs and said she’s been have terrible intrusive thoughts. I can’t get her to talk to me about it and I’m so scared... how can I help? 
She is on new meds now (changed maybe 2 months ago) she will not go to therapy again cause she feels it won’t really do anything and we will most likely move out of state by the end of the year so she thinks it’s pointless.

 Trigger warning!

 I survived a bin lorry accident that happened in Glasgow in 2014. Since then well I've been diagnosed with severe Ptsd. I was in my last year of uni when the accident happened and I had to stop my studies. In 2017, I contacted lawyers to claim and it has been ongoing since. Last summer they advised me to go back to university as it would help my case so I followed their advise. I initially felt very good as I felt like my life was back on track but I now realise that I may have made a mistake. I totally ignored anything that revolved around my Ptsd. So I started my application to get student loan but when it asked about my disability I just kept putting it back. I also had to deal with lawyers prepping for court. So I had to travel across the country each time to visit them which was emotionally draining as it was where a lot of my triggers are. I then had the court case on valentines day which was as horrific as you can imagine it being. Because of all of this I've missed quite a lot of uni and my uni is actually threatening to kick me out now due to the payment issue which I am trying to resolve. I have started Emdr treatment but due to everyone happening with university I feel like I cannot really focus on the treatment. A lot of my feelings after the accident is that I lost my pride and everything happening is triggering me I think. I was thinking that the best may be to redo the year next year if my university permits it. I'm worried though as my parents already think I am too old to continue university at 28. I think they are also at the stage where they feel frustrated with my ptsd. I have heard them say numerous times that I should start to get over it... Does anyone have any advice?

bd9liu,How can I best support my girlfriend?,"TW: child abuse

Alt account because my primary account has a poorly-chosen username that resembles my real name lol.  

My girlfriend wasn't at church this morning.  She texted me later and said basically that last night she'd had really bad trauma-related nightmares for the first time in a very long time.  She was sexually abused during her childhood (we're both in our 20s now), and although she's grown so much into a wonderful, fun-loving, bubbly woman, I know trauma like that doesn't just disappear forever.  She continued on to say she needed alone time and apologised that she'd be missing something we were going to do together after church.    

I responded and said that she needn't be sorry in the slightest, it wasn't her fault, and that she'd just had a horrible experience so of course she needed time to herself and I or anyone else would feel the same in her position.  I said to let me know if she wanted me to bring her food or something after I got out of church, and also tried to make clear that if not, that was fine, as I understood that she needed time and privacy.  I also told her that if she ever wanted to talk, I'd be there to listen, and if she needed anything, to not hesitate to ask.  

She hasn't replied yet, but that's fine; like I said, I respect her need to deal with this on her own.  (I probably won't bring her food lol; usually I'll show up with something if she misses church due to feeling under the weather, but I figure this is pretty different from waking up with a headache, and I'm unsure that my spontaneous presence - with food she might not necessarily want to eat - would be helpful in this particular case.  I don't want her to have to cook while she's feeling down already, but I trust she knows what she needs better than I would.)

Thing is, I have no idea what I'm doing.  We've known each other several years and been together several months, and although I knew about her past before we started dating, this is the first time that she's told me about something like this happening.  I'm also not the most emotional or empathetic person lmao (indeed, she often teases me that I should go into the field of psychology, knowing it's one of the last things I could see myself doing) so I'm awkward in these situations and worried about making a faux pas.  I want to support her but I also respect that I need to balance that support with her need for privacy.

bdbis2,I can't take this anymore.,"How am I supposed to heal when I watched someone get tortured to death in front of me and was forced to hold someone back. How the fuck am I supposed to heal. Everyday I see something that reminds me of them and I just feel sick. I try to remember the happy times but knowing they left this world with that horrified, tortured screaming look on their face...just how. People keep telling me to stay in the present. But you weren't there! You didnt see it. It makes all the good memories not matter because they left the world in pain. The last thing they tried to say was help me. They last thing they felt was unbearable pain. I try so hard to see others happy and think look they're happy it's okay but then I remember then getting tortured to death. They were tortured to death okay. The look in their eyes after they died, the horror, their cold bodies...

And I can't even fucking cry because my antidepressants took my ability to cry away from me so I'm just sitting here with a screaming expression on my dry fucking face

I get flashbacks I get nights where it's non stop watching them die begging my abuser not to kill them listening to my other abuser taunt about murdering them

bdeen9,I got frustrated,"It's no secret that I was adopted, parents died and shit happened when I was a teenager and I've been independent since. I spent so many years of my life on 'survival mode' that I became quite isolated and have fairly niche interests. My memory is whack and I pretty much hate having casual conversations with most people, but it's fine so long as its in the context of work (I'm pretty good at sales...).

So, on paper, am doing great. I've just been awarderd a PhD studentship (awesome!), but TBH I find it really difficult to focus most days and can only cram in about 20hrs a week cause I'll get brain fog. My body just shuts down. I have an aversion to intellectual work and conversation. Give me something physical to do outside and I'm all over it. 

Well, I made a friend who was also finding school a bit difficult. I decided to take Prozac cause my panic attacks were returning. I get anxious when I can't control my productivity, and also when I don't have a community around me. I feel responsible for the way I feel and for my interactions.

It was my Dad's death anniversary and she's says ""that's really shit"", but I was celebrating his life. She'd say, ""that's really shit"" about the smallest of things. I didn't find it empthatic. It's raining, yes it rains. It happens. It doesn't have to ruin your day. 

She kept asking me to not criticize her thinking cause it was upsetting her, so I then asked her not to blame the world cause it was frustrating me. I just really couldn't stand that she wanted everyone to modify themselves to suit her. But really I could just sense that I have a huge aversion to playing the victim story cause if I did that it would destroy my sense of self and actually how far I've come and my ability to overcome problems. That's not the story I want to tell.

bdf44j,My work is threatening to fire me,"Hi everyone, 

To keep a long story short, my supervisors at my work (state bureaucratic job) called me into a meeting on Friday and let me know that they were considering firing me this week once my 6 month probation period is up because, essentially, I don’t socialize enough with my co-workers. I explained to them during the meeting that my PTSD, which I’ve told them about before , saps a lot of my mental energy and I am constantly battling anxiety attacks and flashbacks, etc., throughout the workday, which is very mentally and emotionally draining, and leaves engaging in small talk with others quite difficult for me. I’ve never been rude or disrespectful to anyone at my job, and I’ve never turned in sub-par work as a result of my difficulty socializing (they agreed with this). I simply don’t engage in small talk like some of my other co-workers do. However, my supervisors did not care when I explained all of this, and said that they simply have to fill out the “objective forms” that indicate whether or not I’m qualified for the job, and that my introverted behavior makes them have reservations. I don’t know what to do at this point, but I’m feeling really mistreated, and I am about to head into this work week fully expecting it to be my last.

E.g. if a person experiences X trauma and X Trauma causes PTSD how would said person react differently if they were to experience X trauma again? Would they act differently?

I’ve read that they would get something similar to an adrenaline rush as to make sure they can’t experience the trauma again. But I have also read that they just freeze (because I can’t think of a better word).

bdhkrk,"PTSD and dating (33F, 30M)","Does anyone have any good resources where I can find information about PTSD and dating/romantic relationships? Or any anecdotal experience; things that were difficult, things that helped?

I'm in a brand new relationship (less than a month) with a guy who has PTSD from his international human rights work. He is currently in therapy weekly, and will be doing a month-long full-time program for PTSD in the summer. He's been fairly open about his mental health and it's good to see that he's taking treatment seriously. I've done a lot of work in trauma-heavy fields in my career as well, so i relate to a certain extent.

I have a couple main concerns: that he's looking at me and our connection as something that will ""make him happy"", and that he is investing too much too soon in our relationship. He told me he loved me last night, which is way too soon for me. I realize I'm being affected by stereotypes and media representations of PTSD, so I feel a bit guilty saying this, but I'm starting to get worried that he is unhealthily fixated on me, and I want to make sure that I'm safe in this relationship.",llenade_ballena,2019-04-15 08:51:53,4,209,23.42,66.67,47.16,62.07,20.9,14.35,90.43,56.46,22.49,14.35,8.13,0.96,0,5.26,0,8.13,4.31,11.96,12.44,5.74,6.7,0,19.62,6.22,1.91,1.44,0,3.35,6.7,4.31,2.39,0.96,0,0,12.92,0,0.48,0,5.74,9.57,2.39,1.44,0.48,3.35,0.96,1.44,2.87,0.96,0.48,0.96,1.44,0,0.96,0,0,8.61,4.78,0.96,0,1.91,0.96,2.87,14.83,1.91,14.35,0,7.66,6.7,2.87,0,0,0.48,0,0,0.48,0,0,0,0.48,0,18.66,3.35,4.31,0.48,0.48,0.96,0,1.44,0.96,4.31,1.91,0.48
bdi51z,Are perpetual nightmares based in reality a symptom?,"Recently I was diagnosed with “probably” OCD, anxiety and depression, but I was put on meds without actually having a formal diagnosis. Prior to starting the meds, I had been daily smoking weed for about 3 years. I started using it to suppress intrusive thoughts and dreams that mostly stemmed from a situation that caused me to dissociate from reality for about 3 months. Since childhood, and since taking a 2 week tbreak after starting the meds, I have been having recurrent nightmares. They always consist of something from 3 categories: the world ending in a very apocalyptic manner (bombs, people burning alive); me getting chased by a serial killer, followed by the police letting me die to the killer; having a conversation based on things that have happened in real life (usually I find out really disturbing news), and after I wake it can take days for me to realize it never happened; flashbacks to childhood (dad abusing me and my mother, and situations that I would consider molestation, but I have no idea if the latter actually happened); and sexual dreams with no context until I’m fucking some random girl and have immense guilt that I’m cheating on my girlfriend. All of these themes except for fucking random girls are based in reality (though I was “cheated” on and lied to by a girl once), and lately I’ve been able to link these themes to specific incidents that one would probably consider “traumatic” — shootings, abused by cops, held knifepoint at 13, lots of other crime scenes, tornados, questionable activities that an adult and child would participate in, bullying, fights, gang violence at 12-13, seeing remains of someone who was burned alive when I was 14, etc. Had blocked most of this stuff out until recently now that I’ve been trying to understand the dreams",skitzzzo,2019-04-15 09:35:22,10,315,71.46,25.24,85.32,1,39.38,23.49,85.08,51.75,13.65,7.3,6.98,0,0,0,0.32,6.35,5.08,16.19,8.89,4.76,5.71,1.27,16.51,4.13,1.59,0.63,3.17,1.27,6.03,0,6.03,0.95,3.17,0.32,5.4,0.63,0.63,1.27,0.32,14.92,3.49,2.22,1.27,4.13,1.27,3.17,0.95,0.32,0,0.63,3.81,0.32,2.22,0.95,0.32,4.44,0.95,1.27,1.27,0.95,0.32,6.03,6.03,0,14.92,0.63,4.76,9.52,0.32,0.95,0,0,0,1.59,0.63,0.63,0,0,0,0,16.51,1.9,6.67,0.32,1.27,0.32,0,0.32,1.9,1.27,2.54,0

I'm really stressed out and just spread too thin ... one of my biggest issues is not having any money right now - all my closest friends are dead so I can't ask them for help and my family isn't very close to me ... I ended up reaching out to a sub that Redditors can get a loan from another and pay them back - I was able to do it last month and it worked out great so I was hoping to get help this month .... I had two different people agree to help me and kind of go through the whole vetting process together before they just ghosted me - I realize my problem isn't anyone else's problem and no one is required or expected to help me ..... but that feeling of feeling really afraid and stuck then having someone tell you they'd help you - it was such a huge weight off my shoulders only to then end up back at square one .... really sucked. I'm just so tired.

bdn1gj,Dealing with being re-victimized [Trigger warning],"For context, I have severe PTSD from a mentally, emotionally, and physically abusive relationship I had with a boy I used to date. He would threaten to kill himself when I would try and break things off, and would send me pictures of his attempts and blame me. This still gives me awful flashbacks and just generally fucked me up. I told my now ex-girlfriend everything, she helped me with my therapy and learning to live day to day with what he had done. She knew everything about what he had done and how much he had hurt me.

I recently broke up with my long distance girlfriend of two years over Skype (we are in different countries), and it wasn't pretty. She was, understandably, upset and crying. I told her to call her parents so they could get her and she refused. She began telling me there was no point to her being alive or safe if I wasn't there, and since we would never see each other again it wouldn't even matter. She started using her safety as a threat- saying she wasn't going to be safe if I left her. 

I went on autopilot, I immediately texted her friends and family to get her even though I knew it wasn't really my place. I made sure she was safe and hung up. It didn't really register with me what she had done until a few days ago, and I've been a mess since. I don't know how she could know all of that and then just throw it back in my face. I don't know what to do, I want to talk it out with someone but I don't know who would even listen. It just fucking hurts so much. 

I didn't expect being re-victimized, and I feel weak and useless. I feel awful and like everything is my fault. I don't know where to go from here or what to do, I feel like the same scared kid from all those years ago that was flailing and alone. 

Any help is much appreciated, I'm just really at a loss right now.",qiankgs,2019-04-15 16:46:17,5,363,5.8,34.98,56.88,1,17.29,11.85,96.42,64.19,24.24,17.91,10.47,0.55,0,6.61,0.28,6.34,1.93,11.85,11.85,7.99,9.09,3.58,22.59,4.41,1.65,2.75,0.28,2.2,8.82,1.93,6.89,1.1,1.93,1.93,14.88,0.55,1.1,4.96,1.93,16.53,3.58,2.2,3.31,2.48,1.93,4.68,2.48,0.55,0.55,1.38,2.2,0.28,1.38,0.55,0,8.54,2.48,0.55,3.58,0.55,2.48,9.64,9.64,0.83,13.22,1.38,5.51,6.34,0.55,0.28,0.28,0,0,0.55,0.55,0.55,0,0,0,0,15.43,5.51,4.13,0,0,0,0,1.1,0,3.58,0.55,0.55
bdnqxl,Can PTSD make commitment/life changes difficult?,"It’s been almost a year since I was raped, and my husband decided to buy me a wedding ring to make us official. We’ve been married since 2016. I’ve been okay with my hand-me-down ring from his mom. He randomly took me to a jewelry store and had me pick out a ring, and when I realized he was serious, I told him I wanted to wait a bit and “make sure it wasn’t an impulsive buy.” Somethings not right. Idk what’s wrong but I am genuinely opposed to this ring and I don’t know why. I get really anxious about it, lump in my throat, heavy thing in my stomach—all of that stuff. 

He ignored my wishes and bought the ring anyway later and surprised me to be romantic. I tried to talk to him about how I feel and he’s upset.

bdp2tb,"Does anyone here have a spouse with PTSD? I suspect my husband does. Over the course of asking him to get help, he has said some really awful things to me. Has anyone else gone through this?","I am extremely messed up from the things he's said because I took him seriously up until yesterday.  He has made really wild accusations about the way I am treating him and his other loved ones.  When I have tried to talk to him about it he has gotten into a rage. The few times I wouldn't stop defending myself and asking for an explanation,  he turned his rage onto me and said some awful things. 

We are in a really horrible crisis and the work to get me safe has put both of us teetering at nervous breakdown level for 2 years. It looks like he snapped long before I did. I have been training myself in mental toughness for a lifetime and am rock solid in my rational brain in a way that is not common. He has spent little to no time in his life doing stuff like this sober (he stopped smoking weed and drinking,  mental health issues run in the family). When I finally became extremely vulnerable a month ago at the end of the process of getting me safe, things escalated a lot.

I still am not okay with how he treated me/is treating me. In the context of what we went through and the sacrifices he made, I realized it makes the most sense that he has been teetering in a ptsd triggered mode this whole time. He mentioned something along those lines once and my intuition strongly says that's what's happening. I've been asking him about this the whole time and he has said it's not that. We are fully disengaged right now and separated in our home. 

After a few days being separated, it's clear to me he has been being completely irrational with his accusations.  I'm really really pissed. If it does turn out to be ptsd,  which I think is entirely possible, then I would be willing to work on things.  I'm currently still open to our relationship continuing,  but I cannot stay with him long term unless this gets fully addressed.  I'm kind of traumatized by the back and forth with his yelling opposite things. The bad half is a lot like the way my ex father was. I hope things end up okay, before things got really bad, I told him I absolutely needed him to come with me to therapy and he was kind of open to it then. He has made incredible sacrifices for me too and ptsd is not his fault. I'm willing to wait awhile,  but it has to start getting in the works asap. If not, I'm fully ready to get divorced.  I won't live a lifetime with someone who resents me for being physically injured and having needs. As the saying goes, I know what I bring to the table,  so I sure as hell am not afraid to eat alone. 

I don't know exactly what's happening with him, but has anyone gone through having a partner do questionable things because of ptsd? How did you feel? How did you move forward? Just in case anyone is going to ask, what he's done is not abuse level. We are in crazy crazy hard times and it hasn't been like that.",tree_be_free,2019-04-15 20:14:52,3,575,27.33,45.83,62.78,3.1,16.43,13.91,93.74,62.61,22.43,14.78,7.65,1.22,0.35,5.57,0,7.65,5.39,13.91,12.52,5.57,5.91,2.26,23.13,4.7,1.74,2.09,0.52,1.91,5.91,1.57,4,0.87,1.22,0.17,12.17,0.87,0.17,0,5.91,12.7,1.74,1.91,1.22,2.96,1.39,4.52,2.09,0.35,1.22,0.35,2.09,0.52,1.04,0,0.52,7.65,2.43,0.7,1.22,1.91,1.57,5.91,14.78,0.87,15.83,2.43,7.3,6.61,0.7,0.52,0.35,0.17,0.52,0,1.22,0.35,0.17,0.52,0,0,12.52,5.22,2.96,0,0,0.87,0,0,0,2.96,0.35,0.17

bdqhd2,I’m really frustrated with myself (tw - rape and abuse),"I’m really frustrated with myself. I messed up and hurt my partner’s feelings. I’m really frustrated with myself because I don’t know if it’s something he’s willing to patch up and I’m having a hard time with it. 

I was in a verbally and physically abusive relationship that ended just over 2 and a half years ago. The night it ended was truly horrific and has really stuck with me more than anything. He assaulted me and threatened me/people I love with more extreme violence. 

I have since moved an hour away, gotten sober, been really active in pursuing treatment, and am trying to return to some level of normalcy. I was single for the first year and a half because I really did have to focus on myself and processing everything. 

10 months ago I started dating this beautiful soul who put forth a lot of effort to understand me and help me feel safe. I have a lot of issues disclosing anything beyond “my ex did incredibly horrific things to me that I still struggle with and disproportionately blame myself for” so I do think he’s not fully aware of how bad things are for me sometimes. 

A week ago, I had quite probably the worst episode of my entire life. I met a friend for coffee and decided to stay to read after they left. I was having an above average day and was planning on having my partner over that evening. I always look up whenever I hear someone walking and I always seat facing doors so I know when someone is coming. I tend to just smile at people and go back to whatever I was doing. I look up from my book already half smiling and there is my abuser walking in the door with some young girl. 

It felt like someone had pulled all the air out of my lungs. I already feel a lot of guilt for not going to the police, but knowing he’s probably doing the same thing to this girl really got to me. I kept my head down and speed walked out. Once I got to my car, I had the worst panic attack of my life. In the midst of it, I texted my partner that he shouldn’t be with me because I’m unstable and unwell and a garbage person that no one should love. He essentially agreed that it’s too much for him and that he can’t handle being pushed away like that. 

We’ve had minimal contact since, but a lot of what he’s saying boils down to him feeling like I was A- manipulating him by threatening to leave him B- wanted to leave him or C- was using him as an emotional yo-yo. I’m really heartbroken that I made him feel this way and it truly wasn’t my intent. It just felt like in that moment it was easier to shut down entirely than have the inevitable disclosure conversation and have him know what happened to me. I’ve apologized and have been giving him space, but I really want this to work out. I know I really hurt him and it’s well within his rights to never talk to me again. I just wish I was able to communicate to him how afraid I was and how sorry I am. I’m just really frustrated with myself for having such self sabotaging behaviors and being so afraid of emotional intimacy. 

Thanks to anyone who reads this.

bdvoye,The road to recovery,"I've been told the road to recovery is long and hard but as long as you keep taking steps in the right direction you will one day get there. But do you ever feel like you were never given a road? You were given a never ending stretch of broken glass to crawl hands and knees on? That you keep crawling but reality sets in and you know your more likely to bleed out before even getting close to the end of ""the road"". People put these weights on you which make it even harder to crawl and then they ask you why you aren't further along? From your perspective all you see is shards of glass reflecting distorted images of yourself covered in your blood. But from the people watching you they see a beautiful mosaic of rainbow as the light catches the glass. They just don't see why your having such a hard time. Why can't you just see it from their perspective?? Why can't you be better? They just don't possibly see how you could be in so much pain. How could they walk a mile in your shoes if you were never given shoes to begin with??  Why o why must you deafen them with your screams of pain? Don't you see how that affects them?? I scream and I scream asking for someone to carry me to help me on to their road. But alas, you can only go on their road if you pay the toll. The toll of taking all the blame for why your in such pain. For the reason your crawling on broken glass is because it is your fault and o life would be so much easier if you ""stopped playing the victim"". All the times this and other similar things that have been said to you just add more glass to your torturous journey. The next person who dare come close and judge me will have the back on their ankles cut so they must experience the glass. Crawl as I have and not because I want their sympathy but because I want them to take a good look at themselves through all the reflective shards of glass showing how it's like to live through the fun house image that they helped create. Never knowing what they are seeing is correct and filling you with doubt that you ever knew what was what all along. I would rather keep crawling on the broken glass than accept the blame for why I lost my innocence. One day if I ever do make it off the trail of broken glass I will keep a shard in my pocket, not to throw on someone else's trail, but to remember the pain was real and I will never ever let anyone tell me otherwise.",Fatassmatilda,2019-04-16 09:05:45,0,475,36.18,86.78,55.92,10.01,19,9.89,94.32,61.26,19.16,14.53,3.58,0,7.37,0,3.58,4.63,6.32,13.68,8.42,7.58,8,2.74,18.74,4.63,3.16,3.58,0.42,2.11,5.05,1.89,3.16,0.21,0.63,0.21,14.32,0,0.21,0,0,16.63,2.32,4.21,2.74,2.11,3.58,4.21,6.32,2.95,1.05,2.11,2.95,1.47,1.68,0,0,4.21,0.42,1.05,0.63,1.89,0.63,3.58,10.95,1.05,14.53,2.95,7.37,4.42,0.21,0.63,0.21,0.21,0,0,0.42,0,0.42,0,0,0,9.05,3.37,0.63,0,0,2.32,0,0,0.84,1.89,0,0
bdvtwv,I stopped my medication and that was such a bad idea,"I was diagnosed with PTSD in late February, it was a relief to figure out why I had been acting and thinking in ways that were very strange and distressing. I was prescribed a lot of medications. Mirtazapine, Effexor, and Xanax. The medications did help with things like distressing dreams, fear of noises outside my home, getting me to start eating food again, startle reactions reduced. The problem with the medications was that I was very drowsy and forgetful all the time. About 2 days ago I decided that I wanted to start getting more accomplished and quit taking everything except the Effexor, as I knew Effexor wasn’t making me drowsy and drugged up. Ok so 2 days later I am sleep deprived, scared to leave my condo, and generally terrified of everything. I’m right back where I was before I started all the medications, and I had forgotten how bad it was.  I am low functioning with the medication but without it I am a wreck. I took my regular dose of medication just now. It may be a while before my mood stabilized though. I do not like the choices of drugged up and drowsy or a walking ptsd checklist. I am really struggling. The trauma happened in December. I don’t remember most of January or February. My memory loss scares me. I was having  memory loss problems before the ptsd medications. I don’t know if the memory loss is from trauma or the many blows to the head I took in December. I had CT scan originally at the emergency room and saw a neurologist after that. The neurologist sent me to 6 weeks of physical therapy to regain coordination, but never mentioned memory loss and after I completed physical therapy he did not seem concerned about the head injuries.

bdwo63,"The only way I think I can cope with it, and I know it's not a good idea","I was sexually assaulted nine years ago during college. I lost a lot of friends, became socialphobic after that, made new friends who weren't good people, had constant suicidal thoughts, called suicide hotline and it made me feel worse, missed my classes and exams and ended up dropping out of college.

The guy came into my life when I was feeling the most vulnerable. My family was going through financial crisis and I didn't even have the money to fly back and spend time with them during the holiday break. He said he wants to hang out with me and be my company.

I know where he works and I always fantasize about going to his work place and humiliating him in front of everyone. For three years I sent him angry, vengeful, random messages nearly every day. I stopped doing that after realizing how insane I might have seemed.

Time helped me heal but every once in a while when I'm doimg something, all of a sudden I get flashbacks and I get so resentful. I wish him all the misfortune in life because he pretended to be so kind despite knowing what I was going through, and took advantage of me. I keep getting this temptation to send texts but I know it's not a good idea. I just wish he realizes what a disgusting POS he is and I can only hope he isn't doing this to anyone.

Any advice?

I know it sounds so so SO stupid but since then my life has been miserable (had to break up with my gf).I’ve been doing EMDR and stuff which is helping massively to be honest. I’ve had derealization since then. I don’t get that many flashbacks or anything so it might not be as bad as others.

It’s like the day is a checklist in my head, and I’m never relaxed enough to enjoy the present moment. I’m always waiting for the next thing, waiting to be done with everything so I can go to bed. And then I spend the time before I fall asleep dreading doing it all again the next day. I even dread when I get a text from friends saying they’ll be in town for a weekend. I hate feeling obligated to do things, to see people, to work. I just want to lay down. I know this all sounds so morbid. I guess I just can’t really remember the last time I didn’t feel so haunted or bogged down. I feel like a baby AND an old woman at the same time lol. I don’t even know. I guess I just wanted to write this someplace where people would understand.

be3kem,overcoming FEAR,"Been through a very traumatic event a few years ago, and due to ongoing abuse my fear has been amplified as time has gone on...

I never was fearful before this event, and this event/the abuse has led to much stress and fear...

It’s had me worried and in fear about things normally that would never cross my mind... and in my defense, considering all the abuse I’ve gone through, this fear is a natural response to protect myself..

I’m always on guard, for example I asked this coworker of mine to hang out casually... she politely declined, and I showed respect and understanding, yet at some point she got uncomfortable by me simply texting her...

now I’m a bit worried that management will find a way to get me on medication... i know i know, that’s super irrational...

I’ve just had traumatic experiences with a psych ward and medication, authority figures etc...

It’s like I’ve been in fear for so long, that It’s my go-to instinct now. On some level, I'm in fear/on guard about any authority figure finding a way to put me on medication...

be9e19,"in a tough situation tw: abuse, family issues","i live with my mum in a temporary house

we have been technically homeless since late january

before this house was hotels and hostels 

im 23, a girl and autistic and schizophrenic

i suspect i have some sort of ptsd from abuse as a child continuing to now (a whole other post, even though i have repressed a lot. family and outside people were part of it), the physical abuse stopped when i was 15, but the verbal stuff still happens from my mum. i'm not sure and would have to go through a doctor to be sure and have had bad experiences with doctors...

my mum yells at me a lot, gaslights, guilt trips and i finally told her upfront ""it hurts my feelings when you yell at me.""
 she started saying she wasn't yelling and barely yells and that i'm being ungrateful for everything she does. she said yelling is how she shows she cares when she does yell. that's not how you show care or love. she wonders why i have trouble asking her things and why i cower + age regress most of the time and i can't say ""it's because you scare me, i'm afraid of being yelled at."" it feels like if i express that she has hurt my feelings she invalidates them and turns it over to her, how she feels and how i can't imagine how and what she's going through but i do understand. she doesn't have to take it out on me. 

one time she will say how sweet and amazing i am, another time she will say i'm ungrateful and wasteful and ""just like"" her other children she drove away.

she thinks they are bad people and she is the victim of their behaviour, which is partly true, as one has said some things as well but this wasn't unprovoked she sends things like this too. she denies being passive aggressive. she won't take responsibility for her behaviour. 

but i rely on her for some things like help with finances and advocacy (although my sibling has offered to help or find someone that could help with this in the future).

she is planning to move countries soon and is irritated a lot, she tells me she wants to take her life and i comfort her and every time because i don't like seeing people in pain. i say that she hurt my feelings or to not yell at me she says ""i'm not yelling"" or i end up saying sorry for saying that and that i appreciate what she does while apologising a bunch. 

there is a lot more to this but i'm scared she'll find this and say i'm betraying her. so i might delete it in a few hours i'm scared of anyone i know finding it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had PTSD since I was about 7 yrs old.  It took me into my thirties to realize what it was because I couldn't remember the traumatic event and my mother never told me what happened, she just told me I was crazy.  The memory began to surface when I was grieving from miscarriage.   I checked the story with my aunt and she confirmed it.  The memory was that my dad was drunk and threatening to kill me, my sister, my mother, and my mother's fiance with a gun.  I still only remember fragments, but I can tell you it was terrifying to me at that age.

Recently, this is what happened.  

Our beloved cat passed on last week, it was a very peaceful natural death, and last night we were watching a movie called Rachel Getting Married which has some very intense themes.  I had seen it before and there was a scene where a woman confronts her mother and they get into a physical fight. The mother reminds me of mine.

 I started having a flashback of waking up screaming some time after the trauma with my father and doing this on a regular basis as a little kid.  My mother's solution was to come in, slap my face, scream at me, and finally cover my mouth and sit on me to the point I felt like I was suffocating.  I honestly think if she could get away with it, she would have smothered me to death.  I think I was an embarrassment to her.  She has narcissistic traits.  I vaguely remembered this before this flashback, but it always seemed muted, gauzy, and far away.

Any way, last night I had this flashback in the living room right where our kitty passed.  Weird.  I start to wonder if going through the grieving process can leave someone with their guard down and some of these memories come up.  

I am doing ok, but still horrified at my mom.  We have been no contact for about a year for other reasons.  This just confirms for me how toxic the environment growing up was.  Thanks for listening.  Telling my story really helps.",butterflycari,2019-04-17 09:37:40,0,381,45.39,46.85,91.23,1.37,15.24,17.59,91.08,56.43,21,14.96,11.29,1.05,0.26,1.84,0.52,6.04,5.51,12.34,8.66,4.46,5.51,0.79,17.85,4.2,1.57,2.1,0.52,1.05,6.82,1.84,4.99,0.79,1.57,1.05,11.81,3.94,0.79,4.72,1.05,9.97,3.67,2.1,1.31,2.62,0.52,1.84,1.57,0.52,0.79,0.26,2.36,0.52,1.31,0,0.52,6.04,2.1,0.52,1.84,1.05,1.05,8.92,6.04,0.26,15.49,1.84,7.09,6.56,0,0.79,0.52,0,0,1.57,0.26,0,0,0.26,0,0,32.55,6.3,4.46,0,0.52,0,0,0,0,0.79,0,20.47

bebzlw,Therapist hesitant about diagnosing me with PTSD because of other doctor claiming I have post concussion syndrome after car accidents.,"This is my first post ever and because i’ve been a long time lurker I’ve decided to ask for your guys advise because of the great support Reddit gives each other. English is not my first language so bare with me please..

A little bit of background story. Started grown up job which consited of driving a lot. Had 2 car accidents in a short period of time. After the second one I couldnt take anything anymore and felt like I was having a mental meltdown. Worked since i was 14 and couldnt lift a finger after the accident. Felt like I was losing my mind literally. 

Couldnt talk to people normally without crying and wasnt myself anymore. Childhood things arose during therapy sessions like arguing of my parents and molestations from family member. I thought that I outgrew everything but after the accidents I cant live my normal life without thinking about the past, crying and feeling worthless. My love for people and life dissapeard as if was never there and was feeling quite suicidal without wanting to be actually dead for a long while.

Was going to therapy since the beginning. Therapist was thinking about PTSD but after telling her that my normal doctor suspected me from having post concussion syndrome (because of the forgetfulness, headaches dizziness etc) she is waiting for other test i guess to conclude that it really is ptsd.

Im really hopeless and want to do just anything to get better. So my question is can anyone relate to this or what do you advise me to tell my therapist because I really wanted to start EMDR and I feel as if it is going to take forever..

beewgi,My therapist just told me she thinks I have PTSD and I guess things make sense now,"I don't remember any of my childhood, really. I just always remember feeling BAD. I had no peer to peer social interaction outside of school. I always remember feeling alone, weird, isolated, like I could never do anything right. My mom never really hit me, but she affected me emotionally. She's a recovering alcoholic and has been sober since before I was born. I always remember her telling me I was going to be an alcoholic, listening to her crazy rants, her projecting onto me. My therapist told me to look into ""codependency"", and she said it isn't like being clingy. She mentioned how I'm so used to having to walk on eggshells around my mom, always worrying about how SHE feels and thinks and never truly feeling loved.

Last september, I totaled two cars. I'd always had depression, but for the months before september, I remember feeling like I had a handle on things for the first time. I was discovering who I was. The year before that, I just got on ADHD medicine for the first time, as I went undiagnosed all my life. I remember feeling so powerful, knowing that I wasn't really lazy and disgusting, my ADHD and depression just made it impossible for me to really be myself (I'm actually very neat and organized). 

After both of the wrecks, I haven't been myself at all. I just realized that recently. It's like my brain forgot who I am. I've been failing my classes, my room's been a complete mess, I just don't feel like I'm in the world. Nothing feels right. Some days, all the music I listen to just sounds wrong. Nothing to watch on Youtube, no books I want to read, nothing. 

When I had those car wrecks, it took me back to that feeling I've had all my life. I can't do anything right. I felt so alone. Nobody really reached out to me. I don't know what happened in my childhood that made me into a walking trauma. I always feel like the week after I had the first wreck. Like, just out of my body. Waiting for some sense of normalcy. At first, I was weirdly fine. After the first car wreck, I was back at school the day after, laughing and making jokes about the wreck even! I even did my speech for student government. 

I feel so trapped in my own mind. I sleep so much, I write so much, I live in my own fantasy world 99 percent of the time. I literally feel like I died in one of those wrecks. I feel like I'm an empty person. Every reaction I have is just a second off, I feel unreachable by everyone else. Nothing interests me for more than a couple minutes.

MY flashbacky feelings are traumatic acquired from an event 2 years ago, however i no longer get images or memories of this event, i have however internalized my reaction to said event and it has gotten progressively worse, i experience the same feelings as i did during/after the event. I become severely out of touch with reality, it has gotten to the point my obsession is now an obsession with this ''out of touch feeling'', during these episodes i tend to become more spiritually awakened and search for resolutions to ease the distress and mental fog i feel, but this just drags me into the rabbit hole even more. These episodes severely cause inattention, they cause anhedonia, distress, it has gotten to the point that i have almost created a 2nd personality for myself, so the first being my primary (normal) clear headed functional self, and the 2nd personality (evil) associated with intense distress, flashbacks, dissociative feelings, out of touchy feelings and obsession over something in my brain i cannot see, feel, or touch. I believe this is all tied to said event.

What meds will save my life?? i found that while taking Zoloft 200mg standalone it fixed most of my OCD but not the episodes i am discussing in this post, i was than added to combination therapy where my Doctor on top of the Zoloft added a low 25mg dose of Seroquel &amp; 3mg Risperidone. I found that these episodes greatly reduced however they were still imminent at some point in my life, but i managed to go a full 5 months without such episodes, at this stage it was deemed i was ''fixed'', and my doc was very concerned of the metabolic side effects saying i was already at high risk for type 2 diabetes and obesity, so he decided to put me off the antipsychotics. I am still on Zoloft 200mg, and yesterday he added Valium 5 mg.

i found Valium can snap me back into reality for 10-15 minutes before the episode arises again. Such episodes tend to occur around 6:00 - 4:00 am but they rarely if ever happen in the morning/afternoon so i found i need to go to sleep early at night to run away from these episodes. The time of the traumatic event i experienced was 2:00 AM.

I WAS not raped, assaulted, hurt, in fact the trauma was a response to a relatively small subjective experience. These flashbacks do not take the form of smells, images, they take the form of dissociative feelings, bizarre-odd thinking patterns, and a preoccupation with these feelings where my mind OBSESSES on it and it feels like a rabbit hole.

My Diagnosis when discussing these matters with my Psychiatrist was put down as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

befydr,UPDATE: Dealing with being re-victimized [Trigger Warning],"So I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/bdn1gj/dealing_with_being_revictimized_trigger_warning/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) two days ago about my girlfriend making me relive my trauma, and after thinking more I've realized how toxic the relationship was on both fronts.

Her bad mental health made it impossible to talk about her issues without her breaking down, so I was walking on eggshells every moment I was around her. I never felt like I could talk about my emotions and concerns about the relationship without her losing it and turning the conversation to ""I'm awful and you should never be with me,"" Given, she does have intense self-esteem issues, but I think these really contributed to the relationship.

She would trigger me a lot by getting irrationally jealous of things, like me talking about ***any*** of my exes (even the abusive ones) which would trigger me because it would take me back to my old exes and their jealousy. She would also use jealousy as an excuse to have sex, which just triggered me more because I would feel owned. It would make me slip back into the headspace of being a victim, into that weird place where all I could think about was being ""loved"" in that sick way because it was all I'd known. But of course, I could never tell her because she would break down if she ever thought her behaviors was one of my triggers. 

It made me start avoiding her, trying to keep minimal contact but just enough to make her happy because I was afraid of hurting her, just trying to make her happy but hating the feeling I had when I was around her. It felt like I was back in my old relationship, walking on eggshells just to keep my s/o alive.

My therapist helped me realize that I had retreated into my avoidant behaviors from my toxic relationships, and essentially shut off my emotions. I just realized I'd numbed myself to everything and slipped into my old state of trying to make my s/o happy without regard for myself. It scares me how easily I'd slipped back into that state, and how hard it's been for me to identify abusive/unhealthy behavioral patterns. It terrifies me that I'm repressing things again to the level where I can't even identify my own emotions. I don't know what I'm going to do anymore. I don't know why I keep re-victimizing myself. I just wish things were easier.",qiankgs,2019-04-17 18:48:19,0,438,18.38,19.92,67.62,1,25.76,17.81,90.87,57.76,23.06,17.58,13.24,0,0.23,3.88,0.23,5.48,2.74,13.01,9.82,8.45,5.94,2.05,20.09,3.88,1.83,2.28,0.46,1.83,8.22,1.6,5.94,1.6,1.37,0.46,8.9,0,0.46,3.88,0,17.58,3.65,5.71,3.2,1.37,1.83,2.28,1.37,0,0,1.37,2.74,0,1.83,0.23,0.46,5.71,2.05,0.91,1.14,0.46,1.37,5.48,7.99,0.46,11.64,1.6,5.94,4.57,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,0.23,1.14,0,1.14,0,0,0,19.86,4.11,3.2,0.23,0.23,0.23,0,0.68,0.91,2.51,0.91,6.85

The awareness of behavioral &amp; mental health related to veteran suicide is not high enough.

I survived veteran suicide.

However, 20 veterans a day do not survive suicide.

That's about one veteran suicide every 72 minutes everyday.

This is a very alarming crisis.

But basically, with every person I have tried to pursue a relationship with, I start freaking out every time they touch me. I went on a date to the movies a while ago, and when he put his arm around my shoulders I started panicking and I had to leave because I couldn't breathe and I felt like crying. 
Similar things happened in similar situations, where he touches me (whether it be holding my hand, putting his hand on my back, hugging, kiss on the cheek, etc) , just real simple things, I start freaking out. 
I have not gone to a therapist or psychiatrist or anything and have never been diagnosed for anything, my current situation does not let me get that kind of help, but everyone I have talked to has said that I have ""PTSD""-like symptoms from a sexual assault/rape experience. Someone who has experienced a rape has told me that she has the same reactions to people touching her. 
but for me .... It's never happened, not that I can remember, at least. 
So , is it possible to have PTSD from something I never actually experienced ? I am so very confused about this. Any help or advice or insight would be appreciated.

bel3qj,Does having PTSD once make it easier for you to get it again?,"IMPORTANT TO NOTE

1) I HAVE NEVER dealt with a verbally abusive person before and after that woman. The only “bullying” I’ve experienced was when nobody wanted to be my friend in elementary school. 
2) I HAVE HAD PTSD before. I had it when I was 12/13. It developed years after I was sexually abused (age 5-9) by a family friend.

***

I’ve posted about this incident before, but I’ve been thinking for the past week... is my response to the incident overblown, or is it a result of a deeper issue? 

*** 
To sum the incident:
I’m sick. I take a twenty second break while my coworker takes care of the customers. I notice an agitated customer. I assume she’s in a hurry. I call her over to help. She accuses me of not wanting to help her. I tell her that I’m sick. She proceeds to scream in my face, accusing me of not wanting to help her,  not wanting to be there, of daydreaming, and that she hopes I get sent home. I’m left speechless because none of that is true, I literally offered to help her. She continues to repeat the above statements over and over — throughout the entire transaction. I scan her stuff in silence. She gets increasingly aggressive, now pointing in my face. I’m still having a freeze reaction. She leaves once the transaction is over. 

Her friends refused to even look at us for some reason. When my coworker finished, they bolted out of the store without a word. 

***
I didn’t know how to react during and after her explosion. I started experiencing PTSD symptoms two weeks after and I’m still experiencing it almost a year and a half later. I will be seeing a psychiatrist in late May, but for now, I feel like my reaction to this is abnormal. I know there are CS worker who have been sworn at, called derogatory names,  physically assaulted... and they didn’t react as badly.

Do you think developing PTSD from this is somewhat, or does it seems like this incident might of triggered something deeper? Did this incident somehow re-triggered my PTSD?",jazzybluecat,2019-04-18 05:43:50,16,372,46.88,37.35,77.52,11.76,12,16.94,91.94,59.14,20.43,15.05,9.68,0.27,0.54,4.03,0.54,5.38,5.65,15.59,10.75,4.84,4.84,2.42,18.28,4.84,3.76,1.34,3.23,1.08,3.76,1.34,2.42,0,1.34,0,10.75,0.27,0.81,4.3,0,12.63,2.69,3.23,1.61,3.23,0.81,2.69,2.96,0.81,0.81,0.54,1.88,0.54,1.08,0.27,0,6.45,2.42,0.27,3.76,1.34,0,4.84,11.83,0.81,16.13,0.81,4.57,10.48,2.42,0.27,0.54,1.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21.24,8.33,3.76,0.27,0,1.08,0,0.54,0.54,2.96,1.08,2.69

Last night I had a dream that I went back and it was all normal at first until a team of people came in with guns and it happened all over again. I could feel and see a bullet go into my neck and nobody would help me stop bleeding.

I woke up crying and really agitated and had to double check that my neck really was ok in the mirror. How can I stop this from happening again? Are there ways to stop certain dreams from happening?",questionable_apples,2019-04-18 06:20:55,9,153,39.05,13.32,94.72,37.33,17,10.46,90.2,56.86,15.03,9.15,9.15,0,0,0,0,5.88,5.23,12.42,11.76,6.54,7.19,1.96,20.92,3.27,1.31,0.65,1.31,2.61,4.58,2.61,1.96,0,0.65,0.65,2.61,0,0,0,0,8.5,0.65,1.31,1.31,0.65,1.96,2.61,1.31,0.65,0,0.65,3.27,2.61,1.31,0,0,8.5,1.31,1.96,2.61,1.96,2.61,7.19,7.84,0,19.61,2.61,5.88,11.76,2.61,3.92,0,0,0,0,0.65,0,0,0.65,0,0,11.76,3.92,2.61,0,0,1.96,0,0.65,0,1.31,0,1.31
bellrs,"It paid off accepting that people in my life help me in ways they can, even if that isn’t the way I want them to","For most of my life, I’ve been riddled with various mental health issues. It’s caused me to have unrealistic expectations for how friends and family “should” help or offer support for me which, in turn, has caused a lot of issues with people sometimes ending relationships. With PTSD, and now ATSD, I’ve just given up trying to make people follow this unrealistic narrative and accept that person 1 is my fun friend for fun things, not a therapist, or family member 3 is understanding if I have to cancel plans due to ptsd but not someone I can talk to about details. 


That leads to yesterday when I get to my moms house where my nephew is glueing tissue paper onto a chicken cut out for a craft day with grandma. Him and I are going through the bag of goodies he and my mom got at Michael’s and there’s a wiggly squeeze thing that if you squeeze it, it bubbles out. We marvel at how cool his grandma is.


After dropping off my nephew off with his mom, my mom and I are at her house again when she digs the little critter out and says she saw it and “had to get it” because it reminded her of the stress ball I’ve been squeezing lately. (I’m sorry, I don’t English well even as a native speaker) This little dude has little flimsy spikes all over and squishy feet. She said she thought that because it’s easy to squeeze, it’s soft, and it’s long enough to toss from hand to hand, it’d make a great sensory item for me. It’s the coolest thing someone has done/thought of for me and this morning, the next day, I’m overcome with love from her. Even if she sometimes says some really messed up things without thinking, or actually has forgotten my trauma happened, she cares. She supports. She tries. And that’s so important to know. She doesn’t need to be perfect, she doesn’t need to be a balls to the wall activist (though it’d be cool), she’s there in ways she can be and that’s enough.


I think it’s helped me immensely to accept that people help how they can, and sometimes it doesn’t align with what I’d want or do myself, but they’re not me nor are they a licensed mental health professional.",BadJuJuForYou,2019-04-18 06:32:39,4,418,21.87,49.04,29.12,78.39,24.59,13.64,89.23,60.05,21.77,13.4,7.42,0.24,0.24,4.55,0.96,8.37,3.83,14.35,12.2,5.02,8.61,2.39,19.14,4.07,1.2,1.91,0.48,1.2,4.78,3.83,0.96,0.24,0,0.24,13.64,2.39,0.72,5.02,1.44,13.16,2.15,2.39,2.39,4.07,0.48,4.55,3.59,0.24,0.96,2.39,2.15,0.72,1.2,0,0,5.98,2.63,1.2,1.91,1.2,0,3.11,15.55,0.72,10.53,0.96,5.74,3.83,0.72,1.2,0.96,0.24,0,0,0.96,0,0,0.48,0.24,0,17.22,3.83,5.26,0,0,0,0,0,0.96,5.98,0.96,0.24
bemezr,Is irritation just irritation or a sign of something deeper ?,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBUUyOrVWwU

A lot is made of the fact that PTSD makes victims of violence irritable. I was watching this video on irritation and I had mixed feelings about it. I think I can partially agree with Zukav that sometimes these minor irritations are a symptom of deeper issues/fears/traumas and people's trauma being triggered.

The thing is that honestly most people should be doing a lot more for veterans of war, child abuse victims, rape victims (which can include men as well) and prostituted women. People need to stop sending men to war and expecting them to be OK after that. If veterans feel they were unjustly treated and are angry at society for allowing that, that's a valid feeling. If they can't have a relationship with someone who thinks it's alright to send men to war or doesn't want to really hear about the atrocities of war and empathize with you over them (because that would mean they now feel they have to be anti war and that's too much trouble) that's fine that they can't have a relationship with such a person too (which sadly is probably the majority of people who are not anti war). And the same goes for child abuse survivors or rape survivors or prostitution survivors. Most people in society are not really properly supportive on these issues, nor do they really want to hear all about it and empathize with it (that would mean they feel they have to work on the child abuse/rape issue, get the victims justice/stop the abuse to other victims and that's too much work/disruptive to their mind/disruptive to their life) and would not really be a good supportive person to be in a relationship with the victim. Why is the victim always the problem ? Sure the victim is the one in the most pain but... that doesn't mean that they are the problem.

Sometimes I also think that victims become subtly submissive and act like underdogs (because they are, they were subjugated and oppressed) in a subtle ways that other people do not, they come across as low status people and people unconsciously feel entitled to  be unfair to them (I have personally noticed myself doing this to a girl once so I know it can happen) even though everyone is not quite aware of the reason. The victim could be aware that their inability to stand up for themselves and be more assertive/authoritative and demand better treatment and be given fair treatment could be related to their prior trauma and the way they were degraded and placed under oppression. I think that this is some of what is going on sometimes when people feel ""triggered.""

I think that victims will ""heal"" from their PTSD and their irritation when they get a good amount of people around them who are really fighting back against the trauma they went through. e.g. If you are a veteran and got a few good friends who were anti war and were genuinely working to end wars or if your partner was working to end child sexual abuse/child abuse, that could probably make people more safe.",mixedmary,2019-04-18 07:48:10,0,547,44.08,68.91,17.34,1,30.39,17.18,93.24,55.39,14.99,7.13,1.83,0,0.55,0,4.75,7.86,6.22,11.7,11.7,4.75,7.68,1.83,18.28,4.94,2.56,1.83,0.37,2.74,12.07,2.93,9.14,1.28,3.47,0.37,12.98,0,0.37,0.37,0.55,16.64,4.2,1.83,3.11,4.2,0.91,4.94,2.38,0.55,0.37,1.46,1.83,0,0.73,1.1,0,12.61,1.28,1.65,7.68,1.28,1.1,2.74,14.63,0.55,7.5,1.1,3.84,2.74,0.73,0.37,0,0,0,1.46,0.91,0,0.18,0.55,0.18,0,12.8,4.02,1.46,0,0,0.55,0,0,0.73,1.83,2.19,2.01

bepry0,PTSD and unsupportive parents — need help/advice,"I (19 F) am a college student at a liberal arts school on the opposite coast as my childhood home/family. I’m home right now for our spring break and just had a really awful argument with my parents, mostly my mom, and I was hoping I could get some less biased perspectives from people who don’t know those directly involved.

For some background, I’ve never been very close to my parents. My mom and I fought a lot when I was still in high school. She chalked it up to me being a teenager, I chalked it up to our personalities being fairly incompatible. My parents got physical with me a couple of times but I wouldn’t categorize them as abusive in that way. In high school, I would dread going home after school because I knew my mom and I would get into an argument about something. Going to school so far from my hometown has been very liberating for me in a lot of ways, and I’ve always been an independent person, so that’s worked for me very well.

The July before my senior year of high school (so July of 2017), I was raped by my then-best friend while we were high in his basement and I was having a panic attack. I don’t think I’ll ever know what his intentions truly were — I think he was just stupid and hormonal and took it out on me in a negligent way. Doesn’t make it better, but I don’t think he’s an evil person; he just did an evil thing and didn’t know how to handle the aftermath. I had a lot of social influence over him in the aftermath — I was pretty well-liked and respected at my high school, so most people who knew about what happened took my side. Our friendship obviously fell the fuck apart, and I don’t think he ever really understood what he did wrong. It was a pretty well-known thing at my high school (I told a couple people who told a couple of people, you know the rest), so I don’t think I ever really got to process it by myself and on my own terms.

This all happened while he was coming to terms with his identity as a trans boy. I don’t know if there’s a connection there or not; I can see it subconsciously influencing his actions, but that’s the bulk of it. This will become more relevant later.

I’ve struggled with pretty severe depression and anxiety since I was in middle school, and suicidal ideation has been a pretty consistent part of that. It’s just background noise for me most of the time, and as trite as it sounds, I know in my heart that it’s very unlikely I’ll act on my suicidal thoughts. I’ve had seven years to do something serious and I haven’t yet — the suicidal thoughts, while obviously shitty and bothersome, are pretty passive most of the time. Over time, I developed PTSD from my sexual assault.

My parents both work in mental health, but historically aren’t very understanding when it comes to my experience with that stuff. As an example, I was hospitalized on my nineteenth birthday back in February because I was suicidal and my friends were worried about me. I ended up in a psych ward for five days and four nights, or something like that. I had to call them and be like “lol guess where I am” which obviously isn’t the greatest conversation to have. Despite knowing I have literally been hospitalized for depression, my mom doesn’t think I’m depressed (either that, or she just doesn’t want to admit it). She also knows I was raped — when I told her, she was fairly receptive, but also told me that I put myself in that situation and that it was essentially my fault. I’m a pretty private person and I don’t tell people things unless I really feel I have to, especially my parents, because I’m scared they’ll use it against me. I just don’t think she understands the extent of my trauma from that experience. More on that later.

My health has been steadily deteriorating this past month or so of school. About two or three weeks ago, I had a panic attack that elevated into a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure; a friend took me to the ER and I basically got told by the doctor there that I had correctly diagnosed myself and there wasn’t much I could really do besides treat the underlying issue, which is post-traumatic stress. I’ve had several more since, both small and big. The next three or so days, I could barely even walk because my limbs were shaking involuntarily. Like tremors. It would go from gentle, subtle shaking to convulsions that lasted for hours. I couldn’t go to class or do anything. My memory was awful — I’d say something and immediately forget what I was talking about. I couldn’t keep up with conversations. It was hard to even speak, and I just existed in this horrible fog that was half-flashback half-real life; I knew I was safe and nothing was happening, but I couldn’t rationalize or believe it. I was smoking a lot of weed at this point to self-medicate. Later that week, I went to class and could walk, but my memory was still as shitty and full of holes as it had been since the seizure. As an example, I was at breakfast once before I went to class and I was trying to type a header and forgot what my name was for a solid twenty, thirty seconds. It was really fucking scary. There were points where I felt I would pass out, and I constantly just felt like I was dying. I’ve had my share of low moments and low periods, but this one felt very different. It manifested much more physically. There were times when I felt mentally fine and lucid but my body would just give out on me. If anyone said anything that I could connect back to my original assault, I’d delve straight into a panic attack. I felt like I was walking on eggshells. This was during the last few weeks of my semester, so I got my finals deferred until these upcoming couple of weeks (we have a term after second semester where we just take one class, it’s weird).

I was talking to my therapist at school and she recommended that I do an IOP this summer while I work (I’m planning on living in the same town as my college, sharing an apartment with two or three other people, and working full-time; I have a job lined up and everything). Daunting, but obviously a good idea. I’m on my parents’ health insurance, so I’d need to talk about it with them, but it’s a very touchy subject, especially since mental health coverage out of state is fairly iffy. I was dreading bringing it up. I also got a medical marijuana card for my PTSD, because it was recommended for my seizures.

Last night, I smoked a bowl because I felt panicky and was planning on going to bed afterwards, but my mom found out and absolutely lost it. I told her it was recommended to me by several different professionals and she didn’t care at all. I told her I have PTSD from being raped and she said I let it happen to me and continue to let people abuse me and it’s my fault and I’m throwing my life away (direct quote is “you let yourself be abused and then you’re surprised when it happens again”).

She thinks the reason I’m so fucked up over what happened is because my rapist was trans. That’s what she said last night. She thinks that it’s causing me to have an identity crisis because someone who was “insecure” about their gender identity forced said insecurity on me and I don’t know how to deal with it. She was talking about how it’s a hard time to be my age because there’s “all these genders and sexualities” defacing our culture and confusing young people (I’m also bisexual myself, so that was like.. ouch), and said she thought that if he wasn’t a “female to male insecure about his sexuality,” this wouldn’t be happening. Which I disagree with, obviously. She already knew I smoked pot 2-3 times a week — she didn’t have a problem with it recreationally, but once I brought up using it to medicate my anxiety, she flipped her shit. She told me I let my rapist abuse me. I brought up that I’ve been struggling a lot with post-traumatic stress and she was like, “What’s even happened to you that traumatized you?” so I had to explain that I really was adversely affected by my assault to the point of a PTSD diagnosis. I think she just thinks I’m using it as an excuse. She told me I’m abusing the medical system and that I’m manipulative and abusive and using real diseases as a means to get what I want (which would be attention I guess?). She then brought up my hospital stay in February and said, “Who’s paying for you to be in the hospital all the time? It’s not about to be me.” She then said she doesn’t want to help pay for my education anymore if I’m “like this.” Which is fine. She’s not under any obligation to pay for my college.

I eventually brought up my therapist’s idea that I do an IOP. My mom lost it. She was like “those are for people who CAN’T LIVE ON THEIR OWN. Are you that suicidal all the time?” and I was like no, because I’m not. And she kept talking about how she wasn’t spending her money on that and how I was gonna come home and live at home where she could watch over me all the time. Again, she doesn’t have to spend money on me, but if this were any other medical issue I think she’d be a lot more flexible and gentle with me. I think she’s just really ashamed about what it stems from. Pride is a big thing for her and she’s very adamant that she didn’t raise me to be so insecure and reactive. She just kept talking about how much I’d damaged her trust and that I inflicted this on myself.

I leave for school again on Saturday but I really honestly don’t want to come back home after that. I might fly back earlier if I can. I’m miserable at home — my city is already pretty tainted for me because I spent so much time here with the guy who ended up assaulting me, and this was just the icing on the cake at this point. I just don’t really know what to do next, nor do I know how to appraise the situation. I can’t tell if I’m being overly reactive or if this actually is a shitty situation. My plan as of right now is to go back to school, finish up the year, and work this summer/basically save up as much money as possible. Ideally, I’d like to do the treatment program, but it’s super fucking expensive and if my parents aren’t willing to help me pay for it, I won’t be able to do it. I don’t know if I’ll go back to school, but I don’t want to live at home. I’d love to make it so that I’m not financially dependent on my parents anymore but that’s obviously a long and messy process with a lot of different steps. I have about $2k saved right now from when I worked in high school, so it’s not like I have nothing, but I’m still feeling really at a loss in terms of what to do next. Basically, I packed for my flight with the intention of not coming home again, and it was a weird feeling. Even if I am completely overreacting, I still don’t think my relationship with my mom is healthy.

I’m really lucky. I have a pretty strong social support system and other adults that I can turn to who know certain parts of my situation. I’m from an upper-middle class family and attend a competitive private school. I have a lot of resources and I don’t really know how to utilize them most effectively as I try and make a life for myself. I know I have a lot to give and offer the world — I’m a really accomplished writer and my writing has been recognized/praised by a lot of different important people in the industry — but I just don’t really know what to do next, especially if I end up not being in school anymore.

Am I doing the right thing for myself by aspiring to be financially independent? Am I making this all up? I just feel very stuck and lost. I’m pretty confident in my capability to live by myself and take care of myself, I’ve been eons happier living by myself than I ever was living at home. This conversation was a long time coming, but that doesn’t make it hurt any less. Any thoughts or advice anyone has would be really really appreciated. I don’t know how to do what’s best for myself right now. My PTSD is really bad and I need support, and if it’s not coming from my parents that’s fine, but it still fucking hurts. And maybe I’m just being really rash and impulsive and everything will be fine and I’ll stay in school and maintain a relationship with my parents, but this feels founded in something very real. I don’t know what to do.

tl;dr: I have pretty severe PTSD that requires extensive medical treatment and my mom believes I brought the stressor on myself and is thus not super supportive in my recovery process. It reached a breaking point this week and I’m trying to decide if I should just say fuck it and try to become completely financially dependent on myself.

Thanks so much for reading. I can’t tell you how much I would appreciate literally anyone’s thoughts on my situation. Much love :)",aouzisi,2019-04-18 12:39:10,8,2397,15.34,15.23,89.65,9.4,20.14,15.23,94.28,61.49,22.11,15.1,11.89,0.29,0.38,2.25,0.29,7.01,4.34,12.56,11.97,6.8,8.8,2.46,20.48,4.76,2.59,2,0.92,2.21,6.47,2.54,3.88,1.08,1.38,0.5,8.3,0.88,0.17,2.09,0.67,14.89,3.25,2.13,1.92,3.5,1.42,4.46,1.38,0.08,0.5,0.71,2.75,0.29,1.59,0.58,0.25,6.76,1.54,1.34,3.09,0.83,0.46,6.38,11.51,1.13,13.14,1.59,6.17,5.59,2.42,0.21,0.58,0.63,0,0.25,0.71,0.42,0.13,0.04,0.13,0,15.85,4.71,3.5,0.04,0.25,0.25,0,0.5,0.75,4.88,0.75,0.21
ber1ve,Confused about my memories,"Hi y'all, I was diagnosed with PTSD a couple years ago due to physical abuse at the hands of my parents and sexual abuse at the hands of a neighbor when I was 13. The diagnosis made a lot of behaviors ive always had make a lot of sense. However, some of the behaviors that are specific to childhood sexual abuse were present before the incident when I was 13. I know there is a lot of controversy about repressed memories, however this isn't entirely that. I've always had memories of my dad coming into my room at night, probably until I was 10, and getting into bed with me, I have memories of waking up when he wrapped his arms of me, and smelling alcohol on his breath. The memories kind of stop there.  I never really thought about it much until recently, when it occurred to me that that sort of thing isn't exactly normal. Is it at all possible that I have repressed some sort of sexual abuse at his hands?",frankieteardroppp,2019-04-18 14:34:34,1,177,54.94,19.85,98.7,1,19.67,19.21,95.48,57.63,18.08,12.43,9.6,0,0.56,2.26,0,5.65,6.21,17.51,9.04,7.91,6.21,1.69,12.43,2.82,1.13,2.26,1.69,5.08,3.95,0,3.95,1.69,2.26,0,5.08,1.13,0.56,0,2.82,19.77,5.65,1.13,0,6.21,3.95,2.82,2.82,0,0,1.69,6.78,2.82,2.26,1.69,0.56,3.39,1.69,0,0.56,0.56,0.56,5.08,6.78,0.56,18.64,1.69,6.21,10.73,0,0.56,1.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.3,3.95,4.52,0,0,0.56,0,0,0,2.26,0,0

berkq7,Something interesting a therapist told me,"(rape tw) Tl;Dr vivid dreams can be traumatic so bring them up with a therapist if needed (it's a bit more than that though)

So technically I have 3 therapy options that I'm using right now. I'm waiting for an NHS based therapy service while having therapy at my uni while I wait and also have a mentor which helps with my uni work but is also a therapist at the same time. This week I went for an initial assessment at the NHS service and as they already had a lot of info about me it turned into a semi counseling session as they needed a bit more info but also wanted to make sure I was ok.

Anyway one of my traumas came from when I was raped and as it happened 2 years ago I'd just blocked it off mentally but it resurfaced recently after a similar situation happened to me. I wasn't harmed and the other person had no ill intentions but it just brought it up to the surface and fucked me up. I'm basing reliving it now so I brought it up with this therapist.

However I also have very vivid dreams and in one dream I was raped by my dad. I'm extremely lucky as my parents have never hurt me in any way (the PTSD is just from many uncontrollable traumatic events) but this dream has made me sort of scared of my dad. I brought this up with the therapist and surprisingly she said that extremely vivid dreams can also be traumatic and change your mental health. I don't think they meant it as you can get PTSD from a dream but that if you're already struggling with your PTSD, vivid dreams can make it worse. 

So that was a bit comforting as I thought I was crazy for being scared of my dad over a dream. I'm also really anxious about this one road because of a different traumatic dream which is kinda funny to me. So maybe if I have another dream in the future that fucks me up a bit, I'll talk about it rather than push it aside.

beu71d,Coping strategies,"I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, after finally receiving professional help. When triggered I can suffer panic attacks or just completely shut down. Usually, to cope I try to just breathe and calm my mind, but sometimes even if I do that it gets to a point where I start hyperventilating to the point where I get lightheaded and I can’t feel my arms and I think I’m going to pass out. If the trigger is more subtle, I can completely shut down, and it’s in such a subtle unnoticeable way that nobody notices (can vary in how noticeable it is) This is equally as bad as the ‘shut down’ can last from anywhere between a few hours to a few days and almost always impacts my education and relationship.

bev9je,PTSD COURT UPDATE #(not sure),"It’s been months since my last update.  For good reasons.  I’ve been functional, as hell.  I haven’t felt like this since before my first deployment in 06.  

I get up and go to sleep on a schedule, eat better, have cut back on smoking massively, and have been able to go out to social events without needing to use alcohol.  The biggest change has been the decrease in my severe, crippling anxiety.

Other people I care about and respect have noticed as well.  

I’ve have two breakdowns since my last post.  Very different than my 2-3 a week for the past decade.  During one freakout, my friend just stopped  and said “man, are you ok? You seem like you’re having a panic attack.  Want a fucking hug?”

I’m a bigger guy, 6-1, 230-240, lots of tattoos. It fucking sucked that I couldn’t have anyone not be just plan scared of me when I was having a panic attack.  Especially with my background of getting PTSD from war trauma.  

I’m 100% convinced that if I had not made personal progress that this guy had seen for over a year, he would have written me off too.

Fuck, that meant the world to me.

Besides the small wins, I’ve had some big ones.

I graduated culinary school (Jan 28th)

I graduated court ( March 14th)

I graduated my EMTB course (April 7th)

Started a new relationship that is healthy and honest (about 3 months now)

Moved into a new place I love and can afford (April 12)

The best part about just saying fuck it and really getting help?

My father got diagnosed with ALS about 6 months after my DUI.  I didn’t really talk about it in my posts, because it’s my dad.  Before I started to this whole thing I would have been a drain on him.  I couldn’t of helped, I was a complete mess.  A few days ago the house went under contract and the sell with help him pay medical bills and get the help he needs for a rough few years.

I was in charge of the remodel and sell my fathers house adding 120k+ in value (as long as the contract goes through.  Sell date is May 7th).  

Through all this stuff I’ve cried, confronted and trying to claw my way out of this fucking PTSD pit.  That dark, lonely, “Im a piece of shit, this is why this happened” pit.  About half way through, my dad trusted me to handle this.  

He would have never done that before, I couldn’t have handled it before.  

Progress is fucking progress guys.  

I never dreamed I could be someone my family could rely on.  Someone my friends should respect.  A person who was drowned in trauma and swam up.

Now I can be me and not my trauma.  That person is amazing to me.  I’m so proud of him.

bewq8l,Lots of changes. Could use someone to talk to.,"I have had a lot of changes lately. I was diagnosed with PTSD over 2 years ago, but I was unable to continue therapy because I lost my insurance.

When I got it back a couple months ago, I was able to start seeing a psychiatrist (though it took months to get in). I was prescribed Wellbutrin and a dog. I was also prescribed psychological testing to see if I have anything else wrong with me.

I adopted a lovely 5 year old German Shepherd on Friday, and he is a joy. I had my intake, which takes place prior to testing, today. She signed me up for therapy, which I start early May, and a support group for Child Sexual Abuse, Human Trafficking, and Domestic Violence. She said this is because I have the trifecta of CSA, physical abuse, and neglect as a child. Once my insurance approves psychological testing I will get that done.

She was so validating, and that is so foreign to me. She said I spent so many years with rage and distracting myself to repress my feelings that it caused me to be forced to deal with them, which is why I have not been the same with PTSD. 

I am on the path to healing. But I feel overwhelmed and lost and upset. I just want to cry and be sad and also happy, but I don't know how to open up to those around me. I often feel broken, but I am trying so hard to fix myself.

bexgh6,when does it stop being just heartache and become PTSD ?,"TW : abortion, divorce, drug addiction

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my story. 

I had a rough childhood (various abuse, mentally ill father, did a lot of stupid things as a teenager to cope, blablabla). I didn't have a diagnosis but I suspect I was bordering on BPD disorder for a long time. Anyway, it all seemed to get a bit better when I met a really amazing man. We decided to get married after a few years. We talked about wanting kids in the near future. One week before the wedding, I find out I'm pregnant (not planned). He freaks out, and tells me there is no way we can have that baby. Blames it on financial issues but it was really not impossible to make it work. I was conflicted as it was kind of a bad timing indeed, but not TOO BAD to actually be positive we couldn't make it work. Anyway, with the pressure of the wedding etc, I figured it was indeed better to just have an abortion and try again in a few months when our situation would be more ideal. 

Thing is I changed my mind. But it was too late. I had a fucking nightmare few weeks after that. Crying for hours, feeling like I lost a part of my very soul. Guilt, anger and resentment towards my now husband. I thought it got better for a while but I started to just dull the trauma with alcohol and cocaine. It just spiralled down from there. 

We divorced a few months later as he couldn't handle seeing me in that state and I eventually started cheating on him in the end to get some sort of revenge I think. It was totally cruel and inappropriate. I lost almost all of my friends as they sided with him (understandably). It's been a bit more than 3 years. I am just now starting to find my way back to myself. 

My question is, what can define a line between a ""normal"" response to a traumatic event, and ptsd. I still have dreams, very vivid dreams in which I relive the whole ordeal. I still have moments when I find myself having panic attacks just thinking about that time of my life. Towards the end I became so full of anger and despair that I said awful, awful things to my husband (""I wish you were dead""...don't think it can get worse than that) and I sometimes hear myself say those words in my head at the most unexpected times.

I just feel so stupid because it's not such a brutal trauma in my opinion but I am so tired of not being able to forget those horrible things I had to go through. I feel like I will never be able to trust anyone again or forgive myself for the way I reacted to the situation.",BetsyZZZ,2019-04-19 03:06:32,2,490,37.77,23.75,91.36,1,16.33,15.1,94.29,59.59,18.57,12.45,10,1.22,0.2,0.82,0.2,6.12,6.33,13.06,8.78,8.78,6.33,2.24,16.53,7.96,4.08,1.22,0.41,3.27,8.16,1.63,6.53,0.82,2.65,1.02,7.76,2.04,0.2,0,1.63,14.29,4.29,1.22,1.43,2.86,1.43,3.67,1.84,0.41,0.61,0.82,2.45,0.2,2.04,0.82,0.2,8.16,2.65,2.65,0.61,1.84,1.02,5.31,10,0.82,13.47,0.41,4.9,8.37,0.61,0.61,0,0.2,0.2,0.2,1.22,0.41,0,0.41,0,0.41,15.31,6.53,3.47,0.2,0.41,0.2,0,0,0.82,1.63,1.63,0.41

I was working on these index cards of all my past experiences - there were thousands of them, good and bad - and what I would do was write the experience down, then write the feelings I had at the time, and the feelings I have now about it.

For example:

&gt;I got my first job when I was 18.

&gt;Feelings then: like an adult, responsible, fear, financial stability, structure

&gt;Feelings now: glad I had it, learned useful skills, helped me to stick to something

bf4i77,Could it be..?,"I apologize if you guys get these posts a lot. I know a message board can't diagnose me but I'm seriously wondering if there's more to my mental health issues than what I've discovered so far. 

I've dealt with depression and anxiety for more than half my life, since I was 14. That's nothing new. However things took a bad turn when I entered adulthood. I became pregnant and moved in with my ex husband 10 years ago. After my son was born I became depressed and anxious, yes, I chalked it up to PPD however, I particularly could not deal with the constant crying and being needed constantly. By couldn't deal with it I mean, I would fly into rages, scream, slam doors, punch walls. It was like a switch flipped and this rage would overtake me and it was terrible and I couldn't stop it. I always walked away from the baby first, this was never directed *at* the baby nor did I feel resentful, but was triggered by him nonetheless. I would be overcome with guilt afterwards, I was confused and thought I was a terrible mother. 

I went on to have 2 more children in the next 3 years and in that time eventually got on an antidepressant, which helped...

The other issue is relationships. Specifically living with someone. Having someone in my space all the time makes me feel...on edge to the extreme. Incredibly irritable, the littlest thing makes me snap, I feel like my senses are in overdrive. I was this way with my ex and we had a ton of other issues, and I ultimately blamed it on our uncompatibility. Fast forward to my current relationship, who I mesh with and get along with SO well. Everything between us is perfect, I feel completely comfortable with him. I would spend all my time with him anyway so we decided to move in together.

And as soon as I did that, I feel those same feelings coming back. I feel prickly, on edge, I'm irritable and snappy, I want to pull away and withdraw, I find myself looking at him as  a bad guy, when that's not how it is.  Even the dogs running around are overstimulating to me. Oddly enough not my children (they irritate me sometimes in a normal way, like kids will do, it doesn't feel the same at all).

Nothing would have made me thing ptsd until I read an article a friend posted about a mother with ptsd, and found I could relate to it to a t, except for the flashbacks. Then I read an in depth article about C-PTSD and emotional flashbacks, and thought oh shit. My dad was rough/physically and emotionally abusive growing up, particularly when I was a teen. Bad anger issues, constantly picking on me and generally being a bully. That was a big reason my anxiety peaked as a teen, I had bad anxiety attacks, derealization, took to self harm, etc. I suppose that's enough to be traumatic especially when I look back to how bad it was. Add to that the fact that I have always tended to daydream excessively, still do when my symptoms are bad. A common theme to these daydreams are being hurt or in danger and someone helping me. That has been a theme since I was a kid.

bf6p8s,A 5yo with PTSD,"My 5yo daughter was recently diagnosed with PTSD and severe separation anxiety. Her father killed himself in front of her nearly two years ago. She was alone with him for at least an hour before I found them. 

She has severe behavioral issues at school now, and severe anxiety at home. At home, if I’m out of sight for just a few minutes she will have a panic attack. I mean, just taking out the trash or doing the laundry sends her sobbing in fear that I’ve died. 

At school, her anxiety seems to manifest as anger. She pushes, hits, throws things, hurts other kids, tries to run away. She’s already had to leave one school and was suspended a couple of weeks ago from her new one. Yesterday was so bad she bruised a teacher’s stomach, pulled another’s hair out, threw a chair at the kids, scared some of them so badly they hid under tables, and then she *choked* one of the kids. When they removed her so she couldn’t hurt any of the kids or the teachers, she started clawing at herself and digging into her own arms.

I have her in regular therapy, music therapy, and a sport (I thought physical activity would help as an outlet). But things seem to be getting worse? I’m so alarmed and shocked by the choking (where would she even learn that) and self harm. Is this kind of rage “normal”? Her next therapy appointment isn’t until Wednesday, so I have what feels like ages until I can bring this up. 

I feel awful and so incredibly sad for her, I feel horrible for the people in her school that she’s hurt, I feel like I’m failing everyone at every point. I’ve suggested taking her out of school, but her therapist and even the school director think that will hurt her more, but I’m concerned about the physical violence to those around her. Does anyone have any experience with this? Any suggestions I might look into for her?",IamnotCountOlaf,2019-04-19 18:01:52,29,341,51.21,72.12,28.52,1,16.24,15.54,93.84,56.01,19.06,14.96,4.99,0,0,8.8,1.17,4.11,5.57,15.54,8.8,4.99,8.21,0.59,16.42,5.87,2.64,0.88,1.17,2.64,9.09,0,8.8,2.35,1.17,2.35,14.08,0.59,0,8.5,0.88,9.97,3.52,0,1.17,3.81,0.59,2.64,3.52,0.59,0.29,2.35,3.23,0.59,2.64,0,0,4.69,0.29,0.59,2.35,0.88,1.47,3.81,10.56,1.17,16.42,2.93,7.62,5.87,3.23,0.59,0.88,0,0,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.6,4.69,5.87,0,0,1.17,0,0,0.59,3.52,1.17,0.59

bf8czx,NSFW - Trigger Warning (Murder/Suicide) Grief and Resultant Trauma,"Hello everyone.

Awhile back I had posted asking for advice on how to help my LD girlfriend, who had been suffering from chronic PTSD. We had decided to take a break late January this year as she needed time to regather herself outside of the confines of a relationship.

We had dated for roughly two years. It's a long and very complex story. I'm afraid too complex to post here. But long story short, she was rooming with a man who had Schizophrenia. He had tried killing himself several times before and she was trying to help him get ahold of himself. I was not aware of his issues but I did know that she had been suicidal in the past as well. 

I guess he had held suicide over her as a way to keep her around. Well, we had kept talking after our break. Still told each other we loved one another. Every day we'd talk. She finally mentioned she had plans to move to my state and that just warmed me up like you wouldn't believe. And a week later her friend shot her in the head while she was sleeping before killing himself.

I've never felt more empty and hollow in my life. The last three weeks have been filled with nightmares. I wake up at 3:00 to 4:30 every morning unable to fall back asleep. I've never met her family, but now they are all over my Facebook and I'm flying to them for the coming memorial. Contact with them has helped. I can't imagine how they feel and I feel like I'm no help because I'm completely destroyed by all of this. I get that therapy might help here. But what else? Whenever I start feel like maybe I'm doing okay images and thoughts just nail me. I need something because I feel I'm going to lose myself in grief.",Pixels_N_Stuff,2019-04-19 21:16:33,0,327,25.96,76.85,71.82,3.06,12.58,14.98,95.41,58.72,21.41,17.43,7.95,1.83,0.31,6.12,1.22,3.98,3.36,14.07,10.7,6.73,6.73,1.83,20.8,4.89,3.36,1.83,2.14,2.45,5.5,1.53,3.98,0.31,1.22,1.53,17.43,0.31,0.92,3.98,2.45,13.15,3.98,1.83,0.92,1.53,2.45,2.45,2.14,0.31,0,1.83,2.75,1.22,1.22,0,0,10.09,5.5,1.83,2.75,0.92,0.61,9.17,9.17,1.22,17.13,1.53,6.42,8.87,0.31,0.61,0.61,0,0,2.75,1.22,0,0.31,0.31,0.61,0,14.37,7.34,1.22,0.61,0,0.31,0,0.31,0,3.67,0.61,0.31

bf93mh,I'm not really sure... [NSFW],"Preface: I'm not looking for an official diagnosis, I understand that a doctor is only good way to fully diagnose. And note that I am currently in a safe environment and in no way am in danger. The only issue is the mental issues. Also here's my trigger warning if you're reading to read.

               I've been having a lot of issues recently. I... need a public place to vent where things can stay anonymous. It's been getting worse recently but I've had what I can only assume is depression anxiety and PTSD which left untreated for the last 7 or 8 years as I do not have a good way to get to a doctor. I self harmed for years but stopped after Thanksgiving (American holiday) in 2017. But since before that I've been having an issue where occasionally I would have violent flashbacks of my abusive father and self harm and feel like I'm back in those moments and then to only get shot back into reality starring into nothing while in the midst of a panic attack. It didn't happen all the time and would usually be a few days up to a few weeks apart but recently it has become common and happens 1 or 2 to 3 or 4 times, if bad, a day. This mixed with a constant depressive feeling of dread, depression, and regression has made everything incredibly hard to deal with and I've start to crack recently and break down more often.

bf9h62,How do I sleep? tw,"I have never been a good sleeper. I have two major traumas that I can think of associated with sleep. One, I woke up to being sexually assaulted when I was 19.

The other is from childhood. My parents were abusive and my dad was an alcoholic. They always fought, especially at night. I can remember being three years old and them waking me and my sister up with their screaming, fighting in our bedroom doorway, my mom breaking a porcelain wall decor thing over his head.

So when I lay my head down to sleep, it all comes rushing back. Sometimes I hear doors slamming or yelling. 

So I avoid it like hell. I do whatever I can do avoid it and sort of just tire myself out until I pass out every night. I’m up until 7am. Every night. I’m lucky because I work from home and it’s not a big deal if I sleep in, but I don’t want to continue wasting my days and I feel like I’m missing out on regular life.

I’ve even tried Ativan, it used to work but lately it does nothing.

I also have bipolar disorder and fibromyalgia so maintaining a healthy sleep schedule is a big part of keeping my symptoms at bay but I’m doing a horrible job.

bfa8ho,Do people assume you’re “dumb” or “slow” because of trauma symptoms?,"
Do people assume you’re “dumb” or “slow” because of trauma symptoms?

I’ve been called slow and dumb my whole life. A lot of people think I am ditzy and an airhead. Often I’m not aware what is going on in the present moment because I am in my head (anxiety, dissociation, ruminating thoughts). I often will have slow responses to people because I am emotionally dysregulated, I was distracting myself and/or hypervigilant as I try to read the person/situation (I try to figure out if I am safe and can trust them). When I get dysregulated, I often freeze and forget what I am doing. I know my cPTSD symptoms are a big reason I appear “slow” because when I take a mood stabler, a lot of those symptoms go away. I also I wonder if having cPTSD for so long had changed my brain so I am slower and have a slower processing speed.
It bothers me a lot when I get patronized and treated like I’m slow/dumb. Sometimes people think I am lying when I say I went to graduate school. Also, sometimes I attract manipulative, insecure and sexist men who like to feel like they are superior and try to infantilize me because they think I’m
Slow and inferior.

bfaf89,Summary of me: I crave for validation from abusers,"I value myself based on how abusers see/value me. I desperately seek attention and approval from them.

I recently quit my job just after two days because I clearly found that my bosses and senior employees are narcissists -They have no morals.

I wrote an I'm-leaving-email to Project Manager. And then I noticed my so very unrealistic and secret desire: I wished he tried to convince me to stay. Ugh! This desire sounds quite sick. I was leaving an abuser and why do I want them to beg me to stay?

as a background, ive been abused (a lot) and all ive been talking about and looking forward to is moving out and being on my own away from my family and town. im so so close to being able to move out, just one more year! i keep getting the inevitable “youre not going to like being an adult as much as you think you will” but i think im in a different situation.
so adults, i know the symptoms of ptsd wont magically go away once i grow up and leave, but was it easier to cope or recover once you moved out?",anon16218,2019-04-20 07:41:02,11,134,41.72,22.78,99,25.77,26.8,11.19,93.28,59.7,14.18,12.69,9.7,0,2.99,0,0,1.49,5.22,17.91,14.18,3.73,12.69,2.24,26.12,7.46,5.97,0,2.24,3.73,4.48,2.24,2.24,0,0.75,0.75,6.72,0.75,0,0,0,11.19,2.99,0,0.75,2.24,2.24,5.22,1.49,0.75,0,0,0.75,0,0.75,0,0,5.22,0.75,2.24,0.75,1.49,0.75,2.99,14.93,2.99,18.66,5.97,9.7,4.48,0,1.49,0.75,0,0,0,0.75,0,0.75,0,0,0,10.45,1.49,3.73,0,0,1.49,0.75,0,1.49,0,1.49,0
bfczlx,PTSD story: How I Became a Heroin Addicted Clown (motivational TragiComedy),"If you are sensitive to hearing about violence or sexual violence, please don’t watch this...it may “kick your shit up.”

Honestly, it bothers me as the title, in this particular forum,  makes it feel “gimmicky”
But this is basically the story of how &amp; why my life collapsed.

At this point in time, I’m a ptsd ridden social recluse, who doesn’t talk to anyone on the phone or through email (no family or friends by choice.’

There are many things that led to this, but the events described in this story are definitely some of them. 

Others have been described in other videos ( notably the suicide attempt video / leaving an abusive relationship / heroin horror story / why I am a recluse)


When I say clown, I am serious, haha, as to the profession ... and the clown ethos and learning to laugh at the horrible things that have happened is something that’s important to me and is the reason my brain hasn’t been completed destroyed by now.

bfgof9,"TW suicide, relationships, assault... does this happen to anyone else?","My main trauma is childhood abuse, but recently my ptsd symptoms have been linked to my ex boyfriends death. He killed himself two years ago, and I have close relationships with others who have been suicidal or who have serious mental health issues. I worry about my siblings killing themselves for no rational reason. My current bf was hospitalized for wanting to kill himself twice within the past year, my mother has been hospitalized, many friends struggle with thoughts and I’ve been hospitalized for ptsd episode/suicidal thoughts last fall.

Everyone currently in my life who i worry most about is recovering and thriving, and I still completely freak out when something is even a tiny bit off.
When I call my bf or my mom and it goes straight to voicemail, all I can think of is the scene of my former bfs lifeless body on his bed. I think immediately of for example, my mom in the same way. Dead somewhere. I think of the funeral, the grief feelings come back, how I would probably have to be sectioned again.... picturing the dead body the whole thing. The flashbacks for this are more intense than the ones of abuse i faced as a kid or the time I was assaulted, and I wasn’t even close in proximity to my ex when he passed.
I just called my current bf, it went to voicemail because he has no service at work, and all these grief feelings come flooding back.
The phone going straight to voicemail has become a massive trigger. I haven’t got to a place with my therapist yet where I can talk about it, and I’m so stuck. I’ve been able to prevent myself from crazy behaviors used for contacting my bf and family when I worry about them (for the most part) but it still will send me into a panic.

Glimpses at the past recognize it’s been there for some time, but differently, more short-term. When the monsters finally broke through, they took me down. A place where I haven’t seen a fraction of light for me, for my future, for so long I can’t even recall the last time I felt the warmth of light. 

Not today though. Telling the monsters to f-off for the day. The sun is bright and warm, the breeze just right. I stood in it, let it soak in to me. Took deep breaths to pull in the breeze and allowed it to cushion the spastic thoughts of hell, calm the frantic innards. 

It’s not happy, I don’t remember what that is, but it’s something. Something outside of hell. And I’m taking it. For today. Almost let myself hope for it to last for tomorrow, but stopped myself.

bfihwn,Challenges in the bedroom after PTSD.... Anyone else? Sorry in advance if tmi.,"My husband and I both are suffering from acute trigger symptoms, a few weeks post a major trauma that happened to us. I don't think it's likely that either of us will have serious issues long-term but this thing just happened and finally ended. We both are really interested in having sex but we've been through a lot and are both dealing with triggers from our past that arose in addition to the crisis. The triggers from the past interfere with relaxing in our current relationship, on both sides.  

So far we successfully made out and have been getting past first base. I kind of feel like we should almost approach the situation at the speed that we did when we first started dating. We are married, been together three years and extremely close and very deeply in love. We both agreed we want to take things slow. Each of our triggers made the other person insecure and for about two weeks after the major event ended we both were not in a good place. Neither of us could ground the other and we both kinda freaked out. 

We've been getting really good quality time in together just being able to hang out and reintegrate into our life. We've been able to  communicate about things to start making the other person feel more secure. This has been hard but also is going fantastic and I am so so happy for us!!!

 I'm just grateful that I feel secure in my present again and sex is a low priority to me over this. But try telling my body that! I want him constantly and so does he. The bad situation it's finally over. We got through it! And as a much stronger and more intimate team now. It's been a long time because of health issues during the crisis. God I just want him constantly, even when I know we both don't want to do it. My sex drive is the kind that runs semi independent of my emotions.  I've always been like that. :/

Has anyone else dealt with sex troubles after a trauma, even when the problems are not between you and your partner? We've been through a lot. It would just be great to hear other people have struggled through the frustration of wanting to do it so bad but also not being ready, for reasons outside the relationship. Just so I don't feel alone or weird. We both have agreed that we want to take things slow but the urges on both sides are also really powerful.

bfilsd,Dizziness - anyone else? How to help?,"Hi there, I’m not sure if the “advice” tag means I’ll be giving advice or asking for it, but I’m definitely looking for it. 

I have a lot of trauma. A very unstable upbringing and three separate accounts of sexual abuse, two of those instances were performed by family members when I was a child and the third when I was 18 years old. I have been working very hard in therapy (once a week for three years) and feel like I’ve finally broken really important ground on the unstable childhood aspect. I think that my body and my brain have made enough room for me to start really dealing with the sexual trauma in a big way. And it is ruining my life. 

I’ve found that my more recent symptoms with vivid flashbacks and memories that were foggy before is a VERY intense dizziness. It is completely debilitating. I cannot drive, leave the couch - anything. I feel like I’m going to be sick if I try. The dizziness has occurred before, but never like this. 

I need advice on how to bounce back. I’ve tried appealing the young parts by watching TV shows from my childhood (this usually works, but isn’t now). I’ve tried drinking water. I’ve tried grounding exercises. But I am still unable to move. Does anyone have any advice?

bfjnh4,New Triggers Causing Another Side Of Me,"Hi,

I am new to reddit and stumbled across a post that I found helpful about living with ptsd in a relationship. I was in a previous relationship where I was verbally and physically abused. We were together for far too long. I finally grew the courage to escape. I changed my job, address, phone and cut off any friends that my ex and I had in common. I needed a fresh start.

I took some time to heal my heart and soul. I eventually found a very understanding, caring and loving man that accepted me, even with my broken wings (what I call my major relationship baggage). We have been together now for 4 years. We have been doing well with our normal relationship bumps, even with my constant panic attacks/ anxiety/ bad days.

But we are planning a major move and found out I have some triggers that I didn't know existed. Moving is so stressful, especially cross country. We have had 2 bad arguments which lead to him saying certain words that my ex would say when we used to fight. My current boyfriend is so good to me and not remotely abusive (mentally or physically) but when he unknowingly said the words that my ex would say to me I have found myself being taken over. I feel like I am back in a fight with my ex. I have shoved my current boyfriend and slapped my boyfriend yesterday.

I am so incredibly ashamed! He reacted by leaving our apartment each time to get space. I literally ran him away. He would never hurt me and I know he is not my ex. I can't believe that I ever laid my hands on him. There is no excuse for it. I don't know how to explain this to myself let alone him. I am a peaceful person that avoids confrontation at all costs.

Has this happened to anybody else and can anybody please give me advice on how to deal with these new triggers?! I love my boyfriend so much and don't want to run him away!",hippiejess91,2019-04-20 18:32:39,0,358,18.46,47.77,94.73,8.89,13.26,17.04,94.97,57.26,22.91,18.16,13.41,2.23,0,2.51,0,4.75,2.79,10.89,9.22,6.42,6.42,2.23,18.99,3.35,0.28,1.96,0.56,1.96,8.1,3.35,4.75,1.4,1.96,0.56,15.08,0,1.4,0,3.91,12.85,3.35,2.79,1.4,1.96,1.4,2.23,2.23,0,1.4,0.84,1.96,0.56,1.12,0,0,10.06,6.42,0.56,1.12,1.12,1.12,7.54,10.61,0.56,15.64,3.07,6.42,5.87,0.56,0.28,0.56,0.28,0.28,0,1.96,0,0.28,0,0.28,0,12.29,6.42,1.96,0,0,0.28,0.84,0,0,1.12,1.12,0.56
bfjr97,Insomnia and ptsd,"I've always been an insomniac, but I'd just fall asleep when I got tired, and sleep great.

After my event, since the brunt of it was going to sleep in a panic attack, waking up to every creak or sound that night.

Now my insomnia isn't worse, except falling asleep is where I will push through for days to not let my eyes close jacked up on coffee.

There is not a moment of the day where I will not have coffee within reach.

To comfort myself to get a nap in I have to have  protection for myself and take naps at random random times.

bfksz2,I'm only seeing the negative and feeling too hard. Help.,"Recently my partner and i got into a fight because i misinterpret everything someone close to him says. He says i always find the negative in things and it is true. Its easier for me to see the bad side of things and i do default to it. 

He told me its too hard to talk to me about it sometimes because i react so intensely and it makes sense why this person is avoiding me. 

It feels hard because i never felt like i was allowed to have feelings before. My entire childhood growing up. So when i went through therapy and i felt safe enough to feel like i could express them it felt like i was letting open a dam and so all of my feelings are strong and probably too much for most people.

I dont think i can change the intensity of my emotions. But i know i can look at situations in a different light. I just dont know how to do that.

bfnx66,Mixture of trauma and guilt preventing me from living normally (TW: COCSA),"I've recently started coming to terms with the abuse I suffered as a young child at the hands of my ""best friend."" It went on for a long time and was usually physical and emotional (she hit me a lot and basically criticised me until I felt like I needed her to feel ""whole"", regularly abused me to prevent me from making other friends. She just wanted me to be completely dependent on her, and I was) but was occasionally sexual. I don't want to go into details but I blocked it out of my memory for a long time, meaning I had symptoms (panic attacks, vague nightmares) but I couldn't remember the cause.

It was okay till I hit puberty, but as soon as I started feeling sexual desire I was hit with waves of shame, fear, and severe anxiety. I threw up after my first kiss and I'm still a virgin (I'm 19.) It's taken me so long to remember and understand what happened to me and I'm still too scared to bring it up with my therapist (I don't have a professional PTSD diagnosis, but a lot of my symptoms match up.) I don't think I can ever tell my parents, because they'll never stop blaming themselves and I can't do that to them.

All that's bad enough, but I'm a lesbian, too. I know there's nothing wrong with me, but when I feel attracted to women I can't help but feel like I'm wrong, or disgusting, or dirty for it. I didn't even grow up religious, and my family is totally accepting of me. Everything just feels like it's closing in on me and I feel like I'll be okay. I feel like I'm broken.

I used to get A/Bs and once I started uni (prior to my trauma happening) was getting High Distinctions and Distinctions (Australian University equivalent to As and Bs) after that I stopped doing all my assignments altogether and now that I’ve started doing them I’m only barely passing, and still waiting till the last minute. I assumed I was just dumb somehow and never realised before, because when doing the assignments I don’t realise I’m doing any worse than I normally am.

But then talking to a friend who was explaining why he quit work due to ptsd, he explained that no matter what he did his work achievements went down because of ptsd and I realised that maybe my marks going down isn’t just me suddenly becoming an idiot.

Does anyone that knows a lot on the topic know if ptsd could be why my marks are being effected even if upon appearance they don’t seem to be? And if this will improve over time?

bfojin,I just need someone to talk to.,"I’ve been married for 9 years this may. My marriage has had plenty of ups and downs, but we have always came out on top, together. But this time I just don’t know how we are going to get through it. 

  It all started a year ago after my surgery to remove a tumor from my spine. I was kinda useless around the house and my wife picked up the slack big time. I, in the mean time, threw myself into video games. It hurt our relationship big time because once I was able to help around the house I didn’t. I snapped out of it a few months ago, but the damage had been done. To pile more onto the failing bridge between us, my son and I do not get along very well. Like at all. We both have done some really fucked up shit to each other and we both need therapy to get over it. So my house is usually a war zone between me and him, and my wife and other two kids are caught in the crossfire. 

  Since I came to my senses a few months ago I’ve been trying my damnedest to be a better dad. A better husband and better person in general. I love my family. I love my wife. I love my kids. But something has always made it hard. Something kept interrupting my attempts to be in a better mood, to walk away from conflict and to be compassionate towards my wife and children. Finally it hit me like a ton of bricks last week. I have PTSD. 

  Talking to a few doctors and answering all the questions related to mental illness with many yes’. I was confused and surprised. I’ve never been subjected to what some of my Marine Corps brothers and sisters have. I’ve never been injured in combat. Never even had to shoot at anyone during my 3 combat deployments. So I never even considered it. I figured it was just depression, or I was nervous. Or I was just tired or hungry or a thousand other things. But now I’m faced with what is really wrong with me. 

  My wife had asked me to leave the house a week ago, because she no longer loved me. I had alienated her from the home. Too many times I let my anger control my mouth. Feelings have been shredded by my words and my actions.  My kids have suffered under my controlling ways. I was angry at first. I’ve been trying so hard. I’ve done so well. Then I talked to the doctors. The realization of what was wrong but also what I’ve done has broken my heart. 

All I see in front of me is loneliness, my life being torn apart and having no control over any of it. I tore it apart. I was the problem. And now I’m so scared I’m just making things worse. I want to be better. I want to know how to love the right way. I want my children to understand I love them. That I’m proud of them. I want my best friend back. My wife was my rock. I don’t blame her for her decision. And now I’m lost in this sea of uncertainty. 

  How do I fix this. How do I make things right for my family. How do I forgive myself for all the hurt I’ve caused. For being so stupid. For being so naïve to what I was suffering from and causing others to suffer with me.  I never meant to be so bad. My intentions were good. So many unanswerable questions.",MoHawkMarine,2019-04-21 05:58:38,4,615,22.11,16.05,96.26,7.18,10.08,11.38,94.96,61.3,21.79,16.59,14.47,0.98,0,0.81,0.33,5.2,4.39,13.5,11.87,6.67,7.48,1.79,18.37,4.88,2.11,1.63,0.98,3.25,7.97,3.09,4.72,0.65,1.46,1.63,9.11,2.44,0.16,1.79,0.81,14.15,2.6,2.93,1.14,3.25,1.95,3.25,1.3,0.33,0,0.81,3.41,0.81,1.46,0.16,0.16,11.38,5.04,2.28,3.25,1.63,0.98,7.64,9.92,0.49,13.33,1.46,6.18,5.85,0.65,0.81,1.14,0,0,0.16,1.14,0.49,0.16,0.16,0.33,0,14.47,9.92,1.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.76,0,0
bfpnk8,"(25F,) insecure about my (28M) boyfriend (and ex-heroin addict) when we go to parties.","Last night - my boyfriend became upset at me when I mentioned I noticed one of his friends smelled like coke and I asked him if he had done any. He said that I “don’t trust him” and even if he had, if it didn’t affect me, it was “none of my business.”

The second comment bothered me on an emotional level which he later said he understood why. 

I became a little upset by this statement but he wasn’t wrong. We’ve been in a relationship for two years which started not long after he got clean from drugs. Additionally, with my abusive father being an alcoholic and frequent drug user, I am very sensitive around people who have/continue to use substances. I had to stop this myself because it was giving me so much anxiety.

Currently, I am in therapy (have PTSD from being raped a couple years ago) and am trying to figure out ways to be more accepting.

But from a non-biased stand point - I’m not sure what to do. Being honest the second I feel it is important, but I just don’t want to discourage him as a person because he has made a lot of strides to get better.

The horse reminded me of my dog that passed away two years ago. When my puppy was in pain in his last two months, It hurt so bad to see him like that. I think all the abuse I went through has made me more distrustful and in some ways (depending on the person) less compassionate of people. 

But this does not hold true with animals as I trust them (specifically dogs). I feel so comfortable around dogs and horses because I know they won’t purposely try to hurt me. I feel the say way around young kids (4 years old and younger). I am more comfortable being myself around them because I do not feel judged and they are genuine and honest. 

I really want to to try animal therapy to work on my attachment issues and trauma. Has anyone ever tried Equestrian therapy or other animal therapy? Anyone else also sympathize more with animals than humans? 

Note: I want to add that I am working on therapy to work through my trauma so I can be less guarded. I think once I start being more trusting and open, I will feel more connected and loving towards humans as a whole.

bfpzju,A Walking Amnesiac,"Does anyone else have no ability to make memories? I don't remember anything, nothing episodic at least. I can remember semantics and if I tell myself something enough times I'll hopefully remember it. But when I try to think back to even yesterday, there's just a void. I might remember the fact that I went somewhere but I won't actually be able to recall a memory about it. There's just nothing there. I've always been this way (I know not because of memories but because of stories I've told myself). I never really thought about it being weird until I was in college but now I I know it's definitely not the norm. I have ptsd but I don't actually remember what happened. I grew up in an abusive home until I was 17.

Does anyone else experience this? Particularly to the degree of nothing being remembered? I feel. Like a walking amnesiac.

bfq142,Too Much Fear,"Most of the time I feel like I'm doing so much better, but then the fear hits me all at once... I'm having the toughest weekend.

I have PTSD related to trusting men, and I'm
having the worst weekend dealing with it right now.

A lot of times I'm able to convince myself that I'm OK... I have a good job, live in a big city, I'm attractive and have great friends. But when it comes to guys and dating, I feel completely helpless.

It's hard for me to view my dad, who I trusted, as a terrifying abuser, and so I project that onto all other men. I have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that not all men are like that, and are likely not as abusive, manipulative or harmful as my dad. 

My dad comes across as the perfect guy... moral, sociable, successful. His public
image is sparkling clean. No men I meet measure up to his ""perfection"" on the surface. It's just hard to move past that, and to realize how many great and trustworthy guys are around me.

I was afraid to leave my house this
morning because I didn't want to run into any of my guy friends. Sometimes I feel the biggest terror towards all of them. I feel
stupid for saying that and weak for feeling so
afraid. I just needed to vent.

On a side note, I would love to
join a support group related to this. I feel like I need people I can talk to about this in real life.

bfr80k,I was diagnosed with PTSD a few weeks ago and now have to stop treatments already.,"I went to a psychiatrist because shits just getting out of hand. PTSD isn't my only problem. I was also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and re- diagnosed with schizoeffective disorder. He seemed very surprised that no other doctor, therapist or psychiatrist in my life has said PTSD for stuff from my childhood. The other thing that happened was when I was an adult. I'm being vague, I know, I don't want to talk about what happened. Sorry.

I'm 24 and was still on my dad insurance. Things have been so bad for me that I'm on disability and can't currently work. I was really trying to improve my situation. I was setting up psychiatrist appointments, therapist appointments, doctor appointments. I really want to get better. But my father's company shut down and with his many losses include loss of insurance. So I'm also without insurance now. I can't do doctor appointment, psychiatrist appointment, anything like that. No medication for me too. My asthma inhaler is running low and I have no idea what to do. I can get on Medicare starting in June so it's really just pushed back but it's still very frustrating. I apparently have to switch therapist (I've been with one for 2 years) and this whole process is so confusing.

I just want to get better and be self-sufficient and it just keeps getting harder. 

On top of all this I have very few friends and my mom and sister just moved out of state. So now I'm the only one from my family left in this state. I live with a very loving, caring boyfriend. He tries but he just doesn't understand the stuff I go through. I don't always feel like talk about things with him.

bfrnny,I feel out of touch with my body sexually.,"So I just subbed here b/c I thought this sub might be a good place to get some answers. 

I (24 pan F) was sexually assaulted a little over a year ago. I'm no longer repulsed by my body like I used to be which is a huge step. But now I just can't turn myself on nor feel turned on by my partner. Alongside PTSD, I have body dyshopria and pretty chronic dissociative symptoms.

I didn't really know what to call this feeling so searching ""I'm out of touch with my body"" or "" I feel no sexual sensation"" or ""porn doesn't turn me on anymore"" or ""I feel sexual dissociation"" didn't yield the results I was hoping for.

I'm trying to explore sensations in new ways like putting ice cubes on my skin, trying diff kinds of porn, etc. Nothing really works. I was just hoping someone here might be able to give me some info on how to get through this, what has worked for you if youve shared this experience or send resources that might help me navigate this. 

Its really taking a toll on my sexual and spiritual well being bc i often do feel detached from myself in other way too (as mentioned above I have dissociation). And my confidence as well. I just feel... empty. I want to be able to celebrate my sexuality and feel comfortable with my body!

bftuzs,Husband is having a nervous breakdown from over working himself through his ptsd. I've alerted his family. Mom just praised him for working so hard and told him to keep his eye on the goal of graduating!!! Anyone else deal with unsupportive family?,"I feel like I'm in fucking crazy town right now. She told me she has a bad memory but that was fucking nuts. I literally just called her two weeks ago and told her how he was breaking mentally and she was completely on board with calling him and telling him to stop working so hard. She was super concerned on the phone with me and said this was a really big deal and he needed to not be pushing himself like this.

The way these people act on the phone with him I'm starting to understand his attitude on things. What the fuck. And we showed them the portfolio I've been helping him work on and the only thing they said was how shity his bio picture is. Which is what I was working on. These people have no sense of anything we're going through. Oh my God this is crazy. Now I have no idea what I should be supportive of but I'm still listening to his request to be supportive of him finishing school.

They are in their own little world and just talked constantly about situations that were painful for me that they know about and have acknowledged were horrible times for me. And they just went on and on about the family vacation they're going on with his sister without us. I am going to go with my gut and say these people are insensitive to mental health issues or literally anything bad. It has been really hard because there have been a lot of people around me who have seems crazy to me lately. It could be that I am the weird one but I have been riding and all of these forums and people have been telling me that the other things I was saying we're not normal. It all makes sense with the way my husband acts completely neglectful of absolutely everything that goes on with him.

I definitely see where his attitude about being perfect all the time comes from. This was completely unhelpful for our situation in a billion ways. This woman has also both told me about his ex wife abusing him AND told me she had no idea it happened. I'm in fucking crazy town right now. She has had a nervous breakdown and is diagnosed with a lot of different issues so who knows what's going on with her. Her abusive mom also just died and she says everything is fine so who knows!!??? 

This has been complete bullshit and now I am going to bear down on these problems we are going through as if it's just me and him and the few resources that I know I can rely on from my own support network. My husband had a lot of issues before we met and it's obvious to me that he did not get support in his environment prior to our relationship.

A little background — I had chronic long-term trauma by my NPD mom. It wasn’t a one-time event. 
Sometimes (happened the other day while I was driving) I will kind of stare ahead with my eyes unfocused and I become extremely aware of my breathing and heart beat. 
I am slightly aware when I do this and I will mentally shrug it off like “whatever” but eventually I’ll shake out of it intentionally. For example, when I did this driving, it scared me. I had another person in the car, and I began doing this at a red light and shook out of it when it turned green, knowing I needed to alert myself while driving. 
Now I think a very important thing to note is that I was COMPLETELY exhausted, and these sorts of spells happen when I am exhausted. So it may be absolutely nothing but my body being tired. 
I was just hoping to get some advice here about it.

bfuo5o,"Stunted Growth - Trigger Warning violence, war","I was listening to a PBS Special about the victims of Columbine. One of the victims said he realizes that the trauma set his development as a person back five or ten years. Another person was saying how she tries to explain to people how the event of sitting in the library for three hours was so psychologically scarring. She asks people to imagine sitting in a library, waiting to die, for three hours.

When I was thirteen, I was a civilian in a sudden war while visiting my family. Every day bombs rained down near our neighborhood, and for weeks I thought we were next. The mantra was, ""if you hear the bombs, that's good, that means you aren't dead."" It wasn't just the bombs rattled me. Hundreds of F16s circled our area all day, every day, and they would fly faster than sound and create immense sonic booms. I spent weeks waiting to die. It was like someone took a hammer to my brain. I got home and couldn't focus on my homework, couldn't retain information so tests became difficult to take, and my emotional regulation was seriously damaged. I stopped sleeping. I developed an eating disorder as a young adult that took so much energy from me. I made so many irrational decisions throughout my life that I feel I would not have made if I hadn't been traumatized so much as a child. 

I am twenty six now. It really does feel like I am five or ten years behind. Everything I was supposed to be when I was a teenager, I finally am becoming. My career is five or ten years behind my peers. I used to be such a bright kid, and then everything suddenly became hard and I'm still not used to this person I am. 

It's like someone put my soul and mind under water and it so it can't walk like normal, but instead it has to wade through water. Everything is slow. Everything feels labored. I don't sleep like a normal person. I don't think like a normal person. I feel broken.

bfuz3g,Need help with girlfriend with past sexual/physical abuse,"So, I've been seeing my GF for about an 10 months now and things have been mostly good.

Long story short, her ex came from the same small village I did and was involved in a violent crime that left a man dead. He is an all around piece of shit and emotionally/physically/sexually abused her. 

On top of this, when this initially happened many people from my village and surrounding villages sent her messages calling her a murderer, bitch, etc. 

Anyways, we've had awesome sex on many occasions but as of about 2 months ago she's shelled up. She tells me the reason is she feels completely insecure with anybody other than her daughter or herself touching her. 

This along with recurring thoughts about his abusive behaviour have caused her problems at work also, which is honestly much more important IMO than her sex life right now.

Obviously I want to help  this girl very much and I want her go to get back to the way when I met her. I feel bad sometimes because I get frustrated that I cannot express my desire (sex) or my lust for her. I really do think she's the sexist thing on two legs and would love to take her to dinner again, or for her to not worry about her work because she's having trouble concentrating at her desk. 

I just want to give her a hug again.

bfwczh,PTSD from moving to new country as a child?????,"I'm 33 female. I only recently realized I might have had PTSD all through my teenage years and didn't know it. It effects me now the most. Ive read somewhere that you can have PTSD from moving from another country as a child is that true? 

When I moved I was 8 years old, I was being raised by my grandparents since I was 4-5yrs because my mother felt she was too young to raise me as a single mom (she had me at 20)I was close to my aunt and uncle and I had friends in this country that I played with every day. 
When I was 7, my mother decides to come back into my life and 2 months later she gets married to my current stepdad. They then moved to the West and a year later my mom decides to come back and get me and live with them.
Okay I'll summarize now..
So basically within a year,.my mom came back into my life, I got a new ""dad"" who I hated then because I felt he was taking my mom away from me, I came to a new country and had to learn a new language and compared to my home country - I was now very isolated. I was sad I wouldnt see my grandparents and relatives. I remember the feeling the next morning when I woke up and calling for my grandma. It was heartbreaking. So i dont know...is all this considered PTSD? 


Now that I'm married, I can't help but create strong feelings of hate and anger in my head when I have to deal with my husband's family and his relatives. I hate the fact that he has all this large extended family members and I don't. I get jealous when I see them interact with out kids and my kids see their cousins from husband's side. I get extremely depressed because my kids don't have cousins and relatives from my side of the family and it feels like it's always about husband's family and their culture and religion.  And I feel it's not fair because I am from a different background too and I want my kids to know where I come from too but I know they won't ever be interested in my side of the family because I don't have relatives/cousins to give them so they will grow up being closer to husband's family/nieces/nephews and that annoys me.

bfwrz2,Do I have it or is it all in my head?,"I wasnt officially diagnosed with PTSD but a psychiatrist/therapist person I went to a few years back told me I showed all the symptoms and I could very well have it but I had to stop going after due to money issues. 

My main incident happened between late 2015 to early 2016. But that seemed to be my neurological breaking point if that makes sense. I already had alot from my childhood happen to that time in late 2015 anyways. So I guess that huge incident caused my mental health to just crash? Does that make sense? Could it be true? It was a few very traumatic experiences (to me anyways) in that time frame (late 2015 to early 2016). 

I still have bad panic attacks, dreams that aren't really nightmares like waking up and screaming but dreams that are like torturing me. Like slowly burning a hole in my head. Now they dont always happen but when they do, it messes with me for a while. I still have bad flashbacks to multiple incidents and panic/anxiety attacks caused by those experiences. 

Sometimes I feel like it's all in my head. Like if I just eat better, exercise, spend more time with my fiancé and our son that itll all go away and be just fine. Even though many times before all that never helped, maybe I'm not trying enough?

I'm new to this sub and I contemplated even thinking about this sub because I dont think I have it. I never was in a very serious car crash like my fiancé and she has PTSD. I was never in the military and in a war. So how can I have PTSD? My mind must be just playing tricks on me. These intrusive and obsessive thoughts dont go away. It kills me from the inside out.

bfxojj,Conflicted about disability income,"I used to be a workaholic. Mostly it was the source of my self-esteem. Like I could be a valuable person if I was the *best,* most dependable employee. I lived like that for years. But PTSD developed along with some other issues and I slowly fell apart. 

When I last had a job, I was a hysterical mess most of the time. My employer/coworkers hated me because they didn't think I pulled my own weight. I missed more work than I went in for, and struggled through the easiest tasks. My therapist begged me to apply for disability, but I resisted for almost a year. Tried switching jobs, no improvement. Finally I admitted I couldn't handle working anymore, quit, and applied for SSDI.

That was more than 2 years ago. Two years of no income meant losing our home and moving in with my mom, which I hate. It meant living on the cheapest groceries we could find, which I'm so sick of it's ridiculous. It's been so stressful and miserable. I couldn't get a lawyer to take my case and had to represent myself, which was a nightmare, even though my medical team unanimously backs it. But every time I gave up and tried to get back to work it was worse and I made maybe a couple hundred dollars in two years. So I slowly accepted that I can't work. Not now, anyway, I need to be able to focus on recovery. That means time and some sort of livable means that allow me the freedom to focus on my health. Eventually the lack of income took away my treatment options too. I lost my medications and my therapy both.

Well yesterday I got approved. I'm so unbelievably relieved. I'll have an income and healthcare and be able to move out of my mom's. It's the best news I've gotten in decades. But after a few hours of happiness I'm just so low. At first I thought it was just exhaustion from the elevated mood, but it's getting worse, for like 36 hours now.

It’s not particularly loud, but you can hear TVs upstairs and conversations. I don’t want to talk to anyone and their voices trigger an instant jump even when I know they’re coming.

I am now 33, and a throwaway comment a few months ago triggered my PTSD and I feel like I’ve been dealing with it on/off since then...it’s like I have a home cinema in my head replaying the same scene over and over, from the exterior I appear to be functioning I look just the same yet it’s polluting the inside and becoming more toxic and I feel worn down constantly battling with myself not to resort to my negative coping strategies as I know it isn’t the answer. 
I have had counselling a few years back...yet that opened things I knew deep down but till you say them out loud then you can’t deny them any longer such as the grooming aspect for example I always knew he did this and it’s hard to deal with knowing someone did that deliberately to hurt you physically and mentally for their sexual gain.

bg0ptt,I freaked out over a birthday gift. Can books be triggering?,"Two years ago my boyfriend gave me a play that means a lot to him. He said a lot of it reminds him of me, but the thing is, a lot of the play has to do with mental illness. 

I do have PTSD, and it was a lot worse then than it is now, but I never wanted to define myself by it. I did hallucinate sometimes, and when it got really bad I'd even hide under the table, but I'm not proud of those moments, and it's much easier to deal with life if I move on and try not to think about how crazy I look while having a flashback. 

So it was pretty upsetting to realise that maybe he sees me primarily as someone who is mentally ill. It doesn't help that the character who reminds him of me is told to shut up and quit whining. But my boyfriend wasn't comfortable with me giving it away, saying that someday he'd like his own copy. So I kept it for two years and tried not to think about it. 

Yesterday we took everything off the bookshelves, and as soon as I saw the play, all those old feelings came back. I felt as if giving me this play was a message that I don't hate myself enough. That character was like a caricature of me at my worst moments, and as I'm recovering pretty well, I'd like to put that behind me. I tried to give the play to my boyfriend, but he looked sad and insisted that it was a gift from him to me. 

He explained that the play was so special that he didn't even show it to some of his best friends. He thought it was one of the most thoughtful gifts possible, from anyone, and that he believed I was clever enough to appreciate it as he does. Also, when I saw myself in that character, I'd realise that all my painful thoughts are just words, and then they'll stop hurting me. And lastly, he told me to get rid of the play, but after hearing all this, I feel so guilty and absolutely despise myself. 

All the same, there were lines like ""You can only kill yourself if you're not already dead"" and ""No one can hate me more than I hate myself"". The author was someone who lived with pain and was used to it, and she did commit suicide. I was going to counselling in order to stop feeling suicidal. I was trying to do anything possible not to be mentally ill, and this gift felt like a slap in the face. It still does, but I wonder, is my feeling justified at all? Am I terribly ungrateful and dramatic about this?",coastofmongolia,2019-04-22 03:59:18,6,475,20.63,27.08,58.67,29.28,19.79,13.26,94.11,64.21,24,14.53,9.89,0.21,0.63,3.58,0.21,9.47,5.05,14.11,10.11,5.68,9.47,2.32,19.37,5.26,4.42,1.26,0.84,2.74,8.21,4.21,4,0.42,1.05,0.63,9.68,0,0.84,0.21,4,14.53,3.58,0.84,0.84,4.84,1.89,4.21,4.21,1.26,0.84,1.89,1.89,0.21,1.68,0,0,5.89,1.47,1.68,1.26,0.84,1.26,8.42,9.05,1.26,9.05,0.84,3.16,5.05,0.63,2.11,0,0,0,0.84,0.63,0.21,0,0.21,0.21,0,14.11,4.42,5.47,0,0,0.63,0,0,0.84,2.74,0,0

When I was 19 (12 years ago) I lost my best friend to suicide. It has fucked me up. I have always had suicidal ideation.. Tried to kill myself 3 times.
My father attempted suicide when I was 1 child. Also. i met a guy a year ago that was kind of in the same mindset as me. We talked for a long time. Ended up spending a night together but as fucked up as I was I realized he was just bringing me down so I cut all Contact. A few months ago he reached out to me but in a really creepy way, and I told him to go away because I was trying to get better.
Today I Learned he killed himself.
I'm feeling so fucking bad about this. I know, as a suicidal person, that no one is ever responsible for this shit.
But I learned that his fuckinh parents helped him kill himself. Like.... I know. When someone really wants this there is no way of stopping them. But helping them????

bg2m0e,"I just freaked out on someone I was about to sleep with, and now I feel like the scum of the earth - NSFW/TW","TW: sex, abusive relationship 

First off, I want it noted that I have never been sexually assaulted or abused. My ptsd comes from an incredibly physically/emotionally/mentally abusive relationship.

Basically, I escaped from my ex last August. I haven’t had sex since before I left her, but there is someone I’m waiting for and want to be with. That situation is complicated though, and I don’t know if it will ever eventuate. 

Anyway, my best friend convinced me to go out tonight. She was going to see her new boyfriend (who I hadn’t met), at a house warming party for *his* best friend. It was just us four (two girls, two guys), and I only decided at the last minute that I would go. My best friend and her bf had kind of organised that if I wanted to have sex with the other guy, since it’s almost been 10 months, everything would be in place. *(Oh my god, that sounds so bad, but I don’t know how else to word it lmao)*.

So here I am, and the guy is really cute and nice. As the night starts, I’m super into him and want to go there. But then he starts getting drunk, and it was an instant turn-off. I started pulling away, talking to my best friend and her bf more, etc; still being polite, but trying to convey that I wasn’t interested. I feel exhausted and emotionally drained, and just needed some space, so I went inside and chilled in one of the bedrooms. Then the guy comes in, and he is literally just leaning over me and staring at my phone as I scroll through insta. I’m pretty short with him and avoid talking, because inside I am absolutely FREAKING out, but he just gets closer and closer. He puts his head on my boobs, but then gets up to see if my friend and her bf were still outside. Then he comes back in and jokingly slapped me across each side on my face. I curl into myself and put my arm up in a protective way as he goes in to kiss me, and I just curl into myself even more. He realised something was wrong, and put his arms around me, asking if I was okay. I just begged him to go get my friend, and he left. She then came in, calmed me down, and pretty much put me to bed lol. 

He’s ignored me for the rest of the night (I’m in the lounge room), and I just feel fucking awful. He won’t even look at me. I feel like I lead him on with how I looked - I did look *mighty* fine tonight* - and also acted earlier in the night. It just sucks because I actually would have gone there with him until he got drunk. And then the overbearing attitude and playful slaps just sent me into full blown panic/flashback mode. 

I actually fucking hate myself. I feel like the most awful feeling in existence for embarrassing him, and making him feel rejected. I want to vomit because I loathe myself so much. I think it all came down to not feeling in control - if I was the one who was initiating everything, that would have been okay because it meant I wouldn’t feel pressured to do anything. My ex did that so much, and made me feel like I was absolute garbage if I tried to say no. So I really think it does boil down to that. But now I’m in a house I don’t feel welcome, with absolutely no way to get home right now, listening to my best friend and her bf fuck. Awesome. 

I really should have stayed home. All I want is to see my therapist. So shoutout to my fucking ex for continuing to fuck me up even when she’s not around - really appreciate it.",sproutinglife,2019-04-22 07:16:23,8,679,21.58,19.25,90.91,23.47,16.98,12.96,94.26,60.82,20.77,16.49,11.93,0.15,0,4.42,0,4.27,2.95,14.14,8.25,7.66,10.46,1.91,20.03,4.71,2.8,0.74,1.03,1.47,7.22,3.53,3.68,0.59,1.62,0.15,10.46,0,2.36,1.47,4.42,13.7,2.95,1.91,2.8,2.65,1.33,3.98,3.53,1.03,0.74,1.77,3.24,0.88,0.59,1.47,0.29,8.1,2.8,1.62,2.95,1.62,0.74,5.89,11.05,1.62,17.38,3.39,8.69,5.6,0.29,0.74,1.03,0,0.15,0,3.83,1.47,1.03,0.74,0.15,0.15,17.67,5.74,5.6,0.15,0.15,0,0,0.88,0,2.36,1.18,1.62
bg3o4e,New father struggling,"I have cptsd, borderline, major depressive disorder, anxiety and depression as well as bi polar. 

I recently became a father 4 weeks ago. It has been both the most amazing thing that has happened to me and given me great joy and hope as well as scares me to death and has caused me to feel almost like a ghost. 

Over the past few weeks we’ve had visitors coming in from all over the place to see the baby. All her family and friends. 

We moved across the country last September to start our new lives together. The mother of my child and I. I am out here with no support group. Haven’t made my friends. I have no family here. 

Since the baby has arrived sleep has been tough for both of us. My girlfriend has ptsd as well and has seen some horrific stuff. This causes me to almost feel like I can’t go to her with what’s bothering me because I m worries of thrusting her into a bad place. 

We got into a big argument most of the day yesterday and I had several panic and anxiety attacks while this was occurring. I said hurtful things to her as well as she did to me. 

I tried to find the strength to go on to work this morning, But I simply could not. I spoke with someone on the crisis line who encouraged me go to the emergency room due to me feeling suicidal. 

I arrived her this morning and called to let my girlfriend know and she seemed to be upset about it. At one point even saying “we don’t deserve this” speaking about her and our 4 week old baby. 

I’m trying to get help that I desperately need so that I can make sound and clear decisions in my head.   

I just wish I didn’t feel so alone and hopeless. How can you feel like this as a new father?

bg5pgf,Worried I'll Never Get Better,"tw: drug overdose, eating problems

This is my first time posting here. I'm a woman in my late 20s &amp; I was just diagnosed with PTSD after a trauma earlier this year. I saved my roommate's life during a heroin overdose and I thought I had handled it well and was ""over it"" but as soon as she moved back into my apartment with me upon getting out of rehab, life has on and off been hell. I've been having nightmares or weird dreams every night (sometimes leading me to have panic attacks before I fully awaken), feeling such fatigue to the point that I'm always just waiting till I can nap, &amp; trouble eating to the extent that I will eat only a few hundred calories on some days. I have to take CBD oil or ativan in order to eat and even then, it's very hard and I have somatic symptoms like nausea. I was never much of a crier, but after an especially powerful acupuncture session, I have been crying daily at the drop of a hat (maybe a good thing overall). I'm about to start seeing a new therapist/therapy group, I'm going to acupuncture, and I contacted an EMDR therapist. I meditate at least twice daily. I feel like I'm doing all the right things to treat it, but I can't help but feel like I will never get back to any sort of normalcy. 

I overcame panic disorder and agoraphobia and was already working on treating an eating disorder (ARFID) and this traumatic event set me back in a huge way with all my previous mental illness diagnoses. After 5 years of struggling with these things, I moved to a new city and I finally felt like I had conquered it and could live a happy life. I had about 6 good months and then this trauma happened and it's left me feeling like I'll never get back to that good point. I started dating a new boyfriend around the same time this trauma happened (in fact, he was there when it happened, so he's experienced some of the distress from it) and I was feeling so happy and like I had found someone I could really see a future with and that I clicked so well with. But he has said he feels drained and exhausted by the relationship now that I'm doing badly, so it feels like only a matter of time until I lose him too. It's just heartbreaking that I saw a very real good life for myself and now it's being taken away by this response to trauma. I'm at a loss :(

bg7izt,Frustrating- long post ahead,"TW: abuse, self harm, s** assault,  su***de


It really really hurts like deep down inside my chest when I feel like my feelings are being brushed aside. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD, I’ve gone through diagnoses of severe clinical depression, moderate anxiety, insomnia etc. It wasn’t until I went to a new therapist that he looked at me and asked me “did you know you have ptsd ?” 

I partially struggle with this because I haven’t been through the worst things ever. 

I am the eldest of three children. when i was about 7 my aunt who was bipolar kidnapped me from my home and held me hostage for a few hours before my parents showed up and shortly after the cops. Nothing crazy but thats the earliest i can remember. 

My parents were constantly fighting, physically brawling in front of my brother and I but I was always in the middle of it. 

Then when I was 13 My father was diagnosed with a brain tumor (on his brain stem) and hasn’t had a job in over two years so my mother worked multiple jobs to pay for his treatments and I was left to take care of my brother who was 7 at the time. I suffered a lot of emotional and mental and physical abuse from my father. He was a very mean man. 

After my first suicide attempt following this i begged my mom to help me because I didn’t know what else to do. I was running a household by myself. (My parents hadn’t loved each other in a long time so whenever my mom did have a free moment she was out with her boyfriend or friends.) 

Once my mom was able to move my brother and I out of the apartment with nothing but a small backpack each with as much clothes as it could carry. Two weeks later my father abducted my brother from school and came to my school to do the same but my mother found out and tried to get the office to stop him. The school told her she had no rights and I had to watch my mom cry and try to get the office staff to understand our situation. I even talked to a guidance counselor about the abuse and they still made me leave with him. 

We got back to our trashed old apartment and he took a nap for the rest of the day and ignored us. 
The following day my father took us to Walmart with his mom and we happened to see my mom and her boyfriend there. We ran to her and cried that we didn’t wanna be with our dad that he wasn’t taking care of us. My mom quickly tried to leave with us and my grandma grabbed onto my arm and tried to yank me away from my mom. 
The cops were called and we were able to go home with my mom. 

My mom kept making us see our father and he was still abusive. I fell into cutting and other forms of self abuse and mutilation and abused my depression medication. I spent most of my time disassociating or not being able to leave my bed. I’ve been in and out of therapy and have tried almost every drug for depression and anxiety under the moon. I abused and hoarded the medication I took to sleep. 

Then my father died when I was 18 and all of my symptoms got worse. I was told by my stepdad that he died. And I was told three days after he had passed. My dads family hasn’t spoken to me in a long time. I don’t even know where he was buried so I don’t have any closure for that. 

I was sexually taken advantage of when I was twenty by a date I didn’t know. 

My mother kicked me out of my home because I stopped taking medication that was making me sick and because I refused to keep taking care of her new baby. 

So despite allllll of this. I still don’t feel like i deserve to be put in this category with people with genuine traumas.  

Does anyone else feel this way? I didn’t come out of all of this scot free. I have really bad panic attacks. Paralyzing depression. I recently got a service dog so I’m doing a lot better than before. I want my feelings and my experiences to be taken seriously but I feel when I say ptsd it dismisses me entirely.",Phoebsbby,2019-04-22 14:17:00,2,765,39.41,35.22,90.19,1,17.39,14.12,94.51,58.69,20.78,17.52,12.68,1.83,0.26,2.61,0.13,3.27,4.44,14.77,8.76,4.05,8.1,2.22,19.35,4.18,2.75,1.44,1.44,1.7,5.49,1.05,4.44,0.52,1.44,1.05,12.42,4.31,0.52,2.88,3.79,9.28,2.61,0.92,0.39,1.18,1.05,3.4,2.22,0.65,0.26,1.18,3.4,0.78,2.35,0.13,0,9.54,3.53,1.7,1.96,2.09,0.65,10.72,7.19,0.52,13.07,2.35,4.71,6.14,1.57,0.39,1.05,0.52,0,0.52,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,10.33,5.36,0.92,0.13,0,0.26,0,0.13,0.26,2.09,0.52,0.65

bg8tfx,Massage Appointment cancelled,"33F here. It’s been a rough go for a while. I’m plugging away with the help of a therapist and getting through a lot of childhood trauma - sexual, physical, and emotional. I was on anti-depressants, but weaned myself off around Thanksgiving. I’ve been using meditation, exercise, and other coping strategies to keep myself in a good place. I’ve thought for a while that I was doing pretty good! I’m staying busy and haven’t had any big issues. I have a really weird job situation where one job is desk-bound and the other is climbing and travel based. At Christmas I thought I would buy a massage experience through Groupon. I’ve had massages before and they are wonderful in more ways than just relaxing. 

The company is reputable, that’s not the issue. The problem that I talked myself out of worrying about is that the masseuse is male. I talked myself through my unfounded concern with my history of sexual assault. I drive to the location today, and it is a personal residence. Nope. Not going to happen. Never met the guy, not going into his home by myself. By the time I got home after my “drive-by”, I was shaking and crying. All I wanted was to reduce stress, soreness, etc. and I 100% talked myself out of it. 

I’m not sure if this makes sense. But I am sincerely struggling with the issue that I am incapable of trusting people. Especially those who have done nothing to harm me. I am now easily triggered and jump at every unexpected sound. I feel like I have regressed and my progress just went out the window. 

He texted me asking if I was coming in, my one saving grace was that I convinced myself not to lie and tell him I had a last minute trip out of town. I very briefly apologized, said I had a bad history with men and the fact that his company was run out of a private residence made me uncomfortable. I explained that I would not be pursuing a refund because I legitimately bailed last minute on a slot that could have been filled by someone else. He responded back with a brief apology and told me that it is a former “residence” and is now a house converted into office space for two companies.

bgajcq,Did you fight back or submit to your abusive parent?,"Did you fight back or submit to your abusive parent?

I hate that my brother submits to my abusive parents instead of fighting back. My brother and I handled the narcissistic abuse differently which is a big reason I was the scapegoat and he was a golden child. I fought back and stood up for myself and others and rejected my mom—which made me subjected to her horrific abuse. He became submissive, agreeable, and sided with her and became the flying monkey. Because he never practiced asserting himself and setting boundaries, my brother had a lot of relationships with abusive people where he never stood up for himself and sometimes I would have to stick up for him when others bullied him. I also had this issue but with me, I often would reach a breaking point sooner in the relationship and would blow up at the person and end the relationship (borderline traits).

I know we both suffered from abuse but I find his way of dealing with it to be infuriating. I know my brother was hurting, too, and was manipulated so I do think he saw me as the bad one for probably most of his life (I fought back at my mom and bullied my brother as a child as I was a hurting child hurting  others). However, as we got older, I realized my bro had incredible incite and I also know he knew I was being abused to a certain extent but Instead of helping, he ran away from the family and victim blamed and scapegoated me because it made his life easier as it was easier to see me as bad than his mom and dad.

Last year, we had a family therapy session and he acknowledged I was right about the sexual abuse my dad put me through. He tried supporting me for one year but then cowardly/passively decided he wanted to be neutral again and support my parents again. He said, “what happened to you is your story.. but mom and dad gave me a good childhood.” Sounds like he is in denial. The Last time I talked to him, he said “mom and dad did the best they could. And I don’t like it when you talk bad about them.”
I find it to be so cowardly and passive to not to stand up for what he believes in/what is right at the age of 28. And yes, also this behaviors shows how much the abuse had broken him down that he fears the consequences of going against the grain. Any incite any of you can provide so I can better understand by brother to forgive him?

Did you fight back or submit to your abusive parent?

Do you think one is more courageous than the other? And why?",journey1992,2019-04-22 18:55:58,9,482,30.18,79.66,42.83,1,20.08,16.39,94.19,60.37,21.37,17.63,8.51,0.62,2.28,5.81,0.41,3.73,5.19,13.07,7.47,6.02,10.79,0.83,15.56,4.15,3.53,2.07,0.83,1.45,8.92,2.7,6.22,0.21,3.94,1.04,18.88,4.77,0,1.45,7.68,12.66,3.53,1.87,1.04,2.28,0.62,4.15,1.87,0.62,0.62,0.62,0.83,0,0.62,0.21,0,11,4.15,0.83,4.98,0.83,0.83,8.3,5.81,0.62,10.58,1.04,5.6,5.19,0.41,0.41,0.41,0,0.21,0,0.41,0,0,0.21,0,0,10.37,3.94,2.7,0,0,1.24,0,0,0.83,0.41,0.83,0.41

bgf2gb,Please help me find ways to cope while I'm saving up to go back to therapy,"Hi everyone, 

I'd like to ask for help. I'm a 19 year old female. 

Growing up, my parents were emotionally/verbally abusive. My brother was physically violent to me. He would still have several angry outbursts today. My two aunts who stayed with us were also such angry people. I'm the youngest in the family. Most of the times, I never fight back since I never wanted to be as angry/violent as them. During the times that I opened up about how they treated me, they immediately dismissed it and called me selfish. 


Entering college, I only get to see my family once a week. I developed certain habits from the trauma I got from my household. Because of how they treated me, I often get anxious for standing up for myself.

My first kiss wasn't consensual. My close college friend kissed and groped me when I was drunk. Months passed, another close friend kissed me forcefully, but this time, no one was drunk. Then came the time I had a boyfriend. 

Things were going great at first, and he even helped me cope with the trauma I got from the two guys. Then, he began forcing me to show him my chest and lower private part. There were several times I said no, but I gave in eventually. I didn't see it as a red flag before until he forced me to suck him off. 

It was a terrible experience. I puked and cried right after. I didn't notice that he was manipulating me that time when he started going like ""Oh no, I'm such a douchebag for doing that! I'm sorry I'm a huge douchebag!"". I ended up comforting him that entire night instead of the other way around. It was our first relationship. We didn't break up that time. He was also controlling, and didn't give me privacy whenever he forced to see my messages. I was wrong to give the relationship another chance because after months passed, he sexually abused me several times. He would apologize, then do so again. I will not go into details with the other sexual things he did since this is all I could talk about without breaking down. We broke up in 2018.

I'm currently not seeing a therapist atm, but will do so again next month once I save up some money. I'm in my third year of university and I do freelance graphic illustration part-time so I don't really get as much. 

Can anyone recommend other ways for me to cope while I'm not in therapy? I've been getting nightmares and intrusive thoughts again. I'm mostly scared these days. All this trauma I got from different events makes me feel so weak. One of my harassers also contacted me. Idk what to do. I'm scared of not getting better.",throwawaygc00,2019-04-23 04:07:02,13,489,19.22,17.34,97.81,1,11.64,15.13,94.68,58.69,22.9,17.79,13.29,0.82,0,2.86,0.82,5.11,3.89,13.29,9.82,6.95,7.16,3.48,18.2,5.73,2.86,1.43,2.45,2.66,7.16,1.84,5.32,0.61,2.04,0.82,11.04,1.02,0.82,0.41,3.48,10.63,0.82,2.45,0.82,1.23,1.43,3.89,2.04,1.43,0.2,0.2,2.25,0.2,1.23,0.41,0.41,10.63,4.09,0.82,4.09,2.04,0.2,7.77,8.38,1.64,18.81,2.04,5.73,11.45,0.82,0.82,0.61,0.61,0,0,1.23,0.61,0.41,0,0.2,0.2,16.97,7.98,3.48,0,0,0.2,0.41,0.2,0.41,3.89,0,0.41

Honestly, if someone can find it in their heart to forgive their abuser, great for them. Maybe I’m jealous even. But how do they do it? How does forgiving someone who hurt you so much, and can hurt others help you heal? 

I think I forgive my parents for abusing me. Maybe. I feel like they really don’t know any better and just can’t feel empathy and they can’t help it. But the person who took advantage of me when I was a minor? The person who took me in after I was abused and took advantage of my poor state and gaslighted and abused me further ? Both of them can rot in hell. Vile human beings , who get to live their lives normally after they hurt me , and probably think of me as a stain on their reputation who might never go away..

bghhx7,How do you handle and cope with the paranoia and fear?,"When the possibility of something very very bad happening is absolutely real and something might happen just on the chance of one person's whim, how do you cope with the paranoia and fear? The endless anxiety? I am doing my best to block him on everything, but he still has private information about me that could allow him to find me again. He is such a sick delusional scary angry person, he's 110% capable of hurting me or worse, I know that completely for sure. He has in the past with others. He can do anything and says he knows I deserve every bit of it, as I am somehow the one at fault, so ""his conscience is clear."" But I know, I know, I did not do anything wrong. I am just extremely unfortunate to have met him and very stupid, naive, and gullible to have kept contact and beloved everything he said.

I cannot focus, my mind is filled up with nerves and unease. Fear is eating up everything. I try to busy myself, work and podcasts and music so my mind doesn't wander. I haven't felt this way since I was a child, during the abusive periods. Maybe even worse than that, I don't know.

bgi95u,Psychogenic Tremors -- Uncontrollable Shaking,"Does anyone also experience psychogenic tremors at seemingly random intervals? I've noticed that my husband has bouts of shaking. His head will jerk as though his neck is having spasms. Nothing else happens, just a head jerk.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been reading that these moments of shaking, if they are psychogenic tremors, can be a form of healing for the person afflicted by PTSD. It could be a way for the body to repair some of the damage due to his condition.

&amp;#x200B;

I pointed out this new trait to my husband who was a bit embarrassed. These tremors happen at any time, and he can't control them. They don't seem to affect his daily life or routine. I've noticed, too, when he is having these tremors, his triggers/flashbacks seem to be lessened.

bgicn6,"Anyone try to overcome your triggers and do an activity you feel irrationally scared of, but then something bad actually does happen?","I'm pretty messed up by this experience.  I developed an irrational fear of my husband's sister after my birth sister abused me. My birth family also abused me during a weekend when my husband was away SILs place. It took me awhile to understand what happened. I am far away from them, estranged, and safe now. My injuries healed and I reached out to SIL as part of my recovery and return to normal life. During my period of fear with SIL, I kept remembering bad stuff. My husband has always had a nice relationship with her and I thought it was my ptsd. We weren't close, but were friendly before.

I have had consistently bad experiences with her since reaching out. At first I thought it was my ptsd, but eventually I realized she's a rude, unhappy,  critical person. My husband would never say it outright, but he has mentioned some of this before.  We don't see her very often, so I had tried to assume the positive. Overall,  I think she has a bit of toxic jealousy now that my husband has suddenly became so academically successful and confident. I'm also the opposite of SILs husband, I get along with their family great and my husband and I have a very supportive relationship. She has said many times that she is jealous. Her life might be going the opposite direction since we met. 

I feel like I'm going to go nuts. It was so terrifying to reach out to her and she turned out to be kind of crappy. Not terrifying like my sister, but definitely kind of a jerky, passive aggressive person. Fucking shit! From here on out I am just going to be seriously careful and never rely on any other vibe than my own when deciding to make bonds, especially not my husband's. I am finally sure that he does not know his family or friends at all now that he's living sober for the first time. 

Have you ever experienced facing things that trigger you, only to have a bad experience that halfway confirms your fears???  It's awful!",tree_be_free,2019-04-23 09:22:01,0,374,25.4,44.69,84.16,1,14.38,18.72,93.58,59.63,21.66,16.31,9.89,0.8,1.34,3.74,0.53,5.35,3.48,13.64,9.89,7.22,6.68,1.87,18.18,5.88,1.87,0.8,0.53,1.6,9.89,2.94,6.68,2.14,2.67,0.27,13.1,3.74,0.53,3.48,3.21,14.44,3.21,1.34,0.27,3.48,2.67,4.01,2.41,0.27,0.53,0.53,2.14,0.53,1.6,0.27,0,11.23,5.88,2.14,0.8,1.6,1.6,5.35,11.23,1.6,13.9,1.34,4.28,8.29,0.53,1.07,0.8,0,0,0,0.8,0.8,0,0,0,0,14.44,5.88,4.28,0,0,1.07,0.53,0,0,2.67,0,0
bgiisx,Parents with PTSD what are your triggers/How do you cope,"Hey everyone I'm new here so thank you for reading.  I have PTSD, Dysthmic disorder and Borderline traits. But my primary issue is PTSD brought from childhood neglect/abuse. Ive had repeated trumatic events happen over the course of my entire life.
With that said I am also a parent. The thing is, what parenting involves often causes triggers for me. 
Example:if I am out and about with my kids and one of them begins throwing a fit I am triggered by their screaming which causes me to have flashbacks of my childhood when my baby sister would be screaming. Obviously in a public place with onlookers this is embarrassing. I shut down and have verbally been harrassed by strangers. They say things like ""cant you parent your kid better?"" ""Are fucking retarted?""
Doesnt help one of my kids has actual ADHD and another a processing sensory disorder so even if I didnt have PTSD these would still be issues that are difficult to control. 
At home if my kids scream like I said I'll flashback and be like in the same situation as a kid when I had to find food for my sister who was crying from being hungry. 
If my kids fight I am triggered because the fighting reminds me of me and my sister fighting over food.
Even though my children are safe and I provide a stable safe environment so I know their screaming is over not getting what they want and I know their fighting is over normal sibling rivalry I still am triggered the same way. 
I thought id be used to it by now but actually it just gets worse. I'm always in fight or flight. Always every day and the only peace I get is for the maybe 4 hours of sleep I get at night. 
I dont have support, no family or freinds at all and both parents dead. So its not like I have a support network that I can call for help with a break.

bgioaa,A PSA about Avoidance,"I feel like  people don’t talk about avoidance enough in regards to PTSD when it’s typically one of the most crippling symptoms when stemming from PTSD. As someone fortunate enough to be able to eek an existence out finically by living frugally coupled with my partial VA Disability compensation  I know I have it better than most. The few times I’ve tried to get a job to pay off old debt (or try to accomplish much of anything) I find myself barricaded in by my own avoidance. The thing I’ve noticed about avoidance is we adjust so much of our life around it that we don’t even notice we’re doing it up until you’re basically agoraphobic. Don’t go down a rabbit hole of “what am I avoiding” or “why am I avoiding it” outside of therapy/counseling. Just validate you and your symptoms, remind yourself that you’re not a lazy shit.

bgjhls,This is my story and I hope it helps those who struggle with people understanding them. [Trigger Warning],"**My name is Athena. I'm 25F. I was diagnosed with PTSD two years ago and anxiety with depressive episodes. I am healing.**   


The first time I ever felt bad about myself was when I got excited about a movie as a kid and my dad told me ""no one cares.""   


I experienced verbal abuse from him that led to self harm. He would always say he was ""joking."" One time at a lake when I was 5, my dad threw me in and laughed as I couldn't breathe in the water. My mom ran down and pulled me out while I cried my eyes out. He said it was supposed to be ""fun.""  


An F on a math test? My dad almost punched me in the face but held back when I was 12.   


Me walking in on him cheating on his girlfriend (after my parents divorced?) He threatened to light my drawings on fire.   


Every time I talked about an accomplishment, it was time to move onto him. He never gave me praise - but showed me off to his friends because of my intelligence.   


When I became an adult, I had a tendency to attract men similar to him. So much so, I was raped two years ago. I joined the same club as my mom - from when she would tell me later.   


I've had men demand to see my phone, cheat on me without using protection, slap me, follow me on the street, grope me, assume I want to fuck them because I'm bisexual, and assault me.   


**I am afraid of men. But I don't let it control me.**   


I am in therapy and my therapist is awesome. I think I'm making progress but recovery is NOT a straight line. Don't believe the motivational speeches that ""everything will go away."" It doesn't but therapy teaches you how to manage and not let it consume you.   


Currently, I've been a relationship for 2 years with a man who has been very supportive. He struggles - he has ADHD and depression along with being a former Fetanyl user. I've seen him not be able to get out of bed but I help him as he's helped in in a healthy manner.   


My best advice is fine those you can trust. From friends, colleagues, family - ANYONE. It's not easy in the slightest but sometimes you can't do it alone. But once it's out of you, it feels SO good. Asking even the question, *""I'm going through a lot right now, can I talk to you about it?""*   


There are state resources, insurance, Medicaid - there are options out there that DO help! Try different therapists, different techniques, etc. But you HAVE to keep fighting. Not everyone works the same way. Sometimes medication doesn't work for some. Sometimes it's the only thing that helps.   


But you have to keep fighting. But there are some who don't make it. It's a fact some people have to accept. But YOU are in control.  


I am always free to be contacted to help. I work in health insurance and try to educate people the best that I can.

PTSD/SAD over here and it’s super hard for me to make friends due to those. Today I took a huge step and I had wanted to share it with you all. 

Backstory- I have a wonderful Fiancé who has a great group of friends that love to hang out. I hang out too, but struggle so much with talking due to my SAD and end up being quiet or not going at times. 

One of his friend’s wives wanted to hang out with me more and get to know me and asked me to hang out more. 

Now, I have been working really hard with my therapist on how to socialize and develop friendships. It’s been very rough going through and rebuilding on how to make friends and be sociable, but I have some great news! 

Today I went to lunch with the friend’s wife!! This is a big step because I usually panic/get very anxious when I have to socialize (and I was nervous this morning) but it was great and I felt like I’m starting to slay this anxiety dragon and taking these steps I’m starting to take back my life from my trauma.

bgl4gw,NSFW I'm struggling hard right now. (Trigger Warning),"I work in a school district. A member of the community violently killed two young girls this past weekend, one of whom was enrolled in our 4k. We started our day with a meeting about the particulars of the incident and how we, as a staff, will approach students in the coming weeks. Later in the day, we had a meeting about trauma (this was already scheduled as an ongoing effort to train staff on trauma-informed practices).

This entire day is triggering the hell out of me. I'm jumpy, on edge, and I can't decide if I want to scream or sob. People at work know my background to varying degrees, so they have been awesome. I saw the counselor they had on site and made an appointment with a therapist for tomorrow. I don't want to spiral back into panic attacks and flashbacks, but I feel like I'm losing it right now.

bgnepc,Having trouble coping with anger/anxiety/thoughts,"I’ve been struggling with PTS for a few years due to my former work. Last year I was finally diagnosed when I decided to talk to a psychologist about it. I go to therapy every week and group counseling. I see my psychologist about 2x a month. I’m currently on Trazedone for insomnia and Ativan (lorazepam) for anxiety. The Ativan I try not to take too often because it’s highly addictive. 

I’m having issues lately with intrusive thoughts and anxiety. The thoughts come back and I sort of get into this deep hole where it’s hard to get out of. I feel violent rage for no reason at all. It’s having an affect on my life every day and it really has a negative affect when I’m out with my friends and the thoughts come in. I don’t really know how to describe how I feel when it happens, but it just feels *bad*, and there’s nothing I can do but just go about my day as best I can until my mind gets off it, but it never really goes away. 

I plan on bringing this up to my therapist and psych next time I see them. It just hasnt been this bad, ever. Are meds (besides Ativan) the next step for me?",sugargliding101,2019-04-23 16:38:28,3,221,28.36,5.68,99,1,14.73,14.48,94.12,60.18,17.65,11.76,11.31,0,0,0,0.45,5.88,4.07,16.29,9.5,10.41,8.6,3.17,18.55,4.07,1.36,2.71,0,2.26,4.98,0.45,4.52,1.81,1.36,0,2.26,0,0.45,0,0,15.38,4.98,2.71,0.45,1.36,2.71,3.62,2.71,0.9,0,1.81,2.71,0,2.71,0,0,6.79,0.9,1.81,1.36,2.26,1.36,2.26,16.29,0.45,19.91,3.17,6.79,10.41,2.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.84,5.88,1.81,0,0,0.45,0,0,0,4.07,1.81,1.81

Since the age of 4 after my traumatic event it caused me to find safety in my head and hide away from the real world. This behavior followed throughout my adulthood. I’m now 25 years old. I feel like I’m never completely present. But I’ve allowed myself to cope and practice grounding myself through meditation and other tools. I get little glimpses of feeing like an actual human being and seeing myself as an individual. Does that make sense? Feeling like an individual, as in realizing I am a whole person who’s walking around being myself. 

 I realize how many chances I’m missing by hiding myself. It’s just that I’m so afraid of other human beings. I’m paranoid.

bgpaxh,PTSD yet nothing to show for it along with rant.,"**Trigger warning** First of all I have PTSD and when I found out I had it I didn’t believe it and was disappointed in myself. I was bullied extensively, and I was almost driven to the point of suicide. I found out I had ptsd when I went to my old middle school and  had a panic attack. When I found out I had it I was ashamed because I felt like I could’ve prevented this standing up for myself, I have never been to war, seen a dead body, been in any really bad situation that I was in danger. So I feel like I’m too sensitive about my childhood and people have it in war based situations. I still have dreams nightmares about my childhood, I’m very cynical to teenagers and have a distrustful view of them, I don’t like to go near my old childhood neighborhood.  along with being bullied by my peers I was bullied by my dad about grades and I get horrified if I get anything less than a B. Even recently I was contemplating suicide(I had gotten a knife) because I failed my calculus exam after studying for 2 weeks( I didn’t eat for a whole 3 days almost and stayed in bed).  I feel like my ptsd isn’t validated because I only been bullied, threatened and betrayed. I didn’t have anything to show for it. 

Other times I get extremely violent and resentful. I don’t believe in revenge like that, but I don’t believe that people should be forgiven because I forgave a lot as a kid but no one reciprocated it. I do believe that people should move on to understand it, maybe make peace with it and forgive yourself. However you don’t have to forgive your abusers I feel like that’s a bit passive and removes the underlying valid feeling of being angry, because it’s okay to be protective, weary, and oblivious to the fact. I don’t see girls forgiving there sexual assaulter and having lunch with them.

I don’t have particular a revenge fantasy but I do want to see the people who caused my abuse to pay. From peers who contributed, teachers who ignored it, and even the one person who was responsible. For violence I want to fight them, I want to see them suffer. I would never do it to strangers obviously, or children.

bgpg3w,Am I going crazy?,"TW: Mention of molestation and abusive relationships.

Just as a preface: I’m currently a junior in high school, and the events I’m going to talk about happened during the summer before ninth grade and through out freshmen year (I don’t know the names for non-American equivalents, but I was 14 then and 16 now). Also, this is a throwaway account. 

In September of 2016, I was molested by my best friend. We had known each other since we were about 11 years old. It was extremely traumatic for me, and I was already in a physically and sexually abusive relationship with someone else in my grade- so the sexual assault basically pushed me over the edge.

I was depressed. I was traumatized. I didn’t leave my house for months, and my grades and social life suffered for it. Luckily, I’ve gotten a lot better. I’m going to therapy, I’m on medication, and I’m starting EMDT soon, which is said to help a lot. However, there’s still one thing I’m stuck on, and that is that I think I haven’t gotten over my friend who molested me. She truly did hurt me so much, and after we stopped talking she started dating my previous abusive ex (knowing how abusive he was because she was my best friend and I confided in her). 

I think about her nearly every day now, and it’s been nearly three years since the attack happened. Is this normal? Am I going crazy? She was my closest friend, and I haven’t been able to be as close with someone as much as I was with her, especially another girl. I don’t know.

bgr4f0,Nobody to talk to who will really understand,"I’ve got PTSD. Long story short, for a short period of time in my life (for maybe 4-5 months) law enforcement and other government agencies have been in and out of my house. From the cop knocks and seeing certain government employees call my phone on caller ID, those are triggers for me. I cut the wires from my doorbell because anytime someone would ring my doorbell it would literally scare me so back I’d stop whatever I’m doing, if I’m watching TV I turn volume down, try getting my dogs to be quiet etc. and I’d start shaking really bad, breathing hard. Sometimes it’s happen only to find out it was a friend that was coming over. 

What I want to vent about: nobody respects what I ask. I’ve asked my friends to text/call when they are pulling in my neighborhood. I said to them “I’ll have the door unlocked when you text/call when you’re pulling in” in reality I wait by my window to see their car. And then I let them knock on the door. But even though I know it’s my friend it still scares me. And I’m 18, my friends are 18 so sometimes they are obnoxious and knock on the door really quickly like they are playing a drum set. I’ve talked to one of my friends but he just didn’t understand. I explained the situation and what caused me to develop PTSD but he literally said to my face “you’re being a sensitive little b*txh, and cops didn’t harass you or over reach their authority blah blah blah” when literally every single government/law enforcement person did exactly that. But nobody understands that except my family, who I lived with at the time when cops/government was in my life for some time. But even my family doesn’t talk about it. My mom has anxiety when people knock on the door, I don’t know if she has PTSD but nobody in my family acknowledges or talks about what happened anymore. No one asks how I’m doing or holding up.

Even though these dreams are bad... The only good thing that comes out of them is being able to see someone from the past again that I havent seen in ages, looking exactly the same. one such dream was of my uncle that passed away in 2011, in a dream I was able to see him again and talk with him. The only thing different was that he had dreadlocks in the dream lol.

bgrnto,"I had just about a mental breakdown at the dog park when one of the dogs there was not being controlled by their owner and showing aggression, then went after, my SDiT and screamed at the owners. Panic attack strategies.","So, the snapping really effects me. My dog is my lifeline. Literally. He’s the reason I can walk outside and do small store runs and shit, go to the dog park. Oh, and go to school twice a week. Because I’m working on agoraphobia a lot. Fear and paranoia and depression keep me held in a tiny room for days to weeks at a time except one 90 minute class twice a week. I’m unemployed (of course I am). I have a lot of shit just not working in my favor, basically.

Anyways, I couldn’t calm down from the completely out of character screaming at these shitty ass dog owners who are just *waiting* to get sued, but whatever. Anyways, I tried breathing techniques but I was shaking. I ate and felt a little better for a little while. I relaxed in my car before class and I could feel the anxiety creeping up. The pain in my chest. The pain in my right arm. I’m thinking “Did I take my blood pressure medicine last night?”. I go to class and try to concentrate. At this point, I’m just exhaling super loudly. People are looking. Odin isn’t alerting. Why isn’t he alerting? How do I get him more in touch with the chemical reaction that’s going on right now? I’ll ask my trainer Thursday. So, I take my Xanax. I text my cousin I might be calling her soon because I was in class having a panic attack. I continue to try to concentrate. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely write and then I felt one big ass tear start in my eye. I waited until my professor had sat down after assigning class work and then I grabbed Odin and literally ran out of the room like a crazy person and sat down because it had started to feel like I couldn’t breathe and I was getting dizzy. I have fainted before. I call my cousin and I’m literally on my side on the ground outside my classroom spooning my dog and rubbing him. I was so embarrassed. 

Anyways, that was my day, sorry for rambling. The advice I’m asking is - what are techniques other than conscious breathing can I use to calm myself down? I sit and hold my knees to my chest and rock sometimes. I also have a nervous tick of smoothing my (nonexistent) hair on the side of my head. Sometimes they help. Sometimes they don’t. I need more options. I’ve tried aromatherapy, meditation, walking. Nada. I even use Dr. Bronners lavender liquid soap because it’s supposed to be calming and it sticks to the skin a really long time and my fucking deodorant is an anti-aluminum lavender scented paste (I’m basically just a huge stoner hippie). I am literally a lavender plant on legs. Even my blunts have lavender mixed in. 

Also, my doctor who prescribed me medical marijuana told me 10mg is fine, but I take .50 mg of 150 mg thc sublingually 2x daily and some flower or vape at night or when I need to relax. So, even thc with CBD in it couldn’t calm down my panic attack.

I don’t know. I’m just really desperate because I don’t want to look like the crazy person I am.",ohhoneyno_,2019-04-24 00:19:10,4,591,40.84,7.53,96.61,1.25,12.06,17.26,88.83,54.48,17.09,14.89,13.54,0,0,0.85,0.51,2.2,5.58,12.35,9.64,5.75,7.95,1.69,17.94,4.06,1.86,1.35,1.35,1.02,6.6,1.69,4.91,2.03,1.35,0.34,4.4,0.34,0,0.17,0.68,9.64,1.86,2.2,1.18,2.37,0.17,2.54,3.55,0.68,0.51,2.03,4.91,3.05,1.52,0.17,0.17,6.6,0.51,1.69,3.38,1.18,0.17,4.06,11.51,1.18,16.07,1.69,8.29,6.09,2.71,1.02,0.34,0.17,0.17,0,1.69,1.02,0,0,0.17,0.51,17.26,7.95,3.05,0,0,0.68,0,0.34,0.34,3.55,1.02,0.34

bguapf,Infantile PTSD and Autism,"Hello everyone,


I just had my first appointement with the local Asperger diagnosis center, the pedopsychiatrist (even though i'm an adult) straight away by looking at my medical record tell me she's sure i don't have asperger syndrome or anything Autism related, but that my problem is a development disorder due to infantile PTSD.


I'm puzzled by that, not only because she said that without me passing any extensive testing (just the usual boxes to tick to be admitted to the diagnosis center, and if she is sure why allowing me to come to get a further appointment for testing ?), but also because i objectively have a lot of the classic Asperger symptoms, fact confirmed by other psychiatrists.


I did have a very rough childhood but i'm well over it now, i have done long therapy work with different specialists and i have progressed alot, but i did no progress on the same symptoms the psychaiatrists told me to get tested for : Being around people exhaust me, i have dyspraxia, i'm too sensitive to my environment, i can't get anything done if it isn't part of a well planified routine,my IQ is above 130, i struggle to look people in the eyes, i spend 8hours a day on my passion, my autonomy is near zero, i'm a loner... etc etc.. i can see how my chronic anxiety, insecurity, and tendency to depression could be linked to a PTSD but the other things are a stretch to me...


I was wondering if maybe some other people here could have an helpful point of view or a similar experience to share. The country i live in (France) is notoriously bad at treating psychiatric problems, let alone Autism... I have red studies that linked heavily Autism and PTSD... I don't know, felt for a second that i finally found something that gave sense to how i function and something to build on, but i'm back in limbo... I don't want to be Autistic or whatever, i just want something an explanation that make sense, and to me the PTSD does not explain everything, maybe i'm wrong and the life of someone living with infantile PTSD and someone with Aperger simply are a lot alike ?",shnitzel_2,2019-04-24 05:58:30,17,376,37.17,8.34,84.65,11.87,34.18,22.61,86.7,59.04,18.09,11.97,11.17,0,0,0.8,0,6.12,7.18,11.97,11.17,5.85,7.18,2.39,18.35,3.72,1.33,1.06,1.06,1.6,4.79,1.86,2.93,0.8,0,0.8,5.59,0,0,0.8,0,18.35,3.72,1.86,2.39,5.85,1.33,5.85,3.19,1.6,0.27,0.53,3.72,0.27,3.19,0.27,0,4.79,0.8,0.8,1.33,0.8,1.06,3.46,13.3,0,9.57,0.53,6.91,2.39,1.6,0,0,0.27,0,0,0.53,0,0,0,0.53,0,17.82,5.32,6.65,0.27,0,0.53,0,0,0,3.46,1.6,0

bgvnfu,I hate being angry,"I hate it when I get angry at people because of my PTSD. I was doing really good for a long time but now I'm sliding backwards. For instance, my husband and I are very honest with each other. We prefer communicating in ways that are like ""hey it looks like you've gained a little weight and I know that makes you unhappy, how about we go to the gym together?"" Or he gives my tummy affectionate nicknames and likes to play with it. I used to be completely fine with all that. 

But now all I can think about is my gaslighting, abusive ex, who told me I could have anyone and anything I wanted, if I just lost ten pounds. 

And it's more than just the weight. Anytime he teases me or just doesn't devote time to me when I want it, I get angry. I don't want to be thin-skinned and needy. I want to be an equal partner again. I don't even have energy to tease him back anymore, I just sigh and go to bed early to avoid it.

bgwtfv,"Confused, has anyone had a flashback like this? *potential trigger warning*","I've been diagnosed with PTSD, though it definitely has always presented as c-ptsd... I don't have flashbacks in the traditional sense, just intense dissociation/depersonalization. It's all related to childhood trauma, alcoholic/abusive father. Much therapy and time has made my anxiety/dissociation almost nearly a thing of the past.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to present day, my boyfriend(39m) and I(28f) have been together for 2.5 yrs. It's the first relationship (of many failed) that isn't turbulent and abusive. I attribute this to all the therapy I've done and allowing myself to be with someone who doesn't hurt me, and I've also learned how not to be codependent. 

&amp;#x200B;

The weird thing I'm experiencing is that my current boyfriend, at times, reminds me of the man from my abusive (romantic) relationship. Something about the way he moves/talks at times is similar, even though they are (in personality) SO SO different. They don't even look alike. This feeling is so intense that I have called him by EX's name, to his face and in conversations. Sometimes when I will be thinking about something we need to do together, my ex is the image that pops up in my mind rather than my current boyfriend. It makes me feel like I'm losing my shit because I keep mixing it up. The relationship with the ex was 5 years ago, and I barely think about him. It's causing me a moderate amount of distress, because it just doesn't happen all that much. When it does happen though, I feel very very uncomfortable and can sometimes slip into a period of dissociation.

bgxr62,Reconciling your understanding of a person now w/ the abusive person they once were,"Wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. I’m a 23F, &amp; my older brother is 30. We’ve never been very close, but aside from a competitive jealousy over grades and music, I never actually disliked him. We’ve had a lot of good times together, from going to baseball games with our dad to our shared childhood love of Pokémon (lol), and he was a good sport when my younger siblings and I would harass him and his high school girlfriends. So, basically, we had a fairly normal sibling relationship. Nothing toxic, nothing weird.

...But he also sexually abused me when I was five during the summer before I started kindergarten. I want to say I recovered this repressed memory for the first time a few months ago, but that’s not exactly true. It’s always been in the back of my mind, and while most of it is fuzzy, there are a few things I remember clearly and have always remembered. It’s just that any time the thought threatened to come up, my brain would just push it away, if that makes sense. So it wasn’t until recently that I was able to confront the memory and consider its consequences. And there have been a lot: I’ve always hated touching of any kind, physical intimacy makes me feel gross and dissociative, and I’ve been dealing with OCD that primarily consists of sexual intrusive thoughts my entire life. 

So. I’ve recently been counting my losses, and I am deeply pissed off and heartbroken about how much of my life has been taken from me by a selfish, horny twelve-year-old. While I used to have no problem being around my brother, and was in fact happy to see him, now my throat closes up at the thought. When I was home for spring break last March, I walked into the kitchen and heard my dad talking on the phone to him, and I was so shaken that I had to go outside until I was sure the call was over. I think my anger is perfectly valid, but I’m having trouble with the cognitive dissonance: my perfectly nice brother, the one I grew up admiring and appreciating, has potentially ruined my ability to have a meaningful relationship. Because of him, I’m going to have to pay hundreds of dollars on therapy. I’ve already lost a lot of my graduate school experience to therapy and depressive episodes, time I could’ve spent working on my thesis. I’ve already spent most of my life feeling disgusted with myself because of intrusive thoughts I couldn’t control. I might never get married, which is something I’ve always wanted. I have a pretty good life, but all the bad things are his fault, and I am angry.

I just don’t know how to reconcile these two people, because they seem entirely unrelated. My brother has always been socially off; he’s gone to therapy recently for anger management, and he often overreacted emotionally to insignificant things. I sometimes wonder if he knew what he did to me was wrong - he’s exceptionally smart, so he must’ve, but at the same time, I just don’t know. I’ve noticed he’s always a bit more stilted with me than the rest of our siblings, so he must feel guilty, or just awkward at the very least. My mom thinks I should eventually confront him, because she feels certain he’ll apologize. He genuinely is a nice guy. I don’t want to hate him, but I do. 

I don’t know what exactly I’m asking here...I guess I’m curious if anyone has had similar experiences or what your take on this is.",the-secret-history,2019-04-24 10:55:22,17,623,20.31,34.99,80.52,4.54,20.1,19.1,96.47,58.11,19.58,15.57,10.59,0.96,0.32,3.37,0.32,4.01,5.14,11.24,12.84,6.1,8.35,2.09,21.19,4.98,2.25,1.44,1.28,2.57,8.19,3.05,5.14,0.8,2.09,0.8,10.43,1.77,0.32,0.32,4.49,17.98,5.14,1.77,2.25,4.33,4.01,2.73,2.41,0.16,0.64,0.96,2.89,0.64,1.61,0.48,0.16,9.31,3.85,1.77,1.93,1.28,1.28,7.87,11.08,0.96,13.32,1.61,4.01,7.54,1.61,0.64,0.32,0.64,0,0,0.48,0.16,0.32,0,0,0,18.14,5.78,6.1,0.32,0.32,0,0,0.48,0,4.65,0.32,0.16
bgy0jh,Anyone have elevated heart rate related to PTSD?,"I have my heart rate spike when I have to do things related to my PTSD. If so, how is it treated? PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE QUESTION IF YOU CAN, EVEN IF YOU DON’T READ THE REST!



Here is the long backstory you don’t have to read, since I really just want to know how other people have treated elevated heart rate related to PTSD:

I’m afraid I’m about to end up being treated for a heart condition I don’t have, as I only have heart rate spikes temporarily when my anxiety is triggered. It used to make me agoraphobic because I was so convinced I was going to have a heart attack and die &amp; really interrupted my ability to function &amp; would go months at a time without leaving my house at all. I worked through that and although I still get the racing heart when I have to do things that relate to the PTSD, I am able to tell myself that it’s temporary and will go away when the situation is over.  I used to take 6 msg of Xanax a day just to get out my front door and now I don’t need anything. 

Problem is that I also have ADHD which I do require medication for...I get goldfish brain to the point I had 3 car accidents in 3 weeks off medication. At my last visit the guy I saw had issues with my heart rate and told me to see my pcp &amp; get clearance to continue on the medication I was taking. I’ve been at this particular clinic for years and nobody ever had an issue with it so I started getting anxiety about it again. I went to the pcp, my blood pressure and heart rate were normal because I don’t correlate her or her office to anything that triggers me. But I couldn’t sleep at all last night and was a nervous wreck going to my appointment today because now I was not only triggered by having to focus on my mental health issues, I was stressed that the clearance letter wouldn’t be enough and he’d stop my medication. I track my heart rate with my watch and it was fine despite my anxiety all night and morning...until I started driving to my appointment. As expected it spiked &amp; as expected he stopped my medication.  I told him I could show him my heart rate history and show him I only spiked because of this appointment. Now he wants me to go back to my pcp again and get clearance again and come back in a month. But when I go to my pcp my heart rate &amp; blood pressure will be normal &amp; when I go to the clinic again, it will be elevated again so I don’t know what to do.  

On top of that, he told me with elevated heart rate like that my heart could stop, which seriously triggered the anxiety I had about that symptom. I sat in my car crying for an hour before I was able to get it together to drive home &amp; now I’m having those familiar racing thoughts about my anxiety actually killing me &amp; I’m scared to take my kids out. What if my heart stops while driving them? Or while we’re out and about and there is nobody to help them? Maybe they’d be better off because now I’m going to have untreated ADHD &amp; in one 20 minute appointment I now feel the weight of the PTSD on me after years of feeling it was under control. He made me fill out the depression questionnaire (I was previously treated for major depression with TMS &amp; am on Prozac still) and I answered honestly about thinking my family would be better off if I was dead nearly every day and I was going to tell him that I was feeling very guilty about the impact of my mental health on my family. But he never picked up or even looked at the form. I left truly believing my family would be better off without me because now everything is about to get much worse for me and therefore them. So I’m obsessing about dying suddenly but also thinking I should die for the sake of my family. 

This whole event just upset me so much it made me start thinking about the whole traumatic event again in detail.and how unfair it is that the person that caused all this did 6 years in prison but got to move on with his life. And here I am 20 years later feeling sentenced to life. I know I’m going to be right back to having flashbacks and panic attacks and seeing his face in every stranger. I really wish I could restart this day and never go to that appointment. 

All of this could be over if I could just not have situational heart rate spikes but he offered me no solutions to what I can do about that. I’m hoping someone here has had similar issues and how you handled it. It’s not related to the medication because I’ve had this for decades even unmedicated and I purposely didn’t take it the last 3 days out of fear of this exact thing happening. So even if I just didn’t take it anymore, I’m still going to have these spikes that he says could stop my heart.",FleaDG,2019-04-24 11:16:58,11,918,16.79,13.56,89.87,4.11,26.23,13.83,90.2,61.33,21.13,14.71,11.98,0.11,0.44,1.74,0.44,6.43,3.27,13.73,11.33,8.61,8.17,2.18,19.39,2.72,1.53,1.63,0.98,1.2,3.92,0.87,3.05,1.74,0.44,0.33,5.88,0.44,0.11,0.22,1.63,13.07,2.51,2.94,2.94,2.18,1.42,3.27,1.42,0.76,0.11,0.54,4.14,2.4,1.63,0,0.11,5.23,0.87,1.09,1.2,1.85,0.76,4.68,11.44,1.53,15.58,2.4,5.12,8.39,0.98,0.44,0.76,0,0,0.54,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,0,11.11,4.03,1.2,0.11,1.09,0.44,0.11,0,0,2.83,0.22,1.09

bh049x,I cannot find a therapist and I'm struggling,"(TW: sexual assault)
I've not been formally diagnosed with PTSD, but at the very least I'm having an acute stress reaction. 

Last week I realized I was sexually assaulted six months ago by my ex boyfriend. Since then, I have barely been functioning. I'm tense, jumpy, and constantly on the lookout for any sign of him. If I see a car that even vaguely looks like his, my heart starts pounding and I can't breathe. I remember very little of the assault, but I'm constantly bombarded by the few things I can remember. I'm also crying all the time and deeply depressed, and I've resorted to self-harm. I'm constantly irritable and downright angry, which is extremely uncharacteristic of me. I also have absolutely no focus, and this is the last week of classes and I'm struggling to complete even the most basic of assignments. I already had some PTSD symptoms after it happened (I had two panic attacks in the weeks following the assault, and I was hyper vigilant for any sign of him following our breakup), but now they've ramped up.

I've been trying to find a therapist, but it's been dismal. I stopped seeing my last therapist in January because we weren't getting along and she was too expensive. I thought I found a really good one, but she's out of network and I can't afford her services. I went to my university's counseling services, but because I was referred out of their program a year ago, they won't set me up with a regular therapist. They are trying to organize a referral for me, but literally they called today and their suggestion was to see my last therapist, the one I stopped seeing. I'm so angry and frustrated, I don't know why I even bother with therapy. At this point I don't want to talk to any therapists at all. 

I feel like I can't go on, but I don't know what to do. I don't want my parents to know what happened to me and I don't want to have to drop out literally during the last week of classes. I'm starting a new job next week and I want to be excited but im such a nervous wreck I'm scared that I'll blow it. I know I should just keep searching for a therapist, but honestly, I don't think I can handle waiting a week or even a few days. I don't know what to do and I'm so upset.",ObviousButterfly,2019-04-24 14:16:00,0,424,21.33,5.46,97.48,1,18.43,18.87,93.63,59.67,20.05,17.22,13.92,0.47,0,1.42,1.42,2.83,5.66,12.03,12.5,5.42,8.25,3.54,21.46,3.54,1.18,1.18,0.94,2.36,5.66,0.71,4.95,2.12,2.12,0.47,5.42,0.24,0.24,0.71,0.94,14.15,4.01,1.18,1.42,2.59,1.18,4.48,1.65,1.42,0,0.24,3.3,0.47,2.36,0.47,0,5.19,1.18,0.47,2.12,0.71,0.71,6.13,14.62,0.71,13.21,1.42,3.54,8.25,2.36,0,0,0.24,0,0,0.47,0,0,0.24,0,0,18.87,5.19,4.95,0.24,0,0,0,0.24,0,7.31,0.94,0

But I was an idiot, and I read a post/thread on here about sexual abuse. And now I'm really upset/anxious/triggered. I'm really having a hard time right now. I can't even open my legs or be around a man.

&amp;#x200B;

bh1i07,I think my therapy made me feel worse? (A.R.T therapy),"To clarify A.R.T stands for Accelerated Resolution Therapy. Apparently it is like EMDR therapy.

Anyway, my therapist has just gotten certified in this therapy and I am one of her first few handful of clients.

We decided to do a more recent trauma for the first session that led me to developing a bit of agoraphobia and constant anxiety. 

As soon as we started I felt my anxiety arise from a 3 to a 8. I hated rewatching the ""movie"" of my traumatic experience. It took a while to get thru the whole thing, but after it was over I was shaken up really bad and said a awkward goodbye to my therapist.

My boyfriend was waiting for me outside and I tried to hold it together but eventually I told him I felt likw jumping out my skin. We ate out then went to bed.

This morning I am in a complete bitch mode, sobbing my eyes out after going grocery shopping at Aldi's. He dropped me off at my house because he had to work but tried to calm me down as much as he could. I talk to some other friends and all of them said this may be a "" hangover"" from my first session.

bh1qbw,How do you get people to believe PTSD is real?,"I have a 10-year-old with PTSD because she was attacked by a fellow student.  I constantly get comments questioning whether her (rather severe) mental problems are due to the attack, and not do to other possible trauma.  I talk about her elevated heart rate, about her flashbacks, about her night terrors, about her sweat, and it doesn't seem to register.  They can't understand how she can still be suffering from an attack that occurred over a year ago by a 9 year-old.  I try to talk about ""being stuck"" and how she thinks about him every day, multiple times a day.   So then I talk about how in movies you can see Vietnam vets have flashbacks 20 years later to see how trauma can persist for a long time.  For younger people, they don't get the references.

bh2p15,"Need help with a possible ""credible threat"" from a depressed/wayward vet","Keeping identifying details vague:

I came to learn today that a person I know confided that if he learns that his son is not his he will ""do something stupid"" (he may be doing a paternity test soon to establish visitation rights). He went on to describe that he would kill everyone around him and then himself. When challenged about killing innocent people, he then said he'd kill a bunch of cops instead.

I know for a fact that this person is armed with at least two guns. I also know, however, that he is basically the definition of a shit-talking liar, but that's not really putting me off being worried. He has never been violent outside of boyhood fights. He's basically a fuck-up with depression and drinking and smoking pot piled on (not to mention an estranged ""baby-mama"" who took his kid).

My main problem is that, as far as I know, he has only made these statements to one person. So if I call to have him committed, I'm essentially putting a target on my family once he gets free.

He knows exactly where I live and the layout and security of my house because he's been here in the past.

Perhaps I need a more specific subreddit, but I'm looking to get this person actual help and/or notify authorities to surveil him without exposing my family. No one in his orbit had the money or time to devote to helping him directly (not to mention many burned bridges).

Any helpful pointers would be very appreciated.

He grabbed my arm and told me to tell him why I lied about when we could go home and just kept screaming I'm gonna break your fucking arm. I'm gonna break your arm if you don't stop lying.

Chaos, struggling to make sense of his current reality. He was trained for this, trained to react, trained to remain calm. 
But it's different here.
Different when the explosions are right next to him.
Different when he knows that if he comes out from hiding to fight, he will die. 
However, the courage outweighs the fear; so he tries to fight, to defend. 
Before he can react, the earth shakes and the world flashes bright. 
Thankfully, he’s already behind cover because when he opens his eyes he sees death. 
It takes its form in dark circles into the tree that he happened to be standing behind. 
He instantly knows that he is lucky, but he also knows that someone must of paid the price for it. 
He sees it in the blood around him, hears it in the ringing of his ears, feels it the heaviness of his heart. 
A soul is gone and he knows he will miss it always. 

Even years after the threat has pasted he still feels it, still dreams about it and at times becomes paralyzed by it. 

At the same time in the same world, a young girl suffers the same weight but in a different form. 
She wakes up every morning to go to work and comes home late every night. All she wants is peace and to live the simple life she has without interference. 
But in the shadows lurks a man, desperate to hear what little details she has about the prey he is stalking. 
She tries to pretend that everything is ok but all the while she knows he's there. She spends her days finding cover. Whether in sleep or in hiding, her job is to elude the enemy. 
On the rare occasion he finds her she feels like a trapped animal. She wants to kick and scream and make as much noise as possible; but she knows his power and influence and she knows that he can convince her closest ally that he is friendly and is only there to help her. 
She considers dragging a blade up her wrists many times but has sheathed the blade thinking about her mom. The one person she can't bear to let down but more importantly at this time, leave vulnerable. 
The weight of all the responsibilities she feels nearly drowns her everyday. 
She has paid a price; she sees it in her blood that she wants to spill, she hears it in the dismissal of others, and feels it in the breaking of her heart. 
A soul is broken and she knows she will try to bring it back always.

Even years after the threat has pasted she still feels it, still dreams about it and at times becomes paralyzed by it.

when I was younger, a relative and I had ""experimented"" a few times. I guess that's normal sometimes with siblings, but it's more than that. more than 70% of the time, I did not want to. I had been guilted into it, made to feel like that was the only way I could get appreciation from him, and had been forced into it a lot of the times. now I'm in my lower 20's, and that was almost 12-16 years ago, and I get nightmares about that shit. I had successfully blocked it out for a very long time, but I've had a very traumatic event happen recently and a lot of my past redacted memories are flooding back to me.

there's more, though. for some reason, in conjunction with the nightmares, I've had sexual thoughts about him with people. It's disgusting and it makes me extremely distressed that it happens to the point where suicidal thoughts happen. 

to relate that to something that might make more sense, I was also raped by a girl when I was around 15-16, and after that I was solely attracted to people who resembled her, and that appearance isn't even my type.

so that's basically it. my therapist told me that it could be a symptom of PTSD given that I've had nightmares about it without knowing what they meant for a while, and then after remembering anything I've had all of these different symptoms along with the thoughts and nightmares.",throwaway_8675309-69,2019-04-25 04:52:01,1,340,17.34,12.57,80.58,1.76,18.89,15.59,93.53,63.53,21.76,10.59,9.12,0,0,1.18,0.29,11.18,5.59,13.53,13.24,7.06,9.12,2.06,20.29,5.29,4.41,2.06,1.76,3.24,5.29,1.18,4.12,0.59,0.88,0.29,4.41,0.29,0,0.88,0.59,17.35,5,2.65,1.76,4.12,1.18,4.41,2.06,0.88,0,0.59,2.65,0.29,1.47,0.88,0,2.65,0.29,0.29,0.88,0.88,0.59,7.94,12.06,0.88,10.59,0,4.12,6.47,0.29,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0,17.65,4.71,5.59,0.29,0.29,0.29,0,0.59,0.59,5,0,0.29
bh7x8f,DAE experience phantom touching?,"Hey team, on mobile and all that so sorry for formatting.

I began exposure therapy a few months ago and as expected I’ve had a kickback of symptoms (so many emotions, anxiety, nightmares, flashbacks etc). 

It has also brought forward something I’ve not experienced for years (way before diagnosis). I was wondering if anyone else ever gets this type of hallucinations (Are they even hallucinations?) where you distinctly feel someone touching you but no one actually is. Recently I’ve been feeling hands sliding down my back and someone brushing their fingers across my backside amongst other pokes and prods.

Anyone else?

I’ll definitely mention it to my therapist but just wanted to check with you guys to see if this was common and whether I should be concerned considering this is one of my *at my worst* type symptoms.",strawberry-cup,2019-04-25 05:16:41,6,143,14.66,26.45,91.85,4.49,15.89,27.97,90.21,55.24,20.28,11.89,8.39,0,2.1,0,1.4,8.39,1.4,11.19,9.79,6.99,9.79,1.4,16.78,4.9,2.8,1.4,1.4,2.1,4.9,0.7,2.8,0.7,0,0.7,9.09,0,0.7,0,0.7,18.88,3.5,0,3.5,5.59,2.8,7.69,8.39,0.7,0,4.9,6.29,1.4,4.9,0,0,2.8,0.7,0.7,0.7,0.7,0.7,5.59,7.69,1.4,13.29,2.1,6.29,6.29,0.7,0.7,0,0,0,0,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,17.48,4.2,2.8,0,0,2.1,0,0,0,2.8,4.2,1.4

bh91c5,My husband doesn't know that I have PTSD. (VERY long post),"Next month my husband and I will be celebrating our 4th anniversary. It's time for me to open up about some things that I've been through, so I'm going to share my story here to prepare me to tell my husband, because that for some reason feels like it will be so much harder. 

It took me two years to finally tell my psychiatrist that I had been sexually and physically abused by my ex step brother for about 3 years. 

My mother left my abusive, alcoholic father when I was six years old. He would lock me in my bedroom sometimes for so long that I peed my pants. My mom tried to get us out of there more than once. Every time, however, he would cry and beg her to come back. He promised to quit drinking, but he never did.

One day, my mom picked me up from school and she told me that we were leaving and wouldn't be going back home. She had met a guy at the restaurant where she worked, and we met up with him at a McDonald's where he was waiting with a Uhaul with our belongings. 

There are a lot of details from that time that have faded. My memory kind of picks back up at the time where I started getting in trouble for little things, like spilling milk. My step father called me dumb, or said that I had no common sense. I got grounded a lot for things that I can't even remember now, but I do remember that by the time I was 8 or 9 he made a paddle with holes bored into it that spelled out my name. I either got that or the thick leather Harley belt with metal reinforced notches.

 I was never grounded for less than one month, and when it happened my mom would come in and take everything out of my room except clothes, sheets, and school stuff, and books. I had to eat my meals in the kitchen while my mom, my stepdad, and his kids sat in the living room watching TV and laughing. Only after everyone was finished eating and I did the dishes was I allowed to go to my room. My step father also liked to publicly shame me by taking me with them to go bowling or whatever, but I was not allowed to play- I had to sit and watch while my step brother laughed and made fun of me.

My bedroom by the way, was shared with my step brother. My step sister and I shared a bunk bed, there was a small divider wall and then his bed on the other side. They were only there every other weekend. My step brother held a lot of power over me, he could get anything he wanted from his father while he was visiting. If he wanted someone to play with, he could tell his father and I'd be allowed to do whatever it was that he wanted to do. Privately, I would be blackmailed by my step brother to go along with whatever he wanted, or else he would beat me up or get me grounded for longer. Any time I told on my step brother, I was accused of lying and my grounding would be extended. 

By the time I reached high school, I spent a minimum of 3 months grounded at a time. My mom and step father had screaming matches several times per day. My mom tried to defend me, but he would always threaten to kick us both out knowing that we had nowhere to go. 

It started with my step brother masturbating on his side of the room while I was on my side and he thought it was funny. I already knew it was pointless to tell, because nobody would believe me anyways. Then one day he ordered me to watch him, and when I refused he threatened to hit me. So I tried to watch without actually watching, to go somewhere else mentally until it was over. 

After that, he didn't come over for a while. Then one weekend he came back and I was so afraid to go into my own bedroom. I had no choice though. When he came into the bedroom this time, he made me perform oral sex on him. Another time he brought a friend over and made me give him oral sex. Then he brought a different friend over and made me let his friend have sex with me while my step brother watched, and that is how I lost my virginity at the age of 14. 

After that, my step brother came over a few more times before I turned 18. He didn't try anything else, and we didn't speak. Within a year after graduating from high school, my mom left my step brother and we finally moved out of that hell hole and didn't look back. 

I buried all of this as deep within me as possible. It was too painful to even think about, let alone talk about. All along though, it has been poisoning my mental, emotional, and physical health.

 I have narcolepsy, and my sleep doctor is also a psychiatrist. I have intermittent FMLA for days when my narcolepsy is really bad and I need to call off. Physical, mental, and emotional stress make my narcolepsy symptoms worse as does depression and anxiety. Missing work increases my stress, it's a bad feedback loop.

I only recently started taking an antidepressant which has helped significantly with my depression and panic attacks. A few weeks ago, I was finally able to tell my doctor what I had been through. Once I started it all came pouring out, and here I am facing my demons after 14+ years of hiding them. I thought that talking about it would make me feel better, because that's what I was told. I don't feel better though,  that's the problem. 

I'm constantly reliving it when I am alone, when I am asleep, or when I'm triggered. I feel full of hate and anger now towards my ex step brother and step father for what they put me through. I'm not functional, I had to quit college, I miss work all the time, I'm fatigued and burned out. My husband loves me so much, he's my best friend. Whether I tell him what I'm going through or not, it is affecting him. I need to tell him so that he can understand why I have panic attacks, night terrors, and depression.

bh9v1a,Can’t remember traumatic event?,"Can it still be PTSD even though you don’t remember your trauma? All I know is there are some places or times of year that can seriously fuck me up and where I feel extreme fear and/or experience derealization. I have the feeling that “something bad has happened”. I avoid places that give me that old feeling from the past. I also get feelings of darkness and extreme loneliness out of the blue when triggered. What the hell is this? 

I’ve always been very sensitive and I remember my childhood as pretty intense emotionally speaking. I often felt overwhelmed, out of place and scared. 
I do have a memory of something that happened when I was 8 that really impacted me (the next day after the event I started having derealization and was crying all the time) but I don’t even remember why ? I just remember feeling very, very scared. 

I’ve experienced it since I was like 7 or 8 and I’ve never found an explanation for this. I don’t want to feel like this anymore 😔 I’ve talked to therapists about this but they’ve never worked on it with me, I guess because I also suffer from GAD and they were treating my GAD at the time and not these feelings.

bhaucp,How do you know if you have PTSD? How were you diagnosed?,"Is it possible to have PTSD without having suffered one single traumatic event?
I experienced trauma when I was around 4 or 5, but blocked it out. I remember things happening as a result, but not the trauma itself, so in that sense it hasn't impacted me as much as you might expect it to.

On the other hand I have depression and anxiety, and it feels like certain common negative experiences have brought on a trauma-like response. 
For example: dated a guy in high school whose whole family was toxic/manipulative. I broke up when it finally hit me how bad it was, but it was really messy and they tried a lot of guilt/manipulation after that, saying horrible things to and about me. They isolated me from mutual acquaintances to the point where I had no friends and had so much anxiety about going out anywhere. I couldn't eat for about a month, and I constantly had nightmares about it. They called and texted to harass me to the point where I had to change my number and hearing the same ringtone in public made me sick and induced a sense of dread. I saw the guy once about a year afterward and it caused a panic attack, the only one I think I've ever had. Even to this day I still struggle around the same time of year this all happened, I still hate that ringtone, and once in a while I'll still have a bad dream about it. It's not as severe as it was immediately after the fact, but the effects are still there to some extent.

Even beyond that, I frequently have intrusive thoughts that take over for a second, reminding me of something stupid and idiotic I did that really shouldn't bother me, but it does. I'll physically tense and my expression will change and I'm pretty sure people around me have noticed at times. It just comes out of nowhere even if I'm having a good time with people. If I'm alone I usually have to say something out loud to myself to snap out of it and bring my focus to something else.
Most people I know have had a bad breakup, or done embarrassing stuff that still bugs them today, but they don't seem to have such a bad reaction to those things.

Others who have suffered from PTSD said what I experience sounds somewhat similar, but I don't want to label myself with PTSD at the risk of minimizing the severe trauma and PTSD symptoms others experience. I don't necessarily have a traumatic event to point to as the source. How did you know you had PTSD or how were you diagnosed?

bhawte,Is seeing things part of dissociation? DAE see 'faceless' people? (x-post /cptsd),"Hello all!

New here, new throwaway too. I was diagnosed with CPTSD in 2013, and since then my symptoms have remained the same. However, in the last 6 months or so I've begun seeing 'faceless' people-- as in, people who have heads and hair but their faces are featureless. It looks like they just have flat skin instead of having eyes, eyebrows, etc.

When I see them I don't feel fear, and sometimes I see them in passing but there have been a few times in which I've been in a store and seen the same faceless person walking around a few times.

DAE experience this, or something similar? I don't think my other diagnoses would be the cause of this (ye olde depression, bipolar, anxiety) because I've had those since I was much younger and those symptoms haven't changed on me either.

bhc1sn,I’m so angry. I can combust.,"I was living with a misdiagnosis for almost two year. I knew something wasn’t right, I knew being medicated the way I was wasn’t the answer, but I didn’t know it was optional. 

I came back to my life, and family almost a week ago. After I was “shocked” back to reality when my husband told me he’s been angry, and annoyed with me. I had no idea, and he’s felt this way for three years. 

Back then I started suffering from chronic migraines. Followed by being diagnosed as bipolar. Then living with that diagnosis as it was a way of life thrusted upon me. Over that time I was taking medication that dulled me emotionally and physically. I lost touch with activities, people, and things I once enjoyed. My life became small. 

This past February while on a family vacation I couldn’t  sleep, and a week after the vacation I still couldn’t sleep. Then the nightmares came. When I was home that week I wasn’t scheduled to work. I had a lack of sleep, and was off my routine for two fucking weeks. 

On week 3 I broke down in my therapist office. I said I can’t live like this I’m ready to check out. She encouraged me to go to ED. I called my husband, and told him I’m driving myself in. 

I was there for 18 days. The first week I had “daymares”, and was super OCD. 
I paced. I forgot about my present life. 
I lost touch. I lived in fear. 
Day 4 Drs decided I was not likely bipolar, but in fact suffering from anxiety/OCD &amp; ptsd. 

They wanted to test that by taking me off latuda. I complied. I was experiencing my days as a living hell. Day 7 they started Prozac. 
Day 8 increase Prozac dose. Day 9 increase Prozac dose. Day 10 add on Straterra Day 11 increase Staterra. 
I remembered I had a family that I loved.

The Drs told me the vacation changed me in a way that disrupted my OCD. Also that I needed to get help for my ptsd and anxiety/ocd. My routine was not going to save me. After 18 days in hospital I went into a 4 week out patient
Trauma program-Prolonged Exposer. 

At 4 weeks in Prolonged Exposer my husband was honest after I pulled it out of him. I was fucking scared. I didn’t know losing my family, and spouse was a possibility. 

I returned home and spoke with my husband about the transition I was trying to make. About this transformation and self acceptance I was approaching. 

Also about how we needed to have more open communication. I said I’m not quitting. I asked if he was planning on living separately. He said no. I just want more time. I’m changing and reshaping some of my fundamentals. This ptsd shit is fucking hard. 

I have a choice to make to retrain my brain, and come to terms with how life has impacted me. To then learn from all this, or to let the fear swallow me whole and leave me for dead.

I chose to have courage and to overcome.

bhdl8b,Staying safe when you live alone TW suicide,"TW suicide

&amp;#x200B;

First time posting here. I have CPTSD and some suicide history (3 attempts as a child, and near-constant suicidal thoughts that I didn't realize were abnormal until this year. I thought everyone was like this.) Since starting therapy this year and poking at these emotions with a stick, I've been having a harder time fighting back these thoughts. I've had my first ""brush"" with acting on it in a decade (not sure where the line is between an ""attempt"" and a ""thought."" I got halfway through the process of doing it, and then called a friend for help.) 

My therapist is always asking me if I have a plan, and it's like, no, I *plan* on NOT dying. But what scares me is that the three (four?) attempts I've had, I didn't have a plan either. I just didn't have a reason *not* to. 

For example, when I was a kid I'd have thoughts like ""You could just kill yourself with this object, your life is crap and you can't take it anymore anyway, why keep fighting?"" but I'd come up with, ""Well, your brother needs you to make dinner for him tonight. No one else is gonna do that. We'll kill ourselves another day when it's more convenient."" And then when the day came that I couldn't come up with a counter-argument, my brain was like ""yeah, you're right, you should."" and so I did (and fortunately failed due to being a child with limited knowledge of biology/anatomy. )

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid that at some point I'm going to have a ""You're ruining all your friends lives by your existence, just take the entire bottle"" thoughts with my sleeping meds and not have a reason to convince myself not to. I've read lots of places stuff like ""leave your medicine with a family member and only get one at a time"" or ""remove all knives and blades out of your access"" but its like... how do you do that when you live alone? I can't leave my sleeping pills with anyone. I have to have a knife in the house to cook with. And I can't just call someone to be at my house when it's ""bad"" because it's like...always bad. I never know when it's going to be dangerously bad. 

I'm gonna ask my therapist about it too, but I thought I would try to outsource some strategies any of you might have too? More ideas are better than less. Maybe like putting things in a really inconvenient location or behind a padlock, so by the time you've opened it, you've calmed down a bit?

Trigger warning

A little back story: I had a crappy childhood with a lot of crappy family members.  My grandfather has been accused of abusing the little girls in our family.  I was told that around 3 he used to make me sleep naked in his bed with him and when returning back home to my mom I used to scream “don’t touch me” and things of that nature in my sleep. My grandmother told me she’s 95% sure I was sexually abused by him. I just want to know if/what happened to my body and I hate that I don’t know.  I’ve been raped, molested, and witnessed a suicide, so how much worse can this one thing make me?  Do you think the power of knowing where I’ve been is worth the potential added damage?

bhf0tn,Hidden Memories,"As many people on here I had a traumatic childhood. My Dad was physically abusive and a drug addict- My mom has severe mental health issues and a degenerative brain disorder, which made her also not the best Mom. My life really started to go downhill maybe when I was seven or eight? Before that it was fairly normal. 

I have worked through all the other stuff but there are some things I have trouble with. I would say I was very hyper sexual as a child. I originally thought it was just a weird thing some kids do and that I had no real reason for it. (I am fine now but I feel badly for showing my friends porn at s young age as well as showing my younger siblings). 

Anyways, so I have always had this obscure memory almost like a weird dream of my Mom finding someones pants at the end of my bed. They were really big black jeans, too big to be my Dad's. And there was a hole in the crotch as well. 
This memory has been with me for probably about 20 years. But I could never really remember if it was a dream or not. My Mom was really upset about finding the jeans. (In my memory/dream there was no reason for them to be there) My Mom wanted to or did call the police.

Now into my adulthood I have salvaged the relationship with my Dad. We were talking about the past and stuff and I don't remember how we got on it but he brought up someone, a Male coworker of his, who lived with us when I was 7/8. I have NO memory of this ever happening or ever having anyone other than my Mom and Dad being the adults in the home at that time. He dropped it really quickly when I questioned him about it as well. And didn't tell me the persons name either. He just brushed it off. 

Could something have happened and I be repressing it? Could that be why I was so interested in sex at such a young age? 

;;; I have since then been sexually harassed by many of my Mom's exes and also possibly raped but that I was older and don't have a memory of because I was drunk. (I woke up to her then boyfriend crying after getting his daughter and zi drunk when we were 12, saying he had a horrible dream he did something terrible to us). 


So idk. I know I should probably discuss this in therapy and I have done therapy before but never talked about these specific abuses then.

I feel fine about it really for myself. I mostly just feel badly for letting that poison effect other people at such s young age so well.",pickingpearswitchu,2019-04-25 15:49:11,0,477,11.54,30.74,85.94,5.57,15.9,12.37,96.02,65.62,20.75,13.42,9.85,1.05,0,2.1,0.42,7.34,4.82,12.16,11.11,11.11,9.43,2.31,16.56,6.29,3.14,1.68,1.26,1.26,5.24,1.68,3.56,0.63,1.05,0.21,11.32,2.73,0.42,2.1,2.94,16.14,3.98,1.68,1.47,4.4,1.47,5.24,2.1,0.84,0.42,0.84,3.77,0.42,1.89,1.05,0.42,4.82,1.89,0.42,2.1,0.63,0.21,8.39,6.08,0.63,11.95,0.63,4.19,7.34,0.63,1.26,0.42,0,0,0,1.26,0,0.21,0,0.84,0.42,10.9,5.45,1.26,0,0.63,0.63,0,0.21,0,1.05,1.26,0.42

I'm the type of guy that needs sexual contact in a relationship as well as physical touching, cuddling, etc. I told her this when we first started dating, very early on and she didn't say anything. This made me think that she was fine with this. However, for obvious reasons my gf isn't into sex with me very often. She doesn't know why, other than problems in the past as well as, the first and only time we had sex I came in her, assuming she was on birth control as she didn't say anything about a condom or anything like that. I realized I messed up there and have told her sorry and I was wrong for that multiple times. It's been about a month since then.

 I told her tonight that I needed sex to be fulfilled in a relationship and she said she could make herself but I told her I don't want her to do that.  I don't want to break up with her either but from her pov this is the only logical solution. She refuses to seek counseling or try medication due to bad experiences with both in the past. It just brings it all back up and it caused an attempt on her life where she hasn't been like that ever before.

bhgn2l,Am I crazy or do other people experience this? (TW: Sexual assault),"Two weeks ago I realized that I was sexually assaulted by my ex.

The counselor I've been seeing said that I'm experiencing an acute stress response (I've been having these symptoms to a lesser degree since the assault occurred around six months ago, but I didn't realize it for what it was until recently).

Sometimes I'll have a memory of the assault and it's like my body gets really heavy, particularly my limbs, and I start hurting. I really don't know how to describe it, but it's a physical sensation and it's really scary. It's often accompanied by this fear that I'm losing control of my body.

bhgr2y,CW: sexual assault. I feel like a worthless piece of crap.,"I was sexually assaulted 11 years ago when I was 16 and had a coercive, manipulative sexual relationship with a 25 year old a year later, when I was 17. I was slut shamed by my best friend, and eventually dumped by her. She also spread rumors about me. I lied to almost everyone about these events and couldn’t keep track of my own lies. I didn’t see a therapist or tell anyone the whole truth until 5-6 years later, junior year of college. 

10 years later, I have a great career in a creative field, I’m financially set for life thanks to family money (and loving supportive parents who don’t know about the assaults), I have wonderful friends, I just ended a 2 year relationship, my first long term one, super amicably. He taught me I can be loved in a real way. 

But I’m going back to my bad old habits- hypersexuality, just sleeping with people for attention and distraction when I don’t even want to, and attaching rapidly and obsessively to emotionally unavailable men that resemble the relationship I had when I was 17. The guy I was sleeping with fucked me and left me after 20 minutes one night because he had work early in the morning and I pretended like it didn’t bother me but it re traumatized me and made me feel abandoned, disposable, a wanton slut just begging for sex from some guy, the way I was made to feel when I was 17. He’s also a survivor and I know he has his own issues with boundaries, so I don’t totally blame him. I’m not a religious person, but I pray for him at night, I hope for him that he doesn’t feel the pain I do. 

I’m from another country and a big reason why I stayed in the US after college was that my assaults happened at home and I started associating home with those memories. So I also feel the loss of my home, and being so far away from family. 

I used to not be able to remember my rapists’ names, and now I do again, along with many other vivid details. 

I’m spending 4-5 hours or more on my phone every day to numb out on the internet or look at my crush’s photos or browse thru Reddit. I’m in therapy, I have a life coach, I exercise, journal, meditate, make art, see friends, I do all the right things. 

But I’m still so irreparably broken inside and I’m afraid I’ll always feel this way. All I want is to turn back time and tell my 16, 17 year old self to go home early those nights - tap shoes 3 times like Dorothy and you’re home. I want to feel hope that someday I won’t feel so ruined by something that happened so long ago, that doesn’t even feel “that bad” compared to what other people have gone through, but after 10 years my hope is waning.

bhhy5c,A different kind of flashback?,"I know I have PTSD. But my emotions that come with having PTSD feel invalid because I don't have visual flashbacks. It really makes me feel awful, like I'm fake or like I don't really have PTSD. 

Is it possible to have flashbacks that are not based on vision, but instead based on smell, taste, and even emotions? If so, I definitely have those. 

The taste of salt is one of my triggers (it's odd, I know). Even the sight of a salt shaker is enough to send me over the edge. It makes me feel like I'm dying. The smell and taste of blood and vomit is a HUGE trigger for me. Luckily, I haven't thrown up since the event that gave me PTSD, but I know that if I do, I'll have a full on anxiety attack.

bhiu72,I applied for a PTSD dog and got declined. And surprisingly through it I’ve learnt some massive things about getting better I want to share with you.,"Feeling incredibly frustrated and disappointed. This is the third time I have tried applying for a service dog and I’ve been declined again.

I have seen how helpful PTSD dogs have been for other people and was really hoping that this time I would qualify. 

Made a video about applying and getting rejected. Was hoping it would be a celebration video instead but it was a good way to process how I’m feeling. Something I struggle to do with PTSD. I actually learnt a lot through this disappointment and wanted to share that growth with you.

https://youtu.be/CUdXQuRrJGY

Two things I learnt are:

1. That if I try to numb painful emotions I lose access to the positive emotions too. It’s important to allow myself to feel the disappointment and frustration.

2. That it’s important to share when things don’t turn out how we hoped. It helps us to stay connected to others.

bhlwp0,I want to inflict self-harm to ease mental pain and tension,"Hey guys! I'm diagnosed with BPD-ADHD-PTSD (I'm only humaaaan after aaaall). Today I am having horrific menstrual cramps, and what I've discovered is that - menstrual fatigue and stomach cramps relax my mental tension, just by changing my focus on physical pain. There's a House MD scene where he needs to relieve his leg pain immediately and takes a knife/nail or something and sticks it into his arm. For a few times me and my ex bf have willingly tried whips and it literally made me the calmest, happiest, person. So I'm thinking doing something similar to ease my tension and get those happy hormones flowing. But I don't want to aesthetically ruin my skin, I wanna work in public service, so  I need a less 'dirty' method. Less blood, just some regular type of pain a gurl can inflict on herself without looking ugly in public. 

Any suggestions? Any methods?

bhnkak,Cops gave me PTSD?,"I was driving around my hometown and wound up getting pulled over for a broken turn signal. Now, yes I was doing something illegal aside from that, I did smoke cannabis in my car a few hours prior but I was not driving while under the influence of it, my car is just my smoke spot. He pulled me over, came to my window and began asking me for my ID and insurance. I was trying to be as nice and cooperative as possible using my customer service voice. He then asked me to step out of the car and began asking me where the weed was. I told him that I didn’t have any in the car so he searched it while his partner kept an eye on me on the curb, I asked if I could get my jacket out of the car since it was chilly out and I was trembling from anxiety and the cold. He said yeah and that he would find it, he had a really hard time finding it so I took a step towards my car to try pointing out where it was and he turned around and snapped at me yelling to stay right there and he had his hand on his holster. That actually shook me a lot, I’ve never been yelled at by a cop. After he found it the one searching my car found a bottle of my friends antidepressants she left in my car the night prior. He then began interrogating me about it and when I tried to explain that they were my friends he didn’t believe me and was just overall talking to me like I had just been caught with a pound of coke. Even though my friends name was in the bottle and I told him he could drug test me he told me it was a felony and threatened to take me to jail, but wound up writing me an extremely hefty ticket for cannabis (apparently he found shake on my floor) and my broken headlight. This terrified me because of how mean they were and how threatening they were. This was my first time getting in trouble with the law since becoming a legal adult so I thought my life was over. I know I did do something wrong but I wouldn’t hate cops now had they been less aggressive. I had a similar experience months prior only that cop was the total opposite and even though I still got in trouble that time the cops attitude left me feeling more respect towards law enforcement however after this last experience I never wanna talk to one again. Anytime I see a cop on the road, even if I’m not doing anything illegal my heart races, I start hyperventilating and my stomach ties knots. I didn’t think it was that bad until just a few days ago I saw someone with LED lights in their car that kinda looked blue which clashed with a red light behind me making it look like cop lights for a split second. I actually panicked and there wasn’t even a cop.

bhoh7i,"(TW: Sexual Assault, Emotional Abuse, NSFW) is it normal that I'm not always mad at my abuser?","So, in November of last year, I was sexually assaulted by my ex. I didn't recognize it as sexual assault at the time but I KNEW something was wrong. I remember very little and it was very much a grey area in terms of consent, but I do remember crying afterwards, as well as having two panic attacks (both triggered by him) in the weeks following, and then displaying mild PTSD signs once we broke up.

I kind of forgot about the incident for a while, but then it came back when I was watching a documentary where a woman was describing being raped by her husband. Even then though, I still brushed it off.

It was only two weeks ago when I told a friend of mine and she told me that what he did was sexual assault. Since then, I've been a mess. I'm jumpy, hypervigilant, depressed, and everything that reminds me of him makes my heart start pounding. Sometimes I have a memory of the assault (I get a lot of intrusive memories) and then I feel this strange heaviness/numbness, almost like my whole body is locking up. Other times, I feel like my throat is closing up. I've had days where I'm extremely angry and one night I did something very stupid and called him. I told him what he did, and he lied and said he had no idea he was hurting me and that he doesn't even remember the incident. He did apologize but he still managed to make it about him and how he felt.

The thing is like.... sometimes I don't know how to feel about him? I mean I'm terrified of him and I don't ever want to see him again, but like sometimes there are days where I can't bring myself to be mad at him. The last three days, for example, I can't even bring myself to fully understand that what he did was assault. I can't even be mad. Even when I think about the assault and all the emotional abuse that led up to it, it's like I feel nothing at all. The actual memory feels foggy and distant, and I have almost no emotional reaction. I don't understand. 

Even now, while thinking of the assault brings up a fear response, it still feels crazy to call it assault. But I also know how it made me feel. I know how scared and hurt I was, and I know how deeply coming to this realization has affected. But despite all that, I can't feel anything about it. 

I guess part of it is that I was in a relationship with this guy for two years, and the emotional abuse really only started in last six months or so of our relationship. I was emotionally abusive to him too, but I apologized to him, and it was nowhere near the level that he got to with me. I also just like always thought of him as a good guy and I thought he would never do anything like that to me, even though I now see plenty of red flags prior. 

This is probably a stupid question, but is what I'm experiencing normal? I keep being scared that this lack of feeling means that there's something wrong with me or that it was my fault.",ObviousButterfly,2019-04-26 09:44:09,10,574,10.29,19.19,92.44,1,18.52,14.29,96.69,64.46,23.52,15.51,10.63,0.35,0,4.53,0,8.01,4.36,11.85,9.58,9.41,9.76,2.61,19.69,4.01,1.92,2.61,1.22,1.57,8.01,0.35,7.67,0.87,4.01,0.87,8.01,0.17,0.52,0.52,4.7,16.9,5.75,2.44,0.52,2.96,1.92,3.83,3.66,1.05,0.17,2.26,1.57,0.52,0.17,0.87,0,5.4,1.05,0,3.14,0.52,0.7,7.84,11.15,1.05,14.46,1.39,4.88,8.36,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0.52,0,0.17,0,0.17,0,15.68,5.4,5.23,0.17,0,0.52,0,0,0,3.14,1.05,0.17

bhqdti,flashbacks during sex (cw sexual assault),"hi everyone, 

  
I'm 25. I was raped by two strangers about two and a half years ago. I'm in therapy, did EMDR, and haven't had any dreams or flashbacks for over a year. Everything was going really well, until last night, when I had a pretty intense flashback to the rape during sex with my partner.  I've been with my partner for about six months, and everything about him is wonderful. We have great sexual chemistry, and I feel so loved, respected, and safe in that aspect and in other aspects of my life.

Let’s see you goddamn “””””move on””””” after making your first real connection in a decade and then having them ghost you over (more likely than not) their own abandonment issues. It hurts goddammit. Not even cuddling my therapy dog or seeing my therapist is helping the pain much anymore. I just want to finish remodeling my room so I can get blazed again.

bhvxhi,My supervisor triggers my PTSD and I apparently trigger hers *some potential verbal/emotional triggers; mentions of drug use and marital abuse*,"tl;dr: my supervisor is loud, extroverted, and impulsive. she has ptsd that causes her to lash out. i have ptsd that is triggered by people who are loud, extroverted, impulsive, and who lash out. help please?

I work in an office that, among other things, advocates for adults with disabilities. Many of the staff also have accessibility needs as well, so the workplace environment is one the recognizes and appreciates employees who are abled differently. I have worked there for 7 years. My immediate supervisor has worked here for a little over a year. 

I am female and in my mid twenties. I am very introverted and non reactive, very private, and — so I’m told — tend to come off as very serious and reserved. I have depression, social anxiety, and C-PTSD, the latter of which stems from my verbally and emotionally abusive father. Some of my biggest triggers concern his frequent and violent rages. Screaming, yelling, berating, etc. Both my direct supervisor and our boss are aware of my diagnoses and their roots. Both have expressed support.

My supervisor is female and in her mid thirties. She is divorced with elementary school aged children. She is extremely extroverted, often very reactive, very assertive, and very informal in her written and verbal communication. She has a temper and has made references to “losing” her temper and yelling at her children and ex-husband. She has PTSD stemming from a verbally and physically abusive marriage and a tumultuous childhood where both parents were drug users. She has been open with the entire office about her PTSD and some of the physiological symptoms she experiences, but has not shared many root causes. 

So here’s the deal: Her personality and impulsive, loud behavior trigger me in that they remind me of my father. Just like I never knew when he was going to snap, I feel as if my supervisor could boil over at any minute. I’ve seen some glimpses of it and it makes me nervous. Like my father, she is, in general, an unpredictable and impulsive person. I feel extremely anxious around her. While she often compliments my intelligence and my job performance, she has told me that I can come across as “intimidating” in my verbal and written communication. 

Recently, I came to my supervisor with a concern about another employee who habitually violates others’ personal space and often overshares extremely personal information. This behavior has been an issue for over six months. My supervisor wanted me to handle the issue in a way that I was uncomfortable with and I expressed frustration that, despite having been “talked to,” my coworker continues to invade my space and that of others’. Apparently, my supervisor felt like I was questioning her handling of the situation and snapped at me — she did not yell but she was harsh and preceded her statement with “I’m not going to be very nice right now.” I was immediately triggered — I teared up and froze up and had an extremely difficult time speaking. 

This week, my supervisor and I discussed that conversation and she stated that her PTSD was triggered by what she perceived as my questioning behavior. She repeated one phrase in particular and stated that it was what “set her off.” It was an innocuous phrase and completely inoffensive, except, I know for a fact I never said that. I am soft spoken and sometimes I mumble, so it is very possible that she legitimately heard something I didn’t say. Regardless, that phrase apparently caused her to lash out which then caused me to freeze up and panic. 

At this point, I don’t know what to do. I feel more afraid of her than ever and I also feel very much that she simply doesn’t like me, though she claims she does. My immediate instinct is to do exactly what I did with my father, which is become so easy and perfectly behaved that I become invisible. I am troubled by the fact that her PTSD apparently causes her to lash outward because lashing out is kind of the thing that terrifies me the most. I don’t know what to do other than quit, which I really cannot do right now for various financial and personal reasons. I would welcome any advice.",greydiente,2019-04-26 22:24:40,2,739,22.2,44.63,43.55,4.17,16.8,22.19,89.85,58.05,21.24,14.88,9.34,0.14,0,5.14,0.27,6.36,3.38,11.64,9.07,6.36,8.66,1.35,15.02,4.19,2.17,2.03,0.81,2.3,5.82,1.62,3.79,0.95,1.76,0.27,11.77,1.08,0,5.14,0.95,13.4,2.98,2.98,0.81,2.98,1.76,2.57,3.25,0.14,1.62,1.22,1.22,0,0.81,0,0.27,6.77,1.62,0.95,3.65,0.27,0.68,4.47,9.74,0.54,11.1,1.08,6.22,3.79,3.65,0.27,0,0.14,0,0,0.27,0,0,0,0.14,0,15.16,5.68,5.28,0.27,0.27,0.14,0,0.27,1.35,1.49,0,0.41

bi0o7i,I wish I had good prom memories,"TW: sexual assault 

This is just one thing that I’m not sure how to get over. I was sexually assaulted on my prom night last year and I have ptsd from it. It’s an uphill battle and I’m recovering slowly through therapy and self care, but sometimes it just upsets me so much that it was my prom. I was so excited, I bought a dress months before and took weeks making it into my perfect prom dress, I felt so beautiful and happy and now I’ve deleted all of my prom photos because it was the worst day of my life. My dad put so much effort into making sure it was perfect too, we don’t have a lot of money and we splurged quite a bit (under £500, but still a massive amount for me) and it just hurts that someone i was once close friends with felt the need to rip that away from me. The assault was targeting and I was threatened with violence so it wasn’t even a grey area. It hurts that there was nothing I could do to stop it or to justify his actions.

bi0qk7,Auditory Hallucinations?,"I don't usually do this sort of thing/ask people for help, but I'm kind of desperate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was recently diagnosed with PTSD after a flood destroyed a lot of my things and from people placing blame for the event on me (because I didn't unpack my belongings so that's why they were on the floor and ended up water-damaged) While images of water damage and floods are tough, I've gotten to a point with the help of therapy that I can handle them. But my biggest trigger is fire alarms, since the building alarm went off when the event happened.

&amp;#x200B;

I was starting to get better with fire alarm sounds where the panic attacks were manageable and I could keep from crying if there were other people around. Until last night... the fire alarms went off down the hall (not even in my unit) and I just panicked and burst into tears just like I used to before. Well... even after they shut off, I can still hear them. It's like there's this echo of them playing in my head. It's getting bad enough that trucks backing up and certain bird calls sound like them and make me panic and shake and shut down. I can't see my therapist again for almost a month and I don't know what to do. They don't go away. I've been listening to music and it helps, but I can't listen to music all the time when I'm at work/have stuff to do... but the echoing of them in my head makes me so anxious I shake and feel nauseous. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and can help/tell me what to do? It doesn't help that my family aren't able to be supportive right now because they're dealing with something else.",JadeyKayk,2019-04-27 09:23:54,5,314,33.1,19.5,94.45,1,18.47,11.78,92.99,60.83,17.83,12.1,9.55,0,0,0,2.55,5.73,4.78,15.29,11.46,6.05,8.92,2.87,19.43,3.82,3.18,1.91,0,0.64,8.28,1.91,6.05,3.5,0.96,0.64,8.28,0.32,0,0,0,11.46,1.27,2.55,0.96,3.18,0.64,4.46,4.78,0.64,2.23,1.27,2.87,0.64,1.59,0,0.64,8.28,2.23,0.96,3.82,1.27,1.59,4.78,13.69,0,16.24,1.59,7.96,6.69,0.64,1.27,0.32,0,0,0,0.32,0,0,0,0.32,0,20.7,6.69,1.59,0,1.91,0.64,0,0.32,0,5.41,1.27,2.87

bi3xl9,How do I stop feeling so bitter/petty? (Long),"Sorry if this is long/if the formatting is of/if this isn’t the right sub for this 

I have ptsd from years and years of verbal abuse from my dad (screaming at me until I’m so distressed that I disassociate, gaslighting, threatening to throw me out of the house over minor things).
I also have a lot of anxieties stemming from the way I’ve been treated by my best friend since year five — she used to be angry at me if I got sick, would tell people that I was faking when I was home from school after a car accident, and has made me feel unwelcome in certain social situations.

I have technically forgiven them both. My friend was going trough her own stuff during the period of time when she was really nasty towards me, and has overall always been a great friend. Especially now that she is in a better place! We’ve just always been bad at talking about feelings. 

My dad is a bit trickier, but I’ve made the conscious decision to keep him in my life, after he’s been making changes to better our relationship. I don’t think he’s ever gonna fully understand what he’s done to me, but he has accepted blame.

Thing is, I still get really bitter sometimes. I’ll just stew over all the injustices I feel that I’ve suffered, real dramatic like. I’ll work myself up and relive all those bad moments and think about how nice it would be to confront them, tell them how they’ve made me feel and how it’s still affecting my daily life. I’d never actually do that, and it’s starting to feel like I just work myself up for nothing with my unproductive sulking hour. 

I know that I’ve been treated unfairly, but I don’t want it to hold me back anymore that what it already does. Anger and bitterness is the only ptsd symptoms i really can’t forgive myself for.

bi6ysg,I can't stop reliving the trauma...,"I'm having a hard time. About a month ago I found the strength to tell my psychiatrist about the abuse that I was subjected to growing up. Ever since then, I've been having constant flashbacks... like it all just happened yesterday.

 My psychiatrist/ sleep doctor (I have narcolepsy) is the first person I've told and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I had this expectation that talking about it would be cathartic, but the opposite happened. 

The stress I'm under from the constant flashbacks  and nightmares are exhausting and it's exacerbating my narcolepsy and anxiety. I've tried journaling, getting out and being social, meditation, and I just don't know what else to do. 

I missed 3 days of work this week, and I'm up to probably 6 or 7 call offs. They are covered by FMLA , but there's only so much FMLA available in a year.

bi7swm,I made my triggers my BITCH *trigger warning*,"I've been sexually abused by many older men when I was younger and this trauma seems to follow me around. Usually it's at a job where the abuser is a customer so I change jobs and a different abuser shows up. When I used to use dating websites they would always find me and message me. The list goes on. I would shut down and run from the trigger. Avoid it. Well tonight I went bowling and it was trigger central. #1 I'm an addict alcoholic n I avoiding the bar which is great because when I'm under the influence bad people can control and manipulate me and hurt me. #2 an older guy who abused me as a teen bowled a 300 so his name popped up on the tv in the lane I was at. #3 the bowling alley dj played a song that was my abusers favorite song so very bad memories attached. 

At first I let these things get to me then I remembered I am stronger now and because I'm sober no one can control me and hurt me anymore. Tommorow I have 2 job interviews which could possibly cause me to run into an abuser well guess what u sick fucks I'm not running this time and I'm not scared anymore.

bi86t0,"how do I tell my mom I have PTSD when it’s because I had to take care of her? I may have to admit to smoking weed, but I don’t want her to know it’s because of that.","to keep it short I’ll cut to the chase up here and later give context. how can I tell my mom I’m having a very hard time with ptsd symptoms when it’s because I took care of her, but I don’t want to trigger her because we don’t talk about that time and I don’t want to bring up bad memories for her? only reason why I may have to is because I think she overheard me talking about smoking weed and she may confront me about it. 

my senior year of high school (2017) second semester i took care of my mom when she had debilitating PTSD to the point where the tv couldn’t be on because it was too loud, she couldn’t even drive or go to the grocery store. I slept on the floor next to my bed so I could get up with her throughout the night and try to help her get back to sleep and get her heart rate down, among other things. I nearly didn’t graduate due to it.
fast forward two years, she has a job for the first time in years and is doing so well for herself and may go back to school soon (something she never thought she would accomplish after getting a GED) and has bad days and symptoms (she probably doesn’t tell me about fully ever and just gives an abbreviated version due to our history), but she hasn’t had an anxiety attack or any symptoms near as severe as she did those years ago. I don’t want to trigger her or have her have the guilt of me suffering because of her, or remind her at all of that time while she’s doing so good, and probably won’t go back to therapy unless it gets bad again.
I’ve been needing to smoke weed lately to help my sleeping and appetite and other symptoms. I’m 20 and living with my parents only to save money (and because I love them so much) but I wanted to keep it to myself. I don’t lie to her and would like a legitimate reason to give her.

even if I don’t have to tell her about my habit, how could I even go about that in the future? we love each other a ton and are pretty close but I don’t think I should ever tell her how much that time has affected me.",beesandbabka,2019-04-27 22:51:09,1,442,8.89,34.18,38.39,25.77,29.47,11.09,95.93,65.84,21.04,16.52,9.28,0.68,0,6.33,0.23,4.52,3.62,14.25,12.44,9.5,11.31,3.39,22.4,2.04,0.9,2.04,1.13,1.36,4.52,2.26,2.26,0.45,0.45,0.23,11.76,0.9,0,7.01,0,15.61,1.81,4.07,3.17,3.62,0.9,3.85,0.68,0,0.45,0.23,3.85,0.9,1.36,0,1.13,6.79,1.81,0.68,2.04,2.04,0.68,2.94,14.93,1.81,13.8,1.81,4.98,8.37,1.58,0.23,0.23,0.45,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0.23,0,12.22,2.71,2.04,0,0,0.68,0,0,0,4.98,1.81,0
bi8a87,"Another “memory” nightmare. This time, I get injected with a strong muscle relaxant while trying to save a puppy. Does anyone have any advice on these? TW: sexual assault","The last nightmare I have is being in another body, female, middle eastern, a lot of war and poverty (a friend suggested a girl from Saudi Arabia), and in that dream, I experienced rape and slavery, but worst of all, I “died” by getting shot in the head. It *hurt*. When I woke up, my heart was beating hard in my chest and it took me all day and two Xanax to calm down. 

Last night, I was in a relationship - perhaps legally separated) from abusive boyfriend/husband. We had a daughter who still got weekends there. The daughter is like 6. Very modern, probably America, but I was trying to save a puppy from my “ex” when he injected me with a muscle relaxant so that I couldn’t move. I woke up, but suspect, rape would have happened had I stayed asleep. 

I’ve had these before. But, I think the nightmares are coming from the ptsd rather than the bipolar. I usually don’t dream, I suspect because I don’t reach REM cycle which is what people say happens when you take sleep meds. When I do dream, they’re always intense and now; the nightmares.

bi9bny,Karma cleanses," A few days ago I went back to where my ptsd journey began. It was the home I lived in and witness my mother commit a crime that I remember still vividly even though it was over thirty years ago.

I found my old school, church and a few other tiny familiar things but I was unable to find the apartment. I managed to find one that looked familiar but the configuration of the buildings was wrong. I know this because of a route I used to take when I ditched the school bus and walked home.

I happened to mention this later when I met up with the person I’d come to meet and she said something that made it all click.

“You know there have been a few apartment fires in the area over the time since you lived there.”

At that moment I knew that had to be what happened.

When I got home I searched my states court records and I was able to pull the exact address of the building we lived in from the documents related to my mothers prosecution.

I gps searched the address and BAM. The map skips from one building number to another non sequential number and skips over that building entirely.

The map shows me the exact parking lot I’d been in earlier in the day. If you took away a section of the parking lot and replace it with a building then the addresses and configuration are perfectly aligned.

A little googling later I find out that the place had indeed burned down after a plumber set it ablaze while trying to fix his torch in a bathroom while working on site.

But that’s no the weird part.

No, the weird part is that this meant that the two of the three places where I suffered most in my life have burned down and no longer exist.

The first was faulty electrical wiring and it was the second fire in that home.

I lived there during the first and I woke up and got everyone out.

I almost feel like this is the universe trying to cleanse these spots or something.

I dunno.

What I do know though is that without therapy I wouldn’t have been able to be at the school where I gave the cops my statement, and the parking lot of the place I used to live without having a breakdown.

It’s a sign of major progress and I’m proud of myself.",Buttercup_Bride,2019-04-28 01:52:35,2,418,67.5,20.79,93.61,15.65,18.17,14.59,89.47,57.42,18.18,10.53,9.09,0.24,0.72,0.48,0,7.66,10.29,12.68,7.18,3.83,6.94,1.44,16.99,3.59,1.67,1.91,1.91,3.11,1.67,0.48,1.2,0,0,0.24,3.83,0.48,0,0.72,0.24,11.24,3.11,1.2,0.48,2.87,1.91,2.39,2.63,1.2,0.48,0.96,1.67,0,1.67,0,0,7.42,0.96,2.63,2.39,1.2,0.48,10.29,5.98,0.24,16.51,1.44,9.09,6.22,1.2,0.24,2.15,0,0.48,0,0.48,0,0.24,0.24,0,0.24,7.89,5.26,0.72,0,0,0,0,0,0.48,1.44,0,0

I get angry at the drop of a hat because now that I'm not living at home anymore, I finally feel like I have a right to express my anger at people who wrong me, because I was never allowed to do that living with my father lest I get treated worse. I have a lot of pent up anger against him. When someone is rude to me or talks down to me or even gets mad at me in anyway, I want to turn around and spew anger at them and hurt them. Sometimes I want to cuss them out or just scream at them and it takes every ounce of energy I have not to. I should also mention that because of my anxiety issues, I'm always ""inside my own head"" and don't really pay attention as much as I should, so at times I will leave dishes in the sink at home or forget to do things...this morning my roommate snapped at me about being the only one who cleans (I do clean, but admit that I don't always do as much as I should...again, anxiety and not always paying attention) and I just wanted to go off on her...anytime someone gets snappy with me like that, I just want to run away and cry first, then the anger comes off as a defense mechanism. The next time I move, I want to live by myself...",Sapphira45,2019-04-28 09:37:32,0,330,39.02,14.44,96.79,1,30,12.12,93.94,63.33,20.91,15.15,13.03,0,0,0.61,1.52,5.76,4.55,17.88,7.58,6.97,10,1.82,17.88,4.85,2.73,1.82,0.91,1.21,7.88,0.3,7.58,0.91,4.24,0.61,7.58,0.61,0.3,0.3,0.91,14.24,1.82,1.82,3.03,3.64,2.42,3.33,1.21,0,0.61,0.61,2.12,0.3,1.21,0,0.61,5.45,0.3,0.61,1.52,2.12,0.91,2.12,13.94,0.91,17.58,2.73,7.58,7.27,0.61,0.3,1.21,0.61,0,0,0.3,0,0,0,0,0.3,16.06,7.27,4.24,0,0.61,0,0,0,0.61,2.12,0.61,0.61
bid5d4,Just Started My Journey To Recovery [TW: Childhood Abuse/Coming Out/Getting Kicked Out],"All my life I had to deal with an emotionally abusive and alcoholic father, and a passive mother. Two months ago, it came to a head when I had to come out as gay to them. They didn't take it well. Dad got drunk again, angrily so. And like I resolved to do for some time before that, I called the Sheriff on him for the fourth time in as many weeks. After the cop left, Dad proceeded to scream at me from the other side of my bedroom door for hours, calling me a f\*ggot and a sh\*tpicker, and every variation thereof. The next day he blew up my phone calling me a sexual predator and accusing me of molesting my younger brother, purely because I was gay. He gave me two days to pack my things and leave. I left that night, as my father was sobbing and begging for me \*not\* to go.   


""Just stop calling the police on me. Just promise you'll never call the cops on me again, then you can stay.""  


Been living with Grandma since then. A few weeks later, I had to break off a relationship with a FWB with whom I was extremely close, but who was extremely emotionally abusive and controlling in his own right. I became very deeply suicidal and depressed, and had no choice but to seek professional help. Three weeks ago, I was officially diagnosed by my therapist with PTSD.   


That was such a strange feeling. On one hand, I couldn't believe I was in that bad of a way. Surely others have had it worse than me? But on the other hand, it felt good to know that my parents were wrong and I wasn't just too sensitive or ungrateful. The things I thought were cruel and unfair \*were\* cruel and unfair.   


It's been a horrible time. Irregular sleep, suicidal thoughts, warped sense of time and space; some days go by like hours while some hours seem to last days.There have been so many times in the past couple of months where I just wanted nothing more than to end it. Other times I didn't even feel motivation to do that much. I was dead already.   


But now I am getting help. Now I have my bachelor's degree in Biology, a chance to be in nursing school by August. Now I have come to appreciate my other friends and family all the more. Now I really do want to live. I know it sounds cliche, but it really does get better...",SBishop2014,2019-04-28 09:41:43,0,442,52.33,21.42,98.93,3.77,14.73,14.25,94.8,56.56,16.52,11.31,9.5,0,0.45,0.9,0.45,5.2,5.43,14.25,8.14,6.11,7.24,1.81,15.61,5.66,3.39,0.9,1.13,2.94,5.43,1.58,3.85,0.23,1.13,0.45,7.24,2.04,0.45,0.45,2.26,12.44,3.62,0.9,0.68,1.36,2.26,4.3,2.04,0,0.68,1.13,3.62,0.9,1.36,0.9,0.45,7.01,1.81,0.9,2.49,1.58,0.9,8.37,7.24,0.9,19,2.04,6.33,10.63,1.13,0.68,0.68,0.23,0,0.68,0.45,0,0.23,0,0.23,0,17.87,7.01,4.52,0.23,0.23,0.23,0,0,0.45,1.58,0,3.62

biggyx,GF (32yrs) with PTSD broke up with me (m 30yrs),"My (now) ex gf grew up most of her life suffering from ptsd. Drugs abuse. Almost killing herself a couple times. She had nothing but abusive bfs until she met me. Anyway long story short, in 2017 she checked herself into the hospital because she was suicidal. She's been seeing two good therapists since. She's taking meds for her depression. Our relationship was certainly not normal where it was hard for us to go out because she was slightly agoraphobic. I didn't mind. We went out for an hour once in a while or stayed at her place for movies and dinner. This was her first functional relationship, and she told me she didn't know how to be cared for. We've only been together for 6 months. The first 3 were great but it was started to wane with her. She broke it off with me on the 6th month so she can heal. I've never been more confused and heartbroken. She comforts me when i text her when I'm sad. But that's where I need your help reddit. Should i cease talking altogether? How should i proceed? She says she will always feel for me as more than a friend. Should i should text her something nice once a week? Maybe hangout once a month to check up on her? Normally breakups have people never talking, well at least at the start and then they come back talking if they want many months or years later. I don't know what to do. I love her and i want her to be healed. What is my best option?

i spent two years in an incredibly emotionally abusive and sexually coercive relationship, which culminated in rape. i'm safely out of the situation now, and have a new, healthy relationship.

i have never been consciously uncomfortable having sex with my girlfriend, but every time her hands go [ahem] ""below the belt"", i can't feel anything. without being too graphic, this is not a problem i have when i'm alone. at first we chalked this up to lack of experience, as i'm ftm and she's only ever dated cis guys before, but it's been a year now and i still feel literally nothing past the occasional twinge. is this something other people experience?

He was smiling and laughing. I felt powerless. I'm scared of people not believing me and having nothing come of sharing his name. There's no point of having the cops involved with no proof. But I just don't what to do, I'm numb.  


Two years ago - we were both really drunk. I more so. I blacked out and woke up with my front door unlocked, my anus hurting and I sat in the shower for probably an hour...And blocked it out of my memory.   


Not too long after, I went to therapy and did EMDR. It hit me like a fucking BRICK to the face what had happened. He told me I didn't ""seem"" that drunk. I had saw him not too long afterwards and he wouldn't make eye contact with me.   


But I don't what would come from it. Respect? More shame? Him being ousted by the people who are in bands in this city?

biixcu,Dream or reality?,"Sorry if this isn't the place for this post but I have a strange case. I am a 30 yr old male. When I was 4-6 years old I was raped by babysitter's bf. However, I don't know if this was a dream or reality. My mother is exceptionally aware of her children. I told her about this when I was 18 and again recently. She never saw a shift in my behavior growing up. I was super happy and expressive. I am straight and I am comfortable with my sexuality. I don't have trouble with intimacy. I'm okay around straight and gay men, but if they are very touchy/huggy and give me drama I may have a dream of them raping me. I can really feel the sensation there despite never touching myself there - like how it felt back when I was a child. It feels like it was a dream, but how can a child have this imagination? I mean maybe it's because one of my earliest memories is seeing a sex scene in a movie. I'm physically healthy, is there a way to find out if I was really raped? We don't know the babysitter anymore (it's been nearly 3 decades). I'm concerned this could turn into ptsd or some kind of mental breakdown if the right conditions are met.

The terrible memories of my parents fighting, the fear, having to distance myself from yelling or aggressive behavior because it felt like I was back there hearing them. A lot people mentioned PTSD, some even complex PTSD, which I didn’t know existed. I’ve come hear because I don’t want to make a big deal out of it unless i need to talk to someone, but my question is whether is sounds like I may have PTSD, because I figured who better to ask for advice about getting tested than people who know a lot about it.

bik85s,Does PTSD have to come from one event? And does it have to be life threatening?,"Someone suggested to me that I have symptoms in line with PTSD because of my job. I’m a teacher who has gone through a very tough year. 
Long story short, I’ve had elementary students try and gaslight me, yell at me, call me names, hit, kick, bite, scratch, and throw things at me. I’ve called to my administrators for assistance when things get violent and I was told “we have no one to help you.” After being hit and had something thrown at me (and my emotions are escalated), I am supposed to attempt to deescalate the student who just physically assaulted me. And when I spoke of these concerns to my administrator, I was told “your standards are too high.” 
I have been having nightmares, anxiety, depression, etc. and was recommended a therapist. Before I go, I wanted to get some more info that Google hasn’t been much help with. 

So my questions- does PTSD have to come from one traumatic event? Can it come from repeated “smaller” traumas that seem to snowball?
And does it always have to be life threatening? I’ve never been in a life threatening situation at school/my job, but the constant struggles have really taken a toll on me.

bikrla,Need to find online mental health resources for my little sister,"My sister is 16 and her ex-bf sexually assaulted her a few months ago. It was kind of covert assault, if you can call it that. He admitted to her recently that he did stuff even though he knew she didn’t want him to, and even when she quit kissing him and just lay there, he would keep going (she was too scared to say anything). She’s been having trouble sleeping and has been feeling depressed, but she refuses to ask our mom for therapy because her twin sister is already going for anxiety and she doesn’t want to be a financial burden. I tried to explain to her that her mental health is more important, but she did have a point: our parents, however wonderful they may be, are a bit skeptical of mental health, and I also don’t think they agree that what happened to my sister was assault and that she should just get over it.

bikt6t,Overcoming my fear,"For context, I'm currently a high school junior (17F) and have been attending the same school as my abuser for 4 years. We dated for one year but he kept me under his thumb with physical, mental, verbal, and emotional abuse for 3 years. He is the main reason for my PTSD and made half of my high school a living hell. We had classes together and hang out in similar spots, and normally I can't be around him without having flashbacks and panic attacks. I dissociate and start getting paranoid and typically my friends have to form a physical barrier between us any time he's in the area. 

Yesterday was my prom, and he went. I had no idea he was going, and honestly, I probably wouldn't have gone if I had known. My friend leaned over and whispered into my ear that he was here and instead of freaking out like I thought I would I just nodded. I'm not going to lie, my heart sunk into my feet and I felt terrified for a few seconds. But then it passed. I still felt afraid but it was more of a little hum in the back of my mind than the typical all-encompassing terror.

I went with them to dance and forgot he was there entirely. I had a good time, ate food, and just messed around and for once, I was a kid. I wasn't the shaking victim or the person who had to grow up too fast, I was just a regular high schooler having fun with my friends. Eventually, when I left the dancefloor for food I made eye contact with him, and I didn't feel anything I thought I would. I felt a little ""Oh shit"" but other than that, my mind was blank. It was like I was making eye contact with a distant acquaintance I had once known. I got my food and went back to the floor and had a good time with my friends, we even danced next to his group without me freaking out, I even forgot they were there. 

I never thought I would hit this point, I never thought I would be able to look him in the eyes. I never thought I would be able to be a kid again. I never thought I would be able to even be in the same room as him. But I could, and I did and it's just... It's crazy.

My emotions are a jumble right now, I'm so damn happy and proud because I could be a kid again, but also sad because I realized how much I've missed out on. I'm also kind of sad because in a way, the fear was the last part of the relationship I had left, and after so long it feels weird to not have it anymore. It's a kind of happiness mixed with sadness. I'm a mess but I'm happy and I don't really have anyone IRL to talk to, so here you go internet.

bikuhj,Working through PTSD in therapy [tw: abuse + sexual assault],"I've been seeing my therapist for a couple years and the main reason was to help with PTSD. I ended up cowarding out numerous times but now we're actually getting into it and attempting to work through it. Logically, I know that my abuser (ex gf) will not come back and I will never see her again and know that what happened, unfortunately happened, but it is not happening /now/. Even though I know this, it doesn't help.

I cannot physically speak about it. No matter how long I sit there going through the events in my head -- I can never speak about it. Writing is fine. But I cannot speak like something is holding my mouth shut. This is causing some issues with getting things out there for therapy...

[Some background: I was raped numerous times, have gotten blackout drunk to the point I couldn't move and just lay there to try and be okay with the sexual advances, guilted, emotionally and mentally abused, manipulated, was made into the abuser somehow, etc.
This happened right after high school with an older woman (I am FTM) around 4 to 5 years ago now. I still have nightmares about being raped again or her coming back. I cannot go to some places without a panic attack happening or being extremely uncomfortable. I cannot say her name.]

When bringing it up or talking about it, I disassociate intensely and just forget what I say, forget what happened, and don't remember what happened in therapy once I come back.
I've planned on writing about events that I can remember and giving them to my therapist to read.

But is there a way or does anyone have experience or advice in keeping yourself grounded through it? Disassociating throughout my session is not helping but I can't find a way to stay.",nekoomancerr,2019-04-28 21:32:06,4,316,19.66,10.87,98.13,2.8,16.63,19.3,92.72,57.91,17.41,10.44,8.54,0.32,0.32,0.95,0.32,6.96,3.16,12.66,9.81,9.49,7.28,4.75,23.73,2.22,0.95,1.9,0.95,1.27,5.06,1.27,3.8,0.63,2.53,0,6.96,0,0.32,1.58,0,13.92,2.53,1.58,0.32,3.8,0.95,6.65,2.53,0.63,1.58,0,4.11,0.63,1.9,1.27,0.32,6.01,1.27,1.58,2.85,1.27,0,4.75,15.19,1.27,17.09,2.85,8.23,7.28,2.22,0.32,0,0,0,0,0.95,0,0.32,0.32,0,0,17.41,6.01,4.11,0.63,0,0.32,0,0.63,0,2.22,1.27,2.22

bin2fo,I’m so sick of people telling me...,"That I should talk to my parents. That it’s “so sad” I cut them out of my life. It’s not sad, it’s the best god damn thing I’ve ever done for my mental health. They continue to deny my trauma, gaslight me and protect my abuser. They punished my daughter and refused to see her because they were mad at me, and that was the wake up I needed to their bull.

My entire childhood was spent being gaslighted about my feelings, being told no, being brow beaten Into who they thought I should be while refusing to do anything to help me. When I told them what he did to me as a child, they didn’t care. They’d rather bury their heads in the sand and expect me to “let it go” because it’s easier for them. Not once did they ever give a single shit what I was going through. They paraded me to the family when I was put in a psych ward to say “see look how loving we are” but not even a week prior my mom told me “you didn’t really try to kill your self or you’d be dead”.

I tried everything I could to fix things with them, gave them every opportunity to be a part of my journey and they didn’t want to. That’s not on me. I will not be sorry for refusing to poison my peace with people who don’t care what I’m going through. 

Sorry to rant but I needed to vent. People just have no clue what it’s like to live in fear of my trauma. To live in endless loops of it, to hear my abusers voice at night when my husband talks or see his face when my husband touches me.

bio3st,Alcohol and PTSD can be such a bad concoction.,"I’ve always liked to drink. I’ve never had good control over my drinking, but some. I never drank frequently but I would drink a lot. 

Ever since I started working on things more in depth in therapy, all I want to do is drink. I’ve had a couple of blackouts and I recognize this is a problem. My biggest issue is that I don’t want to stop drinking. I like drinking, but I want to drink in moderation. 

I’m frustrated because I know I have no self-control lately. I’ve set a “drink limit” for one sitting and I stuck to it once or twice.. but usually I just sail passed it thinking “just a couple more”. 

I know the end all is no drinking at all. But is there ever a middle ground?

bioug2,**Trigger Warning** How do you cope when a trigger is your family? (Long post sorry),"I had a very abusive childhood. I grew up with a mentally ill, physically dying, abusive, single parent mother. She was fighting hepatitis c and is a cancer survivor, and so we were constantly in and out of hospitals with various life threatening problems. Due to that fact, and while I was 12-13 doctors tried to cure it with pegatron (which is sort of like chemo), I grew up constantly aware that I might lose my only parent any day, at any time. I grew up grieving her. But also she was always using her illness as a way to manipulate myself and my sister into obeying her every desire. She constantly gaslit us, emotionally manipulated, physically abused, and neglected our safety. I'm not going to go into detail as I am aware that others might share my experience and be triggered. But suffice it to say, I had a very complicated, difficult, and abusive relationship with my mother. Whatever her reasons, she was my major abuser (among others) for my entire life up until around 4 years ago. That's when, with the help of my husband, councillor, psychiatrist, and family doctor, I cut her out of my life. I had a mental breakdown that had been teetering at a breaking point for years. It was really bad, and I'm still mentally recovering, but I honestly know I'll never be the same. I was told by my doctor to think of her as dead, for my own personal safety and well-being, both physically and emotionally. It was the hardest thing I have ever done or probably will ever do. I'm sure I don't need to explain that a relationship with an abuser isn't always being abused, and it isn't always negative. I have/had a lot of happy memories with her, which is what makes the abuse hurt all the more. Along with her I had to cut out a lot of other family members, including my grandpa. 
I wanted to give a gist of the situation because I recently saw my grandpa after 4 years by chance at my family doctors. My PTSD has been bad receltly because of it I think. But I want to have lunch with him because I feel badly about cutting him out. But I needed to because he didn't see the abuse, or didn't think it was enough for my reaction and actions taken. I don't think he does still. He lives with my mother (who is hep c free now btw). 
How do you deal with knowingly walking into a situation that will trigger you, and possibly push your recovery back? Am I stupid for wanting to see him again? I know I'm going to have more episodes, I know I'm going to disassociate more often, I know my brain is going to try to protect me. But I can't not see him, can I? I don't want to live with regretting this because of my own limitations. 
But I'm scared. My husband won't be there with me because my grandpa is really mean to him (he's said horrible things to and about him), and he thinks it's a ""terrible idea.""

biowg4,Proud,Just needed to brag a bit. My family says I don’t give myself enough credit with how far I’ve come with managing ptsd.  Well it is hard sometimes to see your own growth. Yesterday was the anniversary of losing 2 brother over seas.  2 separate deployments. Same day.  Every year it hits me hard.   Don’t need to go into details. I’m sure u all know.  Well this year I didn’t crawl in a bottle!!! I didn’t run from my emotions. I felt them all day and today I feel great.   Like a massive weight has been lifted.        Crazy how much support I got from the veterans on reddit.   Prior to the day I called some key members of my support group.  Let them know where my head and heart was.

bisgqc,Need Advice on a Break In/Sexual Assault Situation,"Im new to Reddit and this is my first post, so my apologies if this is not the right subreddit/I'm in the wrong place, but I'd love to get some advice on this issue. 

So, about a year and a half ago during my senior year of college, I got home from a day of tailgating and football around 10 pm. I lived in a house with 4 roommates, but all of them were still out at a party at the time I got home. 

I went to sleep and woke up 6 hours later, around 4 am. A man was laying in bed with me, with his hand down my pants. I mumbled ""what are you doing?!"" while still feeling half asleep, but hearing myself say that out loud woke me up. 

It was very dark in my room, but the figure jumped over me and ran out. I turned my lamp on and sat on the edge of my bed for a second trying to make sense of what had just happened. I truly started to convince myself that it was all a dream. I couldn't understand how he walked across my room and got into my bed without waking me up.

Shaking, I woke up all of my roommates to tell them what happened and we noticed that the front door was left open when the intruder ran out. So one of my roommates frantically calls the police as I just sit there dumbfounded. The police let us know that they were already right down the street because our neighbor called and reported a man standing in her bedroom only 30 minutes earlier. 

They never caught the guy and I've had countless questions pop into my head about it since.

Was his plan to take it further but he got too frightened? What was he trying to get out of this? Had he been watching us/our house? Has he done this to anyone else since? 

I consider myself very lucky, because the situation could have gone a whole lot differently. Especially if he had some sort of weapon to threaten me with. 

I've never been a particularly fearful person and being alone had never bothered me, but this break in completely stripped my sense of security. Now, when I'm home alone or walking somewhere alone, I'm extremely afraid, and irrational thoughts pop into my head.

For example, the other night I worked myself up so much that I was worried someone had been stalking me and was waiting downstairs to ambush me when I walked into the kitchen. 

For weeks after the break in, I would wonder ""is that him?"" about every man I walked past on the street. I never talked to anyone about it, because, in all honestly, I downplayed it and told myself ""you weren't raped, you're fine."" But it's almost impossible for me to be alone anymore- normal, tiny creaks in the house will keep me up all night. 

I'm 23 years old and I don't feel like it's normal for me to be so paranoid, especially since I can remember how ""fearless"" I once was. So, is this something that warrants talking to a professional? Or have I just gotten in my head to much about this situation?",cure_4_curiosity_,2019-04-29 10:51:27,0,557,35.81,28.28,98.48,6.09,17.41,13.64,94.61,61.4,21.01,14.9,10.95,0.9,0.54,1.8,0.72,5.92,5.39,15.8,9.52,7.54,7.54,1.62,18.85,3.59,1.08,1.62,2.15,2.15,4.67,1.44,3.23,1.62,0.9,0.72,8.44,0,0.9,0.18,2.33,13.29,2.51,1.62,1.26,3.41,2.87,3.05,1.97,0.36,0.54,0.54,1.97,1.08,0.18,0.36,0.18,7.9,1.97,0.9,2.87,1.8,0.54,10.05,7,0.36,20.65,1.97,10.77,7.18,1.26,0.72,3.23,0,0,0,0.18,0,0.18,0,0,0,14.54,4.13,4.31,0,0,1.44,0.18,0.18,1.44,2.33,0,0.54

bitio1,Flashback and a Dissociative Break,"*this is a long post, so thank you for reading*

I’ve been thinking recently about an event I had last September that I’d like to get other opinions on, and I figured I’d share it here.

Last September I attended a camping music festival in Denver. Fun was had, and I participated in a decent amount of drug use. I only mention it here because I think it’s incredibly relevant to the topic of discussion.

I was on a pretty decent dose of MDMA on the night in question (I don’t know the specifics on dosage but this pill in particular has been making the rounds as a VERY strong one), as well as a fair amount of weed. My partner and I tend to talk about my abusive ex/ past trauma when we roll (take MDMA) together, as it lowers a lot of my inhibitions and I feel less difficulty in discussing specifics of my abuse. This ex in question is also his (now ex) best friend, but that’s all beside the point.

Here’s the short of it - my ex came up in conversation, my partner asked me if I’d like him to confront him at some point in the future, and I had a flashback. I have flashbacks pretty often, but this is one I haven’t had since the specific memory itself happened irl, about 7 years ago. It’s an especially graphic one for me to have remembered at all, let alone on drugs, and it triggered what I can only describe as a dissociative break.

I immediately felt cold and disconnected from my body. I looked down at my hands and feet and couldn’t move them. I forgot what I had just said, and would continue to black out every couple of seconds with no way to recollect my words/thoughts for the entirety of this episode. I didn’t recognize my friends for a couple of minutes, and I immediately asked my partner and roommate to move me somewhere without people (we were in stadium seating) so I could sit down - I needed help walking and couldn’t feel my feet. I was frightened of everybody around me, including my partner, and made eye contact only when absolutely necessary. I couldn’t speak more than a word or two at a time for about an hour.

This episode took me about three hours to “come back from”, and it took me about three weeks to feel semi-normal afterwards. I was often especially frightened of my partner during this time, flinching on contact and making little eye contact. I frankly couldn’t stand to be near him until I saw my therapist for the first time post-episode.

Has anybody dealt with anything like this, or even have an idea on what it might be classified as? I dissociate relatively often (less now, but still often), and I have NEVER experienced anything close to this either before or afterwards. While I do think it’s in part due to my drug use at the time, I think it correlated heavily with my PTSD and the severity of the flashback as well. I’m not looking for medical advice, or shame for my drug use, I just want to know what to tell my new therapist when it inevitably comes up.

Thank you for listening. ❤️",megrose995,2019-04-29 12:21:23,7,557,47.79,23.63,97.72,35.16,22.28,17.95,94.08,59.43,18.85,12.75,11.13,0.36,0.36,0.72,0.18,5.92,5.39,17.06,8.08,7.36,7.9,1.97,16.88,4.85,3.41,1.26,1.44,2.69,4.49,2.51,1.97,0.72,0.54,0.36,8.08,0,1.97,0,0.72,14.54,3.59,1.62,1.62,3.59,2.69,2.87,3.23,1.26,0.72,1.08,2.87,1.08,1.8,0,0.18,5.21,2.51,0.36,1.62,0.9,0.36,5.57,9.52,0.36,17.77,1.44,7.72,8.08,0,0.72,0.18,0,0,0,1.26,0,0,0.18,0.36,0,15.26,4.13,4.31,0,0,0.18,0,0.72,0.36,3.05,1.8,0.72
bitolv,(TW) Afraid to engage in Sexual behavior after assault NSFW,"I’m a victim of sexual assault (borderline rape even, but my mom refused to call it that) when i was 13? I have moved on from my abuser (even though I’m forced to see him almost daily) and i’m slowly recovering from the trauma.  

Currently i’m with a boy who’s really sweet and respectful, he knows about my PTSD and anxiety. We’ve thought about engaging in sexual behavior previously, but it’s not something that absolutely needs to happen. It would be nice but it’s not a necessity.

Here’s the overall issue. So far i can watch anything that is sexual and not have any problems (unless it’s a rape happening on screen or news about a rape, then i get a trigger) but I have no idea at all if I’ll be ok when it comes to actually doing it. If anyone has gone through this issue, i’d love to hear how to help with this situation...

bj0grg,"I went to therapy, turned out I have PTSD (trigger warning) l’m doing better but I’m scared I’ll go back to not doing better.","I went because I had anxiety for several months that started to become physical, I would feel nauseous, going to class was not a thing anymore I even failed five courses, I was lying about how I was doing to my family, and I felt like I was dying all the time for many many months and even in a span of five years or more. 

The first meeting I spilled many things that happened to me as a kid trying to pin point why this was happening and if my brain was just reacting late. Some events include sexual abuse from a family member, car accident during a family’s funeral from two members is the family. 

Turns out many things i experience are not suppose to happen to “normal” people: flashbacks of events out of nowhere that would cause me to zone out and loose focus, horrible things that would pop into my head, I get startled very easily and people have found this out and think it’s funny but I don’t like it at all, I’m sensitive to loud noises and they make me panic or fear something is going to happen to someone, loss of memory (she explained that all those years trying to push back the memories caused me to push back other things too?), certain areas people touch me make me react very angry, it has been hard for my to show affection to others (this has gotten better though), people that look like the person that abused me make me remembered being pinned down by him or other events, and so many other things like eating disorders after that finished happening. 

I still feel like it’s all in my head and I’m just making this up though, which is what the person that caused all my trauma made me think in the first place. 

I found this out a year ago and I stopped going to therapy because I felt vulnerable sharing what happened for the first time. It made me feel gross knowing that someone else knows what happened. 

I’m having a hard day today because I’m retaking a class I failed because someone there looked like him the first time I took the class. I stopped going to it completely. But now I’m getting an A, and I’m looking back to that first time, I should feel happy I’m doing better but it just feels weird and scared that I will get anxiety again and feel horrible and fail. The anxiety stemmed from many many things but the abuse was one of them, I guess it catches on to you after years of pushing it out of your mind. 

I know this is long so thank you to whoever read this, I’m trying my best to not stop going to classes and to keep doing my best but it’s not easy when I start feeling the anxiety coming back.",noodleslirp,2019-04-30 00:21:33,3,511,32.77,15.44,96.75,5.18,39.31,12.92,96.28,57.34,22.11,12.13,10.57,0,0.59,0.59,0.39,9.98,4.5,12.72,8.81,5.09,7.05,1.37,22.31,5.28,2.94,1.57,1.76,2.94,7.83,2.94,4.89,2.35,0.98,0.78,5.48,0.59,0,0.2,0.39,16.24,4.11,3.52,0.98,2.74,1.57,4.31,3.91,0.78,0.39,2.54,1.76,0.59,0.78,0.2,0.2,7.24,1.17,3.52,1.76,2.15,1.57,6.07,9.98,1.57,14.68,2.94,5.09,7.63,1.96,0.59,0.59,0,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.55,2.54,3.72,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,0.39,3.33,1.17,0
bj0q8h,Why is it so hard for people to understand?,"I don’t know how many times I’ve tried to reach out to people. I’m very conserved so this is usually when I’m very upset and I just can’t do life anymore so I just get into an argument. A cry for help really.
How do I get people to understand? Everyone just thinks I’m lazy because I don’t have motivation (late to school, behind, can’t clean my room) I always have my mental well-being before school which has been a big negative because no one understands, so my parents punish me which makes me even more stressed and depressed which makes me triggered more. It’s a loop really. When i finally open up (arguing because that’s when I’ve given up) they say you aren’t even trying, you treat me horrible and they talk about their problems. Then I want to help them and I don’t mean to treat them horrible it’s just what I am when I’m triggered.

bj1au5,Obsessive thoughts related to trauma or something unrelated?,"I go through periods where all I can think about are the dimensions of rooms. Not the room I'm in at the time. Rooms from the barracks, rooms from my childhood home.

I can literally spend hours simply mapping out various places in my mind. 

Basically I'm pretty sure this is trauma related but maybe not? Maybe it's just me being weird or anal or on the spectrum (I'm not, that I know of, that's a lame joke).

I feel that because of my increased anxiety because I'm trying to talk about it more openly with people I end up being really irritable and fiesty in conversations

What should I do? how can I apologise and stop my mental health from getting in between me and people I know? I just end up shouting because I'm so scared and angry, I'm so lost! What do you guys do in these situations?

bj3lkc,I am so scared,"I don’t know how to explain how scared I am. I am running out of money and I don’t know what to do. I am living in a country where I no longer have the right to work. I have been scraping by for a long time, but it’s getting to the point where I can only hold on for one for month.

I have PTSD, OCD and depression. I have been depressed for about 22 years. I no longer have any friends. I am estranged from my abusive family.

I take medication as prescribed by a psychiatrist, but there is no way for me to afford therapy. 

I spend most of my time in bed, anxious, thinking about killing myself. I feel trapped and paralyzed. I am afraid of losing my apartment and of having nowhere to go.

As a foreigner in this country, I have been victimized many times, both because I didn’t know my rights and because people have used my status against me as a form of threat or blackmail. I can’t afford a lawyer.

I have been to just about every free legal counseling center and association and they all say pretty much the same thing and that there’s nothing they can do for me.

My computer broke and I can’t figure out how to fix it. My ex is going to cut the WiFi soon since he insisted on cutting it rather than transferring it to my name, and I can’t afford to buy a new subscription.

On a typical day, I wake up late (ten to eleven am), lie in bed for ten minutes until the cacophony in my brain is too much to bear, take my medication, eat something, try to tidy up or clean my apartment, go outside for a while, to buy groceries or smoke a cigarette, come back inside, get back in bed, curl up in the fetal position with my hand between my legs ( I was sexually abused and I do this compulsively when I am anxious or scared), stay in bed distracting myself online, more or less unsuccessfully, only getting up to pee, take my second dose of my benzodiazepines at seven, cook dinner, wash my face, brush my teeth, back to bed where I take a sleeping pill that works eighty percent of the time.

I constantly think either about the various traumatic things I’ve experienced, or about finding a way out of my situation, but no matter how much I think, where I go, what numbers I call, who I talk to, nothing changes. No doors open.

Lately I have been thinking about either suicide or just running away and hitchhiking around, trying to find a way to live for free, or even going deep into the forest and starving, or deep into the sea and drowning.

That’s all. I don’t know what to do.

I live in a city with a large community of artists - musicians, poets, painters, columnists, people who make podcasts, comedians, etc. After 2 years, I finally gave the name of the man who raped me who plays in a band that's locally popular.**

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago, I invited him over. We did drink and I did black out...then woke up to my front door unlocked, an empty condom wrapping on the floor and me in pain. It was like the scene in *Girl with the Dragon Tattoo* when she goes back to her place and takes a shower...and you can see the blood in the bathtub.   


I had even texted him that morning askiing what happened and I didn't remember having sex. He said I ""didn't seem THAT drunk."" And I locked that memory away for about a year. My anxiety had flare ups and I decided to go to therapy. After doing a couple of EMDR sessions, the memory hit me like a brick without anything prompting it while I was at work. I ran into the bathroom and hyperventilated. **But I decided to keep it to myself.** I feared the criticisms.   


***Well you were drunk, it was your fault for putting yourself in that situation.*** 

***Everything is going to think you're a dirty slut.*** 

***No one is going to believe you.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

But recently, after seeing his face at shows multiple times. A new intrusive thought came into my head. I took a shower last night and it kept saying, ***what are you going to do?*** It's funny, I was watching Bojack Horseman and a quote really stuck out to me that kind of inspired me:  


***""You gotta get your shit together. So you took some licks, but you're gonna bounce back because you're talented, you're smart and, goddammit, you're good. You are a goddamn American treasure, you know that?""***

&amp;#x200B;

I decided I had to do it. It wasn't for me, it was for people who would be continued to be hurt by him. I don't even want an apologies, it doesn't take back what happened. But I want him to be affected in his life like I have been these past couple of years. I'm happy I have a supportive boyfriend now who said whatever happens, he's here. I'm glad my abuser doesn't know where I live or where I work...I am scared. But I feel a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.

I'll be okay for an hour then I ""disappear"" again. Ive started isolating myself at work and hiding in my office because having basic conversations is beginning to be too difficult. Even at home where I normally feel my most comfortable I can't seem to get a grip. 

I had a scheduled vacation from work and spent nearly all of it unable to get off the couch. I promised my kid that I'd take her somewhere and I couldn't even muster that. I just wanted to enjoy my days off, but they were a total waste. I feel like my life is just floating by and I'm missing it. I just can't seem to even figure out why this is happening or what's triggering it. I just want to feel normal. Nothing seems to make it last for long.

bj7dry,My True Story; trauma mental &amp; physical.,"I've considered  sharing my story for a while as I believe it would be therapeutic for me. However, the idea of reliving these horrible events is paralyzing. I've learned to endure through detachment. Please bear with my story is long and complex.

I am 46 years old widow, mother of 3,  and survivor of several traumatic events. 

I was and am by nature a very loving and caring individual. A true nurtured. At a very young age I'd determined I wanted to be a nurse. I graduated from college becoming an RN at 23. I landed my dream job working in surgery, which I excelled.

My husband was a highly educated and was an LPC (therapist). He was the love of my life, but he was also the cause of many difficulties. He was drawn to Psychology due to wanting to understand himself. Being adopted and a military brat was the sourse of much of his problems. Or, so I believed. He battled with depression and substance abuse. However, it became apparent he was bipolar. He began a slippery slope of substance abuse and severe depression. His erratic behavior and substance abuse resulted in his repeated loss of employment. My life's purpose became supporting my family and keeping my husband alive. 

Along with employment changes Hurricane Katrina damaged our home and destroyed both of our parents homes. As both our parents lived on waterfront property. We rebuilt only to experience the effects of the Gulf Oil Spill. This seems to be the onset of major events.

My grandfather, father, and father-in law, all became increasingly ill. My grandfather passed away first. Shortly afterwards my father was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, which was terminal. Exactly one week later my father-in-law died from kidney failure.
My father was sent 2 states away for treatment in Little Rock, Arkansas. 
Next, my husband's mental health began to deteriorate, while his substance abuse increased. Just after our 19th wedding anniversary he committed suicide. 

These string of events were all within 1 years time. My husband's death was my tipping point. I as RN was helpless to prevent any of these illnesses and deaths. Upon learning of my husband's death I went into shock! The anguish was unbearable. It was as if my mind was a skipping record. I developed severe fears. Nothing would ease this mental anguish. I didn't sleep nor eat. I felt like I was drowning.

I dispise when people say ""things can't get worse"". Because they can and they often do. 

You see a man sought me out through hearing my story on Facebook. This man turned out to be a con artist, who manipulated women for money. He befriended me, then spared no time stealing my account information and life insurance. He also stole my Hummer. I filed a report with the Sheriff's department and the FBI. With their help my son got my Hummer back. Two weeks later, 6 months after my husband's death, my father went into a coma. His MD in LR, Arkansas called my brothers and I  to see him. I packed the hummer and waited for my son to arrive. Unfortunately, this man came to my house to steal the hummer again. I tried to intervene begging him to allow me to see my father. But, instead he ran me over crushing my pelvis. 

I should not be alive. In fact, I was angry I was alive until I realized I had to fight. I couldn't leave my children orphaned. I was in a coma at the same time my father was. My father passed away while I was in the hospital. I've have extensive surgeries. And spent most of almost 2 years in the hospital. I had an open wound in my thigh for 2 years.

It's been almost 6 years since my husband's death. A little more than 5 years since my accident. And 8 months since my last surgery. (A spinal fusion) I am whole again. I am grateful that I am alive. 

My life has been dedicated to my children. However, my youngest will soon be a Senior. So, it's imperative I re-establish myself in society. I'm now trying to rebuild my career. I've been on disability since the accident. I recently took classes and reinstated my nursing license. But, taking this next step paralyzing!

These things changed me. I'm no longer the person I once was. I became numb, but I am trying to learn to feel again. I didn't think I'd ever be able to practice as a nurse again. The fear is overwhelming. I am trying to will myself to start over. I believe it's the only way to conquer my fears.",Misbelieve,2019-04-30 12:21:43,4,793,52.93,32.5,88.23,3.25,9.55,19.92,88.4,52.08,18.54,15.89,12.48,0.63,0.13,2.27,0.38,2.65,5.04,12.86,8.95,3.28,5.93,1.13,16.02,4.67,2.27,0.5,1.89,1.51,5.67,1.64,4.04,0.63,1.01,0.76,10.34,3.53,0.25,0.25,5.3,9.84,3.15,1.64,1.01,1.39,1.26,2.02,1.26,0.5,0.25,0.25,4.41,0.63,3.53,0,0.13,7.82,2.77,1.77,2.27,0.88,0.76,7.82,6.43,0.5,13.75,2.02,4.92,6.94,2.52,0.63,0.5,0.63,0,1.51,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.16,10.21,3.28,0,0.25,0,0.25,0.5,0.25,2.77,0.5,0.13

bj9xdv,"Trigger Warning: gaslighting &amp; abuse - for the rest of my life, I will always be in the wrong and that will never change.","**Please be aware I will be talking about manipulation, gaslighting, mental illness, suicide, parental death, and abuse mentally and sexually (including child s.abuse). Do not feel obligated to read if this would be uncomfortable for you.

This is also extremely long, literally talking abt many examples thru my life. I struggle with words, I’m sorry.**

I made a throwaway because a portion of this is about some people who somehow found my main account and used my personal venting against me when I was hurt. In fact, I’m still fucking terrified they’ll find this and know this is the same person somehow. I’ve not talked about this thread but idk I’m rambling. 

I’m in my 20’s and trauma happens like a calendar event every few years, it’s like a timer. That would be a funny punchline if this didn’t fuck me up so much in a horrible way.

When I was sexually abused as a kid and I told my parents years later, it was on me to “talk to” my rapist about how I felt. I was told to get over it.

When I took my mom to therapy with me once so I could tell her how she treats me makes me feel bad, how she’s passive aggressive and talks down to me, she turned it on me like she wasn’t a problem. In later appointments, my therapist said it was my fault I’m still stuck in that house and that if I just applied to her husbands restaurant and got a job, then I’d be free.

When I was in an abusive relationship, my ex boyfriend would make me do things and I’d do them. He’d then get mad at me for doing exactly what he asked me to do, for some other made up reason. When he would say mean things to me, insult me, or control me, and I would tell him that it hurt my feelings, he would turn it on me. How could I make him feel bad? He’s such a good person to me. He doesn’t deserve that.  My punishment was to give him oral, or full on penetration sex, whichever mood he was in. 

Leaving that relationship because he was abusive...he told me I was the abusive one. He said I told him things to “hold him hostage”. All of the examples he listed were things he told me to keep ME in the relationship (like “I’ll kill myself if you leave me!) and I was the one in the wrong.

When I tried casually dating, I made it very clear to this boy I was seeing that it was not exclusive and that I just got out of a bad relationship and would like to have freedom talking to many people. He was a self proclaimed feminist, he told me not to worry. We will get back to him momentarily. 

During that time, I met up with a traveler. I explicitly told him I’m not interested in a hook up, it will not happen. We hung out and he ended up trapping me in his hotel room. I told him again I wasn’t hooking up, but I was scared since he was drunk, and I just let things happen, like he thought I just needed to be “persuaded” I asked if he had a condom. He left the room and I heard crinkling in the bathroom. He came back out and I just let it happen. Afterwards he didn’t get up...I asked where the condom was. He said oh it fell off somewhere or something! I called his bluff. He admitted there was no condom. I told him that was wrong and he tried manipulating, saying “I’m such a monster, I’m such a piece of shit and I should feel horrible” so I wouldn’t feel bad. It was to make him look more innocent after raping me. 

When I told the guy I had gone on some dates with that I was literally raped, he yelled at me. He told me it’s my fault he’s depressed because I won’t sleep with him. I’ll fuck someone else, but I won’t fuck him, and I’m a bad person since it’s my fault I was making him depressed for not sleeping with him. He never once asked me for sex before this. 

Two years ago, my dad died. I watched him become nothing. It killed the person I used to be and I had to start caring about myself more. I always put other people first. My friends often told me “Sorry, I’m too upset right now, I can’t help you with your problem.” And I’d respect that. I care about their mental health and they don’t need my shit weighing on them too. Turns out, I didn’t have that same privilege. 

When I was sent a post by a trusted friend that was about me on my best friends blog saying I’m a bad person for “ghosting” my friends (something I did not do), she lied when I asked her. I then discovered all the other passive aggressive posts she wrote were about me. I had no idea. She denied everything, made up excuses, said it was about other people. I didn’t believe her. Her partner at the time made a status for me to see, another passive aggressive post, saying it’s wrong for someone to have betrayed their partners trust by telling me about this post that was about me on their “private” (it was public and I followed it) blog. That confirmed it was about me. And it also blamed me and the person who just wanted me to know the truth. It’s my fault for being emotionally compromised and completely traumatized after watching my dad die. 

When I was told that two of my other friends were saying awful, vile, mean shit about me, I confronted them. One told me it was on me for all of these many reasons that were basically him projecting on me. The other said she felt violated and that she couldn’t trust anyone because that comment wasn’t meant for me to see, and how she’s hurt because she’s betrayed by whoever sent me the comment. It took me a long time to recover from all of this. Undoing so many toxic beliefs, intrusive thoughts that kept telling me that because of these last two situations, all my friends secretly hated me. No one really liked me. 

But I healed. I trusted that my friends cared about me. I was thriving. I was doing so well. I was medicated for ADHD, PTSD, Panic disorder, GAD, MDD. Then this past week and a half happened. My coworkers and I were talking lunch and I brought up my sexuality, and a weird convo I had about it. This isn’t weird, we were mostly all on the LGBT spectrum in some way. One person talked about my sexuality and saying some uneducated things about it. I patiently and kindly explained why they were misunderstood, because they didn’t identity the same way so I didn’t expect them to know! I’ll just take my time and educate them. They argued with me though...about my own identity. I felt so invalidated. I would never do that to their sexuality nor anyone else’s. My other coworkers let it happen. They didn’t see a problem with the argument. That original person and I had a convo tho, and we met in the middle and was all okay. We were “good”. 

I still felt hurt. I wanted to talk more about why I was hurt...but not then. I was too upset. I decided to seek support in a subreddit for this sexuality, talking anonymously about what happened and how awful it made me feel. Everyone else was as anonymous as possible. Nobody there knows me or these people I were talking about. Once I was cooled off enough to talk to everyone and I had my thoughts together, my coworkers had stopped coming to lunch. I assumed they’re busy or have days off. One person had a lot of personal things going on. I find out soon that I’m completely blocked and the original person will not respond to me, won’t say anything. Their friend said they “don’t know what’s going on”. A few more days pass and I talk to the last person. It took a while, they were busy, had personal things, or whenever I felt mentally ready to talk they were gone for the day already. There were so many reasons why I didn’t talk immediately. 

They told me that they’re upset because they read my Reddit post and that it isn’t okay that I didn’t go talk to them. I apologized, hey, because it does suck to see that even if I don’t know how they found that post or my account. I validated their hurt feelings on that. I tried eco explaining that I was extremely hurt because of how I was treated, and this is when I was ready to come talk about what happened and my feelings about it. I just kept being told that it’s not okay that I went behind their back and I should have talked to them about my feelings first...even though there were several reasons why I didn’t talk immediately. I was being ostracized because I hurt all of their feelings over a vent post and this person was insistent that I was in the wrong. I kept trying to explain why I was so hurt and wanted to seek anonymous support, they weren’t sorry. They said “I don’t care what people think about my sexuality” and “impact trumps intent” even though...I could argue the same thing. 

Finally after years of abuse I was confident in my own feelings, and in a mature way I said, “I feel gaslit.” I was called manipulative...it was all my fault. 

Out of these examples and many more...I’ve never once been apologized to. No one has ever taken responsibility for the way they made me feel. I’m a reasonable person and I’m open to being told when I’m wrong, when I’ve hurt someone, when I’ve made a mistake. I always apologize. I always validate their feelings. I always say I understand they’re hurt by their reasoning of why I made them upset. 

But I’m never apologized to. 

Years of gaslighting has ruined my brain. I’ll never be wronged. No matter what. My brain will always accept that I did something wrong - even if the truth is, I really didn’t. My brain will always find a way to accept that I did the hurting, I don’t deserve to be apologized to, I don’t deserve to have hurt feelings because I did something wrong and it’s my fault, my brain going back and forth and back and forth with itself. 

It will always fucking be my fault somehow, no matter what, and that is never going to change in my mind regardless of how hard I try to accept myself. It’s cracked for others to tell me their mistakes are mine. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to think straight again.

Sorry this post is so fucking long and that I’m just complaining. I feel so conflicted with myself. I’m scared and I don’t feel like I have anywhere to go. I hardly feel safe in this sub but I’m so desperate...so you for reading if you made it to the end.

fdsdn9,Use of Drones for assistance,"So obviously we all know how much money the military has and al ltheir fancy gadgets right? What kind of technology they have seen surpassed shared with the public and his from the public. But there's one thing we are all familiar with, DRONES.
Guy's, there's been a history of pandemics or viruses from Spanish flu, SARS fast forward Ebola and corona virus.
I have seen countless videos of nurses and do ores putting forth their bravery and life on the line to aid in the emergency state of this situation. My brother anyways got this drone thing for like his bday and I gotta say I was impressed, same with one of my friends who shot a whole music video with a God damn drone. But why thy fuck aren't we using this technology to help our medical global staff? There is only so much a doctor or nurse can handle in the midst of an outbreak like this, whilst keeping their mentality strong. Drones would be perfect if not preventing more outbreaks weighing out outcomes and statistically delivering more than just medical supplies and prescriptions. I'm talking more oxygen tanks, information capturing footage maybe we havr to wait decades before they surpass this law. But seriously? We have phones games and all this shit. But no drone in the middle of this virus? How many more viruses have to occur and bill gates presentations and conspiracies before we pass or they pass a law stating ""Drones activated to aid in pandemic crisis""? Like common. I hate the higher up's it's just pathetic they use this technology for spying purposes and not fucking help humans.",scienceiscool678,2020-03-05 00:37:01,0,280,58.73,66.59,14.47,15.69,16.47,19.29,81.43,48.21,12.86,8.21,2.5,2.5,0.36,0.71,2.14,4.64,5,11.79,6.43,5,8.93,1.43,12.14,5.71,4.64,1.79,0.71,3.93,4.29,1.79,2.5,0,1.79,0.36,11.07,0.36,0.71,0,1.43,11.07,0.71,3.21,0.71,2.14,1.79,4.29,2.5,1.43,1.07,0,4.29,0.36,2.86,0.71,0.36,10.36,4.64,1.07,3.93,1.43,0.71,2.14,8.93,0.36,8.57,2.14,4.29,2.86,2.14,1.43,0.36,0.71,0.36,0,2.5,1.43,0.71,0,0,0.36,11.07,3.93,2.14,0,0,1.79,0,0,0.71,2.5,0,0

fgxnoz,Simple advice that can reduce your risk of mortality from COVID 19,"I received this from a friend

The new NCP coronavirus/COVID 19 may not show sign of infection for many days, how can one know if he/she is infected. By the time they have fever and/or cough and goes to the hospital, the lungs are usually 50 % Fibrosis and it's too late! Experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning:

Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you complete it successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stuffiness or tightness, etc.,it proves there is no fibrosis in the lungs, basically indicating no infection. We are in critical times, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air.

 Also everyone should ensure your mouth and throat are moist, never DRY. Take a few sips of water every 15 mins at least. WHY?  Even if the virus gets into your mouth...drinking water or other liquids will WASH them down through your esophagus into the stomach. Once there in tummy...your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly....the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS which is very dangerous.

I was just gonna be in the bush, be relaxed. Since Im only 18, this trip was kind of a part of my identity.

Its a big country with a small population. We have 500 cases and 1 death. In my town we have 2 cases, both came home from a trip in the Italian alps. I know I am also privalged to live in a city with such few cases and not in Stockholm. However, my town is only 2 hours from Stockholm.

fhicj0,How do you dodge the flu?,"Whoever reads this try not to get alarmed when you see major spikes in the numbers of cases. That represents the number of tests that are being performed and reported. The reality is it can't be contained but it can be prevented. You just have to play the game of Dodge the Flu. What does that mean in your lifestyle? You have to define that. You may have to play this game for the next 1-2 years so get in and start as soon as possible. Really anyone who can work from home, should. Schools and all major gathering should stop.   


Everyone take a breath and get comfortable. We need supply chains to keep running and we need commerce to continue. There will be people who lose their jobs and businesses that will be forced to close. New jobs will open. More deliveries will have to happen. Sanitizing teams will be needed more law enforcement will be needed. Look for work there. We have the greatest communication tool ever - the internet. We should already have the infrastructure in place to adjust to a no-covid lifestyle. Amazon, grocery stores etc. are all ready to deliver. Other business just have to adjust. Let's get the delivery people some suits and training and get to living a new life style. Unfortunately we have to reduce human to human interaction but that's what it will take. We can do it for the next couple of years or when a virus is found.   


If we keep commerce going and we adjust our lifestyles as a country we should be fine. This will be bigger than 9/11.  Let's keep our country strong and adjust to this threat. Expect more like this in the future if we allow it to cripple us to much as a country. This could be viewed as a biological attack and this country is under attack. Adjust your lifestyles, keep contributing to the economy in some way and let's get back to business.

fhu2ej,Need some advice about work,"Hi,

So today at work someone came in talking about how they weren‚Äôt feeling well, we jokingly went over the symptoms of covid and she said she had a fever, cough and sore throat.
I said she should go home because I didn‚Äôt wanna get sick. She stayed at work coughing a few times and wandering around the office, so, I sent a message to the manager asking him to send a message to everyone saying not to come in if they‚Äôre sick, he said something along the lines of wash your hands and don‚Äôt touch your face so you don‚Äôt get sick.

About two hours later, I overheard her talking to other staff about covid so I said ‚Äúcan you please go get tested‚Äù then went on about why she should, I can‚Äôt get sick because I live with people who work with old people.
About 30 minutes later I got a message from my boss saying I can‚Äôt direct coworkers about their health.

Am I living in bizzaroworld or am I tripping out?
I feel like I did the right thing and someone needed to say something. I‚Äôll prolly get disciplined  for it.

How many people will require critical medical care and associated care-givers, personal protection equipment sets, beds, ventilators, etc. for a quickly widespread infection in the USA?  I've read articles discussing challenges with the statistics - under-reported infection, over-reported mortality.  Please suggest some simple math for imaginary worst-case estimates so we can move on to discussing how we could possibly address that need at-scale.   I'd be grateful for better numbers than below.  These look like we'll need stadium parking lots full of field hospitals.

*  350M residents \* 10% infection rate at a peak point in time \* 10% requiring critical care with isolation = 3.5M beds, and the associated care-givers with PPE
* \* 10% requiring ventilators = 350K ventilators

fimkau,Covid-19 Treatment Brainstorming,"The reason for this post is to be an inspiration for scientists to find a suitable treatment for this disease. So, if you have suffered from this disease and cured yourself, by methods known only to you and not only, please post your treatment methods on this blog/post.

But, please keep in mind that this blog does not take the place of a specialized and professional opinion. Please always ask for medical advice before putting into practice the things read here.

As for my personal experience with this Virus is as following:

I think thay around 3 or 4 weeks ago, I've got infected with it. I think it was Covid-19, because I had difficulty brething, whenever I was going up the stairs or walking a bit faster. I could only sleep on a side, because if I was sleeping on my back, I couldn't breath normally. I had a dry cough and fever. I felt the cough had something to do with my lungs. I felt them infected...
As I though it was just a bad flu, I started to take Augumentin 800 mg - Tablets. I took 2 tablets every night and 1 tablet every 6 hours. I took that much so that I could deliver an Antibiotic/Antiviral shock to my organism...
As I have Asthma as well, I consumed loads of Ventolin Inhaler so that I could breath more easily...
It took around 1 week and a half to recover from this condition. Now I am in perfect health...

I personally think I took the Covid-19 Virus, either from an Italian guy from Milan that sneezed in my face, either from an Irish guy that traveled in Italy and had a flu when I was speaking with him.

I don't suffer from any other illnesses besides Asthma and I do a lot of sport.

So yes...!!! This is how I recovered from what I think it was Covid-19 virus...

I said ""I think"", because I am not 100% sure it wasn't just a bad flu...I had as well a Anti Flu Vaccine at the end of the Autum, so I assume I should have been protected....

If you did  experienced the Covid-19 Virus and recovered, please do not hesitate to tell the world how you managed to recover.
It would be stupid to know the cure and not share it with the world.

P.S. 

DO NOT FORGET!!!!

ASK YOU DOCTOR FOR ADVICE BEFORE PUTTING IN PRACTICE WHAT YOU READ IN HERE.

fipexi,end of the world,"The start of the end is an interesting time because we get to see people‚Äôs reactions to things out of their control. People obviously know, inevitably one day the world will end. Whether they predicted a devastating storm or the sun burning out, none of us could possibly fathom such happening because it‚Äôs never happened before. Most people think, when the end comes, it comes; we will die and that is it. 
However, this doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case.
The end won‚Äôt just be ‚Äúthe end‚Äù. It won‚Äôt be quick or painless. Things roll downhill before they finally crash. This makes many think of The Bible and the words written for us that most seem to ignore. Holy or unholy, it‚Äôs hard to not consider religious aspects and previous clues as to how or when the end is coming. Maybe the end is in fact, a period of time. And maybe right now, we are in the beginning of the end. 

‚ÄúAnd there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the waves, people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming on the world. For the powers of the heavens will be shaken.‚Äú - Luke 21:25-26

Take a look around you. The madness, the fear and the selfishness of humanity. Look at how far we‚Äôve come but how far we‚Äôve strayed from our morals, our ethics. Above, may be a Bible verse but it doesn‚Äôt have to stand for how we see God, if we perceive one at all. It can be a bit of guidance on how to behave as a human being and how to treat others. It may be those very passages that make us reflect on our behavior and question if we have been completely stripped of humanity. 

Let‚Äôs discuss TODAY. 2020. 

The coronavirus is not the END. 

The virus will not kill us off. 

COVID 19 cannot wipe us out. 

We will not die. Although older generations may suffer, and be nearly existent if it continues to spread; We will still not be wiped out.

There will be vaccinations, there might be a cure. I believe very strongly in medicine and healthcare, and it can go a long way. Most people will recover. It‚Äôs not untreatable. This is not the problem. 

I work in a supermarket.There &amp; there only, is when I saw firsthand 
the beginning of the end.

After the outbreak and constant new cases where I live, people began to stockpile. Buying packages and packages of toilet paper, paper towels, lysol, disinfects. Food, bread, frozen food and meats. Over the last three weeks I have not been able to leave at my scheduled time because they needed the help so desperately.
Slowly, more and more people began to go mad. Now, today, we are considering shutting it all down. We are a 24 hour supermarket and we were forced to close at 10pm last night because we have no product. And we do not know when we will be properly restocked. 
 I supervise my department in which we deliver groceries and we could not fulfill our orders at 10pm, maybe having a quarter of an order left with the rest completely out of stock. (And these were for people who were originally supposed to get their food at 1pm). Most people did not even get their orders and were told we don‚Äôt know how or when they would get their food because we don‚Äôt have any left.

People were mean and people were rude. People were not understanding. I will say I have encountered people that had compassion, and I also have a way with talking to people. But most were angry, and most of all they were selfish. Out of almost 300 orders, some from the day prior who were STILL waiting, people strongly believed they were the MOST important. It‚Äôs like people forget they are not the only person who needs food. It‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt care that other people are going through the same thing. It‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt realize, I, myself, am a person too, rundown and scared of getting sick to eventually pass it on to others, working to try to help THEM. I am supposed to get out at 9pm, I left at 1:30 AM. (We only finished up until 1pm orders, and we had over 100 more). 

At this rate, we will run out of food.
We will run out of stock and we will be unable to replenish fully. The doors opened at 10 am the next morning and there were lines wrapped around the store waiting to go in and continue to wipe out the rest of whatever was left. 

People are not focusing on sanitizing or not passing off the disease, they are worried about themselves and stockpiling incase they are unable to leave the house, which is the next step. 

This will not stop. This will be a vicious cycle. Containing the disease is really the end to all of this, so we can see who is ill, at risk and who is a carrier. We need it to stop spreading, we do not need 30 packs of toilet paper. 

If it continues to spread, people will go crazy. This is a pandemic. This isn‚Äôt the flu. It is not deadly to most, but the economy will suffer dramatically, and although we will not all die, it will be the end of civilization as we know it.

They are banning the arrests of misdemeanors out of fear of spreading the virus in jails. Crime rate will go up. Stores will close, and people will break in and steal. People‚Äôs morals will deplete altogether (and we know there‚Äôs not much left) and it will become a world of terror. It will become out of control and there will be a shortage of workers the more people begin to grow ill (deadly or not.)

Healthcare workers will eventually be burnt out (as they are humans too). And nobody will be able to live a normal life in fear they will get ill or get someone else ill.  Healthcare and the resources we need to keep these medical facilities running, will be vanished. Then what? Doctors, nurses and other medical professional will become ill or burnt out. We will not have the space or the supplies to keep going. People will continue to get sick. (There are 7 billion people in the world). 

We will become solely dependent on the government. If there is no food left, everybody is sick and the world is going out of control we will be locked in our homes. Longer then we expected. The government will be forced to give us food and we will be living in an entire different world than we once will. We will one day regret the madness and reminisce on the days we were able to go about and buy food for ourselves. We will miss working, we will miss leaving the house. Schooling will be put on hold and we will try our best to do things ‚Äúonline‚Äù but it will consist of trial and error and many things will be put on hold until we finally adapt to living in these new conditions. We will destroy businesses, we will destroy the economy. People will stop working, money will be scarce and with everything closed down or out of business, it will be hard to replenish. This will be the downfall of us all. 

It will take a while to restore life as we know it because of the global scale it‚Äôs reaching and all the damage WE are doing it, by ignoring the warnings, listening to regulations and either taking to extremes (stockpiling so nobody else can have) or not taking it seriously enough (hygiene, preventing contagion ) 

The entire world is affected and currently going through the same thing. We only have so much supplies, eventually we will run out. Eventually we will fight for it. This can lead to eventually and inevitably, war between nations. We will run out of and soon fight for resources. If people of those nations, believe they are not properly being taken care of, people will rise up and fight against the government. COVID19 Is a bigger problem then your average ‚Äúflu‚Äù. 

When shit really hits the fan, we see how strong we are as people. Society‚Äôs true colors show, our humanity is unraveling and the WORLD‚Äôs true colors are showing. We are not for each other, we are for ourselves. The virus will not kill us. We will kill us.",clxirvoyant,2020-03-14 13:58:26,1,1455,42.94,77.1,57.48,4.01,14.26,14.98,90.65,59.24,13.06,7.7,1.03,5.22,0.14,0,1.31,5.36,6.8,12.99,13.88,4.88,8.52,2.89,21.72,3.78,2.27,1.79,1.37,2.27,4.05,0.89,3.09,0.76,0.96,0.41,10.72,0,0,0,0,12.16,1.72,1.79,1.24,3.16,1.44,4.67,1.37,0.76,0.14,0.41,2.68,0.07,1.79,0,0.82,10.65,5.43,1.17,2.89,1.17,0.55,2.89,13.26,5.64,15.95,2.54,7.15,6.25,2.06,0.14,0.27,0.62,0.55,0.48,0.07,0.07,0,0,0,0,15.46,6.94,4.6,0.14,0.21,0.07,0,0.14,0.55,1.65,1.1,0.07

The loose fibers of toilet paper is the perfect structure for capturing and preserving the virus.  Experts recommend not buying any toilet paper for the next month as in-shelf stocks and new deliveries have a high chance of being contaminated.

&amp;#x200B;

The coronavirus infects people through orifices like the mouth, the eyes, and the anus, which is why health officials say not to touch these parts before washing your hands.  The anus is particularly vulnerable to the cornovirus as it's basically an open tract to your internal organs.  This makes toilet paper a very effective way of spreading the virus.

&amp;#x200B;

[Clever title, ""CleanWorld""]

A (Mobile/Website) RPG that connects real world items/actions correlateing to in-game elements and events.  Lvl ranking attributed to completing incremental tasks to decontaminate, sterilize and maintain clean rooms from bedroom&gt;house/apt&gt;building&gt;work/office/shop/base.  Locations are IRL ala Foursquare, with badges and Pokemon Go style AR of ""clean"" vs world and other creative possibilities that incentivize daily/active routine to maintain cleanliness rating.  Items have qualities dependant on brand/type/concentration/sterilization efficiency/availability/combination/consistency.  

Game style to be determined, simpler, iconic (Fallout, BioShock) GUI/font design should not too dystopic, and maintain professional accuracy, credibility of all information relevant to appropriate level of sanitation standards. 


Rough ideas below:

Items (such as, not limited to)
 --PPE--
 -Disposable gloves
 -Face mask&lt;goggles&lt;shield&lt;respirator (N95&lt;)
 -Aprons&lt;Gowns&lt;Hoods&lt;Suits
 -Boot coverings
 
--Cleaners--
 -Disinfectants (sprays, bulk/portable, %/vol)
 -Sanitizers/Soaps/Wipes
 -Single use/packs

Consumables:
-First Aid
-Cough drops
-Tea/Coffee/Energy
-etc.

Ex.
 - Disinfectants (Cleaning products, sprays, sanitizers, detergents/soaps) rank from most effective/skin-safe to caustics, acids

 - Clean room (Lvl1) - basic cleaning/sterilization of major surfaces, (L2)floor, walls &amp; celling, (L3) air, filter &amp; circulate (L4)seal doors/windows (L5) sustainable/renewable energy

 - Sealed clean rooms/buildings must have an ""airlock"" to outside to be considered maintained clean, as clean rooms re-exposed to contaminated air lose status.  (NYC style wind/cold door shelter)

---

Character stats
Lvl/HP corresponds to weight/height, age=lvl, HP=condition, preexisting, physicality, 

Avatar may not be required to be accurate to real life, but encourage as to accurately assess other affected RPG elements, interactions.

fkcdrc,Herd Immunity in the US,"Let's say that we only need to get to 50% herd immunity to finish social distancing. And that only 2 out of 50 people who contract the virus need hospitalization (including those who have no symptoms and whose immune system quickly destroys the virus.)  And that the US has 50,000 dedicated icu beds for COVID patients (we don't have that many total). And that the hospitilization time is only a tad over 2 weeks so that a bed can have 25 patients a year. That means we could process 1.25 million COVID hospital patients a year and that 31.5 million people could get infected per year. If social distancing and such is able to give us exactly 50,000 patients every 2 weeks to perfectly flatten the curve...it will take over 5 years for half our population to have gone through COVID-19 and to achieve 50% immunity. 

Affordable anti-viral drugs, a lower hospitalization rate, or more icu beds would change this and a widespread vaccine would give us herd immunity in as fast as they could produce the shots. But life isn't going back to normal in a month or two.",Oyd9ydo6do6xo6x,2020-03-17 13:24:46,2,200,67.74,85.32,4.8,18.41,22.22,17,79,47,12,5,0,4.5,0,0,0.5,7,7,10.5,8,3,7.5,1.5,14,3.5,2,1.5,9.5,2,1.5,0.5,1,0,0.5,0.5,10,0,0,0,0,9.5,0.5,1,4,1.5,2,2.5,0.5,0,0.5,0,7,0,7,0,0,10.5,5.5,1.5,2,2.5,0,0.5,10,1,12,2.5,5,6,1,0,1.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13,5.5,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,1.5,2,1

fkrrbk,i have a theory that may slow covid 19 i am not a doctor nor do i have any medical background,"# [anti covid 19 theory](https://www.perfectfuturetheories.com/blog/anti-covid-19-theory)

it has been shown on some sites that the chance to catch corona virus with high temperature and high humidity environment is lower then in a regular  environment.

in some i believe studies from other sources the death rate moved from 4.5 to 0.3 based on region

i theories that the warmer weather in certain regions is the reason for the change 

freezing areas where also shown to have less of an infection rate (not to be confused with death rate) but i believe it is because of the fact that the population there stays in their house and so the plague isn‚Äôt transmitted to others in those regions.     

so i propose to make the weather  warmer by using an air conditioner to heat the environment until you don‚Äôt feel cold i recommend 24-26 c or 75.20000¬∞F- 78.80000¬∞F (but i am no expert i am just a theory person) and reduce your chance to get infected or if you are infected reduce the  chance for the infection to kill you

if you want to get the deluxe treatment add a humidifier to your house to reduce infection chance further however if you don‚Äôt have one i believe an air conditioner may help 

one word of warning if you don‚Äôt have an air conditioner and what heats your house may also burn it please check google if there is a danger of it starting a fire and if it does have that danger use warm clothing instead even tho this has no  backing  believe keeping your body warm is the key to surviving and reduce infection chance of covid 19 and if your house catches fire it will take time to put it out and you may die from the fire or from losing your house in the middle of this virus

one final note if you know someone who is infected with the virus and in a hospital try and convince them to turn the air conditioning to warmer or at least not cooling 

i know from reading online the virus causes breathing problems and fever and heat also causes those problems but the virus also infects less in a warm environment and i suspect strongly has a reduced chance to kill in a warm environment so to maximize survival chance if you know someone at a hospital with breathing problems try set the air conditioner to 20c (Celsius) or 68.00000¬∞F warming

but i understand if the doctors object since a high temperature may increase the breathing problems of the disease the ideal solution is to increase heat to 20c or 68F and let those who cant breath in the heat be attached to an oxygen mask but no doctor will force an oxygen mask on a theory like this   

again don‚Äôt over do it if it is too warm the heat may kill you

i am not a doctor i am merely a person who is good at connecting dots i have no medical training what so ever

Feel free to add more!! I‚Äôm talking more than just ‚Äúdoing dishes and going through old clothes‚Äù

1)Take down the curtains and wash them

2)Roll big rugs and sweep under

3)Scrub your dirty shoes! I‚Äôm a server and my work shoes were filthy

4)Dust ceiling fans

5)Take down and clean out the bathroom vent
6)Sanitize yoga mat

7)Wash your backpack! (The water was damn near black and my bag didnt even look dirty)

8)Wipe the dust off indoor plants

9)Vacuum the couch cushions

10) Wash ALL bedding-pillows, bed skirt, all of it! 
11) Deep clean makeup brushes and wash out the bag you keep your makeup in

12) Wipe down the insides of the fridge- throw out all the old stuff while youre at it!

13)Go through your pantry- check the expiration dates of things you know have been in there for a hot minute

14) *DUST!* Window panels, high rise ceilings, whatever. My portable space heater had dust caked on the vent!

15) Clean out that sock and underwear drawer- it‚Äôs time to let some of that go

16) Deep clean the inside of your car! Sanitize the dashboard as well

17) Wash your hairbrush- sounds dumb but actually lay your brush in a bowel of soap and water and hand scrub those those bristles! Use an old toothbrush if you have one.

18) Remove lighting fixtures and get those dead bugs out

Wearing a mask does not prevent the infection, but it is very effective for those who can.

This is because it is possible to control the infection from the mouth of infected people.

This is a Japanese video, but very easy. please do not worry.

The required materials are kitchen paper, elastic cord and double-sided adhesive tape.

I thought: 
- Vaccines. Once you obtain it, it's a good solution, but it could take a long time. 
- Closing all borders until all countries recover. It should work if strictly enforced, but bad for the economy and foreign relations. 
- More immunization. People could voluntarily get infected, but if millions do it, some people are likely going to die. Also, if many get severly ill there won't be enough hospitals. Specially because infecting just a small amount of people would take a long time. It would mean people would have to sacrifice for the greater good.

flkgrl,Just a question?,"So, I'm in the US in a state that just started having cases pop up. I recently went to the doctor this week for a cough, fever, runny nose, the whole shbang, but my doctor ended up just giving me the diagnosis of the flu and didn't test me for the virus (which is fine by me, I don't THINK I have it?)

Called out of work for the last couple days, I work at a general store. It's been slammed as you can imagine due to the panic buyers and what not.

My cough has gotten worse, my throat is pretty fucked up from it. Doctor gave it the okay even though I'm tasting blood from coughing so hard, so whatever. My concern is, should I be going back to work coughing like this? I was placed in the ""sick area"" with plenty of other patients when waiting for my appt the day I went in to see my doctor and they were all coughing up their lungs and who knows what they were carrying. This was two days ago. I'm worried to be working in the public while I'm sounding the way I am and I'm not sure exactly what I should do? My doctor told me I'm free to go back once my fever is clear for the flu and I'm getting mixed understandings of this self quarantine business. On the other hand I literally just started this job this week and I've worked one shift so I don't want this to look bad on me? Anxiety.

Sorry if this is stupid or should be obvious, I have no idea what I should be doing here.

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen what‚Äôs going on with states on lockdown. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt mind staying at home for two weeks, but here‚Äôs the problem...


I‚Äôm currently out of state right now living at a house in my college town. Because of all the chaos, I‚Äôm ending my lease early on April 1st instead of in July &amp; moving back home. Can anyone please give me some peace of mind as to how that‚Äôs going to go over?? I‚Äôm worried sick that I‚Äôll be quarantined to this house with no income, and a new roomate heading in to take over my lease. 

What if my state goes on lockdown?? Will they allow me to move? If I could go tomorrow I would but my mom JUST bought our new house, and the plumbing/electrical work won‚Äôt be finished until next week. Obviously we can‚Äôt move into a house with no basic essentials.

fm69kq,Ashley Furniture Distribution Center Unethical Practices,"I tried letting news outlets know about this incident but I have yet to get any response about this so I thought I would share this piece here with y'all. 

Here is a general idea of how the Ashley Home Furniture Distribution Center is taking their approach to the recent COVID-19 Outbreak. The distribution center, located by Canyon High School in New Braunfels, has over the past several months made crippling decisions to employees such as decreasing call center wages by several dollar amounts, decreased vacation time, increase the cost of insurance, etc. While these have shown the approach they take towards saving the company money, the true reveal of their morals came when COVID-19 became a pandemic and started limiting different businesses. While they have looked for ways to have call center employees work from home, the option was thrown out the window after software couldn't operate at home desktops and instead have them continue to work in a cramped work center. Some businesses continue to operate during this time, however the next part really makes no sense and is very ANTI-employee. If said worker was to contract COVID-19, they are being punished for staying home and will be hit with a strike towards attendance. Eventually enough strikes lead to termination. So while we are informed to stay home if we're sick, the distribution center wishes to punish you for being sick and risk your job. So do you still attend work and risk spreading if by some bad luck you have COVID? Or do you stay home and risk losing your job? Thats the decision they are forcing them to make. On top of this, they have forced every employee to sign an acknowledgement that keeps them from talking about COVID-19 and how the company approaches it. Many people in the call center are sick now (Unconfirmed if they are COVID positive or not) and employees are scared to come in. Management is putting their employees at high risk of exposure to the virus and keeping them quiet about it. Gamestop may be getting shit for staying open here, but these people are going to be 100% exposed if nothing is done about this soon.",darshei,2020-03-20 17:43:15,3,378,64.17,70.18,54.6,3.31,22.24,21.16,87.83,49.47,10.05,6.88,1.06,0.53,1.85,0,3.44,3.17,5.56,13.23,9.26,6.35,7.94,1.06,17.46,4.5,1.32,0.79,1.32,2.65,4.5,1.06,3.44,1.32,0.79,0.26,8.99,0,0,0,0,11.9,2.65,2.12,2.12,3.44,1.06,3.7,1.32,0.53,0.53,0,1.85,0.26,1.59,0,0,11.11,1.06,2.91,4.23,2.38,1.59,3.44,12.43,1.59,16.4,3.97,7.41,6.08,6.61,0.53,2.38,2.12,0.26,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,10.32,3.7,3.17,0,0,0.53,0,1.32,0,0.79,0.53,0.26

fmhwdr,Hard facts: Drug affinities for Covid-19 - what works and what not. AMA,"""In    the field of molecular modeling, docking is a method which predicts   the  preferred orientation of one molecule to a second when bound to   each  other to form a stable complex.""

I    have docked several ligands (drugs) which are touted to work as  ""cure""   or ""treatment"" of the Covid-19 to couple of the proteins  related to   covid-19. Anyone can verify these results I present. I can  share the   docking parameters as well if one needs them.

Preparation of the ligands and proteins is done according to the art.

If    you want me to run simulations for particular compound to these    proteins, just ask and I'll do it and post the results here. I am    willing to run the simulations to other proteins as well if you will    provide the information needed (PDBid and the site of binding. If not,    I'll just do blind docking for the prepared protein).

For    the results, more negative Gibbs free energy, the merrier binding and    efficacy of the drugs. Results ranging from -7 kcal/mol to -15  kcal/mol   are relevant. F.ex. -15 kcal/mol is highly active (and  probably quite   selective as well). Anything from -6.9 to 0 kcal/mol  can be discarded.   They might work for something else though. From this  info you can  deduce  yourself what drug/ligand works and what not  (check the ADME(t))  - at  least to that particular protein.  Unfortunately I cannot dock   (colloidal) silver... Which I do make and  ingest myself (for other   reasons). So please, stop the gossiping and  guessing.

PDBid: 6LU7  (COVID-19 main protease):

Allicin:  -3.4 kcal/mol

Alliin:  -4.3 kcal/mol

Azhitromycin:  -6.4 kcal/mol

Chloroquine:  -6.1 kcal/mol

Curcumin:  -6.8 kcal/mol

GS-441524:  -6.5 kcal/mol

Hydrogen peroxide:  -2.9 kcal/mol  (it could work, if it destroys the protein by oxidation!)

Hydroxychloroquine:  -5.8 kcal/mol

Oseltamivir:  -6.3  kcal/mol

Ricinoleic\_acid:  -4.4 kcal/mol

Scopolamine:  -7.2  kcal/mol

Sulforaphane:  -3.7 kcal/mol

Vitamin-C:  -5.2 kcal/mol (if it works, it works by massive dosages generating hydrogen peroxide)

(Based    on these results, scopolamine binds the most tightly to the main    protease. It doesn't mean that it renders the protein inactive though!    Curcumin seems to work as well but it requires to consume black pepper    (piperine) as well!.

PDBid: 6VSB (2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein):

Allicin:  -4.0 kcal/mol

Alliin:  -4.7 kcal/mol

Azhitromycin:  -7.7 kcal/mol

Chloroquine:  -6.1 kcal/mol

Curcumin:  -7.6 kcal/mol

GS-441524:  -7.1 kcal/mol

Hydrogen peroxide:  -3.4 kcal/mol (it could work, if it destroys the protein by oxidation!)

Hydroxychloroquine:  -6.4 kcal/mol

Oseltamivir:  -6.5 kcal/mol

Ricinoleic\_acid:  -5.6 kcal/mol

Scopolamine:  -7.3 kcal/mol

Sulforaphane:  -4.1 kcal/mol

Vitamin-C:  -5.6 kcal/mol (if it works, it works by massive dosages generating hydrogen peroxide)

Based    on these results, azhitromycin binds the best to the spike   glycoprotein  with curcumin almost on par. Hydroxychoroquine isn't   nearly as  effective.

As  you see,   for example curcumin has comparable affinities to synthesized  drugs   for the main protease and spike glycoprotein. And this is probably  the   reason India does not have so much of covid-19 cases due to the  curry   they eat.

And  the offtopic part:   Does someone know what is the antibody for this  particular covid   strain? I'm suspecting the ongoing tests can't  discriminate between   this covid from some other (harmless) coronavirus.  Hence so much   positives. If you have the info, please forward the DOI to  the article   or link to the protein...

I hope someone pins this thread or moves it to [r/Coronavirus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/),    otherwise it's like pearls before swine... My account is too fresh to    post anything to there. Anyway, I say: fuck the governments and   official  medical agencies and so called ""doctors"" who claim this and   that works  without publishing any hard facts to the public. Everybody   should do their own research and not allow lead themselves stray due to   laziness  to do some due diligence checking. And never trust the mass   media. I have the opinion the virus is most  definitely lab made. There   are no credible peer reviewed articles  stating otherwise and I have   read them all. The best one, full of crap  when you examine it thoroghly    ([dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0820-9))    - which every major politically inclined newspaper at least in  Finland   referred to - just poses some possibilities it could have  evolved in   nature - that's all. Instead there are loads of articles  describing   artificial mutations done for it. (f.ex one from 2008  describing how the   the HIV-inserts are introduced to bind to  ACE2-receptors. Such as [https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/82/4/1899.full.pdf](https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/82/4/1899.full.pdf)). They are fully disregarded and discredited. I wonder why? To cause massive panic and financial crisis apparently.

fmtpqy,"Do Not Send, Receive Blood Because It Can Contain The Seed Of Corona Virus NCOV &amp; Many Virus","**Do Not Send, Receive Blood Because It Can Contain The Seed Of Corona Virus NCOV &amp; Many Virus**

I guess it time to some divine level advice about health and corona virus NCOV, whether it going with or against any advice you saw in the media, authority channel does not matter, many people may not like it but some awakening smart people will benefit from it.

Blood is the most powerful and dangerous force by nature, it contact hundreds of different chemicals.

But you need to remember that most people die because they do not have oxygen, air, not because lack of blood.

The blood in human body is usually merge with harmful virus, bacteria so the body system can work better, including the new corona virus NCOV, SARS, Ebola, HIV, MERS, etc.

If you donate or send out your blood, which mean you are lower your defense system, have more risk of receive diseases, hamful dangerous virus will have more chance to survive and to grow.

While, when you receive in blood, your body system most likely will receive harmful dangerous virus from others for sure. And they also receive shock effect and in some case can cause instantly death.

The blood in many secret societies, groups was used for ritual, open secret gates, doors. etc. for whatever reason but most stupid purpose.

So I highly recommended all of you stop donating, send out or receive in any blood for your own health and other‚Äôs health as well.

Regard,

fmw2wm,Careless Corona,"We went into a grocery in the afternoon on Saturday.

He grabs a shopping trolley, does not wipe the handle  down with an amazingly  available sanitary wipe, much to my dismay.

We proceed to the nearby deli counter where he then rubs his eye and then orders food which he plans on eating whilst shopping.

We're in the store for less than 2 minutes at this point and in my mind it's already a nightmare infection situation.

I plead with him, saying that I wished he cared more, hoping he doesn't eat those snacks without washing his hands first.  He pushes the likely contaminated trolly away from the deli counter and before I can get another word out while digging into the bag with his dirty hand pulling out a snack and putting it into his mouth as I sigh a defeated sigh.  He has the nerve to offer me one of those snacks at this point.  Later in our shopping trip one of his snacks has a hair in it... I refrain from laughing while pointing out the closest garbage bin for him to toss it into.

I know this story may not be the best written at this point but you all get the gist.

On a normal day I am not fond of germs, today, my hands are so dry from so much more washing than usual.  I'm in near panic mode now.   I'm doing the best I can to protect myself but my efforts are being sabotaged.

Back in the day he was not scared of H1N1/flu, and then he got it.... And he was miserable.  He's gotten a flu shot every year since then... He's now not scared of COVID-19.... He's acting so careless he's likely to get it and to be honest it will be hard for me to feel sorry for him if he does get it.

I am so angry at him for being so careless.  I just don't even know what to do at this point. 

I can't talk to anyone about this as he does not care and my mum is worried about me dying from this even though I am not even 40 yet.  I am also scared about talking about this with others I know because I'm afraid they will think I'll infect them because of his carelessness.  He thinks I'm a germ Nazi when he has a cold... Just imagine if he gets Covid!  I just want to sleep in the caravan so I can better protect myself.",Covid-Shy-69,2020-03-22 00:31:14,3,425,38.12,39.78,41.85,5.6,16.35,11.29,90.82,61.88,21.41,15.76,7.29,0.94,0.24,6.82,0.47,5.65,5.88,15.76,9.41,5.88,7.53,2.59,16.71,6.59,3.06,0.94,1.41,1.88,6.59,2.35,4.24,1.65,0.24,0.94,10.12,0.24,0,0.24,6.82,8.47,1.65,0.71,1.18,1.65,0.47,4,2.82,0.24,0.47,2.12,4.94,1.65,1.41,0,1.88,5.65,0.94,1.65,1.41,2.35,0.71,2.12,12.71,2.35,14.82,1.18,7.76,6.12,0.47,0.71,0,0.94,0,0.24,0.47,0,0,0,0.47,0,14.12,8.47,1.65,0,0,0,0.24,0.24,0,3.29,0,0.24

fn0kwt,A friend of mine messaged me this:,"*A SENIOR CHINESE MILITARY INTELLIGENCE* *OFFICER WHO COULD NOT CONTAINED THE PAIN OF LOSING HIS* *ONLY CHILD, HAVE DECIDED TO REVEAL* *THE SECRET BEHIND THE DREADED VIRUS* *(CORONA ), COME WHAT MAY...............* 
I am a senior Chinese  military intelligence officer and I know the truth about the coronavirus outbreak. It is far worse than the media are telling you.
I am a Chinese citizen in Wuhan who occupies ‚Äî or perhaps occupied ‚Äî a high-ranking position in military intelligence. I am also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. As a senior official near the top of the Party, I have access to a great deal of classified information and I have been involved in many top secret government projects. I have a doctorate from a leading university in a western country, which is why I am able to write my account in English.

I have information that I believe could lead to the overthrow of my government. It is also relevant to billions of people outside of China, all of whom are now in existential peril.

It will not surprise you to hear that if my identity were to be revealed, my life would be in grave danger, as would those of my wife and son. I ask you to respect the fact that I have stripped out of this account all facts that would make it easy to identify me.

By now you will be familiar with the recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV, also known as NCP, or simply ""coronavirus"". You will have heard that it originated in Wuhan, an industrial city in China, and that it came from an animal ‚Äî most likely a bat or a pangolin ‚Äî that was sold in a wild animal market. You will have been told that it is an influenza-like illness that can in severe cases cause pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. Finally, you may have heard that although the disease is highly infectious, it is dangerous only to the elderly or to those who have a compromised immune system. The official lethality rate is approximately 2% or so.

All of that is a bunch of lies concocted by the Chinese state with the tacit support of the U.S. deep state and its friends in the European Union, Russia and Australia, and spread by the docile media in all of those countries.

Let me start by telling you that the world does not operate the way you think it does. Although countries like the US and China vie for global dominance, that competition is restricted to certain limited areas. In most ways, the two countries are more interested in cooperation so that they can stop other competing countries from gaining more power. They also have a shared interest in keeping real power out of the hands of their ""ordinary"" citizens. To this end, they have many different mechanisms by which they control the overwhelming majority of their media outlets. The Americans in particular have perfected the art of creating made-up ""divisions"" between their two main parties which are designed to hide the fact that both serve the same masters.

These same nations also posses technology that is far more advanced than you can imagine and which is kept carefully hidden from public view. This includes advanced artificial intelligence capable of undermining and deciding any election in the world; biological and chemical agents that can manipulate and control the thinking patterns and behaviours of citizens to terrifying degrees; highly sophisticated manipulation techniques using hypnotic practices entirely unknown to the public; and other things that I will not go into now. My point is that the great nations do not compete so much as work together. Their principal goal is to shield the true workings of the world from the ""uninitiated"" public.

Just to give you one example, there aren‚Äôt actually any nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. The U.S. and the Soviet Union scrapped them all in the 1970s, as did their client states. Everyone realised that those weapons could not be used without destroying the whole world, so there was no need for them; but by pretending that they still had them, the big players were able to keep the non-nuclear powers in line.

Let me return to the virus.

Last year, large-scale anti-government protests erupted in Hong Kong. The Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party considered these to be a grave threat to the integrity and stability of the motherland. The U.S. government and the EU both knew that the Chinese were secretly working on a biological agent that was supposed to make the protesters docile and obedient. Without going into detail, I worked on that project. We tried to develop a sort of spray that could be dispersed from helicopters or drones and that would lead to mental retardation and behavioural change.

Naturally, as Hong Kong is one of the most open and international cities in the world, the Party decided that it was too risky to release the agent in Hong Kong without first testing it. For this, it needed a great number of human guinea pigs. Two groups were identified for this.

First, we rounded up a large number of so-called ""islamic radicals"" in Xinjiang Province and took them to what we called ""training camps"". We had already been using these camps for human experimentation for several years, but the Hong Kong protests meant that we redoubled our efforts. We exposed the inmates to various ""alpha"" experimental agents. As these were odourless and invisible, the subjects were not aware that they were taking part in medical trials. The resulting high rates of cancer, premature dementia, suicidal depression and death by organ failure could easily be suppressed, as the camps are located in very remote parts of our motherland.

Once the initial experiments had yielded a ""beta"" agent, it was transported to Hubei Province, where it was deployed in a special military testing facility outside the city of Wuhan. This was not even a particularly well-kept secret: the existence of this facility has been reported in international news. Even the fact that it is located close to the wild animal market is a known fact.

By then our President had already introduced a ""social credit"" system that allowed us to identify disloyal, counter-revolutionary and bourgeois elements in our society. Using the social credit scores ‚Äî which are taken from online activity, electronic shopping behaviour and reports from informers in civil society ‚Äî we selected some of the worst offenders. These included human rights lawyers and activists, Christians, homosexuals, artists, intellectuals, people who speak foreign languages, and other undesirables.

Once these troublemakers had been collected and placed in the testing facility, we exposed them to the Agent, which is biochemical in nature and spread in an invisible aerosol, akin to certain viruses. Initial results were encouraging, as we saw significant cognitive decline and reduction in higher mental processing facilities. Essentially, our undesirables were becoming mildly mentally disabled, which is precisely the effect we wanted to produce in order to pacify the restive population of Hong Kong.

Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent that the Agent also had other effects. About one week after the retardation set in, our subjects developed major anxiety and panic attacks. Eventually they developed symptoms akin to those of paranoid schizophrenics. At that point, their bodies rapidly deteriorated. They developed massive internal bleeding; the walls of their arteries dissolved; they bled out of their eyes and orifices, and their tissue disintegrated.

To put it in a more direct Western manner, they started to melt.

Death usually occurred through multiple organ failure. This was preceded by at least five days of severe agony which could not be alleviated by painkillers. It was at this time that I first violated our protocol: one subject, an elderly lady who had published defamatory cartoons of our President, begged me for death with such insistence that I took pity and shot her. I was reprimanded, but fortunately the complaint was dropped when I agreed to reimburse the cost of the bullet. I swore to myself never again to show such unnecessary emotion.

We decided that our Agent was unusable. It was far too destructive for our purposes. We wanted the population of Hong Kong to submit to us; we did not want to exterminate it.

Naturally, our American friends had by then taken an interest in our work and asked us for a sample for their own research and testing purposes. They hinted that they wished to use it to resolve certain difficulties in Venezuela. Normally we would have agreed, as we maintain friendly relations with the CIA, but given the extremely toxic nature of the Agent, we declined.

This, as it turned out, was a grave mistake. The CIA was convinced that we had developed something very powerful and wanted to keep it to ourselves. They offered a great deal of money to one of our researchers. Foolishly, he agreed to sell them a specimen. We found out just in time for the handover and tried to stop it from happening. In the ensuing shoot-out ‚Äî don‚Äôt bother to look for it in the news, it was never reported anywhere ‚Äî several dozen people were killed.

More importantly, however, the Agent escaped.

The shoot-out took place at the wild animal market which has been reported as the location of the ""animal to human"" transmission that started the outbreak. But of course there was no such transmission; it was just the location where the CIA was supposed to receive the sealed vial containing the Agent. The vial shattered when it was dropped by the traitor who had agreed to sell it to the Americans.

By now I understand you will be sceptical. If I really am who I say I am, why would I be sharing this information on the internet? Let me assure you that I am no friend of the Western system of governance. I love my motherland and I am loyal to the Communist Party. It has lifted hundreds of millions of my compatriots out of squalor and poverty. However, I am also a human being and I have a conscience.

Most importantly, I have a wife and a son.

Once we realised that the Agent had escaped and would start to spread, we swiftly put all of Wuhan into lockdown. I was one of those tasked to manage the fallout of the contamination. Of course we could not keep such a huge undertaking secret, so we decided to order our state media to report that a ""coronavirus"" had broken out in Wuhan.

In reality, of course, there is no ""coronavirus"". It was all made up.

It was one of my colleagues who came up with the genius idea of pretending that people with the common flu suffered from the coronavirus. This allowed us to hide the true nature of the disease. Let me explain.

It is currently flu season in China. When we realised that we could no longer control the spread of the Agent, we sent our men to all the hospitals and instructed all doctors to diagnose every case of the common flu as ""coronavirus"". We came up with a new name ‚Äî 2019-nCoV ‚Äî and handed out ""factsheets"" that described a made-up illness.

The result of this decision was that tens of thousands of individuals who were simply suffering from a cold or flu were now diagnosed as having a mysterious coronavirus that, although infectious, was not often lethal. While this frightened the public, it allowed us to push the narrative that the disease was not that deadly; it also gave us time to prepare for the catastrophe that was sure to come by imposing a lockdown on Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province.

You have not heard this in the news ‚Äî and given the size of Wuhan, with its population of 11 million, it is not known even to many of the residents ‚Äî but within days thousands upon thousands were infected and before long they suffered the agonising deaths that I have already described. Within a week, there were so many corpses that we did not know what to do with them, so we ordered the surviving social credit prisoners to drive the bodies into the countryside and bury them in mass graves. But it was very difficult to keep this activity secret, and we could not even keep up as there were so many corpses. We planted a story that five million residents had ""fled"" Wuhan. In reality, of course, many of those people had died from the Agent.

I was working around the clock helping to orchestrate this cover-up. When I think back to my actions now, I feel great shame. At the time I still believed that I was fighting for my motherland and that the rule of the Party was right and just. But deep down, I had already begun to have doubts.

My faith in the Party was shaken even more deeply when I learnt what had happened to Dr Li Wenliang. He was one of the few doctors who refused falsely to diagnose flu patients with the ""coronavirus"". As a punishment, he was sent to help transport dead bodies to mass graves. The expectation was that he would be infected with the Agent and die an agonising death, but to our great surprise, he did not contract the illness.

You have of course read that he died of ""coronavirus"". You have been misinformed. A sergeant of the People‚Äôs Armed Police injected him with a mixture of heroin and mercury that caused his lungs to deflate.

When I found out about this I became unsure whether or not I was doing the right thing. While I believe that it is appropriate for a government to rule with a severe hand, I do not think that it was right to kill Dr Li. He was a compassionate and kind man and he cared about his patients; how can our motherland not benefit from having such a doctor?

I shared my concerns with my wife, but she convinced me that I should not say anything to my superiors. She said that it was too dangerous; that they valued loyalty above everything else; and that I would only find trouble if I admitted to my doubts about their practices. She also pointed out that we benefited from priority medical treatment. As senior officials, we received regular supplies of the highly-sophisticated hazmat masks that are the only known technology that can prevent infection. She implored me to think of our son, who is still small. If I spoke out and were caught, our lives would be at risk.

Around the same time, it became clear that the Agent was entirely beyond our control. It was spreading like wildfire throughout Hubei Province and beyond, infecting tens of millions and causing them all to die.

I understand that what I just said is difficult to believe, because you have been told that there have been only about 50,000 infections, and far fewer deaths. But these are the influenza infections that have been falsely passed off as the non-existent ""coronavirus"". The Agent is far, far more contagious than that, and its fatality rate, unlike the ""coronavirus"", is not 2%.

No, its fatality rate is 100%. Nobody recovers from it. Everybody who contracts it dies.

And a lot of people are contracting it.

Hubei Province lies in ruins. The various travel restrictions and lockdowns that have been imposed were not created to stop the spread of the Agent ‚Äî none of them can stop it, not embargoes, not face masks or hand sanitiser ‚Äî but to stop the survivors from seeing the catastrophe with their own eyes.

I am part of the greatest cover-up in human history: the hiding of the deaths of tens of millions. Very soon, Hubei Province will be no more than a giant mortuary, and the truth will come out.

For me, the turning point came when the Party told yet another lie, and that lie was too dreadful even for me to accept. You may have heard that China built a new hospital, called Huoshenshan Hospital, in Wuhan, in order to provide additional quarantine and isolation facilities for infected patients. You may have heard that they built it in only ten days.

That too is a lie.

Sure, they did build something in six days. But it was not a hospital. The true nature of the building was top secret. Initially, I was naive enough to believe that the Party was demonstrating its compassion and care for the people. But then my superiors sent me to Huoshenshan. I was shown around the installation by a military police officer called Corporal Meng (this is not his real name). It was there that I saw the truth.

As I have mentioned, the only way to protect oneself from the Agent is by wearing a special protective mask that is entirely unlike those available commercially. Even medical professionals do not have access to it. It is available only to biomedical warfare researchers and it contains extremely advanced technology.

These masks need to be kept at a particular temperature to offer full protection, and lose their effectiveness very quickly. As I have also already said, one of the benefits of my position was that both my family and I had access to regular supplies, which is why were safe when compared to civilians, doctors and even lower-level government officials, all of whom wore utterly ineffective surgical masks in the misguided belief that they would protect them.

And so, wearing this special equipment, I went to Huoshenshan with Corporal Meng.

Whatever you want to call that place, it is not a hospital. Sure, the entrance looks like a hospital and in the ward at the front of the complex, there are what appear to be normal medical beds. There, thousands of infected patients lie, all of them in the early stages of the disease. I walked along those long, white corridors next to Corporal Meng, his angular face dispassionate in his military fatigues, and saw hundreds upon hundreds of identical hospital beds on which squirmed the terrified and diseased inhabitants of Wuhan. Their cries and pleas haunt me in the long nights in which I now am unable to sleep.

But this was merely the beginning. Eventually the Corporal took me to the rear of this front section. There, locked metal gates led to what he called the ""middle section"". The patients in the front are unaware of its existence. It is there that the more advanced cases are kept, in what most closely resembles a mental asylum.

Immediately upon entering this part of Huoshenshan I was struck by the dim lighting and stench of vomit and human waste. Here the unfortunates roamed freely, their minds gradually disintegrating in endless panic attacks and psychotic episodes. Here too there were no more doctors, merely gorilla-faced men in black uniforms who belonged to some secret branch of the military police I had never heard of.

They appeared to have been selected for their cruelty, for they beat and degraded the patients in the most sadistic manner. Many of the inmates had regressed to childlike states and lay on the floor weeping like infants and begging for compassion that they did not receive. There was cruel pleasure in the eyes of these thugs as they brutalised the unfortunates. They beat them with batons, sprayed pepper spray into their eyes and kicked them with their steel-capped boots. As I was from military intelligence, the guards did not even attempt to hide their activities. They even invited me to join; in every way, they treated me as one of them.

Yes, one of them. I stood in the grey staff bathroom of Huoshenshan and looked into a cheap mirror and asked myself ‚Äî is this really what you are? Are you really like them?

But the violence was not merely an expression of sadism, for the poor inmates were not there to be cared for.

They were there to work.

There was one more set of doors, and beyond them lay what the Corporal called the ""Core"". And it was there that I saw it ‚Äî piles and piles of dead bodies, stacked on top of one another all the way to the ceiling. There were men, women and children, elderlies and toddlers, rich and poor, beautiful and misshapen, proud and humble.

They were all of them dead. Our Agent made no distinction between any of them.

I gasped when the Corporal led me to the Core. I cannot count how many there were, but it was many, many thousands. And in the midst of the piles of corpses was a kind of path, and I heard a roaring sound in the distance. The miserable patients from the middle section picked up the dead and carried and dragged them away into the dark, even as the guards beat them with truncheons.

It took me a little while before I grasped what was happening. I simply could not believe what lay at the end of that path in the Core.

It was an enormous furnace, with great fires roaring within.

One by one, their minds destroyed and their bodies twisted, the dying men and women carried the corpses to the furnace and cast them inside in a doomed attempt to hide the dreadful truth. I saw several of them collapse from exhaustion only for their lifeless bodies to be added to the mountains of corpses on both sides. In a seemingly endless line they went, their emaciated bodies clad in grey overalls, their backs bent under the weight of their dreadful cargo. Many howled and groaned in terror and their voices joined in a sorrowful cacophony that lingered over the roar of the fires.

In deep shock, I stared at the boundless horror before me. Beside me stood Corporal Meng, his freshly-shaved face as emotionless as before. When I turned to face him, he looked at me. His mouth smiled, but his eyes did not.

""We use the energy to operate Huoshenshan,"" he said. ""We save the state considerable resources in this way. And look,"" ‚Äî he waved at the gallery of the dead ‚Äî ""there are so many of them here. You could almost describe it as renewable energy."" He laughed and waved his hand in a strangely camp gesture.

I stood speechless and stared at the infernal scenes before me. Men in black uniforms screamed like daemons at the wretches who were disposing of the corpses for them. They stripped the dead of anything that had value ‚Äî jewellery, cash, expensive clothing ‚Äî and tossed these items onto an enormous pile next to the furnace. When I asked the Corporal what would be done with the items, they said that they would be used to pay for the ""healthcare expenses"" incurred by the patients‚Äô stay in Huoshenshan.

I vomited in the toilet. When I flushed and came out of the stall, Corporal Meng stood by the door and looked at me. His face was as blank as before, but in his eyes I thought I registered a very faint trace of contempt. You are ten years my senior, the look said, but you are soft.

I thanked him for his service and went home.

When I arrived, I saw that I had received hundreds of updates on the encrypted device the Party uses to communicate to insiders. The news were unimaginably grim. The State Legal and Economic Commission had allocated funds for the construction of dozens of facilities like Huoshenshan all throughout China. The Agent had spread not only to every single province of the motherland, but to most other nations in the world. Fortunately, we had agreements in place with other governments ‚Äî they agreed to pretend that the infections were due to a coronavirus. They were just as worried as we were that a panic might break out in their countries. The Americans in particular were terrified that the S&amp;P 500 might decline. This, they said, would be unacceptable in an election year, so we could count on their full support.

Of course the World Health Organisation also helped us. For a long time, the only issue with the WHO has been that we have been locked in a contest with the Americans about who bribes them more. They released all sorts of sophisticated misinformation about having decoded the DNA of the so-called coronavirus. All this has allowed us to stave off a global panic.

For now.

Yet the situation was worsening with astonishing speed. I am reluctant to reveal too much on this point, as it would make it too easy for my enemies to identify me, but we quickly began to implement measures to protect our most senior leaders. If you look at the world news, you will see that Xi Jinping, our President, disappeared for approximately one week after the outbreak, before being seen again with the leader of Cambodia.

You should know that the person who met the Cambodian leader was not President Xi. It was a body double who had, for many years, been trained to look and sound just like our President. President Xi is of course not careless enough to risk his own death. He is safely ensconced in a secret bunker underneath Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the Party in Beijing.

Nor was he the only leader who is in hiding. In fact, I can assure you that over half of all senior Party members are currently being imitated by trained actors who are following instructions given to them via special implants. Do you really think that our Prime Minister would risk his life by going to Wuhan?

All of this means that our government has become utterly paralysed and the functions of the state have been taken over by the military.

It became clear to me that our efforts were pointless. Yes, the lockdowns, travel bans and targeted assassinations of rebellious journalists allowed us to hide the true situation in Wuhan; but I knew that this would not last. Once the mass deaths begin in the rest of the world ‚Äî in our estimation, this should happen within the next week or so ‚Äî everyone will know the truth. It will become clear that we cannot protect ourselves from the Agent. Surgical masks, hand sanitiser, gloves ‚Äî nothing can stop it. Nothing except the special hazmat masks, but those cannot be produced in anything like sufficient quantities. You, an ordinary person, will never even receive one, let alone a sufficient number to see you through the coming holocaust.

For those of you reading this, therefore, all I can suggest is that you keep your loved ones close to you. Hug them, tell them what they mean to you. Enjoy the time you have left with them. It is not typical in Chinese culture to express one‚Äôs feelings in this way, but I have learnt the importance of such gestures.

I promised my wife that I would show this document to her before I posted it.

Yet I broke my word.

I hear her weep in loud, hoarse sobs in the bedroom, and the keyboard of my laptop is wet with my own tears. Not long ago, we received results of the regular tests that are part of our ""priority medical treatment"", and we learnt that my son had been infected with the Agent.

The military police that has supplied me with the special protective mask had been giving expired and ineffective masks to my son, masks that senior officials had already worn and then discarded when they ceased to protect them. My own masks, on the other hand, had always been of the necessary quality.

I suppose they decided that my son was of lower priority than me. I suppose my son could not help them with their cover-up.

We had long ago decided that we would be different ‚Äî we would be honest with him, always. And so when he asked us, we told him the truth. We told him that he was very sick. He asked more, and we told him he would not get better.

He continued asking, and we told him that he would die. He is very small, but he was old enough to understand.

His terrified wails will haunt me for the rest of my miserable days in this world.

Let them come. Let them do with me as they will.

Its true that the economy and people will suffer financial upheaval, but I wonder how scared the billionaires are right now? Are they worried that they could end up like the rest of us?

""Aides say Trump is itching for the guidelines to be eased at the end of the 15-day period, but realistically there are few health experts who think that's enough time to know whether the measures he announced last week will suffice. Trump and some of his top officials are growing more anxious with social distancing guidelines put in place to combat the coronavirus, sources close to the White House effort said. One senior official said the  President is losing patience with the period of national self-isolation  that has frozen the US economy.""

Trump claimed that the Food and Drug  Administration ""had approved the ""very powerful"" drug chloroquine to  treat the virus"". Shortly after the FDA released a statement that said this was not true and they had not even done clinical trials. But because Trump said this (from a position of power) people around the world took it seriously. In Nigeria, the price for that drug rose by 400%. Gee, nice profit for anyone invested in that drug...even if it is proven to not work next week...those investors will clean up in the meantime.  Even more sad are the reports of chloroquine poisoning because people believed that statement.

I then would pull a pen from my pocket for pushing the buttons, and tell them to tell their manager that this is something that really should be done. And don't use their pen to sign slips...use your own because you just don't know.

Same goes for ATM's, gas pumps, elevator buttons and anything with a keypad that is used 1,000,000 times a day.

fnwbq2,How I recovered from what may have been COVID-19,"On March 11th I got sick at work. At first it seemed like allergies to everyone else as out of nowhere my nose was runny, and I started sneezing quite a bit. I thought that might be the case, so I carried on with my usual responsibilities. As they day seemed to drag on, I felt increasingly worse just noting how tired I felt. So, the plan was to go to a Wednesday night service at Church, and then head home. When I got home, I ate and went straight to bed. The next morning, in one word, miserable. We were short staffed at my job, and I had no reason to believe that it wasn‚Äôt just a terrible cold. So, I forced my aching, feverish body that hurt everywhere to work. I was two hours late and left two hours early. But the next day, I called out sick out because I knew if there was a chance of whatever I had being serious, I didn‚Äôt want to spread it anymore than maybe I had already. 

I wanted to go to the doctor, but like so many others, I couldn‚Äôt afford it, especially since there would likely be no medicine to prescribe. By this time, it was Friday. The fever was gone, and my nose wasn‚Äôt running but stuffy; also, I had a dry cough. By Saturday, the cold was improving, but I started getting short of breath just while talking. However, by Sunday everything seemed to be getting back to normal. The stuffy nose was there, but the cough was dissipating, no shortness of breath, no fever, no aches, and just a lingering headache. I was ready for work Monday, but please hold your the angry/horrified reaction. My office was closed to the public, and all my co-workers stayed home with their children, except my supervisor who has a private office on site. So, I was still isolated. Now, it‚Äôs been just short of two weeks, and I‚Äôm completely better, except I can‚Äôt  smell anything. I can breathe through my nose just fine, but my sense of smell seems to be temporarily gone. 

So, what do I think worked for me? Well, before I got sick I had already started strict diet as my way of observing Lent. I‚Äôve been eating lots of vegetables and fruits, for example arugula, watercress, strawberries, etc. Also, I did take some medicine. I took Mucinex the second and third days when the symptoms were at their worst. Then, to combat the headaches, I took Tylenol but only twice. Other than that, I maintained my vegetable heavy diet with some chicken soup and hot tea added to the mix. Well, I‚Äôm on day 12, and I feel completely better. Hope this helps anyone who may need some advice.",VemMtSC,2020-03-23 18:29:13,5,476,34.1,10.01,95.35,19.5,14.88,15.13,93.49,56.51,16.39,11.34,10.29,0.21,0.21,0,0.63,5.04,4.62,12.82,9.24,7.35,8.82,2.31,17.65,7.14,2.52,1.89,2.1,1.68,5.04,2.31,2.73,0.21,0.21,0.63,3.78,0,0,0,0,14.08,2.73,1.47,1.47,3.99,1.68,4.41,3.99,0,0,2.31,7.98,1.89,4.62,0,1.89,6.09,0.63,2.1,1.05,2.31,0.42,11.13,6.09,1.47,15.13,1.89,5.46,7.98,2.73,0.21,0.84,0,0.21,0,0.42,0,0,0,0.42,0,19.12,6.3,9.87,0,0.21,0.21,0,0.42,0,1.89,0,0.21

fo8lgl,President of Harvard Tests Positive For COVID,"Dear Members of the Harvard Community,
 
Earlier today, Adele and I learned that we tested positive for COVID-19. We started experiencing symptoms on Sunday‚Äîfirst coughs then fevers, chills, and muscle aches‚Äîand contacted our doctors on Monday. We were tested yesterday and just received the results a few minutes ago. We wanted to share this news with all of you as soon as possible.
 
Neither of us knows how we contracted the virus, but the good news‚Äîif there is any to be had‚Äîis that far fewer people crossed our paths recently than is usually the case. We began working from home and completely limiting our contact with others on March 14 in keeping with recommendations to adopt social distancing measures. In line with standard protocols, the Department of Public Health will be in touch with anyone with whom we have had close contact over the past fourteen days.
 
We will be taking the time we need to rest and recuperate during a two-week isolation at home. I am blessed with a great team, and many of my colleagues will be taking on more responsibility over the next few weeks as Adele and I focus on just getting healthy. Thanks, in advance, for your good wishes. Thanks also for your understanding if I am not as responsive to email as I normally am.
 
This virus can lay anyone low. We all need to be vigilant and keep following guidelines to limit our contact with others. Your swift actions over the past few weeks‚Äîto respond to the needs of our community, to fulfill our teaching mission, and to pursue research that will save lives‚Äîhave moved me deeply and made me extraordinarily grateful and proud. I hope to see as few of you in our situation as possible, and I urge you to continue following the guidance of public health experts and the advice and orders of our government officials.
 
The world needs your courage, creativity, and intelligence to beat this virus‚Äîwishing each of you good health.
 
All the best,
Larry

fo94mb,Natural covid-19 vaccination to flatten the curve,"How about saving lives like this:
Get Covid-19 immunity for young people first by consciously contaminating them naturally to the virus. 

This could be the way to get herd immuntity faster and save lives of older people and slow down the spread and flatten the curve.

Arrange young people in camps for  2-3 weeks. So they can get immunity and go back to school and close to grandparents. (Kids have almost no symptoms). This could also work for healthy young adults and hospital personnel. The method would help to not spread the covid-19 unconsciously and get people out of quarantine.

foczyn,Question For Healthcare Professional About PPE,"I have a question for a health care professional, and I apologize in advance if it is a stupid one.

I dont know anything about PPE but read an article about how surgical masks were more complicated than people realize. It also said one of the layers was made from ""non-woven fabric"".  Since I didn't know what that was I looked for more info and found that there are many types but that the main idea is the fabric is breathable while still blocking particles. Of course the medical version is the top tier, but apparently there are more generic non-woven fabrics used for a variety of purposes, including landscaping.

Question...would there be any benefit to using one of those other types of non-woven, water-resistant fabrics as some sort of panel that slides into a hand made cloth mask? Maybe the panel could be removed and disposed of while the cloth mask gets laundered. Could it possibly offer any additional protection?

I saw these but I'm sure someone with more medical/lab knowledge would likely have a better idea.

But I wanted to make a thread to appreciate all the other essential workers at the minute because while they may not be saving lives, they are making sure everyone's lives are getting on as normal as possible and still putting themselves at risk and most people wouldn't even know.

My sister works in a TV and broadband technical department and is still having to go to work. She is someone you hope you'll never need, especially right now and yes, TV and internet aren't essential for keeping everyone alive but can you imagine being in quarantine with no internet or TV because it's broken and no one is going to be able to fix it until weeks later? Again not saving lives but definitely stopping a few family fights! 

If anyone else is still in work doing a job that the general public wouldn't even think about, add it onto the thread and maybe we can get some appreciation for all our essential workers out there we take for granted!",wizenednerd,2020-03-24 18:09:48,0,213,28.01,80.09,35.55,52.17,30.43,18.78,94.84,57.28,14.08,8.92,1.41,2.82,1.88,0.47,2.35,5.16,4.23,12.21,11.27,6.57,9.86,3.76,19.72,7.04,2.35,0,0.94,4.23,5.16,3.29,1.88,0.94,0.47,0,13.62,0.94,0,0.94,0,23,3.29,1.88,3.29,5.63,6.1,4.69,0.47,0,0,0.47,2.35,0,2.35,0,0,12.21,4.23,4.23,2.35,1.88,1.41,0.47,16.9,1.88,13.15,1.88,4.69,6.57,4.23,1.88,0.47,0.94,0,0.47,0.94,0,0,0.94,0,0,7.98,1.41,1.88,0,0.47,0.47,0.94,0,0,2.82,0,0

Fear monger from the East again just like the corona virus?

Corona virus is just a fake news with only politics purpose?

After corona virus touch down America land: Oh shit corona virus is not fake, it is real.

**The truth is now the America USA have only 2 options left on the table:**  
 1 is Death, no matter what they try and do by themselves.  
 2 is Live, only by seeking help from the savior Messiah.

**The option number 1:**  
 ‚Äì People to work: corona virus will spread, no matter what they will going to do.  
 And the damage and the dangerous of this NCOV you guys already have witness with your own eyes, not just some words from others. -&gt; So they are going to die because of this legendary beast.  
 

‚Äì People stay at home: corona virus NCOV infected case will be reduced. Mental health, potential gun fight because of bored. And the most dangerous: what about super volcano Yellow Stone erupt because lack of CO2? -&gt; So they are going to die because of shock life effect, mental health and from super volcano eruption.

An idiot with thought know that too little CO2 is the cause of global warming. And throughout history, the Asia and Europe have already received something like Spanish flu and Tambora volcano eruption. The only continent have not yet receive the natural catastrophe is the America continent.

So it is very likely, the next one it the super volcano Yellowstone.

**The option number 2:**  
 The only way for them to live is seeking help from the savior Messiah.  
 I do not know why they are too stupid, do they even read the Bible yet?  
 

Only the savior Messiah can save them directly, not the God who have created the Earth can save them directly face to face, but ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù indirectly way.

I do not want to lie but you guys cannot verify me as the God like what you thinking in your mind.

For each people have their own meaning and own dictionary about God.

And I am not going to help them for free because law of karma.

I am not going to help the ‚Äúcontroller, the rich‚Äù for free, I want them to die first if they do not wake up.

So if the USA government and patriot do not wake up and use soon to be worthless US Dollar, money and resources to seek help from the internet, from whoever claim able to handle the problems, then they are deserve to be disappeared.

And for American people: you guys better wake up, your government are gambling your life. The smart people do not take risk, but your government is just do not sure can handle the situation but keep going without warning from the savior Messiah.

If you guys think I am just a troll, then you better read many articles at theworld.data.blog from the start. Oh wait, many of them are with big ego and do not willing to accept the fact that there are some much smarter beings exist on Earth as well.

For the normal American people: If you guys cannot force your government listen to the savior Messiah, then get the hell out of the USA land as soon as possible to save your own life !!! Even stock foods is not worth now.

Only the savior Messiah can give you the right direction and handle this apocalypse situation.

fojbpo,Virus is not a living organism and there is no such thing as ‚Äòkilling the virus‚Äô. The following explains how to deal with virus. ===&gt;,"* The virus is not a living organism, but a protein molecule (DNA) covered by a protective layer of lipid (fat), which, when absorbed by the cells of the ocular, nasal or buccal mucosa, changes their genetic code.  (mutation) and convert them into aggressor and multiplier cells.
 * Since the virus is not a living organism but a protein molecule, it is not killed, but decays on its own.  The disintegration time depends on the temperature, humidity and type of material where it lies.
 * The virus is very fragile;  the only thing that protects it is a thin outer layer of fat.  That is why any soap or detergent is the best remedy, because the foam CUTS the FAT (that is why you have to rub so much: for 20 seconds or more, to make a lot of foam).  By dissolving the fat layer, the protein molecule disperses and breaks down on its own.
 * HEAT melts fat;  this is why it is so good to use water above 25 degrees Celsius for washing hands, clothes and everything.  In addition, hot water makes more foam and that makes it even more useful.
 * Alcohol or any mixture with alcohol over 65% DISSOLVES ANY FAT, especially the external lipid layer of the virus.
 * Any mix with 1 part bleach and 5 parts water directly dissolves the protein, breaks it down from the inside.
 * Oxygenated water helps long after soap, alcohol and chlorine, because peroxide dissolves the virus protein, but you have to use it pure and it hurts your skin.
 * NO BACTERICIDE SERVES.  The virus is not a living organism like bacteria;  they cannot kill what is not alive with anthobiotics, but quickly disintegrate its structure with everything said.
 * NEVER shake used or unused clothing, sheets or cloth.  While it is glued to a porous surface, it is very inert and disintegrates only between 3 hours (fabric and porous), 4 hours (copper, because it is naturally antiseptic; and wood, be
cause it removes all the moisture and does not let it peel off and disintegrates).  ), 24 hours (cardboard), 42 hours (metal) and 72 hours (plastic).  But if you shake it or use a feather duster, the virus molecules float in the air for up to 3 hours, and can lodge in your nose.
 * The virus molecules remain very stable in external cold, or artificial as air conditioners in houses and cars.  They also need moisture to stay stable, and especially darkness.  Therefore, dehumidified, dry, warm and bright environments will degrade it faster.
 * UV LIGHT on any object that may contain it breaks down the virus protein.  For example, to disinfect and reuse a mask is perfect.  Be careful, it also breaks down collagen (which is protein) in the skin, eventually causing wrinkles and skin cancer.
 * The virus CANNOT go through healthy skin.
 * Vinegar is NOT useful because it does not break down the protective layer of fat.
 * NO SPIRITS, NOR VODKA, serve.  The strongest vodka is 40% alcohol, and you need 65%.
 * LISTERINE IF IT SERVES!  It is 65% alcohol.
 * The more confined the space, the more concentration of the virus there can be.  The more open or naturally ventilated, the less.
 * This is super said, but you have to wash your hands before and after touching mucosa, food, locks, knobs, switches, remote control, cell phone, watches, computers, desks, TV, etc.  And when using the bathroom.
 * You have to HUMIDIFY HANDS DRY from so much washing them, because the molecules can hide in the micro cracks.  The thicker the moisturizer, the better.  * Also keep your NAILS SHORT so that the virus does not hide there.

fokims,What about the rest of us?,I am currently in a state of almost breakdown.Reason being well there's alot of reason but the main thing right now is.The virus has ppl buying and overbuying and not leaving things for other ppl.Everyday the stores are empty .I live week to week and I walk so cant get all over but when I do go to the store there's not food there's not anything.Ppl have been buying everything and over buying and leaving nothing for ppl like me.The same ppl that bought eberythomg out last weel are the same this week.Knowing they are over stocked.I go to store for my elderly mother and my self and there not a thing in store.Its not fair why cant the ppl that have mtns of supplies please lay off so the rest of us can get things to survive as well.Nevermind the fact I don't have money to pay someone on eBay 50 dollars for a can of lysol .This week there weren't groceries to get nor last week I am not eating hardly at all and its because ppl are not thinking of others.Its absolutely wrong.I literally only had 8 dollars to buy food last week but there wasn't not a thing to get.While some of us are starving the rest of you are downloading toilet paper counting apps.Are you serious?The same woman i saw with 4 carts last week is the same saw this week.Again with 4 carts.Its not right at all.There are some of us out here who are poor and we wouldnt effect ur buying anyways but next time maybe stop to think about the amount of things you ALREADY have when this started and u binge shopped.Think about ppl who don't have money except once a week and after bills we are broke .we cant even purchase off brand as its all gone too.I only am able to buy a small amount of things at a time and once a week .But do you think ive yet been able to buy cleaning and things to protect myself and my elderly mother.No we have not .We can only afford the dollar tree at that but yet ppl who are buying up everything at all the other stores who in fact must have money are then coming to the 1 tree and buying them out.Whem does it end when do ppl like me get a chance to buy anything .Meanwhile we are wasting away and watching the rest of the world buy and buy .Its not right.I am almost about to have a nervous breakdown.I see no solution for a person in poverty such as I .

fou2ob,Choosing between my childs safety or my parents amid Covid-19 outbreak,"Me and my spouse have been practicing social distancing and keeping to ourselves. We dont live in the city, so it's not that hard to do. My spouse and I are able to work from home and we are always well stocked on supply's (bit of ""preppers""). 

Recently, family members have urged my spouse and I to take in a family member (middle aged, not the best health) to come stay with us. Said family member lives with multiple other family members in a small single bathroom home. One of said family members  is a healthcare worker who continues to work rediculouse hours, and another is an uber/grocery delivery driver who up until today continued to work. So combined, they come in close contact/proximity with 100+ people per day. 

My child is my number one priority it this world. I would kill for my kid. If I have to choose, I'm going to pick my kid over anyone every single time. 

If I take said family member in, I put my kid (and my spousr) at a much higher risk of contracting the virus. But on the same token, if something does happen to said family member, and they pass, in the future my kid may blame me for not taking said family member in. 

I'm torn. 

Do I say f*ck everyone and everything, only my kid matters? Or do I let them come stay with me because it's the caring and generous thing to do?

Also, for all we know, my spouse and I may already have it, and may just end up giving it to said family member because we just aren't showing signs of having it yet.

foy626,Question Concerning Relief Aid (US),"Hey everyone!

I wasn't completely sure where to post this- so i apologize if its the wrong sub and i'll switch over if requested. I've been reading about the US response to the COVID 19 outbreak and their plans to provide relief to citizens. I'm a university student who was laid off due to the outbreak, and although I'm looking for a new occupation, its not quite the job-heavy climate with so much going on right now (plus i'm asthmetic, so that doesn't help). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, all the sources I've seen mention a 1,200 USD payment to adults with 500 to children. Due to being a university student, i have to file my taxes as a dependent. I'm not close to my parents, and they use the tax benefits to help themselves and have no input to my life anymore, but I have to remain a dependent for a few more years (stated by my college)- does anyone know if the ""child"" category is specifically dependents, and that 'adults' is defined by independents? Should I be budgeting for an expected 1200 relief USD or expecting the 500? 

&amp;#x200B;

fp1xer,How to explain to my boyfriend that he is not exempt from social distancing.,"(X-posted to advice)
(Originally posted in r/relationships)

We have been together for a bit more than a year.

Where I live isn't in official, legally enforced lockdown yet, but I suspect it soon will be. Currently we are all being told to ""stay home and practise social distancing"" in an effort to curb the spread, but the numbers of infected people are rising daily.

My boyfriend and I do not live together. In fact, we both live with our respective families. My parents are  in their fifties and sixties and have hypertension, which puts them at high risk. My boyfriend's mother smokes, and he himself is asthmatic, which I'm pretty sure makes both of them high risk.

I am not happy that I probably won't be able to see my boyfriend in person for months, especially as the last time I saw him I had no idea that we would soon be in this situation where everyone is being asked to stay at home to prevent the spread. The situation with Covid 19 got very fucking real very suddenly. We had no preparation, no warning that suddenly we would just be separated for the better part of a year.

And obviously this sucks, but what's worse is that he DOES NOT UNDERSTAND that this social distancing stuff applies to him and I. He isn't actively fighting me on it anymore, but he seems to think that I could just come over whenever I want if I really wanted to. It's like he thinks I'm just being anxious and paranoid and stubborn. 

I've tried sending him links to articles explaining the seriousness of the illness. I've tried telling him that even if in general young people can handle it better, there are plenty of young, perfectly healthy people who have had serious cases and even died from it. He waves it off as doom and gloom and me focusing on the worst possibilities - and it's true, I can be over anxious about stuff. But I'm pretty sure this isn't the case this time.

He's not totally flippant. He understands the concept of ""flattening the curb"" and I believe he is taking relevant precautions when running necessary errands. He isn't meeting in person with friends and from what I understand he is only taking occasional, necessary trips to the grocery store when he leaves his house. He was laid off from his job just as shit was starting to get real here, because the industry he works in was very hard hit and basically ordered to shut down entirely.

So it's not like he doesn't get it at all, but as far as he's concerned, if I'm not socially distancing from my parents (whom I live with), there's no reason I have to socially distance myself from him. I really think he believes that I can just consider him a ""house member accessory"" or something, but I can't. 

We don't live together. We both individually still have to interact, minimally, with the public by going grocery shopping (though I do have n95 masks that I got for work ages ago, which I have been using). It sounds like his mother is still visiting friends and family, which is not something that is my place to protest, but it adds to the fact that my household and his household are not and could never be considered a ""closed unit"".

If I unknowingly pass the disease to him or his family, or take it from his household and pass it on to my own, and they have a serious case or die, I could never forgive myself. I have actually broken down crying on the phone explaining my concern to him, and I believe that is why he has stopped fighting me about it, but it doesn't mean he really understands.

Just today he asked me when I will come see him again, and I told him it might be awhile. He said ""come onnnnn"". I dread the likelihood that we will get into a fight about it again. It's hard enough coming to terms with the reality that I'm not going to see him in person for almost a year, possibly, or several months at the least - and face the hopefully unnecessary worry that because his mother isn't being very cautious, he could well die anyway and I'd never see him again at all - without him being on the same page as me.

So if you have any advice on how to get through to him, and really get him to understand that this is serious, longterm, and not just me acting out an anxious whim... please give it to me.

TL;DR: How do I get my boyfriend to understand that I won't be able to see him for quite awhile due to lockdown and social distancing because of Covid 19, and that I can't just ""make an exception"" for him because that isn't how social distancing WORKS?",pyritha,2020-03-25 17:42:55,9,842,14.33,44.81,53.31,9.64,23.39,17.1,94.66,62.59,21.62,14.61,7.13,1.19,0.12,5.7,0.48,7.01,4.04,12.35,11.05,7.6,8.19,3.8,20.78,4.75,2.02,2.26,0.48,1.78,4.99,1.78,3.09,0.95,0.95,0.36,14.49,0.95,0.83,0.36,6.29,15.08,2.85,1.54,1.66,3.09,2.26,5.82,1.43,0.83,0.36,0.24,2.02,0.24,1.31,0.12,0.36,9.5,4.16,1.31,0.95,1.9,1.54,2.97,14.85,1.54,13.06,2.02,6.53,4.75,1.07,0.59,1.19,0.24,0.12,0.36,0.71,0.36,0.12,0,0.12,0.12,15.8,4.39,4.51,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,0.48,1.43,3.56,0.95,0.12

**Abstract**

This article is to give importance to this disease from linking real reason of this pandemic to give genetical solution as medics to heal people from also the enlightenment of ideas about moving in large scale and tackle this by soberness to give understands to evolutionary fact which has found the relationship between two major issues. This article is to stress the importance of this knowledge about against evolutionary human behaviors to have caused a gene mal-alterative mishap to cause vulnerability and bigger fact realistic tumor in our nowadays lives. This article has offered a solution that is one and lasts to have us have a picture of what we do to help by **‚Äúif we correct the gene feast pattern of lost in its immunity contribution‚Äù** to give a cure in genetic study on the any allergic system for the chance to get infectious will can help the virus home to get into its real division from both one as attackers and the other as the passive intakers of the wrong working of nowadays to back to its normality to contribute deaths for the cure of human to let the evolutionary forgoing to get its real purpose realize to change into polluen pore pattern primary in the outer space for get their niche back to normal as an effort.

**Text**

The death correlation with evolutionary in its cause being under controlled protection of our food and immune. Normally, the food and immune is not there but later we found the evolutionary and evolve to have the mechanism to offer food from other affinity species for us to have immune system to working to get themselves protected by a strength humanity and the possible to take advantage of their species from dying. So I think the mechanism of food is just a population over-develop control, and also the immune system evolves simultaneously with the same process to cause us to digest hard food from to get an ideas to what kind of food is better for us to get us last. However, the risk is once we take food from other species, our immune system will be broken if we against the natural law of fooding, and once our immune system gets crazy the things get crazy is our fooding behavior. So that is to say, we might choose to have food, but the result that we go for food without any concern to take can also decides that we are going to have diseases. So that is to say, the negativities evolves with each other, not the negativity of food and acquired immune, but the motive we treat food and the routine we make food for.

So to elaborate this a little bit. It is like gene, gene has a base of itself, and it has messages to take to fabricate things. So gene itself decides people‚Äôs future in a way that the process people are practicing according to the information carried in gene. So the argument about morality and feasibility reach of gene should focus on people‚Äôs starting to own the gene, while its utilize of gene to guide itself. To separate only means people should respect what‚Äôs from themselves and get into the way gene carries, or else, we are going to against gene and be deprived with the right of having it.

This is serious, in the future, people don‚Äôt have right to their own gene, and people are against its gene, that can make science have no leg to put into practice science, and also to let the law has no saying if public oral has tended to make the wrong things last for a long time. That is to say, to stop a disaster that people treat their food to gain immunity relates tightly with the future of our owning of precious gene form us. An another example the uncarefulness causes disaster.

By this means, **if we correct the gene feast pattern of lost in its immunity contribution**, will gives light to our lives that this course replayed as the rule why we need to respect other animals to give their way of living for less enemies. So this treatment, this genetic medication solution is never is vaccinated for allergic reason but not for this, it is just a way that we should use this control to achieve a resolution like we have made this too deep too bad we need to turn back to normality. So any medicine to vaccinate with new treatment is actually has its historically revolutionary threshold with big severe crisis like, this one.

This one is an ill, but for people so many and human involvement so big, it is a syndrome, for the causes why we can find a cure for it it is like an cancer like AIDS, and for the reason why people should treat it it is like a flu, for the information we got it is like a flu, but anyhow from the looking of it, are so shockingly slow and pandemic, it is like a plague.

So for a plague happens on the camps of enemies, never like a plaguy happens on our camp, if you take it as a victory horn, just think it is a pup for others to enjoy however for us, it is a sign of lost, a lost for our far away sensibility and our miss of the other side.

Thus, this is also to claim, this pandemic disease is for functional human beings are just as mystery void. It has no origin, it is a thing that put in hand, it has no result, for solving it, we just get nothing. So why not forget about its coming from but think about what behind causes its like this, and also ponder about not what we can get from treatment, to give ways to the what‚Äôs important for us, to give rooms for chances for people and businesses to negotiate a avenue for future development by giving care?

For death is like healing, it‚Äôs end while has a start by thinking alone by this two paradoxes. However, if you think the life is long lasting and also to let alive is anything rule of treating diseases, it‚Äôs like also the solution for the war and for the biggest landscape of worlds. It is still an unchanged truth that most of us don‚Äôt have diseases, but once we lost the battle of getting vaccination isolation, or based on spreading or even taking medication of us, will definitely become the enemies of us. And why, the communist country is doing what they could to use human product to give natural independent immunology to guard their clothes fare.

So for western country, I believe, an attitude to evade the facts people often say that religiously the God will come back for everybody except for those who are not here. To think why the God didn‚Äôt can save one life but to have can give life to Christ? It‚Äôs tricky to have one idol to get anything good but however it takes lives to have this idol. Thus my suggestion is to lose idol that can give you thing just for save themselves.

Politically and economically, people face things like this, they often seek other people to help, but for the rule of sensibility and unity itself, it really needs a rational thinking to put into the global action to figure a way for good and for potentials. Like the American and the USA did, they emphasize the strength of science, and stresses the people‚Äôs power to get involved, really has made us a feeling of control and positive. So that is to say, it gives power to people, and with hope everybody works for this. And this is the way for the whole globe to understand and learn to mimic its regime and effective aftermaths, if it is not, we couldn‚Äôt get through this.

So finally, seek for media for helping your problems, go for the scholars for tips to get a bigger picture of how to get rid of crisis. Thus this thing can really become the help of victory of human kind, not being an another example of others left us there nobody cares us, even kaola bears any more.",zhengruqian,2020-03-26 05:15:57,9,1425,79.1,76.51,13.01,20.46,35.62,17.61,88.91,57.19,13.54,4.77,0.21,3.44,0.28,0,0.84,8.77,7.65,18.11,8,5.19,7.02,1.61,16.14,2.67,2.11,1.12,0.98,1.05,4.42,2.04,2.39,0.28,0.56,0.77,9.33,0,0,0,0,13.33,3.58,3.37,1.47,1.96,1.12,4,0.98,0.28,0.42,0.28,4.21,0.28,2.88,0.07,1.12,11.44,3.93,2.11,2.74,2.53,1.12,1.19,12.84,1.05,7.93,1.4,4.35,2.46,1.75,0,0.14,0.14,0.35,0.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.09,2.67,5.19,0.07,0.07,0.14,0,0.21,0.28,0.84,0,1.61

My point being why not let each suburb know ASAP when a person has been found to be positive. So people can become more paranoid and take it more seriously? As in avoiding supermarkets for a couple of weeks? Or being super careful when doing similar tasks when out and about?

fpeqjb,"Minnesota/Wisconsin-Is/will travel across the state line be permitted? If not, could someone get stuck away from home?","So my boyfriend and I live near the state line for MN and WI. He lives on the Wisconsin side and I live on the Minnesota side.

He is running low on food for his reptiles and the only place he can get it without driving about 2 hours is in Minnesota. He works today (at a gas station) so he can‚Äôt make it today, but wants to go tomorrow and spend the night at my place.

I understand him spending the night at my place isn‚Äôt social distancing and I understand the risk, but it‚Äôs really only a risk for me as I‚Äôm currently working from home and I don‚Äôt leave my apartment for any reasons aside from getting groceries and shipping orders for my Etsy shop once a week, and obviously he‚Äôs at a constant risk from working at a gas station and living with someone else who also has to leave on a daily basis to work for a job considered essential.

I‚Äôm saying that so y‚Äôall don‚Äôt shit on me for letting him spend the night, although you probably still will. 

Anyway, as the safer at home order just went into place in Wisconsin and the stay at home order goes in place in Minnesota on Friday night, I‚Äôm worried he might get stuck in MN if he does spend the night.

I have seen no evidence this could happen anywhere online based on the rules of the orders in both states, but I am hearing people on the Wisconsin side say the state lines will be monitored and people will not be allowed across.

I‚Äôm not sure where they are getting this information, or when that will go into effect so if someone with more knowledge than I can let me know if this is true or not that would be great.

If he were to get stuck at my place in Minnesota he would not be able to access any of his schoolwork which resumes online next week since he only has a desktop PC and doesn‚Äôt seem to understand how portable drives work and doesn‚Äôt have one.

I would like to be able to factually explain to him why he can‚Äôt spend the night if that‚Äôs the case since he doesn‚Äôt seem to believe these rules are being enforced at all and they might not be idk.",ogcaryts,2020-03-26 09:41:01,1,414,45.02,23.44,86.2,22.04,31.85,14.25,91.55,59.18,14.73,10.87,5.56,0,0.48,4.35,0.48,3.86,6.28,14.98,11.84,4.59,8.7,4.11,22.46,2.66,1.21,1.45,0.72,1.21,2.66,1.21,1.45,0.97,0.24,0.24,8.21,0,0.24,0,4.59,16.67,3.38,2.66,2.9,4.59,1.45,6.04,0.97,0.24,0.72,0,1.69,0.24,0.97,0,0.48,7.25,0.48,1.69,2.17,1.93,0.97,1.45,17.63,2.17,19.81,2.66,11.59,5.31,2.42,0.72,1.21,1.45,0,0,0.72,0.24,0.24,0,0,0.48,10.39,2.66,2.17,0,0,0.48,0,0.24,0,3.86,0.48,0.48

It wouldn't cost $324 million dollars to get 13,500 people back to the US. 

Is somebody evacuating out of the U.S.? Are the politicians all heading to a tropical island somewhere to wait out the virus? 

Anyone understand this?

### ""Evacuations of Americans

The bill includes $324 million for the State Department, as well as money specifically for ""evacuation expenses,"" according to a draft obtained by  CNN. The proposed legislation doesn't specify who would be evacuated,  whether it's US diplomats or American citizens living overseas, or potentially both.A senior State  Department official said that 9,300 Americans had already been repatriated. A different senior State Department official said the  government was tracking 13,500 Americans seeking assistance abroad.*-- Marshall Cohen and Jennifer Hansler* ""

fprj97,Lost respect for my company (Trader Joe‚Äôs) after their treatment of ‚Äúessential‚Äù employees,"Just take a look around /tjcrew reddit. The company has had multiple stores close (eight) but there are many more that have had confirmed positives and they that are urging employees to keep quiet about. I am absolutely disgusted that they can put SO MANY customers at risk like this! 

Employees have begged for measures to protect staff but they have laughed most of them off until a bad press article came out so now they are finally allowing employees to take action to protect themselves but they judge employees HARD for this. They‚Äôve also been trying to lap up the PR bs...putting out social media posts to look like they are ‚Äúhiring‚Äù during times of need but very few stores actually have open spaces or the need. 

Instead of offering hazard pay they gave a one time bonus to employees that is around $200 pre tax and they aren‚Äôt doing any paid leaves of absence. After workers asked for hazard pay they switched the title of the bonus to ‚Äúhazard‚Äù pay. All this from a company that had record breaking sales in the past month. 

I feel so disheartened. I thought this company was different and I feel so awful for the employees in the stores and for the thousands upon thousands of customers that they are serving that are potentially at risk!",tjunreal,2020-03-26 22:41:02,0,238,71.44,59.96,33.76,4.48,21.64,18.49,92.02,52.94,12.61,7.98,2.1,0,0,0,5.88,4.62,5.46,16.81,9.24,6.72,6.3,0.42,16.81,4.2,2.94,0,2.1,3.36,6.3,2.1,4.2,0.84,0,0.84,9.24,0,0,0,0,9.66,1.26,0.42,0.84,2.1,1.68,3.78,3.36,0.84,0.84,1.68,0,0,0,0,0,13.03,0.42,2.52,5.88,2.1,3.36,5.46,10.92,0.42,12.18,2.1,5.88,4.2,8.82,0.42,0,5.88,0,0,1.26,0.42,0.84,0.42,0,0,11.76,4.62,0,0,0,0,0.84,0,2.52,1.26,1.68,0.84
fpruxk,Lost respect for Trader Joe‚Äôs amidst pandemic,"I‚Äôve completely lost respect for and frankly I‚Äôm sickened by Trader Joe‚Äôs has treated its essential workers. This is a company that puts on a facade of being ‚Äúfamily‚Äù but they are far from it. Just look around the /tjcrew subreddit

The company since The beginning of March has absolutely not allowed employees to wear any form of protective gear (even gloves) while working. Nor were any acknowledgements of employees being essential workers working through a pandemic sent out to stores until two days ago. The company only wanted to focus on keeping stores ‚Äúfun‚Äù and sales up. Employees have been complaining like crazy begging for safety measures to be taken and the company always responds with ‚Äúif we aren‚Äôt fun customers won‚Äôt come back‚Äù.  I think customers would actually appreciate a company that has a concern for their health!

Stores are slowly allowing employees to wear protective gear but that‚Äôs only after 8 stores with multiple employees have tested positive in the past week along with some bad press in California media outlets. There are eight that closed but there are at least two more that they are trying to keep hush hush and not closing. Stores that have closed only close for 3 days but that‚Äôs not nearly enough time to quarantine staff so that they don‚Äôt infect customers. How can they put thousands of people at risk like this? Especially with the elderly demographic that loves the company? 

They aren‚Äôt offering any kind of hazard pay through this NOR are they offering paid sick time or leaves of absence. They offered employees a one time bonus of $200 pre tax and that‚Äôs IT. When employees complained they later changed the title of bonus to ‚Äúhazard pay‚Äù. All of this after each of the companies stores had record sales bringing in a million or more (each week) at many of the stores.

It honestly sickens me that they can put so many people‚Äôs health at risk like this in order to make a buck. The people working in stores do not have the training (nor did they ask to) work through a pandemic like this but they‚Äôre out there and they are begging the company to keep them and their customers safe! Many people that speak up honestly fear they may lose their job. 

The PR team also put out a BS instagram post saying they were hiring when unemployment became a hot topic but many of the stores are NOT hiring nor do they have the space to hire. I‚Äôm devastated and feel helpless",tjunreL,2020-03-26 23:08:32,2,433,70.54,55.5,39.47,13.31,19.68,19.17,92.38,51.27,10.62,5.54,1.15,0.23,0,0,4.16,5.08,6.47,15.01,9.7,4.85,6.7,3,17.32,3.7,2.31,0.69,2.08,3.46,6.93,3,3.93,0.69,0,1.15,10.39,0.23,0,0,0,11.78,1.15,1.39,0.69,2.54,2.08,4.85,1.85,0.23,0.92,0.69,1.62,0.46,0.92,0,0,10.85,1.15,3,4.62,0.92,2.54,3.7,10.85,0.46,12.93,2.54,5.31,4.85,8.78,1.15,0.23,6,0,0,0.46,0.23,0.23,0.23,0,0,11.55,3.7,0,0,0,0.46,0.46,0,1.85,3.23,1.39,0.46

fpy1nv,"The state of West Virginia in the US is particularly vulnerable as it has some of the highest rates of risk factors in the country, such as the highest rate of coronary heath disease (7.6%), hypertension (41%), obesity (40%), etc.","West Virginia is particularly vulnerable with some of the highest prevalences of risk factors in the US

 I‚Äôm worried for West Virginia, we have ~40% obesity rate (highest in the country), 15.3% have diabetes, 26% smoke, 41% have hypertension, and 7.6% have coronary heart disease, the highest in the country. I fear we will be absolutely shafted. It is very likely that these people would die. 

However, I read that we have the second highest number of ventilators per capita in the country. Does anyone know the number? I assume it‚Äôs concentrated in Mon county or Kanawha county. Kinda glad I live in Mon right now lol.

Currently we have 76 cases in the whole state but likely we have a significant amount of people infected who are undetected. I‚Äôve read that usually the actual amount of infected is more like 10-50x the number of confirmed cases, likely somewhere in the middle like ~760-3800 (2280 avg) so 0.04%-0.2% (0.12%) of the population infected. 

Where I live in Monongalia county, we have 24 cases, and a majority of them are from a nursing home. I imagine that we likely have 240-1200 (720 avg) infected and 0.23-1.14% (0.658% avg) of the population infected. So I imagine that a grocery store worker who checks out ~200 people a shift would likely encounter 0.5-2 (avg ~1) people.

What do you think will happen to West Virginia? We have a stay at home order. I hope our hospitals don‚Äôt get overrun and lots of people die. We are a very unhealthy state. 

Yeah where I live we have 117.000 people. Morgantown is a decently populated city and we have 26,000 students 14,000 of which are from out of state and the statistics say that the majority of our out of state students come from hotspot states and they likely visited home over spring break. That is not even counting how many of the 27,000 students went on vacation over spring break to tourist areas. I fear that the students may have brought a shitload if the virus to our town. So now it will infect the vulnerable people when they go to the grocery store or other ways of getting infected indirectly from the people who traveled.

I wonder what the number of ventilators we have is. Also I hope our hospital workers have adequate PPE. We have a really good hospital in my town I hope they are prepared.

However my psychiatrist is a complete dumbass; I have been warning her about this for over a month and telling her how scared I am and she made it so I don‚Äôt have to go in physically for my controlled medications, which I was worried about, but while I‚Äôm in the room with her a few weeks ago, she tells me that she has been taking advantage of the cheap group tours in DC and went to the cherry blossom festival and shit and I was thinking  fuck you know how scared I am why do that to me when I‚Äôm near you and you are gonna get infected you dumbass. Plus she is obese! 

Sorry I‚Äôm ranting lol.


Also I know my math is probably shit for those calculations I did for the cashiers but I like trying to calculate these things. If you have any pointers please help me.",majoses77,2020-03-27 07:40:36,0,605,55.04,65.43,43.37,14.38,20.17,18.68,83.8,53.39,16.53,11.57,5.62,3.14,0.99,1.16,0.66,4.79,7.44,11.9,10.25,5.12,6.12,0.5,16.86,2.81,1.98,2.48,5.79,2.15,5.45,2.31,3.14,1.82,0.99,0.17,8.93,0,0,1.16,0,8.6,1.65,0.99,1.16,3.97,0.66,1.98,0.17,0,0.17,0,6.45,0.66,4.46,0.83,0.99,8.93,3.47,0.83,3.64,1.16,0.5,1.98,12.73,1.49,13.06,1.65,8.76,2.31,1.49,0.5,0.66,0.5,0,0.33,1.98,0.99,0.66,0.33,0,0,16.53,4.46,3.31,0,0.17,0.33,0.17,0.99,0,1.32,2.98,2.81

# Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)

&amp;#x200B;

March 7, 2020

**Summary of Recent Changes**

**Update: This Interim Guidance was updated on March 7, 2020 to make the following changes:**

* **Updating recommendations regarding HCP contact tracing, monitoring, and work restrictions in selected circumstances. These include allowances for asymptomatic HCP who have had an exposure to a COVID-19 patient to continue to work after options to improve staffing have been exhausted and in consultation with their occupational health program. (See Additional Considerations and Recommendations at the end of the document)**
* **Removed requirement under ‚Äúself monitoring with delegated supervision‚Äù for healthcare facilities to actively verify absence of fever and respiratory symptoms when healthcare personnel (HCP) report for work. This is now optional.**
* **Simplified risk exposure categories based on most common scenarios with focus on presence/absence of source control measures; use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by HCP; and degree of contact with the patient (i.e., prolonged versus brief)**
* **Added language advising HCP to inform their occupational health program if they have travel or community-associated exposures as defined in** [**Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html)**.**

## Background

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in humans and in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with [SARS](https://www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html)\-CoV, MERS-CoV, and now with SARS-CoV-2.

Published and early reports suggest spread from person-to-person most frequently happens during close exposure to a person infected with COVID-19. Person-to-person appears to occur similar to other respiratory viruses, mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.  Although not likely to be the predominant mode of transmission, it is not clear the extent to which touching a surface contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes contributes to transmission.

## Purpose

This interim guidance is intended to assist with assessment of risk, monitoring, and work restriction decisions for HCP with potential exposure to COVID-19.  For guidance on assessment and management of exposure risk in non-healthcare settings, refer to the [Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html).  The guidance for non-healthcare settings can also be used to identify the movement, public activity and travel restrictions that apply to the HCP included here.

Because of their often extensive and close contact with vulnerable individuals in healthcare settings, a conservative approach to HCP monitoring and restriction from work was taken to quickly identify early symptoms and prevent transmission from potentially contagious HCP to patients, HCP, and visitors.  The signs and symptoms[\*](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/index.html?chost=tools.cdc.gov&amp;cpath=/medialibrary/index.aspx&amp;csearch=&amp;chash=%2Fmedia%2Fid%2F404340&amp;ctitle=Public%20Health%20Media%20Library&amp;wn=syndicationIframe&amp;wf=/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/&amp;wid=syndicationIframe1&amp;mMode=widget&amp;mPage=&amp;mChannel=&amp;class=rid_0efb07e6_404340&amp;iframeembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-widget-external-loader.js&amp;apiembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/html/js/embed-2.0.3.js&amp;iframe=true&amp;nw=true&amp;ns=cdc&amp;of=xhtml&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;cssclasses=syndicate,!no-syndicate&amp;stripstyles=true&amp;stripcomments=true&amp;stripimages=false&amp;stripanchors=false&amp;stripscripts=true&amp;mediaid=404340&amp;mediatype=html&amp;apiroot=//tools.cdc.gov/api#note1) described in this guidance are broader than those described when assessing exposures for individuals not working in healthcare.  Healthcare facilities should have a low threshold for evaluating symptoms and testing symptomatic HCP, particularly those who fall into the *high-* and *medium-* *risk* categories described in this guidance.

This guidance is based on currently available data about COVID-19. Recommendations regarding which HCP are restricted from work may not anticipate every potential scenario and will change if indicated by new information.

Healthcare facilities, in consultation with public health authorities, should use clinical judgement as well as the principles outlined in this guidance to assign risk and determine need for work restrictions.  CDC remains available for further consultation by calling the Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States.

#### I. Definitions Used in this Guidance

***Self-monitoring*** means HCP should monitor themselves for fever by taking their temperature twice a day and remain alert for respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat)[\*](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/index.html?chost=tools.cdc.gov&amp;cpath=/medialibrary/index.aspx&amp;csearch=&amp;chash=%2Fmedia%2Fid%2F404340&amp;ctitle=Public%20Health%20Media%20Library&amp;wn=syndicationIframe&amp;wf=/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/&amp;wid=syndicationIframe1&amp;mMode=widget&amp;mPage=&amp;mChannel=&amp;class=rid_0efb07e6_404340&amp;iframeembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-widget-external-loader.js&amp;apiembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/html/js/embed-2.0.3.js&amp;iframe=true&amp;nw=true&amp;ns=cdc&amp;of=xhtml&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;cssclasses=syndicate,!no-syndicate&amp;stripstyles=true&amp;stripcomments=true&amp;stripimages=false&amp;stripanchors=false&amp;stripscripts=true&amp;mediaid=404340&amp;mediatype=html&amp;apiroot=//tools.cdc.gov/api#note1). Anyone on self-monitoring should be provided a plan for whom to contact if they develop fever or respiratory symptoms during the self-monitoring period to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.

***Active monitoring*** means that the state or local public health authority assumes responsibility for establishing regular communication with potentially exposed people to assess for the presence of fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat)[\*](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/index.html?chost=tools.cdc.gov&amp;cpath=/medialibrary/index.aspx&amp;csearch=&amp;chash=%2Fmedia%2Fid%2F404340&amp;ctitle=Public%20Health%20Media%20Library&amp;wn=syndicationIframe&amp;wf=/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/&amp;wid=syndicationIframe1&amp;mMode=widget&amp;mPage=&amp;mChannel=&amp;class=rid_0efb07e6_404340&amp;iframeembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-widget-external-loader.js&amp;apiembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/html/js/embed-2.0.3.js&amp;iframe=true&amp;nw=true&amp;ns=cdc&amp;of=xhtml&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;cssclasses=syndicate,!no-syndicate&amp;stripstyles=true&amp;stripcomments=true&amp;stripimages=false&amp;stripanchors=false&amp;stripscripts=true&amp;mediaid=404340&amp;mediatype=html&amp;apiroot=//tools.cdc.gov/api#note1). For HCP with *high-* or *medium-risk* exposures, CDC recommends this communication occurs at least once each day**.** The mode of communication can be determined by the state or local public health authority and may include telephone calls or any electronic or internet-based means of communication.

For HCP, active monitoring can be delegated by the health department to the HCP‚Äôs healthcare facility occupational health or infection control program, if both the health department and the facility are in agreement. Note, inter-jurisdictional coordination will be needed if HCP live in a different local health jurisdiction than where the healthcare facility is located.

***Self-Monitoring with delegated supervision*** in a healthcare setting means HCP perform self-monitoring with oversight by their healthcare facility‚Äôs occupational health or infection control program in coordination with the health department of jurisdiction, if both the health department and the facility are in agreement. On days HCP are scheduled to work, healthcare facilities could consider measuring temperature and assessing symptoms prior to starting work.  Alternatively, a facility may consider having HCP report temperature and absence of symptoms to occupational health prior to starting work.  Modes of communication may include telephone calls or any electronic or internet-based means of communication.

Occupational health or infection control personnel should establish points of contact between the organization, the self-monitoring personnel, and the local or state health departments of authority in the location where self-monitoring personnel will be during the self-monitoring period. This communication should result in agreement on a plan for medical evaluation of personnel who develop fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat)[\*](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/index.html?chost=tools.cdc.gov&amp;cpath=/medialibrary/index.aspx&amp;csearch=&amp;chash=%2Fmedia%2Fid%2F404340&amp;ctitle=Public%20Health%20Media%20Library&amp;wn=syndicationIframe&amp;wf=/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/&amp;wid=syndicationIframe1&amp;mMode=widget&amp;mPage=&amp;mChannel=&amp;class=rid_0efb07e6_404340&amp;iframeembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-widget-external-loader.js&amp;apiembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/html/js/embed-2.0.3.js&amp;iframe=true&amp;nw=true&amp;ns=cdc&amp;of=xhtml&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;cssclasses=syndicate,!no-syndicate&amp;stripstyles=true&amp;stripcomments=true&amp;stripimages=false&amp;stripanchors=false&amp;stripscripts=true&amp;mediaid=404340&amp;mediatype=html&amp;apiroot=//tools.cdc.gov/api#note1) during the self-monitoring period. The plan should include instructions for notifying occupational health and the local public health authority, and transportation arrangements to a designated hospital, if medically necessary, with advance notice if fever or respiratory symptoms occur. The supervising organization should remain in contact with HCP through the self-monitoring period to manage self-monitoring activities and provide timely and appropriate follow-up if symptoms occur in a HCP. Note, inter-jurisdictional coordination will be needed if HCP live in a different local health jurisdiction than where the healthcare facility is located.

**Close contact** for healthcare exposures is defined as follows: a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), of a person with COVID-19 for a prolonged period of time (such as caring for or visiting the patient; or sitting within 6 feet of the patient in a healthcare waiting area or room); or b) having unprotected direct contact with infectious secretions or excretions of the patient (e.g., being coughed on, touching used tissues with a bare hand).

Data are limited for definitions of close contact.  Factors for consideration include the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk), clinical symptoms of the patient (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk) and whether the patient was wearing a facemask (which can efficiently block respiratory secretions from contaminating others and the environment), PPE used by personnel, and whether aerosol-generating procedures were performed.

Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure.  However, until more is known about transmission risks, it is reasonable to consider an exposure greater than a few minutes as a prolonged exposure.  Brief interactions are less likely to result in transmission; however, clinical symptoms of the patient and type of interaction (e.g., did the patient cough directly into the face of the HCP) remain important.  Recommendations will be updated as more information becomes available.

Risk stratification can be made in consultation with public health authorities.  Examples of brief interactions include: briefly entering the patient room without having direct contact with the patient or their secretions/excretions, brief conversation at a triage desk with a patient who was not wearing a facemask. See [Table 1](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/index.html?chost=tools.cdc.gov&amp;cpath=/medialibrary/index.aspx&amp;csearch=&amp;chash=%2Fmedia%2Fid%2F404340&amp;ctitle=Public%20Health%20Media%20Library&amp;wn=syndicationIframe&amp;wf=/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/&amp;wid=syndicationIframe1&amp;mMode=widget&amp;mPage=&amp;mChannel=&amp;class=rid_0efb07e6_404340&amp;iframeembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-widget-external-loader.js&amp;apiembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/html/js/embed-2.0.3.js&amp;iframe=true&amp;nw=true&amp;ns=cdc&amp;of=xhtml&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;cssclasses=syndicate,!no-syndicate&amp;stripstyles=true&amp;stripcomments=true&amp;stripimages=false&amp;stripanchors=false&amp;stripscripts=true&amp;mediaid=404340&amp;mediatype=html&amp;apiroot=//tools.cdc.gov/api#table1) for more detailed information.

***Healthcare Personnel***:  For the purposes of this document HCP refers to all paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials, including body substances; contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment; contaminated environmental surfaces; or contaminated air. For this document, HCP does not include clinical laboratory personnel.

#### II. Defining Exposure Risk Category

While body fluids other than respiratory secretions have not been clearly implicated in transmission of COVID-19, unprotected contact with other body fluids, including blood, stool, vomit, and urine, might put HCP at risk of COVID-19.

Table 1 describes possible scenarios that can be used to assist with risk assessment.  These scenarios do not cover all potential exposure scenarios and should not replace an individual assessment of risk for the purpose of clinical decision making or individualized public health management. Any public health decisions that place restrictions on an individual‚Äôs or group‚Äôs movements or impose specific monitoring requirements should be based on an assessment of risk for the individual or group.  Healthcare facilities, in consultation with public health authorities should use the concepts outlined in this guidance along with clinical judgement to assign risk and determine need for work restrictions.

For this guidance *high-risk* exposures refer to HCP who have had prolonged close contact with patients with COVID-19 who were not wearing a facemask while HCP nose and mouth were exposed to material potentially infectious with the virus causing COVID-19.  Being present in the room for procedures that generate aerosols or during which respiratory secretions are likely to be poorly controlled (e.g., cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation, extubation, bronchoscopy, nebulizer therapy, sputum induction) on patients with COVID-19 when the healthcare providers‚Äô eyes, nose, or mouth were not protected, is also considered *high-risk*.

*Medium-risk* exposures generally include HCP who had prolonged close contact with patients with COVID-19 who were wearing a facemask while HCP nose and mouth were exposed to material potentially infectious with the virus causing COVID-19.  Some *low-risk* exposures are considered *medium-risk* depending on the type of care activity performed.  For example, HCP who were wearing a gown, gloves, eye protection and a facemask (instead of a respirator) during an aerosol-generating procedure would be considered to have a medium-risk exposure.  If an aerosol-generating procedure had not been performed, they would have been considered *low-risk*.  See [Table 1](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/index.html?chost=tools.cdc.gov&amp;cpath=/medialibrary/index.aspx&amp;csearch=&amp;chash=%2Fmedia%2Fid%2F404340&amp;ctitle=Public%20Health%20Media%20Library&amp;wn=syndicationIframe&amp;wf=/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/&amp;wid=syndicationIframe1&amp;mMode=widget&amp;mPage=&amp;mChannel=&amp;class=rid_0efb07e6_404340&amp;iframeembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-widget-external-loader.js&amp;apiembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/html/js/embed-2.0.3.js&amp;iframe=true&amp;nw=true&amp;ns=cdc&amp;of=xhtml&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;cssclasses=syndicate,!no-syndicate&amp;stripstyles=true&amp;stripcomments=true&amp;stripimages=false&amp;stripanchors=false&amp;stripscripts=true&amp;mediaid=404340&amp;mediatype=html&amp;apiroot=//tools.cdc.gov/api#table1) for additional examples.

*Low-risk* exposures generally refer to brief interactions with patients with COVID-19 or prolonged close contact with patients who were wearing a facemask for source control while HCP were wearing a facemask or respirator. Use of eye protection, in addition to a facemask or respirator would further lower the risk of exposure.

Proper adherence to currently recommended infection control practices, including all recommended PPE, should protect HCP having prolonged close contact with patients infected with COVID-19.  However, to account for any inconsistencies in use or adherence that could result in unrecognized exposures HCP should still perform self-monitoring with delegated supervision.

HCP with no direct patient contact and no entry into active patient management areas who adhere to routine safety precautions do not have a risk of exposure to COVID-19 (i.e., they have *no identifiable risk*.)

*Currently, this guidance applies to HCP with potential exposure in a healthcare setting to patients with confirmed COVID-19.  However, HCP exposures could involve a PUI who is awaiting testing.  Implementation of monitoring and work restrictions described in this guidance could be applied to HCP exposed to a PUI if test results for the PUI are not expected to return within 48 to 72 hours.  A record of HCP exposed to a PUI should be maintained and HCP should be encouraged to perform self-monitoring while awaiting test results.  If the results will be delayed more than 72 hours or the patient is positive for COVID-19, then the monitoring and work restrictions described in this document should be followed.*

*Both high- and medium-risk exposures place HCP at more than low-risk for developing infection; therefore, the recommendations for active monitoring and work restrictions are the same for these exposures.  However, these risk categories were created to align with risk categories described in the Interim US Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Persons with Potential Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Exposure in Travel-associated or Community Settings, which outlines criteria for quarantine and travel restrictions specific to high-risk exposures.  Use that Interim Guidance for information about the movement, public activity, and travel restrictions that apply to the HCP included here.* 

*The highest risk exposure category that applies to each person should be used to guide monitoring and work restrictions.*

Note:  While respirators confer a higher level of protection than facemasks, and are recommended when caring for patients with COVID-19, facemasks still confer some level of protection to HCP, which was factored into our assessment of risk.

aThe risk category for these rows would be elevated by one level if HCP had extensive body contact with the patients (e.g., rolling the patient).

bThe risk category for these rows would be elevated by one level if HCP performed or were present for a procedure likely to generate higher concentrations of respiratory secretions or aerosols (e.g., cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation, extubation, bronchoscopy, nebulizer therapy, sputum induction). For example, HCP who were wearing a gown, gloves, eye protection and a facemask (instead of a respirator) during an aerosol-generating procedure would be considered to have a medium-risk exposure.

Additional Scenarios:

* Refer to the footnotes above for scenarios that would elevate the risk level for exposed HCP. For example, HCP who were wearing a gown, gloves, eye protection and a facemask (instead of a respirator) during an aerosol-generating procedure would be considered to have a medium-risk exposure.
* Proper adherence to currently recommended infection control practices, including all recommended PPE, should protect HCP having prolonged close contact with patients infected with COVID-19. However, to account for any inconsistencies in use or adherence that could result in unrecognized exposures, HCP should still perform self-monitoring with delegated supervision.
* HCP not using all recommended PPE who have only brief interactions with a patient regardless of whether patient was wearing a facemask are considered low-risk. Examples of brief interactions include:  brief conversation at a triage desk; briefly entering a patient room but not having direct contact with the patient or the patient‚Äôs  secretions/excretions; entering the patient room immediately after the patient was discharged.
* HCP who walk by a patient or who have no direct contact with the patient or their secretions/excretions and no entry into the patient room are considered to have no identifiable risk.

#### III. Recommendations for Monitoring Based on COVID-19 Exposure Risk

**HCP in any of the risk exposure categories who develop signs or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 must contact their established point of contact (public health authorities or their facility‚Äôs occupational health program) for medical evaluation prior to returning to work**

1. ***High- and Medium-risk*** **Exposure Category**  
**HCP in the high- or medium-risk category** should undergo active monitoring, including restriction from work in any healthcare setting until 14 days after their last exposure. If they develop any fever (measured temperature &gt;100.0oF or subjective fever) OR respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat)[\*](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/index.html?chost=tools.cdc.gov&amp;cpath=/medialibrary/index.aspx&amp;csearch=&amp;chash=%2Fmedia%2Fid%2F404340&amp;ctitle=Public%20Health%20Media%20Library&amp;wn=syndicationIframe&amp;wf=/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/&amp;wid=syndicationIframe1&amp;mMode=widget&amp;mPage=&amp;mChannel=&amp;class=rid_0efb07e6_404340&amp;iframeembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-widget-external-loader.js&amp;apiembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/html/js/embed-2.0.3.js&amp;iframe=true&amp;nw=true&amp;ns=cdc&amp;of=xhtml&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;cssclasses=syndicate,!no-syndicate&amp;stripstyles=true&amp;stripcomments=true&amp;stripimages=false&amp;stripanchors=false&amp;stripscripts=true&amp;mediaid=404340&amp;mediatype=html&amp;apiroot=//tools.cdc.gov/api#note1) they should immediately self-isolate (separate themselves from others) and notify their local or state public health authority and healthcare facility promptly so that they can coordinate consultation and referral to a healthcare provider for further evaluation.
2. ***Low-risk*** **Exposure Category**  
**HCP in the** ***low-risk*** **category** should perform self-monitoring with delegated supervision until 14 days after the last potential exposure.  Asymptomatic HCP in this category are not restricted from work.  They should check their temperature twice daily and remain alert for respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, sore throat)[\*](https://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/index.html?chost=tools.cdc.gov&amp;cpath=/medialibrary/index.aspx&amp;csearch=&amp;chash=%2Fmedia%2Fid%2F404340&amp;ctitle=Public%20Health%20Media%20Library&amp;wn=syndicationIframe&amp;wf=/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-syndication/&amp;wid=syndicationIframe1&amp;mMode=widget&amp;mPage=&amp;mChannel=&amp;class=rid_0efb07e6_404340&amp;iframeembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/contrib/widgets/tp-widget-external-loader.js&amp;apiembedsrc=//tools.cdc.gov/api/embed/html/js/embed-2.0.3.js&amp;iframe=true&amp;nw=true&amp;ns=cdc&amp;of=xhtml&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;cssclasses=syndicate,!no-syndicate&amp;stripstyles=true&amp;stripcomments=true&amp;stripimages=false&amp;stripanchors=false&amp;stripscripts=true&amp;mediaid=404340&amp;mediatype=html&amp;apiroot=//tools.cdc.gov/api#note1). They should ensure they are afebrile and asymptomatic before leaving home and reporting for work. If they do not have fever or respiratory symptoms they may report to work.  If they develop fever (measured temperature &gt; 100.0 oF or subjective fever) OR respiratory symptoms they should immediately self-isolate (separate themselves from others) and notify their local or state public health authority or healthcare facility promptly so that they can coordinate consultation and referral to a healthcare provider for further evaluation.On days HCP are scheduled to work, healthcare facilities could consider measuring  temperature and assessing symptoms prior to starting work.  Alternatively, facilities could consider having HCP report temperature and symptoms to occupational health prior to starting work.  Modes of communication may include telephone calls or any electronic or internet-based means of communication.
3. **HCP who Adhere to All Recommended Infection Prevention and Control Practices**  
Proper adherence to currently recommended infection control practices, including all recommended PPE, should protect HCP having prolonged close contact with patients infected with COVID-19.  However, to account for any inconsistencies in use or adherence that could result in unrecognized exposures, HCP should still perform self-monitoring with delegated supervision as described under the low-risk exposure category.
4. ***No Identifiable risk*** **Exposure Category**  
**HCP in the** ***no identifiable risk*** **category** do not require monitoring or restriction from work.
5. **Community or travel-associated exposures**  
HCP with potential exposures to COVID-19 in community settings, should have their exposure risk assessed according to [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html).  HCP should inform their facility‚Äôs occupational health program that they have had a community or travel-associated exposure.  HCP who have a community or travel-associated exposure should undergo monitoring as defined by that guidance.  Those who fall into the *high-* or *medium-* *risk* category described there should be excluded from work in a healthcare setting until 14 days after their exposure. HCP who develop signs or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 should contact their established point of contact (public health authorities or their facility‚Äôs occupational health program) for medical evaluation prior to returning to work.

**Additional Considerations and Recommendations:**

While contact tracing and risk assessment, with appropriate implementation of HCP work restrictions, of potentially exposed HCP remains the recommended strategy for identifying and reducing the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to HCP, patients, and others, it is not practical or achievable in all situations.  Community transmission of COVID-19 in the United States has been reported in multiple areas. This development means some recommended actions (e.g., contact tracing and risk assessment of all potentially exposed HCP) are impractical for implementation by healthcare facilities.  In the setting of community transmission, all HCP are at some risk for exposure to COVID-19, whether in the workplace or in the community.  Devoting resources to contact tracing and retrospective risk assessment could divert resources from other important infection prevention and control activities.  Facilities should shift emphasis to more routine practices, which include asking HCP to report recognized exposures, regularly monitor themselves for fever and symptoms of respiratory infection and not report to work when ill.  Facilities should develop a plan for how they will screen for symptoms and evaluate ill HCP.  This could include having HCP report absence of fever and symptoms prior to starting work each day.

Facilities could consider allowing asymptomatic HCP who have had an exposure to a COVID-19 patient to continue to work after options to improve staffing have been exhausted and in consultation with their occupational health program.  These HCP should still report temperature and absence of symptoms each day prior to starting work.  Facilities could have exposed HCP wear a facemask while at work for the 14 days after the exposure event if there is a sufficient supply of facemasks. If HCP develop even mild symptoms consistent with COVID-19, they must cease patient care activities, don a facemask (if not already wearing), and notify their supervisor or occupational health services prior to leaving work.

\* Fever is either measured temperature &gt;100.0oF or subjective fever. Note that fever may be intermittent or may not be present in some patients, such as those who are elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain medications (e.g., NSAIDs). Clinical judgement should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations. Respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are cough, shortness of breath, and sore throat. Medical evaluation may be recommended for lower temperatures (&lt; 100.0oF) or other symptoms (e.g., muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain headache, runny nose, fatigue) based on assessment by public health authorities.

fq48ur,The United States must give the world an account of the three doubts about the epidemic situation,"Some U.S. politicians have called the new coronavirus ""China virus"" many times recently, triggering criticism from the international community. ""Racism"", ""xenophobia"" and ""scapegoating"" have become high-frequency words used by European and American media to criticize the United States. Virus traceability is a scientific issue, and science needs evidence. In an interview recently, Giuseppe Remuzzi, director of the Italian Mario negri Institute of Pharmacology, said that Italy may have had unexplained pneumonia as early as November and December last year, which is highly suspected of having symptoms of newly diagnosed pneumonia. Therefore, he judged that the virus had spread at least in northern Lombardy, Italy, before the outbreak in China. This once again supports the view of Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese respiratory disease scientist, that the virus does not necessarily originate in China. British Sky News reporter Amanda Walker pointed out pointedly, ""If millions of Americans die, it will be the responsibility of the President. But calling it ""the Chinese virus"" is a way to avoid accusations. "" It can be seen that even if US politicians shout loudly, they cannot pass on the responsibility. On the contrary, they further expose many doubts in the prevention and control of the epidemic in the United States. The latest concern is that Australian Prime Minister Morrison said in an interview on the 20th that about 80% of the confirmed cases of newly diagnosed pneumonia in Australia are imported cases from overseas or people who have had direct contact with people returning from overseas, and in these cases, ""the majority of cases come from the United States"".

&amp;#x200B;

As more and more questions from the outside world point to the United States, the U.S. government must explain the three questions about the epidemic to the public and to the world. First of all, according to the latest estimates of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US flu season starting in September 2019 has infected more than 30 million Americans and killed more than 20,000 people. Robert redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recently admitted publicly that some flu deaths were actually caused by newly diagnosed pneumonia. So how many new cases of pneumonia are there among the 20,000-odd flu deaths? Has the US used the flu to cover up the new coronal pneumonia? If the US side has a clear conscience, it should immediately publish the official data and ask public health officials, experts and scholars to make positive responses. It can even invite WHO to send an investigation team to participate in the investigation. Explaining this issue clearly is not only the urgent need for the United States to deal with the current epidemic situation, but also an explanation for some Americans whose causes of death are unknown. After all, if a country can easily prevaricate and cover up the causes of people's deaths, what human rights and credibility is there? The second question the US needs to answer is: Why suddenly closed the Fort Detrick biological and chemical weapons base in July 2019? The base is the largest research and development center for biological and chemical weapons in the US military. The new york Times said that it was shut down because there was ""not enough perfect system to purify the waste water from its laboratory with the highest safety level"".

&amp;#x200B;

However, with the development of a series of subsequent events, people have doubts about the real reason for the closure of the base. Because shortly after it was shut down, a series of pneumonia or pneumonia-like cases occurred in the United States. Authorities blamed it on ""e-cigarettes"", but scientists pointed out that e-cigarettes could not explain its symptoms and illness. Almost at the same time, the U.S. H1N1 flu outbreak; In the following October 2019, several U.S. agencies organized a global epidemic exercise code-named ""Event 201"". In December 2019, Wuhan's first patient infected with new crown pneumonia developed symptoms. In February 2020, the new crown epidemic broke out in many places around the world. Judging from the time line, the occurrence of this series of events is very strange. Is there any connection between them? A few days ago, some people posted on the White House petition website, asking the US government to announce the real reason for the closure of Fort Detrick, in order to clarify whether it is the research unit of the new crown virus and whether there is a virus leak problem. If the United States really considers the life and health of its citizens, it should answer these questions. The third question is: why did the U.S. government downplay the country's new pneumonia epidemic in mid-February when several Senate intelligence Committee officials sold millions of shares? Are politicians hiding the epidemic from the public while using insider trading to sell stocks? Do they give priority to capital rather than life when facing the epidemic? According to a report in the Washington Post on the 20th, US intelligence officials issued several warnings as early as January this year that novel coronavirus could lead to a global crisis and stressed the need for government action. However, the U.S. government did not declare a ""state of emergency"" until March 13. Why is the United States wasting the window period China has paid a huge price for the world? U.S. politicians must explain clearly these issues concerning human lives. As of 23: 00 local time on the 21st, the number of confirmed cases of newly diagnosed pneumonia in the United States rose to 26,747, with 340 deaths. The epidemic prevention and control situation has become more and more severe. In times of crisis, the behavior of some American politicians, as Herali, author of A Brief History of Humankind, commented on it in a recent article, ""never take responsibility, never admit mistakes, all credit belongs to oneself, all responsibility belongs to others"".

fq5xz2,Why coronavirus is a symptom of capitalism,"The coronavirus is a result of the capitalist system that puts profit over anything. The animal market in china is advertised and supported by the government even after the first pandemic of SARS. An economic system which is based on consuming can't be sustainable. Even after this, the market continued. When a chinese doctor found out about the virus, the government tried to hide it as long as they could so they could go on like they were until now.
Because the capitalist market was left alone, and because profit is weighed above life, the coronavirus spread. Due to poverty and weak social nets, the poor class is pressured to go to work, and thus, have a high chance of catching the virus. What does an infected mother of three who works in a grocery store without any insured sick days do? She goes to work. The global capitalist economy has shown to be extremely fragile, and one that does not work for most of us.
Due to the Coronavirus, society has come to a halt. Most productivity is stopped, which has various effects on our way of life. Our economy is starting to collapse, what strongly correlates with less environmental damage. Our economic system is based on growing in a sense that the GDP gets bigger every year, what about a system that doesn't focus on  the growing of the GDP but the growing of the welfare? A system which is based on offering value for others not only for yourself. A system, which takes us out of self centered survival mode, a system in which one builds a business to help the world, not to earn money. Humans are a social species. Its their natural instinct to help others, don't let this get suppressed by a system in which‚Ä¶. In such situations, we see how important it is that we act as a whole, big problems like this can only be solved by big solutions. It's not the problem of the individual people that this disaster had happened, it's the system that makes people behave like this because making profit is what is considered successful in our society. 
Our mass media makes us panic. People live in fear and worry which makes them easy to manipulate and they want to have an authority figure in such situations.Fear brings us into mode that serves us when we hunted animals, our problems now cant be solved with fight or flight, but with strategy and clear thinking, the government wants you to panic so they can easily make you follow them.Capitalism made sense when the world wasn't as connected as now, when you looked after your family and your actions didn't have such a big influence on the whole world as now. Now, there is no more ethical consumption. Every product we buy has only the purpose of taking our money. Have you ever thought that why, after billions spent on research, our smart phones stop working after a couple of years ? Our whole economy is based on this logic. 
The corona virus is only one symptom of a much bigger problem, if we keep trying to fight the symptoms that occur, it is an unending fight. Let's think for ourselves and get to understand the root causes of today's problems. Should we trust the system and the people which brought us into this to fix the problems for us? After this crisis, no one can look at capitalism the same as before. Because of out privilege, we didn‚Äôt realize the destruction of capitalism before, since it was most detrimental in third world countries. We didn‚Äôt care, because also we profited from their struggle and exploitation. This is a wake up call, capitalism doesn‚Äôt work.",jbeck222,2020-03-27 14:15:11,0,633,76.7,85.87,26.43,8.69,18.62,18.01,89.89,55.29,13.59,6.95,0,4.27,1.11,0.16,1.42,6.64,9.16,15.32,8.53,4.74,5.85,2.53,16.9,5.85,4.11,3.16,1.26,2.21,6.16,2.37,3.79,1.11,0.63,0.16,10.58,0.32,0,0.32,0,13.43,2.53,5.06,2.05,1.42,0.79,2.69,1.26,0.63,0.16,0.16,2.05,0.16,1.58,0,0.32,15.17,5.06,2.84,4.27,1.74,2.21,3.32,13.11,0.16,14.22,2.05,7.27,4.9,4.74,0.16,0.16,3.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.8,5.06,5.21,0,0,0.63,0,0,0,1.9,0,0
fq5y45,Getting my boyfriend to understand that social distancing includes him,"If you want a more detailed explanation check some of my other recent posts.

The TL;DR version is: my boyfriend and his mother, who he lives with, are both high risk. My parents, who I live with, are both high risk. My boyfriend keeps trying to get me to visit him and I've tried to explain again and again that I CAN'T.

I've softened it a bit by saying that if both of our households try to self isolate as much as possible for a few weeks (going out only for absolute necessities like groceries, work related things, wearing masks and staying away from others as much as possible while doing it) I will see if I can visit him, maybe for a relatively long period of time to avoid too much back and forth.

Except that his mother keeps going to friend's houses. And my parents, by the nature of their work, cannot completely self isolate and avoid interacting with people.

So it seems that realistically, I won't be able to see my boyfriend until whenever social distancing stops being necessary. Which I am optimistically trying to think might be a month or so, but realistically I know it could be closer to a year.

It sucks a lot! But what makes it suck more is that my boyfriend keeps trying to argue with me that it's not necessary for us to socially distance from one another. His view is that so long as we're all careful to wash our hands and just stay in our houses as much as possible otherwise it's fine to visit your SO. And maybe that would be true, if he wasn't living with someone who clearly doesn't give a fuck about flouting social distancing guidelines. 

So, any advice on how to get through to him? 

I posted in r/advice and got responses from some clueless, ignorant folks that tried to tell me I'm being silly and overreacting, so I'm hopeful there will be some more serious, rational advice from people here.",pyritha,2020-03-27 14:15:23,0,350,30,62.34,37.83,3.68,21.88,16.29,95.14,56.57,19.43,11.43,6.57,1.43,0.57,2.57,0.29,8,2.86,15.14,8.57,6.29,10.29,1.71,20.29,6.29,3.71,2,0.29,5.43,4.57,1.14,3.43,1.14,1.14,0.57,14.86,1.43,1.43,0.57,4,15.43,2.29,1.14,2.29,6.57,2,4.57,1.43,0.86,0.29,0.29,2.57,0.57,1.43,0.29,0.29,11.43,4.86,2.57,1.14,1.14,1.71,1.43,14,2,10.57,2,5.71,3.71,0.57,0,0.86,0,0,0,1.14,0.86,0.29,0,0,0,13.71,3.71,4.57,0.29,0.29,0.29,0.29,0,0,3.43,0.57,0.29

fq6tae,COVID reimbursement questions...,"I am a 26 year old man who, after several years of being mentally guilt tripped to staying with my grandparents in the Arizona family home, decided to get the heck out of dodge and drive several states over to move in with my best friends in Alabama. I left on March 19, and arrived Midnight on the 21st. 3 days later, New Mexico's borders closed. I am currently working on filling out the application for the apartment, address change at the USPS, etc.


But the news came out of the reimbursement checks  being issued, and one of the main things that hurts me is I am to be given no compensation as my grandfather has claimed me as a dependent for this year, and every year prior. We have already filed our taxes (myself, and my grandfather, separately) during the first month we were able to, as we've always been proactive.

However, I have been more at risk to this COVID outbreak than anyone else in my family and it wasn't even a thing back when we filed taxes. Is there any way I can get the $1200, or am I stuck with nothing because for the longest time, keeping a positive relationship with my family was more important than moving out and proving to them I'm not a baby with the IQ of a peanut, and CAN take care of myself?

If this is not the right place to ask this, where can I go to get an answer?

It might be worth mentioning that I have never been in debt, have been reliably employed for a majority of my adult life, and am fully capable of sustaining myself. The fact that this COVID reimbursement news came out of nowhere and is being applied to 2019 taxes, not 2020 taxes, just kinda makes me a tiny bit upset.

fqcdn5,"The World Enemy Are The Antichrist, Authorities, Governments, And Not The Corona Virus NCOV","**The World Enemy Are The Antichrist, Authorities, Governments, And Not The Corona Virus NCOV**

The real world common enemy are the authorities, governments, royal families and antichrist in general. They only care for their secret societies group and do not care for the people.  
 The have absolutely zero life survival fighting spirit.

They have called this is a war but they already surrendered before going into the battle.

Why I have said that?  
 Look at the Euro 2020 and Tokyo Olympic 2020.Those events need only around 1 month from start to finish.And we are you just in the third months of the year 2020. It is too early to make any decision.

So if the Corona Virus NCOV problems solved within the next 6 months or so, you can still able to have both Euro 2020 and Tokyo Olympic 2020 happen in real 2020, but not in 2021 like they have re-scheduled.

What a bunch of pathetic coward leaders &amp; governments who only care about money business.

Speaking about the new Corona Virus NCOV.  
 **The fact is that I already have perfect public cur &amp; solution for everybody.**

I just want the authorities &amp; governments have a public official uncensored platform to share it freely online, so no any entities can steal it.

All of them are refusing to talk. They think they can continue ‚Äúenslave‚Äù people, they think they are ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù than the rest and the ‚Äúcure &amp; solution‚Äù will come out from the ‚Äúlower grade‚Äù entities and then they will claim the credit public.

But the fact is that all the smart people already laugh behind the screen and waiting for the ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù to show up their talents, from both East and West.

If those antichrist do not wake up from those illusion then they are all deserve to be dead.

The NCOV do not go into every house to infect people, people are misunderstanding that powerful natural component. If you do not wake up and study them and treat them as a crazy powerful friend, then there is no way for you to survive out of this global crazy epidemic event.

Don't just bitch to each other about what you think isn't being done at work to protect you (if you are considered essential and are going to work rather than working from home). Make reasonable suggestions about what you would like to see happen and what will make you feel safer going to work.

And also ask yourself if you are doing everything YOU should be doing to protect yourself.

Are you social distancing? Properly washing your hands for 20 seconds after touching your face or something that may be contaminated? Using a paper towel to open the bathroom door then throwing it away? Sneezing or coughing into your elbow or a tissue then using hand sanitizer? (it needs to be wet for at least 20 seconds) Not touching your face? Using hand sanitizer after going to the store and wiping down everything you touched in your car and in your home with a disinfecting wipe? Changing your clothes as soon as you get home and washing the ones you were wearing immediately?  And then washing your hands again? 

Are you staying home unless it's absolutely necessary to go out, or are you making an excuse to go out 2-3 times a day because you ""need"" something when you're really just bored? Are you panic buying toilet paper and bottled water and everything else the stores are now constantly out of, and being part of the problem?

People typically spend less than 1/2 their day at work. Before you start bitching about your employer (I mean, you still have a job, right?) take a hard look at yourself and your actions and what YOU are actively doing to prevent contracting and spreading the virus. Yes, employers have a responsibility to try to prevent the spread, but you have a responsibility to use whatever is available to protect yourself too.",freeballingstupid,2020-03-27 21:26:17,0,326,42.44,95.4,37.06,13.35,17.16,19.94,91.72,58.28,16.56,11.66,0.61,0,10.43,0,0.61,4.91,4.91,14.42,10.12,6.13,8.9,1.23,20.86,4.91,3.07,1.84,1.84,1.23,2.76,0.92,1.84,0.31,0.92,0,14.11,0,0,0,0,14.72,1.53,3.07,2.45,3.37,2.15,5.21,3.99,0.61,0.31,3.07,4.29,2.76,1.23,0,0.31,5.83,0.31,1.84,0.92,0.61,2.15,0.61,14.42,2.76,14.11,2.76,5.83,5.83,3.68,0.31,1.84,1.23,0,0,1.23,0.61,0,0.61,0,0,12.88,2.76,2.15,0,0,3.37,0,0.31,0.61,1.53,1.84,0.31

The way I understand it (and I could be wrong) regular exposure to bacteria and whatnot from other people helps keep our immune systems strong.  Is there risk after the stay at home orders are lifted that we'll be more susceptible to flu-like diseases due to the isolation?

Please know I'm not asking this as a way to encourage people to go out and do stupid stuff, it's just genuine curiosity.

Tuesday - chest tightness improves slightly, cough still persistent, another episode of chills for 10 minutes at night
Wednesday - woke up essentially paralyzed - entire back muscles on both sides completely strained to the point of only being able to breathe in about 35% lung capacity before clenching up from pain. Hot shower helped a LOT but pain remained as soon as I got out, spent the entire day laying on a hardwood floor breathing very shallowly. Other symptoms: chest tightness improves more, cough lessens but is still persistent, began coughing up phlegm instead of dry cough

Also, I know the company isn‚Äôt at fault here but I somewhat just feel so angry at them for laying off all their employees, who are living paycheck to paycheck.

It just angers me to see that he made his district so successful and then for the company to just dump him now. It hurts me for my dad, who has earned his place, and stresses me out for my whole family.

fqi2nl,Is Trump Holding Medical Equipment Hostage in Return for Votes and support?,"I would love to know what others think about this. 

It seems that Governors who do not agree with Trump, go against what he says, or he just does not like, are not receiving the desperately needed life-saving equipment they were promised.

I am reading about, and hearing his own words where he says ""Governors that are nice to us"" or ""treat us right"". I find it terrifying to think that this man is in charge of allocating resources and we all know he is not above blackmail to get what he wants.

This might explain why some Governors have been slow to issue a stay at home or shelter in place order. Is Trump telling them that if they do, he will not provide medical assistance?

fqlxtr,My roommate does not respect social distancing,"Hi, I live in Quebec, Canada with one roommate who is my friend as well. 

I was away for 2 weeks with my boyfriend where we self-isolated for the entire time. I was in contact with my roommate just checking up to see how she was doing and heard that she was going to her friends‚Äô apartments everyday because she was lonely and wanted something to do.

Since I live with her, I became a little anxious since I don‚Äôt want to contribute to any possibility of spreading it to other people in our community or even getting sick myself. But I wasn‚Äôt in the apartment and she‚Äôs a very social person so I didn‚Äôt say anything since I didn‚Äôt want to affect her mental health.

I just recently came back to our apartment (my boyfriend dropped me off outside) and had many things planned to keep her occupied so she would feel the need to go out and meet with people since we do need to self-isolate. However, a few of her friends unexpectedly showed up at our door and invited themselves in. She hung out with them for an our in our living room and I was confined to my own room since I didn‚Äôt want to interact with them. They weren‚Äôt wearing any gloves and probably touches many things before entering our apartment which they then proceeded to touch a lot of our belongings as well. Later that night she went out to a friends place to have dinner and didn‚Äôt return until around 2AM.

She complains that people are being too paranoid and that the news is mostly fake so she doesn‚Äôt trust it. So I‚Äôve felt ashamed to talk to her about my concerns regarding her actions. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where I‚Äôm sacrificing my own mental health for hers despite her actions being selfish considering the situation.

My boyfriend and I have even agreed not to see each other, especially not to go in each other‚Äôs houses, except for brief walks where we have a considerable amount of distance between us. I‚Äôm making all these calls to ensure I don‚Äôt contribute to a chain of possible infections which include her but she‚Äôs not doing the same.

I don‚Äôt know what to do to make her understand that what she‚Äôs doing is going against all the recommendations and making me extremely anxious everyday.",gottalovereddit182,2020-03-28 08:11:33,2,408,36.62,66.17,50.52,8.31,24,17.65,94.12,62.99,22.06,16.67,7.35,2.7,0,5.39,1.23,5.39,3.92,18.14,10.05,5.88,6.37,3.43,19.12,3.19,1.47,2.21,0.49,2.94,3.92,1.23,2.7,0.98,0,0.74,16.91,0,2.7,5.39,0.74,14.46,1.47,2.7,1.72,2.45,1.72,4.66,2.21,0.74,0.49,0.98,2.21,0.25,1.72,0,0.25,8.82,6.86,0.25,0.98,0.49,0.25,5.15,10.78,0.74,14.71,2.7,7.84,4.66,0,0,2.7,0,0.25,0,0.49,0,0,0,0.49,0,11.03,3.92,1.47,0,0,0,0,0.49,0,4.66,0.49,0

Usually I would talk to my mom or ask a doctor, but she recently passed and there are no Dr appointments for like a month. 

Should I go back to work? Who should I ask if I can't get an appointment?

fqou28,Make sure you‚Äôre using household disinfectants properly!,"Hey everyone, 

I‚Äôm a microbiologist at Duke university. I mostly research new disinfectants in clinical environments. Given that, I‚Äôve always assumed folks usually read and follow the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions on the product labels. I have never been more wrong. After discussing with my friends and family, small sample size I know, I‚Äôve realized this is not the norm and right now it really needs to be. I‚Äôve recently started to blog to improve my writing and discuss my work which I think is highly relevant at the moment. Now that the overwhelming majority of folks are home, and those deemed essential and are still going out daily, it‚Äôs imperative you‚Äôre actually ridding your house of COVID-19. Hope this helps!

fqoytg,A Research result from China: No big difference between infection rate of patients with symptoms and asymptomatic patients - Summary in English,"The results showed that the infection rate of close contacts of confirmed patients was 6.3% and that of asymptomatic infection was 4.11%. The researchers believe that there is no statistically significant difference in infection rates.

An article  entitled ""Analysis of Epidemiological Characteristics of Infections in Close Contacts of COVID-19 in Ningbo"" published by Chen Yi et al. , in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology, vol. 41, 2020.  (Note: not able to verify the original article)

For COVID-19, recurrence rate of family members, relatives, and friends is high. Among different contact methods, co-living infection rates are the highest, suggesting that long-term unprotected close contact is a high risk factor for Sars-CoV-2 infection. 

A total of 157 locally reported confirmed cases and 30 asymptomatic infections, which together determined 2,147 close contacts were included in this study. 

The number of close contacts of a patient (with symptom or asymptomatic) was range from 0 to 111, and an average of 11.5 close contacts for each patient. 

Of the 2147 close contacts, a total of 110 developed into confirmed cases and 22 becomes asymptomatic patients. The total infection rate of close contacts was 6.15%.

fqytod,What do you think of this idea for coping with quarantine?,"I'm 17F, and I've been in quarantine for like 2 weeks now, which really sucks. It's an especially bad experience for me because it's really taking a toll on my mental health. I thought it might just be me at first, but I have been noticing a lot of posts about it on reddit and social media in general. It seems like this is a popular thing with teens/college students, and the added stress of online school is just making it worse. 

I'm thinking about maybe starting some kind of website/textline/some other platform that connects teens looking for someone to talk to with a volunteer who is happy to listen and give advice. Confidential, live, one on one conversations. The volunteer would be a teen, too, so it would be a teens helping teens (and other young people) thing, I guess. That would make it a valuable counseling resource some and a great volunteer opportunity for others.

I‚Äôve seen lots of articles saying it‚Äôs fairly safe. The highest risk would be if you see the delivery person face-to-face. And lots of restaurants have COVID-19 responses and heightened cleaning schedules.

If you still have food delivered, what additional pre-cautions do you take? 

If you have completely stopped getting food delivered, what‚Äôs your reasoning behind it?

I'm also the least hypochondriac there is. However yesterday I woke up with a really dry throat and cotton mouth through out the day. I developed a fever, nothing crazy, but was definitely running hot thoughout the day. I've been coughing but I wouldn't say it is a consistent cough unless I breathe deep but I wouldn't say I have shortness of breath. I have had a lingering headache for about 4 days now but yesterday was definitely the worst. I woke up today not feeling great but not un manageable. My throat is still dry and a little sore but is better than it was yesterday. After researching everything because I kept telling myself that there's no way, I'm starting to doubt myself. Now in my city of San Antonio it's really hard to get tested unless you have orders from a doctor and I don't feel my symptoms are intense enough to get that.

What the latest  1003 stat shows without doubt is that giving that chloroquine protocol  as early as covid tested and assuming we have this strategy in place and  we don't wait for the covid-19 to evolve into pneumonia/lung  infection/death, then it's confirmed that it reduces mortality rate, and quite sensibly.",theautomaticsociety,2020-03-29 07:43:10,1,443,82.02,68.22,3.57,46.57,36.92,23.7,46.73,25.06,7,3.61,0.23,0.9,0.9,1.13,0.45,3.39,2.71,7.22,4.29,1.81,3.84,1.13,7.22,4.51,2.93,0.23,7.22,1.35,1.58,1.35,0.23,0.23,0,0,5.64,0,0,0,1.35,4.51,2.03,0.23,0.23,0.68,0.45,1.35,0.45,0.45,0,0,0.9,0.23,0.68,0,0,4.97,2.03,0.68,1.35,0.9,0.23,3.16,4.29,0.68,7.9,0.45,3.16,4.29,1.81,0.9,0,0,0,1.35,3.39,0,3.39,0,0,0,50.11,8.35,2.26,0.68,1.81,0.9,0,14,0,0.68,2.26,19.19

Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect COVID-19 from cough sound recordings:


Our vision is that every coughing person can get tested for COVID-19 at zero costs directly from home. An AI detects how likely you have COVID-19 simply from your cough sound recording.

 

DISCLAIMER: 

The diagnostics function is not live yet, as this is a proof of concept before launching a clinical trial. By uploading your cough sound recording already now, you make a valuable contribution to getting this tool ready for a broader audience.

It's not enough for me to be like ""omg I can't breathe"" or immediately assume I'm sick. At first I was thinking it may be due to working from home the past week and not having a good chair, so my posture's messed up?

fri5ri,This research indicates SARS entered cells through alternate receptor. What about COVID?,"SARS and SARS-COV-2 are very similar

‚ÄúHuman ACE2 is an efficient receptor for SARS-CoV. It is a zinc-containing carboxypeptidase that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the renin‚Äìangiotensin system and regulates heart function, mainly by maintaining blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis (35, 36). 

Northern blotting showed that ACE2 mRNA is expressed abundantly in endothelial cells of the heart, kidneys, and testis (37). In addition, RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry showed that ACE2 mRNA and protein are expressed on oral, nasal, and intestinal mucosa, alveolar epithelial cells in lung, stomach, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen liver, kidney, and brain, and arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in many organs (38‚Äì41). 

These sites for ACE2 expression include most of the sites for SARS-CoV replication in autopsy specimens (26). 

Our data show that human CD209L can also mediate infection by SARS-CoV, although it is a much less efficient receptor than human ACE2. Fig. 5 shows that CD209L is expressed in human lung on type II alveolar cells, which are an important target for SARS-CoV infection (13, 25), and on endothelial cells.‚Äú

frsryt,Deep Clean - Prevent Clinical Coronavirus Spread,"Deep Clean watches a room and flags all surfaces as they are touched for special attention on the next cleaning to help prevent the spread of contagious disease.

One use case would be in a hospital room. When a patient checks out, the cleaning service could view all surfaces that need special attention.

How it Works

\----

Deep Clean uses a stereo camera to detect the depth (z-coordinate) of an object of interest (e.g. a hand) in the video frame. OpenPose is used to detect hand location (x,y-coordinates). When a hand is at the same position and depth as another object in view (i.e. touching), that location is tracked. An image can be generated showing all surfaces that have been touched.

Upper management emailed their bosses and I was given a fucking FAQ and told that my company, being essential and all, doesn‚Äôt have to FOLLOW CDC GUIDELINES bc we are ‚Äúexempt‚Äù and that they didn‚Äôt have to supply us with masks or any extra ppe bc they‚Äôre only obligated to provide standard issue ppe. üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

One of my coworkers just came back from vacationing in Florida like 5 days ago. My company was forced to change occupancy and capacity and also screen for temperature for donors AND EMPLOYEES (bc they weren‚Äôt screening employees at all) and they just started that Friday the 27th of March, almost a week into my city‚Äôs ‚Äústay home‚Äù order. I‚Äôm also pretty confident a regular donor tested positive in my city but our company won‚Äôt confirm and says it‚Äôs a rumor. I‚Äôm honestly wondering if the health department would even notify us if that is the case. 
 
So, beside the fact that I apparently work for daleks, that‚Äôs the background of my awesome dalek company ok? 

So maybe 1.5 weeks ago they upped the ‚Äúdonation‚Äù payment for employees who donate, to 70$/donation up from the usual 50$/donation. But they never upped the payment for donors. Regular donors get 20-25$ for each. Plus bonuses that could add up to 200$ a month on top of the regular payment but employees get bonuses too. donors don‚Äôt really get much for they‚Äôre plasma.

My company didn‚Äôt want to enforce protocols bc it would impede their sales numbers... they wouldn‚Äôt be able to get the numbers! But then why up employee donor pay if your worried about getting donors? Up the donor pay and we coulda been packed to the rafters for these last couple weeks. Since we squeezed through half of a 2 week lockdown in direct violation anyway...? 

Weird or not weird? Especially since there‚Äôs a brand new promising plasma treatment for the seriously infectious virus? Hm. Btw... if your body has to fight a virus... A NEW VIRUS... I‚Äôm gonna tell you right fucking now you NEED YOUR GOD DAMN PLASMA. Especially essential fucking workers! Why would you incentivize YOUR WORKERS to donate plasma (twice a week max‚Äîup to 1760 ml per week) if you‚Äôre not protecting them from contracting a virus, which, if they contract, would require the use of their own damn plasma?!?!? ANNNND they are collecting plasma that is likely positive for covid and I‚Äôve gotten no new sops on them testing plasma for covid rn. Humans can‚Äôt even get tested rn. I‚Äôm fucking blew rn. I just can‚Äôt. 

You can‚Äôt tell people shit. They aren‚Äôt even testing in my city. You have to be damn near dead to get tested here. Right outside Chicago. 12 positive cases in my city. What a joke. 

I worked till last Thursday when I found out two workers at my neighborhood Walgreens tested positive. I couldn‚Äôt continue to go to work knowing I‚Äôd definitely been exposed just walking in the store. My boss texted me 3 days later asking if I felt well enough to come to worküòñ 
Who will be left to harvest your god damn plasma when nobody can come to work at all bc the entire staff is ill?!? 
there is no lockdown here.

Why not May 1st or suspend in person classes for the rest of the semester and start online classes?  In order for every student and faculty member to return to schools, wouldn't they have to test all students and faculty to make sure no one is carrying?  Especially if those that might have it show little to no symptoms....

The stimulus package is supposed to be a one time thing in April, but that's clearly not going to be enough.  Our Governor has just requested a greater stimulus package because he knows, the previous agreement will not suffice, especially for people that are still paying rent/bills.

If you look at Canada, they are recieved $2000 and are way more prepared than the U.S ever could've been.  Out of the 1300 plus cases...300 plus have been in my county.

# What already happened

Busy hours for internet providers have slid off to earlier in the day, as everyone now either watches TV-series, or downloads them to watch later, from the afternoon on.¬†

Mark Zuckerberg has already confirmed that through WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger people are now making twice as many calls compared to usual. Scott Petty, Director, Enterprise Products and Solutions has pointed out that the internet busy hours are now spread between noon and 9 pm.

Internet providers see traffic growth, services feel overloaded, users are witnessing and complaining about slow internet, longer buffering times and lags in online games.

An obvious solution applied by the largest video services in the first place has been to temporarily lower the quality - Netflix and Youtube announced that on March 19.

‚ÄúStreaming platforms, telecom operators and users, we all have a joint responsibility to take steps to ensure the smooth functioning of the Internet during the battle against the virus propagation"", ‚Äî European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, Thierry Breton stated. According to the executive, the Commission would like to see web users themselves taking more responsibility in their online habits, bearing in mind the current strain networks are under.

# How it all started...

Italy.¬†

On February 23 local authorities shut down most stores in 10 towns of Lombardy, and asked their citizens to refrain from any non urgent movements. But there was still no panic and people kept living their regular lives. On February 25, the regional Governor Attilio Fontana addressed the regional parliament saying that coronavirus is ‚Äújust like flu‚Äù, after which all the earlier established restrictions were dismissed. But on March 1 they had to reestablish those as the number of infected people kept increasing.¬†

So what‚Äôs with the internet usage?¬†

The chart below shows us that on March 1 the time of first buffering went up.¬†

*First buffering is the time spent by the user waiting for the video to start after clicking Play.* 

&amp;#x200B;

On March 1 people started to spend more time at home overloading internet providers - so the issues in video delivery quality started to occur.

The next spike on March 10 coincides with the day of the quarantine established for the whole country. The issues with the networks‚Äô bandwidth became obvious already then. But the decision about lowering the quality of the largest services was made only 9 days later.

&amp;#x200B;

The same situation was seen in South Korea: the state shut down schools and kindergartens on February 27, which was followed by the network overload - with a slight delay: until February 28 the bandwidth was enough.

Similar graphs can be built for any country, with the use of [Vigo Leap](http://vigo.one/). Vigo uses real user experience stats data from partnering internet services to build such charts, helping services to carry out the right approach in improving the quality of experience for their users.

# What‚Äôs next

The Internet helps people to stay at home, helps to overcome stress by watching movies, TV-shows or vines. The importance of it is doubtless: nowadays when everything is shut down, internet providers are being advised to not cut off users even if their subscriptions are expired.¬†

The decision made by the largest world‚Äôs services to decrease the video quality could not be more wanted in this situation. Every service with this kind of technology should have done that before the first internet black-outs and economic consequences.¬†

Increased traffic means extra costs for ISPs that will finally turn out as costs incurred by subscribers. General network overload causes trouble also for other types of traffic, from banking transactions to online video conferences between colleagues now working from home. All that is damaging the economy at a large scale - and is getting on people‚Äôs nerves.

It is important to make the right decisions at the moment when the limits of ISP‚Äôs channels are reached. Most of the countries are now at that point.¬†

# What can you do about that?

This article is a call-out to all Video services to use Vigo in order to make timely decisions about limiting the quality for certain regions. There is no need in lowering the quality overall. CDN networks and the diversity of ISPs allow to decrease the quality only where it is really needed.

This kind of complex decisions can be made easily with Vigo Leap solution that allows to estimate and track issues with video delivery quality by countries and regions, ISPs, ASNs, CNDs.

Vigo Leap is free of charge for internet services operating at any platform. It‚Äôs free not because of the recent trend during the pandemic - we have been helping several dozens of internet services for 7 years now without charging them.

It gives a possibility to predict issues on the side of end-users and take preventive measures to keep them happy, rather than act based upon the number of complaints registered by your customer care service.¬†

Why would you do all that? Besides the solidarity with ISPs helping them to withstand the strain of customer demand, this kind of measures will help you to sustain the high quality of your service that is a direct influence on your users‚Äô satisfaction. A happy customer means your own money.¬†

Let us tell you more about Vigo Leap‚Äôs way of helping you to make your service best of breed - go to [http://vigo.one](http://vigo.one/) and request a demo.

P.S.

We also help ISPs to make grounded decisions when managing their network quality investments. Vigo‚Äôs solutions for ISPs and mobile operators allow them to promptly discover points of most network load caused by traffic growth and issues in infrastructure nodes that influence NPS (net promotion score, or customer satisfaction index) the most.¬†

Vigo for ISPs is able to localise network issues down to a building or a base station, defining the reasons for those.

fsevdm,In russia,"I will tell you about Covid-19 in Russia. 
And a little to myself. 
Last week in Moscow, and then throughout the country, they introduced a self-isolation regime. No one calls a quarantine a quarantine. There is a word for self-isolation.
Almost all jobs were closed. Only food stores and pharmacies are available 
It is forbidden to move around the city. Almost like in China.
People are sitting without a salary.
And if Moscow introduced a benefit in the amount of 19500 rubles. ( 230 dollars) then in other regions - silence 
People are offered to stay at home, not work. And not to eat. Because there is no money.
What to do is unclear. How to live on too 
The saddest thing is that I had heart surgery before that. Broken arm. That is, there are no savings at all. Now I have to survive without money. How to do this is unclear

fslguo,Only isolating seniors,"Not trying to be political - I'm looking for actual sources that can explain why this idea will/wont work. 

Why cant we all go back to work while imposing a mandatory strict X week quarantine on seniors (65+) and vulnerable (immunocompromised) people? Wont that isolate the vulnerable while those who can (statistically speaking) have a better chance of fighting it off without hospitalization live and work through it? Then we build herd immunity, keep businesses rolling (despite all getting covid at some point and losing a week of work, at least businesses are open). Is this too idealistic to implement, i.e. seniors will catch it since it will run rampant with the younger people?
